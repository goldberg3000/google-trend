                "content": "Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (Spanish pronunciation: [reˈal maˈðɾið ˈkluβ ðe ˈfuðβol] ⓘ), commonly referred to as Real Madrid, is a Spanish professional football club based in Madrid. The club competes in La Liga, the top tier of Spanish football. Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since its inception. The honorific title real is Spanish for \"royal\" and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 alongside with the crown in the club crest. Real Madrid have played their home matches in the 85,000-capacity Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting clubs, Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout its history. The official Madrid anthem is the \"Hala Madrid y nada más\", written by RedOne and Manuel Jabois.[8] The club is one of the most widely supported in the world and is the most followed football club on social media according to the CIES Football Observatory as of 2023.[9][10] It was estimated to be worth $6.6 billion in 2024, making it the world's most valuable football club.[11] In 2024, Real Madrid become the first football club to make €1 billion ($1.08bn) in revenue according to the club's announcement.[12] In domestic football, the club has won 71 trophies; a record 36 La Liga titles, 20 Copa del Rey, 13 Supercopa de España, a Copa Eva Duarte and a Copa de la Liga.[13] In International football, Real Madrid have won a record 34 trophies: a record 15 European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, a record six UEFA Super Cups, two UEFA Cups, a joint record two Latin Cups, a record one Iberoamerican Cup, and a record eight FIFA Club World championships.[note 1] Madrid was ranked first in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 2000, 2002, 2014, 2017.[17] In UEFA, Madrid ranks first in the all-time club ranking.[18][19] Being one of the three founding members of La Liga that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929 (along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona), Real Madrid has many long-standing rivalries, most notably El Clásico with Barcelona and El Derbi Madrileño with Atlético Madrid. The club established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s and 60s, winning five consecutive and six overall European Cups and reaching a further two finals. This success was replicated on the domestic front, with Madrid winning 12 league titles in 16 years. This team, which included Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás, Paco Gento and Raymond Kopa is considered, by some in the sport, to be the greatest of all time.[20][21] Real Madrid is known for its Galácticos policy, which involves signing the world's best players, such as Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane and David Beckham to create a superstar team.[22] The term 'Galácticos policy' generally refers to the two eras of Florentino Pérez's presidency of the club (2000–2006 and 2009–2018); however, players brought in just before his tenure are sometimes considered to be part of the Galácticos legacy. A notable example is Steve McManaman, who like many other players also succeeded under the policy.[23] On 26 June 2009, Madrid signed Cristiano Ronaldo for a record-breaking £80 million (€94 million);[24] he became both the club's and history's all-time top goalscorer.[25][26][27][28] Madrid have recently relaxed the Galácticos policy, instead focusing on signing young talents such as Vinícius Júnior, Rodrygo, Jude Bellingham[29] and Kylian Mbappé.[30][31] Real Madrid is recognised as the greatest football club of the 20th century by FIFA and as the best European club during the same timeframe by the IFFHS,[32] while also receiving the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit in 2004.[33] Real Madrid has the highest participations in the European Cup/Champions League (43),[18] a tournament in which they hold the overall record for the most wins, most draws and most goals scored.[34] Real Madrid is the only club to have won three consecutive titles (three-peat) in the European Cup/Champions League twice, first in 1955–56, 1956–57, and 1957–58, and second in 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18. In June 2024, they won a record-extending 15th Champions League title (the fifth in nine seasons), recognised as such by Guinness World Records.[35] Real Madrid is the first club across all of Europe's top-five leagues to win 100 trophies in all competitions.[36] As of July 2024,[update] Real Madrid are ranked 2nd in the UEFA club rankings and first in last 10 years (2013–2023) overall.[37][38] Real Madrid's origins go back to when football was introduced to Madrid by the academics and students of the Institución Libre de Enseñanza, which included several Cambridge and Oxford University graduates.[39] They founded (Sociedad) Sky Football in 1897, commonly known as La Sociedad (The Society) as it was the only one based in Madrid, playing on Sunday mornings at Moncloa. In 1900, conflict between members caused some of them to leave and create a new club, Nueva Sociedad de Football (New Society of Football), to distinguish themselves from Sky Football. Among the dissenters were Julián Palacios, recognized as the first Real Madrid president, Juan Padrós and Carlos Padrós, the latter two being brothers and future presidents of Real Madrid. In 1901, this new club was renamed as Madrid Football Club. Later, following a restructuring in 1902, Sky was renamed as \"New Foot-Ball Club\".[40][41][42] On 6 March 1902, after a new Board presided by Juan Padrós had been elected, Madrid Football Club was officially founded.[7] The Padrós brothers summoned other football enthusiasts to a meeting in the back room of Al Capricho, the family business. They viewed football as a mass sport that should be accessible to representatives of all social classes, and thought the new club should embody that idea. The brothers proposed the name, Madrid Football Club, which was unanimously accepted. The membership fee was also set, two pesetas a month, and the color of the shirt was chosen to be white in honour of a famous English team Corinthian, which Juan Padrós had met on one of his trips.[43][44] Three years after its founding, in 1905, Madrid FC won its first title after defeating Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Cup final. The club became one of the founding sides of the Royal Spanish Football Federation on 4 January 1909, when club president Adolfo Meléndez signed the foundation agreement of the Spanish FA. After moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912.[45] In 1920, the club's name was changed to Real Madrid after King Alfonso XIII granted the title of Real (Royal) to the club.[46] In 1929, the first Spanish football league was founded. Real Madrid led the first league season until the last match, a loss to Athletic Bilbao, meant they finished runners-up to Barcelona.[47] Real Madrid won its first league title in the 1931–32 season and retained it the following year.[48] On 14 April 1931, the arrival of the Second Spanish Republic caused the club to lose the title Real and the royal crown on its emblem, going back to being named Madrid Football Club until the end of the Spanish Civil War. Football continued during the Second World War, and on 13 June 1943, Madrid beat Barcelona 11–1 in the second leg of the Copa del Generalísimo semi-finals, the Spanish Cup having been renamed in honour of General Franco.[note 2][49] The first leg, played at the Les Corts in Catalonia, had ended with Barcelona winning 3–0. Madrid complained about all the three goals that referee Fombona Fernández had allowed for Barcelona,[50] with the home supporters also whistling Madrid throughout, whom they accused of employing roughhouse tactics, and Fombona for allowing them to. The newspaper Ya reported the whistling as a \"clear intention to attack the representatives of Spain.\"[51] Barcelona fans were banned from traveling to Madrid. The day of the second leg, the Barcelona team were insulted and stones were thrown at their bus as soon as they left their hotel. Barcelona's striker Mariano Gonzalvo said of the incident, \"Five minutes before the game had started, our penalty area was already full of coins.\" Barcelona goalkeeper Luis Miró rarely approached his line—when he did, he was armed with stones. As Francisco Calvet told the story, \"They were shouting: Reds! Separatists!... a bottle just missed Sospedra that would have killed him if it had hit him. It was all set up.\"[52] Real Madrid went 2–0 up within half an hour. The third goal brought with it a sending off for Barcelona's Benito García after he made what Calvet claimed was a \"completely normal tackle\". Madrid's José Llopis Corona recalled: \"At which point, they got a bit demoralized,\" while Ángel Mur countered, \"at which point, we thought: 'go on then, score as many as you want'.\"[53] Madrid made it 8–0 by half-time; two goals were also ruled out for offside, and proceeded to score a further three goals in the second half, to which Barcelona replied with a late consolation goal.[54] According to football writer Sid Lowe, \"There have been relatively few mentions of the game [since] and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid. Indeed, the 11–1 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelona's history. This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims.\"[50] Fernando Argila, Barcelona's reserve goalkeeper from the 1943 match, said: \"There was no rivalry. Not, at least, until that game.\"[55] Santiago Bernabéu became president of Real Madrid in 1943.[56] Under his presidency, the club was rebuilt after the Civil War, and he oversaw the construction of the club's current stadium, Estadio Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (now known as the Santiago Bernabéu), and its training facilities Ciudad Deportiva. Additionally, during the 1950s former Real Madrid Amateurs player Miguel Malbo founded Real Madrid's youth academy, or \"cantera,\" known today as La Fábrica. Beginning in 1953, he embarked upon a strategy of signing world-class players from abroad, the most prominent being Alfredo Di Stéfano.[57] In 1955, acting upon the idea proposed by Gabriel Hanot, a French sports journalist and editor of L'Équipe, Bernabéu, Ernest Bedrignan (deputy chairman of the Ligue de Football Professionnel)[58] and Gusztáv Sebes created the European Cup, a continental tournament for the league champions around Europe, which is today known as the UEFA Champions League.[59] It was under Bernabéu's guidance that Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football. The club won the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included the 7–3 Hampden Park final against Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960.[57] After these five consecutive successes, Real was permanently awarded the original cup and earned the right to wear the UEFA badge of honour.[60] Real Madrid's achievements in Europe were built upon its unprecedented domestic dominance, with the club winning twelve league titles out of sixteen possible from 1953–54 to 1968–69, including a five-in-a-row sequence in 1961–65, and finishing runners-up a further three times.[61] The club won the European Cup for a sixth time in 1966, defeating Partizan Belgrade 2–1 in the final with a team composed entirely of same nationality players, a first in the competition.[62] This team became known as the Yé-yé. The name \"Yé-yé\" came from the \"Yeah, yeah, yeah\" chorus in The Beatles' song \"She Loves You\" after four members of the team posed for Marca and impersonated the Beatles.[63] The Yé-yé generation was also European Cup runners-up in 1962[64] and 1964.[62] In the 1970s, Real Madrid won six league championships and three Spanish Cups.[65] The club competed in its first European Cup Winners' Cup in 1970–71 and progressed all the way to the final, where it lost to English side Chelsea 2–1 in a replay.[66] On 2 July 1978, club president Santiago Bernabéu died while the World Cup was being played in Argentina. FIFA decreed three days of mourning to honour him during the tournament.[67] The following year, the club organized the first edition of the Trofeo Santiago Bernabéu in memory of its former president. Bernabéu had been Real Madrid's president for almost 35 years, during which his club won one Intercontinental Cup, six European Cups, 16 league titles, six Spanish Cups, two Latin Cups and one Copa Eva Duarte.[68] In the early 1980s, Real Madrid had lost its grasp on the La Liga title, until a new cohort of home-grown stars brought domestic success back to the club.[69][70] Spanish sports journalist Julio César Iglesias gave to this generation the name La Quinta del Buitre (\"Vulture's Cohort\"), which was derived from the nickname given to one of its members, Emilio Butragueño. The other four members were Manolo Sanchís, Martín Vázquez, Míchel and Miguel Pardeza. All five footballers were graduates of Real Madrid's youth academy.[69][70] With La Quinta del Buitre (reduced to four members when Pardeza left for Zaragoza in 1986) and notable players like goalkeeper Francisco Buyo, right-back Miguel Porlán Chendo and Mexican striker Hugo Sánchez, Real Madrid had one of the best teams in Spain and Europe during the second half of the 1980s, winning two UEFA Cups, five Spanish championships in a row, one Spanish Cup, and three Spanish Super Cups.[69][70] In the early 1990s, La Quinta del Buitre split up after Martín Vázquez, Emilio Butragueño and Míchel left the club. In 1996, President Lorenzo Sanz appointed Fabio Capello as coach.[71] Although his tenure lasted only one season, Real Madrid were proclaimed league champions, and players like Predrag Mijatović, Davor Šuker, Clarence Seedorf, Roberto Carlos and keeper Bodo Illgner, arrived at the club to strengthen a squad that already boasted the likes of Raúl, Fernando Hierro and Fernando Redondo. As a result, Real Madrid (with the addition of Fernando Morientes in 1997) finally ended its 32-year wait for its seventh European Cup: in 1998, under manager Jupp Heynckes, they defeated Juventus 1–0 in the final with a goal from Mijatović.[72] In November 1999, Vicente del Bosque took over as coach. For the last season of the century, 1999–2000, the squad was still led by the older veterans such as Fernando Hierro, Fernando Redondo, Roberto Carlos and Raúl. Real added the budding young talents of Guti and Iker Casillas, supported by the arrival of Steve McManaman and Nicolas Anelka from the English Premier League, alongside local talents Míchel Salgado and Iván Helguera. In Del Bosque's first season in charge, Real won the Champions League for the eighth time, following a 3–0 victory over Valencia in the final, with goals from Morientes, McManaman and Raúl.[73] This victory marked the beginning of a successful period in Real Madrid's history.[74] In July 2000, Florentino Pérez was elected club president.[75] He vowed in his campaign to erase the club's €270 million debt and modernize the club's facilities. However, the primary electoral promise that propelled Pérez to victory was the signing of Luís Figo from arch-rivals Barcelona.[76] The following year, the club had its training ground rezoned and used the money to begin assembling the Galácticos team by signing a global star every summer, which included Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Luís Figo, David Beckham and Fabio Cannavaro.[77] It is debatable whether the gamble paid off, as despite winning the UEFA Champions League and an Intercontinental Cup in 2002, followed by La Liga in 2003, the club failed to win a major trophy for the next three seasons. Off the field, the Zidanes y Pavones policy resulted in increased financial success based on the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, particularly in Asia.[78] The few days after the capturing of the 2003 La Liga title were surrounded with controversy. The first controversial decision came when Pérez sacked winning coach Vicente del Bosque.[79] Over a dozen players left the club, including Madrid captain Fernando Hierro, while defensive midfielder Claude Makélélé refused to take part in training in protest at being one of the lowest-paid players at the club and subsequently moved to Chelsea.[80] \"That's a lot [of players leaving] when the normal rule is: never change a winning team,\" stated Zidane.[81] Real Madrid, with newly appointed coach Carlos Queiroz, started their domestic league slowly after a hard win over Real Betis.[81] The 2005–06 season began with the promise of several new signings: Júlio Baptista (€24 million), Robinho (€30 million), and Sergio Ramos (€27 million).[82] However, Real Madrid suffered from some poor results, including a 0–3 loss at the hands of Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu in November 2005.[83] Madrid's coach Wanderley Luxemburgo was sacked the following month and his replacement was Juan Ramón López Caro.[84] A brief return to form came to an abrupt halt after Madrid lost the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-finals 6–1 to Real Zaragoza,[85] a defeat that was nearly reversed with a 4–0 home victory. Shortly after, Real Madrid were eliminated from the Champions League for a fourth successive year, this time at the hands of Arsenal. On 27 February 2006, Florentino Pérez resigned.[86] Ramón Calderón was elected as club president on 2 July 2006 and subsequently appointed Fabio Capello as the new coach and Predrag Mijatović as the new sporting director. Real Madrid won the Liga title in 2007 for the first time in four years, but Capello was nonetheless sacked at the end of the campaign.[87] The title was won on 17 June, where Real faced Mallorca at the Bernabéu while Barcelona and Sevilla, the other title challengers, faced Gimnàstic de Tarragona and Villarreal, respectively. At half-time, Real were 0–1 down, while Barcelona had surged ahead into a 0–3 lead in Tarragona. However, three goals in the last half-hour secured Madrid a 3–1 win and their first league title since 2003.[88] Real Madrid repeated as league winners in 2007–08, but the following season ended up being one of the most disastrous in the club's history: Real was knocked out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage for the fifth time in a row, losing to Liverpool 0–5 on aggregate, and was embarrassed by Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu with a humiliating 2–6 loss, which all but confirmed the league title for Barça that went on to win the treble.[89] On 1 June 2009, Florentino Pérez regained Real Madrid's presidency amid the outrage over the club's decline.[90][91] Pérez continued with the Galácticos policy pursued in his first term, buying Kaká from Milan for a record-breaking (in pounds sterling) sum of £56 million,[92] and then breaking the record again by purchasing Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United for £80 million.[93] Real Madrid spent in excess of €261 million in the summer of 2009, and the assembled team was soon dubbed the Second Galácticos.[94] The 2009–10 season, however, was a transitional one as Madrid again finished second in the league, although this time amassing 96 points, the club's record at the time, and went out of the Champions League at the hands of Lyon. The season was marred by Cristiano Ronaldo's injury, that sidelined him for seven weeks,[95] although he still topped the goalscoring charts with 33 goals, and Madrid became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals. Real Madrid also had the misfortune to become the runners-up with the highest points total in the history of Europe's top five leagues, until surpassed by Liverpool's 97 points in 2018–19.[96][97] José Mourinho took over as manager in May 2010.[98][99] In the 2010–11 season, the rebuilt Madrid successfully fought on all fronts, going toe to toe with a brilliant Barcelona side which some regard as the greatest team in football history. Ultimately, Madrid finished second in the league, with 92 points and four behind their perennial rivals, defeated them in the Copa del Rey final, and lost to Barça in the Champions League semi-finals, where Real progressed to for the first time since 2002–03. Moreover, from 16 April through 3 May, a rare occurrence happened when, for the first time ever, four Clásicos were to be played in a span of just 18 days. The first fixture was in the league campaign on 16 April (which ended 1–1 with penalty goals for both sides), the second one was in the Copa del Rey final (which was won by Madrid 1–0 a.e.t., bringing them their first trophy in the second Galáctico era) on 20 April and the third and fourth ones in the controversial[100][101] two-legged Champions League semi-finals on 27 April and 3 May (Barcelona won on aggregate with a 2–0 away victory and a 1–1 home draw).[102] Madrid again became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals, repeating its output from the previous season, with Ronaldo scoring 40 and winning the European Golden Shoe. In the 2011–12 season, Real Madrid won La Liga for a record 32nd time in its history, also finishing the season with numerous league records set, including 100 points amassed in a single season, a total of 121 goals scored, a goal difference of +89, 16 away games won, and 32 wins overall.[103] They also competed in the UEFA Champions League for the 15th successive season,[104] losing in the semi-finals to Bayern Munich in a penalty shoot-out after a 3–3 aggregate tie. Madrid entered the Copa del Rey as the defending champions, but lost 3–4 on aggregate in the quarter-finals to Barcelona. In the same season, Cristiano Ronaldo became the fastest player to reach 100 goals scored in Spanish league history. In reaching 101 goals in 92 games, Ronaldo surpassed Real Madrid legend Ferenc Puskás, who scored 100 goals in 105 matches. Ronaldo set a new club mark for individual goals scored in one year (60) and became the first player ever to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single season.[105][106] Real Madrid started the 2012–13 season by winning the Supercopa de España, defeating Barcelona on away goals. However, the super cup turned out to be their only trophy of the season, despite being close to win them all. Real finished runners-up to Barça in La Liga, accumulating 85 points, and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League for the third year in a row, where they were eliminated by Borussia Dortmund 3–4 on aggregate. Madrid also entered the Copa del Rey in the round of 32, going on a memorable run to the final, which saw them defeat Barcelona in the semi-finals before losing to Atlético Madrid 1–2 a.e.t. Real Madrid faced the Blaugrana six times throughout the season, coming away with three wins, two draws, and one loss. A major transfer of the season was the signing of Luka Modrić from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in the region of £33 million.[107] After a loss to Atlético in the Copa del Rey final, Pérez announced the departure of José Mourinho at the end of the season by \"mutual agreement\".[108] On 25 June 2013, Carlo Ancelotti succeeded Mourinho to become the manager of Real Madrid on a three-year deal, with Zinedine Zidane named as one of his assistants.[109] On 1 September 2013, the long-awaited transfer of Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur was announced. The transfer of the Welshman was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer price approximated at €100 million.[110] In Ancelotti's first season at the club, Real Madrid fought on all three fronts for the continental treble. Despite leading in the league campaign on multiple occasions, Madrid ultimately finished in third place (level on points with Barcelona and three behind cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid), collecting 87 points in total and scoring a record 104 goals.[111] By that time, Los Blancos had already secured the Copa del Rey – against rivals Barcelona – in April, with Bale scoring the winner.[112] The major breakthrough came in the UEFA Champions League, where Real returned to the final after twelve years, having beaten defending champions Bayern Munich 5–0 on aggregate in the semi-finals.[113] In the final, they defeated then-recently-league winners Atlético Madrid 4–1 a.e.t. to clinch their tenth European Cup (first since 2002) and become the first team to win ten European Cups/Champions League titles, an achievement known as \"La Décima\" (Spanish: \"The Tenth,\" [la ˈðeθima]).[114] Real's attacking trio of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, dubbed the BBC, finished the season with 97 goals.[115] After winning the 2014 Champions League, Real Madrid signed goalkeeper Keylor Navas, midfielder Toni Kroos and attacking midfielder James Rodríguez.[116] In August, Madrid won the 2014 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, the club's 79th official trophy.[117] During the last week of the 2014 summer transfer window, Real Madrid sold two players key to the previous season's successes: Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich and Ángel Di María to Manchester United. This decision by the club was surrounded by controversy, with Cristiano Ronaldo stating, \"If I was in charge, maybe I would have done things differently,\" while Carlo Ancelotti admitted, \"We must start again from zero.\"[118] After a slow start to the 2014–15 season, Real Madrid went on a record-breaking 22-match winning streak, which included wins against Barcelona and Liverpool, surpassing the previous Spanish record of 18 successive wins set by Frank Rijkaard's Barça in the 2005–06 season.[119] In late December, Real Madrid won their first Club World Cup, defeating San Lorenzo 2–0 in the final.[120] The winning streak came to an end in their opening match of 2015 with a loss to Valencia, leaving the club two short of equalling the world record of 24 consecutive wins.[121] Madrid was in contention for both the La Liga title and the UEFA Champions League until the very end but ultimately came up short, finishing with 92 points in the league, two behind treble-winning Barcelona and losing to Juventus 2–3 on aggregate in the Champions League semi-finals.[122] Ronaldo finished the season scoring 48 league goals, winning his fourth European Golden Shoe, and 61 goals in all competitions, breaking his record from 2011 to 2012.[123] Overall, despite playing an attractive attacking football and being the highest scoring team in Europe with 118 league goals,[124] several narrow defeats meant that Real finished the season with two trophies out of six possible, which contributed to the dismissal of Carlo Ancelotti on 25 May 2015.[125][126] On 3 June 2015, Rafael Benítez was confirmed as the new Real Madrid manager for the 2015–16 season, signing a three-year contract.[127] Real Madrid remained unbeaten in the league until a 3–2 loss at Sevilla on the matchday 11. This was followed by a 0–4 home loss in the first Clásico of the season against Barcelona. Perhaps, his reign is best remembered by multiple lopsided wins achieved both in La Liga and the Champions League (6–0 vs Espanyol, 8–0 vs Malmö, 10–2 vs Rayo Vallecano and others). In the Copa del Rey round of 32, Real accidentally fielded an ineligible player in a 3–1 first leg win at Cádiz and was disqualified from the tournament two days later by the competition judge, despite protests from president Pérez.[128][129][130] In the meantime, Madrid comfortably topped their UCL group with 16 points and a +16 goal difference. Benítez was relieved of his duties on 4 January 2016 following allegations of unpopularity with supporters, displeasure with players and a failure to get good results against top teams.[131] Benítez's departure was announced along with the promotion of Zinedine Zidane to his first head coaching role.[132] Under Zidane, Madrid managed to turn the odds in its favour, ultimately winning the Champions League, something no one expected. The notable results include a 2–1 away victory over reigning treble winners Barcelona, who were on a record-breaking winning streak, a fantastic comeback against Wolfsburg in the Champions League quarter-finals (after losing the away game 0–2, Madrid erased the deficit and won 3–0 at home, courtesy of a Cristiano Ronaldo hat-trick), as well as a 12-game winning streak to conclude the league campaign, meaning Real finished second, with 90 points and just one point behind champions Barcelona, coming agonizingly close to clinching the title and overcoming a 12-point deficit in the process.[133] Finally, on 28 May, Real Madrid's eleventh Champions League title was won thanks to a 5–3 penalty shoot-out victory over rivals Atlético Madrid after a 1–1 draw in the final, with the achievement being termed \"La Undécima\".[134][135][126] Real Madrid began their 2016–17 campaign, which was to be Zidane's first full season in charge of the club, with a victory in the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla.[136] On 10 December 2016, Madrid played their 35th-straight match without a loss, which set a new club record.[137] On 18 December 2016, the club defeated Japanese outfit Kashima Antlers 4–2 in the final of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup.[138] With a 3–3 draw at Sevilla in the second leg of the Copa del Rey round of 16 on 12 January 2017, Madrid progressed to the quarter-finals with a 6–3 aggregate victory and extended its unbeaten run to 40 matches, breaking Barcelona's Spanish record of 39 matches unbeaten in all competitions from the previous season.[139] Their unbeaten streak ended after a 1–2 away loss against the same opposition in La Liga three days later.[140] The team then was knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Celta Vigo 3–4 on aggregate. These slips, however, did not affect the overall trajectory of the season. In May, Madrid won the league title for a record 33rd time, their first title in five years, accumulating 93 points in the process.[141] On 3 June 2017, the club's victory over Juventus in the Champions League final resulted in Real Madrid becoming the first team to successfully defend their title in the UEFA Champions League era, and the first to win consecutive titles in the competition since Milan in 1989 and 1990, when the tournament was known as the European Cup.[142][143] Real Madrid's title was its 12th, extending the record, and its third in four years. The achievement is also known as \"La Duodécima\".[144] The 2016–17 season was the greatest campaign in terms of trophies won (four out of possible five) in the history of Real Madrid, an achievement that would be later equalled in the 2017–18 season.[145] Real kicked off the 2017–18 campaign by winning its second consecutive and fourth overall UEFA Super Cup in a 2–1 victory against Manchester United.[146] Five days later, Real Madrid beat Barcelona at the Camp Nou 3–1 in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de España and then defeated Barça 2–0 in the return leg, ending their 24 consecutive match scoring record in El Clásico matches and winning the second trophy of the season.[147] On 16 December 2017, Real beat Brazilian club Grêmio 1–0 in the FIFA Club World Cup final and became the first team to retain the trophy.[148] In the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, Madrid once again progressed to the final where they defeated Liverpool 3–1 to become the first club to win three straight titles in the Champions League era, as well as the first team to win three consecutive titles in the European Cup/Champions League since Bayern Munich in 1976. The trophy also marked Madrid's fourth win in five years and their eighth consecutive semi-finals appearance. On 31 May, only five days after winning the final, Zidane announced his resignation as Real Madrid manager, citing the club's \"need for change\" as his rationale for departing.[149][150] Zidane's and Ronaldo's departures marked the end of the Second Galáctico Era that yielded four Champions League titles, two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey, two Supercopa de España, three UEFA Super Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cup titles. The team was instrumental in ending Barcelona's dominance, despite the Blaugrana boasting arguably the greatest collection of talent in history,[151] and overshadowed the Catalans on the European stage.[152] Real Madrid was also somewhat notoriously unlucky in its league campaigns throughout these nine years, finishing runners-up with 96, 92 (twice) and 90 points, as well as on 87 points in third place, just three off the league winners.[97] On 12 June 2018, Real Madrid named Julen Lopetegui, the head coach of the Spanish national team, as their new manager. It was announced that he would officially begin his managerial duties after the 2018 FIFA World Cup. However, the Spanish national team sacked Lopetegui a day prior to the tournament, stating that he had negotiated terms with the club without informing them.[153][154] The club then began re-shaping the squad in the summer of 2018, which included the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus for a reported €117 million.[155] Madrid began their 2018–19 campaign by losing to Atlético Madrid 2–4 a.e.t. in the 2018 UEFA Super Cup. After a 1–5 loss to Barcelona in El Clásico on 28 October which left Real Madrid in the ninth place with only 14 points after ten games, Lopetegui was dismissed a day later and replaced by then Castilla coach, Santiago Solari.[156] On 22 December 2018, Real Madrid beat Al Ain 4–1 in the FIFA Club World Cup and became the outright record winners of the Club World Cup with four titles.[157] However, they were then knocked out of the Copa del Rey at the semi-final stage by Barcelona, losing 1–4 on aggregate. On 5 March 2019, Real was defeated by Ajax 1–4 (3–5 on aggregate) at home, crashing out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage after eight consecutive semi-finals appearances. On 11 March 2019, Real Madrid dismissed Solari and reinstated Zidane as the head coach of the club.[158] Madrid finished the season with 68 points and a +17 goal difference, its lowest totals since 2001–02 and 1999–2000 respectively.[159] In the summer of 2019, Madrid signed Eden Hazard, Luka Jović, Éder Militão, Ferland Mendy, Rodrygo, Reinier and other players for a total of more than €350 million.[160] On 12 January 2020, Madrid beat cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid in a penalty shootout in the Supercopa de España final to win their eleventh title.[161] After a three-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, La Liga was restarted in June and Madrid won ten games in a row to capture the team's 34th league title, collecting 87 points in total.[162] From the competition's resumption in June and until the end of the 2020–21 season, Real temporarily played home fixtures at the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium, while the Santiago Bernabéu underwent extensive renovations.[163][164] Zidane left a second time on 27 May 2021 after going trophyless that season,[165] with Carlo Ancelotti returning to coach the team for the 2021–22 season.[166] On the domestic front, he delivered two trophies out of possible three, winning La Liga and the Supercopa de España.[167][168][169] As such, Ancelotti won all six available top trophies at Madrid.[170] In the Champions League, Madrid produced one of the most memorable runs of all time,[171] defeating pre-tournament favourites Paris Saint-Germain,[172][173] defending champions and favourites Chelsea,[174] Premier League champions and heavy favourites Manchester City,[175] all in dramatic fashion,[176] and setting up the final against Liverpool, who were once again widely considered as favourites,[177] in a rematch of their 2018 encounter. A lone Vinícius Júnior goal sealed the 14th European Cup for Los Blancos, their fifth in nine years, and Ancelotti's second in charge.[178][179] Real also claimed their fourth ever European double (after 1956–57, 1957–58, and 2016–17). Despite Real's status as the most decorated team in the history of the Champions League, they were not favoured to win that year's edition, and their improbable run was widely considered a surprise.[180] After a highly successful 2021–22 season, Real Madrid signed German defender Antonio Rüdiger and French midfielder Aurélien Tchouaméni, while club legends Marcelo, Isco, Gareth Bale and Casemiro left the club. Real Madrid's 2022–23 season began with lifting the UEFA Super Cup and later the FIFA Club World Cup. The season ended with Real Madrid winning the 2022–23 Copa del Rey, but losing the La Liga and Spanish Super Cup to FC Barcelona and the Champions League to Manchester City, being defeated 5–1 on aggregate. In 2023, Real Madrid signed Jude Bellingham, who was given the number #5 jersey, previously used by Zinedine Zidane. Real also signed Arda Güler and Fran García. Meanwhile, Vinícius Júnior was given the number #7 jersey, previously used by Raúl and Cristiano Ronaldo; while Rodrygo was given the number #11 jersey, previously used by Gareth Bale. Karim Benzema left the club, while Toni Kroos would later announce that he would retire from football after this season. The 2023-24 season would prove to be another highly successful season for Los Blancos. First, Real Madrid lifted the Spanish Super Cup against Barcelona 4–1, taking revenge of the previous year's 3–0 defeat. Then, Real Madrid lifted the La Liga with relative ease, reaching 95 points, the second-best winning campaign by Real Madrid in La Liga history after the 2011–12 100 points season. In the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League, Real Madrid knocked out RB Leipzig in the Round of 16, then defending champions Manchester City in penalties. In the semifinals, Real Madrid faced Bayern Munich again. The first match was a 2–2 draw, while the second match in the Bernabéu was marked by a double by Joselu in the last few minutes of the game, with Bayern Munich suffering a historic comeback after leading 1–0. Real Madrid faced Borussia Dortmund in the final, and won 2–0, with Dani Carvajal being the man of the match and scoring with a header after a Toni Kroos corner, and Vinícius Júnior once again scoring in a UCL final. Real Madrid won their 15th Champions League without losing a single match during the campaign. Following the conclusion of the 2023–24 season, Real Madrid announced that striker Kylian Mbappé would be joining the club on a free transfer from Paris Saint-Germain in July 2024, concluding one of the most highly anticipated transfer sagas in modern history.[181] The first crest had a simple design consisting of a decorative interlacing of the three initials of the club, \"MCF\" for Madrid Club de Fútbol, in dark blue on a white shirt. The first change in the crest occurred in 1908 when the letters adopted a more streamlined form and appeared inside a circle.[182] The next change in the configuration of the crest did not occur until the presidency of Pedro Parages in 1920. At that time, King Alfonso XIII granted the club his royal patronage which came in the form of the title \"Real Madrid,\" meaning \"Royal.\"[183] Thus, Alfonso's crown was added to the crest and the club styled itself Real Madrid Club de Fútbol.[182] With the dissolution of the monarchy in 1931, all royal symbols (the crown on the crest and the title of Real) were eliminated. The crown was replaced by the dark mulberry band of the Region of Castile.[48] In 1941, two years after Nationalist victory in the Civil War, the Francoist regime restored the crest's \"Real Corona\", or \"Royal Crown\", while the mulberry stripe of Castile was retained as well.[184][56] In addition, the whole crest was made full color, with gold being the most prominent, and the club went back to its honorific name Real Madrid Club de Fútbol.[182] The most recent modification to the crest occurred in 2001 when the club wanted to better situate itself for the 21st century and further standardize its crest. One of the modifications made was changing the mulberry stripe to a more bluish shade.[182] Real Madrid has maintained the white shirt for its home kit throughout the history of the club. There was, however, one season that the shirt and shorts were not both white. It was an initiative undertaken by Juan Padrós in honour of an English team Corinthian, which he had met on one of his trips, one of the most famous teams at the time known for its elegance and sportsmanship.[43] It was decided that Real Madrid would wear black shorts in an attempt to replicate the English team, which had also inspired Madrid's original white kit, but the initiative lasted just one year. After being eliminated from the cup by Barcelona with a 1–5 defeat in Madrid and a 2–0 defeat in Catalonia, President Parages decided to return to an all-white kit, claiming that the other kit brought bad luck.[note 3] By the early 1940s, the manager changed the kit again by adding buttons to the shirt and the club's crest on the left breast, which has remained ever since. On 23 November 1947, in a game against Atlético Madrid at the Metropolitano Stadium, Real Madrid became the first Spanish team to wear numbered shirts.[56] English club Leeds United permanently switched their blue shirt for a white one in the 1960s, to emulate the dominant Real Madrid of the era.[185] Real's traditional away colours are all blue or all purple. Since the advent of the replica kit market, the club has also released various other one colour designs, including red, green, orange and black. The club's kit is manufactured by Adidas, whose contract extends from 1998.[186][187] Real Madrid's first shirt sponsor, Zanussi, agreed for the 1982–83, 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons. Following that, the club was sponsored by Parmalat and Otaysa before a long-term deal was signed with Teka in 1992.[188][189] In 2001, Real Madrid ended their contract with Teka and for one season and used the Realmadrid.com logo to promote the club's website. Then, in 2002, a deal was signed with Siemens and in 2006, the BenQ Siemens logo appeared on the club's shirt.[190] Real Madrid's shirt sponsor from 2007 until 2013 was bwin.com following the economic problems of BenQ Siemens.[191][192] Fly Emirates became their shirt sponsor in 2013, and in 2017 the club renewed the sponsorship with the airliner, signing a deal until 2022 worth €70 million per year.[193] In 2022, the agreement was again extended, until 2026.[194] In 2015, Madrid signed a new ten-year contract with Adidas, believed to be worth a total of £850 million (€1 billion), with the club earning £59 million (€64 million) per season. The contract includes a clause sanctioning penalty or agreement termination anytime, if Real Madrid fails to qualify for the European competitions or is relegated from La Liga.[195] Note: early termination clauses can be activated at any time depending on the team's performance. After moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912, which remained its home stadium for 11 years.[45] After this period, the club moved for one year to the Campo de Ciudad Lineal, a small ground with a capacity of 8,000 spectators. After that, Real Madrid started playing its home matches at the Estadio Chamartín, which was inaugurated on 17 May 1923 with a match against Newcastle United.[201] In this stadium, which hosted 22,500 spectators, Real Madrid celebrated its first Spanish league title.[47] Following his election in 1943, president Santiago Bernabéu decided that the Chamartín was not big enough for the ambitions of the club, and thus a new stadium was built and inaugurated on 14 December 1947.[56][202] Initially knows as Nuevo Chamartín, the stadium was renamed in honour of Bernabéu in 1955 and continues to bear his name to this day.[57] The first match at the Bernabéu was played between Madrid and the Portuguese club Belenenses, with Los Blancos winning 3–1 and Sabino Barinaga scoring the first goal.[56] The capacity has changed frequently, peaking at 120,000 after a 1953 expansion.[203] Since then, there have been a number of reductions due to modernizations (the last standing areas were removed in 1998–99 in response to UEFA regulations which had forbidden standing at matches in European competitions), countered to some extent by expansions.[203] The current capacity is 81,044 spectators. Real Madrid has the fourth-highest average attendance in Europe, behind Borussia Dortmund, Barcelona and Manchester United.[204][205][206][207] The Bernabéu has hosted the 1964 UEFA European Championship final, the 1982 FIFA World Cup final, and the 1957, 1969, 1980 and 2010 European Cup/Champions League finals.[208] The stadium has its own namesake Madrid Metro station along the 10 line.[209] On 14 November 2007, the Bernabéu was upgraded to Elite Football Stadium status by UEFA.[210] On 9 May 2006, the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium, named after club legend Alfredo Di Stéfano, was inaugurated in the Real Madrid City, where Real Madrid usually trains. The inaugural match was played between Real Madrid and Reims, a rematch of the 1956 European Cup final. Real Madrid 6–1, with goals from Sergio Ramos, Antonio Cassano (2), Roberto Soldado (2) and José Manuel Jurado. The venue is now part of the Ciudad Real Madrid, the club's training facility located outside Madrid, in Valdebebas. The stadium's capacity is 5,000 people, and it is Real Madrid Castilla's home ground.[211] For the latter part of the 2019–20 season and throughout the 2020–21 season, the stadium hosted the first team's home games due to a combination of the COVID-19 pandemic-triggered restrictions and an extensive renovation of the Santiago Bernabéu.[212][164] The latest renovation of the Santiago Bernabéu is set to increase the capacity by approximately 4,000 with the addition of an extra tier, bringing it to nearly 85,000.[213][214] Furthermore, the height will also be increased by ten metres and a retractable roof, a retractable pitch and a 360-degree screen will be installed.[215][216] The works have started in 2019, and the renovated stadium was initially planned to be unveiled in 2022; however, the COVID-19 pandemic and Russian invasion of Ukraine caused significant disruption to supply chains, prompting the club to postpone the stadium's inauguration to 2023.[217][218] Raúl holds the record for most appearances with Real Madrid, with 741 appearances from 1994 to 2010. Iker Casillas comes second with 725 appearances, followed by Manuel Sanchis Jr., having played 710 times.[219] The record for a goalkeeper is held by Iker Casillas, with 725 appearances. With 63 goals, Cristiano Ronaldo has scored the most international goals while playing for the club. Meanwhile, Sergio Ramos has accumulated the most caps while playing for the club, with 176. Cristiano Ronaldo (2009–2018) is Real Madrid's all-time top goalscorer, with 450 goals in 438 matches.[220][221] Six other players have also scored over 200 goals for Real: Alfredo Di Stéfano (1953–1964), Santillana (1971–1988), Ferenc Puskás (1958–1966), Hugo Sánchez (1985–1992), Karim Benzema (2009–2023) and the previous goalscoring record-holder Raúl (1994–2010). Cristiano Ronaldo also holds the record for the most league goals scored in one season (48 in 2014–15), alongside being Real's top goalscorer of all time in La Liga history with 311 goals. Di Stéfano's 49 goals in 58 matches was for decades the all-time highest tally in the European Cup, until it was surpassed by Raúl in 2005, and is now held by Cristiano Ronaldo with 105 goals for Madrid and 140 overall. The fastest goal in the history of the club (13 seconds) was scored by the Chilean Iván Zamorano on 3 September 1994 during a league match against Sevilla.[222] Officially, the highest home attendance figure for a Real Madrid match is 129,690, which was for a European Cup match in 1956 against Milan. The current official capacity of the Santiago Bernabéu is 80,000.[223] Real has also set records in Spanish football, most notably the most domestic titles (36 as of 2023–24) and the most seasons won in a row (five, during 1960–65 and 1985–90).[1] With 121 matches (from 17 February 1957 to 7 March 1965), the club holds the record for longest unbeaten run at home in La Liga.[224] The club also holds the record for winning the European Cup/UEFA Champions League fifteen times[225] and for the most semi-finals appearances (33). As of June 2024, Cristiano Ronaldo is the all-time top scorer in the UEFA Champions League, with 140 (141 including qualifiers) goals in total, 105 while playing for Real Madrid. The team has the record number of consecutive participations in the European Cup (before it became the Champions League) with 15, from 1955–56 to 1969–70.[226] Among the club's on-field records is a 22-game winning streak in all competitions during the 2014–15 season, a Spanish record. In September 2017, the club equalled the record of the Brazilian club Santos, starring Pelé, by scoring in their 73rd consecutive game, before Bayern Munich breaks the record in 2021.[227] In June 2009, the club broke its own record for the highest transfer fee ever paid in the history of football after purchasing Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo for €94 million (£80 million).[228][229] The fee of €77.5 million (100 billion lire) for Zinedine Zidane's transfer from Juventus to Real Madrid in 2001 was the previous highest transfer fee ever paid. This record (in pounds sterling) had been broken previously in June 2009, for a few days, when Real Madrid agreed to buy Kaká from Milan for €67 million (£65 million). The transfer of Tottenham Hotspur's Gareth Bale in 2013 was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer fee approximated at around €100 million.[110] In January 2016, documents pertaining to Bale's transfer were leaked which confirmed a world record transfer fee of €100,759,418.[230] Real Madrid equalled their record signing in 2019, when the club signed Eden Hazard from Chelsea for a reported €115 million.[231] The club's record sale occurred on 10 July 2018, when Juventus signed Cristiano Ronaldo for €117 million.[232] During most home matches, the majority of the seats in the stadium are occupied by season-ticket holders, of which the figure is capped at 65,000.[233] To become a season ticket holder one must first be a socio, or club member. In addition to members, the club has more than 1,800 peñas (official, club-affiliated supporters' groups) in Spain and around the world. Real Madrid has the second highest average all-time attendance in Spanish football and regularly attracts over 74,000 fans to the Bernabéu. One of the best supported teams globally, Real Madrid was the first sports team (and first brand) to reach 100 million fans on Facebook in April 2017.[234][235] Real Madrid's hardcore supporters are the so-called Ultras Sur supporters, or simply Ultras. They are known for their extreme right-wing politics, akin to Barcelona's hardcore supporters group Boixos Nois. The Ultras Surs have developed an alliance with other right wing groups, most notably Lazio Irriducibili fans, and have also developed an alliance with left-wing groups. On several occasions, they have racially abused opposing players, and have been investigated by UEFA for doing so.[236][237] Florentino Pérez took it upon himself to ban the Ultras from the Bernabéu and assign their seats to the general public. This decision was controversial with some of the Bernabéu faithful, however, as the lively atmosphere of games would suffer as a result.[238][239] The Ultras have since held protests outside the Bernabéu and have demanded to be reinstated and allowed to enter the grounds.[240] Questioned over Pope Francis' adherence to 2014 FIFA Club World Cup Final opponents San Lorenzo, Madrid captain Sergio Ramos stated: \"In the semi-finals we noticed the love from supporters in Marrakesh and it seemed like we were playing at home. That sums up the greatness of this team. Madrid is God's team and the team of the world\".[241] Among the club's famous supporters is golfer Sergio García, who was invited to take the honorary kickoff for El Clásico at the Bernabeu wearing his green jacket from winning the 2017 Masters.[242] There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Real Madrid and Barcelona is known as \"The Classic\" (El Clásico). From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Castile and Catalonia, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between the Castilians and Catalans, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.[243] Over the years, the record for Real Madrid and Barcelona is 100 victories for Madrid, 97 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws.[244] As early as the 1930s, Barcelona \"had developed a reputation as a symbol of Catalan identity, opposed to the centralising tendencies of Madrid\".[246][247] During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera and especially Francisco Franco, all regional languages and identities in Spain were frowned upon and restrained. As such, most citizens of Barcelona were in strong opposition to Franco's regime. In that period, Barcelona gained their motto Més que un club (English: More than a club) because of its alleged connection to Catalan nationalist as well as to progressive beliefs.[248] There is an ongoing controversy as to what extent Franco's rule (1939–75) influenced the activities and on-pitch results of both Barcelona and Real Madrid. Fans of both clubs tend to exaggerate the myths favouring their narratives. Most historians agree that Franco did not have a preferred football team, but his Spanish nationalist beliefs led him to associate himself with the establishment teams, such as Atlético Aviación and Madrid FC (that recovered its \"royal\" name after the fall of the Republic and again became Real Madrid). On the other hand, he also wanted the renamed Barcelona succeed as \"Spanish team\", rather than a Catalan one. During the early years of Franco's rule, Real Madrid were not particularly successful, winning two Copa del Generalísimo titles and a Copa Eva Duarte; Barcelona claimed three league titles, one Copa del Generalísimo and one Copa Eva Duarte. During that period, Atlético Aviación were believed to be the preferred team over Real Madrid. The most contested stories of the period include Real Madrid's 11–1 home win against Barcelona in the Copa del Generalísimo, where the Catalan team alleged intimidation, and the controversial transfer of Alfredo Di Stéfano to Real Madrid, despite his agreement with Barcelona. The latter transfer was part of Real Madrid chairman Santiago Bernabéu's \"revolution\" that ushered in the era of unprecedented dominance. Bernabéu, himself a veteran of the Civil War who fought for Franco's forces, saw Real Madrid on top, not only of Spanish, but also European football, helping create the European Cup, the first true competition for Europe's best club sides. His vision was fulfilled when Real Madrid not only started winning consecutive league titles, but also swept the first five editions of the European Cup in the 1950s.[249] These events had a profound impact on Spanish football and influenced Franco's attitude. According to historians, during this time he realized the importance of Real Madrid for his regime's international image, and the club became his preferred team until his death. Fernando Maria Castiella, who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs under Franco from 1957 until 1969, noted that \"[Real Madrid] is the best embassy we have ever had\". Franco died in 1975, and the Spanish transition to democracy soon followed. Under his rule, Real Madrid had won 14 league titles, six Copa del Generalísimo titles, one Copa Eva Duarte, six European Cups, two Latin Cups and one Intercontinental Cup. In the same period, Barcelona had won eight league titles, nine Copa del Generalísimo titles, three Copa Eva Duarte titles, three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups and two Latin Cups.[250][184] The rivalry was intensified during the 1950s when the clubs disputed the signing of Alfredo Di Stéfano. Di Stéfano had impressed both Barcelona and Real Madrid while playing for Los Millonarios in Bogotá, Colombia, during a players' strike in his native Argentina. Soon after Millonarios' return to Colombia, Barcelona directors visited Buenos Aires and agreed with River Plate, the last FIFA-affiliated team to have held Di Stéfano's rights, for his transfer in 1954 for the equivalent of 150 million Italian lira (according to other sources 200,000 dollars). This started a battle between the two Spanish rivals for his rights. FIFA appointed Armando Muñoz Calero, former president of the Spanish Football Federation as mediator. Calero decided to let Di Stéfano play the 1953–54 and 1955–56 seasons in Madrid, and the 1954–55 and 1956–57 seasons in Barcelona. The agreement was approved by the Football Association and their respective clubs. Although the Catalans agreed, the decision created various discontent among the Blaugrana members and the president was forced to resign in September 1953. Barcelona sold Madrid their half-share, and Di Stéfano moved to Los Blancos, signing a four-year contract. Real paid 5.5 million Spanish pesetas for the transfer, plus a 1.3 million bonus for the purchase, an annual fee to be paid to the Millonarios, and a 16,000 salary for Di Stéfano with a bonus double that of his teammates, for a total of 40% of the annual revenue of the Madrid club.[251] Di Stéfano became integral in the subsequent success achieved by Real Madrid, scoring twice in his first game against Barcelona. With him, Madrid won the first five editions of the European Cup.[252] The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when Real Madrid and Barcelona met twice in the European Cup, with Madrid triumphing en route to their fifth consecutive title in 1959–60 and Barcelona prevailing en route to losing the final in 1960–61. Ahead of the 1973–74 season, Johan Cruyff arrived to Barcelona for a world record £920,000 from Ajax.[253] Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Francisco Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son \"Jordi\", after the local Catalan Saint George.[254] In 2002, the European encounter between the clubs was dubbed the \"Match of The Century\" by Spanish media, and Madrid's win was watched by more than 500 million people around the world.[255] A fixture known for its intensity and indiscipline, it has also featured memorable goal celebrations from both teams, often involving mocking the opposition.[256] In October 1999, Real Madrid forward Raúl silenced 100,000 Barcelona fans at the Camp Nou when he scored before he celebrated by putting a finger to his lips as if telling the crowd to be quiet.[256][257] In 2009, Barcelona captain Carles Puyol kissed his Catalan armband in front of Madrid fans at the Bernabéu.[256] Cristiano Ronaldo twice gestured to the hostile crowd to \"calm down\" after scoring against Barcelona at the Camp Nou in 2012 and 2016.[256] In April 2017, Messi celebrated his 93rd-minute winner for Barcelona against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu by taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans – with his name and number facing them.[256] Later that year, in August, Ronaldo was subbed on in the first leg of the Supercopa de España, proceeded to score in the 80th minute and took his shirt off before holding it up to Barça's fans with his name and number facing them.[258] The club's nearest neighbour is Atlético Madrid, a rivalry being shared between fans of both football teams. Although Atlético was founded by three Basque students in 1903, it was joined in 1904 by dissident members of \"Madrid FC\". The two teams met for the first time on 2 December 1906 in the regional championship, with Real Madrid winning 2–1. Their first league meeting came on 21 February 1929 in matchday three of the first league championship at the former Chamartín. It was the first official derby of the new tournament, and Real won 2–1.[47] After the Civil War, during the early Francoist period, Atlético became associated with the military air force (and thus renamed Atlético Aviación), although the alleged preference of the regime for the club is subject to discussion. In any case, during this period Atlético became the most successful club in Spain, reducing the historical gap between the two clubs, until the regime preference shifted towards Real Madrid in the 1950s, as Franco sought to make political capital out of Real Madrid's multiple European Cup titles at a time when Spain was internationally isolated; one minister said, \"Real Madrid are the best ambassadors we've ever had.\"[184] Thus, Atlético fans regularly chanted that Real were \"El equipo del gobierno, la vergüenza del país\" – \"The team of the government, the shame of the country\" – and allegedly adopted a more left-wing slant (tempered by the rise of ultras culture and Rayo Vallecano's presence as the \"true\" leftist club in Madrid).[259][260] The rivalry first gained international attention in 1959 during the European Cup when the two clubs met in the semi-finals. Real won the first leg 2–1 at the Santiago Bernabéu, while Atlético won 1–0 at the Metropolitano. The tie went to a replay, which Real won 2–1. Atlético, however, gained some revenge when, led by former Real Madrid coach José Villalonga, it defeated its city rivals in two successive Copa del Generalísimo finals in 1960 and 1961.[261] In the 1970s, Atlético again took the lead as the most successful Spanish club of the decade, which prompted the Real Madrid fanbase to look down on Atlético calling them and their supporters \"Indios\" (Indians, a reference to the Latin American players signed by the Red-and-whites).[262] By then, Real Madrid did not want to sign non-Caucasian players (president Santiago Bernabéu even stated, when he decided not to sign Portuguese star Eusebio at the end of the 1960s, \"Mientras yo viva, aquí no jugará ningún negro ni un blanco con bigote\" (\"As long as I live, no black or white with a mustache will play here\").[263] Atlético's supporters accepted the new \"Indian\" nickname joyfully and have been using it until today. The Santiago Bernabéu, Real Madrid's stadium, is alongside banks and businesses on the upper class Paseo de la Castellana street, while the Vicente Calderón (the stadium that Atlético Madrid used until the 2016–17 season) could be found near a brewery, alongside the Manzanares River and a motorway. Real draw greater support all across the region because of their historically greater resources and success, while Atlético have a relatively working class fan base mainly from the south of the city, with some fans also scattered throughout the city.[264][265] In fact, the Atlético crest includes the Coat of arms of Madrid, whereas Real crest has no such a reference to the city (instead, it includes a reference to the broader Castile region). Between 1961 and 1989, when Real dominated La Liga, only Atlético offered it any serious challenge, winning league titles in 1966, 1970, 1973 and 1977. In 1965, Atlético became the first team to beat Real at the Bernabéu in eight years. Real Madrid's record against Atlético in more recent times is very favourable.[266] A high point came in the 2002–03 season, when Real clinched the La Liga title after a 4–0 victory at the Vicente Calderón. Atlético's first win over its city rivals since 1999 came in the Copa del Rey final in May 2013. In 2013–14, Real and Atlético were finalists of the UEFA Champions League, the first final which hosted two clubs from the same city. Real Madrid triumphed with a 4–1 comeback victory in extra time.[267] On 7 February 2015, Real suffered their first defeat in 14 years at the Vicente Calderón, a 4–0 loss.[268] On 28 May 2016, Real and Atlético again met for the Champions League title, which resulted in a win for Real after a penalty shootout at San Siro.[269] A further minor rivalry exists between Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao. This is known as El Viejo Clásico (the old classic),[270] so named as the two clubs were dominant in the first half of the 20th century, meeting in nine Copa del Rey finals including the first in 1903.[271][272] Until 10 December 2011, this fixture was the most played in the history of Spanish football, when it was surpassed by El Clásico.[273] Athletic Bilbao, who operate a policy of only using local players,[274] have long since ceased to be a competitive rival to clubs such as Real Madrid who scour the globe for the best talent; the Lions won only two of the 26 matches between the teams from 2005–06 to 2016–17.[270][275][276] However, the matches remain keenly fought due to their historical and cultural significance, with some parallels to the political aspect of the Barcelona/Catalonia rivalry as Athletic are the largest club in the Basque region.[277][260][278] Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are two of the most successful clubs in the UEFA Champions League/European Cup competition, with Real winning 15 times and Bayern winning six times.[279][280] Although they have never met in a final, Real Madrid versus Bayern is the match that has historically been played most often in the Champions League/European Cup with 26 matches (twelve wins for Madrid, eleven wins for Bayern, with three draws),[281] with several controversial incidents occurring due to the great importance of most of their meetings.[282][283][284] Real Madrid supporters often refer to Bayern as the \"Bestia negra\" (\"Black Beast\"). During the 2010s, the two teams met in the 2011–12 Champions League semi-finals, which ended 3–3 on aggregate (Bayern won 3–1 on penalties after extra time, but lost the final at their own stadium by the same method), then at the same stage in the 2013–14 edition with Real Madrid winning 5–0 on aggregate,[285] and again in 2017–18 with the Spanish club progressing 4–3;[286] both times they went on to win the competition. Another match that is often played in the European Cup/Champions League is Real Madrid vs Juventus, the most decorated Italian club. They have played each other in 21 matches and have an almost perfectly balanced record (nine wins for Juventus, ten wins for Real Madrid and two draws), as well as nearly the same goal difference (Madrid ahead 26 to 25).[287][288][289] Their first meeting was in the quarter-finals of the 1961–62 European Cup, which Real Madrid won 3–1 in a replay held in Paris.[288] At the quarter-final stage in 1995–96, Juventus prevailed 2–1 over the two legs and went on to lift the trophy.[288] In the 1998 UEFA Champions League Final between the teams in Amsterdam, Real Madrid won 1–0.[288][290] They met again in the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, when both clubs were in their respective 'golden eras'; Juventus won 4–3 on aggregate.[288] By that time, star midfielder Zinedine Zidane, who played for the Bianconeri in the 1998 final, had moved from Turin to Madrid in a world record €77 million deal.[291] The teams met again in the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League group stage, with Madrid winning 2–1 at home and drawing 2–2 away en route to their tenth title. In the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, former Real Madrid player Álvaro Morata scored one goal in each leg to take Juventus to the final, winning 3–2 on aggregate, while Cristiano Ronaldo scored both goals for Madrid.[288] They faced off again in the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final in Cardiff, with Ronaldo scoring twice as Real Madrid won 4–1.[288][292][293] The latest Champions League meeting was in the 2017–18 quarter-finals, which Real Madrid won 4–3 on aggregate; the tie ended in dramatic and controversial fashion, with a debatable penalty awarded to Real Madrid in the last minute of the second leg after Juventus built a 3–0 lead at the Bernabeu to pull level in the tie following a defeat at the Allianz Stadium by the same scoreline.[294][295] Cristiano Ronaldo scored three goals over the two matches including the decisive penalty and a spectacular overhead kick,[296] and having won the Champions League with Madrid for a fourth time,[297] he transferred to Juventus a few months later for a €117 million fee.[298] It was under Florentino Pérez's first presidency (2000–2006) that Real Madrid started its ambition of becoming the world's richest professional football club.[299] The club ceded part of its training grounds to the city of Madrid in 2001, and sold the rest to four corporations: Repsol YPF, Mutua Automovilística de Madrid, Sacyr Vallehermoso and OHL. The sale eradicated the club's debts, paving the way for it to buy the world's most expensive players, such as Zinedine Zidane, Luís Figo, Ronaldo and David Beckham. The city had previously rezoned the training grounds for development, a move which in turn increased their value, and then bought the site.[78] The European Commission started an investigation into whether the city overpaid for the property, to be considered a form of state subsidy.[300] The sale of the training ground for office buildings cleared Real Madrid's debts of €270 million and enabled the club to embark upon an unprecedented spending spree which brought big-name players to the club. In addition, profit from the sale was spent on a state-of-the-art training complex on the city's outskirts.[301] Although Pérez's policy resulted in increased financial success from the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, especially in Asia, it came under increasing criticism for being too focused on marketing the Real Madrid brand and not enough on the performances of the team.[81] By September 2007, Real Madrid was considered the most valuable football brand in Europe by BBDO. In 2008, it was ranked the second-most valuable club in world football, at €951 million (£640 million / $1.285 billion),[302] only beaten by Manchester United, which was valued at €1.333 billion (£900 million).[303] In 2010, Real Madrid had the highest turnover in football worldwide.[304] In September 2009, Real Madrid's management announced plans to open the club's own dedicated theme park by 2013.[305] A study at Harvard University concluded that Real Madrid \"is one of the 20 most important brand names and the only one in which its executives, the players, are well-known. We have some spectacular figures in regard to worldwide support of the club. There are an estimated 287 million people worldwide who follow Real Madrid.\"[306] In 2010, Forbes evaluated Real Madrid's worth to be around €992 million (US$1.323 billion), ranking them second only to Manchester United, based on figures from the 2008–09 season.[307][308] According to Deloitte, Real Madrid had a recorded revenue of €401 million in the same period, ranking first.[309] Along with Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao and Osasuna, Real Madrid is organised as a registered association. This means that the club is owned by its supporters, who elect the president. The president cannot invest his own money,[310] and the club can only spend what it earns, which is mainly derived through sponsorships, commercial partnerships, merchandise sales, television rights, prize money and ticket sales. Unlike a limited company, it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only a membership.[311] The members of Real Madrid, called \"socios\", form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club.[312] As of 2010, the club had 60,000 socios.[313] At the end of the 2009–10 season, the club's board of directors stated that Real Madrid had a net debt of €244.6 million, €82.1 million lower than the previous fiscal year. Real Madrid announced that it had a net debt of €170 million after the 2010–11 season. From 2007 to 2011, the club made a net profit of €190 million.[314][315] During the 2009–10 season, Real Madrid made €150 million through ticket sales, the most of any club in top-flight football.[314] Real Madrid has the highest number of shirt sales per season, around 1.5 million.[314] For the 2010–11 season, Madrid's wage bill totalled €169 million, which was second-highest in Europe behind Barcelona;[316] furthermore, its wage bill to turnover ratio was the best in Europe at 43 percent, ahead of Manchester United and Arsenal at 46 percent and 50 percent, respectively. In 2013, Forbes listed the club as the world's most valuable sports team, worth $3.3 billion.[317] Real Madrid was valued at €3.47 billion ($4.1 billion) in 2018, and in the 2016–17 season it was the second highest-earning football club in the world, with an annual revenue of €674.6 million.[318] In November 2018, the average first-team pay at Madrid was £8.1m ($10.6m) per year, making it the second-highest paid sports team in the world after Barcelona.[319][320] In 2022, Forbes listed Real Madrid as the most valuable football club in the world, at $5.1 billion.[321] Real Madrid was the featured club in the second installment of the Goal! football movie trilogy, Goal! 2: Living the Dream... (2007). The film follows former Newcastle United star Santiago Muñez as he is first scouted and then signed by Real Madrid for the 2005–06 season. The film's creators wanted to put emphasis on the changes in Muñez's life after his move to Madrid. Production was done with the full support of UEFA, allowing the film crew to use many real life players in cameo roles. Real Madrid squad members featured in the film included Iker Casillas, Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Raúl, Sergio Ramos, Robinho, Michael Owen, Míchel Salgado, Júlio Baptista, Steve McManaman and Iván Helguera. Non-Real Madrid players to make cameo appearances included Ronaldinho, Thierry Henry, Lionel Messi, Samuel Eto'o, Andrés Iniesta, Pablo Aimar, Freddie Ljungberg, Cesc Fàbregas and Santiago Cañizares. In the film, both Florentino Pérez and Alfredo Di Stéfano presented the fictional player Muñez to the club after his signing.[322] Real, The Movie is a 2005 part feature, part documentary film that showcases the worldwide passion for Real Madrid. Produced by the club and directed by Borja Manso, it follows five sub-stories of fans from around the world and their love for the club. Along with the fictional portion of the film, it also contains real footage of the squad, during training at Ciudad Real Madrid, matches, and interviews. Although the film mentions all of the squad, it mainly focuses on galácticos such as David Beckham, Zinedine Zidane, Raúl, Luís Figo, Ronaldo, Iker Casillas and Roberto Carlos, among others. The film was originally produced in Spanish, but has been dubbed for their worldwide fanbase. The book White Storm: 100 years of Real Madrid by Phil Ball was the first English-language history of Real Madrid. Published in 2002, it talks about the most successful moments of the club during its first centenary, having been translated into various languages. In late 2011, Real Madrid released a digital music album, entitled Legends, and a remix of the club's anthem, \"Himno del Real Madrid,\" was released as the first single from the album.[323] Real Madrid TV is an encrypted digital television channel, operated by Real Madrid and specialising in the club. The channel is available in Spanish and English. It is located at Ciudad Real Madrid in Valdebebas (Madrid), Real Madrid's training centre. Hala Madrid is a magazine published quarterly for the Real Madrid club members and the Madridistas Fan Club card holders.[324] The phrase Hala Madrid, meaning \"Forward Madrid\" or \"Go Madrid\", is also the title of the club's official anthem, which is often sung by the Madridistas (the club's fans).[6] The magazine includes reports on the club's matches in the previous month, as well as information about the reserve and youth teams. Features often include interviews with players, both past and present, and the club's historic matches.[324] Real Madrid has appeared in many football-based video games, namely in the FIFA and Pro Evolution Soccer series. A Real Madrid player has appeared on the cover of both titles a combined seven times. In 2007, Spanish game publisher Virgin Play signed a deal with the club to make officially licensed Real Madrid video games. The only one released under the deal (due to Virgin Play's liquidation in September 2009) would end up being Real Madrid: The Game, which was developed by Atomic Planet Entertainment and was published under Virgin Play's publishing division V.2 Play in May 2009 for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Windows, Wii and Nintendo DS exclusively in European territories Virgin Play released their products in. The game featured a career mode with a mixture of role-playing and simulation as well as arcade-styled Football gameplay. Spanish teams are limited to three players without EU citizenship. The squad list includes only the principal nationality of each player; several non-European players on the squad have dual citizenship with an EU country. Also, players from the ACP countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement are not counted against non-EU quotas due to the Kolpak ruling.

Real Madrid was officially founded in 1902, though its history can be traced back to 1897. It joined the Royal Spanish Football Federation in 1909. Real Madrid has won 15 European Cup/Champions League titles, far more than any other team. Real Madrid has won the Copa del Rey, Spain’s main football cup competition, 20 times. Real Madrid played at several venues until club president Santiago Bernabéu spearheaded the construction of the stadium that today bears his name. Opened in 1947, the Bernabéu holds more than 80,000 spectators. Real Madrid's biggest rivalry is with FC Barcelona. Matches between Barcelona and Real Madrid are known as El Clásico (“The Classic”). Real Madrid, Spanish professional football (soccer) club based in Madrid. Known for their all-white uniforms, which led to its nickname “Los Blancos,” Real Madrid is one of the world’s best-known teams. Real Madrid grew out of Football Club Sky, a team formed in Madrid in 1897. The club was officially founded in 1902 and joined the Royal Spanish Football Federation in 1909. Real Madrid played at a variety of venues until ambitious club president Santiago Bernabéu spearheaded the construction of the stadium that bears his name. Opened in 1947, the Bernabéu holds more than 80,000 spectators and was the venue for the 1982 Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup final. The European Cup was first held during the 1955–56 season, with a prestigious field consisting of clubs that had won their own country’s league championship. Real Madrid was the tournament’s first winner, defeating French club Stade de Reims in the final. It continued on a run of European dominance that no team has matched since. Gifted players such as Ferenc Puskás, Alfredo Di Stéfano, Paco Gento, Hector Rial, and Miguel Muñoz helped the club win the first five European Cups in a row. The club’s play in the 1960 European Cup final against the West German team Eintracht Frankfurt—a 7–3 Real victory—is widely considered one of the finest club performances of all time. Real has won a total of 15 European Cup/Champions League titles, far more than any other team. 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1966, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2022, 2024 Real Madrid has won more Spanish top-division (La Liga) championships (36) than any other Spanish side. The club has also won the Copa del Rey, the main Spanish cup competition, 20 times and the Supercopa de España (Spanish Super Cup) 13 times. It won UEFA Cup twice, in 1985 and 1986. Real’s local competition is Atlético Madrid, but the club’s biggest rivalry is with FC Barcelona. The tension between the football clubs from Spain’s two biggest cities was amplified by a struggle between the teams in the 1950s to sign Di Stéfano, who reneged on a proposed deal with Barcelona to sign with Madrid, helping Real become a football power in the 1950s and ’60s. Matches between Barcelona and Real Madrid are known as El Clásico (“The Classic”) and are watched throughout Spain, in large part because the two sides symbolize for many the ongoing political and cultural difficulties between Castilian (Real) and Catalonian (Barcelona) Spain. From the late 1990s Real Madrid spent enormous sums on luring some of the world’s most famous foreign players to the club, where they are known as galácticos (“superstars”). Those players were often the most expensive (by transfer fee) footballers in the world and included such stars as David Beckham, Luis Figo, Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane, Kaká, Cristiano Ronaldo, and James Rodriguez. Sergio Ramos and Iker Casillas are other notable players of this era. Following his departure from Paris Saint-Germain after the 2023–24 season, Kylian Mbappé joined Real Madrid.",

                "content": "The UEFA Champions League (abbreviated as UCL) is an annual club association football competition organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) that is contested by top-division European clubs. The competition begins with a round robin league phase to qualify for the double-legged knockout rounds, and a single-leg final. It is the most-watched club competition in the world and the third most-watched football competition overall, behind only the UEFA European Championship and the FIFA World Cup. It is one of the most prestigious football tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national league champions (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of their national associations. Introduced in 1955 as the Coupe des Clubs Champions Européens (French for European Champion Clubs' Cup), and commonly known as the European Cup, it was initially a straight knockout tournament open only to the champions of Europe's domestic leagues, with its winner reckoned as the European club champion. The competition took on its current name in 1992, adding a round-robin group stage in 1991 and allowing multiple entrants from certain countries since the 1997–98 season.[1] While only the winners of many of Europe's national leagues can enter the competition, the top 5 leagues by coefficient provide four teams each by default,[2] with a possibility for additional spots based on performance during the previous season.[3][4] Clubs that finish below the qualifying spots are eligible for the second-tier UEFA Europa League competition, and since 2021, for the third-tier UEFA Conference League.[5] In its present format, the Champions League begins in early July with three qualifying rounds and a play-off round, all played over two legs. The seven surviving teams enter the league phase, joining 29 teams qualified in advance. The 36 teams each play eight opponents, four home and four away. The 24 highest-ranked teams proceed to the knockout phase that culminates with the final match in late May or early June.[6] The winner of the Champions League automatically qualifies for the following year's Champions League, the UEFA Super Cup, the FIFA Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup.[7][8] Spanish clubs have the most victories (20 wins), followed by England (15 wins) and Italy (12 wins). England has the most winning teams, with six clubs having won the title. The competition has been won by 23 clubs and 13 of them have won it more than once.[9] Real Madrid is the most successful club in the tournament's history, having won it 15 times. Madrid is the only club to have won it five times in a row (the first five editions).[10] Only one club has won all of their matches in a single tournament en route to the tournament victory: Bayern Munich in the 2019–20 season.[11] Real Madrid is the current European champion, having beaten Borussia Dortmund 2–0 in the 2024 final for their fifteenth title. The first time the champions of two European leagues met was in what was nicknamed the 1895 World Championship, when English champions Sunderland beat Scottish champions Heart of Midlothian 5–3.[12] The first pan-European tournament was the Challenge Cup, a competition between clubs in the Austro-Hungarian Empire.[13] Three years later, in 1900, the champions of Belgium, Netherlands and Switzerland, which were the only existing leagues in continental Europe at the time, participated in the Coupe Van der Straeten Ponthoz, thus being dubbed as the \"club championship of the continent\" by the local newspapers.[14][15] The Mitropa Cup, a competition modelled after the Challenge Cup, was created in 1927, an idea of Austrian Hugo Meisl, and played between Central European clubs.[16] In 1930, the Coupe des Nations (French: Nations Cup), the first attempt to create a cup for national champion clubs of Europe, was played and organised by Swiss club Servette.[17] Held in Geneva, it brought together ten champions from across the continent. The tournament was won by Újpest of Hungary.[17] Latin European nations came together to form the Latin Cup in 1949.[18] After receiving reports from his journalists over the highly successful South American Championship of Champions of 1948, Gabriel Hanot, editor of L'Équipe, began proposing the creation of a continent-wide tournament.[19] In interviews, Jacques Ferran (one of the founders of the European Champions Cup, together with Gabriel Hanot),[20] said that the South American Championship of Champions was the inspiration for the European Champions Cup.[21] After Stan Cullis declared Wolverhampton Wanderers \"Champions of the World\" following a successful run of friendlies in the 1950s, in particular a 3–2 friendly victory against Budapest Honvéd, Hanot finally managed to convince UEFA to put into practice such a tournament.[1] It was conceived in Paris in 1955 as the European Champion Clubs' Cup.[1] The first European Cup took place during the 1955–56 season.[22][23] Sixteen teams participated (some by invitation): AC Milan (Italy), AGF Aarhus (Denmark), Anderlecht (Belgium), Djurgården (Sweden), Gwardia Warszawa (Poland), Hibernian (Scotland), Partizan (Yugoslavia), PSV Eindhoven (Netherlands), Rapid Wien (Austria), Real Madrid (Spain), Rot-Weiss Essen (West Germany), Saarbrücken (Saar), Servette (Switzerland), Sporting CP (Portugal), Reims (France) and Vörös Lobogó (Hungary).[22][23] The first European Cup match took place on 4 September 1955, and ended in a 3–3 draw between Sporting CP and Partizan.[22][23] The first goal in European Cup history was scored by João Baptista Martins of Sporting CP.[22][23] The inaugural final took place at the Parc des Princes between Stade de Reims and Real Madrid on 13 June 1956.[22][23][24] The Spanish squad came back from behind to win 4–3 thanks to goals from Alfredo Di Stéfano and Marquitos, as well as two goals from Héctor Rial.[22][23][24] Real Madrid successfully defended the trophy next season in their home stadium, the Santiago Bernabéu, against Fiorentina.[25][26] After a scoreless first half, Real Madrid scored twice in six minutes to defeat the Italians.[24][25][26] In 1958, Milan failed to capitalise after going ahead on the scoreline twice, only for Real Madrid to equalise.[27][28] The final, held in Heysel Stadium, went to extra time where Francisco Gento scored the game-winning goal to allow Real Madrid to retain the title for the third consecutive season.[24][27][28] In a rematch of the first final, Real Madrid faced Stade Reims at the Neckarstadion for the 1959 final, and won 2–0.[24][29][30] West German side Eintracht Frankfurt became the first team not to compete in the Latin cup to reach the European Cup final.[18][31][32] The 1960 final holds the record for the most goals scored, with Real Madrid beating Eintracht Frankfurt 7–3 at Hampden Park, courtesy of four goals by Ferenc Puskás and a hat-trick by Alfredo Di Stéfano.[24][31][32] This was Real Madrid's fifth consecutive title, a record that still stands today.[9] Real Madrid's reign ended in the 1960–61 season when bitter rivals Barcelona dethroned them in the first round.[33][34] Barcelona were defeated in the final by Portuguese side Benfica 3–2 at the Wankdorf Stadium.[33][34][35] Reinforced by Eusébio, Benfica defeated Real Madrid 5–3 at the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam and kept the title for a second consecutive season.[35][36][37] Benfica wanted to repeat Real Madrid's successful run of the 1950s after reaching the showpiece event of the 1962–63 European Cup, but a brace from Brazilian-Italian José Altafini at Wembley gave the spoils to Milan, making the trophy leave the Iberian Peninsula for the first time ever.[38][39][40] Inter Milan beat an ageing Real Madrid 3–1 at the Ernst-Happel-Stadion to win the 1963–64 season and replicate their local-rival's success.[41][42][43] The title stayed in Milan for the third year in a row after Inter beat Benfica 1–0 at their home ground, the San Siro.[44][45][46] Under the leadership of Jock Stein, Scottish club Celtic beat Inter Milan 2–1 in the 1967 final to become the first British club to win the European Cup.[47][48] The Celtic players that day, all of whom were born within 30 miles (48 km) of Glasgow, subsequently became known as the \"Lisbon Lions\".[49] The 1967–68 season saw Manchester United become the first English team to win the European Cup, beating two-times winners Benfica 4–1 in the final.[50] This final came ten years after the Munich air disaster, which had claimed the lives of eight United players and left their manager, Matt Busby, fighting for his life.[51] In the 1968–69 season, Ajax became the first Dutch team to reach the European Cup final, but they were beaten 4–1 by Milan, who claimed their second European Cup, with Pierino Prati scoring a hat-trick.[52] The 1969–70 season saw the first Dutch winners of the competition. Feyenoord knocked out the defending champions, Milan in the second round,[53] before beating Celtic in the final.[54] In the 1970–71 season, Ajax won the title, beating Greek side Panathinaikos in the final.[55] the season saw a number of changes, with penalty shoot-outs being introduced, and the away goals rule being changed so that it would be used in all rounds except the final.[56] It was also the first time a Greek team reached the final, as well as the first season that Real Madrid failed to qualify, having finished sixth in La Liga the previous season.[57] Ajax went on to win the competition three years in row (1971 to 1973), which Bayern Munich emulated from 1974 to 1976, before Liverpool won their first two titles in 1977 and 1978.[58] The following seasons saw victories in 1978–79 and 1979–80 for Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest. The following year Liverpool won their third title before Aston Villa continued the sense of English dominance in 1982. In 1982–83, Hamburger SV broke the English dominance. Liverpool regained it in 1983–84 before losing to Juventus (1984–85); Steaua București then won in 1985–86, Porto in 1986–87, PSV Eindhoven in 1987–88; Milan (2), Red Star Belgrade and Barcelona became champions before the competition was re-formulated as the UEFA Champions League. All English clubs were banned for five years (Liverpool for six years) following the 1985 European Cup final due to the Heysel Stadium disaster. \"Magic...it's magic above all else. When you hear the anthem it captivates you straight away.\" The UEFA Champions League anthem, officially titled simply as \"Champions League\", was written by Tony Britten, and is an adaptation of George Frideric Handel's 1727 anthem Zadok the Priest (one of his Coronation Anthems).[60][61] UEFA commissioned Britten in 1992 to arrange an anthem, and the piece was performed by London's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and sung by the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields.[60] Stating that \"the anthem is now almost as iconic as the trophy\", UEFA's official website adds it is \"known to set the hearts of many of the world's top footballers aflutter\".[60] The chorus contains the three official languages used by UEFA: English, German, and French.[62] The climactic moment is set to the exclamations 'Die Meister! Die Besten! Les Grandes Équipes! The Champions!'.[63] The anthem's chorus is played before each UEFA Champions League game as the two teams are lined up, as well as at the beginning and end of television broadcasts of the matches. In addition to the anthem, there is also entrance music, which contains parts of the anthem itself, which is played as teams enter the field.[64] The complete anthem is about three minutes long, and has two short verses and the chorus.[62] Special vocal versions have been performed live at the Champions League final with lyrics in other languages, changing over to the host nation's language for the chorus. These versions were performed by Andrea Bocelli (Italian; Rome 2009, Milan 2016 and Cardiff 2017), Juan Diego Flores (Spanish; Madrid 2010), All Angels (Wembley 2011), Jonas Kaufmann and David Garrett (Munich 2012) and Mariza (Lisbon 2014). In the 2013 final at Wembley, the chorus was played twice. In the 2018 and 2019 finals, held in Kyiv and Madrid respectively, the instrumental version of the chorus was played, by 2Cellos (2018) and Asturia Girls (2019).[65][66] In the 2023 final, held in Istanbul, Hungarian pianist Ádám György performed the piano version of the anthem.[67] The anthem has been released commercially in its original version on iTunes and Spotify with the title of Champions League Theme. In 2018, composer Hans Zimmer remixed the anthem with rapper Vince Staples for EA Sports' video game FIFA 19, with it also featuring in the game's reveal trailer.[68] In 1991, UEFA asked its commercial partner, Television Event and Media Marketing (TEAM), to help brand the Champions League. This resulted in the anthem, \"house colours\" of black and white or silver and a logo, and the \"starball\". The starball was created by Design Bridge, a London-based firm selected by TEAM after a competition.[69] TEAM gives particular attention to detail in how the colours and starball are depicted at matches. According to TEAM, \"Irrespective of whether you are a spectator in Moscow or Milan, you will always see the same stadium dressing materials, the same opening ceremony featuring the 'starball' centre circle ceremony, and hear the same UEFA Champions League Anthem\". Based on research it conducted, TEAM concluded that by 1999, \"the starball logo had achieved a recognition rate of 94 percent among fans\".[70] The UEFA Champions League used to begin with a double round-robin group stage of 32 teams until it evolved into a league phase of 36 teams, which is preceded by two qualification 'streams' for teams that do not receive direct entry to the tournament proper. The two streams are divided between teams qualified by virtue of being league champions, and those qualified by virtue of finishing second, third or fourth in their national championship. The number of teams that each association enters into the UEFA Champions League is based upon the UEFA coefficients of the member associations. These coefficients are generated by the results of clubs representing each association during the previous five Champions League, Europa League and Conference League seasons. The higher an association's coefficient, the more teams represent the association in the Champions League, and the fewer qualification rounds the association's teams must compete in. Five of the remaining seven qualifying places are granted to the winners of a four-round qualifying tournament between the remaining 43 or 44 national champions, within which those champions from associations with higher coefficients receive byes to later rounds. The other two are granted to the winners of a three-round qualifying tournament between ten and eleven clubs from the associations ranked 5–6 through 15, which have qualified based upon finishing second, third or fourth in their respective national league. In addition to sporting criteria, any club must be licensed by its national association to participate in the Champions League. To obtain a license, the club must meet certain stadium, infrastructure and finance requirements. In 2005–06, Liverpool and Artmedia Bratislava became the first teams to reach the Champions League group stage after playing in all three qualifying rounds. Real Madrid and Barcelona hold the record for the most appearances in the group stage, having qualified 25 times, followed by Porto and Bayern Munich on 24.[71] Between 1999 and 2008, no differentiation was made between champions and non-champions in qualification. The 16 top-ranked teams spread across the biggest domestic leagues qualified directly for the tournament group stage. Prior to this, three preliminary knockout qualifying rounds whittled down the remaining teams, with teams starting in different rounds. An exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions League the year before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers.[72] UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that, if the Champions League winner fell outside of its domestic league's top four, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league. Until 2015–16, no association could have more than four entrants in the Champions League.[73] In May 2012, Tottenham Hotspur finished fourth in the 2011–12 Premier League, two places ahead of Chelsea, but failed to qualify for the 2012–13 Champions League, after Chelsea won the 2012 final.[74] Tottenham were demoted to the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League.[74] In May 2013,[75] it was decided that, starting from the 2015–16 season (and continuing at least for the three-year cycle until the 2017–18 season), the winners of the previous season's UEFA Europa League would qualify for the UEFA Champions League, entering at least the play-off round, and entering the group stage if the berth reserved for the Champions League title holders was not used. The previous limit of a maximum of four teams per association was increased to five, meaning that a fourth-placed team from one of the top three ranked associations would only have to be moved to the Europa League if both the Champions League and Europa League winners came from that association and both finished outside the top four of their domestic league.[76] In 2007, Michel Platini, the UEFA president, had proposed taking one place from the three leagues with four entrants and allocating it to that nation's cup winners. This proposal was rejected in a vote at a UEFA Strategy Council meeting.[77] In the same meeting, however, it was agreed that the third-placed team in the top three leagues would receive automatic qualification for the group stage, rather than entry into the third qualifying round, while the fourth-placed team would enter the play-off round for non-champions, guaranteeing an opponent from one of the top 15 leagues in Europe. This was part of Platini's plan to increase the number of teams qualifying directly into the group stage, while simultaneously increasing the number of teams from lower-ranked nations in the group stage.[78] In 2012, Arsène Wenger referred to qualifying for the Champions League by finishing in the top four places in the Premier League as the \"4th Place Trophy\". The phrase was coined after a pre-match conference when he was questioned about Arsenal's lack of a trophy after exiting the FA Cup. He said \"The first trophy is to finish in the top four\".[79] At Arsenal's 2012 AGM, Wenger was also quoted as saying: \"For me there are five trophies every season: Premier League, Champions League, the third is to qualify for the Champions League...\"[80] Beginning with the 2024–25 season, UEFA changed the format of their three club competitions, abandoning the group stage in favour of an expanded league phase.[81] The number of participating teams was increased from 32 to 36 teams. Teams are no longer divided into groups of four teams each but are ranked in a single table. Each team plays eight matches against eight different opponents. For the draw of the league phase, teams are divided into four seeding pots according to their UEFA coefficient. Each team will play against two teams from each pot, one home and one away. The league phase is played from September to January, while the knockout phase begins in February, with matches predominantly played on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. After the league phase, a two-legged knockout play-off round is played between teams finishing 9–16 (seeded) and 17–24 (unseeded) in the league phase. Teams finishing in the top eight of the league phase receive a bye to the round of 16 as seeded teams, while the eight winning teams from the knockout play-off round will enter the round of 16 draw as unseeded teams. Teams finishing 25th–36th place in the league phase and the eight losers of the knockout play-offs are eliminated from the competition and from European football since it is no longer possible to enter the Europa League from the league phase onwards. After the round of 16 the competition follows the traditional knockout format with quarter-finals, semi-finals (both two legged and without association draw protection) and then the final at a venue chosen prior to the season. The final is typically held in late May or early June. Prior to the 2024–25 season, the tournament proper began with a group stage of 32 teams, divided into eight groups of four.[82] The draw to determine which teams entered each group was seeded based on each team's UEFA coefficient, and no group could contain more than one club from each association. Each team played six group stage games, meeting the other three teams in its group home and away in a round-robin format.[82] The first place team and the runners-up from each group then progressed to the next round. The third-placed teams entered the Europa League's knockout round and the fourth-placed teams were eliminated from the competition. For the next stage – the last 16 – the winning team from one group played against the runners-up from another group, but teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other (see random two-sided matching). From the quarter-finals onwards, the draw was entirely random, without association protection.[83] The group stage was played from September to December, whilst the knockout stage began in February, with matches usually played on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. The knockout ties were played in a two-legged format, with the exception of the final. In the 2019–20 season, due to the COVID-19 pandemic the tournament was suspended for five months. The format of the remainder of the tournament was temporarily amended as a result, with the quarter-finals and semi-finals being played as single match knockout ties at neutral venues in Lisbon, Portugal in the summer with the final taking place on 23 August 2020.[84] The following is the default access list. Changes will be made to the access list above if the Champions League or Europa League title holders qualify for the tournament via their domestic leagues. Each year, the winning team is presented with the European Champion Clubs' Cup, the current version of which has been awarded since 1967. From the 1968–69 season and prior to the 2008–09 season any team that won the Champions League three years in a row or five times overall was awarded the official trophy permanently.[86] Each time a club achieved this, a new official trophy had to be forged for the following season.[87] Five clubs own a version of the official trophy: Real Madrid, Ajax, Bayern Munich, Milan and Liverpool.[86] Since 2008, the official trophy has remained with UEFA and the clubs are awarded a replica.[86] The current trophy is 74 cm (29 in) tall and made of silver, weighing 11 kg (24 lb). It was designed by Jürg Stadelmann, a jeweller from Bern, Switzerland, after the original was given to Real Madrid in 1966 in recognition of their six titles to date, and cost 10,000 Swiss francs. As of the 2012–13 season, 40 gold medals are presented to the Champions League winners, and 40 silver medals to the runners-up.[88] Starting with the 2024–25 season, the distribution of the prize money is as follows.[89] A large part of the distributed revenue from the UEFA Champions League is linked to the \"market pool\", the distribution of which is determined by the value of the television market in each nation. For the 2019–20 season, Paris Saint-Germain, who were the runners-up, earned nearly €126.8 million in total, of which €101.3 million was prize money, compared with the €125.46 million earned by Bayern Munich, who won the tournament and were awarded €112.96 million in prize money.[90] Like the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA Champions League is sponsored by a group of multinational corporations, in contrast to the single main sponsor typically found in national top-flight leagues. When the Champions League was created in 1992, it was decided that a maximum of eight companies should be allowed to sponsor the event, with each corporation being allocated four advertising boards around the perimeter of the pitch, as well as logo placement at pre- and post-match interviews and a certain number of tickets to each match. This, combined with a deal to ensure tournament sponsors were given priority on television advertisements during matches, ensured that each of the tournament's main sponsors was given maximum exposure.[91] From the 2012–13 knockout phase, UEFA used LED advertising hoardings installed in knockout participant stadiums, including the final. From the 2015–16 season onwards, UEFA has used such hoardings from the play-off round until the final.[92] Since 2021, the UEFA also used Virtual Board Replacement (VBR) technology to offer region-based advertising; regional sponsors are inserted into the hoardings as shown on the broadcast feed in specific regions along with the global sponsors.[93][94] Individual clubs may wear jerseys with advertising. However, only two sponsorships are permitted per jersey in addition to that of the kit manufacturer, at the chest and the left sleeve.[95] Exceptions are made for non-profit organisations, which can feature on the front of the shirt, incorporated with the main sponsor or in place of it; or on the back, either below the squad number or on the collar area.[96] If a club plays a match in a nation where the relevant sponsorship category is restricted (such as France's alcohol advertising restriction), then they must remove that logo from their jerseys. For example, when Rangers played French side Auxerre in the 1996–97 Champions League, they wore the logo of the holiday chain Center Parcs instead of their primary sponsor, McEwan's Lager (both companies at the time were subsidiaries of Scottish & Newcastle).[97] The tournament's main sponsors for the 2024–27 cycle are: Adidas is a secondary sponsor and supplies the official match ball, while Macron supplies the referee kits.[107] The competition attracts an extensive television audience, not just in Europe, but throughout the world. The final of the tournament has been, in recent years, the most-watched annual sporting event in the world.[108] The final of the 2012–13 tournament had the competition's highest TV ratings to date, drawing approximately 360 million television viewers.[109] Notes Players that are still active in Europe are highlighted in boldface. The table below does not include appearances made in the qualification stage of the competition. Starting from the 2021–22 edition, UEFA introduced the UEFA Champions League Player of the Season award. The jury is composed of the coaches of the clubs that participated in the group stage of the competition, as well as 55 journalists selected by the European Sports Media (ESM) group, one from each UEFA member association. In the same season, UEFA also introduced the UEFA Champions League Young Player of the Season award.",

The final will be played on 31 May 2025 at Allianz Arena in Munich, Germany.[4] The winners of the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League will automatically qualify for the 2025–26 UEFA Champions League league phase, the 2025 FIFA Intercontinental Cup, the 2029 FIFA Club World Cup, and earn the right to play against the winners of the 2024–25 UEFA Europa League in the 2025 UEFA Super Cup. Real Madrid are the defending champions, having won their record-extending 15th title last season. A total of 81 teams from 53 of the 55 UEFA member associations are set to participate in the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League (the exceptions being Liechtenstein which does not organise a domestic league and Russia which is currently suspended). The association ranking based on the UEFA association coefficients is used to determine the number of participating teams for each association:[5] For the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League, the associations were allocated places according to their 2023 UEFA association coefficients, which took into account their performance in European competitions from 2018–19 to 2022–23.[6] The table reflects Russia's ongoing suspension from UEFA. Apart from the allocation based on the association coefficients, associations could have additional teams participating in the Champions League, as noted below: The information here reflects the suspension of Russia in European football, and so the following changes to the default access list were made: As the Champions League title holders (Real Madrid) qualified via their domestic league's standard berth allocation, the following changes to the default access list were made: As the Europa League title holders (Atalanta) qualified via their domestic league's standard berth allocation, the following changes to the default access list were made: The labels in the parentheses show how each team qualified for the place of its starting round: The second qualifying round, third qualifying round and play-off round were divided into Champions Path (CH) and League Path (LP). The schedule of the competition is as follows.[9] Compared to past seasons, one \"exclusive week\" will be introduced in which Thursday will also be a matchday.[2][10][11] All matches in other weeks will be played on Tuesdays and Wednesdays apart from the final. The draw for the first qualifying round was held on 18 June 2024. The first legs were played on 9 and 10 July, and the second legs were played on 16 and 17 July 2024. The winners of the ties advanced to the Champions Path second qualifying round. 12 of the 14 losers were transferred to the Conference League Champions Path second qualifying round and 2 were transferred to the Conference League Champions Path qualifying and received a bye to the third qualifying round. The draw for the second qualifying round was held on 19 June 2024. The first legs were played on 23 and 24 July, and the second legs were played on 30 and 31 July 2024. The winners of the ties advanced to the third qualifying round of their respective path. The Champions Path losers were transferred to the Europa League Champions Path third qualifying round, while the League Path losers were transferred to the Europa League Main Path third qualifying round. The draw for the third qualifying round was held on 22 July 2024. The first legs were played on 6 and 7 August, and the second legs were played on 13 August 2024. The winners of the ties advanced to the play-off round of their respective paths. The Champions Path losers were transferred to the Europa League play-off round, while the League Path losers were transferred to the Europa League league phase. The draw for the play-off round was held on 5 August 2024. The first legs were played on 20 and 21 August, and the second legs were played on 27 and 28 August 2024. The winners of the ties advanced to the league phase. The losers were transferred to the Europa League league phase. The league phase draw for the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League took place at the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco on 29 August 2024, 18:00 CEST.[12][13] The 36 teams were divided into four pots of nine teams each based on their UEFA club coefficient, except for the Champions League title holders, who were automatically placed as the top seed in pot 1. The 36 teams were manually drawn and then automated software digitally drew their eight different opponents at random, determining which of their matches were at home and which ones away. Each team will face two opponents from each of the four pots, one at home and one away. Teams could not face opponents from their own association, and could only be drawn against a maximum of two sides from the same association.[14] Aston Villa, Bologna, Brest, Girona and Slovan Bratislava made their debut appearances since the introduction of the group stage. Brest and Girona also made their debut appearances in European football.[15][16] A total of 16 national associations are represented in the league phase. The top eight ranked teams will receive a bye to the round of 16. The teams ranked from 9th to 24th will contest the knockout phase play-offs, with the teams ranked from 9th to 16th seeded for the draw. Teams ranked from 25th to 36th are eliminated from all competitions, with no access to the 2024–25 UEFA Europa League. In the knockout phase, teams will play against each other over two legs on a home-and-away basis, except for the one-match final. The bracket structure for the knockout phase is partially fixed in advance using seeding, with teams' positions in the bracket determined by the final standings in the league phase. In the knockout phase, there is no country protection, with teams from the same association able to face each other in any round. The mechanism of the draws for each round is as follows:[5] The following teams have secured a place in the knockout phase: Guaranteed to finish 1–16 The draw for the knockout phase play-offs will be held on 31 January 2025.

                "content": "The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox. As hundreds of firefighters continue to battle a wind-driven Malibu wildfire that prompted evacuations near Pepperdine University, officials said a \"minimal number\" of homes have been destroyed. The Franklin Fire started at 10:50 p.m. Monday in Malibu Canyon near South Malibu Canyon and Francisco Ranch roads, Cal Fire said. As of 12:29 p.m., the fire burned at least 2,713 acres, or 4.239 square miles. That is a slight increase from 2,667 acres reported at 12:16 p.m. There is no known containment around the fire, which is the perimeter crews build around the fire burn area to prevent flames from spreading farther. Cal Fire officials at a news conference said they did not know how many homes have been destroyed, only saying it's a \"minimal number.\" More than 8,100 structures are threatened, and of those structures, more than 2,000 residents are under an evacuation order, meaning you are lawfully required to leave immediately because of the threat to safety. First responders have also warned another 6,000 residents to be ready to evacuate if conditions worsen. Cal Fire said that there have been no \"serious\" injuries or fatalities reported. Law enforcement at the conference said a patrol car was damaged by the flames, but no deputies were injured. They are also warning that they will arrest any looters who try to enter the evacuation zone. The cause of the fire is unknown, but the fire's quick spread and threat to safety resulted in Gov. Gavin Newsom acquiring a grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to help with firefighting efforts, according to the governor's office. “Fire officials and first responders are working relentlessly to protect lives and property from the Franklin Fire,\" Newsom said in a written release. \"California is grateful for this federal support, which bolsters these efforts. I urge all residents in affected areas to stay alert and follow evacuation orders.\" Through FEMA, the Fire Management Assistance Grant will allow local, state and tribal agencies battling the fire to apply for 75% reimbursement of \"eligible fire suppression costs.\" “Just seeing the flames grow and seeing that bright red color of fire just get brighter and brighter and brighter — it was so scary,” student Gabrielle Salgado told KABC-TV. The university later said the worst of the fire had pushed past campus. View real-time evacuations as they are issued in the map below. Can't see it? Click here. The fire burned amid dangerous fire conditions because of Southern California’s notorious Santa Ana winds. The evacuation order encompassed about 6,000 people and more than 2,000 structures, KABC-TV reported, attributing that information to fire officials. Pepperdine canceled classes and finals for the day and there was a shelter-in-place order that lasted for hours before the university lifted it at 8:05 a.m. Officials said about 800 students were impacted by the order. Fire engines were on campus and helicopters were dropping water collected from lakes in the school’s Alumni Park onto the fire. Pacific Coast Highway is closed between Carbon Canyon and Corral Canyon Road and is available for evacuees only. Find the latest on closures here. Below is information about evacuation shelters and locations to drop off any small animals or livestock. Evacuation shelters Small animals Large animals Meteorologist Tamara Berg said winds surpassing 40 mph are being recorded where the fire is burning. Power to tens of thousands of people had been shut off by Monday night as utilities worked to mitigate the impacts of Santa Ana winds, which bring strong gusts that can damage electrical equipment and spark wildfires. Santa Anas are dry, warm and gusty northeast winds that blow from the interior of Southern California toward the coast and offshore. They typically occur during the fall months and continue through winter and into early spring. The Weather Service issued a red flag warning for high fire risk with a rare “particularly dangerous situation,” or PDS, designation starting at 8 p.m. Monday into Tuesday for Los Angeles and Ventura counties. That warning was extended through 4 a.m. Wednesday because of strong winds and low humidity. While crews battle the fire, officials are asking residents in the surrounding area to not use sprinklers, explaining that firefighters will need the water and that sprinklers would not halt a brush fire's advance. Cal Fire expects to increase the number of personnel fighting the fire to about 1,000 staff as they are rushing to extinguish the flames before winds pick up again. -The Associated Press contributed to this reporting.

                "content": "Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Homes have been destroyed in a wind-fueled wildfire that erupted in Malibu, California, Monday and prompted evacuations and a brief shelter-in-place order at Pepperdine University, officials said. Around 20,000 people were under evacuation orders after the blaze, dubbed the Franklin Fire, broke out shortly before 11 p.m. Monday in the Malibu Canyon area, the Los Angeles County fire and sheriff’s departments said. The fire occurred as Southern California was under red flag warnings because of strong Santa Ana winds, low humidity and dry vegetation. The fire has burned around 3,000 acres and was 0% contained by Tuesday evening, the state firefighting agency said. Firefighters planned to take advantage of easing conditions overnight. \"We want to wake up tomorrow morning and make sure we at least start getting some containment,” Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said Tuesday. “Because remember, we’re going to be in a red flag alert through Wednesday at 8 pm.” Marrone said \"a small number\" of homes have been destroyed and damaged, but an exact count was not yet known. The city of Malibu said the blaze had spread across Pacific Coast Highway (also known as Highway 1) toward the Malibu Pier area — a tourist attraction beloved by locals and surfers. An aerial view showed that seven structures have been destroyed and eight others damaged, Marrone said, but that is preliminary and a more accurate count is expected later. No serious injuries or deaths have been reported, he said. High winds of between 40 to over 60 mph continued in the Santa Monica Mountains on Tuesday, according to reports to the National Weather Service. Local officials have said around 8,100 structures were in the affected area, most under evacuation warnings. Evacuation orders were in place for points south of Piuma Road, east of east of Puerco Canyon Road and west of Los Flores Canyon Road; and also between the Pacific Ocean coastline and Tuna Canyon Park to the west of Tuna Canyon Road, Los Angeles County said. Other areas were under evacuation warnings. The county has a list of evacuation orders and a map online. The Palisades Recreation Center was being used as an evacuation center. A large animal shelter was at Pierce College in Woodland Hills, the city of Malibu said on its website. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office said Tuesday on X that the state had secured a grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency “to help ensure the availability of vital resources to suppress the fire.” The cause of the fire is not yet known. Marrone said it is under investigation by the fire department and arson investigators at the sheriff’s department. Each year, around 10% to 15% of California’s wildfires are caused by arson, but higher temperatures and intensifying drought conditions — both results of climate change — are increasing the overall risk that blazes ignite and spread quickly. “It’s undeniable, from my perspective, that global warming is causing more challenges for us,” Marrone said. The red flag warnings in California affected around 12 million residents from San Luis Obispo to San Diego on Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service. Santa Ana winds caused gusts of around 60 mph and more in the Santa Monica Mountains, the weather service for the region said. The San Gabriel Mountains, east of Los Angeles, saw a gust recorded at 93 mph Monday night, and Boney Mountain in the Santa Monica range saw a gust of 76 mph Tuesday, it said. Malibu, a beach city north of Los Angeles known for being home to many celebrities, was one of several areas under a rare, “particularly dangerous situation” red flag warning, “due to damaging Santa Ana winds and very low humidities,” according to the weather service. Actor and entertainer Dick Van Dyke said that he and his wife were among the evacuees. Other areas under the same \"particularly dangerous\" warning level include the San Gabriel Mountains, the Santa Clarita Valley, Calabasas, Ventura County coasts and valleys, and the western San Fernando Valley. Pepperdine University, in Malibu, issued a shelter-in-place notice for community members around 1 a.m. Tuesday, then lifted it shortly after 7 a.m. During that time, anyone on campus was directed to shelter at the campus center or library. Videos on social media showed orange flames visible outside school windows. In a statement around 7:30 a.m., school officials said it was safe to return to on-campus residences but added that “the community is strongly encouraged to remain on campus and stay off Malibu roads.” Operations at the university were suspended Tuesday, with classes and finals canceled. Southern California Edison, a primary utility provider in the area, has implemented power shutoffs for public safety because of the wildfire risk. Those outages affect more than 10,000 customers in Los Angeles County, nearly 9,000 in San Bernardino County and more than 2,000 in Kern County. Shutoffs are also in effect for much of Malibu, the city said. All Malibu schools are closed through Thursday, the school district said Tuesday. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said her office is monitoring the fire. “Thank you to all first responders working to battle this blaze,” she wrote on X.

                "content": "28 Years Later is an upcoming post-apocalyptic horror film produced and directed by Danny Boyle from a screenplay written by Alex Garland. It is the third installment in the 28 Days Later film series, following 28 Days Later (2002) and 28 Weeks Later (2007). It stars Jodie Comer, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Ralph Fiennes, with Cillian Murphy reprising his role from the first film. Produced by Columbia Pictures[3] in association with the British Film Institute, Decibel Films, and DNA Films, 28 Years Later marks the returns of Boyle and Garland as director and writer after they served only as executive producers on the second film. It is scheduled to be released in the United States by Sony Pictures Releasing on June 20, 2025. It was shot back-to-back with its sequel 28 Years Later Part II: The Bone Temple, which will be directed by Nia DaCosta, written and produced by Boyle and Garland, and starring Murphy. Twenty eight years after the events of 28 Weeks Later, the Rage Virus has returned, and a group of survivors must face a world ravaged by hordes of the infected.[4] In June 2007, Fox Atomic confirmed development on a third 28 Days Later film, dependent upon the financial performance of 28 Weeks Later following its home video release.[5] In July of the same year, Danny Boyle said that the story for a third installment had been mapped out.[6] By October 2010, Alex Garland stated that due to differences involving the film rights, the project had been delayed.[7] In January 2011, Boyle stated that he believed the project would be realized, stating confirming further developments for the story.[8] By April 2013, however, the filmmaker expressed uncertainty as to whether the movie would be made.[9] In January 2015, Garland addressed the project's status, confirming that while it had fallen into development hell there were serious discussions going on behind the scenes to produce the project. Reiterating that development was progressing, stating that the script he was working on would tentatively be titled 28 Months Later.[10] In June 2019, Boyle confirmed that he and Garland had been working on the third installment.[11] In March 2020, Imogen Poots expressed interest in reprising her role from the second film,[12] followed by Cillian Murphy in May 2021.[13] In November 2022, Boyle, Garland and actor Murphy all indicated their interest in making a sequel to 28 Days Later.[14] In June 2023, Boyle and Garland expressed in collaboration their intentions to \"seriously\" and \"diligently\" see the project enter production; while announcing that the script was now titled 28 Years Later, acknowledging the years it had taken to be developed. Boyle stated that he would like to serve as director, unless Garland chooses to.[15] By July of the same year, Murphy stated that he had recently discussed the possibility of a third film with Boyle; once again expressing interest in reprising his role if Boyle and Garland return to the franchise in their creative roles.[16] In January 2024, it was announced that a third film titled 28 Years Later was officially in development; with plans for the project to be the first of a new trilogy of sequels. Danny Boyle will direct the first installment, with a script written by Alex Garland; while the latter will also write the scripts for each of planned sequels. Boyle, Garland, Andrew Macdonald, and Peter Rice will serve as producers.[17][18] In February of the same year, Murphy discussed his potential involvement with the project.[19] In March 2024, Garland confirmed that he is writing a trilogy of sequel films.[20] The following month, the writer stated that the film Kes was a major influence on his work for 28 Years Later.[21] Murphy was revealed as an executive producer later that month.[22] In April, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Jodie Comer and Ralph Fiennes were cast to star it,[23] with Jack O'Connell joining the cast,[24] and Murphy being confirmed to reprise his role as Jim.[25] Erin Kellyman would be added to the cast in June.[26] Principal photography began on May 7, 2024, in Northumberland,[27][28] with Anthony Dod Mantle serving as the cinematographer.[29] Filming wrapped on July 29.[30] The film was notably shot on an iPhone 15 Pro Max with the aid of numerous specialised attachments.[31] Filming locations include Holy Island (Lindisfarne) off the Northumberland Coast (the village and the causeway seen in aerial view in the first trailer), Hexham, Bellingham, Kielder Forest, Rothbury (Northumberland), Newcastle upon Tyne (Tyne and Wear), Waskerley (County Durham), Melsonby, Ripon , Fountains Abbey, Aysgarth Falls, Redmire (North Yorkshire) and Bradford (West Yorkshire).[32][33][34][35][36] Some scenes were filmed at Plankey Mill Farm, near Langley and Bardon Mill (Northumberland).[33] 28 Years Later is scheduled to be released in the United States and Canada by Sony Pictures Releasing on June 20, 2025.[37] In April 2024, Nia DaCosta entered early negotiations to direct the second film in the new trilogy of sequels, with Boyle, Garland, Andrew Macdonald, Peter Rice, and Bernie Bellew attached as producers.[38] The following month, DaCosta was confirmed to have signed onto the project as director. The movie is filming back-to-back with 28 Years Later,[38] with principal photography beginning on August 19, 2024.[39] The film's title was revealed as 28 Years Later Part II: The Bone Temple.[40]",

Boyle reteams with writer Alex Garland (28 Days Later, Ex Machina, Annihilation) on 28 Years Later, which is intended to kick off a brand new TRILOGY of movies for the franchise. Watch the official trailer for 28 Years Later below. 28 Years Later will be unleashed in theaters on June 20, 2025 from Sony. In the new movie, “It’s been almost three decades since the rage virus escaped a biological weapons laboratory, and now, still in a ruthlessly enforced quarantine, some have found ways to exist amidst the infected. One such group of survivors lives on a small island connected to the mainland by a single, heavily-defended causeway. When one of the group leaves the island on a mission into the dark heart of the mainland, he discovers secrets, wonders, and horrors that have mutated not only the infected but other survivors as well.” From what we understand, the first TWO movies in the 28 Years Later trilogy have already been filmed. Boyle directs the first installment, while Nia DaCosta (Candyman, The Marvels) directs the second. Alex Garland (28 Days Later) wrote the screenplay for 28 Years Later. Additionally, Cillian Murphy is executive producing and reportedly returning to star. The horror movie’s cast includes Jack O’Connell (Amy Winehouse: Back To Black), Jodie Comer (Alone in the Dark, “Killing Eve”), Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Kraven the Hunter), ​Alfie Williams (“His Dark Materials”) and Ralph Fiennes (The Menu). The original movie in 2002 starred Cillian Murphy and was written by Alex Garland and directed by Danny Boyle.

Tuesday, December 10 – These Five New Horror Movies Released at Home Today Fur-Gotten Classics: 7 Underseen Werewolf Movies Worth Biting Into Friday, December 6 – These 11 New Horror Movies Just Released Today! Published on By This week brings A24’s latest horror film and Sony’s final Venom movie home, alongside the next nightmare from the French duo behind hits including Inside and The Deep House. Here’s all the new horror released on Tuesday, December 10, 2024! For daily reminders about new horror releases, be sure to follow @HorrorCalendar. Fresh off a Golden Globes nomination for Hugh Grant, A24’s new horror movie Heretic from directors Scott Beck and Bryan Woods has made its debut on at-home Digital today. You can rent the film for $19.99 or purchase it for $24.99. Hugh Grant (D&D: Honor Among Thieves), Chloe East (The Fabelmans) and Sophie Thatcher (“Yellowjackets”) lead the cast of the upcoming horror movie. In the film… “Two missionaries are forced to prove their faith when they knock on the wrong door and are greeted by a diabolical Mr. Reed, becoming ensnared in his deadly game of cat-and-mouse.” Meagan Navarro wrote in her review for Bloody Disgusting, “Heretic is a movie that’s ultimately carried on the back of its villain, and Grant’s daffy, amused portrayal of Mr. Reed might be enough to make you a convert.” She also notes, “the smart casting, powerhouse performances, and an infectious sense of humor ensure that it remains engaging.” The latest SCREAMBOX Exclusive is the Argentinian exorcism horror movie Deus Irae, and it’s now streaming only on SCREAMBOX as well as available for rental on major VOD outlets. Deus Irae is the debut feature of Argentine filmmaker Pedro Cristiani. The film follows Father Javier, a priest living a fractured existence. On one side, he assists families who claim to have witnessed miracles, and on the other he belongs to a trio of excommunicated priests who hunt the possessed to exorcize them with fire and shotguns. But when the only way to crush Evil is by becoming something even worse, he must question how much of his own humanity he’s willing to sacrifice in order to defeat the Devil. French filmmakers Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo (Inside, Leatherface, The Deep House) are back with The Soul Eater, and it’s available on VOD from Dark Sky Films today. The new horror movie is an adaptation of the novel by Alexis Laipsker. In The Soul Eater, “The chilling drama unfolds against the backdrop of a mountain village where an old legend about a malevolent creature resurfaces following the disappearance of local children and a series of violent and gruesome deaths.” Virginie Ledoyen (Rabid Dogs, The Beach), Paul Hamy (Get In), and Sandrine Bonnaire star. The directors reteam with Kandisha cinematographer Simon Roca for their latest. Fans of Lovecraftian horror may want to check out Mark Andrew Hamer’s Replicator, a practical effects-heavy homage to Stuart Gordon classics that’s now available on VOD. Replicator won two Nightmare awards at the Nightmares Film Festival, including Best Supporting Performance for Brian Spangler and the “Gag Reel | FX” festival award for David Henson Greathouse for his practical special FX makeup and creature design work. In the film, “Scarred by a troubled past, small-town public defender Darby Vincent is in constant pursuit of justice in a town littered with morally and ethically challenged individuals. When the town’s more nefarious citizens begin one-by-one to make 180 degree turns to righteousness, seemingly overnight, Darby embarks on a journey that reveals violent otherworldly forces may be responsible. And the way to virtue is a bloody and terrifying road.” Brey Noelle and Katelynn E. Newberry star. Tom Hardy is back as Venom in Sony’s third franchise installment Venom: The Last Dance, released at home today. You can rent the film for $19.99 or purchase it for $24.99. In Venom: The Last Dance, Tom Hardy returns as Venom, one of Marvel’s greatest and most complex characters, for the final film in the trilogy. That’s the plan for now, at least… “Eddie and Venom are on the run. Hunted by both of their worlds, the duo are forced into a devastating decision that will bring the curtains down on their last dance.” Chiwetel Ejiofor, Juno Temple, Rhys Ifans, Peggy Lu, Alanna Ubach and Stephen Graham also star. The film is directed by Kelly Marcel from a screenplay she wrote. Based on a story by Tom Hardy and Kelly Marcel, the upcoming third Venom film is produced by Avi Arad, Matt Tolmach, Amy Pascal, Kelly Marcel, Tom Hardy and Hutch Parker.

Drafted in 2012 by the San Diego Padres in the first round, seventh overall, Fried made his major league debut in 2017. His 17 wins in 2019 were 2nd-most in the National League, and his seven wins in 2020 were again 2nd-most in the NL. Fried pitched 6 shut-out innings in the final game of the 2021 World Series against the Houston Astros, helping lead the Braves to their first World Series title in 26 years.[2] Through 2023, Fried had the best career win–loss percentage of all Braves pitchers, at .705. In 2020, Fried won the NL Gold Glove Award at pitcher and the Fielding Bible Award at pitcher. In 2021, he won the Gold Glove Award again, as well as the Silver Slugger Award for pitchers, becoming the third pitcher in MLB history to win both awards in the same year. He was also named to the All-MLB Team those two years. In 2022 he was named an All Star, and won his third consecutive Gold Glove Award at pitcher. In 2024 he was again an All Star. Fried was born and grew up in Encino, California, the middle son of Carrie and Jonathan Fried, and is Jewish.[3][4][5] His younger brother Jake, also a pitcher, attended the University of Arizona.[6] Max began attending the Reggie Smith Baseball Academy in Encino, California, at the age of seven, and learned how to throw a curveball from the retired outfielder.[7] Fried pitched for the 2009 Maccabiah Games Team USA Juniors baseball team that won a gold medal in Israel.[8] Fried first attended Montclair College Preparatory School, in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, where he played baseball, football, and basketball.[9] As a sophomore, with Ethan Katz as his pitching coach, he was 10–3 with a 1.81 earned run average (ERA), and was named the Olympic League MVP and to the All-California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) Division V first team.[10][11][12] In his junior year Fried was 7–3 with a 1.31 ERA, with 100 strikeouts in 69 innings, as he also played outfield and batted .360 with four home runs and 30 RBIs.[13][14] He was named the 2011 Southern California Jewish Sports Hall of Fame Male High School Athlete of the Year.[11] After Montclair Prep cut its baseball team subsequent to his junior year, Fried then transferred to Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles, where he wore uniform number 32 in honor of Sandy Koufax and played with fellow future MLB pitchers Lucas Giolito and Jack Flaherty.[8] In 2012, his senior year, Fried was 8–2 with a 2.02 ERA, and 105 strikeouts in 66 innings.[15][16] He was a 2012 Rawlings-Perfect Game 1st Team All-American.[17] The San Diego Padres selected Fried in the first round with the seventh overall selection of the 2012 Major League Baseball draft.[18] Fried chose to sign with the Padres for $3 million despite his commitment to the UCLA Bruins baseball team.[3][19] Baseball America rated him the top left-hander available in the draft.[20] Fried made his professional debut for the Arizona League Padres in 2012 and spent the whole season there, going 0–1 with a 3.57 ERA in 17.2 innings pitched. He played for the Fort Wayne TinCaps in 2013 where he compiled a 6–7 record and 3.49 ERA in 23 starts.

The next month, on August 20, Fried underwent Tommy John surgery; he missed the remainder of the 2014 season.[21] On December 19, 2014, the Padres traded Fried, Jace Peterson, Dustin Peterson, and Mallex Smith to the Atlanta Braves in exchange for Justin Upton and Aaron Northcraft.[24] Fried missed the entire 2015 season while recovering from Tommy John surgery.[21] He returned to action on April 9, 2016, for the Rome Braves.[25] Fried spent all of 2016 with Rome, pitching to an 8–7 record and 3.93 ERA in 21 games (20 starts), striking out 112 batters in 103.0 innings.

For the second consecutive season he tied for the major league lead in pickoffs (6).[39] In the three years in which Fried was a starter, from 2019 to 2021, he led all National League pitchers in wins (38), was tied for the lead in shutouts (2), was 2nd in the vertical movement of his curveball (−11.6 inches; batters hit .183/.218/.294 against it), and had the third-lowest barrels percentage in balls hit against him (5.0%).[87] In those three years on offense he led NL pitchers in runs (18), doubles (7), on base percentage (.292), and WAR (1.3), was 2nd-lowest in strikeout percentage (25.8%), and third in batting average (.234), slugging percentage (.297), OPS (.589), and walks (9).[88] In those three years on defense he led all NL pitchers in assists (86).[89] Fried won the final game of the 2021 World Series with six shutout innings against the Astros, who had led the majors in batting average and runs for the season, with Houston's three-time batting champion Jose Altuve observing: \"He was almost unhittable.\"[90] Fried won the 2021 NL Gold Glove Award at pitcher, winning the award for the second year in a row.[91][92] He became the third Braves pitcher to win multiple Gold Glove Awards, joining Greg Maddux and Phil Niekro.[93] Major League managers and coaches (voting only within their league, and unable to vote for players on their own team), account for 75% of the selection process, while the other 25% is a sabermetric component.[94] Fried also won the 2021 NL Silver Slugger Award for pitchers.[95] The award was given to the top offensive player at pitcher in the NL, as determined by a vote by the manager and three coaches of each MLB team (and no manager/coach can vote for a player on his own team).[96][97] Fried became the third MLB pitcher in history to win both the Silver Slugger Award and the Gold Glove Award in the same season, joining Mike Hampton (2003) and Zack Greinke (2019).[98] Fried was the final recipient of the Silver Slugger Award for pitchers, as the National League permanently implemented the designated hitter in 2022. He was named a starter on the 2021 All-MLB Second Team, earning his second consecutive All-MLB selection.[99] Through 2021, of the Braves career leaders, Fried was second in win–loss percentage (.690; behind Russ Ortiz and ahead of Greg Maddux).[100] Fried was named to his second straight Opening Day start in 2022.[101][102][103] Fried's salary for the 2022 season was set at $6.85 million via arbitration.[104] He was named to the 2022 Major League Baseball All-Star Game roster at midseason.[105][106] For the season, Fried was 14-7 with a 2.48 ERA (3rd in the NL; 10th-lowest in Atlanta franchise history), in 30 starts in which he pitched 185.1 innings with 170 strikeouts.[107][108] He gave up the lowest percentage of hard-hit balls in the NL (24.5%) and had the lowest barrel-percentage against (4.0%), was 2nd in fewest walks/9 innings (1.55), 3rd in strikeouts/walk (5.31) and fewest home runs/9 innings (0.58), 4th in ground ball percentage (51.2%), and tied for 5th in highest LOB (78.2%).[109] His curveball had the highest vertical movement of those of all NL pitchers, the exit velocity of balls hit against him (86.2 mph) was the third-lowest in the NL, and batters swung at his pitches outside the strike zone 36.8% of the time, the fourth-highest rate in the NL.[110] In the four seasons from 2019 to 2022, he had the lowest barrel-percentage against (4.6%) of all major league pitchers, and his 52 wins were second in the major leagues only to the 56 wins of pitcher Gerrit Cole.[111] On defense, opponents became hesitant to run on him.[112] Since his major league debut in 2017, his 23 pickoffs lead major league baseball, with him having picked the runner off in 14.29% of his career pickoff attempts, a much higher percentage than the major league average of 1.6%.[113] Fried was named the 2022 NL Gold Glove Award winner at pitcher, his third straight Gold Glove Award.[112] He became the first Braves pitcher since Greg Maddux to win three straight Gold Glove Awards.[114] The only other pitchers who have won the award three times in a row have been Harvey Haddix, Bobby Shantz, Bob Gibson, Phil Niekro, and Zack Greinke.[115] Fried finished second in the voting for the 2022 NL Cy Young Award.[116] It was the second time in three years he finished in the top five in Cy Young Award voting, as he had finished fifth in 2020.[117] At the end of the 2022 season, Fried was selected to his third consecutive All-MLB team.[118] Fried's 2023 season salary of $13.5 million was again determined by the arbitration process.[119] As the Opening Day starter for the third straight year, Fried was removed in the fourth inning against the Washington Nationals.[120][121] He spent time on the 15-day injured list in early April and early May, first for a strained left hamstring, then a strained left forearm.[122][123][124] On June 5, Fried was transferred to the 60-day injured list.[125] He was activated on August 4.[126] In the 2023 regular season Fried was 8–1 with a 2.55 ERA (the second-lowest in the major leagues among pitchers with at least 14 starts), as in 14 starts he had one shutout, and struck out 80 batters while giving up 18 walks in 77.2 innings.[39] Batters hit .109 against his curveball.[63][1] Of NL pitchers who pitched 70 or more innings in 2023, he was 2nd in ground ball percentage (57.7%) and lowest hard-hit percentage (24.2%), 3rd in lowest barrel percentage (3.8%), 5th in ERA, 6th in left-on-base percentage (82.3%) and lowest average exit velocity (86.5 mph), 7th in lowest line drive percentage (16.8%), and 9th in home runs/9 innings (0.81).[127] He ended the season as the Braves' career leader in won-loss percentage (.705), second in strikeouts/9 innings pitched (8.835), fourth in strikeouts/walk (3.688), eighth in WHIP (1.163), and 10th in hits per nine innings pitched (8.075).[100] From the beginning of his first full season in 2019 to the end of the 2023 regular season, Fried recorded 60 wins, the most in the NL and second to Gerrit Cole's 71 victories during this time period.[128][100] His 25 pickoffs since debuting in 2017 were the most in major league baseball, and in his career he had picked off a runner in 14.5% of his pickoff attempts, much higher than the MLB average during that period of 1.7%.[1] Fried and the Braves agreed to a one-year $15 million contract for the 2024 season, his final season before free agency.[129][130] Fried's streak of Opening Day starts was ended by Spencer Strider.[131][132] In Fried's season debut, the second game of the year against the Philadelphia Phillies, he recorded only two outs.[133][134] On April 23, Fried pitched a complete game shutout against the Miami Marlins, facing 29 hitters and throwing 92 pitches for his third career Maddux.[135] He pitched a scoreless inning for the NL team in the All Star Game, the second of his career.[39] In 2024, Fried was 11–10 with one shutout in 29 starts covering 174.1 innings, in which he gave up 146 hits and 57 walks while striking out 166 batters, and led the NL in ground ball percentage (58.8%) while having the second-lowest exit velocity (86.3 mph) and percentage of \"hard speed\" contact induced (26.1%).[39][136] He had a 3.25 ERA (5th in the NL), with 7.5 hits per 9 innings (7th), 0.64 home runs per 9 innings (4th), and a 1.164 WHIP (8th), keeping opposing batters to a .225 batting average (7th), while on defense he tied for the league lead with a 1.000 fielding percentage.[39][136] Fried received a qualifying offer from the Braves at the end of the season,[137][138] which he declined.[139] Fried throws a 94–96 mph four-seam fastball.[63] He also throws two types of a 74 mph \"plus\" curveball (which he patterned after that of Sandy Koufax), an 85 mph slider (since 2019), a 93 mph sinker, and an 86 mph change-up,[63][140][141] with the curveball resulting in the lowest batting average in 2021 (.160).[63]",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Two days after missing out on retaining superstar right fielder Juan Soto, the Yankees pivoted to signing left-handed ace Max Fried. He is heading from Atlanta to the Bronx on an eight-year, $218 million deal, and he will team with Gerrit Cole for a ferocious 1-2 punch in the Yankees rotation. Fried didn't get Soto's $765 million, but he does end up with one of the most lucrative contracts in MLB history, especially if we isolated pitchers. Here's a look, by the numbers. We don't have an exact year-by-year breakdown just yet and it's possible the deal is backloaded, but the average annual value (AAV) is $27,250,000. There will be some consternation on the number of years, but that number per season is a bargain for a pitcher with Fried's proven track record. There are reportedly no opt outs or deferred money (via USA Today), and there's a full no-trade clause (via New York Post). Fried's deal ranks as the fourth-highest ever for a pitcher in terms of total money. Here are the seven contracts that have exceeded $170 million. Possibly of interest: Fried is the highest-ranked lefty on the list. We're leaving two-way star Shohei Ohtani off of all lists here. The only two lefties there are Fried and Snell, who both signed this offseason. As noted above, Fried's average annual value isn't too bad considering a pitcher of his pedigree. Among current deals only, he checks in at sixth. If we looped in the biggest AAV deals in history, some shorter term deals for Justin Verlander ($43,333,333 for 2023-24) and Max Scherzer ($43,333,333 from 2022-24) would sit tied at the top. Strasburg's deal had an AAV of $35 million. Again, the Yankees missed out on Soto, but they still have plenty of monster contracts on the roster. Fried's doesn't crack the top three but does give them three of the four MLB pitchers with deals of at least $150 million. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

They will now go into 2025 without one of their key pitchers as Max Fried has signed with the New York Yankees. Fried signed an eight-year, $218 million deal with the Yankees on December 10, according to ESPN's Jeff Passan. \"BREAKING: Left-hander Max Fried and the New York Yankees are in agreement on a eight-year, $218 million contract, pending physical, sources tell ESPN,\" Passan wrote on X. \"It is the largest guarantee in baseball history for a left-handed pitcher.\" The Braves All-Star made history in a unique way by earning the most guaranteed money by a southpaw. He had spent his entire big league career with the Braves. He is a two-time All-Star and a World Series champion with the organization. The Yankees ultimately saved $700 million dollars in total money by missing out on Soto. They have needs to fill throughout the roster and Fried is a good start. He had a 3.25 ERA last season in 29 starts. He struck out 166 batters as well. He will become the Yankees No. 2 starter behind Gerrit Cole. He and Cole could give the Yankees one of the best one-two punches in Major League Baseball. The team had already met with the beloved Braves pitcher and now the two sides come to an agreement. Fried gets his well-deserved payday. He will be missed in Atlanta but has the opportunity to help lead the Yankees to back-to-back American League championships and potentially a World Series.

                "title": "Bill Belichick - Wikipedia",
                "content": "William Stephen Belichick (/ˈbɛlɪtʃɪk, ˈbɛlɪtʃɛk/; born April 16, 1952) is an American sports analyst and American football coach. Widely regarded as one of the greatest head coaches of all time,[1][2][3] he holds numerous coaching records, including the record of most Super Bowl wins (six) as a head coach, all with the New England Patriots, along with two more during his time as the defensive coordinator of the New York Giants, for a record eight combined total Super Bowl victories as coach and coordinator.[4] A renowned American football historian, Belichick is often referred to as a \"student of the game\" with a deep knowledge of the intricacies of each player position.[5][6][7][8] During his tenure with the Patriots, Belichick was a central figure as the head coach and de facto general manager during the franchise's dynasty from 2001 to 2019.[9] Belichick is a descendant of the Bill Parcells coaching tree. He began his coaching career in 1975 as an assistant for the Baltimore Colts and became the defensive coordinator for New York Giants head coach Bill Parcells by 1985. Parcells and Belichick won two Super Bowls together before Belichick left to become the head coach of the Cleveland Browns in 1991. He remained in Cleveland for five seasons but was fired following the team's 1995 season. Belichick rejoined Parcells, first in New England where the team lost Super Bowl XXXI, and later with the New York Jets. After being named head coach of the Jets, Belichick resigned after only one day on the job to accept the head coaching job for the Patriots on January 27, 2000. In 24 seasons under Belichick, the Patriots won 17 AFC East division titles, made 13 appearances in the AFC Championship Game, and appeared in nine Super Bowls, with a record six wins. Overall, Belichick has won eight Super Bowl titles (the most of any individual in NFL history) and finished as runner-up four times from his combined time as an assistant and head coach. At the time Belichick left the Patriots, he was the NFL's longest-tenured active head coach. Belichick has the most playoff coaching wins all-time with 31 and ranks third in regular season coaching wins in the NFL with 302.[10] He is also in second place for combined regular season and postseason wins, and also second place for most regular season coaching wins with one franchise.[11] Belichick is one of only three head coaches who have won six NFL titles.[12] He was named the AP NFL Coach of the Year for the 2003, 2007, and 2010 seasons. Belichick has also been selected to the NFL 2000s All-Decade Team, NFL 2010s All-Decade Team, as well as the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team. Belichick was born in Nashville, Tennessee, on April 16, 1952,[13] the son of Jeannette (née Munn) and Steve Belichick.[14] Belichick was named after College Football Hall of Fame coach Bill Edwards, who was his godfather.[15] He is of Croatian ancestry;[16] his paternal grandparents, Marija Barković and Ivan Biličić, emigrated from Draganić in 1897 and settled in Monessen, Pennsylvania, having changed their names to Mary and John Belichick at the suggestion of immigration officers.[17] Belichick was raised in Annapolis, Maryland,[18] where his father was an assistant football coach at the United States Naval Academy. Belichick has said his father is one of his most important football mentors, and Belichick often studied football with him.[19] Bill reportedly learned to break down game films at a young age by watching his father and the Navy staff do their jobs.[20] Belichick graduated from Annapolis High School in 1970, where he was a classmate of Sally Brice-O'Hara, who would later become the Vice Commandant of the Coast Guard.[21][22] While there, Belichick played football and lacrosse, with the latter being his favorite sport.[23] Belichick enrolled at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, for a postgraduate year, with the intention of improving his grades and test scores to be admitted into a quality college.[24] The school honored Belichick 40 years later by inducting him into its Athletics Hall of Honor in 2011.[25] Belichick attended Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, where he played center and tight end. In addition to being a member of the football team, Belichick played lacrosse and squash, serving as the captain of the lacrosse team during his senior season. A member of Chi Psi fraternity,[26] Belichick earned a bachelor's degree in economics in 1975.[27] Eventually, he was part of the inaugural induction class into the university's Athletics Hall of Fame in spring 2008.[28] After graduating, Belichick took a $25-per-week job as an assistant to Baltimore Colts head coach Ted Marchibroda in 1975.[29] In 1976, Belichick joined the Detroit Lions as their assistant special teams coach before adding tight ends and wide receivers to his coaching duties in 1977.[30] Belichick was dismissed along with head coach Tommy Hudspeth and the rest of the coaching staff on January 9, 1978.[31] He spent the 1978 season with the Denver Broncos as their assistant special teams coach and defensive assistant while also serving as director of films.[32][33] In 1979, Belichick began a 12-year stint with the New York Giants alongside head coach Ray Perkins as a defensive assistant and special teams coach.[34] Belichick added linebackers coaching to his duties in 1980 and was named defensive coordinator in 1985 under head coach Bill Parcells, who had replaced Perkins in 1983. The Giants won Super Bowl XXI and Super Bowl XXV following the 1986 and 1990 seasons.[35][36] Belichick's defensive game plan from the New York Giants' 20–19 upset of the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXV has been placed in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[37] From 1991 until 1995, Belichick was the head coach of the Cleveland Browns. During his tenure in Cleveland, Belichick compiled a 36–44 record, leading the team to the playoffs in 1994, his only winning year with the team.[38] Coincidentally, Belichick's lone playoff victory during his Browns tenure was achieved against the New England Patriots, who were coached by former Giants head coach Bill Parcells, in the Wild Card Round during that postseason.[39] In Belichick's final season in Cleveland, the Browns finished 5–11 despite starting 3–1.[40] One of his most controversial moves was cutting quarterback Bernie Kosar midway through the 1993 season. Kosar was signed by the Dallas Cowboys two days later and won a Super Bowl with the Cowboys in Super Bowl XXVIII as a backup. In November 1995, in the middle of the ongoing football season, Browns owner Art Modell had announced he would move his franchise to Baltimore after the season.[41] After first being given assurances that he would coach the new team that would later become the Baltimore Ravens, Belichick was instead fired on February 14, 1996, a week after the shift was officially announced.[42] In the 2013 episode of A Football Life on the Cleveland Browns relocation controversy, many sports journalists who had covered the Browns at the time had said that in retrospective, Belichick had laid the groundwork for the Ravens success in the ensuring decades including their win in Super Bowl XXXV (with Cleveland holdovers Matt Stover and Rob Burnett still with the team at that point), setting up the infrastructure by giving recently retired tight end Ozzie Newsome his first front-office job and had planned on drafting Ray Lewis in the 1996 NFL Draft if Belichick and the team stayed in Cleveland. (Indeed, the newly-christened Ravens did draft Lewis, who went on to a 17-year Hall of Fame career with the team.) Those who had covered the Browns went on to state that if the original Browns had stayed in Cleveland, Belichick would have seen his work through. For his part, Belichick stated that he was able to learn from some mistakes he had made with the Browns while largely sticking to his blueprint from Cleveland when resurrecting the Patriots, such as factoring in off-the-field issues that can affect performance. Among those interviewed, the general consensus was that Belichick's failure in Cleveland was more to do with Modell's financial struggles (even paying a young Scott Pioli only $14,000/year--equivalent to $32,447 in 2024--as a scout) that eventually led the NFL to force the sale of the Ravens to Steve Bisciotti than Belichick's own doing.[43] After his dismissal by the Cleveland Browns, Belichick served under Parcells again as assistant head coach and defensive backs coach with the New England Patriots for the 1996 season. The Patriots finished with an 11–5 record and won the AFC Championship over the Jacksonville Jaguars, but they lost to the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XXXI amid rumors of Parcells's impending defection.[44][45] Belichick had two stints as the head coach of the New York Jets without ever coaching a game. In February 1997, Belichick, who had been an assistant coach under Bill Parcells with the New York Giants and New England Patriots, was named the Jets interim head coach while the Jets and Patriots continued to negotiate compensation to release Parcells from his contract with the Patriots and allow Parcells to coach the Jets.[46] Six days later, the Patriots and Jets reached an agreement that allowed Parcells to coach the Jets, and Belichick became the team's assistant head coach and defensive coordinator.[47] When Parcells stepped down as head coach after the 1999 season, he had already arranged with team management to have Belichick succeed him. However, Belichick was the Jets' head coach for only one day. On January 4, 2000, when Belichick was introduced as head coach to the media—the day after his hiring was publicized—he turned it into a surprise resignation announcement. Before taking the podium, Belichick scrawled a resignation note on a napkin that read, in its entirety, \"I resign as HC of the NYJ.\" He then delivered a half-hour speech explaining his resignation to the assembled press corps.[48] Soon after this bizarre turn of events, Belichick was introduced as the Patriots' 12th full-time head coach, succeeding the recently fired Pete Carroll.[49] The Patriots had inquired to the Jets about permission to interview him for their vacant spot at head coach just prior to Parcells stepping down.[50] Parcells and the Jets claimed that Belichick was still under contract to the Jets, and demanded compensation from the Patriots. NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue agreed, and the Patriots gave the Jets a first-round draft pick in 2000 in exchange for the right to hire Belichick.[51] Soon after hiring Belichick, owner Robert Kraft gave him near-complete control over the team's football operations, making him the de facto general manager as well. Until 2009, Belichick split many of the duties normally held by a general manager on other clubs with player personnel director Scott Pioli, though Belichick had the final say on football matters.[52] Pioli left for the Kansas City Chiefs after the 2008 season.[53] The Patriots went 5–11 in the 2000 regular season and missed the playoffs.[54] In 2001, the Patriots went 11–5 in the regular season, and in the playoffs defeated the Oakland Raiders (in the \"Tuck Rule Game\") and Pittsburgh Steelers on the way to the Super Bowl.[55][56] In Super Bowl XXXVI, Belichick's defense held the St. Louis Rams' offense, which had averaged 31 points during the season, to 17 points, and the Patriots won on a last-second field goal by Adam Vinatieri.[57] The win was the first Super Bowl championship in Patriots history.[58] The following season (2002)—the first in Gillette Stadium—the Patriots went 9–7 and missed the playoffs.[59] New England finished with the same record as the New York Jets and the Miami Dolphins, but the Jets won the AFC East title as a result of the third tiebreaker (record among common opponents).[60] The Patriots' 2003 season started with a 31–0 loss to the Buffalo Bills in Week 1, a few days after they released team defensive captain Lawyer Milloy.[61][62] However, they dominated through the remainder of the season to finish 14–2, setting a new franchise record for wins in a season.[63] In the final week of the regular season, the Patriots avenged their loss to the Bills by the same 31–0 score.[64] They defeated the Tennessee Titans in the divisional round of the playoffs. Playing against the Indianapolis Colts and Co-MVP Peyton Manning in the AFC Championship Game (Steve McNair of the Titans was also Co-MVP), the Patriots recorded four interceptions, and advanced to Super Bowl XXXVIII, where they defeated the Carolina Panthers 32–29 on a late Adam Vinatieri field goal.[65][66] Belichick was awarded the NFL Coach of the Year Award. In 2004, the Patriots once again finished with a 14–2 record, and they defeated the Indianapolis Colts in the divisional round of the playoffs.[67][68] They opened the season at 6–0, which combined with the 15 straight wins to end the previous season, gave New England 21 consecutive victories to break the record for most wins in a row formerly held by the Miami Dolphins with 18 straight victories in the 1972 and 1973 seasons. They defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Championship Game. In Super Bowl XXXIX, the Patriots beat the Philadelphia Eagles and became only the second team to win three Super Bowls in four years.[69][70] Belichick is the only coach to accomplish the feat as the Dallas Cowboys had two head coaches in the stretch they won three of four from 1992 to 1995. With a new defensive coordinator in Eric Mangini and no named offensive coordinator, the Patriots went 10–6 in the 2005 season and defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars in the Wild Card Round before losing to the Denver Broncos in the Divisional Round.[71][72][73] Earlier, with a season-opening win over the Oakland Raiders, Belichick notched his 54th win with the Patriots, passing Mike Holovak as the winningest coach in Patriots history. The Patriots finished with a 12–4 record in the 2006 season and defeated the New York Jets by a score of 37–16 in the Wild Card Round.[74][75] They then beat the San Diego Chargers the next week in the Divisional Round, before losing to the eventual Super Bowl XLI champion Indianapolis Colts in the AFC Championship by a score of 38–34.[76][77] The Patriots led 21–3 midway through the second quarter, but the Colts mounted one of the great comebacks in playoff history.[78] In 2007, Belichick led the Patriots to the first perfect regular season since the introduction of the 16-game regular season schedule in 1978, only the fourth team to do so in National Football League history after the 1934[79] and 1942 Chicago Bears[80] and 1972 Miami Dolphins. In the Divisional Round of the playoffs, they defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars by a score of 31–20. In the AFC Championship, the Patriots defeated the San Diego Chargers by a score of 21–12. The Patriots were upset in Super Bowl XLII 17–14 by the New York Giants, his former team, due to the defense allowing a famous play to David Tyree near the end of regulation.[81] The Patriots' failure to attain a \"perfect season\" (undefeated and untied, including playoffs) preserved the Miami Dolphins as the sole team to do so, having finished their 1972 regular season at 14–0 and having won three games in the playoffs. Only two other teams in professional football have recorded a perfect season—the 1948 Cleveland Browns (14–0) of the then All-America Football Conference and the 1948 Calgary Stampeders (12–0) of the Canadian Football League. No team in the former American Football League ever had a perfect season. During the Patriots' 2008 season-opener against the Kansas City Chiefs, quarterback Tom Brady sustained a season-ending injury in the first quarter.[82] Backup quarterback Matt Cassel was named the starter for the remainder of the season. However, with a win in Week 2, the Patriots broke their own record for regular season wins in a row with 21 (2006–08). After losing over 12 players to the injured reserve list, including Rodney Harrison, Adalius Thomas, and Laurence Maroney, the Patriots still managed their league-leading eighth consecutive season with a winning record, going 11–5.[83] However, the Patriots, who finished second in the AFC East, missed the playoffs for the first time since 2002, losing on tiebreakers to the Miami Dolphins (who won the division on the fourth tiebreaker, better conference record) and the Baltimore Ravens (who beat out the Patriots for the last playoff spot due to a better conference record).[84] The 1985 Denver Broncos are the only other 11-win team to miss the playoffs in a 16-game season.[85] In 2009, with a fully healthy Tom Brady back as the starting quarterback, Belichick was able to guide the Patriots to yet another AFC East division title with a 10–6 record.[86] However, the Patriots lost to the Baltimore Ravens in the Wild Card Round.[87] In an incident dubbed \"Spygate\",[88] on September 9, 2007, NFL security caught a Patriots video assistant taping the New York Jets' defensive signals from the sidelines, which is not an approved location. The NFL rules state: \"No video recording devices of any kind are permitted to be in use in the coaches' booth, on the field, or in the locker room during the game.\" Jets coach Eric Mangini, a former Patriots assistant, tipped off league officials that the Patriots might have been filming their signals. After the game, the Jets formally complained to the league. On September 13, the NFL fined Belichick $500,000—the largest fine ever imposed on a coach in the league's 87-year history,[89] and fined the Patriots $250,000. Additionally, the Patriots forfeited their first-round draft pick in the 2008 NFL draft. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, a former employee of the Jets, said that he fined the Patriots as a team because Belichick exercises so much control over the Patriots' on-field operations that \"his actions and decisions are properly attributed to the club.\" Goodell considered suspending Belichick but decided that taking away draft picks would be more severe in the long run.[90] Gary Myers, a columnist for New York's Daily News columnist, stated Belichick should have been suspended by Goodell for the Patriots' next game against the Jets.[91] Belichick later issued the following statement: I accept full responsibility for the actions that led to tonight's ruling. Once again, I apologize to the Kraft family and every person directly or indirectly associated with the New England Patriots for the embarrassment, distraction and penalty my mistake caused. I also apologize to Patriots fans and would like to thank them for their support during the past few days and throughout my career. [...] As the Commissioner acknowledged, our use of sideline video had no impact on the outcome of last week's game. We have never used sideline video to obtain a competitive advantage while the game was in progress. [...] Part of my job as head coach is to ensure that our football operations are conducted in compliance of the league rules and all accepted interpretations of them. My interpretation of a rule in the Constitution and Bylaws was incorrect. [...] With tonight's resolution, I will not be offering any further comments on this matter. We are moving on with our preparations for Sunday's game. The sanctions against Belichick were the harshest imposed on a head coach in league history until the New Orleans Saints' Sean Payton was suspended for the entire 2012 season for covering up a scheme in which bounties were paid for deliberately knocking opponents out of games. Following the incident and its fallout, Belichick led the Patriots to a perfect 16–0 regular season record, and was awarded the 2007 NFL Coach of the Year Award, as voted on by the Associated Press.[92] In the 2010 season, Belichick and the Patriots finished with a 14–2 record for the top seed in the AFC.[93] However, their postseason ended quickly with a 28–21 loss to the New York Jets in the divisional round.[94] In the 2011 season, the Patriots topped the AFC with a 13–3 record.[95] Following a victory over the Denver Broncos in the divisional round of the playoffs, the Patriots won the AFC Championship game, beating the Baltimore Ravens 23–20 when the Ravens failed to score a touchdown and Baltimore's kicker, Billy Cundiff, missed a routine 32-yard field goal attempt to tie the game and send it into overtime.[96][97] This sent New England to their fifth Super Bowl under Belichick. In Super Bowl XLVI, the Patriots lost in the Super Bowl XLII rematch to the New York Giants by a score of 21–17.[98] On September 26, 2012, following a 31–30 loss to the Baltimore Ravens, Belichick was fined $50,000 for grabbing a replacement official's arm while asking for more specific clarity on a ruling after Baltimore had narrowly converted a last-second field goal attempt to secure the win.[99] The Patriots finished the 2012 regular season with a 12–4 record. In the divisional round of the playoffs, they defeated the Houston Texans by a score of 41–28 and made it to the AFC Championship Game, where they lost to the eventual Super Bowl XLVII champion Baltimore Ravens by a score of 28–13, ending their season.[100][101] The Patriots began the 2013 season with much upheaval on the offensive side of the ball with the injury of Rob Gronkowski, the arrest and subsequent release of Aaron Hernandez, the departures of Wes Welker to the Denver Broncos and Danny Woodhead to the San Diego Chargers in free agency, and the release of Brandon Lloyd. To replace them, the Patriots signed Danny Amendola in free agency, drafted rookies Aaron Dobson and Josh Boyce, and signed undrafted rookie free agent Kenbrell Thompkins. The team finished the season with a 12–4 record, winning the AFC East and securing a playoff berth and a first-round bye, seeding second in the AFC standings.[102] In the Divisional Round, they defeated the Indianapolis Colts by a score of 43–22.[103] They lost to the Denver Broncos in the AFC Championship Game by a score of 26–16.[104] In the 2014 season, Belichick's Patriots started 2–2. At a mid-week press conference following a 41–14 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, Belichick famously uttered, \"We're on to Cincinnati\" (referring to the Patriots' next opponent), several times in response to follow-up questions and criticisms of his team, Brady in particular.[105] Ultimately, they recorded a 12–4 record for the third straight season.[106] In the Divisional Round, they defeated the Baltimore Ravens by a score of 35–31.[107] During the AFC Championship Game, they defeated the Indianapolis Colts by a score of 45–7.[108] They reached Super Bowl XLIX, where they defeated the Seattle Seahawks by a score of 28–24.[109] With his fourth championship as head coach, Belichick tied Chuck Noll for most Super Bowl wins by a head coach.[110] In the 2015 season, the Patriots recorded a 12–4 record for the fourth straight season.[111] They defeated the Kansas City Chiefs in the Divisional Round by a score of 27–20.[112] During the AFC Championship Game, the Patriots narrowly lost to the eventual Super Bowl 50 champion Denver Broncos by a score of 20–18.[113] In the 2016 season, the Patriots recorded a 14–2 record, which earned them the #1 seed for the AFC playoffs.[114] In the Divisional Round, they defeated the Houston Texans by a score of 34–16.[115] During the AFC Championship Game, they defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers by a score of 36–17.[116] They reached Super Bowl LI, where they defeated the Atlanta Falcons in a comeback victory by a score of 34–28 in overtime.[117] The Patriots were down 28–3 at one point in the third quarter.[118] With the victory, Belichick won his record fifth Super Bowl title as a head coach.[119] In the 2017 season, the Patriots went 13–3, setting an NFL record eighth consecutive 12-or-more-win seasons, capturing their ninth consecutive AFC East title and their 15th of the last 17 seasons. They defeated the Tennessee Titans in the Divisional Round by a score of 35–14 and the Jacksonville Jaguars in the AFC Championship Game by a score of 24–20, claiming their second consecutive AFC title, while also extending their record of consecutive AFC Championship Game appearances with seven.[120][121] Super Bowl LII was Belichick's eighth title game as head coach and his eleventh overall in any capacity, which was also the Patriots' tenth appearance, all extending NFL records. The Ringer wrote that Belichick's \"team is different from many of New England's famous teams from the previous decade: The first iteration of the Patriots dynasty relied on defense. This year, they are 29th in yards allowed (though fifth in points allowed) and instead have perfected the art of situational football.\" The latter Patriots teams were noted for mounting late comebacks in playoff games.[122][123] However, the Patriots fell to the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LII, 41–33, as Eagles quarterback Nick Foles repeated his dominant NFC Championship Game performance and led Philadelphia to victory in a high-scoring game. The Patriots were down early, as they had been in most of their Super Bowl wins. However, they could not make a comeback this time, although they came very close. Eagles defensive end Brandon Graham strip-sacked Tom Brady to get the ball back with about two minutes to go in the fourth quarter. The Patriots did get the ball again before the end of the game, but they ran out of time to score.[124] In the 2018 season, the Patriots went 11–5, failing to win 12 or more games for the first time since 2009. Despite this, they still captured their 10th consecutive AFC East title and their 16th of the last 18 years. They defeated the Los Angeles Chargers in the Divisional Round by a score of 41–28 and the Kansas City Chiefs during the AFC Championship Game 37–31 in a tough overtime game in Kansas City to advance to their third straight Super Bowl.[125][126] In Super Bowl LIII, the Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams 13–3 to give Belichick his sixth Super Bowl championship as a head coach and his eighth overall to have the most Super Bowl rings in NFL history. His six championships matched both George Halas and Curly Lambeau for most championships as a head coach. The Patriots' defense held the high-scoring Rams offense to only 260 total yards.[127][128] On May 13, 2019, Belichick announced that he would assume another role as the Patriots' defensive coordinator starting the 2019 season.[129] On October 27, 2019, with the Patriots' win over the Cleveland Browns, Belichick obtained his 300th win, regular and postseason combined, as a head coach.[130] The Patriots finished the 2019 regular season with a 12–4 record, winning their 11th consecutive AFC East title.[131] However, the Patriots were defeated in the Wild Card Round of the playoffs by the Tennessee Titans, led by former Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel, by a score of 20–13.[132] Following the departure of Tom Brady to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Belichick and the Patriots were faced with an uncertain quarterback situation for the first time in nearly two decades.[133] During the offseason, the Patriots signed former Carolina Panthers starter Cam Newton for the 2020 NFL season.[134] The off-season routines and schedules, as well as the normal processes of regular season were severely disrupted by the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the unanticipated difficulties and challenges of the pandemic, the Patriots were in the hunt for a playoff spot until late in the season, ultimately finishing 7–9. The 2020 season was Belichick's first losing season since his first year in New England.[135] In the 2021 NFL draft, the Patriots selected quarterback Mac Jones with the 15th overall pick.[136] After Jones and Newton competed for the starting job during the preseason, Belichick made the decision to release Newton and name Jones the starter for the upcoming season.[137][138] During Week 4, Brady's Tampa Bay Buccaneers visited the Patriots in his first trip to Gillette Stadium since signing with the Buccaneers. A missed 56-yard field goal by Patriots kicker Nick Folk allowed Tampa Bay to narrowly escape with a 19–17 victory.[139] Immediately after the game, Brady and Belichick shared a quick embrace on the field before Brady greeted his former teammates and other members of the Patriots organization.[140] Though fans criticized Belichick for his lack of warmth displayed towards his former quarterback, the two privately spoke at length in the Buccaneers locker room following the match.[141] Belichick helped lead the Patriots to a 10–7 record in 2021. The team fell to the Buffalo Bills in the Wild Card Round by a score of 47–17.[142] In the 2022 season, despite starting quarterback Mac Jones being injured in Week 3 and subsequently missing three more weeks, the Patriots remained in the hunt for a playoff spot until the last week, finishing with a record of 8–9.[143][144] During Week 4 of the 2023 season, the Patriots lost to the Dallas Cowboys by a score of 38–3.[145] In doing so, Belichick suffered the worst loss of his coaching career (35 points).[146] The following week, the Patriots lost to the Saints by a score of 34–0, giving Belichick his worst home loss of his career.[147] Two weeks later, New England upset the Buffalo Bills 29–25 to earn Belichick his 300th career regular season win as an NFL head coach.[148] After a Week 10 10–6 loss to the Indianapolis Colts in Germany and subsequent bye week, Belichick named Bailey Zappe the team's starting quarterback.[149] In Belichick's final game with New England, the Patriots lost to the New York Jets 17–3, snapping the team's 15-game winning streak over the Jets. The Patriots finished the season with a 4–13 record, the team's worst in Belichick's 24 seasons as head coach.[150] On January 11, 2024, Belichick and the Patriots mutually agreed to part ways.[151] On January 15, Belichick was interviewed by the Atlanta Falcons for their head coaching position, but ultimately did not get the job as the Falcons hired Raheem Morris instead.[152] Under Belichick, the Patriots had a regular-season record of 266–121–0 over 24 seasons.[153] Belichick is the most successful coach in Patriots history; his 266 wins with the franchise are more than quadruple those of runner-up Mike Holovak.[154] Belichick also compiled a 30–12 record in the playoffs with New England, including a 6–3 record in Super Bowls. He led the Patriots to 17 divisional titles, including five consecutive titles from 2003 to 2007 and eleven consecutive titles from 2009 to 2019. This streak of 11 consecutive playoff appearances is the most in NFL history for any team.[155] While still serving as head coach for the Patriots in 2019, Belichick appeared as one of three main analysts, alongside host Rich Eisen and Cris Collinsworth, for the NFL 100 All-Time Team series on NFL Network, serving as a voter, in addition to providing his analysis of each member's significance and breaking down tape of highlight plays. Belichick was chosen in these roles due to his exceptional knowledge of American football, to the extent that he and fellow former head coach John Madden were specifically assigned to look over film of the earliest players selected to the team.[156] Belichick was awarded a Sports Emmy in 2021 for his contributions to the series.[157] After mutually parting ways with the Patriots in 2024, Belichick, while still declaring himself an active head coach, officially agreed to appear every Monday afternoon during the 2024 NFL season with ESPN's The Pat McAfee Show, first appearing as an analyst on the show during its \"5th Annual Draft Spectacular\", covering the 2024 NFL draft, following a guest appearance weeks prior.[158][159] \"I can't tell you the advantage to having a defensive coach to take the quarterback behind the ropes on that defense, it made me a better quarterback, so Bill's gonna do that. I think the audience is going to be fascinated at how smart he is. Look, you guys saw how witty he is. I watched the Draft show you guys did; it was awesome. He's quick-witted, he's funny and like I said, he's brilliant when it comes to defense and offense, the guy can flat-out coach.\"[160] –Peyton Manning on Belichick as an analyst, May 2024 Peyton Manning revealed during the Netflix special The Roast of Tom Brady that Belichick would join another ESPN program, joining the Manning brothers (Peyton and Eli) in the Manningcast, an alternate live television broadcast of Monday Night Football.[161] A week afterward, Manning stated during an appearance on The Pat McAfee Show that Belichick would appear on every Manningcast broadcast during the 2024 season.[160] Coaching record accurate as of final week of the 2023 NFL season.[162] Bill Belichick has worked under six head coaches: Twenty of Belichick's assistant coaches have become NFL or NCAA head coaches (not including interim tenures): During the offseason, Belichick visits other football programs to learn from their experiences. For example, he has studied the Navy run offense, sought Bill Walsh (in past years) to understand more about the San Francisco 49ers as an organization and the West Coast offense as a system,[190] and spent time with Jimmy Johnson to learn about drafting and contract negotiations.[191] The track record of Belichick's coaching tree has been characterized as poor. Former assistant coaches under Belichick had a combined 208–296–1 (.413) record as head coaches of their own teams through November 28, 2020, and a number of them ended their brief tenures as head coaches by being fired midseason.[192] As of the end of the 2020 season, the only members of this coaching tree to have career NFL head coaching records above .500 were former coaches Groh (9–7) and O'Brien (52–48 during season, 2–4 in playoffs).[193] Nick Saban and Belichick are good friends. In 2007, when Belichick spoke about their relationship, he said: \"Two successful Croats in the same division of NFL. You must admit, you don't see that every day.\"[194] In May 2018, President Donald Trump appointed Belichick to be a member of his Council on Sports, Fitness & Nutrition.[195] Belichick has an Alaskan Klee Kai dog named Nike.[196] Interest in the breed surged after Nike made an appearance on camera during the 2020 NFL draft.[197] Belichick has dual Croatian/American citizenship.[198] He received Croatian citizenship on June 3, 2024, in Banski dvori in Zagreb from the Croatian prime minister Andrej Plenković.[199] He was also special guest of the association football friendly match on Stadion Rujevica between Croatia and North Macedonia.[200] Belichick was married to Debby Clarke from 1977 to 2006.[201][202] They have three children. Daughter Amanda played lacrosse at Wesleyan University. She is the head women's lacrosse coach at the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts in July 2015.[203] Son Stephen played lacrosse and football at Rutgers University, served as assistant coach with the Patriots, and is currently defensive coordinator for the University of Washington.[204] Son Brian is an assistant coach with the Patriots.[205] Starting in 2007, Belichick was in a relationship with Linda Holliday, the executive director of the Bill Belichick Foundation.[206][207] The relationship ended in 2023. In June 2024 it was reported that Belichick was in a relationship with Jordon Hudson, who is a 24-year-old former cheerleader.[208] On January 10, 2021, Politico reported then-President Donald Trump planned to award Belichick the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[209] Belichick indicated that he was flattered to be considered for the honor, but declined the award in a statement issued the next day.[210] His statement referenced the January 6 United States Capitol attack, which the House of Representatives had accused Trump of provoking when it impeached for the second time of his presidency, and cited Belichick's \"great reverence for our nation's values, freedom and democracy\" in light of that event.[211][212] A number of Massachusetts politicians, including Senator Ed Markey and Representative Jim McGovern, had previously called on him to decline after news of the award became public.[213] # denotes interim head coach # denotes de facto general manager # denotes interim head coach # denotes de facto general manager",

Hudson met the six-time Super Bowl champion on a flight where they discussed psychology, and they remained in touch with each other afterwards, before reportedly beginning dating sometime in 2022. \"[Belichick] couldn't care less about the age difference because he appreciates Jordon for the woman that she is,\" a source told PageSix.com. \"Jordon is an old soul so she and Bill connect on a deep level. \"Age is just a number to them.

Whilst he is listed as an active coach, he currently is not registered to any team and works as a pundit for FOX Sports and often collaborates with Pat McAfee. The 72-year-old recently made his red carpet debut with his beau as they attended The Museum Gala at New York City's American Museum of Natural History on December 5 and now an insider reports his passionate defense of her.

In 2018, Carter attended first grade at the Center for Early Education, a private school in West Hollywood, California.[20] Dubbed the \"New Princess of Pop\" by Rolling Stone, Carter was featured gurgling and crying on her father's single \"Glory\", a song released to celebrate her two days after her birth.[21][1] Because of \"Glory\", Carter is the youngest person to ever chart on the Billboard charts.[22][23] In 2015, Carter appeared as part of the choir on the Coldplay song \"Up&Up\" from their album A Head Full of Dreams.[24][25] In 2020, Carter sang on the track \"Brown Skin Girl\", earning accolades and awards for the performance. She was the youngest recipient of a BET Award when she received the BET Her Award.

Cherry's book Hair Love about an African American father doing his daughter's hair for the first time.[28][29] Variety posited \"there's a chance she could contend for a Grammy nomination for spoken word.\"[30] On January 21, 2023, Carter joined her mother onstage to sing \"Brown Skin Girl\" for the first time, as Beyoncé performed at a private show in Dubai.[31] Beginning May 26, 2023, Carter joined the Renaissance World Tour as a dancer and danced to \"My Power\" and \"Black Parade\" with her mother.[32] In 2012, Hvar, Croatia named Carter an honorary citizen. Before Carter's birth, her parents had visited the town, where Beyoncé had first considered naming her Blue Ivy.[33] In August 2014, Carter joined her father Jay-Z onstage at the MTV Video Music Awards, where they presented Beyoncé with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award.[34] Carter has continued to attend music award ceremonies with her parents, including the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards, where she made headlines for the cost of the clothing she wore.[35][36] In January 2020, just before Carter's eighth birthday, rapper Megan Thee Stallion posted photos to her Instagram and Twitter of her, Beyoncé, and Carter. Vanity Fair writer K. Austin Collins and Harper's Bazaar web editor Violet Lucca criticized Carter's physical appearance. Both apologized and deleted their posts after backlash.[37][38] In February 2012, a skit on Saturday Night Live depicted a baby Carter being serenaded by Bon Iver (played by Justin Timberlake).[39] In January 2013, a skit on the same series depicted Carter's crib, which was \"lined with one of Diana Ross's finest wigs\".[40] In 2018, Carter was the subject of an impersonation by drag queen The Vixen on the Snatch Game episode on Season 10 of RuPaul's Drag Race.

The \"Single Ladies\" singer is once again voicing the lion, Nala, in the follow-up movie to the 2019 live action remake of The Lion King. Her daughter Blue Ivy is making her feature film debut in Mufasa as Kiara, the daughter of Simba and Nala. The pair attended the movie's premiere on Monday night in gold gowns and Beyoncé later took to Instagram to praise Blue Ivy's performance. \"My gorgeous baby girl. This is your night. You worked hard and you did such a beautiful job as the voice of Kiara. Your family could not be prouder. Keep shining,\" Beyoncé captioned the post which has been liked 1.6 million times. Also attending the premiere was Beyoncé's husband and rapper, Jay-Z, and her mom, Tina Knowles. The group put on a united front on the red carpet at the premiere amid allegations of rape against Jay-Z— whose given name is Shawn Carter. A federal lawsuit was filed in October against his fellow rapper, Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, who is currently in custody awaiting trial on a number of criminal charges, including trafficking. Texas-based attorney Tony Buzbee filed the lawsuit in the Southern District of New York and amended it to include Carter as a defendant. The men are accused of raping a 13-year-old girl at a party after the MTV Video Music Awards in 2000. Carter filed a countersuit against Buzbee and released a statement on Sunday denying the suit's allegations. \"These allegations are so heinous in nature that I implore you to file a criminal complaint, not a civil one!! Whomever would commit such a crime against a minor should be locked away, would you not agree? These alleged victims would deserve real justice if that were the case,\" Carter stated and also accused Buzbee of \"blackmail.\" \"My heart and support goes out to true victims in the world, who have to watch how their life story is dressed in costume for profitability by this ambulance chaser in a cheap suit,\" Carter wrote. Buzbee responded to Carter's statement in a message to Newsweek. \"Mr. Carter previously denied being the one who sued me and my firm. He even filed his frivolous case under a pseudonym. What he fails to say in his recent statement is my firm sent his lawyer a demand letter on behalf of an alleged victim and that victim never demanded a penny from him. Instead, she only sought a confidential mediation,\" the lawyer said. \"Since I sent the letter on her behalf, Mr. Carter has not only sued me, but he has tried to bully and harass me and this plaintiff. His conduct has had the opposite impact. She is emboldened. I'm very proud of her resolve. As far as the allegations in the complaint filed today, we will let the filing speak for itself and will litigate the facts in court, not in the media,\" Buzbee added.

                "content": "Eric Marlon Bishop (born December 13, 1967),[2][3][4] known professionally as Jamie Foxx, is an American actor, comedian, and singer. He gained his career breakthrough as a featured player in the sketch comedy show In Living Color from 1991 to 1994. Following this success, he was given his own sitcom, The Jamie Foxx Show, in which he starred, co-created and produced from 1996 to 2001. Foxx received acclaim for his portrayal of Ray Charles in the film Ray (2004), winning the Academy Award for Best Actor. That same year, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in the crime film Collateral. He gained further prominence for his film roles in Ali (2001), Jarhead (2005), Dreamgirls (2006), Miami Vice (2006), Horrible Bosses (2011), Django Unchained (2012), Annie (2014), Baby Driver (2017), and Soul (2020). He also played Electro in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014) and Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) and Walter McMillian in Just Mercy (2019). Foxx also embarked on a successful career as an R&B singer in the 2000s. He earned two number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100, with his features on the singles \"Slow Jamz\" by Twista alongside Kanye West, and \"Gold Digger\" by the former. His single \"Blame It\" won him the Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. Four of his five studio albums have charted in the top ten of the U.S. Billboard 200: Unpredictable (2005), which topped the chart, Intuition (2008), Best Night of My Life (2010), and Hollywood: A Story of a Dozen Roses (2015). Since 2017, Foxx has served as the host and executive producer of the Fox game show Beat Shazam. In 2021, he wrote his autobiography Act Like You Got Some Sense. Born in Terrell, Texas,[5] Foxx is the son of Darrell Bishop (renamed Shahid Abdula following his conversion to Islam),[6] who sometimes worked as a stockbroker, and Louise Annette Talley Dixon. Shortly after his birth, Foxx was adopted and raised by his mother's adoptive parents, Esther[7] Marie (née Nelson), a domestic worker and nursery operator, and Mark Talley, a yard worker.[8][9] He has had little contact with his birth parents, who were not part of his upbringing.[10] He was raised in the black quarter of Terrell, which at the time was a racially segregated community.[10] He has often acknowledged his grandmother's influence as one of the greatest reasons for his success.[8][11] Foxx began playing the piano when he was five years old.[12] He had a strict Baptist upbringing[8][13] and as a teenager was a part-time pianist and choir leader in Terrell's New Hope Baptist Church.[10] His natural talent for telling jokes was already in evidence as a third grader, when his teacher used him as a reward: if the class behaved well, Foxx would tell them jokes. He attended Terrell High School, where he received top grades and played basketball and football (as quarterback). His ambition was to play for the Dallas Cowboys, and he was the first player in the school's history to pass for more than 1,000 yards.[10][14] He also sang in a band called Leather and Lace.[10] After high school, Foxx received a scholarship to United States International University, where he studied musical and performing arts composition.[10][15] Foxx first told jokes at a comedy club's open mic night in 1989, after accepting a girlfriend's dare. When he found that female comedians were often called first to perform, he chose the stage name of Jamie Foxx, which he felt was ambiguous enough to disallow any biases,[10][16] with his surname being a tribute to the black comedian Redd Foxx.[16] Foxx joined the cast of In Living Color in 1991, where his recurrent character Wanda also shared a name with Redd's friend and co-worker, LaWanda Page. Following a recurring role in the comedy-drama sitcom Roc,[17] Foxx went on to star in his own sitcom The Jamie Foxx Show, from 1996 to 2001, which he also co-created and produced through his company Foxx Hole Productions and was aired on the WB network. Foxx made his film debut in the 1992 comedy Toys. His first dramatic role came in Oliver Stone's 1999 film Any Given Sunday, where he was cast as a hard-partying quarterback,[8] partly because of his own football background.[8] During filming, Foxx fought with costar LL Cool J.[18][19] In 2001, Foxx starred opposite Will Smith in Michael Mann's biographical drama Ali. Three years later, Foxx played taxi driver Max Durocher in the Mann film Collateral alongside Tom Cruise, for which he received outstanding reviews. Critic Roger Ebert praised Foxx's performance, stating that, \"Jamie Foxx's work is a revelation. I've thought of him in terms of comedy (\"Booty Call,\" \"Breakin' all the Rules\"), but here he steps into a dramatic lead and is always convincing and involving\".[20] He went on to receive a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance.[8] In 1994, Foxx released an album (on the Fox record label) entitled Peep This, which was not commercially successful. In 2003, Foxx made a cameo in Benzino's music video for \"Would You\", which features LisaRaye McCoy and Mario Winans. In 2003, Foxx featured on the rapper Twista's song, \"Slow Jamz\", together with Kanye West, which reached No. 1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and #3 on the UK Singles chart. His second collaboration with Kanye West, \"Gold Digger,\" in which Foxx sang the Ray Charles-influenced \"I Got a Woman\" hook, then went straight to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, remaining there for 10 weeks. In 2005, Foxx featured on the single \"Georgia\" by Atlanta rappers Ludacris and Field Mob, which sampled Ray Charles' hit \"Georgia on My Mind\". Foxx would also portray Ray Charles in the biographical film Ray (2004), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor[8] and the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Foxx is the third male in history (after Barry Fitzgerald and Al Pacino) to receive two acting Oscar nominations in the same year for two different movies, Collateral and Ray. In 2005, Foxx was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[21] Foxx released his second studio album, Unpredictable, in December 2005. It debuted at No. 2, selling 598,000 copies in its first week,[22] rising to No. 1 the following week and selling an additional 200,000 copies.[23] To date, the album has sold 1.98 million copies in the United States, and was certified double Platinum by the RIAA.[24][25] The album also charted on the UK Albums Chart, where it peaked at No. 9.[26] Foxx became the fourth artist to have both won an Academy Award for an acting role and to have achieved a No. 1 album in the U.S, joining Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby and Barbra Streisand. Foxx's first single from the album, the title track \"Unpredictable\" (featuring Ludacris), peaked in the Billboard Hot 100 Top 10 singles and also made the UK Top 20 singles chart; the track samples \"Wildflower\" by New Birth. The second U.S. single from the album was \"DJ Play a Love Song,\" which reunited Foxx with Twista. In the UK, the second single was \"Extravaganza\", which saw Foxx once again collaborate with Kanye West, although Foxx did not feature in the song's music video. At the 2006 BET Awards, Foxx won Best Duet/Collaboration with Kanye West for \"Gold Digger\" and tied with Mary J. Blige's \"Be Without You\" for Video of the Year. On December 8, 2006, Foxx received four Grammy Award nominations, which included Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for Love Changes featuring Mary J. Blige, Best R&B Album for Unpredictable, Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for Georgia by Ludacris & Field Mob featuring Jamie Foxx, and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for Unpredictable featuring Ludacris. Following on from these successes, Foxx went on to appear in the box-office hits Jarhead, Miami Vice, and Dreamgirls, which lifted his profile even higher as a bankable star in Hollywood. 2007 brought him the lead role in the action thriller film The Kingdom opposite Chris Cooper, Jason Bateman, Jennifer Garner and Ashraf Barhom. In September 2007, Foxx was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: \"[it was] one of the most amazing days of my life,\" said Foxx.[27] In April 2009, Foxx played the lead role in the dramatic film The Soloist. A few months later in October 2009, he played a starring role alongside Gerard Butler in the thriller Law Abiding Citizen. In 2007, his company FoxxKing Entertainment signed deals with MTV and VH1.[28] Foxx released his third album titled Intuition in 2008, featuring Kanye West, T.I., Ne-Yo, Lil' Kim and T-Pain. The album's first single, \"Just Like Me\" featuring T.I., was promoted by a video directed by Brett Ratner which featured an appearance by actress Taraji P. Henson. The second single \"Blame It\" featured T-Pain and became a top 5 single on the Billboard Hot 100 and a number-one single on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The song received many accolades for Foxx, including a Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards. The \"Blame It\" music video, directed by Hype Williams, features cameo appearances by Forest Whitaker, Samuel L. Jackson, Ron Howard, Quincy Jones and his Jarhead co-star Jake Gyllenhaal, amongst others. Foxx's musical career has also included a number of collaborations. In 2007, he recorded the song \"She Goes All the Way\" with country superstars Rascal Flatts for their Still Feels Good album. Foxx performed backing vocals for artist/songwriter Tank. He featured alongside The-Dream on Plies' \"Please Excuse My Hands.\" He also appeared alongside Fabolous on the remix of Ne-Yo's \"Miss Independent\". Foxx collaborated with rapper The Game on the track \"Around the World\". Foxx also featured on T.I.'s single \"Live in the Sky\" from the album King. On January 22, 2007, Foxx launched The Foxxhole, a channel on Sirius Satellite Radio featuring talk-radio programs, stand-up comedy albums and music primarily by African-American performers, as well as much of Foxx's own material. Foxx's own talk-radio variety program The Jamie Foxx Show airs Friday evenings on The Foxxhole with guests including musicians, actors and fellow comedians; co-hosts have included Johnny Mack, Speedy, Claudia Jordan, The Poetess, Lewis Dix, Yvette Wilson, T.D.P and Tyrin Turner. On the April 17, 2009, episode of The Jamie Foxx Show, Foxx and his co-hosts made several sexually suggestive and disparaging jokes regarding the teenage singer Miley Cyrus.[29] Several days later Foxx issued a public apology on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in response to growing public outcry and televised criticism by Cyrus's father, country singer Billy Ray Cyrus.[30] On April 6, 2009, Foxx, a longtime fan of country music, performed the George Strait song \"You Look So Good in Love\" at the George Strait Artist of the Decade All-Star Concert. Jamie Foxx hosted the 2009 BET Awards ceremony on June 28, 2009, which featured several tributes to pop star Michael Jackson, who had died three days prior to the show. As well as performing \"Blame It\" with T-Pain and \"She Got Her Own\" with Ne-Yo and Fabolous, Foxx opened the show with a rendition of Jackson's \"Beat It\" dance routine and closed the show with a cover of the Jackson 5's \"I'll Be There\" with Ne-Yo. \"We want to celebrate this black man. He belongs to us and we shared him with everybody else.\", said Foxx during the ceremony. In April 2011, Foxx voiced the cartoon canary Nico in the movie Rio. During the summer of 2011, Foxx was involved as a producer of In the Flow with Affion Crockett on Fox.[31] Foxx released his fourth album, Best Night of My Life, on December 21, 2010,[32] featuring the singles \"Winner\" (featuring Justin Timberlake and T.I.), \"Living Better Now\" (featuring rapper Rick Ross) and \"Fall for Your Type\" (featuring rapper Drake).[32] On October 7, the RCA Music Group announced that it was disbanding J Records along with Arista Records and Jive Records, meaning that all artists (including Foxx) previously signed to the three labels will release their future material on the RCA Records brand.[33][34] In 2011, Jamie Foxx also featured on the rapper Pitbull's album Planet Pit, in the song \"Where Do We Go\". In 2012, Foxx starred in the title role of the Quentin Tarantino written and directed Django Unchained.[35] Foxx starred alongside his Ray co-star Kerry Washington, as well as Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson. In an interview about Django Unchained, Foxx told Vibe magazine: \"As a black person it's always racial. ... when I get home my other homies are like how was your day? Well, I only had to be white for at least eight hours today, [or] I only had to be white for four hours.\"[36] The filming was emotional as Foxx said, \"It's tough shooting when you're in plantation row and that's where your ancestors were persecuted and killed.\"[37] On November 25, 2012, at BET's Soul Train Awards, Foxx joked: \"It's like church in here. First of all, giving honor to God and our lord and savior Barack Obama.\"[38] The joke led to condemnation from some Christians, to which Foxx responded: \"I'm a comic [and] sometimes I think people get a little too tight.\"[39] While hosting Saturday Night Live on December 8, 2012, to promote Django Unchained, Foxx joked about being excited \"to kill all the white people in the movie\".[40] Appearing at the 2013 NAACP Image Awards, Foxx praised the achievements of black people, saying that \"black people are the most talented people in the world\".[41] In 2013, Foxx was cast as President James Sawyer in White House Down alongside Channing Tatum.[42] The following year, Foxx appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 as the villain Electro, and co-starred with Quvenzhané Wallis in Annie, Sony's Will Smith and Jay-Z produced update of the comic strip-turned-musical.[43] In 2017, Foxx starred as Bats, a trigger-happy gang member, in Edgar Wright's action film Baby Driver. Foxx's October 2014 Deja Vu duet with Dionne Warwick appears on the Feels So Good album released by Warwick. He released his fifth studio album, Hollywood: A Story of a Dozen Roses, on May 18, 2015. It debuted atop the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts and at No. 10 on the Billboard 200.[44] In 2015, Foxx's voice was featured in the chorus on the Ariana Grande song, \"Focus\".[45] Since its debut in 2017, Foxx has been the host and executive producer of the Fox game show Beat Shazam, whose premise is similar to the once-popular game show format Name That Tune. On the show, three sets of two partners try to beat the software application Shazam in correctly identifying the titles of popular songs for increasingly higher amounts of money, with one team eventually vying for a potential prize of $1 million. Foxx's daughter Corinne began co-hosting the show in its second season in 2018, replacing DJ October Gonzalez.[46] The show has aired four seasons so far.[47] Foxx co-executive produced the 2017 Showtime sitcom White Famous, which starred Jay Pharoah as a young aspiring African-American comic, and was based on Foxx's own early career. Foxx also occasionally appeared on the show as himself. White Famous got middling reviews and ratings, and was cancelled after one season.[48] On May 22, 2019, Foxx appeared as George Jefferson in Live in Front of a Studio Audience: Norman Lear's All in the Family and The Jeffersons on ABC.[49] That year, he played wrongly convicted death row prisoner Walter McMillian in the drama film Just Mercy, for which he received significant critical acclaim.[50] Foxx starred in Project Power, directed by Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost, opposite Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Dominique Fishback, which was released on August 14, 2020, by Netflix.[51][52] That September, Foxx signed an overall deal with Sony Pictures Entertainment.[53] Foxx then voiced the main character, jazz pianist and music teacher Joe Gardner, in the Pixar animated film Soul (2020).[54] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Soul was released direct-to-streaming on Disney+ in most countries, including the United States,[55] though it did get a theatrical release in some countries.[56][57] USA Today's Brian Truitt commended Foxx's performance, saying he brought \"warmth, humor and an occasional touch of exasperation\" to the role.[58] Foxx co-created, executive produced and starred in the 2021 Netflix sitcom Dad Stop Embarrassing Me!, in which he played the single father of two teenage girls. The series marked Foxx's return to the sitcom format after The Jamie Foxx Show ended in 2001.[59] The entire eight-episode series premiered April 14, 2021, on Netflix. It was cancelled after one season.[60] He reprised his role as Electro in Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021), set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.[61] In 2021, Foxx released the memoir Act Like You Got Some Sense: And Other Things My Daughters Taught Me, which focused on his family life, both as a child and as an adult.[62] On May 29, 2018, Foxx was cast as Al Simmons in King Spawn, to be directed by Todd McFarlane.[63] In 2015, Foxx became attached to portray former boxer Mike Tyson in a biographical drama film Finding Mike; in 2020, he began to exercise in order to gain muscle for the role.[64] In 2021, the project turned into a miniseries, to be directed by Antoine Fuqua.[65] Foxx has two daughters: model, actress, and television producer Corinne Foxx, born in 1994;[10] and another daughter born in 2009.[66] Corinne made her formal debut at the Bal des débutantes in November 2014 and was named Miss Golden Globe 2016 on November 18, 2015.[67] In 2008, Foxx filmed a public service announcement for Do Something to promote food drives in local communities.[68] From 2013 to 2019, Foxx was rumored to be in a relationship with actress Katie Holmes.[69][70] On January 18, 2016, he rescued a young man from a burning vehicle that crashed outside his home. The driver, Brett Kyle, was driving his truck \"at a high rate of speed\" when it left the road, traveled into a drainage ditch, and rolled over several times. Kyle was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol.[71][72] On October 26, 2020, Foxx announced that his sister Deondra Dixon had died. She was 36 years old and had been born with Down syndrome. She had been an ambassador for the Global Down Syndrome Foundation.[73] On April 12, 2023, his daughter Corinne announced that he had been hospitalized after an unspecified medical emergency, but was recovering.[74][75] On May 12, amid conflicting reports about the nature of his condition, including rumors that he was gravely ill, Corinne said that her father had been \"out of the hospital for weeks, recuperating\".[76] He was reportedly treated in a \"physical rehab facility in Chicago\" that specializes in \"strokes and brain injuries\".[77] On July 22, Foxx posted a video clip commenting about his health, saying that he had been to \"hell and back\".[78][79][80] On December 3, 2023, he made his first public appearance since the hospitalization, to accept a Critics Choice Association's Vanguard Award. In his speech, he disclosed that he couldn't walk at first and discussed his recovery, without detailing exactly what led to his hospitalization.[81] Despite the news of his health challenges, he walked his daughter Corinne down the aisle in September 21, 2024 at his home in Thousand Oaks, California.[82][83] On December 10, 2024, Foxx revealed that he had a stroke that led to his hospitalization in April 2023 in his Netflix comedy special, Jamie Foxx: What Had Happened Was....[84] In April 2003, Foxx and his sister Deondra Dixon were confronted by security guards and had a physical struggle with police officers who arrested them at Harrah's casino in New Orleans.

A trailer was released at the event, which featured segments from each of the episodes.[1][7] The pilot who features in the Armored Core episode was the subject of media attention and speculation due to his resemblance to actor Keanu Reeves.[8][9] Though Prime Video declined to disclose casting information at the time of the announcement, ComicBook.com reported an influx of \"nearly nothing but replies about Reeves and his potential appearance in [the series]\" under a post by Armored Core's social media account.[10] IGN's Wesley Yin-Poole said that were it not really Reeves, the actor could claim a royalty payment due to the certainty of the character's likeness to his.[11] GamesRadar+'s Ali Jones remarked that while the shot could have been \"simply be an ethnically ambiguous man with similar facial hair\", they noted the likeness, and doubted that Armored Core would place the image so prominently on their social media account if it were \"just some random actor\" and not Reeves.[12] In October 2024 Reeves's casting was officially revealed alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Kevin Hart, Heaven Hart, Gabriel Luna, Ariana Greenblatt, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Michael Beach, Emily Swallow, and Claudia Doumit.[6] The series premiered worldwide on December 10, 2024.[13] Half of the episodes were released for the premiere, and the other half releases on December 17, 2024.[6] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Secret Level has an approval rating of 67% based on 12 reviews, with an average rating of 6.0/10.[14] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 50 out of 100 based on 8 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[15]",

                "content": "Taylor Lorenz is an American journalist who writes the Substack publication \"User Mag\". She was previously a columnist for The Washington Post, a technology reporter for The New York Times, The Daily Beast, and Business Insider, and social media editor for the Daily Mail. She is particularly known for covering Internet culture. In 2023, she published a book called Extremely Online: The Untold Story of Fame, Influence, and Power on the Internet. In 2024, she was a podcaster for Vox Media, hosting a show called Power User. Lorenz was born in New York City[1] and grew up in Old Greenwich, Connecticut, attending nearby Greenwich High School.[2] She attended college at the University of Colorado Boulder and later transferred to Hobart and William Smith Colleges, where she graduated with a degree in political science.[3][4] Lorenz has said that the social media site Tumblr caused her to become interested in Internet culture.[5] According to The Caret, Lorenz's reporting frequently concerns \"Silicon Valley venture capitalists, marketers and ... anyone curious about how the internet is shaping the ways in which humans express themselves and communicate\".[6] Fortune named her to its \"40 Under 40\" list in 2020, saying that she has \"cemented herself as a peerless authority\" whose name became \"synonymous with youth culture online\" during her time at The Daily Beast and The Atlantic.[7] The same year, Adweek included her on its list of \"Young Influentials Who Are Shaping Media, Marketing and Tech\", saying that she \"contextualizes the internet as we live it\".[8] Reason magazine credited her with popularizing the term \"OK boomer\" in a story declaring \"the end of friendly generational relations\".[9] According to TheWrap, \"since her time at the Times, she's attracted an inordinate amount of online criticism, particularly from those in the right-wing media\".[10] Lorenz worked as a social media editor for the Daily Mail from 2011 to 2014, becoming its head of social media.[11] After a short stint writing for The Daily Dot in 2014,[12] she was a technology reporter for Business Insider from 2014 to 2017.[13] In 2017, she wrote briefly for The Hill's blog section,[14][15] and was assaulted by a counter-protester[16] while covering the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.[17] From 2017 to 2018, she worked as a technology reporter for The Daily Beast.[18] In 2019, she was a visiting fellow at Harvard University's Nieman Foundation for Journalism.[19] From 2019 to 2022, she was a technology reporter for The New York Times.[20] In March 2022, Lorenz left the Times and joined The Washington Post as a columnist.[3][21] In April 2022, Lorenz wrote an article for the Post that publicized the identity of Chaya Raichik as the owner of the far-right Twitter account Libs of TikTok. The details were retrieved from early iterations of the account[22] as well as previous reporting.[23] In attempt to discredit the article and Lorenz herself,[23][24] Raichik attacked Lorenz, claiming that Lorenz doxxed her.[25][26] According to The Times of London, \"supporters of Lorenz meanwhile pointed out that Raichik's followers were only too enthusiastic about doxing when it came to teachers being smeared as paedophiles\".[27] In a tweet, Lorenz said that her \"whole family was doxed again this morning ... trolls have now moved on to doxing and stalking any random friends I've tagged on Instagram\".[28] Lorenz later interviewed Raichik for an article about Libs of TikTok in February 2024.[29] In June 2022, the Post published an article by Lorenz about the eco-system of online content creators and influencers covering the Depp v. Heard trial. The article incorrectly said that two YouTubers mentioned in passing in the article had been contacted for comment, when the Post later reported that only one had been before publication,[30] though this is disputed by both YouTubers.[31] Ultimately, after editorial corrections were made, the Editor's Note on the article acknowledged that only one of the creators had been contacted before publication, and that stealth editing had occurred against the paper's policy, however Lorenz did not make the stealth edit. In a tweet thread agreed upon by Lorenz, her editors, and Post management, Lorenz stated that the errors were due to a miscommunication with her editor.[10][32][33] In August 2024, The Washington Post began an internal investigation for evidence of bias after Lorenz shared an image on a private Instagram story depicting President Joe Biden with the caption \"war criminal :(\", referencing a meme.[34] Lorenz initially denied making the post, and later said that a friend created the captioned picture, which Lorenz shared. According to NPR, four people with direct knowledge of the post confirmed its authenticity.[35] Lorenz never published another article for The Post, which did not announce its findings, and in October 2024, left the paper to focus on her own ventures.[36][34] In February 2024, it was announced that Lorenz would be launching a podcast with Vox Media called Power User.[37] In December 2024, it was announced that her distribution partnership would not be renewed.[38] Lorenz left The Washington Post in October 2024 to start her own Substack publication called \"User Mag\". Substack co-founder Hamish McKenzie told The Hollywood Reporter that she is an \"accomplished reporter with deep experience covering internet trends and culture\" whom the platform thinks \"will thrive...with the direct support of her audience.\"[39] In October 2023, her book Extremely Online: The Untold Story of Fame, Influence, and Power on the Internet was published by Simon & Schuster.[40] Lorenz has been the subject of online harassment, often used as a tactic to attempt to discredit her reporting and skills as a journalist.[24] The harassment has included graphic rape threats, death threats, and even threats against her parents and other family members, some of them children.[41] Some of the harassment that has targeted Lorenz has been coordinated, often boosted by right wing media personalities, such as Tucker Carlson.[42][43] The online harassment has spilled over into the physical world as well. Lorenz has been stalked,[24] and in 2022 \"a man who had been live-streaming violent threats about her turned up,\" at a conference she was speaking at, necessitating her to \"be escorted to safety\".[44] Furthermore, both she and her parents have been the victims of swatting.[44] In December 2022, Twitter owner Elon Musk temporarily suspended Lorenz's Twitter account, with Musk tweeting that the suspension was for \"prior doxxing action\".[45] Lorenz said she was suspended after asking Musk for comment on a story. The suspension followed a series of suspensions of journalists under Musk's new ownership of Twitter.[46] Lorenz announced her engagement to Christopher Mims, a technology columnist at The Wall Street Journal, in January 2015.[47] She identified herself as a vegan in 2022.[48] She has said in interviews that she is immunocompromised.[49]",

                "content": "Welcome to the Urgent Futures podcast! This podcast tries to clarify the chaos, from culture to the cosmos. Each episode, I sit down with leading thinkers for big idea dialogues about the research, concepts, and questions that animate their approaches to reality. 🎥 YouTube: 🎧 Apple Podcasts | Spotify Taylor Lorenz is a technology columnist for The Washington Post's business section covering online culture and the content creator industry. She was previously a technology reporter for The New York Times business section, The Atlantic, and The Daily Beast. Her writing has appeared in New York magazine, Rolling Stone, Outside magazine, and more. She frequently appears on NBC, CNN, MSNBC, CBS, and the BBC. She was a 2019 Knight Visiting Nieman Fellow at Harvard University and is a former affiliate at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society. More bio information can be found here. Taylor's work hits one of the main goals I have in doing a podcast in the first place. I started Reality Studies because, over the past few years, I realized that a lot of us were asking variations of the same question: What happened to reality? And of course follow-ups of how and why did it get so weird? Are we living in a simulation? So I started researching these questions and even if I wasn't going to be able to answer them I wanted deeper context for them. I've written about some of the fruits of this research in the newsletter, but the podcast is a place to spotlight the folks who are doing the critical work of identifying and translating cultural shifts. Taylor epitomizes this. For years, she's been finding the niche corners of the internet and tech culture that the rest of mainstream media isn't taking seriously or outright dismissing. Her stories have documented how the commodification of attention has brought about new power structures, new economies, new creative ecosystems, new celebrities, and her book, Extremely Online, is out next week (Oct. 3). With Extremely Online, Taylor looks back more than 20 years to the early aughts to the days when bloggers first began to reshape our understandings of media, all the way through the present moment, when TikTok has become a medium for activists and political speech. Like her reporting, the book sidesteps the conventional hero narratives of Silicon Valley giants, instead foregrounding the stories of platform users and lesser-known innovators whose contributions have had deep impacts on our lives—which are now, of course, extremely online. Jesse Damiani: Taylor, thank you for being on the Reality Studies Podcast. Taylor Lorenz: Thanks for having me. JD: I'm really excited to talk about Extremely Online with you today. And the first thing that comes to mind with this book is a structural question. The history unfolds across a series of precedents that seem kind of obvious in hindsight—like the fact that YouTubers would need agents and security and sort of be treated like regular celebrities—but that wasn't necessarily clear early in the trajectory of creator culture. So these were like social experiments that were occurring in real time. What have you learned about creator culture in mapping these precedent-setting moments? TL: Yeah, well, one thing I learned is that the media is always kind of wrong and behind. It was funny to go back and read mainstream media news articles about the Internet and, literally I would say for the past 25 years they have downplayed it and minimized it every step of the way—not even just about creator culture but sort of everything and it was just interesting to reread it and just be like, God, time and time again, they keep getting it wrong, or they misread why something is compelling. I found actually that the most useful kind of coverage of that industry when I was doing my research was just not the mainstream media, it was more like blogs or some digital media and just kind of individual people that just wrote a lot about the times. It was interesting also how the industry evolved; it used to be very platform-specific. I write about this in the book, but, after Vine died, you see this era of multi-platform creators. So it's just interesting how one little event could have ripple effects across the industry. JD: My first real entry into social media was MySpace—and when I was reading this and seeing the different waves and the different ways that different companies either succeeded or didn't, I wondered: do you think these events were preordained to happen the way that they did? Or were they the type of things that were just circumstantial and we could have lived in a world where MySpace would have been the main player in the social media game? TL: I think, you know, so much of it’s about timing. I think MySpace was so ahead of its time. This is another trend that I saw in writing is that there were these people who were so early, and actually saw the future before anybody else. I think MySpace's vision of the future and how they talked about entertainment and media is 100% basically the way TikTok talks about it now—MySpace had MySpace TV but it was still very web-based back then. They were thinking about social media how it would be thought about in 15 years, but they were trying to build it at this time when being online itself was still very stigmatized and weird and people didn't necessarily want to add a lot of friends online; that wasn’t the norm yet outside of teenagers and people our age who thought it was cool. The technology itself and the social norms had to change for the right products to take off. I would say it’s 50% right place-right time, because there were a lot of people I think would’ve been very successful if they had just been a little bit later. JD: One thing that we take for granted now is this (very contested) notion of cancel culture, but you referenced this early moment from 2002 with the ‘Internet's First Scalp.’ I'd love if you could share what happened there and what you see it communicating about this clash between old and new media formats. TL: Yeah, I talk about Josh Marshall, who was an early political blogger. He worked at the American Prospect by day, but he would blog by night at Talking Points Memo, which is now actually his independent media company. It was a birthday party for Strom Thurmond. There was a toast given by Senate Majority Leader at the time, Trent Lott, who basically made a bunch of praise for some of the worst of Strom Thurmond's ideologies and seemed to support segregation. And this was something that went over the heads of a lot of inside political writers in the mainstream media, who kind of ignored those comments and just wrote a quick item about the birthday celebration. But Josh noticed that comment, he pulled it out, and he did what bloggers do best, which is do like 20 posts on it, and relentlessly cover it until Trent Lott was forced to resign. The New York Post ran a headline that was titled, “The Internet’s First Scalp,” and it was about how people on the Internet, specifically bloggers and Josh Marshall were able to get Trent Lott kicked out of office. There were so many examples of things like this, actually, I really just liked that headline—and because it affected our entire political landscape. But you saw these little moments time and time again of the insurgent power of people online to have real meaningful change and to circumvent the mainstream media and up-end politics, fashion, sports, you name it. JD: This history really looks at the past two decades, and this period is this crucible in which social media is forged. There are countless instances where the “old guard” has totally dismissed or tried to bypass social media platforms and practices. Toward the end of the book, for example, you reference venture capitalists trying to use their positions with startups like Clubhouse to burnish their own brands as influencers, but then Clubhouse didn't necessarily find the success that they were hoping for. Has this dynamic just repeated itself again and again, or have you found that the old guard ever gets savvier? TL: Yeah, it's very funny because I think venture capitalists learn that you cannot force specific people to be popular on your platform, which Elon is learning today. You can try to force-feed these people down other people's throats and you're going to lose users that way. Clubhouse found that out the hard way. My book ends a couple years into the pandemic, that's when everyone was really forced, obviously, to all be extremely online, and that's when a lot of institutional powers were forced to take it seriously, because suddenly everyone was online. And they were like, “Wait a minute, what's happening over here? This world we've ignored for literally 20 years…maybe there's something here.” So you saw VCs pour money into the dumbest startups alive, to be honest, because they had ignored it for decades, and then they were funding things that nobody wanted or needed—also there's already this robust half a trillion dollar industry that they just ignored. I was talking to a friend of mine who's a VC, and she read the book as well, and she's like, “Not all VCs,” and it's true, like The Chernin Group invested in Barstool Sports early and a bunch of other creator-driven media companies—but they're not generally the Silicon Valley tech VCs, who are notorious for coming in at the last minute and trying to make money off something they have no idea about. I think they’re all in AI world right now. So it was just kind of funny to see they had missed the boat on that so badly, because the ones that did get into it in 2010, or even 2007, and recognized this stuff early, they made a lot of money. In terms of traditional media: I work in traditional media and I can tell you they absolutely do not get it at all. I think they've tried a little bit more and they recognize that they have to use the internet. There are people within these institutions that are brilliant and amazing; it's not really the workers, it's the management that sort of is just very slow to sort of grasp that it’s not the nineties and they don't control the media. The media is the internet now. The media is not the New York Times and The Washington Post—for good or bad. There's a lot of pluses and minuses to that. [MySpace was] thinking about social media how it would be thought about in 15 years, but they were trying to build it at this time when being online itself was still very stigmatized and weird … a lot of people I think would’ve been very successful if they had just been a little bit later. JD: Would you be willing to share a little bit more about like, you're somebody who kind of dances across both of these worlds, like, when you're thinking about your work of covering creator culture, and in some ways, sort of adopting creator tactics, while also being somebody who's a columnist at, I mean, your pedigree is all these major media organizations. How are you thinking about that, that balance? TL: Yeah, I am very much from the internet and I always sort of care about the internet more than I care about traditional media. But working in traditional media has been so interesting, because I've really seen why they can’t catch up. I used to write a lot of really negative things about the mainstream media when I was a blogger, and now that I work in it, I have a lot more empathy for it, for the people inside of it. Again, it's generally not the reporters. It's this management level; it's the same as in Congress. Our whole country is like run by this gerontocracy that refuses to give up power and is not with the times, and that's true for media, it's true for politics, it's true for literally name any industry—so I think there has to be some turnover before anything really changes. JD: So you referenced blogging. One thing I was really struck by early in the book that I maybe peripherally understood, but you bring into focus, is the impact of “mommy bloggers.” Your book is chronicling the commoditization of attention as power and mommy bloggers are this first kind of, I don't know, flashpoint in that trajectory. Could you share a little bit about the role that mommy bloggers have played? TL: Yeah, I would say they were like literal mothers to this whole industry. It's kind of crazy. I think a lot of people think of the creator industry as like YouTubers, or beginning with YouTubers, and that's not true. It really began with bloggers and specifically mommy bloggers, because mommy bloggers—which itself is this very fraught term that some women came to embrace and a lot of other women felt was deeply misogynistic—they dealt with so much misogyny and hate for what they were doing. But as I mentioned, there were these other bloggers, especially in tech and politics, that were getting lauded and able to get attention online, people like Josh Marshall. And then you had moms, a lot of mothers, basically a whole generation of Gen X mothers that were shut out of the workplace and turned to blogging to express themselves. They were the first to build a personal brand online and then monetize it. And they were just brutalized for it. People were just so angry that mothers would make money online. It was like this notion that motherhood was so sacred and like, ‘How could you monetize your life as a mother?’ They were attacked as being attention seekers. Like, ‘Why do you have to blog about your life?’ You know, ‘Why aren't you just happy at home? You should be cooking for your children, why are you on the Internet?’ The thing is, the Internet was such a lifeline for these mothers because motherhood is incredibly isolating and women's media at the time was deeply misogynist. I went back and read so much women's media from the ‘90s and Aughts for this book and it was just disgusting. It's actually like bizarre; stuff from 2005 reads like it’s from the 1950s. Mommy bloggers were the ones that normalized things like postpartum depression, and, you know, not always loving your kids, and just having a hard time, struggling, coping with addiction, turning to wine during playtime to make it through, hating your husband—just all these taboo topics that had never really been expressed in traditional media, mothers were able to go online and talk about and then make money, supporting themselves through it. So it was just really liberating and fascinating. JD: And you reference some highly visible misogynistic moments, like with Julia Allison and other women throughout the book, which is a parallel stream to women and femmes being the ones who often were the innovators of particular cultural and social practices. Can you talk a little bit more about that dynamic? TL: Yeah, this whole industry was built primarily by women and then secondarily other people that were basically marginalized, a lot of LGBTQ people, people of color, just people that would have never ended up in mainstream media. That's who fostered this whole blogging ecosystem and then really used the Internet very early to monetize. I don't get it into it in my book because it was so niche and separate from this main industry, but sex workers were also really early adopters of the internet and online monetization. I talk about that later with OnlyFans, which I think was the first true creator-driven sex work platform. But yeah, it was just all women and people were obviously livid at it because I think since the beginning there's just been this deep misogyny against women and women's work and women's role in society. JD: You also brought up BIPOC creators; 2020 was this big year of reckoning around systemic oppression broadly, but within the creator subsection it was also a moment of reckoning around people of color being exploited and extracted from in social media platforms. Could you A) describe that for listeners, and then B) I'm curious what you've observed, you know, it's been three years now, what movement or not you’ve seen on that front? TL: Throughout the Aughts and 2010s, you had a lot of viral moments coming from people of color, I talk about Tay Zonday, Adam Bahner, in my book, who wrote the “Chocolate Rain” song, and there's Peaches Monroee, who created the phrase “on fleek,” and so many vines specifically, there was just a lot of obviously, culture, created from those communities. And then in 2020, obviously, there was this big reckoning and people started to talk about credit and ownership. I talk about Jalaiah Harmon, who made the “Renegade” dance, who was a story that I wrote about this 14 year old that made one of the biggest dances on the internet and also never got credit until we wrote the story for the New York Times, basically. And so, there was this moment when people started to go like, “Oh, actually we should pay these people.” Unfortunately, as with every other bit of progress that was made in 2020, it flipped back very hard the other way. And now almost no one cares—there’s no discussion of it at brands. I saw a chart released by some company recently where they show spending on creators of color has gone down from pre-2020 levels. So they're in sort of a worse position than they were previously. I think unfortunately that's just the case with all the social progress that was made in 2020. I've talked to people about why this is, and it’s because, for so many reasons, but there was no sustained pressure. Nobody wanted to make systemic change. A lot of people wanted to talk about it because it was trendy at the time, but nobody actually wanted to change the system. So we have a worse system now, which sucks. The reason I end the book where I do, which is in 2022-ish, is because I think that was the end of a certain chapter of social media. JD: Related to that, another thing that really emerged in 2020 was TikTok as a vector for political communication, both from politicians externally, but more predominantly people spreading political messaging and fostering information ecosystems. When you bring up progress, how are you feeling as we're heading into another election year, with TikTok as strong as it ever was and more vehicles for video-based messaging? TL: TikTok has always been such a really important platform for activism and activists, especially youth activism, young people who want social change have leveraged TikTok very effectively. I think that's why you see all these Republicans embracing it—Vivek Ramaswamy was out with Jake Paul on TikTok the other day—so it's just going to play a bigger and bigger role in our political system because it's the default social network for millions of young people. I always describe TikTok as a combination of Twitter and YouTube, where there was all this like academia and like political discussion and actually a lot of smart people and journalists and stuff. Actually, not as many journalists as Twitter, but you know, there's enough like media on there—and then also with YouTube culture where it's very video based. Commentary culture is really huge on TikTok. So I think it’s just going to play a bigger and bigger role in our election cycles. Not the platform itself. People like to think that it's being programmed by China or something. It's not, or there's absolutely no evidence of that. I just mean people leveraging the platform, activists and people leveraging the platform to get the word out about whatever they're trying to talk about. JD: So this is not in the book, but, just to piggyback off that question, because I've seen you speak about this elsewhere and I'd love to discuss it with you. There's a lot of geopolitical positioning around TikTok in particular. What do you make of that relative to the sort of Western tech giants? Yeah, it's so hilarious to listen to these people talk about TikTok as if it's the greatest threat when we have Facebook here in our own country. They're worried that TikTok could potentially, you know, disrupt an election, when we have actual evidence that Facebook has done that many, many times. They're worried that Tiktok could like, lead people to violence when we have so many examples of Facebook facilitating genocide in other countries. It's like all of the stuff that they're accusing that TikTok might do, that there's no evidence TikTok has actually done or facilitated, we have overwhelming with so many examples of Facebook actually doing those things and actually facilitating those things. So it's just like, ‘Oh, but it's fine because it's America.” Also, by the way, the whole data privacy thing is such a farce. If they cared about data privacy, they would pass comprehensive data privacy reform. But if you shut down TikTok tomorrow, first of all there's still so many other Chinese apps and gaming, which is the bigger form of entertainment than anything else and is like half-owned by Chinese companies. So I can't even get into that, but like, also: China could buy our data from a third-party Facebook vendor. We have no data privacy. So if you're actually caring about data privacy to the extent that you want to shut down an app, make such an unprecedented decision, then you should actually pass a lot more comprehensive data privacy reform before anything like that ever even happens. But of course, they don't want to do that. They just want to make a political bogeyman. And it is this place for young progressive activism, that's why you see the Republicans and right-wing parties wanting to shut it down, because it's a place where young people congregate and push a lot of progressive ideology. JD: You prompted me to think about that report from the Wall Street Journal about Facebook knowing that Instagram was detrimental to adolescent women's mental health. And mental health comes up in Extremely Online as well, with this metrics game-the-algorithm culture, which I think would have felt really foreign if you'd rewound to the nineties and talked to the techno-utopians and said, “People are going to feel so strung out because they're running on this hamster wheel, and that's one of the primary effects of these platforms.” Could you share a little bit about, some of what's happened relative to mental health on these platforms and among creator communities? TL: These platforms basically put their creators, as you said, on a treadmill. There's no off-ramp. Being a creator is incredibly, incredibly difficult and there's almost no respect for it. There's no like institutional respect in the sense that we don't have a social safety net in this country at all. So these, these people are essentially independent contractors for these companies, but they have no benefits. They have no support. They can't take a week off without losing followers, losing money. So it's a very hard job. And it of course affects mental health and social media. I think making metrics public was the original sin of social media. It's so negative because it puts this social pressure on everyone to like, make sure you get that extra like, or make sure you get an extra hit, a certain follower numbers, because that says something about your social value. It's just very toxic. And I don't think that the Internet is inherently toxic, or the fact that it facilitates connection, the notion of social technology, I think is not toxic. We should be more connected. I hate this idea of like, “Oh, you just have to log off and the more you log off, the more mentally healthy you are.” I think you can spend literally 24/7 online. It's just that the way that we use the Internet and most of the platforms that we're forced to rely on right now are these really predatory ones. I wish that wasn't the case, I wish we had a much better social media landscape. But I hate that the the focus is on logging off. It's like, don't tell everyone to stop logging on. Tell everyone to like, let's build better systems to facilitate better connection. Because people's lives aren't inherently better when they log off either. JD: Yeah, it's often discounted that this is a whole architecture of power. It's a driver of the entire global economy now. And you sort of make the point, like, even if you're not part of any, platform you'll still be in other people's photos, your footprint is still traveling around these platforms. I'd love to talk a little bit about fandom with you. It's funny for me as a millennial, I feel like I grew up with all these platforms, and I had varying degrees of connection to them and to what was going on. I saw this stuff happening in the background, but it was kind of in the background of my everyday life. One service that I think this book provides is it really contextualizes things and gives you this 20 year history with the flashpoint moments to engage with. One thread that I saw evolving throughout is this idea of fandom. Can you describe how you've seen fandom evolve and maybe some moments, like some of the tours, that rendered visible how different, creator culture was? Or rather, how much more social capital being a creator had than people originally realized? TL: Creators were building these fandoms online, but they were very segregated to the internet, right? People that didn't spend time online could sort of write it off, they didn't have visibility into those fandoms because they weren't spending time online. They didn't see it. So once things started to really manifest in the real world was when people started to notice. I talk about this early Vine meet up, that a bunch of Vine creators had in Central Park, and that being kind of a moment. It used to be creators meeting up with each other. There were things like the 777 Meetup on July 7th, 2007 in Washington Square Park, where a bunch of YouTubers met up. But at that time, like in, I would say 2010 and earlier, it was more about like YouTubers meeting up with each other. Even the first VidCon was still very much like YouTubers meeting up with each other, but I would say that actually the first VidCon was also this turning point because there were fans, but it was very early fandom and they had full access to the creators. There wasn't this strong delineation between who was a creator and who was a fan. It really wasn't until kind of like 2013, 2014, 2015, when you started to see these real fandoms emerge, that's when you saw tours. You had content creators going on mall tours. Companies like Buca di Beppo even had a content creator tour. That was my favorite example because I found all their signage for it and it was so funny. Like, “Hey, look, we have like Internet stars at book Buca di Beppo, come to Buca di Beppo!” Like, what? But they were trying to capitalize on this like youth fandom. Obviously Magcon, if you guys haven't watched Chasing Cameron on Netflix, it's such a time capsule. It's a documentary about Magcon from like 2015 or 2016. Magcon was one of the original influencer tourists, it stands for “meet and greet.” So yeah, you started to see fandom manifest IRL. And then now I think all the platforms are so big and everyone is online that it's very clear who has fans; like you see the fandom. It's become more pervasive and recognized. It used to be like, “Oh, those are just like internet fans,” and now it’s like, “Oh, it’s all the same.” [Misogyny] was such a through line in reporting this book: all these incredible women who have been driven off the internet by hate. JD: I remember when BeReal was having its moment in the sun, there was a lot of talk about how it was somehow not playing into some of these more complicated threads of social media. What are you thoughts on that? Do you see any other glimmers that social media is shifting toward less rankings or gamified examples, or is it really just doubling down? TL: I would say mostly it's doubling down, but yeah, there's a lot of small viral apps that haven't proven to have staying power, but they sort of tap into something. BeReal’s an example of that. The reason I end the book where I do, which is in 2022-ish, is because I think that was the end of a certain chapter of social media. As the pandemic has pushed everyone online, especially in 2020, I think there's a level of exhaustion. I think people today are starting to value privacy more. We've gone so far where like, we are in this mass surveillance culture where everyone just records everyone else. You know, “Oh, I see something crazy. I'm going to record it because that could be a viral moment online, because we all understand that that's a commodity now.” I think that's why you see people actually wanting to use these smaller platforms like BeReal where it's more contained or like group chat or Discord or places where you're not default sharing everything publicly and permanently. That era of social media, it's a little bit over. It's not really novel to like, have every thought be public. I think if you want to reach everyone, you can post on these platforms, but it's more about reaching who you want to. Even TikTok is more about reaching who you want to than Instagram, Twitter, or YouTube, because the algorithm segments you and you trust that it will deliver your content to the relevant audience. Whereas all these other problems you're posting publicly and you have to build your own subscribers and it's a lot of burden on the user. JD: Do you see part of where you chose to draw this line around 2022ish correlating it all to Gen Z officially being the “it” generation or are those two things incidental to each other? TL: I think 2017 was the moment that Gen Z became the “it” generation. I wrote a piece that year actually about Gen Z consultants and how consulting for Gen Z stuff was taking off. That's when brands really started to flip and target Gen Z. So I think we're actually more in the middle of Gen Z; it's more just like average people have all gotten very online. The pandemic accelerated a lot of change that was happening, but now we're there. Everyone has an online footprint. Everyone's online. It's not just the kids. It's affecting politics, sports, fashion, entertainment—every single aspect of our culture is so shaped and driven by the Internet now. And so I wanted to end it there because I felt like we had reached that point. It was less about a specific generation maturing. I did see some marketing report about Gen Alpha recently and I was like, “Are we even thinking about that already?” Like there's so many generations. One other thing that I thought was notable or kind of changed my own perception is I think as a millennial—I'm with you. I'm like smack—dab, like true millennial millennial. I had always thought that millennials were the first generation to really leverage the internet and grow up on social media, which is sort of true, but actually all those early bloggers were Gen X—like those mommy bloggers were Gen X—and even Keemstar or Ethan Klein at H3H3, like these big YouTubers, are Gen X. A lot of them are a little bit older than we think. The Internet is thought of as this thing that's driven by young people. I mean, Jeffree Star is Gen X! So many Gen Xers actually have shaped the Internet. And I think they deserve more credit. I know people say that they're always an overlooked generation, and I think their contributions to the Internet have been overlooked. I know they're cringy online sometimes, but they really did a lot. JD: My partner's son is a Gen Alpha and there's definitely a sense that like, no matter how cool I would ever want to try to be on the internet, that I'm always going to be cringe. So I think there's this generational thing where you sort of reject whatever the previous generation did—and I wonder how long that lasts too. Because as you're describing, Gen X bust down the walls, millennials are much more platform-oriented, and now there's this proliferation of platforms, but then how different does that become in the future? That depends on a lot of factors in terms of technology and other things that are out of our ability to accurately forecast. Thinking about your rolein this: you kind of defined the digital culture beat. It wasn't something people took seriously, before you. And now there's a whole crop of people who cite you as their main influence in this type of coverage. This being your first big book, can you talk me through a little bit of the creative process and decision-making process in picking what pieces of this puzzle to highlight? Because in some ways, there are inevitably holes, because there were so few people even covering it in the first place—so even going back to the historical work I assume was pretty complicated. TL: Yeah, it was really hard. From 2009-on, that's when I was writing and covering things. I lived through this and I have sources, so it was easy. What was very hard was the Aughts. I would say shout out to Todd Spangler at Variety. I don't know that I could have written this book without Todd's writing. He deserves more credit. I should have given him acknowledgement; I gave it to a lot of women, but like there were these writers. Josh Constine at TechCrunch was another one. They ended up covering a lot of this stuff really early and really well, on digital media sites generally. But yeah, the Aughts were what was really hard. I had to go back and just interview so many people. I have interviewed hundreds of people for the book, but there was a lot of what I've learned now is called link rot—which actually happened to me; my earliest, my first bylines are not even on the internet anymore because the websites I wrote for were like bought and defunct or pivoted or whatever. I could have never written this book without the Internet Archive. Like the internet archive is such an important resource. It's so funny because Elon Musk was saying that my family owned it or something a while ago, and the founder was like, “We don't know her and we don't claim her,” But they deserve all the money in the world because the work that they're doing to preserve websites and old pieces of media is just really important because I was relying on that heavily. I opened with this story about this blog called Socialite Rank; if that wasn't completely preserved on the Internet Archive, we would not have a historical record of it. We would have, like, maybe a New York magazine article that was written after the fact that was sort of a short piece that didn't cover everything. It's just so important to have that source material. I'll say one other thing. I'm just so glad that there's more writers now. There's not even nearly enough. I mean, there's more reporters covering Facebook—just Facebook as a company—than there are Internet culture reporters. And I think that says so much about how we view tech reporting. I wish that we had like 50 more reporters on this beat. JD: Why do you think there's resistance? When I look at your work and when I look at Kat Tenbarge’s work, Katie Notopoulos’s work, I'm assuming highly trafficked stories. It's not as if these are not proving themselves out in the metrics. What do you think the resistance is in terms of staffing appropriately to cover these stories? TL: It’s what comes with it. The attention that the attention is the problem. Every major story I do goes viral because I'm writing about huge personalities. I'm writing about people usually with millions of followers that are going to respond. I'm writing about things that everyone's talking about or has strong opinions on or that's trending or whatever. If you do the job well, you are in their world, right? You are in this content creator universe where it's crazy. You're operating in this new media ecosystem that's an attention driven ecosystem that's been weaponized by the worst people in the world. So you as a media company need to stand by your reporters. This is why the New York Times—no offense—doesn't do internet culture reporting well, because they're not willing to go into those spaces and truly cover them. You have a couple of reporters that might dip in one, you know, now and then, but they don't have anybody actually covering it. That's why they cover everything like two months too late. I will say though, Jessica Roy is very good and she's been writing for them lately, and she's extremely with it, and Joe Bernstein as well, but I think it's so funny that those two writers are on the style section. That just shows how they view it, like, “Oh, it's this silly little thing over here. It's not like a core thing that's upending everything in our political landscape and economy.” I think it's just so hard for traditional media. They're very scared of the Internet. They're very scared of it and they don't know how to react when when attention is driven their way. And they don't they don't know what to do, and the reporters themselves are often driven out of the industry. I can think of three women right now who are phenomenal, phenomenal reporters who were driven out of the industry—off of this beat specifically—because of online harassment and hate and doxing and crazy shit that they've had to deal with. So you also have to be really good at dealing with that. And I would say, I started in this world in 2009, and I feel like—what is the metaphor of the boiling frog? Like, everything that happened to me with, like, writing about Libs of TikTok, I was like, Jake Paul fans have done this to me years before. I'm old enough too where it doesn't affect my life as much, but these young reporters, they're even more online. Their lives are even more mediated by the Internet. It's very hard for them. And if they don't have institutional support they can't do their job. JD: I'm remembering this moment where, I think it was either right before or right after you had departed New York Times, there was this public exchange with Maggie Haberman that I found to be really telling. And it's not necessarily age or generational, because of course, as you sort of pointed out, there are very savvy and thoughtful, older reporters—but it was kind of an older sensibility about how a reporter is supposed to comport themselves and the certain types of objectivity they're supposed to maintain, and the persona— TL: It wasn't about objectivity, though, it was about having a personal brand. First of all, I don't believe in objectivity. It's a lie. And I think Wes Lowery has written excellent pieces dismantling that notion. But yeah. I had said in an interview—actually, I was asked the question about journalists having personal brands—and I was like, yes, journalists have to have personal brands, especially on the internet these days. It's a very talent driven industry. And Maggie, who had of course 1.7 million followers, and I would say almost no one is more of a personal brand than her, especially during the Trump administration, came after me for it and said that I was an attention-seeker and all this negative stuff. I just thought that was hilarious because, look in the mirror, what are you talking about? You are a perfect example of this. You have 1. 7 million Twitter followers; don't talk to me about personal brands. But I think as you said, it's this old-school notion—she didn't have to build her personal brand. She didn't have to do any of that because she relied on the platform of the institution. Now institutions don't have power. And if you want to survive in this landscape where we're all getting laid off 24/7, which any millennial that worked in digital media or any Gen Z person can relate to, you do actually have to have a brand on the Internet. I don't think that that's necessarily a great thing because I think there's a lot of amazing reporters that don't want to cultivate it necessarily. I talked to a friend who's actually still at the New York Times, a phenomenal investigative reporter, and he's like, “Yeah, even I have to have a personal brand. That doesn't mean that I'm on TikTok, but I'm known as this investigator and I have to be really careful to cultivate this personality around that and cultivate my image around it. You have to do that just to operate—media has always been this way. Look at Anderson Cooper. Look at Barbara Walters. Look at like any big journalist, Woodward and Bernstein, right? It's a talent business. So yes, unfortunately we have to have brands. And we all have to have brands, by the way. JD: Yeah I was very surprised to see that as well. And just building on that, do you have a heuristic or a set of boundaries in your mind for how a reporter can maintain a certain degree of reliability and authenticity with audience that you are attempting to cover something in a fair and balanced way (not in the weaponized sense)? In terms of having a brand that participates in creator culture while also being respected as somebody covering it. Are there any guardrails you can reference? TL: That's always been true for any culture reporter, right? It's like, of course, culture reporters that wrote about music and film or whatever, just culture in general, we live in culture, all of us do. You can't opt out of culture. And by the way, same with politics, like these political reporters like to think that, “Oh, I'm objective or I don't vote because I, because I'm a political reporter” It's like, what are you talking about? We all live in a political world. This is just the world that we all live in. I think the most important thing is to be fair and to be accurate and to be truthful. That's the most important thing. So sometimes I'm writing about somebody that maybe I don't personally love, but I'm accurate and truthful and fair, and I think it's better for me to be open and be like, “Look, yeah, I'm not personally a fan of this YouTuber or something, but I'm reporting on them fairly, and everything that's reported is truthful and accurate.” Just the way that a music writer, of course, they're not going to not listen to music and abstain from music because they have to be objective, like, they're going to like certain artists better than others, and that might shape what they choose to cover; they might want to cover a band that they really like that maybe wouldn't normally get covered or something. But, you know, it's their job to report on the industry, whether, you know, whether or not they like Taylor Swift, right? Like they're going to have to report on her tour being a huge success. This is what I think Wes Lowery is just so good at. He wrote this excellent piece and he's more articulate than I am on it, but it's like this false idea of objectivity where objectivity is really just one ideology and set of opinions that a lot of old white rich men hold. And that's considered the objective opinion, right? It's obviously a farce. The most important thing is to be truthful. I'm such an open book. If somebody asked me my opinion on something, I'll happily tell my opinion, but I don't let that opinion affect my work. I mean, we all decide what to cover based off things we're interested in, of course, or accountability things that we're focused on, but you know, it's so silly, all those conversations, because this has always been the case. And by the way, newspapers make political decisions all the time. Any kind of investigative journalism is inherently political, you know, if you're investigating gun violence deaths and putting together this big picture around gun violence, that says you have a specific outcome that you want. So I think we should just be more transparent about it because what readers don't trust is when you try and say that, “Oh no, I'm a completely neutral person.” It's like, well, no one is, we all live in the world. JD: You referenced rich white men and bias, and of course everybody's talking about Isaacson’s biography: the elephant in the room of media discourse is Elon Musk for the foreseeable future. Do you have any thoughts about where that is all heading? TL: Yeah. I definitely was reading all the excerpts that I could because I cover Elon sometimes and I wanted to know what he'd found. I wanted to write my book because my reporting always focuses not on those people. I wanted to write a book that was about the other side of tech, because I think so much of how we've understood the rise of social media is through these corporate narratives that center these men, like, I mean, The Social Network, right? That's the defining way that people understand the rise of social media, is through these narratives that just center Silicon Valley boy geniuses and powerful men. And every single tech book has to be like a company book. You know, we have like 10 WeWork books or we have the YouTube book and the Instagram book—which I love, by the way, Sarah Frier’s No Filter’s right behind me [referencing her bookshelf], it’s extremely good—but I think we need alternatives to that too. We need books that zoom out and tell the users’ side and look at these creators and look at the industry around it and how it's been shaped, because social platforms are very unique. They have a very symbiotic relationship with the user base. It's not like these tech geniuses just built these products and then everyone uses them how they want. In fact, quite the opposite. Usually the tech people had no idea what's going on, and a lot of them succeeded despite themselves. So for me, I didn't want to write another tech book that was just about some, you know, powerful man or some man that fell from grace, like SBF or whatever. I wanted to write about these other people who have been basically written out of history, and tell the story of social media through a cultural lens, not just through these tech Silicon Valley narratives. JD: I really appreciate that. And it makes for a much more, surprising and enriching reading experience. I have a few recurring, lightning-round style questions. You've answered them to a certain extent earlier, so feel free to repeat yourself. What's one thing you wish people paid more attention to? TL: Oh God, I mean misogyny on the internet. I'm gonna say it. Because that was such a through line in reporting this book: all these incredible women who have been driven off the internet by hate and it made me sad. JD: What's one resource you would recommend for making better sense of reality? TL: Oh, really good question. TikTok, I think people that don't use Tik Tok should spend time on it because it is a real window into culture today. It's such a defining, important platform. I think people should check it out. JD: What's one moment where your sense of reality was disrupted? TL: I guess when COVID hit, I was like, what is happening? I actually had a lot of beliefs about human nature and all this stuff before COVID that I now have completely changed my mind on. I used to think people were inherently good and I don't think that anymore. I think people are inherently evil. JD: You just feel like because of what was put on display when the pandemic came down? TL: Actually, it was what happened after in 2020. That was a really good year in the sense that people had a lot of solidarity and seem to care about other people. I'm severely immunocompromised and very sick. And so in 2020 was like, “Oh, people are having solidarity and clapping for the healthcare workers,” and now it’s like, “Oh, they’re banning masks and everyone can die. And we're going to have absolutely no systemic solutions to this virus that continues to maim and kill millions of people.” I lost another person I love to it that just several months ago, it's just horrible. It's horrible. And no one cares. In fact, there's real hostility, and I think a real eugenicist sort of thinking that's emerged out of COVID—which I learned is actually very common. Following the previous pandemic in 1919 as well, eugenics became this huge thing. I think we're seeing that now with this notion of vulnerable people where you can just die, like, hurry up and die because the rest of us are going to be fine. That's not true. Eventually you will get sick and die. That is true for everyone, whether it's old age or cancer or something. We all die, actually, and we all become vulnerable. You might not be medically vulnerable now, but you will be. And so I think it's really horrifying. The public sentiment, especially from political leaders, that’s what's really scary, the normalization of that thinking. And I'm like, “Oh damn, I thought we were better than that.” Now I think everyone is sort of inherently bad and we have to build societies to facilitate good behavior among people and caring about other people. We don't have a very collectivist society. We live in like one of the most individualistic countries in the world. And I think that's why we have, outside of China, which is just so much bigger than us, the highest rate of COVID deaths in the world still right now. JD: I remember reading—all caveats that the numbers could be off and whatever. But I remember reading something to the effect that, given the projected spread of COVID over the next 10 or 20 years or something like that, that we're essentially going to be dealing with like 20 percent of the population, in some way, large and small, affected by long term deleterious health impacts from COVID, which was really striking when you have, yeah, political leaders saying like, “It's done, let's go back to work.” TL: Yeah, sorry to all the sick and disabled people. You can just die. And by the way, there's absolutely no safety net for you. So if you do get disabled, you are dead to the world because we're living in this hyper-capitalist society where as soon as you lose value as a worker, your life loses value. And it's very sad to see leftists parrot at this stuff. Because no one has defended the capitalist state more than these leftists that also want to pretend that COVID is over. And it's scary because people have, like, socialist in their bio, and they're just like, “Oh, you can't work. You're useless.” It's like, “What are you guys talking about?” So it makes me very sad, it's one of the few things that I would have thought that nothing could get me to change my mind about previously. But now my mind is totally changed. JD: Let's rewind to pre-Covid because one thing I really did want to talk about with you is, you reference in your acknowledgements how Tumblr saved your life, and also that your taylorlorenz3.0 community was really supportive in making decisions around the book. I'd love to hear a little bit about those episodes in your life. TL: Yeah, I do think tumblr saved my life because I was so depressed before tumblr. So I got on tumblr in 2009. I wasn't really on the Internet before. I actually didn't have MySpace. I had Facebook in college, obviously, like every other person, but I wasn't really online until Tumblr and, Tumblr completely opened my world and got me everything in life. So I love Tumblr. And yeah, I have a bunch of accounts online that are just for fun, including my like, funny meme account. I've always had accounts like that. But I just love the community that I have online and my community of followers. I'm the most indecisive person ever, so when I had to make decisions about the book, I would always do polls and stuff, and they would always give me advice and help me, and obviously they're the ones that have pre-ordered my book and really supported me throughout my career and they support my work. I'm just so grateful to anyone that follows me and engages with my work and supports my work because I couldn't do it without them, you know, so shout out to all the followers. JD: Are there things that could happen at the level of creator culture or tech infrastructure of social media platforms that would maybe give you some more faith in the inherent goodness for humanity? Or maybe a cleaner way of phrasing the question is: what would you identify as something that's desperately needed in the social media creator ecosystems? TL: Well, I think because people are so inherently evil and bad that we really need technology to bring out the best in us. We need technology that brings us together and helps us create community in powerful and meaningful ways, and can help facilitate true connection between people and true understanding and empathy. Right now we have platforms that strip empathy, right? We have platforms that sew division and actually feed into the worst of human nature. My hope is that we build new, less profit-driven social technology that can help connect us and help build bonds. The Internet's power is as a connector of people. That is the whole point of the internet is to connect people. So I think we need to build more platforms that actually do that. And, you know, I don't know what that looks like, but it definitely does not look like Facebook and Twitter and Instagram, you know? JD: Definitely. All right, well, the book, I've got Extremely Online here, but you also have the official copies on your shelf. It's out October 3rd. TL: Yes, you have the rare collector's edition before I changed the cover to gold. Actually, it's out on pre-order now, so please pre-order. Pre-orders are like the only thing that matters for books, but you can get it officially in bookstores October 3rd. JD: Amazing. And where can people find you and information about the book in the meantime? TL: Yeah, on Instagram. I'm just at Taylor Lorenz on Instagram. I'm also on TikTok. And I'm on YouTube now at Taylor Lorenz. So the only platform I don't use anymore for news and tech stuff is Twitter. So everywhere else you can follow me. I'm on threads. We'll see if that goes anywhere and blue sky and all those other. JD: Amazing. Well, Taylor, thank you so much for being here. It's been a super illuminating conversation, and I really appreciate your book. TL: Thank you so much for having me. This was so fun. This podcast is edited and produced by me, Jesse Damiani.

                "title": "Kimberly Guilfoyle - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Kimberly Ann Guilfoyle (/ˈɡɪlfɔɪl/ GIL-foyl; born March 9, 1969) is an American television news personality and former prosecutor in San Francisco and Los Angeles. She served as an advisor and led the fundraising division of Donald Trump's 2020 presidential campaign. Guilfoyle studied at University of California, Davis, and the University of San Francisco School of Law, where she earned a J.D. degree. She became a prosecuting attorney in San Francisco and Los Angeles, California. She was an assistant district attorney in San Francisco from 2000 to 2004. From 2001 to 2006, she was married to Democratic politician Gavin Newsom, and was first lady of San Francisco during Newsom's first two years as mayor of that city. She is the former fiancée of Donald Trump Jr. Guilfoyle worked at Fox News from 2006 to 2018, and co-hosted The Five on the network.[2][3] She later joined America First Policies, a pro-Trump super PAC, to campaign for Republicans in the 2018 midterm elections.[4][5]. On December 10, 2024, President Trump nominated her as the U.S. ambassador to Greece. Guilfoyle was born in San Francisco on March 9, 1969. Her mother was Puerto Rican and her father was born in Ireland and immigrated to the United States at the age of 20. She was raised Catholic.[6] She grew up in the Mission District of San Francisco and in Westlake, Daly City.[7] Guilfoyle's mother, Mercedes, taught special education. She died of leukemia when Guilfoyle was 11.[8] Her father, Anthony \"Tony\" Guilfoyle, was born in Ennis, County Clare, Ireland, and immigrated to the United States in 1957 at the age of 20.[9] In 1958, while still an Irish citizen, he was drafted and spent four years in the U.S. Army.[7] After being discharged from the army, Tony Guilfoyle took up work in the construction trades. He later became a real estate investor. Until his death in 2008, he was a close advisor to his son-in-law, then–San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom.[10][11] Guilfoyle graduated from San Francisco's Mercy High School,[7][12] and then the University of California, Davis. She received her Juris Doctor from the University of San Francisco School of Law in 1994. While in law school, she interned at the San Francisco district attorney's office. She also was a lingerie and fashion model, being featured in local department stores advertising campaigns (including for Macy's) and modeling Victoria's Secret lingerie for a bridal magazine.[13] She later studied at Trinity College Dublin in Ireland. While there, Guilfoyle published research in international children's rights and European Economic Community law.[14] After law school, Guilfoyle taught in a public school district[7] and briefly worked as a prosecutor in San Francisco. She lost her job in 1996 when Terence Hallinan was elected district attorney and fired 14 of the city's prosecutors.[15] Guilfoyle worked for four years in Los Angeles as a deputy district attorney, serving on adult and juvenile cases. She received several awards at the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office, including Prosecutor of the Month.[14] In 2000, Guilfoyle was rehired by Hallinan in the San Francisco District Attorney's Office, where she was an assistant district attorney from 2000 to 2004. During this time she obtained a conviction while co-prosecuting with James Hammer in the 2002 case People v. Noel and Knoller, a second-degree murder trial involving a dog mauling, which received international attention.[16][17] In 2003, by which time her then-husband Gavin Newsom was the front-running candidate in the 2003 San Francisco mayoral election, Guilfoyle publicly accused her fellow assistant DA Kamala Harris (who was running in the 2003 election for district attorney) of being unwelcoming towards Kimberly Guilfoyle. This accusation occurred years earlier during Guilfoyle's re-hiring at the San Francisco district attorney's office. Harris denied this accusation. Guilfoyle did provide positive comments on Harris' qualifications for office; she described Harris as someone that would \"work very hard\" if elected district attorney, as well as \"very smart\" and \"a good speaker\".[18] In 1995, Guilfoyle worked on the reelection campaign of district attorney Arlo Smith. Around this time, she was also a regular fixture at political fundraisers organized by oil billionaire Gordon Getty, whose son William she dated. (It is not publicly known what the timeline is on Guilfoyle's relationship with Billy Getty.[19])[13] In January 2004, Guilfoyle moved to New York to host the program Both Sides on Court TV. In addition, she worked as a legal analyst on Anderson Cooper 360°.[20] She joined Fox News in February 2006 as host of the weekend show The Lineup. This was eventually canceled. Guilfoyle remained a regular contributor for the network, and in 2011 was picked as co-host of The Five. She worked as a host on the show until 2018.[21] In 2014, she began hosting and then co-hosting Outnumbered for nearly fifty episodes, plus a few more appearances until June 2018.[22] Guilfoyle also appeared weekly on the recurring segment \"Is It Legal?\" on The O'Reilly Factor until that show was cancelled in 2017, and as a weekly Thursday guest on Brian Kilmeade's Kilmeade and Friends radio show.[14] Guilfoyle guest-hosted Hannity, On the Record, Justice with Judge Jeanine, and Fox & Friends.[23] In mid-2017, Guilfoyle signed a long-term contract extension with Fox.[24] A year later, in July 2018, Guilfoyle abruptly left Fox News;[25] she began working for a pro–Donald Trump super PAC.[26][27] HuffPost reported that, at the time of her departure, the network had been in the midst of a year-long investigation of a sexual harassment accusation against Guilfoyle. Network officials had given Guilfoyle an ultimatum: Resign by the end of July or be fired.[26] The New Yorker subsequently corroborated reports that Guilfoyle had been forced to resign rather than leaving by choice.[28] After Guilfoyle left, Fox News agreed to an out-of-court settlement with an assistant who had accused Guilfoyle of sexual harassment. Terms were not disclosed. The New Yorker reported that the settlement was at least $4 million.[28] The assistant alleged that Guilfoyle frequently displayed herself naked, showed photographs of the genitalia of men she had sex with, and required her to sleep over at Guilfoyle's apartment.[28] The New Yorker independently verified several of the assistant's allegations.[28] In 2015, Guilfoyle published a semi-autobiographical advice book published by HarperCollins, titled Making the Case: How to Be Your Own Best Advocate, on her experiences growing up, working as a prosecutor, and encouraging people to advocate for themselves.[29] In April 2024, Guilfoyle announced the upcoming publication of The Princess and her Pup, a children's book that she has authored.[30] Ten percent of its sales are slated to benefit an nonprofit dedicated to animal welfare.[31] In December 2016, it was reported that Guilfoyle was being considered for the position of press secretary for the 45th United States president Donald Trump. Sean Spicer was considered the front-runner for the position,[32] and was ultimately selected. On the May 12, 2017, edition of The Five, co-host Bob Beckel hinted that Guilfoyle turned the job down. In an interview with Bay Area News Group on May 15, 2017, Guilfoyle confirmed she was in contact with the White House about the position following Spicer's resignation. She said: \"I'm a patriot, and it would be an honor to serve the country. I think it'd be a fascinating job, it's a challenging job, and you need someone really determined and focused, a great communicator in there with deep knowledge to be able to handle that position.\"[33][34] On May 19, Guilfoyle said she was under contract with Fox, indicating she turned the White House down. One month later, she extended her contract with Fox.[35] In 2018, The Washington Post described Guilfoyle as a \"conservative cheerleader for President Trump\".[36] In 2019, Guilfoyle and Donald Trump Jr. jointly toured school campuses, invited by venues such as the University of Florida, where they were paid $50,000 for their appearance from student activity fees, which led to complaints by anti-Trump students. At the event, two people were arrested and five were injured. Two years earlier, white nationalist Richard B. Spencer had preceded them as an invited speaker, generating similar controversy.[37][38] In 2020, Guilfoyle was reported to be the chair of the finance committee of the Trump Victory Committee.[39] As of early 2020, the Trump campaign was secretly paying Guilfoyle $15,000 per month through the campaign manager's private company, Parscale Strategy. Guilfoyle served as a surrogate on the stump and took on broad advisory roles.[40][41] In the Trump 2020 campaign, Guilfoyle managed a fund-raising division. This division paid socialite Somers Farkas to raise money.[42] The fundraising division managed by Guilfoyle was in internal turmoil amid departures of experienced staff and accusations of irresponsible spending.[43] In November 2020, Politico's reporting alleged that Guilfoyle had engaged in sexually explicit conversations during private Trump fundraisers that had made some attendees uncomfortable. Politico reported that many campaign insiders alleged that this was part of severe human resources problems that plagued fundraising division, likely damaging the Trump campaign's ability to keep pace with the Biden campaign's fundraising.[44] At the Republican National Convention in August 2020, Guilfoyle gave a speech endorsing Trump that was widely described by some observers as unnecessarily loud,[45] or unhinged.[46][47] Others in media described it as passionate.[48] She was criticized for describing herself as a first-generation American when her mother was from Puerto Rico and thus an American citizen.[49] She is a first generation American on her father's side, as he immigrated to the United States from Ireland.[9] On January 6, 2021, Guilfoyle joined Trump, Trump Jr., Rudy Giuliani, Eric Trump, and others on the Ellipse in Washington, D.C., to address the \"Save America March\". This resulted in the attack on the Capitol.[50] Having raised millions of dollars to support the rally, Guilfoyle was also involved in organizing the protest at the Capitol.[51] She was paid $60,000 for her 2.5 minute rally speech.[52] Guilfoyle was featured in a video screened at the rally by Trump Jr., \"break[ing] into the hip-shaking dance she's been showcasing at other recent pro-Trump rallies\" and \"tell[ing] Trump fans: 'Have the courage to do the right thing! Fight!'\"[53] Guilfoyle served on the platform committee of the 2024 Republican National Convention.[54] Guilfoyle delivered a speech at the convention.[55] While delivered in a similar fashion to her derided 2020 convention speech, the 2024 convention featured a in-person audience that reacted receptively to her speech.[56] Donald Trump named Guilfoyle as the new United States ambassador to the country of Greece in 2025.[57] Early into her work as a prosecutor in San Francisco, Guilfoyle briefly dated William Getty, a scion of the Getty family.[13] In December 2001, Guilfoyle married politician Gavin Newsom, then a San Francisco city supervisor. Newsom was elected mayor of San Francisco in 2003. While married to Newsom, she used the name Kimberly Guilfoyle Newsom. The couple appeared in the September 2004 issue of Harper's Bazaar; the spread had them posed at the Getty Villa, and they were referred to in the title as the \"New Kennedys\".[58] In January 2005, citing the strain of a bicoastal marriage, Guilfoyle and Newsom jointly filed for divorce.[59] Their divorce was final on February 28, 2006.[60] It later emerged that Newsom, then 39, was having an affair with Ruby Rippey-Tourk, the wife of his then-campaign manager and former deputy chief of staff, Alex Tourk.[61] It is unclear if Guilfoyle knew about the affair before the scandal broke in 2007.[61] On May 27, 2006, in Barbados, Guilfoyle married furniture heir Eric Villency.[62] On October 4, 2006, Guilfoyle gave birth to their son,[63] Ronan.[64] Guilfoyle and Villency divorced in November 2009.[65] In June 2018, Vanessa Trump, who had filed for divorce from Donald Trump Jr. three months earlier, confirmed that Guilfoyle was dating Trump Jr.[66] In mid-2019, Guilfoyle and Trump Jr. jointly purchased a $4.4 million home in The Hamptons. They sold it in March 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic for $8.14 million.[67][68] Also in March 2021, the couple jointly purchased a $9.7 million home in Jupiter, Florida.[69] Guilfoyle and Trump became engaged on December 31, 2020. The news of the engagement was not made public until January 2022.[70] Since 2021, Guilfoyle and Trump Jr. have cohabitated in their Jupiter residence.[71] Guilfoyle's 2017 departure from Fox News was due to alleged sexual harassment on her part.[26][28] Fox News later reached a settlement of at least $4 million with Guilfoyle's accuser.[28] The assistant alleged that Guilfoyle frequently displayed herself naked, showed photographs of the genitalia of men she had sex with, and required her to sleep over at Guilfoyle's apartment.[28] The New Yorker independently verified several of the assistant's allegations.[28] Guilfoyle has also faced separate allegations of making sexually explicit comments at fundraisers. In 2004, it was reported that in speaking on behalf of then-husband, Gavin Newsom, at the Empire State Pride Agenda gay rights fundraiser, Guilfoyle boasted about his attractiveness and large penis size, and implied (through innuendo and pantomiming) that she was talented at providing oral sex. This was treated in San Francisco as a political controversy. Guilfoyle subsequently denied that her arm gestures were meant to be a sexually explicit pantomime.[72] In November 2020, Politico's reporting alleged that Guilfoyle had engaged in sexually explicit conversations during private Trump fundraisers that had made some attendees uncomfortable, including explicit conversations involving Trump Jr., disclosing at a fall 2018 fundraiser that Trump Jr. liked her to cosplay as a Dallas Cowboys cheerleader, making an offer at a December 2019 fundraiser to personally reward the event's top contributor with a lap dance, and offering at a 2020 fundraiser to host a hot tub party for its top contributor. A Trump campaign spokesperson denied this, asserting that \"in context\" nothing about her remarks at fundraisers had been offensive.[44]",

Her extensive experience and leadership in law, media, and politics along with her sharp intellect make her supremely qualified to represent the United States, and safeguard its interests abroad,” Trump wrote in his announcement on Truth Social. Guilfoyle, 55, is a lawyer who briefly served as a prosecutor in California before turning to a career in television. She spent 12 years at Fox News before transitioning to assisting Republican political goals. Since 2016, Guilfoyle has become a devoted Trump ally, campaigning for Trump during his 2020 and 2024 presidential elections across the country. She may be most well known for giving an unnecessarily loud speech during the 2020 Republican National Convention and speaking at the infamous Stop the Steal Rally on January 6. Guilfoyle has been engaged to Donald Trump Jr. since 2020. However, unconfirmed media reports claimed the two have since split. She is divorced from Democrat and California Governor Gavin Newsom. “Kimberly is perfectly suited to foster strong bilateral relations with Greece, advancing our interests on issues ranging from defense cooperation to trade and economic innovation,” Trump said in his statement. Guilfoyle said in a statement on X that she was “honored” to accept the nomination and championed the “democratic values born in Greece.” “It was the democratic values born in Greece that helped shape the founding of America. And now, we have an opportunity to honor that history by bringing better days here at home and abroad. As ambassador, I look forward to delivering on the Trump agenda, supporting our Greek allies, and ushering in a new era of peace and prosperity.” She wrote. The nomination will require Senate approval. Trump is known to give his family members and close friends positions within his administration. During his first term, his daughter, Ivanka Trump, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, were made advisers. The president-elect recently tapped Charles Kusher, the father of Jared Kusher, to serve as ambassador to France. Trump also pardoned Kusher during his first term.",

Trump Jr. and Guilfoyle, 55, have not officially split—though the eldest child of the president-elect has reportedly made it no secret in Florida circles. Guilfoyle was previously married to California Governor Gavin Newsom before moving onto Trump Jr. in 2018. “I’m honored to accept President Trump’s nomination to serve as the next Ambassador to Greece and I look forward to earning the support of the U.S. Senate,” Guilfoyle said in a statement on X.“President Trump’s historic victory is bringing hope and optimism to the American people and to freedom-loving allies across the world.

                "title": "Mitch McConnell - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Addison Mitchell McConnell III[1] (/məˈkɒnəl/; born February 20, 1942) is an American politician and retired attorney who has been serving as Senate minority leader since 2021 and the senior United States senator from Kentucky since 1985, the longest-serving senator in Kentucky history. McConnell has been the leader of the Senate Republican Conference since 2007, including as majority leader from 2015 to 2021, making him the longest-serving Senate party leader in U.S. history. McConnell holds conservative political positions, although he was known as a pragmatist and a moderate Republican early in his political career. He led opposition to stricter campaign finance laws, culminating in the U.S. Supreme Court decision Citizens United v. FEC, which partially overturned the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (McCain-Feingold) in 2010. McConnell worked to withhold Republican support for major presidential initiatives during the Obama administration, making frequent use of the filibuster, and blocked many of President Obama's judicial nominees, including Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland. During the Trump administration, the Senate Republican majority under McConnell's leadership passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act in 2018, the First Step Act, and the Great American Outdoors Act, and confirmed a record number of federal appeals court judges during a president's first two years. McConnell invoked the nuclear option to eliminate the 60-vote requirement to end a filibuster for Supreme Court nominations, after his predecessor Harry Reid had eliminated the filibuster for all other presidential nominations; Trump subsequently won Supreme Court confirmation battles over Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. While supportive of most of Trump's domestic and foreign policies, McConnell criticized Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, and despite voting to acquit in Trump's second impeachment trial for reasons related to the constitutionality of impeaching a former president, deemed him \"practically and morally responsible\" for the January 6 United States Capitol attack.[2] In 2015, 2019 and 2023, Time listed McConnell as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.[3][4] On February 28, 2024, McConnell announced that he would step down as the Senate Republican Conference Leader in January 2025, but would serve the remainder of his Senate term.[5][6][7] An internal election to fill the post of Senate Republican Leader was held on November 13, in which South Dakota senator John Thune was selected.[8] McConnell was born on February 20, 1942, to Julia Odene \"Dean\" (née Shockley) and Addison Mitchell \"A.M.\" McConnell II[9] at Colbert County Hospital in Sheffield, Alabama, and grew up in Athens, Alabama, where his grandfather, Robert Hayes McConnell Sr., and his great-uncle, Addison Mitchell McConnell, owned McConnell Funeral Home.[9][10] He is of Scots-Irish and English descent. His ancestor James McConnell fought on the American side in the American Revolutionary War.[9][11] In 1944, at the age of two, McConnell's upper left leg was paralyzed by a polio attack.[9][12] He and his mother were living with an aunt in Five Points, Alabama, at the time, and he received treatment at the Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation.[13] The treatment potentially saved him from being disabled for the rest of his life.[14] McConnell said his family \"almost went broke\" because of costs related to his illness.[15] In 1950, when he was eight, McConnell moved with his family from Athens to Augusta, Georgia, where his father, who was in the Army, was stationed at Fort Gordon.[16] In 1956, his family moved to Louisville, Kentucky, where he attended duPont Manual High School.[16] McConnell was elected student council president at his high school during his junior year.[16] He graduated Omicron Delta Kappa from the University of Louisville with a B.A. in political science in 1964 with honors.[17] He was president of the Student Council of the College of Arts and Sciences and a member of the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity.[18] McConnell attended the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, where Martin Luther King Jr. gave the \"I Have a Dream\" speech.[19] In 1964, at the age of 22, he attended civil rights rallies,[20] and interned with Senator John Sherman Cooper. He has said his time with Cooper inspired him to run for the Senate later in life.[21][22] In 1967, McConnell graduated from the University of Kentucky College of Law, where he was president of the Student Bar Association.[18][23] In March 1967, shortly before the expiration of his educational draft deferment upon graduation from law school, McConnell enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve as a private at Louisville.[24] This was a coveted position because the Reserve units were mostly kept out of combat during the Vietnam War.[24][25]: 11–12 His first day of training at Fort Knox, Kentucky, was July 9, 1967, two days after taking the bar exam, and his last day was August 15, 1967.[18][24] Shortly after his arrival he was diagnosed with optic neuritis and deemed medically unfit for military service, and was honorably discharged.[24][26] McConnell's political opponents have repeatedly made an issue of his brief time in service during his electoral campaigns.[24][26][27] McConnell first served as a Deputy United States Assistant Attorney General under President Gerald Ford from 1974 until 1975 and then as Jefferson County Judge/Executive from 1977 until 1984 in Kentucky. He was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1984 and is the second Kentuckian to serve as a party leader in the Senate.[28] During the 1998 and 2000 election cycles, he was chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. He was elected Majority Whip to Bill Frist in the 108th Congress and reelected to the post in 2004. In November 2006 he was elected Senate minority leader, the post he held until Republicans took control of the Senate in 2015. From 1968 to 1970, McConnell worked as chief legislative assistant to Senator Marlow Cook in Washington, D.C., managing a legislative department consisting of five members as well as assisting with speechwriting and constituent services.[29] In 1971, McConnell returned to Louisville, where he worked on Tom Emberton's campaign for governor of Kentucky, which was unsuccessful.[29] McConnell attempted to run for a seat in the state legislature but was disqualified because he did not meet the residency requirements for the office.[29] He then worked for the Louisville law firm Segal, Isenberg, Sales and Stewart for a few years.[30][29] During the same period, he taught a night class on political science at the University of Louisville.[23][31][32] In October 1974, McConnell returned to Washington to fill a position as Deputy Assistant Attorney General under President Ford, where he worked alongside Robert Bork, Laurence Silberman, and Antonin Scalia.[23][29] He also served as acting United States Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legislative Affairs under President Ford in 1975.[33][34] In 1977, McConnell was elected the Jefferson County judge/executive, the top political office in Jefferson County, Kentucky, at the time, defeating incumbent Democrat Todd Hollenbach III, 53% to 47%. He was reelected in 1981 against Jefferson County Commissioner Jim \"Pop\" Malone, 51% to 47%, outspending Malone 3–1, and occupied the office until his election to the U.S. Senate in 1984.[21][29] In his early years as a politician in Kentucky, McConnell was known as a pragmatist and a moderate Republican.[21][25] Over time he became more conservative.[21][25] According to one of his biographers, McConnell transformed \"from a moderate Republican who supported abortion rights and public employee unions to the embodiment of partisan obstructionism and conservative orthodoxy on Capitol Hill.\"[25] McConnell has widely been described as an obstructionist.[35] From 1997 to 2001, McConnell chaired the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the body charged with securing electoral victories for Republicans.[36][37] On February 12, 1999, he was one of 50 senators to vote to convict and remove Bill Clinton from office.[38] He was first elected Majority Whip in the 108th Congress.[39] Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist did not seek reelection in the 2006 elections. In November, after Republicans lost control of the Senate, they elected McConnell minority leader.[40] After Republicans took control of the Senate following the 2014 Senate elections, McConnell became the Senate Majority Leader.[41] In June 2018 he became the longest-serving Senate Republican leader in U.S. history.[42] McConnell is the second Kentuckian to serve as a party leader in the Senate (after Alben W. Barkley led the Democrats from 1937 to 1949)[17] and the longest-serving U.S. senator from Kentucky.[43] McConnell has a reputation as a skilled political strategist and tactician.[44][45][46][47] This reputation dimmed after Republicans failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) in 2017 during consolidated Republican control of government.[48][49][50][51] McConnell regularly obtained earmarks for businesses and institutions in Kentucky until Congress banned the practice in 2010.[52] He has been criticized for funding \"temporary patches\" to Kentucky's long-term healthcare problems while simultaneously opposing and obstructing national programs that seek to improve healthcare more systematically, such as Obamacare and Medicaid expansion.[32] Defunct Newspapers Journals TV channels Websites Other Economics Gun rights Identity politics Nativist Religion Watchdog groups Youth/student groups Miscellaneous Other As the leading Republican senator, McConnell confronted and pressured other Republican senators who were willing to negotiate with Democrats and the Obama administration.[53] According to Purdue University political scientist Bert A. Rockman, \"pure party line voting has been evident now for some time ... but rarely has the tactic of 'oppositionism' been so boldly stated as McConnell did.\"[54] According to University of Texas legal scholar Sanford Levinson, McConnell learned that obstruction and Republican unity were the optimal ways to ensure Republican gains in upcoming elections after he observed how Democratic cooperation with the Bush administration on No Child Left Behind and Medicare Part D helped Bush's 2004 reelection.[55] Levinson noted, \"McConnell altogether rationally ... concluded that Republicans have nothing to gain, as a political party, from collaborating in anything that the president could then claim as an achievement.\"[55] A number of political scientists, historians, and legal scholars have characterized McConnell's obstructionism and constitutional hardball as contributors to democratic erosion in the United States.[56][57][58][59] In October 2010, McConnell said, \"the single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.\" Asked whether this meant \"endless, or at least frequent, confrontation with the president\", McConnell said, \"if [Obama is] willing to meet us halfway on some of the biggest issues, it's not inappropriate for us to do business with him.\"[60] According to political scientists Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson, \"Facing off against Obama, [McConnell] worked to deny even minimal Republican support for major presidential initiatives—initiatives that were, as a rule, in keeping with the moderate model of decades past, and often with moderate Republican stances of a few years past.\"[61] The New York Times wrote early in Obama's administration that \"on the major issues—not just health care, but financial regulation and the economic stimulus package, among others—Mr. McConnell has held Republican defections to somewhere between minimal and nonexistent, allowing him to slow the Democratic agenda if not defeat aspects of it.\"[62] The Republican caucus threatened repeatedly to force the United States to default on its debt, McConnell saying he had learned from the 2011 debt-ceiling crisis that \"it's a hostage that's worth ransoming\".[63][64] McConnell worked to delay and obstruct health care reform and banking reform, two of the most notable pieces of legislation that Democrats navigated through Congress early in Obama's tenure.[65][66] Political scientists noted that \"by slowing action even on measures supported by many Republicans, McConnell capitalized on the scarcity of floor time, forcing Democratic leaders into difficult trade-offs concerning which measures were worth pursuing. ... Slowing the Senate's ability to process even routine measures limited the sheer volume of liberal bills that could be adopted.\"[66] One of McConnell's most common tactics as minority leader to delay or obstruct legislation and judicial appointments was the filibuster. A filibuster is an attempt to \"talk a bill to death\", forcing Senate leadership to abandon a proposed measure instead of waiting out the filibuster―or at least to delay the measure's passage. In the Senate, any senator may speak for unlimited duration unless a 60-person majority votes to invoke cloture, or end debate, and proceed to a final vote. Political scientists have referred to McConnell's use of the filibuster as \"constitutional hardball\", referring to the misuse of procedural tools in a way that undermines democracy.[61][64][57][67] Political scientists Hacker and Pierson describe the rationale behind McConnell's filibusters: \"Filibusters left no fingerprints. When voters heard that legislation had been 'defeated', journalists rarely highlighted that this defeat meant a minority had blocked a majority. Not only did this strategy produce an atmosphere of gridlock and dysfunction; it also chewed up the Senate calendar, restricting the range of issues on which Democrats could progress.\"[61] In 2013, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid eliminated the filibuster for all presidential nominations except the Supreme Court. By that time, nearly half of all votes to invoke cloture in the history of the Senate had occurred during Obama's presidency.[58] In April 2017, Senate Republicans led by McConnell eliminated the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations in order to end debate on the nomination of Neil Gorsuch.[68][69][70] In August 2019, McConnell wrote an editorial for The New York Times strongly opposing the elimination of the filibuster on legislation.[71] McConnell initially endorsed fellow Kentucky senator Rand Paul for president in 2016. Paul withdrew from the race after the Iowa caucuses, and McConnell endorsed presumptive nominee Donald Trump on May 4, 2016.[72] But McConnell disagreed with Trump on many occasions. In May 2016, after Trump suggested that federal judge Gonzalo P. Curiel was biased against Trump because of his Mexican heritage, McConnell said: \"I don't agree with what [Trump] had to say. This is a man who was born in Indiana. All of us came here from somewhere else.\" In July 2016, after Trump criticized the parents of Humayun Khan, a Muslim-American soldier who was killed in Iraq, McConnell said, \"All Americans should value the patriotic service of the patriots who volunteer to selflessly defend us in the armed services.\" On October 7, 2016, following the Donald Trump Access Hollywood controversy, McConnell said, \"As the father of three daughters, I strongly believe that Trump needs to apologize directly to women and girls everywhere, and take full responsibility for the utter lack of respect for women shown in his comments on that tape.\"[73] In private, McConnell reportedly expresses disdain for Trump[74] and \"abhors\" his behavior.[75] In October 2017, White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon and other Trump allies blamed McConnell for stalling the Trump administration's legislation. In response, McConnell cited Neil Gorsuch's confirmation to the Supreme Court to show that the Senate supported Trump's agenda.[76] After Joe Biden defeated Trump in the 2020 election, McConnell at first refused to recognize Biden as the winner.[77][78][79] In his public statements, McConnell did not repeat any of Trump's false claims of voter fraud, but did not contradict them, ignoring questions about evidence and instead arguing that Trump had the right to challenge the results.[78][80][81] At the same time that McConnell refused to recognize Biden, he celebrated Republicans who won their Senate and House races in the same elections.[78][80][82] On December 15, the day after the electoral college vote, McConnell reversed his stance and publicly acknowledged Biden's win, saying, \"Today, I want to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden.\"[83] On January 6, during the Electoral College vote count, McConnell spoke out against the efforts of Trump and his allies to overturn the election: Trump claims the election was stolen. The assertions range from specific local allegations to constitutional arguments to sweeping conspiracy theories ... nothing before us proves illegality anywhere near the massive scale—the massive scale—that would have tipped the entire election. ... If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral. We'd never see the whole nation accept an election again. Every four years would be a scramble for power at any cost.[84] Later that day, he described the storming of the Capitol building (which occurred while the Electoral College votes were being counted) as a \"failed insurrection\" that \"tried to disrupt our democracy\".[85] On April 10, 2021, Trump called McConnell a \"dumb son of a bitch\". Trump added: \"I hired his wife. Did he ever say thank you?\"[86] Trump has continued to attack McConnell in personal terms since then, but McConnell has not responded publicly.[87][88] On November 5, 2019, as the House of Representatives began public hearings on the impeachment of President Trump, McConnell said, \"I'm pretty sure how [an impeachment trial is] likely to end. ... If it were today, I don't think there's any question. It would not lead to a removal.\"[89] On December 14, 2019, McConnell met with White House counsel Pat Cipollone and White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland. Later that day, he said that for Trump's impeachment trial, he would be in \"total coordination with the White House counsel's office\" and Trump's representatives.[90][91] He also said there was \"no chance\" the Senate would convict Trump and remove him from office.[92] On December 17, 2019, McConnell rejected a request to call four witnesses for Trump's impeachment trial because, according to McConnell, the Senate's role was to \"act as judge and jury\", not to investigate. Later that day, McConnell told the media: \"I'm not an impartial juror [in this impeachment trial]. This is a political process. There's not anything judicial about it.\"[93][94] After Trump's acquittal, McConnell was noted for his ability to block witnesses, to secure Trump's acquittal, and to maintain party unity during the impeachment process. Commentators noted that he had kept Republican senators \"marching in lockstep\" throughout the process.[95][96][97] On January 12, 2021, it was reported that McConnell supported impeaching Trump for his role in inciting the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol, believing it would make it easier for Republicans to purge the party of Trump and rebuild the party.[98] On January 13, despite having the authority to call for an emergency meeting of the Senate to hold the Senate trial,[failed verification] McConnell did not reconvene the chamber, claiming unanimous consent was required.[99] He called for delaying the Senate trial until after Biden's inauguration.[100] Once the Senate trial started, McConnell voted to acquit Trump on February 13, 2021, saying it was unconstitutional to convict a president who was no longer in office.[101] The vote to convict was a bipartisan majority (57–43) but not enough to pass the two-thirds threshold.[102] After the vote, McConnell lambasted and condemned Trump in a 20-minute speech on the Senate floor, saying he believed Trump was guilty of everything the House managers alleged.[103][104] He said: Former President Trump's actions preceding the riot were a disgraceful dereliction of duty ... There is no question that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of that day ... If President Trump were still in office, I would have carefully considered whether the House managers proved their specific charge.[105] He explained why he nonetheless voted to acquit: \"Article II, Section 4 must have force. It tells us the President, Vice President, and civil officers may be impeached and convicted. Donald Trump is no longer the president. Clearly that mandatory sentence cannot be applied to somebody who has left office. The entire process revolves around removal. If removal becomes impossible, conviction becomes insensible.\" Yet he said that Trump \"didn't get away with anything yet\" since Trump would remain subject to the country's criminal and civil laws.[105] When there was a proposal for an independent commission to investigate the January 6 United States Capitol attack, McConnell sought to organize Republican senators to filibuster it,[106] and on May 28, 2021, he voted against its creation.[107] McConnell's relationship with the Biden administration has been portrayed in media as one of comity. Biden has described McConnell as \"a friend, colleague and 'man of his word.'\" McConnell has praised bipartisan legislation they worked on together, and was the only Republican to attend the 2015 funeral of Biden's son Beau Biden.[108] In October 2021, McConnell helped pass a bill that extended the debt ceiling. He convinced 11 Republicans to vote with the Democrats for it, without which the United States would have defaulted on its debts.[109] Throughout Obama's tenure, McConnell led Senate Republicans in what has been called \"a disciplined, sustained, at times underhanded campaign to deny the Democratic president the opportunity to appoint federal judges\".[110] In June 2009, after Obama nominated Sonia Sotomayor as associate justice, McConnell and Jeff Sessions opined that Sotomayor's 17 years as a federal judge and over 3,600 judicial opinions would require lengthy review and advocated against Democrats hastening the confirmation process.[111] On July 17, McConnell announced that he would vote against Sotomayor's confirmation.[112] In August, McConnell called Sotomayor \"a fine person with an impressive story and a distinguished background\" but said he did not believe she would withhold her personal or political views while serving as a justice. Sotomayor was confirmed days later.[113] In May 2010, after President Obama nominated Elena Kagan to succeed the retiring John Paul Stevens, McConnell said in a Senate speech that Americans wanted to make sure Kagan would be independent of influence from White House as an associate justice and noted that Obama called Kagan a friend of his in announcing her nomination.[114] McConnell announced his opposition to Kagan's confirmation, saying she was not forthcoming enough about her \"views on basic principles of American constitutional law\".[115] Kagan was confirmed the next month.[116] In 2014, Republicans gained control of the Senate, and McConnell became majority leader; he used his new power to start what was considered \"a near blockade\" of Obama's judicial appointments. According to The New York Times, Obama's final two years as president saw 18 district court judges and one appeals court judge confirmed, the fewest since President Harry S. Truman. In comparison, the final two years of the presidencies of George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Ronald Reagan had between 55 and 70 district court judges each confirmed and between 10 and 15 appeals court judges confirmed.[110] The Los Angeles Times wrote that McConnell brought about an \"extraordinary two-year slowdown in judicial confirmations\", detailing 22 confirmations of Obama's judicial nominees, the lowest since Truman in 1951–1952. The number of federal judicial vacancies at the end of Obama's term was more than twice the number at the end of George W. Bush's term.[117][118] In a 2019 interview, McConnell credited himself for the large number of judicial vacancies created in the last two years of Obama's presidency.[90] On February 13, 2016, Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia died.[119] Shortly thereafter, McConnell issued a statement indicating that the Senate would not consider any Supreme Court nominee Obama put forth.[22][120] \"The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president\", McConnell said.[120] On March 16, 2016, Obama nominated Merrick Garland, a Judge of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, to the Supreme Court.[121] Under McConnell's direction, Senate Republicans refused to take any action on the nomination.[122] Garland's nomination expired on January 3, 2017, with the end of the 114th Congress.[123] In an August 2016 speech in Kentucky, McConnell said, \"one of my proudest moments was when I looked Barack Obama in the eye and I said, 'Mr. President, you will not fill the Supreme Court vacancy.'\"[124][125] In April 2018, McConnell said the decision not to act on Garland's nomination was \"the most consequential decision I've made in my entire public career\".[126] Political scientists and legal scholars called McConnell's refusal to hold Senate hearings on Garland \"unprecedented\",[127][128] a \"culmination of [his] confrontational style\",[129] a \"blatant abuse of constitutional norms\",[59] and a \"classic example of constitutional hardball\".[64] In January 2017, President Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left after Scalia's death.[130] Gorsuch's nomination was confirmed on April 7, 2017, after McConnell eliminated the filibuster on Supreme Court nominees.[131] On July 18, 2018, with Andy Oldham's Senate confirmation, Senate Republicans broke a record for largest number of appeals court judiciary confirmations during a president's first two years; Oldham became the 23rd appeals court judge confirmed in Trump's term.[132] McConnell said he considers the judiciary to be the item of Trump's first two years with the longest-lasting impact on the country. The record for the number of circuit court judges confirmed during a president's first year was broken in 2017, while the previous two-year record of 22 confirmations took place under President George H. W. Bush.[133] By March 2020, McConnell had contacted an unknown number of judges, encouraging them to retire before the 2020 election.[134][135] He confirmed 260 federal judges during Trump's four-year term, shifting the federal judiciary to the right. In July 2018, Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh to replace the retiring Anthony Kennedy as an associate justice of the Supreme Court. McConnell accused Democrats of creating an \"extreme\" distortion of Kavanaugh's record during his hearings.[136] In September 2018, Christine Blasey Ford publicly alleged that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her in 1982. After it was reported that Democrats were investigating a second allegation against Kavanaugh, McConnell said, \"I want to make it perfectly clear. ... Judge Kavanaugh will be voted on here on the Senate floor.\"[137] Kavanaugh was confirmed on October 6.[138][139] McConnell said the confirmation process was a low point for the Senate, but also downplayed reports of dysfunction in the Senate; he said claims that the Senate was \"somehow broken over this [were] simply inaccurate\".[140] In October 2018, McConnell said if a Supreme Court vacancy were to occur in 2020, he would not repeat his 2016 decision to let the winner of the upcoming presidential election nominate a justice. He argued that because in 2016 the Senate was controlled by a party other than the president's, the 2016 precedent was not applicable in 2020, when Republicans controlled both the presidency and Senate.[141] In September 2020, after Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, he announced the Senate would vote on Trump's nominated replacement.[142] On October 23, McConnell set in place the Senate debate on the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to fill Ginsburg's seat. Barrett was confirmed on October 26.[143] The federal government shut down on October 1–17, 2013, after Congress failed to enact legislation to fund it. McConnell later vowed Republicans would not force the U.S. to default on its debt or shut down the government in 2014, when stopgap funding measures were set to expire. He also said he would not allow other Republicans to obstruct the budget-making process.[144][145] In July 2018, McConnell said funding for the Mexico–United States border wall would likely have to wait until the midterms had concluded. Trump tweeted two days later that he was willing to allow a government shutdown to get funding.[146] Several spending bills were approved that August; the approvals were seen as a victory for McConnell in his attempts to prevent another government shutdown.[147] From December 22, 2018, until January 25, 2019, the federal government shut down when Congress refused to give in to Trump's demand for $5.7 billion in federal funds for a U.S.–Mexico border wall.[148] In December 2018, the Republican-controlled Senate unanimously passed an appropriations bill without wall funding, and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and Trump appeared likely to approve the bill. After Trump faced heavy criticism from some right-wing media outlets and pundits for appearing to back down on his campaign promise to \"build the wall\", he said he would not sign any appropriations bill that did not fund the wall.[149] During this shutdown, McConnell blocked the Senate from voting on appropriations legislation and said it was not his place to mediate between the Senate and Trump.[150][151][152] Privately, McConnell had advised Trump against initiating the shutdown.[22] Democrats criticized McConnell for not putting appropriations legislation up for a vote, noting that the Republican-controlled Senate had unanimously passed an appropriations bill without wall funding and that the Senate could override Trump's veto.[150][151][152] By January 23, McConnell had blocked four Senate bills to reopen the government and a bill funding the Homeland Security Department through February 8. He called for Democrats to support a Trump administration-backed measure that included $5.7 billion in wall funding, together with a temporary extension of protections for DACA recipients, a Democratic priority.[153] Privately, other Republican senators pressured McConnell to stop blocking appropriations legislation.[154][155] The shutdown ended on January 25, when Trump signed a three-week funding measure reopening the government until February 15 without funds for a border wall.[156] This was the longest government shutdown in American history.[22][157] In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, McConnell initially opposed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, calling it a Democratic \"ideological wish list\".[158][159] He reversed his position when Trump endorsed the proposed package.[160] The bill passed in the Senate by a vote of 90–8. McConnell also directed Senate Republicans in negotiations for two other COVID-19 response packages: the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020 and the CARES Act. The CARES Act was the largest economic stimulus package in U.S. history,[161] amounting to 10% of total U.S. gross domestic product.[162] It passed both houses of Congress with bipartisan support.[163] Speaking on the Hugh Hewitt radio show on April 22, 2020, McConnell suggested that states should be able to declare bankruptcy instead of receiving additional COVID-19 aid funds—funds he implied would be used to save insolvent state pension funds instead of for COVID-19 relief. His comments were sharply criticized by various state and local officials. States cannot declare bankruptcy.[164] After the CARES Act passed, McConnell waited several months before advancing any additional COVID-19 relief measures in the Senate, saying in May, \"I don't think we have yet felt the urgency of acting immediately\" and that Congress should \"[hit] pause\" to evaluate how the allocated funds were working before approving more.[165] He was absent from negotiations between congressional Democrats and White House officials for an additional aid package.[166][167][168] On September 10, 2020, a pared-down COVID-19 relief bill crafted by McConnell failed to pass the Senate because of a Democratic filibuster.[169] Democrats called the bill \"completely inadequate\" given the scope of the COVID-19 crisis[170] and a partisan maneuver to help Republican senators up for reelection.[171] McConnell called the bill a choice between \"do[ing] something\" and \"do[ing] nothing\",[172] and said he was holding the procedural vote to get lawmakers on the record about their willingness to compromise on COVID-19 legislation.[173] As the leader of the Senate Republicans, McConnell has received much of the criticism and disapproval that Republicans receive from Democratic voters, receiving near uniform disapproval from left-of-center voters. Furthermore, as a result of his unpopularity with Trump and the more populist base, McConnell has had historically low approval for a senator by the electorate as a whole: a 2012 poll and a 2016 poll each found that McConnell had the lowest home-state approval rating of any sitting senator.[174][175] With a 49% disapproval rate in 2017, McConnell had the highest disapproval rating of any senator.[176] In September 2019, the Morning Consult found that McConnell's approval rating had been underwater since the first quarter of 2017, when it was 44% positive and 47% negative. The worst rating since that time was in the fourth quarter of 2018, when he had a 38% positive rating and a 47% negative rating among Kentuckians.[177] At that time he was briefly not the least popular senator, surpassed by Claire McCaskill and Jeff Flake.[178] But as of the second quarter of 2019, McConnell's ratings were 36% positive and 50% negative. He netted −56 among Democrats, +29 among Republicans, and −24 among Independents.[177] An average of polls by the Economist/YouGov, Politico/Morning Consult, and Harvard-Harris from the end of July through August 2019 (7/31–8/27), was 23% favorable and 48% unfavorable (−25.0 spread).[179] In 2020, according to Morning Consult, Susan Collins edged out McConnell as the least popular senator with a 52% unfavorable rating from Maine voters compared to 50% for McConnell.[180] McConnell's committee assignments for the 118th Congress are as follows:[181] McConnell has taken conservative stances for the past several decades. During his Senate tenure, McConnell led opposition to stricter campaign finance laws,[182] culminating in the Supreme Court ruling that partially overturned the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (McCain-Feingold) in 2010. He led opposition against Obamacare,[183] first through efforts to delay or prevent the law's passage, and later to repeal or replace it, including via the American Healthcare Reform Act. McConnell has opposed stronger regulations, gun control measures and efforts to mitigate climate change. He has criticized proposed legislation by House Democrats such as the Green New Deal and Medicare for All,[184] and was criticized by Nancy Pelosi for withholding votes on measures passed by the Democratic-controlled House during his time as Senate Majority Leader, including the For the People Act of 2019, the Equality Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act.[185] McConnell has supported stronger border security, free trade agreements and reductions in taxes. As Senate Majority Leader, he led the passing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act in 2018. His foreign policy views have included support of sanctions on Cuba, Iran and Russia,[186] support of Ukraine during its invasion by Russia,[187] opposition to the Iran nuclear deal and support of Israel in its war with Hamas.[188] He voted for the Iraq Resolution, which authorized military action against Iraq,[189] and supported the Iraq War troop surge of 2007 in public.[190] Earlier in his political career, during the 1960s and 1970s, McConnell held moderate stances, including support of abortions, support of unions, and support of the civil rights movement.[191] Following the Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, McConnell expressed his opposition to same-sex marriage stating “I’ve always felt that marriage is between one man and one woman and the Supreme Court has held otherwise. That’s the law of the land.”[192] In 1984, McConnell ran for the U.S. Senate against two-term Democratic incumbent Walter Dee Huddleston. The election race was not decided until the last returns came in, when McConnell won by 3,437 votes out of more than 1.2 million votes cast, just over 0.4%.[193] McConnell was the only Republican Senate challenger to win that year, despite Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in the presidential election.[194] McConnell's campaign was noted for a series of television campaign spots called \"Where's Dee\", which featured a group of bloodhounds trying to find Huddleston,[195][better source needed][196] implying that Huddleston's attendance record in the Senate was poor.[197][198] He was the first Republican to win a statewide election in Kentucky since 1968, and benefited from the popularity of President Ronald Reagan, up for re-election, who was supported by 60% of Kentucky voters in the same year.[44] In 1990, McConnell faced former Louisville Mayor Harvey I. Sloane, winning by 4.4%.[199] In 1996, he defeated Steve Beshear by 12.6%,[200] even as Bill Clinton narrowly carried the state. McConnell's campaign ran television ads warning voters to not \"Get BeSheared\" and included images of sheep being sheared.[198] In 2002, he was unopposed in the Republican primary. He then defeated Lois Combs Weinberg by 29.4%.[201] In 2008, McConnell faced his closest contest since 1990. He defeated Bruce Lunsford by 6%.[23] In 2014, McConnell faced Louisville businessman Matt Bevin in the Republican primary.[202] The 60.2% won by McConnell was the lowest voter support for a Kentucky U.S. senator in a primary since 1938.[203] He faced Democratic Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes in the general election, and defeated Grimes, 56.2–40.7%.[204][205] In the November 2020 general election, McConnell faced Democratic nominee Amy McGrath, a former Marine fighter pilot; and Libertarian nominee Brad Barron, a businessman and farmer.[206][207] During the campaign, McConnell and McGrath agreed to one hour-long, socially distanced debate on October 12.[208][209] McConnell was elected to his seventh term on November 3 when he defeated McGrath by nearly 20 percentage points.[210] McConnell is a Southern Baptist, baptized at age 8.[211] He was married to his first wife, Sherrill Redmon, from 1968 to 1980 and had three daughters, Porter, Eleanor (Elly), and Claire.[212][213][214] Porter McConnell is the campaign director for Take on Wall Street, a left-wing advocacy coalition.[215][216] Following her divorce from McConnell, Redmon became a feminist scholar at Smith College and director of the Sophia Smith Collection.[217][218] McConnell's second wife, whom he married in 1993, is Elaine Chao, Secretary of Labor under President George W. Bush and Secretary of Transportation under President Donald Trump.[219] In May 2019, McConnell's brother-in-law Gordon Hartogensis, who is married to Chao's sister Grace, was confirmed by the U.S. Senate as director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), a part of the Labor Department.[220][221][222] McConnell voted to confirm.[223] In February 2003, McConnell underwent a triple heart bypass surgery in relation to blocked arteries, at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.[224] In August 2019, McConnell suffered a fall at his Louisville home; he fractured his shoulder.[225] In March 2023, he was hospitalized for five days after a fall; he was treated for a concussion and a minor rib fracture,[226] and did not return to the Senate for almost six weeks.[227] In July 2023, he fell while disembarking from a plane at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.[228] On July 26, 2023, McConnell prompted worldwide media reports when he froze, unspeaking, for around 20 seconds while addressing a press conference.[229] He was escorted away by aides, but later returned and said he was \"fine\".[230] Two days after the incident, his spokespersons said that McConnell would continue in his leadership role; he is the institution's longest-serving party leader.[231] On August 30, 2023, he again froze during a press conference in Covington, Kentucky and was eventually led away by staff.[232] A day later, McConnell released a letter from the attending physician of Congress that said that he was \"medically clear\" to continue his schedule as planned;[233] the letter said that the physician had talked to McConnell and \"conferred with his neurology team\", but did not indicate that he had physically examined McConnell.[234] In 1997, McConnell founded the James Madison Center for Free Speech, a legal-defense organization based in Washington, D.C.[235][236] He was inducted into the Sons of the American Revolution on March 1, 2013.[237] He is on the Board of Selectors of Jefferson Awards for Public Service.[238] In 2018, the OpenSecrets website ranked McConnell one of the wealthiest members of the U.S. Senate, with a net worth of more than $25 million.[239] His personal wealth grew in 2008, when he and his wife received a gift worth about $5 million to about $25 million from her father, James S. C. Chao, after the death of his wife.[240] McConnell's detractors have called him by a number of nicknames, including \"Moscow Mitch\",[241] \"Cocaine Mitch\",[241] the \"Grim Reaper\",[184] \"Darth Vader\",[242] \"Rich Mitch\",[243] \"Nuclear Mitch\",[242] \"Midnight Mitch\",[244] and \"Old Crow\".[245] McConnell embraces several of them, but he has objected strenuously to \"Moscow Mitch\".[241][246] Jon Stewart repeatedly mocked McConnell on The Daily Show for resembling a turtle or tortoise.[247][248] McConnell has been portrayed by Beck Bennett in sketches on Saturday Night Live.[249] In 2017, McConnell was portrayed satirically in South Park's season 21 episode \"Doubling Down\".[250] During the 2014 election campaign, McConnell was lampooned for posting campaign B-roll footage online for use by allied PACs. Various Internet posters satirically interspersed the B-roll with footage from sitcoms and movies and with popular music. The practice of posting B-roll footage online for use by PACs or of lampooning the B-roll was termed \"McConnelling\".[251][252][253] In 2015, 2019, and 2023, Time listed McConnell as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.[3][4][254]",

                "content": "Addison Mitchell \"Mitch\" McConnell, Jr. (born February 20, 1942) is the senior United States Senator from Kentucky. A member of the Republican Party, he is the Minority Leader of the Senate, succeeding Chuck Schumer. He is the longest-serving U.S. Senator in Kentucky history.[2] McConnell holds conservative positions, despite regarding as a moderate Republican early in his career. Mitch McConnell was born to Julia (née Shockley) and Addison Mitchell McConnell at Helen Keller Memorial Hospital in Sheffield, Alabama on February 20, 1942.[3][4] [5]He grew up in segregated Athens, Alabama.[6] They moved to southern Louisville, Kentucky and McConnell attended the duPont Manual High School. In 1964, he graduated with honors from the University of Louisville with a B.A. in political science. He graduated in 1967 from the University of Kentucky College of Law. In 1984, McConnell ran for the United States Senate against two-term Democratic incumbent Walter \"Dee\" Huddleston. The election race wasn't decided until the last polls returned came in, and McConnell won by a thin margin—only 5,200 votes out of more than 1.8 million votes cast, just over 0.4%.[7] McConnell was the only Republican Senate challenger to win that year, despite Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in the presidential election. Part of McConnell's success came from a series of television campaign spots called \"Where's Dee\", which featured a group of bloodhounds trying to find Huddleston,[8][9] implying that Huddleston's attendance record in the Senate was less than stellar. It is likely that he was helped by Ronald Reagan's 21-point win in Kentucky that year. His campaign bumper stickers and television ads asked voters to \"Switch to Mitch\". McConnell has repeatedly been found to have the lowest home state approval rating of any sitting senator.[10][11] McConnell is a member of the Baptist Church. His first wife was Sherrill Redmon,[12] from whom he was later divorced; they have three daughters. His second wife, whom he married in 1993, is Elaine Chao, the Secretary of Transportation under Donald Trump and the former Secretary of Labor under George W. Bush (the first Asian American woman to serve in the Cabinet). Senator McConnell's personal fortune was between $9,839,049 to $44,587,000 in 2010 and he was ranked as the 10th wealthiest member of the U.S. Senate.[13] In October 2024, the first autobiographical book, \"The Price of Power: How Mitch McConnell Mastered the Senate, Changed America, and Lost His Party\", about Mitch McConnell, will be released in the United States.[14]",

                "content": "In an era when many politicians pride themselves on being outsiders, Mitch McConnell has a reputation as a consummate creature of the DC establishment. Representing Kentucky in the Senate since 1985, Mr McConnell has won a reputation as a shrewd and tactical campaigner - even if few have found him a particularly charismatic figure. On Wednesday he announced that he would be giving up his post as Republican leader in the US Senate, which he has held for nearly two decades, after November's elections. Mr McConnell is already the longest-serving party leader in Senate history, having been elected to the leadership post a record nine times by his fellow Senate Republicans. As leader, he's been at the helm of some of Washington's most consequential decisions. Inscrutable, adaptable and a hard-charging deal-maker, Mr McConnell has earned both begrudging admirers and loathing critics. But in recent years, the 82-year-old has faced questions about his health, and he's regularly sparred with Donald Trump and the former president's supporters. In making the announcement that he was stepping down from the leadership post, Mr McConnell said: \"It's time for the next generation of leadership.\" Addison Mitchell McConnell III was born in Alabama in 1942 to working-class parents of English and Scots-Irish descent. At the age of two, he contracted polio, which left a portion of his left leg paralysed and saw him bullied by other kids. He has credited extensive physical rehabilitation and a protective mother with making sure he could walk again, adding that his family \"almost went broke\" covering his treatment. The McConnells moved to Kentucky in 1956 and their son went on to serve as student council president both in high school and at the University of Louisville, where he graduated with honours in 1964. His first foray on Capitol Hill came as a 22-year-old intern to Republican Senator John Sherman Cooper of Kentucky - an experience that convinced him to \"give [the Senate] a shot if I ever had a chance\". It was also a period of time that he has said bolstered his commitment to civil rights. He watched Martin Luther King Jr's \"I Have a Dream\" speech from the steps of the Capitol, and stood beside his boss in the Capitol rotunda as the Voting Rights Act was signed into law. Mitch McConnell as a young senator After graduating from the University of Kentucky Law School, where he led the Student Bar Association, he went on to serve as an assistant attorney general under President Gerald Ford. In 1977, he successfully ran for judge-executive, the top political office in his home county in Kentucky. He has never lost an election since. As a young Republican from what was then a Democratic-leaning state, Mr McConnell was far more of a pragmatic centrist than he is today. When he won his first Senate race, upsetting a Democratic incumbent in 1984, it was the first time a Republican had won state-wide in Kentucky in 16 years. In the Senate, Mr McConnell gradually shifted toward the conservatism pulling his state and his party to the right. He had been supported by labour groups in his early career, but he turned his back on fights for collective bargaining rights and minimum wage increases. Under the banner of free speech, he fiercely resisted efforts to limit spending on political campaigns. And as a representative for coal-rich Kentucky, he vocally denied the impacts of global warming for years and opposed climate regulations he often claimed were a threat to the economy. In 1993, Mr McConnell married Elaine Chao, a Taiwanese-American immigrant who later joined the cabinet of Presidents George W Bush and Donald Trump. Mr McConnell with his wife Elaine Chao His profile grew after he was elected by his Republican colleagues in 2006 to lead their Senate caucus. As Barack Obama entered the White House, and the populist Tea Party movement reshaped the Republican Party in its anti-establishment, norm-breaking image, Mr McConnell took the hint. He railed against the president's signature healthcare and financial reforms, and set records with his use of a procedural tool called the filibuster to thwart the Obama agenda, helping transform a collegial Senate into the fiercely partisan chamber it is today. In 2010, he made headlines when he famously declared his party's \"number one priority\" was to make Mr Obama a one-term president. But he also knew when to reach across the aisle for compromise. In 2012, he cut an 11th-hour deal with then-Vice President Joe Biden to save the country from a catastrophic default on its public debt. The following year, his meetings with Democratic leaders helped end a government shutdown. Republicans retook control of the Senate in 2014 and Mr McConnell fulfilled his dream of becoming the chamber's majority leader. The pattern of Mr McConnell routinely blocking Democratic-led initiatives in the Senate has earned him the moniker of the \"Grim Reaper\", a nickname he embraces. Perhaps his most famous act of obstruction came in 2016 when he refused to allow Mr Obama, in his final year in office, to fill a vacant Supreme Court seat. The move infuriated Democrats, but paid off the following year when the newly elected President Trump filled the seat with a conservative jurist. The Trump years saw two more justices added to the nation's top court, cementing a 6-3 conservative majority that has since made consequential rulings on abortion, gun rights and several other issues. The majority leader's intense focus on transforming the judiciary also contributed to Mr Trump appointing more than 200 new federal judges during his four-year term. Mr McConnell had a consequential, albeit uneasy, alliance with President Donald Trump But the McConnell-Trump alliance was uneasy from the outset and their increasing disagreements burst into the open after the then-president falsely claimed the 2020 election was stolen from him. Mr McConnell slammed him as being \"morally responsible\" for the January 2021 attack on the US Capitol, although he did not vote to impeach Mr Trump over it. The feud has only intensified since then, with Mr Trump attacking Mr McConnell's wife and the senator mocking his \"diminished\" status. Mr McConnell has never faced serious opposition for his Senate seat or his leadership role, but surveys show he is one of the most unpopular politicians in the country. His tactics have earned him few Democratic fans, though one Kentucky colleague once described him as \"the Tiger Woods of politics\", while the right flank of his own party increasingly reviles someone they view as an establishment swamp monster. Recently he has advocated rather forcefully for his party to keep defending Ukraine in its war against Russia and to turn away from its Trumpian inclinations towards a platform with broader appeal to voters. But like the presidential front-runners, he has faced increasing questions about his health and advancing age. This video can not be played Watch: McConnell freezes during press event The lawmaker missed nearly six weeks of Senate votes last year after falling at a DC hotel and suffering a concussion. US media also reported on three other falls in 2023, with NBC News reporting he sometimes uses a wheelchair to navigate airports. And in two other incidents, he froze abruptly at press conferences. On both occasions, his office said he had simply paused because he \"felt light-headed\". The reports led to speculation about whether he was still capable of the job. But it now appears that instead of facing another leadership contest after the upcoming elections, he has decided to give up the post at a time of his own choosing. Mr McConnell has, however, said he will serve out the remainder of his Senate term, which runs until January 2027.

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Mitch McConnell (born February 20, 1942, Tuscumbia, Alabama, U.S.) is an influential Republican politician who has represented Kentucky in the U.S. Senate since 1985. The longest-serving Senate party leader, McConnell has been the majority whip (2003–07), minority leader (2007–15; 2021– ), and majority leader (2015–21). In 2024 he announced that he would be stepping down as minority leader later that year. During his early childhood, McConnell was afflicted with, but eventually overcame, polio. His family moved from Alabama to Louisville, Kentucky, when he was 13. He graduated from the University of Louisville in 1964 and from the University of Kentucky Law School in 1967. From 1968 to 1970 McConnell was a legislative assistant to U.S. Sen. Marlow Cook. He later served as deputy assistant U.S. attorney general in the administration of Pres. Gerald R. Ford (1974–75) and as judge/executive (chief judge) of Jefferson county, Kentucky (1978–85). McConnell was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1984, becoming the first Republican since 1968 to win a statewide election in Kentucky. As chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee in 1995, he garnered national attention for resisting Democratic attempts to investigate sexual assault accusations against Republican Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon. In a speech on the Senate floor, McConnell threatened to launch investigations into Democratic politicians who had faced similar charges in the past, among them Sen. Ted Kennedy. His Democratic colleagues prevailed, however, and McConnell publicly changed his mind about Packwood, who resigned later that year under the weight of evidence against him. McConnell earned a reputation as a tough opponent of campaign finance reform and campaign spending limits. From the 1990s he consistently voted against a series of such measures, including some sponsored by fellow Republicans. When a popular bipartisan measure sponsored by Republican Sen. John McCain and Democratic Sen. Russell D. Feingold was signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2002, McConnell promptly sued the Federal Election Commission, calling the law a violation of free speech. In a December 2003 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law. In subsequent years McConnell showed greater willingness to compromise. In 2005 he served on a bipartisan Senate committee that made recommendations for broad changes to the Department of Homeland Security, the government agency charged with protecting the country against terrorist attacks in the wake of the September 11 attacks of 2001. The following year he introduced a compromise bill that brought the Republican and Democratic parties closer to agreement about which interrogation techniques could be used by U.S. authorities on detainees held as suspected terrorists or terrorist sympathizers. In 2007, however, as the newly elected Senate minority leader, McConnell opposed Democratic calls to set in place a timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (see Iraq War), arguing that it was not within the power of Congress to make such a judgment. Following the 2008 election of Pres. Barack Obama, McConnell coordinated the Republicans’ efforts in the Senate, opposing (unsuccessfully) Democratic legislation to reform health care and the financial sector. The Republicans made significant gains in the 2010 midterm elections, and much of their initial focus turned to the federal deficit. In May 2011 McConnell joined other Republicans in announcing that he would not vote to raise the national debt ceiling unless various programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, underwent spending cuts. Without an increase to the debt limit, the government faced defaulting on its public debt. McConnell became a key figure in drafting a bipartisan deal that included significant cuts but no changes to the various entitlement programs. In addition, tax increases, which McConnell and the Republicans opposed, were also absent. Over the next several years, McConnell helped block a number of Democrat-led initiatives, including gun-control measures and increases to the minimum wage. Although some criticized his party’s use of the filibuster, he argued that Democrats refused to negotiate. After the Republicans regained control of the Senate in the 2014 midterm elections, McConnell was named majority leader. In 2016 McConnell caused controversy when he refused to bring Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, to a vote in the Senate. McConnell claimed that because it was an election year, the vacancy should remain open until a new president was inaugurated. During the 2016 presidential race, he supported the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, who was eventually elected. One of Trump’s first acts as president was to nominate Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. In April 2017 McConnell oversaw a change to the Senate rules that did away with the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees, and Gorsuch was confirmed by a vote of 54–45. Under McConnell the Senate approved numerous other Trump judicial nominees, including two other Supreme Court justices, Brett Kavanaugh (2018) and Amy Coney Barrett (2020). Both confirmations were contentious, with Barrett’s being particularly controversial as it came in an election year. The majority leader also backed various policies supported by the president, perhaps most notably a massive tax-reform bill that was passed in 2017. In September 2019 the U.S. House of Representatives launched an impeachment inquiry against Trump following allegations that he had extorted a foreign country to investigate Joe Biden, his political rival (in 2020 Biden became the Democratic presidential nominee). Three months later the House convicted the president on two charges: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. While McConnell stated that he would hold a trial, he attracted controversy when he announced that he was coordinating with the White House about the proceedings. The trial opened in January 2020, and McConnell was credited with keeping the Republicans unified, especially in defeating a motion to call witnesses. In February the Senate easily acquitted the president. Shortly thereafter schools and businesses began closing across the country because of the coronavirus pandemic, and the economy entered a downturn that rivaled the Great Depression. In late March McConnell oversaw the Senate’s approval of a relief bill that was later signed into law. The 2020 election was held in November amid this health crisis, and Biden defeated Trump; the fate of the Senate remained uncertain as both of Georgia’s senatorial races moved to runoffs. Trump contested the presidential election results, alleging voter fraud despite a lack of evidence. McConnell refused to push back against Trump’s claims and did not acknowledge Biden’s win until mid-December. That development came as McConnell attempted to halt a growing effort among Republicans to overturn the election. On January 5, 2021, both Democratic candidates won in Georgia, creating a 50–50 tie in the Senate; however, with an incoming Democratic vice president as the tiebreaker, Republicans became the minority party. The next day Congress convened to certify Biden’s victory, and McConnell—who remained majority leader, awaiting the swearing in of the new senators from Georgia—gave an impassioned speech against overturning the results, stating that to do so would send the country’s democracy into a “death spiral.” Shortly thereafter the proceedings were halted as Trump supporters stormed the Capitol. It took several hours to secure the building, but the certification eventually took place. Many accused Trump of encouraging the attack—McConnell later said the president “provoked” it—and on January 13, 2021, the House impeached Trump for a second time, charging him with “incitement of insurrection.” At the time, the Senate was in recess, and McConnell refused to reconvene early to hold the impeachment trial. Instead, senators returned on January 19, and McConnell became minority leader on January 20, the same day Trump left office. On February 9 the Senate trial began, and McConnell later voted to acquit Trump, arguing that they had “no power to convict and disqualify a former officeholder who is now a private citizen”; Trump was ultimately acquitted. However, McConnell subsequently claimed that the former president was “practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day.” From 1968 to 1980 McConnell was married to Sherrill Redmon, with whom he had three children. He later wed (1993) Elaine Chao, who subsequently served as secretary of labor under Pres. George W. Bush and secretary of transportation under Pres. Donald Trump.",

                "content": "Jimmy Butler III (born September 14, 1989) is an American professional basketball player for the Miami Heat of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed \"Jimmy Buckets\", he is a six-time NBA All-Star, a five-time All-NBA Team member, and a five-time NBA All-Defensive Team member. He won a gold medal as a member of the 2016 U.S. Olympic team. Butler played one year of college basketball for Tyler Junior College before transferring to Marquette University. He was selected with the 30th overall pick in the 2011 NBA draft by the Chicago Bulls. In 2015, he was named the NBA Most Improved Player. After six seasons in Chicago, he was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves in June 2017, and was then again traded in November 2018, this time to the Philadelphia 76ers. In July 2019, he signed with the Heat. During his first season with the team, Butler reached the NBA Finals. In 2021, he led the league in steals. In 2023, Butler and the eighth-seeded Heat played in the 2023 NBA Finals, their second appearance in four years. Butler was born in Houston on September 14, 1989.[1][2] His father, Jimmy Butler Jr., left the family when Butler was an infant. When he was 13 years old and living in the Houston suburb of Tomball, his mother kicked him out of the house. As Butler remembered it in a 2011 interview, she told him, \"I don't like the look of you. You gotta go.\" He moved between the homes of various friends, staying for a few weeks at a time before moving to another house.[3] Butler maintains a relationship with his parents, saying, \"I don't hold grudges. I still talk to my family. My mom. My father. We love each other. That's never going to change.\"[4][5] In a summer basketball league before his senior year at Tomball High School, he was noticed by Jordan Leslie, a freshman football and basketball player at the school, who challenged him to a three-point shooting contest. The two became friends, and Butler stayed at Leslie's house for a few months, Leslie's mother and stepfather had six other children between them. Butler would later say, \"They accepted me into their family. And it wasn't because of basketball. She [Michelle Lambert, Leslie's mother] was just very loving. She just did stuff like that. I couldn't believe it.\"[3] As a junior at Tomball High, Butler averaged 10 points per game. As a senior and team captain in 2006–07, Butler averaged 19.9 points and 8.7 rebounds per game and was subsequently voted his team's most valuable player. Butler was not recruited coming out of high school and chose to attend Tyler Junior College in Tyler, Texas. After his freshman season at Tyler Junior College, where he had averaged 18.1 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 3.1 assists per game, Butler received interest from Division I programs. Considered a two-star recruit by 247Sports.com,[6] he was listed as the No. 127 junior college prospect in 2008.[7] Butler accepted an athletic scholarship to attend Marquette, where, as a sophomore in the 2008–09 season, he averaged 5.6 points and 3.9 rebounds per game and recorded a free-throw percentage of 76.8%. He moved into the starting lineup as a junior during the 2009–10 season to average 14.7 points and 6.4 rebounds per game and received All-Big East Honorable Mention honors. Butler had two game-winning shots versus UConn and St. John's, to help Marquette finish 11–7 in the Big East and earn its fifth consecutive NCAA tournament appearance. As a senior in 2010–11, he averaged 15.7 points per game and received All-Big East Honorable Mention for the second straight year.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. FRISCO, Texas -- Things have not gone well for the Dallas Cowboys this year, especially in the injury department. And they got even worse on that front Monday night. Linebacker DeMarvion Overshown, who has been one of the team's few bright spots this season, suffered a knee injury early in the fourth quarter of the Cowboys' \"Monday Night Football\" loss against the Bengals. That injury will require surgery and put an end to his season, owner Jerry Jones told 105.3 The Fan on Tuesday. And according to coach Mike McCarthy, there's a chance Overshown misses the entire 2025 season, too. \"DeMarvion is getting ready to have a big surgery in front of him,\" McCarthy said Tuesday. \"Significant knee injury. You could feel it on the sidelines. Just being on the field for part of the exam, I knew it was serious. but, obviously, his physical and football talents speak for itself. He's just such a bright light. He's got a great, infectious personality. Tough, tough young man. We're definitely going to miss him. He's got a long road of rehab in front of him. He will obviously be loved and supported every step of the way.\" ESPN reported on Tuesday that Overshown tore his ACL, MCL and PCL. With that severe of an injury, McCarthy felt it was \"fair\" to say Overshown could miss the entire 2025 season given how late in 2024 his knee injury occurred. \"I think that's fair. The time of year. Obviously we're in December. I think like anything, you have the surgery and the rehab is a long process. I think that's very realistic,\" McCarthy said. Overshown got rolled up on by multiple players while trying to wade through the muck and make a tackle, and his right knee got pinned under the scrum of bodies. Overshown, who missed his entire rookie season with a torn left ACL, was helped off the field by trainers and quickly ruled out. After the game, McCarthy labeled the injury as serious while adding that the initial reports did not look encouraging. Cowboys linebacker Micah Parsons was reduced to tears when discussing Overshown's injury. \"He's like my little bro,\" Parsons said. \"He don't deserve that, he really don't. To understand what he's going to have to have to go through. ... He's so talented, the year he was having. I really don't think it's fair.\" The 24-year-old linebacker ends his 2024 season with 90 tackles, five sacks, an interception, a pick-six, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery for a Cowboys team that has dealt with a barrage of injuries on both sides of the ball. Prior to getting hurt, Overshown had a key pass breakup that forced a turnover on downs. \"We're just seeing the tip of the iceberg, really,\" McCarthy recently said of Overshown. \"I'm so impressed with him, and in his consistency, in his approach, and that's just going to keep putting him in the position to progress.\" Dallas defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer sees parallels between Overshown and Cowboys Ring of Honor defensive back Darren Woodson. \"Different positions, but kind of like Darren Woodson. Just the impact, the different things he can do and the speed that he has and physicality,\" Zimmer said of Overshown on Tuesday. \"He would probably be the closest that I can think of off the top of my head.\" © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

Cowboys linebacker DeMarvion Overshown left in the fourth quarter of Dallas' 27-20 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals with what head coach Mike McCarthy described as a knee injury of 'serious nature.' When Micah Parsons and DeMarvion Overshown have shared the field in 2024 for the Cowboys, it's led to good defense being played, and highlight plays being made. As each game goes by, DeMarvion Overshown seemingly finds a new way to produce a \"wow\" play for the Dallas defense, and is establishing his identity as one of their best players. He's not only impacting games for the Dallas Cowboys but, as seen in the Thanksgiving win over the Giants, DeMarvion Overshown is a force of nature. DeMarvion Overshown is flying around in Dallas' defense in his first NFL season, and doesn't look to be slowing down anytime soon. The Cowboys have shown improvements defensively in 'spurts' over the last few weeks, but now they need to find consistency. Things didn't end well for the Dallas Cowboys against the Philadelphia Eagles, but what DeMarvion Overshown did can not be dismissed or overlooked.

The Cowboys were able to use a \"spy\" on defense for a running QB in Cleveland, although Sunday will be a different beast in Lamar Jackson. Do the Cowboys have plans to use a spy again? Welcome to \"The Science Lab\", a place where football facts and in-depth analysis always triumph over feelings. The things DeMarvion Overshown put on film in his NFL debut against the Cleveland Browns has the Dallas Cowboys grinning from ear to ear, but he's already moving on to Week 2. Among the Cowboys players making their NFL debuts, who had the most impact in the win at Cleveland? The season opener will mark the first time DeMarvion Overshown and Marist Liufau take the field for the Dallas Cowboys, and they provided deep insight into the outlook versus the Browns. It's been a long journey back for DeMarvion Overshown, but he's locked and loaded for his first NFL regular season game for the Dallas Cowboys — a lifelong dream made true. Almost a year removed from a season-ending torn ACL in the preseason, DeMarvion Overshown reflected on his journey back to the field on Sunday afternoon. With the team getting settled into padded practices in Oxnard, Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones called out a few early training camp favorites. There is a ton of excitement beaming from the aura of DeMarvion Overshown as he prepares to put the pads back on for the Dallas Cowboys in his return from injury. DeMarvion Overshown made his return on Thursday from a torn ACL suffered last preseason, as he takes a more developed game on and off the field into Oxnard. DeMarvion Overshown is returning from a devastating injury as a second-year player and Damone Clark can empathize — offering priceless advice to his fellow linebacker. From the addition of Erick Kendricks to the return of DeMarvion Overshown and lots in-between, the linebackers group owns a laundry list of questions on the Dallas Cowboys' depth chart. When last DeMarvion Overshown took to the practice field, he was lighter and leaner than the version the Dallas Cowboys will see in 2024 training camp, in his return from injury. With OTAs beginning on Tuesday, head coach Mike McCarthy shared the latest on the injury front with multiple players on both sides of the ball. A few players have switched jersey numbers this offseason, including Jalen Tolbert, who has moved to No. 1, along with a couple of linebackers that went into the teens.

Tags: The Federal Trade Commission today sued to block the largest proposed supermarket merger in U.S. history—Kroger Company’s $24.6 billion acquisition of the Albertsons Companies, Inc.—alleging that the deal is anticompetitive. The FTC charges that the proposed deal will eliminate fierce competition between Kroger and Albertsons, leading to higher prices for groceries and other essential household items for millions of Americans. The loss of competition will also lead to lower quality products and services, while also narrowing consumers’ choices for where to shop for groceries. For thousands of grocery store workers, Kroger’s proposed acquisition of Albertsons would immediately erase aggressive competition for workers, threatening the ability of employees to secure higher wages, better benefits, and improved working conditions. “This supermarket mega merger comes as American consumers have seen the cost of groceries rise steadily over the past few years. Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons would lead to additional grocery price hikes for everyday goods, further exacerbating the financial strain consumers across the country face today,” said Henry Liu, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition. “Essential grocery store workers would also suffer under this deal, facing the threat of their wages dwindling, benefits diminishing, and their working conditions deteriorating.” The FTC issued an administrative complaint and authorized a lawsuit in federal court to block the proposed acquisition pending the Commission’s administrative proceedings. A bipartisan group of nine attorneys general is joining the FTC’s federal court complaint. Kroger operates thousands of stores across 36 states, which includes regional banners such as Fred Meyer, Fry’s, Harris Teeter, King Soopers, Kroger, and Quality Food Centers (QFC). Albertsons also operates thousands of stores across 35 states under regional names including Albertsons, Haggen, Jewel-Osco, Pavilions, Safeway, and Vons. If the merger were completed, Kroger and Albertsons would operate more than 5,000 stores and approximately 4,000 retail pharmacies and would employ nearly 700,000 employees across 48 states. Executives for both Kroger and Albertsons have acknowledged that the two supermarkets are direct competitors, forcing each other to aggressively compete for customers by lowering prices and for employees by providing better pay and benefits across the country. Similarly, executives for both supermarket chains have conceded that Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons is anticompetitive, with one executive reacting candidly to the proposed deal: “you are basically creating a monopoly in grocery with the merger.” Inadequate Divestiture Offering To try to secure antitrust approval of their merger, Kroger and Albertsons have proposed to divest several hundred stores and select other assets to C&S Wholesale Grocers (C&S), which today operates just 23 supermarkets and a single retail pharmacy. The FTC’s administrative complaint alleges that Kroger and Albertsons’s inadequate divestiture proposal is a hodgepodge of unconnected stores, banners, brands, and other assets that Kroger’s antitrust lawyers have cobbled together and falls far short of mitigating the lost competition between Kroger and Albertsons. The FTC says the proposed divestitures are not a standalone business, and C&S would face significant obstacles stitching together the various parts and pieces from Kroger and Albertsons into a functioning business—let alone a successful competitor against a combined Kroger and Albertsons. The proposal completely ignores many affected regional and local markets where Kroger and Albertsons compete today. In areas where there are divestitures, the proposal fails to include all of the assets, resources, and capabilities that C&S would need to replicate the competitive intensity that exists today between Kroger and Albertsons. Even if C&S were to survive as an operator, Kroger and Albertsons’s proposed divestitures still do not solve the multitude of competitive issues created by the proposed acquisition, according to the complaint. Harm to Consumers In addition to raising grocery prices, the FTC alleges that Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons would also diminish their incentive to compete on quality. Today, Kroger and Albertsons compete to improve their stores in many ways, including offering fresher produce, higher quality products, improved private label offerings, a broader array of in-store services, flexible store and pharmacy hours, and curbside pickup services. The FTC charges that the deal would eliminate head-to-head price and quality competition, which have driven both supermarkets to lower their prices and improve their product and service offerings. If the merger takes place, grocery prices will increase, and Kroger and Albertsons’ incentive to improve product quality and customer service will decrease, further harming customers. Harm to Workers Kroger and Albertsons are the two largest employers of union grocery labor in the United States. They actively compete against one another for workers. The two companies also try to poach grocery workers from each other, especially in local markets where they overlap. Currently, most workers for both supermarket chains are members of the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) union. Today, UFCW and other unions leverage the fact that Kroger and Albertsons are separate and competing companies. Unions push for both supermarket chains to negotiate better employment terms for union grocery workers, especially when negotiating over collective bargaining agreements (CBAs). A combined Kroger/Albertsons, however, would gain increased leverage over workers and their unions—to the detriment of workers, the FTC alleges. The combined Kroger and Albertsons would have more leverage to impose subpar terms on union grocery workers that slow improvements to wages, worsen benefits, and potentially degrade working conditions. In some regions, such as in Denver, the combined Kroger/Albertsons would be the only employer of union grocery labor. Union grocery workers ability to leverage the threat of a boycott or strike to negotiate better CBA terms would also be weakened. The Offices of the Attorneys General of Arizona, California, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, and Wyoming are joining the Commission’s federal lawsuit. The Commission vote to issue the administrative complaint and authorize staff to seek a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction in federal district court was 3-0. The federal court complaint and request for preliminary relief will be filed jointly with the state attorneys general in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon. NOTE: The Commission issues an administrative complaint when it has “reason to believe” that the law has been or is being violated, and it appears to the Commission that a proceeding is in the public interest. The issuance of the administrative complaint marks the beginning of a proceeding in which the allegations will be tried in a formal hearing before an administrative law judge. The Federal Trade Commission works to promote competition, and protect and educate consumers. The FTC will never demand money, make threats, tell you to transfer money, or promise you a prize.

        "Luigi Mangione": [
            {
                "title": "Live updates: The arrest of Luigi Mangione, the UnitedHeathcare CEO shooting suspect | CNN",
                "content": "Live Updates • Luigi Mangione, the suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, is fighting his extradition to New York, where he faces a murder charge. He was denied bail during a court appearance in Pennsylvania. • As he entered the courtroom Tuesday, the 26-year-old could be heard yelling, in part, “it’s completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people. It’s lived experience!” • Mangione was arrested on a gun charge Monday after being picked up while eating at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, following a call to the police by an employee, the NYPD chief of detectives said. The 26-year-old had multiple fake IDs and a 3D-printed gun with a suppressor, according to officials. Tom Dickey, Luigi Mangione’s lawyer, told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins Tuesday night his staff informed him that he’s received some emails of people offering to help pay for Mangione’s legal bills. “I have received some emails. I have not seen them personally, but my understanding from my staff is people are doing that,” Dickey said while also saying he “probably wouldn’t” accept the offers. “Obviously my client appreciates the support that he has, but I don’t know, … it just doesn’t sit right with me.” The emailed offers come as Mangione has received sympathy on social media and has even been referred to as a “hero” in relation to the country’s growing frustration of its health care system. Dickey also said during his interview Tuesday that he’s not convinced New York officials have the right guy as Mangione fights his extradition to the state where he faces five charges, including murder. “I haven’t seen any evidence that they have the right guy,” Dickey said, adding that New York officials “need to convince me.” Similar to what he did in an earlier news conference Tuesday, Dickey would not comment on who retained him to represent Mangione. Luigi Mangione, the suspect in the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, was found carrying a “ghost gun” at the time of his arrest, according to police. CNN’s Josh Campbell explains what ghost guns are and why they’re nearly undetectable to law enforcement. Former classmates of suspected shooter Luigi Mangione are finding it hard to believe he is accused of killing United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson on a New York sidewalk. Two fraternity brothers of Mangione shared their shock with CNN, one saying it was “unbelievable” that he was the suspect. Neither recalled Mangione making any extreme or concerning comments in the years that they knew him. Mangione played video games and watched sports with others but dedicated most of his free time to his coursework. “I feel like it’s a cliché, everybody is like, ‘He was a quiet guy,’ but like he was even more normal than that,” one of the men said. Another University of Pennsylvania classmate remembered Mangione as a “totally normal guy,” while a former roommate told CNN they didn’t really discuss politics but “he was clearly a thoughtful guy.” Freddie Leatherbury, who went to an all-boys private school with Mangione, told CNN that his classmate “had everything going for him. But he wasn’t really snobby. He was humble. He was unassuming and easy to approach.” Another high school classmate said he was stunned when the 26-year-old who grew up in Maryland was named as the suspect. The former classmate, who asked not to be named, described Mangione as a brilliant person who could write a 20-page thesis on the night before it was due and be awarded the prize for best paper. “If I opened my yearbook and was asked, ‘Who are your favorite people in your class?’ He would have been like in the top 10 or 15. He’s a great guy,” he told CNN by phone. “He was just somebody who… I mean, his brain was just like next level.” CNN’s Emma Tucker, Curt Devine, Sabrina Shulman and Jennifer Sherwood contributed. There is body camera footage of the encounter between Altoona Police Department members and shooting suspect Luigi Mangione, according to Altoona Deputy Chief of Police Derek Swope. “There is bodycam video. At this point, it’s not gonna be released,” Swope told reporters Tuesday. Mangione, the suspect in the shooting of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson, was arrested at a McDonald’s in Altoona on Monday. Community members as well as police officers in Altoona, Pennsylvania, are receiving threats in the wake of Luigi Mangione’s capture, Altoona Deputy Chief of Police Derek Swope told reporters Tuesday. “We have received some threats against our officers in building here. We’ve started investigating some threats against some citizens in our community,” Swope said. “We’re taking all those threats seriously.” Swope also called Mangione’s case “polarizing.” Mangione, the suspect in the killing in New York of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson, was arrested Monday at a McDonald’s in Altoona, which is about 100 miles east of Pittsburgh. Luigi Mangione, the suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, is fighting against his extradition to New York and it could take weeks before authorities can bring him to the state for prosecution, according to Karen Agnifilo, a CNN legal analyst and defense attorney. There could be several reasons why Mangione is fighting his extradition, according to Agnifilo. It allows him more time to think about his defense, demand prosecutors present more evidence at his next hearing or try to get bail in Pennsylvania, which is unlikely, said Agnifilo, who previously worked at the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office. Most criminal defendants facing prosecution on more serious charges in another state waive their right to extradition, but in murder cases like Mangione’s, “there’s no chance he’s going to be let out, so he’s fighting extradition,” she said. “Eight or nine out of 10 times, defendants wave extradition because they realize this is so perfunctory, it’s so easy, and most of them don’t want to languish in detention in the other state because you don’t even get to fight your case yet,” Agnifilo said, adding that most of the time defendants waive their bail to start the process of getting bail. Mangione was denied bail during his extradition court hearing in Pennsylvania on Tuesday and faces five charges in New York, including murder, according to court documents. He also faces gun charges in Pennsylvania related to the firearm police found on him when he was arrested on Monday. Judge Dave Consiglio gave the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania 30 days to obtain a governor’s warrant and denied bail related to both state dockets, saying Mangione would remain at SCI Huntingdon. After the warrant is obtained, Agnifilo said it can take up to two months before authorities can bring Mangione back to New York. A book published in 2010 critical of the US insurance industry — and whose title appears similar to words found on shell casings near where UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was killed — has risen to number two on Amazon’s nonfiction best sellers list. The book, “Delay, Deny, Defend: Why Insurance Companies Don’t Pay Claims and What You Can Do About It,” by legal scholar Jay Feinman, has gained resurgent interest online. It comes after people compared the book’s title and subject matter to the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” written on shell casings near the site of Thompson’s death, according to police. The New York Police Department have not confirmed a direct link between the book’s subject and the motivation in the killing of Thompson. “Delay, deny, defend” is a popular term to describe tactics used in the insurance industry to reject claims. An account saying it belongs to Feinman, who is a professor emeritus at Rutgers University, posted on X on December 6 that the paperback book was out of stock on Amazon and offered bulk orders on his website. “Because folks have been asking: Delay, Deny, Defend paperback out of stock on Amazon,” the account holder wrote, noting that there would be a restock soon. Feinman and Amazon declined CNN’s request for comment. Responses on X ranged from thanking Feinman for the book to criticizing him for the post. Chris Kwock told CNN affiliate KGMB that Luigi Mangione lived next to him in their building in Honolulu, Hawaii. Kwock said he last saw his neighbor about three to four months ago. Kwock said he asked Mangione where he had been for the past six months and he said he was on the mainland for “medical stuff.” Mangione didn’t complain about his medical issue, Kwock said. He said he didn’t recognize Mangione when he saw photos on the news. “I wouldn’t even think about someone living next to me in Hawaii, across the state or across the US (being the suspect),” he said. After police found the words “deny,” “defend” and “depose” printed on shell casings near the site where UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was gunned down, merchandise bearing those words started to appear online. The phrase might be linked to a 2010 book critiquing the health insurance industry titled, “Delay Deny Defend,” a common description of the industry’s tactics. Those words appeared on a number of items on Amazon’s store, including hats, T-shirts and pint glasses. The suspect in the case has garnered sympathy and online fandom partly because of people’s problems with the health insurance industry. The majority of insured US adults had at least one issue, including denial of claims, with their health insurance in the span of a year, according to a survey released in June 2023 by KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group. Amazon has pulled the merchandise from the website for violating the company’s rules, according to a person familiar with Amazon’s decision making. It’s unclear how many people bought items emblazoned with the phrase. However, “deny, defend, depose” merchandise remains on sale on eBay. The phrase itself doesn’t violate its rules, but “items that glorify or incite violence, including those that celebrate the recent murder of UHC CEO Brian Thompson, are prohibited,” a company spokesperson told CNN. Read more here about how companies are trying to stop online support for the suspect An online blogger who corresponded for months with Luigi Mangione said the UnitedHealthcare shooting suspect expressed a diverse range of political viewpoints, including support for a nationalized healthcare system. Mangione was a subscriber to Gurwinder Bhogal’s Substack, “The Prism,” and the two corresponded this past spring. They held a two-hour video chat in May, when Mangione said he was in Japan, and exchanged almost 20 emails and direct messages on X and Substack, Bhogal told CNN. He says Mangione told him he subscribed to his blog after reading an August 2023 article where Bhogal explained “how people today live in rigid tribes.” Mangione, Bhogal said, appreciated how he identified how individuals could express varying opinions, depending on the issue. “This seemed to resonate with Luigi because he was also left-wing on some things and right-wing on others,” Bhogal told CNN in an email. “For instance, he was pro-equality (of opportunity) but anti-woke (i.e. anti-DEI, anti-identity politics). He opposed wokeism because he didn’t believe it was an effective way to help minorities.” The two also discussed healthcare. Bhogal, who is based in the United Kingdom, said Mangione complained how expensive healthcare was in the US and “expressed envy at the UK’s nationalized health system.” Bhogal says he only vaguely remembers Mangione discussing a back injury he sustained while surfing in Hawaii. Their last correspondence was in June. “He was so thoughtful and polite,” said Bhogal, who described himself as bewildered when he saw Mangione’s name as the suspect in the shooting of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson. “He seemed like the last person I’d suspect of murdering someone.” Along with a three-page handwritten “claim of responsibility,” as police characterized Luigi Mangione’s manifesto, investigators are also looking at pages of notes in a spiral notebook that the 26-year-old wrote in, a law enforcement source briefed on the matter told CNN. It included to-do lists of tasks that needed to be completed to facilitate a killing, as well as notes justifying those plans, the source said. In one notebook passage, Mangione wrote about the Unabomber who CNN has previously reported Mangione wrote about in posts online as well. In the passage in the notebook, Mangione concludes that using a bomb against his intended victim “could kill innocents” but shooting would be more targeted, musing what could be better than “to kill the CEO at his own bean counting conference.” Police have previously stated that after arriving in New York on November 24, Mangione allegedly took a cab to the New York Hilton to begin his reconnaissance and planning of the assassination. Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, will fight extradition to New York. He appeared at an extradition hearing today at the Blair County Courthouse in Pennsylvania after New York prosecutors charged him with murder, among other counts, related to the deadly shooting in Manhattan last week. Here’s the latest on the case: Luigi Mangione’s former classmate said he thought the suspected shooter of CEO Brian Thompson was “totally brilliant” when they were in high school in Baltimore. “He was the kind of kid who would like, just show up to class, never open a book after and aced the test,” the classmate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CNN in a phone call. He said Mangione, who joined the Gilman School in 6th grade comes from a “really good family,” and recalls Mangione saying on their senior year retreat that he was “really impressed with his grandfather’s legacy and had a strong family relationship because of that patriarch unit,” said the classmate. The suspect’s grandfather, Nicholas Mangione, a former masonry contractor who told the Baltimore Sun he started working at age 11, built a local real estate empire that included nursing home facilities around Maryland and two country clubs in the Baltimore suburbs. In 10th grade, students were given three months to write a lengthy, up to 20 page-long, thesis paper, the classmate said, and Mangione wrote his on the night before and was awarded a prize for the “best paper written.” “He was extraordinary. His friend group, I’d say was a bit nerdier and like more reserved, but Luigi was somebody that, socially, was very approachable and not confined to his close group of friends,” said the classmate. “He played soccer. He was decently athletic.” The classmate said he was “shocked” when Mangione’s identity was released on Monday and hadn’t seen the photo before then. “When I got the early text that it’s Luigi, I was just in shock. Not only because of the relationship but it’s obviously shocking that type of person would commit it… Somebody that comes from a lot of money and had a lot to offer.” “I’m saddened by the whole thing,” he added. Luigi Mangione’s defense attorney said he told his client to be quiet while they were in court for an extradition hearing in Pennsylvania this afternoon. Defense lawyer Tom Dickey said Mangione, who is accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, “shut his mouth” after he told him to keep quiet. “Which is good, that’s what he needs to do,” Dickey said, adding that his comment to his client came after he thought he heard his voice. Asked if he was aware of what Mangione yelled as he arrived to court this afternoon, Dickey said that he “heard some different versions of that, so I need to see what that statement was.” “Hopefully there won’t be anymore of that,” he said. Mangione could be heard yelling, in part, “it’s completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people. It’s lived experience” as he was being escorted out of the car and into the building. Defense attorney Tom Dickey said he anticipates a not guilty plea for Luigi Mangione’s murder charge. “From what I’ve seen, up to this point, he hasn’t been charged with that,” Dickey said. “I don’t really want to speculate, but if in fact that would happen, I would anticipate a plea of not guilty.” Dickey also said it’s “a possibility” he could represent Mangione in New York. The suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson may have suffered a back injury on July 4, 2023, New York Police Chief of Detectives Joe Kenny told Fox News on Tuesday afternoon. “Some of the writings that he had, he was discussing the difficulty of sustaining that injury,” Kenny said of evidence related to the suspect, Luigi Mangione. “So, we’re looking into whether or not the insurance industry either denied a claim from him or didn’t help him out to the fullest extent.” Kenny said investigators have looked at a handwritten document that was found with the suspect when he was arrested Monday and his social media postings. Mangione was aware UnitedHealthcare was holding an investors’ conference around the time Thompson was shot and killed — and the suspect mentions he will be going to the conference site, according to the document, the chief of detectives said. Thompson normally had his own security with him when at home in Minnesota, but chose not to while in New York, Kenny said. Police received 200 tips about the shooting, but none named Mangione, Kenny added. The defense attorney for the suspect in the shooting death of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO said he believes the judge in the case should have set bail for his client. At an extradition hearing earlier today, the judge denied bail to Luigi Mangione. His lawyer, Tom Dickey, argued that in Pennsylvania, most crimes are a “bailable offense” which means “you have to set some form of bail,” with the exception of capital cases. Mangione faces a second degree murder charge, among others in New York, as well as charges in Pennsylvania related to a gun and fake ID police found when they arrested him. “To simply say no bail, with all due respect to the judge, I believe bail should have been set,” Dickey told reporters on Tuesday.“The judge could set $1 million bail. It could be $5 million bail, but damn it, you get bail. That’s what you do,” he said. Luigi Mangione will be pleading not guilty to the charges he faces in Pennsylvania, his defense attorney, Tom Dickey, said Tuesday following Mangione’s extradition hearing. “We’ve pled not guilty, at least to the charges in Pennsylvania. Like I said I’m not aware of any actual charges in New York,” Dickey said.“I’m telling you as his lawyer, he didn’t have any … representation until I got involved this afternoon. And I’m telling you he’s pleading not guilty,” Dickey said. Defense attorney Tom Dickey said Tuesday he has been retained to represent Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Mangione, who is fighting extradition to New York where he faces several charges, including murder, is in custody in Pennsylvania after a judge denied bail earlier today. He also faces charges related to a gun and fake ID police found when they arrested him in the state on Monday. “We’re going to fight this along the rules and with the constitutional protections that my client has,” Dickey said of the fight against extradition. When asked if Mangione’s family retained him, Dickey said, “I’m not going to get into that.” Dickey’s office is located in Altoona, Pennsylvania, according to its website. That is where Mangione was arrested on Monday. Tom Dickey, Luigi Mangione’s lawyer, said he has “made a strong bond” with his client and that he is “pleased” with their relationship. Dickey told reporters on Tuesday that he is “looking forward to moving forward and helping him out.” He said earlier that he had been retained to represent Mangione, who is accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, though he wouldn’t say if he was hired by the family. Remember: Mangione is fighting extradition to New York where he is charged with murder, among other counts, court documents show. He appeared in a Pennsylvania court earlier today for an extradition hearing and was denied bail by the judge. Dickey’s office is located in Altoona, Pennsylvania, according to its website. That is where Mangione was arrested on Monday. Two of Luigi Mangione’s fraternity brothers at the University of Pennsylvania described him as a normal student who got along well in their social circles. Neither of the former classmates, who spoke on the condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the matter, recalled him making any extreme or concerning comments in the years that they knew him. Mangione is the main suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, according to authorities. “It’s unbelievable,” said one of the former classmates, who recalled Mangione watching football and playing video games with members of the fraternity, though he said Mangione spent more time than others on course work because of the rigor of his engineering program. “I feel like it’s a cliché, everybody is like, ‘He was a quiet guy,’ but like he was even more normal than that,” the former classmate said. Another classmate echoed those comments and couldn’t recall any incidents in which Mangione said anything off-putting in the years he knew him, even at their fraternity where many critical discussions took place. The former classmate said he had lost touch with Mangione in recent years. “I know he kind of fell off the radar with everybody,” the former classmate said. Luigi Mangione, the suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has left court for the day. He was denied bail during an appearance at the Blair County Courthouse in Pennsylvania. A former University of Pennsylvania student who took a class where Luigi Mangione was a teacher’s assistant described him as “very smart” and said he did not discuss his political views in their interactions. The student did not want to be named due to the sensitive situation. Mangione, the man suspected of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, was a teacher’s assistant in an introductory computer science class at the Ivy League university in 2019, the student told CNN. “He was definitely very smart, because in order to be a TA of this class, you had to go through a pretty rigorous interview process,” the student said. “It was selective and you were helping students with their homework and also leading the recitation section, which was going over concepts from class.” Mangione and the student had one-on-one interactions, but only in a classroom and office setting, the student said. She said he didn’t discuss his political views. “I do remember talking to him in office hours, asking for homework help, but we were only talking about the homework questions,” she said. “It was definitely shocking and surreal to think that I interacted with him, what, six years ago? Quite a turn of events,” she added. The nationwide manhunt for the suspect who killed UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson ended Monday in perhaps the most quintessentially American location: a McDonald’s. At a news conference Monday, Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said a customer in Altoona, Pennsylvania, recognized a man eating in the restaurant and notified a Mcdonald’s employee, who ultimately called the police “to check it out further.” Police later arrested and charged Luigi Mangione, 26, in connection with the killing of Brian Thompson. The FBI and the NYPD Crime Stoppers Unit had offered a combined reward of up to $60,000 to help capture the suspect in Thompson’s murder. But collecting that money may not be so straightforward. Who can claim the reward money? In the Thompson murder case, it’s possible multiple people could be entitled to claim the reward money. Kaz Daughtry, the NYPD’s deputy commissioner, thanked both the “customer at the McDonald’s” and “the McDonald’s employee that called 911 and reported this individual inside of their restaurant” at a news conference Monday, without naming them. CNN has reached out to both the NYPD and the FBI for information on the rewards, but we may never know who spotted Mangione or called the police. And even if the people involved come forward, it could take months for them to successfully claim the $60,000 reward. How do you get crime tip reward money? Simply reporting a tip or crime is not enough. In this case, the FBI offered a reward “for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the individual responsible” for the crime. Rewards with the NYPD Crime Stoppers Unit hinge on both an arrest and an indictment. In major cases — like those involving international terrorists or people on the FBI Most Wanted List — FBI rewards are paid through the US Rewards for Justice program. In those instances, the individuals who submitted the tip must first be nominated by “a US investigating agency,” like the FBI, and they cannot submit their own names, according to the program. Fortunately, collecting an NYPD Crime Stoppers reward is a bit more straightforward. Rewards are paid by the NYPD Police Foundation. If a tip leads to an “arrest and an indictment,” the information is reviewed by a police foundation committee that decides if the reward should be paid, according to the NYPD Crime Stoppers website. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul plans to submit a warrant for Luigi Mangione’s extradition from Pennsylvania, a spokesperson for her office confirmed to CNN. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office said that it will seek that warrant in order to secure Mangione’s extradition back to the state to face charges for the alleged killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Hochul later confirmed that she is working with Bragg’s office and reiterated that she will “sign a request for a governor’s warrant to ensure this individual is tried and held accountable.” “Public safety is my top priority and I’ll do everything in my power to keep the streets of New York safe,” the governor said in a statement. This post has been updated with a statement from Hochul and CNN’s Celina Tebor contributed reporting. The White House on Tuesday denounced last week’s killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York, saying that “violence to combat any sort of corporate greed is unacceptable.” Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre offered her condolences to Thompson’s loved ones and said the federal government stands ready “to provide further support if needed” to local and state authorities investigating the killing. A 26-year-old man was arrested Monday in Pennsylvania and charged with murder in Thompson’s death. “And so, while we’re certainly not going to comment on the investigation, we condemn — we condemn violence in the strongest term,” Jean-Pierre said at Tuesday’s press briefing. “Obviously, this is horrific. Violence to combat any sort of corporate greed is unacceptable,” she added. “I’m going to let the investigation move forward, and I’m not going to speak to any manifestos or anything that is coming out to this.” Asked directly whether Americans are treated fairly by their insurance companies, Jean-Pierre demurred, saying: “I’m going to let this open investigation continue and let the law enforcement do their job.” The suspect in the death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson entered the Blair County courtroom at 1:55 p.m. ET today, shackled at the hands and feet, wearing an orange prison jumpsuit with DOC emblazoned on the back. His collar was disheveled. He was surrounded by about a half dozen uniformed officers. Once he sat down, Luigi Mangione unwrapped a piece of paper that he had with him. He sat for about 15 minutes until his attorney came in and quietly conferred with him. The judge entered at 2:20 p.m. Mangione, 26, only spoke twice, saying “I do” when sworn in and “Yes, sir” to the judge when asked if he understood his right to contest arrest. His attorney, Thomas Dickey, objected almost immediately to say the warrant of arrest, which he said he just received, didn’t mention the words “criminal homicide.” District Attorney Peter Weeks said “it does” and Judge Dave Consiglio overruled the objection. Dickey then said he was challenging extradition. Weeks ticked through what was found on Mangione when he was apprehended in Altoona, Pennsylvania, on Monday. He said it included a forged license, a gun, a silencer and ammunition, bags, multiple masks, $8,000, $2,000 in foreign currency and a passport. He also said Mangione was a transient and evaded detection for law enforcement before asking the judge to deny bail. Dickey said because the charge doesn’t carry a life sentence without parole, the judge should impose a bail. In addition, he cited the presumption of innocence and said his client had no prior criminal history. He said electric monitoring such as a bracelet could be used to track Mangione’s whereabouts if granted bail. Consiglio then ruled Mangione had 14 days to file for habeas corpus – and, if obtained, a new hearing would be scheduled. The judge gave the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania 30 days to obtain a governor’s warrant and denied bail, saying Mangione would remain at SCI Huntingdon. The court quickly adjourned and Mangione was escorted out of the room. Luigi Mangione’s defense team has 14 days to file a petition for habeas corpus, Blair County District Attorney Peter Weeks said Tuesday following Mangione’s court appearance in Pennsylvania. Mangione is currently fighting extradition to New York. “They have 14 days to file a petition for habeas corpus, and that would simply be a document challenging the commonwealth’s ability to prove that the defendant is the person that the state of New York has issued the arrest warrant for,” Weeks said. Any court hearing on that petition will have to happen have after that 14-day deadline, Weeks added. Mangione has two dockets in Blair County, Pennsylvania. One of them will go away once he is extradited since it is his fugitive from justice charge, according to Weeks. The other case relates to Mangione’s encounter with the Altoona Police Department when he was taken into custody Monday. Mangione was denied bail related to both dockets, Weeks said. “Our primary focus is to cooperate with the New York City Police Department and Manhattan District attorney’s office so this defendant can be prosecuted for his New York homicide charge,” Weeks said. The New York prosecution of the man suspected of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Manhattan last week should take priority over additional gun charges the suspect faces in Pennsylvania, a local district attorney said. “We do not intend to delay this defendant’s extradition to New York and we certainly — we’ve indicated to New York, their prosecution should take precedence, and then ours will follow,” Blair County District Attorney Peter Weeks said It comes as the suspect, Luigi Mangione, is fighting extradition to New York following a court hearing this afternoon. Mangione faces five charges in New York — one of them is for murder, according to court documents. He also faces gun charges in Pennsylvania related to the firearm police found on him when he was arrested on Monday. Peter Weeks, the district attorney in Blair County, Pennsylvania, said his office will be prepared for when a judge schedules a hearing “to do what’s necessary” to get the man suspected of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson back to New York. The suspect, Luigi Mangione, is fighting extradition after a court hearing this afternoon. New York prosecutors have charged him with murder, among other charges, according to court filings. Weeks said contesting extradition, as the suspect did, “just provides more hoops for law enforcement, prosecutors to jump through, but we’re happy to do that.” Asked if he was disappointed that the suspected shooter is fighting his return to New York, Weeks said, ”people contest extradition all the time.” This post was updated with more of Weeks’ remarks. Luigi Mangione, the suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, was denied bail during a court appearance Tuesday and is now fighting extradition to New York. A Pennsylvania court has given him 14 days to file for writ of habeas corpus, and a hearing will be scheduled if he does. Mangione will stay at Huntingdon State Correctional Institution in Pennsylvania. Prosecutors have 30 days to obtain a governor’s warrant. The case of the shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson is a “heavy case” for law enforcement and prosecutors as they work to go through a mountain of recovered evidence, one retired NYPD detective said. David Sami told CNN described it as a “multifaceted, heavy case” with a lot of documentation and evidence. He said the district attorneys office is now going to work with the police department to make sure they have “all the ducks in a row” as they sort through what has been recovered so far and make sure it is ready for trial. New York prosecutors charged Luigi Mangione with murder and four other charges related to the fake ID and firearm, court documents show. The suspect was arrested in Pennsylvania yesterday when an employee at a local McDonald’s recognized him and called police. When asked about the suspect sitting at the restaurant for so long, Sami said it could have been that the man thought he was “hiding in plain sight.” “One thing is you’re dealing with a customer service employee who really sees everybody and that’s what helped the police identify him,” Sami said. The suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson is in court for an extradition hearing in Pennsylvania. New York prosecutors charged the suspect, Luigi Mangione, with one count of murder, two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, one count of second-degree possession of a forged document and one count of third-degree criminal possession of a weapon, online court documents show. Mangione was also in court on Monday for a preliminary arraignment on gun charges after being arrested at a Pennsylvania McDonald’s. This was before he was charged in New York. Luigi Mangione, the suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson who is facing a slew of charges in Pennsylvania and New York arrived to court Tuesday, yelling. Mangione is now in court awaiting his extradition hearing. Mangione could be heard yelling, in part, “it’s completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people. It’s lived experience!” CNN is working to determine what else Mangione yelled as he was escorted inside. One trial attorney said the defense team will have to overcome many key pieces of evidence in the murder case against the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Mercedes Colwin said the fake ID that police believe Luigi Mangione used to check into the hostel on the Upper West side before the shooting, the document expressing grievances against the insurance industry and a potentially 3-D printed ghost gun — all found on the suspect when he was arrested — are “very problematic,” she said. “Of course, that will have to be lined up with ballistics experts and they will have to show some connection to all of that evidence to the shooting of Brian Thompson. But it is very difficult and something that the defense is going to have to overcome,” Colwin said. Mangione was charged with second-degree murder and four other charges, but Colwin said that could change based on how the rest of the investigation plays out and “if investigators have access to Mangione once he gets to New York.” Specifically, Michael Alcazar, a retired NYPD detective, said investigators will be going through all of the suspect’s online activity. “They’re going to comb through all his digital data, all his rantings online,” he said. “How did he identify, you know, the victim? Was he specifically targeting the victim or was he targeting anybody at that organization?” UnitedHealth Group’s market value has tumbled by about $45 billion since the fatal shooting last week of the CEO of its insurance unit. The killing of Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, unleashed a flood of negative sentiment about the insurance industry and drew scrutiny to the insurance arm itself. UnitedHealth Group, the parent company and insurance behemoth, has seen its share price drop by 8% since the closing bell on December 3, the last day of trading prior to Thompson’s shocking death in Midtown Manhattan. The stock dropped by 10% last week, its steepest weekly percentage drop since March 2020 during the onset of the pandemic. The selloff in UnitedHealth Group’s share price late last week “seems unjustified,” David Windley, an equity analyst at Jefferies, told clients in a note on Monday. He pushed back against fears of a “regulatory crackdown” on managed care organizations. “Shooting was chilling, and the social media reaction was inhumane,” Windley said. Officials in Pennsylvania received the arrest warrant from New York for Luigi Mangione, the suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, around 8:49 a.m., a criminal complaint says. A transport order also said Mangione is being transferred Tuesday from Huntingdon State Correctional Institution to the Blair County Prison in Pennsylvania for further court proceedings. He will then be transferred back to the Huntingdon. The Pennsylvania Department of Corrections have released a new mugshot of Luigi Mangione on Tuesday, the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Later today: The suspect will appear in court in Pennsylvania this afternoon for an extradition hearing. New York prosecutors charged Mangione with murder, among four other counts, online court documents show. After police found the words “deny,” “defend” and “depose” printed on shell casings near the site where UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was gunned down, merchandise bearing those words started to appear online. Soon after, those words appeared on several items on Amazon’s store, including hats, T-shirts and pint glasses as the suspect in the case garnered sympathy from social media users who expressed frustration over insurance claim denials. The phrase might be linked to a 2010 book critiquing the health insurance industry titled, “Delay Deny Defend,” a common description of the industry’s tactics. Amazon has pulled the merchandise from the website for violating the company’s rules, according to a person familiar with Amazon’s decision making. Meanwhile, “deny, defend, depose” merchandise remains on sale on eBay. Police on Monday arrested Luigi Mangione, the suspect in Thompson’s killing, after he was spotted at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, and an employee called the police. The restaurant’s page on Google and Yelp has since been flooded with negative reviews, calling workers “rats” and “snitches.” One now-deleted review on Google that was spotted by Reuters said the “location has rats in the kitchen that will make you sick and your insurance isn’t going to cover it.” A Google spokesperson said that the “reviews violate our policies and are being removed.” Also, additional protections are being added to the profile page to prevent more of these reviews. Commenters also shared a similar sentiment on Yelp. However, Yelp turned off commenting on the McDonald’s location’s page. Read more about how companies are trying to block online support for the suspect arrested in the killing of the health insurance CEO. New York prosecutors Tuesday released official charging documents in the case of Luigi Mangione, the man suspected of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last week. In the documents, Detective Yousef Demes of the Midtown North Detective Squad outlined evidence that officials say proves Mangione is the person depicted in surveillance video fatally shooting Thompson outside of a Hilton Hotel in Midtown Manhattan. The purported evidence includes: The following charges are listed in the complaint: Pennsylvania State Police shared new images of Luigi Mangione sitting inside the McDonald’s in Altoona where he was captured on Monday. One of the images, shared in a new post on social media, shows Mangione eating what appears to be a hash brown inside the establishment. New York prosecutors have a “super strong” case against Luigi Mangione, the man suspected of fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, because he was found with a gun on him, according to former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. “He carried that gun on his person,” McCabe told CNN Tuesday. “That’s basically like putting a sign in your pocket that says ‘I did it.’” Mangione was apprehended at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, on Monday, officials said. After he was taken into custody, police found “a black 3D-printed pistol” with a loaded Glock magazine and a “black silencer” that was also 3D-printed in the 26-year-old’s backpack, according to a criminal complaint. Mangione also had multiple fake IDs in his possession, according to officials. The gun and a suppressor were “both consistent with the weapon used in the murder,” New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said during a press conference Monday afternoon. “The case against him right now is really very, very simple, basic and super strong,” McCabe added. McCabe described the shooting suspect as a “meticulous person” who tried to raise as “little attention as possible.” There are “1,000 places he could have gotten rid of those IDs and that pistol as he was making his escape out of New York,” McCabe added. “Had he done so, the case against him would be very different.” An Altoona man who frequents the McDonald’s that Luigi Mangione was arrested at on Monday says he and his friends saw the suspected shooter before the arrest was made. The regular, who identified himself as Larry, told CNN he got to McDonald’s around 6 a.m. ET on Monday, but he and his friends noticed Mangione walk in somewhere around 8 a.m. ET. “It started out almost like a joke, my one friend thought he looked like the shooter,” Larry said. “He probably heard us,” He added. “That surprised me, he stayed there as long as he did.” Larry said he wasn’t paying much attention to Mangione but noticed he was sitting about 10 feet away from him, toward the back of the restaurant. “He had a mask, a hood and a backpack from what my buddy told me. He saw him better than I did, actually.” He said. Larry said he left before the arrest took place, but later went back to the McDonald’s after hearing the news. He said he spoke to some of the employees who said they recognized Mangione. “From what I was told, the worker that took his order, she said his eyes and his eyebrows, she just thought it was him,” Larry said. He noted that after ordering, Mangione sat in the back and stayed there. “I walked past him when I left,” Larry said. “It’s unbelievable,” Larry said. “I still can’t hardly believe it’s for real, ya know?” The suspect in the shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson appeared to be driven by anger against the health insurance industry and against “corporate greed” as a whole, according to an NYPD intelligence report obtained by CNN Tuesday. “He appeared to view the targeted killing of the company’s highest-ranking representative as a symbolic takedown and a direct challenge to its alleged corruption and ‘power games,’ asserting in his note he is the ‘first to face it with such brutal honesty,’” according to an assessment based on Luigi Mangione’s “manifesto” and social media. The three-page, handwritten document was found on the 26-year-old when he was taken into custody on Monday, police officials said at a news conference after the arrest. NYPD chief of detectives Joseph Kenny said the document did not include specific threats but indicated “ill will towards corporate America.” In the intelligence report, the NYPD also noted the positive online reaction to Thompson’s killing. “This rhetoric may signal an elevated threat facing executives in the near-term, with the shooting itself having the capability to inspire a variety of extremists and grievance-driven malicious actors to violence,” the report reads. The suspect in the fatal shooting has garnered sympathy and online fandom partly because of people’s problems with the health insurance industry. The majority of insured US adults had at least one issue, including denial of claims, with their health insurance in the span of a year, according to a survey released in June 2023 by KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group. The words “deny,” “defend” and “depose” were found printed on shell casings near the site where Thompson was shot. The phrase might be linked to a 2010 book critiquing the health insurance industry titled, “Delay Deny Defend,” a common description of the industry’s tactics. Those words appeared on a number of items on Amazon’s store, including hats, T-shirts and pint glasses. Amazon has pulled the merchandise from the website for violating the company’s rules, according to a person familiar with Amazon’s decision making. It’s unclear how many people bought items emblazoned with the phrase. However, “deny, defend, depose” merchandise remains on sale on eBay. Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old suspected of fatally shooting top health insurance CEO Brian Thompson last week, is waking up in a maximum-security prison Tuesday morning charged with murder. The scion of a wealthy Baltimore family who was a high school valedictorian and an Ivy League graduate, Mangione’s arrest has left many who know him in shock. Here’s what we know: Months before police identified Luigi Mangione as the man they suspect gunned down a top health insurance CEO and then seemingly vanished from Midtown Manhattan, another disappearing act worried his friends and family. The 26-year-old scion of a wealthy Baltimore family who was a high school valedictorian and an Ivy League graduate, Mangione had maintained an active social media presence for years, posting smiling photos from his travels, sharing his weightlifting routine and discussing health challenges he faced. He publicly kept track of nearly 300 books he had read or wanted to read, even posting a favorable review of the Unabomber manifesto on a book website. But then, during the summer, Mangione appeared to stop posting online, prompting worried messages from some of his friends. “Nobody has heard from you in months, and apparently your family is looking for you,” one user posted on X in October, tagging an account belonging to Mangione. “I don’t know if you are okay,” another posted. Now, as police rush to piece together Mangione’s potential motive and movements leading up to last week’s shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, those who know him are left wondering how someone with a promising life could have possibly committed such a brazen crime. “I can make zero sense of it,” said R.J. Martin, who lived with Mangione at a Hawaii co-living space a few years ago, remembering him as friendly and thoughtful. “It’s unimaginable.” A former colleague of Mangione who worked with him as a counselor at a Stanford University summer program during his college years described him as outgoing and socially charming. “I am flabbergasted,” the colleague said, asking not to be named because of the sensitivity of the news. “I never got the impression he would self-destruct.” Read more about how those who knew Mangione are reacting to the case. Suspected UnitedHealthcare CEO shooter Luigi Mangione is being held alone in a single cell at the “maximum custody level,” according to Maria Bivens, press secretary for the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections. No incidents were reported about Mangione’s first night at State Correctional Institution Huntingdon, Bivens said. The man suspected of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on a New York City sidewalk managed to evade capture for days – puzzling even law enforcement experts. Here’s a look at what police say are the suspect’s key moves, the evidence he left behind, and what experts say about his strategy: He took a bus to New York and paid cash: The suspect cleverly avoided air travel – and the intense scrutiny that comes with it, experts said. Had he taken a plane to New York, the suspect probably would have had to use a credit card, show his ID and reveal his entire face under security cameras. If he had a gun at the time, it probably would have been detected during luggage screening. Instead, the suspect took a Greyhound bus to New York, law enforcement sources told CNN. He arrived early and stayed in a hostel — again, paying cash: The suspect arrived at the Port Authority bus terminal in Manhattan on November 24 – 10 days before the killing, authorities said. He checked into a hostel on Manhattan’s Upper West Side using a fake New Jersey driver’s license, a law enforcement official told CNN. By paying with cash, the suspect was able to avoid a digital trail linked to any credit cards or online accounts. He diligently wore a mask … and then lowered it: The suspect was seen on numerous public surveillance cameras with his jacket hood over his head and a mask over his face. But a rare image of the suspect’s unmasked face was captured on surveillance video when a hostel employee flirted with him and asked him to lower his face mask, a law enforcement official told CNN. Lowering his mask to reveal his face was “one of his biggest mistakes,” retired FBI special agent Daniel Brunner said. Read more about what experts say about Mangione here. Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old who has been named the suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, was criminally cited last year by the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources for going into an area that was closed inside a state park. According to the criminal affidavit, Mangione was cited on November 12, 2023, in Honolulu for “knowingly, intentionally, or recklessly, fail to observe and abide by an officially posted sign authorized by the board or its authorized representative designating a closed area, to wit, a State Parks sign located at the Nuuanu Pali Lookout.” In court records, Mangione was found guilty and had to pay a $100 fine. Luigi Mangione has been charged with one count of murder, two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, one count of second-degree possession of a forged document, and one count of third-degree criminal possession of a weapon, online court documents show. CNN is working to identify Mangione’s legal representative. The Pennsylvania Department of Corrections released an intake photo of Luigi Mangione, the suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Mangione, a 26-year-old Ivy League graduate from Maryland, was apprehended at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania — after an employee tipped off police that he resembled photos of the suspect widely distributed by New York City police. He did not enter a plea at his first court appearance Monday evening, which took place just hours after his arrest. Police in Altoona, Pennsylvania, released this photo tonight of Luigi Mangione, the suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, in a holding cell after he was taken into custody on Monday. After a court appearance, Mangione was moved to the State Correctional Institution in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania. Luigi Mangione, the suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has arrived at the State Correctional Institution (SCI) in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, Maria Bivens, Pennsylvania Department of Corrections press secretary, told CNN Monday evening. “SCI Huntingdon is Pennsylvania’s oldest State Correctional Institution in continuous operation, opening its gates in 1889,” the state’s official website says. © 2024 Cable News Network.

                "title": "Luigi Mangione: Who is the suspect in the shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson?",
                "content": "A profile is emerging of the 26-year-old man charged with murder over last week's fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare's chief executive, Brian Thompson, in New York City. Police announced on Monday they had arrested Luigi Mangione after he was recognised at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania. The Baltimore, Maryland, native was found in possession of a so-called ghost gun, a largely untraceable firearm, and a three-page handwritten document that indicated \"motivation and mindset\", officials said. Mr Mangione was born and raised in Maryland and has ties to San Francisco, California, according to New York Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny. He has no prior arrests in New York and his last previous address was in Honolulu, Hawaii, police said. Mr Mangione is from a prominent Baltimore family, and attended a private, all-boys high school in Baltimore, called the Gilman School, according to school officials. Thomas Maronick, a defence attorney who knows several members of the family, described them to the BBC as \"one of the best known families\" in Baltimore County. The family owns a golf course and local radio station and are \"known for being some of the greatest charitable contributors\" to Italian-American causes, Mr Maronick said. Mr Mangione was named as the valedictorian of his high school, which is usually a title bestowed upon the student with the highest academic achievements in a class. In a statement, the Gilman School called the situation \"deeply distressing\". Speaking to the BBC's US partner, CBS News, another classmate described themselves anonymously as a close friend of Mr Mangione - saying the shooting suspect \"didn't have any enemies\" and was a \"valedictorian for a reason\". Mr Maronick said that \"it's just hard to believe\" that Mr Mangione could be the suspect in this case. \"You wouldn't think someone of privilege or means from a family that's known for doing so much for the community would do something like this.\" Mr Mangione went on to graduate from the University of Pennsylvania, where he received a bachelor's and master's degree in computer science, according to the school, and founded a video game development club. A friend who attended the Ivy League college at the same time as Mr Mangione described him as a \"super normal\" and \"smart person\". Mr Mangione was employed as a data engineer for TrueCar, a digital retailing website for new and used cars, according to his social media profiles. A company spokesman told the BBC he had not worked there since 2023. According to his LinkedIn profile, Mr Mangione previously worked as a programming intern for Firaxis, a video game developer. He also spent time in a co-living surfing community in Hawaii called Surfbreak. Sarah Nehemiah, who knew him then, told CBS he left due to his back injury which had worsened from surfing and hiking. The three-page, handwritten document found on him suggested a motive, according to investigators. The pages expressed \"ill will\" towards corporate America, they said. A senior law enforcement official told the New York Times it said: \"These parasites had it coming\" and \"I do apologise for any strife and trauma, but it had to be done\". Investigators say the words \"deny\", \"defend\" and \"depose\" were written on shell casings found at the scene of Mr Thompson's murder. Critics of healthcare insurers call these the \"three Ds of insurance\" - tactics used by companies to reject payment claims by patients. Friends have told US media he had surgery on his back. The background image on an X account believed to belong to Mangione shows an x-ray of a spine with hardware in it. However, it is unclear how much his own experience of the healthcare system shaped his views. A former roommate, RJ Martin, told the BBC that while Mr Mangione \"never complained\", his back pain at times \"prohibited him\" from doing \"many normal things\", such as surfing or playing volleyball. Mr Martin - who said he eventually lost contact with Mangione - said that he believed his former friend \"would have never conceived of hurting someone else\". \"There's no making sense of it,\" he added. A person matching his name and photo had an account on Goodreads, a user-generated book review site, where he read two books about back pain in 2022, one of them called Crooked: Outwitting the Back Pain Industry. He also gave four stars to a text called Industrial Society and Its Future by Theodore Kaczynski – also known as the Unabomber manifesto. Starting in 1978, Kaczynski carried out a bombing campaign that killed three people and injured dozens of others, until he was arrested in 1996. In his review, Mr Mangione acknowledged Kaczynski was a violent individual who killed innocent people but the book should not be dismissed as the manifesto of a lunatic, rather the work of an extreme political revolutionary. His social media profiles also suggest that he had fallen out of touch with family and friends in recent months. In a post on X from October, someone tagged an account believed to be Mr Mangione's and wrote: \"Hey, are you ok? Nobody has heard from you in months, and apparently your family is looking for you.\" Mr Mangione comes from a prominent family in the Baltimore area who are known for businesses including country clubs, nursing homes and a radio station according to local media. The suspect's paternal grandparents, Nicholas and Mary Mangione, were real estate developers who purchased the Turf Valley Country Club in 1978 and Hayfields Country Club in Hunt Valley in 1986. Shortly after the suspect was charged, Republican state lawmaker Nino Mangione - believed to be Mr Mangione's cousin - released a statement saying the family was \"shocked and devastated\". \"We offer our prayers to the family of Brian Thompson and we ask people to pray for all involved\", the statement read, signing off as \"The Mangione Family\". The Franklin wildfire has burned hundreds of acres in an upmarket area of the US state of California A House task force urged the Secret Service to re-focus on its primary protective mission. The president-elect referred to the 'great state' of Canada in a social media post. Police are still searching for the suspect who shot dead the UnitedHealthcare CEO in Manhattan on Wednesday. Advocacy groups call the controversial weapon \"the fastest growing gun safety problem in the US\". Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

                "content": "Manage your account A McDonald’s customer who spotted Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old man suspected of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last week, described the moment when he saw the suspect in the restaurant Monday. The man, identified only as Larry, told Fox News that he was with a group of friends in the McDonald’s in Altoona, Pa., when one of them pointed out Mangione. “One of my friends — and I thought he was kidding — when the shooter … who they made the arrest on came in, he made a comment, ‘Well, that looks like the shooter from New York.’ But the group of us thought it was more of a joke, and we were kidding about it. But then as it turned out, it was him,” Larry said, as reported by Fox News. Mangione was charged with murder in New York City. He faces five counts, including murder in the second degree, two counts of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree, one count of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree and criminal possession of a forged instrument in the second degree, an arrest warrant showed. Police said a ghost gun, silencer and writings expressing ill will toward corporate America were found on Mangione, which linked him to the crime. Mangione, a University of Pennsylvania graduate, said in a handwritten note that he acted alone. Mangione was arrested Monday on gun charges in Altoona, according to New York City police, who described him as a “person of interest” in last week’s shooting. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

                "title": "Bengals vs. Cowboys final score: Cincinnati prevails with wild finish",
                "content": "The Cincinnati Bengals have snapped their three-game skid. Cincinnati defeated the Dallas Cowboys on the road in the Week 14 edition of “Monday Night Football,” 27-20. Wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase continued his incredible run with two more touchdowns, including a 40-yard catch-and-run that ended up being the game winner. That score made it eight touchdowns for the wideout in his last four games and extended his league lead to 15 receiving touchdowns this year. Chase might not have had a chance to score that touchdown if not for a wild sequence a few plays earlier. Bengals punter Ryan Rehkow’s punt was blocked by a Cowboys defender on fourth down coming out of the two-minute warning. But the tipped ball ended up bouncing off of the arms of cornerback/special teamer Amani Oruwariye, and Cincinnati recovered the fumble just shy of midfield. NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more. Three plays later, Chase took the game-winner to the house. Here’s the full story of how the Bengals finally won a one-score game after dropping three straight entering this week: DO YOU LIKE FOOTBALL? Then you'll enjoy getting our NFL newsletter delivered to your inbox A Bart Simpson-to-Lisa Simpson touchdown play won the game for the Bengals during \"The Simpsons\" alt-cast. Cooper Rush's pass attempt to Jake Ferguson on fourth-and-7 from the Cowboys' 48-yard line and 31 seconds remaining in the game fell incomplete. The Bengals prevailed, 27-20, thanks to that wild muffed blocked punt-to-long touchdown sequence. The Cowboys' Amani Oruwariye attempted to field a blocked punt, and it turned out to be quite costly for Dallas. Oruwariye couldn't field the blocked kick cleanly and turned it over the Bengals, who immediately took advantage of their great fortune. Instead of getting the ball back with two minutes remaining, the Cowboys got burned by Bengals receiver Ja'Marr Chase for a 40-yard touchdown pass from Joe Burrow. Chase finished the game with 14 catches for 177 yards and two touchdowns. The 14 receptions ties a record for the most in a \"Monday Night Football\" game. It was a stunning turn over events at AT&T Stadium. And for Cowboys fans, Oruwariye's muff might live in infamy alongside Leon Lett's gaffe on Thanksgiving Day 1993. Cade York knocked through his second field goal attempt of the night, this one from 29 yards out, to draw the game back even. Early in the fourth quarter, DeMarvion Overshown was in on a tackle of Bengals running back Chase Brown. After the play, the Cowboys' linebacker remained on the ground and needed the help of two Cowboys trainers to walk off of the field. Overshown has been declared out with a knee injury. Overshown, a member of the 2023 NFL draft class, missed the entirety of his rookie season after tearing his ACL in a preseason game. He had played in all 12 games for the Cowboys entering Monday night's game. Former MLS first-round draft pick Brandon Aubrey nailed his second field goal attempt of the night to give the Cowboys another lead. Dallas leads, 20-17, five seconds into the fourth quarter. Dallas has the ball on Cincinnati's 29-yard line on fourth-and-10 and will attempt a field goal to begin the fourth quarter. Joe Burrow overthrew Ja'Marr Chase deep downfield, and his pass ended in the hands of the Cowboys' safety instead. Dallas will take over possession on its own 17-yard line with 6:50 to play in the third quarter. Over on \"The Simpsons\" alt-cast, it was Cowboys safety Homer Simpson who intercepted Bengals quarterback Bart Simpson on the play. The Cowboys scored on their first possession of the second half thanks to Brandin Cooks' efforts in the end zone. The receiver ripped through a defensive hold by cornerback Josh Newton, and Cooper Rush found him in the back of the end zone for the score. It's 17-17 with 10:32 left in the third quarter. The Cowboys went three-and-out on their final possession of the first half, and this \"Monday Night Football\" matchup goes to halftime with the Bengals holding a seven-point lead. Dallas will receive the second half kickoff. The Bengals drove down to the red zone before they were stopped by Dallas' defense at the 19. Cade York hit a 37-yard field goal to give Cincinnati a 17-10 lead with 30 seconds left in the second quarter. Dallas will have one last possession before it receives the second half kickoff. Did you know York is dating a Cowboys cheerleader? Chase Brown took a swing pass from Joe Burrow to the house and celebrated his score by jumping into the Salvation Army kettle behind the end zone. Though the running back was initially declared out of bounds at the 3-yard line, the call was overturned after a review. The touchdown gave Cincinnati its first lead of the game. The Bengals lead, 13-10, with 3:30 left in the first half. Over on \"The Simpsons\" alt-cast, Lisa Simpson — who displayed her athletic abilities as a hockey goalie in the episode \"Lisa on Ice\" — came into the game for the Bengals as the running back and took Joe Burrow's pass to the end zone. Dallas is unable to take full advantage of the good field position when its drive stalls at the Bengals' 17-yard line. Brandon Aubrey knocks through a 35-yard field goal to make it 10-7 Cowboys with 6:23 left in the second quarter. The Bengals opted to go for it facing a fourth-and-3 in Dallas territory. DeMarvion Overshown managed to break forward to defend Joe Burrow's touch pass attempt to running back Chase Brown, which fell to the ground incomplete. The Cowboys will take over near midfield with just under 10 minutes to go in the first half. On the first play of the second quarter, Cooper Rush's pass attempt was tipped by cornerback Cam Taylor-Britt and intercepted by Geno Stone inside the Bengals' 5-yard line. Cincinnati takes over on its own 4 five seconds into the period. Dallas and Cincinnati are knotted at one score apiece after 15 minutes, but the Cowboys will have second-and-10 from the Bengals' 12-yard line to start the second quarter. After CeeDee Lamb caught a screen pass behind the line of scrimmage, Bengals linebacker Germaine Pratt got his hands on the receiver almost immediately. The veteran wideout was able to escape the tackle and ran across the width of the field before turning upfield for a massive gain. The play brought the Cowboys from their own 33-yard line to just outside of the red zone with less than two minutes left in the first quarter. Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow marched his team down the field on an 11-play, 70-yard drive that concluded with Ja'Marr Chase hauling in a contested catch in the end zone. It's the wideout's seventh touchdown in his last four games. This game is tied, 7-7, with 2:45 remaining in the first quarter. Over on \"The Simpsons\" alt-cast, Bart Simpson enters the game to play quarterback for the Bengals and throws a touchdown pass to Ralph Wiggum, who somehow got position for the reception against the Cowboys' Pro Bowl cornerback DaRon Bland. Bart Simpson has shown significant improvement at the position ever since his infamous tenure as a quarterback in the episode \"Bart Star.\" After a three-and-out by the Bengals' offense, Cowboys quarterback Cooper Rush led a nine-play, 60-yard touchdown drive to open the scoring. Rush found Lamb in the back-right corner of the end zone on a fourth-and-1 play from the Cincinnati 11-yard line. Over on \"The Simpsons\" alt-cast, quarterback Homer Simpson came in to connect with Lamb for the touchdown play. The Bengals head south to AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, to take on the Cowboys in prime time on Monday night.

Welcome to 2024 and this battle of the streaming wars, as Disney and ESPN unveil its most alternative alt-cast for \"Monday Night Football\" as the Cowboys host the Bengals. “We were just so lucky also that the Cowboys are sort of like a Homer Simpson-type team, American team, and Mike McCarthy might be a Homer-type guy, one might imagine,” “The Simpsons” showrunner Matt Selman said on a conference call last week. “And then you have Joe Burrow on the other side who is a cool young, spiky-haired, blonde bad boy – he's like Bart. And that fits our character archetypes so perfectly.” — Chris Bumbaca Here's how the USA TODAY Sports staff feels the Cowboys vs. Bengals \"MNF\" matchup will sway: The Bengals are favorites to defeat the Cowboys, according to the BetMGM NFL odds.

Dak Prescott suffered a partial hamstring avulsion – a tear during which part of the tendon rips off the bone – during Dallas' 27-21 loss to the Falcons in Week 9. He told reporters after the contest that he wasn't sure if the injury occurred while he was running or being tackled. \"It's something I’ve never felt,\" Prescott said while describing the injury. \"I saw the medical team and asked could I make it worse. At that point they said I wouldn’t be able to protect myself and made the call to hold me out.\" According to BetMGM Sportsbook, the Cowboys have +3000 odds to to make the playoffs entering Week 14. That implied probability gives Dallas a 3.23% chance of qualifying for the postseason. That's greater than the estimated 1% chance that the New York Times gives the Cowboys to win their way into the postseason. That speaks to the fact that Dallas would likely need to win out and receive plenty of help to claw its way back into the NFC playoff race after a 3-7 start to the season. The Cowboys' five remaining opponents have a combined winning percentage of .508, per Tankathon. That makes Dallas' remaining schedule the 17th toughest of the NFL's 32 teams entering Week 14. The said, the Cowboys will face a test on \"Monday Night Football\" in Week 14 against a high-flying Cincinnati Bengals offense. Dallas will also end the season with two divisional games, so that will make it difficult to win out. That makes it easy to understand why oddsmakers aren't bullish the Cowboys' chances of making a playoff push, especially considering that they would need a team in front of them, like the Commanders, to falter. Below is a full look at Dallas' schedule: In the hunt: x – clinched playoff berth Should the Cowboys opt to move on from Mike McCarthy following the 2024 season, there are several options who could be targeted as next Dallas head coach: The Bengals travel to Jerry World on Monday night. The Week 14 “MNF” matchup will kick off at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. AT&T Stadium has hosted one Super Bowl — Super Bowl XLV between the Green Bay Packers and Pittsburgh Steelers. It also was the host site for the 2018 NFL draft. The stadium also hosted the first College Football Playoff national championship game in 2015, which was won by the Ohio State Buckeyes against the Oregon Ducks. ➤ Ranking NFL's stadiums from 1 to 30: Where does Cowboys' AT&T Stadium rate? The roof is closed at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, so weather will not be a factor in Monday night’s game. The New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers are tied for the most Super Bowl wins with six. The Dallas Cowboys are tied with the San Francisco 49ers for the second-most Super Bowls titles with five. While the Cowboys have made eight Super Bowl appearances (tied for the second-most with the 49ers and Steelers), the team hasn't played for the NFL title since the 1995 season when it won Super Bowl XXX. The Cincinnati Bengals have made three Super Bowl appearances, the most recent being during the 2021 season when they lost to the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl 56.

The reasons for such a distinction didn't have much to do with the game's postseason implications — Cincinnati's playoff hopes are on their last legs, while Dallas' have already evaporated. Rather, this was a spectacle, just the sort that Jerry Jones envisioned when drawing up the plans for AT&T Stadium, the booming metropolis he hoped would house championship-caliber teams. So, how is that plan going along thus far? Well, on Monday, the Cowboys added a new low to a season increasingly filled with them, falling to the Bengals 27-20 under the MNF banner. MORE BENGALS-COWBOYS NEWS: A defeat to Cincinnati and its talismanic battery of Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase wouldn't be a cause of much concern in normal circumstances. The pairing was as lively as ever on Monday, with Burrow completing 75 percent of his pass attempts and accounting for 369 yards and three touchdowns worth of passing offense. Chase collected 14 catches for 177 yards and two scores on the night, further cementing his place as a legitimate Offensive Player of the Year contender. For all of Burrow and Chase's heroics, it was Dallas that looked the likelier victors with two minutes left. Nick Vigil burst through the mire, got his harrowing mitts to Ryan Rehkow's attempted punt, and batted it down to a mere trickle off Rehkow's foot. The ball sidled back and forth like a tumbleweed as it bounded harmlessly toward midfield, seemingly foreshadowing some sort of Cowboys win. Right? Not exactly. Gunner Amani Oruwariye attempted to field the bouncing ball, only to mishandle the wild feather. It bounced into Cincinnati's hands afterward. League rules insist that in such a circumstance, the kicking team receives the ball with a full set of downs. Burrow and Chase went to work, chopped down Dallas' secondary in one fell swoop, and walked out fortunate victors. The Cowboys, meanwhile, were left rueing another seemingly incomprehensible defeat.

The Bengals will take control with about 5:40 left in the fourth. 10:48 p.m.: Cincinnati is forced to boot the ball away.

                "content": "ARLINGTON, Texas -- Bengals wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase re-gained the NFL receiving lead with a season-high 14 catches, the last one a spectacular 40-yard-catch-and-run touchdown with 1:01 left that gave the Bengals a 27-20 win over the Cowboys Monday night. Former Bengals linebacker Nick Vigil blocked rookie punter Ryan Rehkow's punt on the first play after two-minute warning, but a Cowboy touched it, and Bengals rookie linebacker Maema Njongmeta recovered to give Cincinnati a new set of downs. Quarterback Joe Burrow had his fifth straight game of at least three touchdown passes and his fourth straight 300-yard day with 369 yards, 177 to Chase. Ja’Marr Chase caught a swing pass from Joe Burrow on the game's first play from scrimmage, marking his 80th reception of the season. He became the first player in NFL history to record 80+ catches, 1,000+ receiving yards and 7+ receiving touchdowns in each of his first four career seasons. On his game-winning touchdown catch late in the fourth period, Chase surpassed 5,000 career receiving yards. Playing in his 58th regular-season game, he tied former Saints receiver Michael Thomas as the fifth-fastest player in league history to reach 5K receiving yards. Chase's final tally was 14 receptions for 177 yards and two scores. His 14 grabs were the second-most in his career, and tied for the second-most in any game in Bengals history. Burrow Joins Elite Company Burrow completed 33 of 44 passes for 369 yards and three touchdowns with an interception, good for a passer rating of 112.8. He became the sixth quarterback all-time to throw for 300+ yards and 3+ touchdowns in four consecutive games. The record for most such consecutive games belongs to Steve Young, who hit those numbers in five straight contests in 1998. Drew Brees (2011-12), Peyton Manning (2012), Aaron Rodgers (2012-13) and Patrick Mahomes (2018) are the other quarterbacks who did it in four straight. Burrow found Chase in the end zone on a second-and-goal play to give Cincinnati its first points of the game with 2:45 left in the first quarter. It was Chase's 14th receiving touchdown of the season, which extended his league-leading total and set a new career high. His previous career high of 13 touchdowns came in his 2021 rookie campaign. Chase's 14 receiving scores also stand alone as the second-most in a season in Bengals history, three shy of Carl Pickens' record 17 touchdowns in 1995. The touchdown additionally was the 43rd of Chase's career, which surpassed former Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski (42) for the fourth-most within a player's first four seasons in NFL history. Only Hall of Famers Randy Moss (53), Randy Moss (49) and Bob Hayes (45) caught more touchdowns in their first four years. Chase eclipsed 100 yards on the night with his ninth catch early in the third quarter. It marked his 18th career game with 100+ receiving yards (fourth this season), which tied former receiver Cris Collinsworth for the fifth-most in Bengals history. Chase finished the night with 14 catches for 177 yards and two touchdowns. Second-year halfback Chase Brown finished the night with 58 rushing yards on 14 attempts and 65 receiving yards on six catches, good for 123 total yards from scrimmage. It marked his fifth game this season with over 100 scrimmage yards. In the process, he also surpassed 1,000 scrimmage yards on the year, moving up to 1,037. Vote for The 2025 Pro Bowl Games! Send your favorite Bengals to Orlando for the 2025 Pro Bowl Games! Brown took a Burrow swing pass and raced 19 yards to the pylon to give Cincinnati a 14-10 lead late in the second quarter. It was Brown's third scoring reception of the season, and his 10th career touchdown overall (six rushing, four receiving). Brown now has nine touchdowns over his last 10 games played, dating back to Week 4 at Carolina. Geno Stone came up with his second interception of the season midway through the second quarter, when he secured a pass that was deflected by Cam Taylor-Britt to end a Cowboys drive that reached Cincinnati's 12-yard line. It also was the 10th pick of Stone's career. Check out the best photos from Cowboys-Bengals Week 14 matchup. The Bengals line up for the snap against the Cowboys in Dallas, Monday, December 9, 2024.

                "title": "Daniel Penny found not guilty in chokehold death of Jordan Neely",
                "content": "Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Daniel Penny was acquitted Monday of criminally negligent homicide in the chokehold death of Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old homeless man with a history of mental illness whose final moments on a New York City subway train were captured on bystander video that set off weeks of protests and drew national attention. The decision, on the fifth day of deliberations, came after the jury deadlocked Friday on the more serious charge of manslaughter, leading the judge to dismiss it. Penny faced up to four years in prison. As the jury foreperson read the “not guilty” verdict, some observers in the courtroom applauded. Others began to audibly sob and yell, including Neely’s father, Andre Zachery, who was escorted out. “This is America. That is the sound of Black pain,” one person said outside of the courtroom in Lower Manhattan to the reaction. Chants of “no justice, no peace,” could be heard echoing from outside. The case divided people in New York — and beyond — in some cases along political and racial lines. Neely was Black. Penny is white. Some people viewed Penny as callous and his actions as criminal on the day he encountered Neely, who had been shouting and acting erratically when he boarded a subway train in Manhattan on May 1, 2023. Others contend Penny was selfless in his attempt to protect fellow passengers. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said he respected the jury's verdict. The jury deliberated for about an hour on the criminally negligent homicide charge after about four days spent considering the manslaughter charge. “Their lengthy deliberation — and the totality of the facts and the evidence — underscored why this case was put in front of a jury of Mr. Penny's peers,” Bragg said in a statement. The anonymous jury, made up of seven women and five men, were told before they began deliberating that they had to come to a unanimous decision on the top charge of manslaughter in the second degree before moving on to consider criminally negligent homicide. But Judge Maxwell Wiley changed that order Friday after jurors twice sent a note saying they could not reach an agreement. The judge had also instructed jurors to decide whether Penny’s actions caused Neely’s death and, if so, whether he had acted recklessly and in an unjustified manner. Before he encountered Penny, Neely, a former Michael Jackson impersonator, ranted about being hungry and thirsty and said that he wanted to return to jail and didn’t care if he lived or died, witnesses testified. Penny, 26, a former Marine and Long Island native, placed Neely in a chokehold that prosecutors said lasted almost six minutes. A New York City medical examiner ruled that Neely died from compression to his neck as a result of the chokehold. Neely’s uncle, Christopher Neely, said he was “taken aback” as the verdict was announced because he thought the jury would at least convict him on the lesser charge. “At least give him a charge because it should be some type of penalty that should have been been handed down to Danny Penny period. They gave him no penalty, and I feel like the jury gave up on us,” Neely said. Donte Mills, a lawyer representing Neely's family, said at a news conference that he was disheartened by the verdict Monday, as supporters held up a picture of Neely dressed as Jackson. Mills asked that Neely's death have meaning, and urged that others, instead of becoming physical with someone who may be hungry, offer them food. “He had a muffin in his pocket,” Mills said of what police later discovered in Neely's jacket. “Jordan just wanted someone to acknowledge him on the train, but instead, he was choked to death.” Lawyers for Penny could not immediately be reached for comment about the verdict, but had earlier expressed concern Monday to the judge that the jury could be influenced by the demonstrators' chanting coming from outside the courthouse. During the trial, Penny’s attorneys told jurors that he stepped in because he believed Neely might attack other passengers and he intended only to restrain him until police arrived, which Penny also told police. They also argued that Neely was not killed by the chokehold and that it was impossible to measure how much pressure Penny had applied. A forensic pathologist hired by the defense testified that Neely died from a combination of his schizophrenia, synthetic marijuana, sickle cell trait and the struggle from being in Penny’s restraint. But the medical examiner who performed the autopsy on Neely, Dr. Cynthia Harris, told jurors it was her medical opinion “that there are no alternative reasonable explanations” for his death and that those proposed by the defense were “so improbable — that it stands shoulder to shoulder with impossibility.” During cross-examination, one of Penny’s attorneys, Steven Raiser sought to cast doubt on Harris’ testimony about how she and her colleagues had come to a unanimous decision as to Neely’s cause of death. Raiser suggested that they had failed to consider all the facts before making that determination. He revisited that claim in his closing argument last week. “I submit to you there was a rush to judgment, based on something other than medical science,” he told jurors. The case also spurred debates about safety within the city’s subway system and failures in addressing homelessness and mental illness, both of which Neely had struggled with. Jumaane Williams, a Black Democrat who is New York City’s public advocate, was among those who questioned why police let Penny go after questioning him at a precinct hours after Neely’s killing. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, also a Democrat, said Neely had been “murdered.” Prominent Republicans like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Matt Gaetz praised Penny and promoted a fundraiser for his legal fund, which has raised more than $3 million. His defense team includes Thomas Kenniff, a Republican who ran unsuccessfully for Manhattan District Attorney in 2021. Vice President-elect JD Vance said on X in response to the verdict that “justice was done in this case. It was a scandal Penny was ever prosecuted in the first place.” Prosecutors did not dispute that Neely’s actions on the train scared many of the passengers or that he was on synthetic cannabinoids, which were found in his system. In her opening statement, Dafna Yoran, an assistant prosecutor with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, said that Neely had “demanded to be seen” and that despite his not having touched anyone and not having displayed a weapon or threatened to use one, many people in the subway car were frightened of what he might do. She has said Penny’s “initial intent was even laudable,” but that he was reckless when he continued to choke Neely even after he posed no threat, including after the train doors had opened at the next station and passengers could exit. For some of that time, she said and video showed, two other men helped restrain Neely. One of those men testified that he believed Penny had held the chokehold for too long. At times, Yoran said, he even ignored the pleas of bystanders to let Neely go. In her closing argument, Yoran said that “no one had to die” and that Penny was not justified in his use of physical deadly force. “You obviously cannot kill someone because they are crazy and ranting and looking menacing,” Yoran told jurors in her closing argument. “No matter what it is that they are saying.” She also said that Penny “could have easily restrained” Neely “without choking him to death.” In his closing argument, Raiser prompted jurors to imagine that they were on the train the day Neely boarded “filled with rage and not afraid of any consequences.” “With you sitting much as you are now in this tightly confined space, looking up at Mr. Neely,” he said. “You have very little room to move and nowhere to run.” “Danny,” as the defense attorneys referred to Penny throughout the trial, “put his life on the line” and stepped up in the absence of police, Raiser said. But Yoran challenged the portrayal of Penny as a self-sacrificing and benevolent subway rider. In her opening statement she said that Penny failed to acknowledge Neely’s humanity. She continued that thread in her closing argument, playing video of Penny twice referring to Neely as a “crackhead” in an interview with police and telling jurors that he never asked about Neely’s condition. “There is something else that is glaringly missing from his statement. Any regret. Any remorse. Any self reflection,” she said. She added: “He never expresses any sorrow about the man’s death.” During deliberations, jurors asked to rewatch bystander videos of Penny restraining Neely, responding officers’ body camera videos and video of Penny’s subsequent interview with two police detectives at a precinct. They also asked to rehear the medical examiner’s testimony about issuing a death certificate before Neely’s full toxicology reports were completed. They also asked for the judge to read back the definitions of recklessness and criminal negligence and to have the definitions in writing. Penny chose not to testify. During the trial, jurors heard from more than 40 witnesses — subway passengers who witnessed Penny restrain Neely, police officers who responded to the scene, a Marine Corps instructor who taught Penny various chokeholds, the two pathologists, a psychiatric expert and six character witnesses, who included two Marines, Penny’s mother and one of his sisters. On Wednesday, Neely’s father sued Penny accusing him of negligent contact, assault and battery that caused Neely’s death. The civil suit was filed in New York state’s Supreme Court, a trial-level court in New York state. Janelle Griffith is a national reporter for NBC News focusing on issues of race and policing.

                "content": "Watch CBS News By Alice Gainer, Dick Brennan, Tim McNicholas Updated on: December 10, 2024 / 8:17 AM EST / CBS New York NEW YORK -- Daniel Penny was found not guilty of criminally negligent homicide in the chokehold death of Jordan Neely on a New York City subway car in 2023. Penny, a 26-year-old Marine veteran, had pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. The judge dismissed the manslaughter charge on Friday after jurors said they could not come to a unanimous decision. The jury could only consider the negligent homicide charge if Penny was cleared of manslaughter. Word of the verdict came after jurors deliberated for more than 20 hours. Penny appeared to smile, as his attorneys hugged each other. \"We couldn't be more pleased that a jury of Danny's peers acquitted him of any wrongdoing. And now New Yorkers can take some comfort in knowing that we can continue to stand up for one another without sacrificing our rights or our freedoms,\" his lawyers said in a statement. His attorneys later shared a photo on social media showing them raise a glass at a bar after the verdict. CBS News New York's Alice Gainer was inside the courtroom when the decision came down. She reported it was chaos, as some cheered in support of Penny, and Neely's father, Andre Zachery, had to leave the room because he stood up and was heard swearing. Zachery told CBS News New York, \"My son didn't have to go through this. I didn't have to go through this, either. It hurts. It really, really hurts,\" adding, \"What's going to happen to us now? Had enough of this. System is rigged. Come on, people. Let's do something about this.\" Penny faced a maximum possible sentence of 15 years in prison on the manslaughter charge, or four years on the negligent homicide charge. There was no minimum sentence. Protesters lined up outside the courthouse Monday, chanting \"Justice for Jordan Neely!\" Inside, Penny's defense team asked for a mistrial and once again was denied. The defense also raised concerns that jurors could potentially hear some of what the demonstrators were saying. They said the demonstrators were using megaphones and bullhorns, chanting things like, \"Murdered!\" and \"Subway strangler!\" The judge agreed he also heard the commotion and reminded the jury to ignore things they may hear or read about the case. One activist who had been outside demonstrating every morning was inside and yelled something at Penny along the lines of \"It's a small world, buddy.\" \"Our call to action is to take care of each other. We can't rely on outside people. If we see someone asking for food, we have to take the responsibility to give it to them. If we see someone cold, to give them a coat. If we see someone going through something, to ask them if they're OK,\" Donte Mills, attorney for the Neely family, said during a news conference outside the courthouse. \"That's how we help each other, because we can't rely on the system to do it for us.\" Eric Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, also spoke outside the courthouse, saying, \"No one deserves to be choked to death,\" adding, \"I tell this family, do not give up, because that's what they want you to do. They want to discourage you, just like they tried to discourage me. Ten years later, I'm still fighting.\" The Rev. Al Sharpton, who spoke at Neely's funeral, put out a statement, which read, in part, \"This verdict represents the blatant legalization of civilian vigilantism, sending a dangerous message that citizens can now take matters into their own hands, even if it leads to someone's death.\" \"It was foolish of us to think that a Black man would get justice in a system that is designed to keep him oppressed,\" added Chivona Newsome, co-founder of Black Lives Matter Greater New York. The verdict drew praise from Vice President-elect JD Vance and New York Congressman Mike Lawler, who both criticized Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg for prosecuting Penny. Bragg released a statement following the verdict, saying: \"As with every case, we followed the facts and the evidence from beginning to end. A Grand Jury voted to indict, and the Office carefully presented this case to a trial jury. \"Over the course of the trial, we introduced medical records, videos, bodycam footage, and testimony from over 30 witnesses, including from the City's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. \"The jury carefully deliberated for four days. They requested readbacks of testimony and asked for video footage to re-watch, as well as written definitions of the law. Their lengthy deliberation - and the totality of the facts and the evidence -- underscored why this case was put in front of a jury of Mr. Penny's peers. \"The jury has now spoken. At the Manhattan D.A.'s Office we deeply respect the jury process and we respect their verdict. \"Unfortunately, over the duration of this trial, talented career prosecutors and their family members were besieged with hate and threats -- on social media, by phone and over email. Simply put, this is unacceptable, and everyone, no matter your opinion on this case, should condemn it. These are prosecutors who have dedicated decades of their lives to public service and to the safety of Manhattan. I am grateful to them, as well as to the NYPD for their hard work and commitment on not only this matter, but for all they do on behalf of New Yorkers. I also want to thank Judge Wiley for presiding over this case. Finally, I want to thank the members of the jury who took time out of their lives to diligently evaluate the evidence.\" Mayor Eric Adams was asked by reporters if he thinks the verdict says anything about the mood of the city, and if he feels like it could open the door for more of these interactions of people exacting their own justice. \"Good question. And I'll answer the latter first. Of what you see, of what people often do, a lot of people make interpretations, you know, about trials, but juries are in the courtroom. They're hearing every piece of evidence, they are hearing the testimonies. They have to make the decision. And that's the system that we have,\" he replied. \"And actually, it is probably one of the best systems on the globe. And I think the jury's heard the evidence and made a determination based on the evidence that they heard. And the ... does it impact what's going to happen throughout the city that people are not going to take action or going to take action? I don't think it does. \"I think that oftentimes people make these decisions when they are in the midst of it. And there's a desire of New Yorkers to help out those who are in need. There's a desire of New Yorkers is to always respond when they believe it's necessary. And I don't think that is going to change in any way. This is not the first time, and I'm sure it's not going to be the last time that individuals take actions and people are going to question about those actions that happened. \"But at the cornerstone and at the heart of this is that, of this young man, like so many others that are on our subway systems, I made it clear that's not a place to sleep, to live. That's not a place to be. And when they need help, we need to give them the help of that they have.\" In order to be convicted of manslaughter, prosecutors had to prove: In order to be convicted of criminally negligent homicide, prosecutors had to prove: Police and witnesses said Neely, 30, boarded an F train in SoHo on May 1, 2023 and began shouting, throwing things and making threats. Penny, a passenger on the train, approached Neely from behind and tried to restrain him. Video shows Penny holding Neely in a chokehold on the floor of the train for several minutes until Neely stopped moving. After police arrived, officers administered Narcan to Neely, performed CPR and used an AED, but were unable to revive him. Neely was pronounced dead at the scene. Police said Neely did not have any weapons on him. A medical examiner ruled Neely's death a homicide three days later, with the cause as compression of the neck. Toxicology reports showed Neely had synthetic marijuana in his system when he died. Neely was a street performer and Michael Jackson impersonator who was experiencing homelessness and had struggled with mental illness after his mother was murdered in 2007. Video of Penny holding Neely in the chokehold was widely circulated online. Neely's death sparked protests across New York City, with many raising concerns about the need for better mental health care in the city, and Neely's family called for Penny's arrest. Penny turned himself in on May 12, 2023, and was initially charged with second-degree manslaughter and released on $100,000 bail. He was arraigned in June and pleaded not guilty to criminally negligent homicide and second-degree manslaughter. Penny defended his actions, saying he was trying to protect other passengers on the train by restraining Neely. In late October 2024, a 12-person jury and four alternates were selected and sworn in. They included seven women and five men, with at least seven White people, one Hispanic person, one Filipino person, one Black person and one person of Middle Eastern descent. The trial began Nov. 1. The prosecution argued in their opening statements that Penny, though he had good intentions, recklessly used excessive force without trying any other means of deescalating the situation. The defense, meanwhile, argued Penny was protecting other passengers and there was no other way to deescalate due to Neely's behavior. Jurors heard testimony from multiple witnesses, including police officers, MTA employees, passengers on the train and a bystander who helped Penny restrain Neely. Penny's Marine Corps martial arts instructor and the medical examiner who performed Neely's autopsy also took the stand. The defense called Penny's mother and platoon sergeants as character witnesses, along with a forensic pathologist who said he disagreed with the medical examiner's cause of death. Jurors began their deliberations last Tuesday. They sent two notes back to the judge. The first requested a readback of part of the judge's instructions. The second note asked the judge if they could return for deliberations Wednesday, which is a day they would normally have had off. The judge approved that request. Wednesday morning, jurors sent another note, asking to see a video compilation of police bodycams from the incident, as well as footage of Penny's police station interview. Jurors also asked for readback of the medical examiner's cross-examination. Friday morning, on the fourth day of deliberations, they sent a note to the judge indicating they couldn't reach a unanimous verdict on his manslaughter charge.

                "title": "Daniel Penny found not guilty in Jordan Neely's death",
                "content": "Marine veteran Daniel Penny was acquitted by a Manhattan jury Monday in the chokehold death of Jordan Neely — a lightning-rod case that cast a light on the mayhem plaguing Big Apple subways. Jurors cleared Penny, a 26-year-old Long Islander, of criminally negligent homicide after the caught-on-camera fatal encounter on an uptown F train last year sparked fierce debate about mental illness, public safety and vigilantism. A suited-up Penny, who remained stone-faced for much of the four-week trial, broke out a huge smile as his not guilty verdict was read out — prompting both applause and anger inside the courtroom as the high-profile case came to an end. Penny “finally got the justice he deserved,” one of his lawyers, Thomas Kenniff, said while celebrating with him at a bar in downtown Manhattan just hours after the verdict. “I’m not surprised in the sense that Day 1 we knew that we believed he would be exonerated because the evidence overwhelmingly supported that.” The verdict, which followed more than 20 hours of jury deliberations, came after the more serious manslaughter charge was dismissed by prosecutors last week after the 12 jurors — seven women and five men — deadlocked on that rap. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg — who quickly faced calls to resign for bringing the case against Penny in the first place — said he respected the jury’s ruling and insisted that prosecutors “followed the facts and the evidence from beginning to end.” “It really, really hurts,” Neely’s father, Andre Zachary, said after the verdict. “I had enough of this. The system is rigged.” Follow The Post’s live blog for the latest updates on Daniel Penny’s not guilty verdict Over the course of the four-week trial, defense attorneys painted Penny as a hero who was “fully justified” when he took down Neely — a 30-year-old, troubled homeless man who witnesses said was menacing others and making threats — on an uptown F train on May 1, 2023. They questioned, too, whether there was sufficient evidence that the chokehold caused Neely’s death — arguing he died from a mix of schizophrenia, drug use, a genetic condition and the struggle with the Marine vet. Prosecutors tried to convince jurors that Penny was “criminally reckless” and went “way too far” while holding Neely in the chokehold for roughly six minutes — even after he appeared to stop moving on his own. After watching footage of the fatal encounter more than a dozen times and hearing testimony from 40 witnesses, including terrified straphangers, jurors ultimately found there wasn’t proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Penny wasn’t justified in his actions. Penny could have faced up to four years behind bars if convicted of the lesser charge, and up to 15 on second-degree manslaughter. “I think the jurors all put themselves in that subway car, heard the fear of the passengers and identified with it — and rejected the criminalization of the actions Mr. Penny took in the face of clear danger,” Thomas J. Curran, a former assistant DA in Manhattan, told The Post. “This entire incident was a tragedy all around. The social infrastructure our city maintains to support and aid troubled persons like Jordan Neely clearly failed him. Mr. Penny will forever have the tragic death of Mr. Neely as part of him and his life. But the tragedy that was the death of Mr. Neely does not mean that a crime occurred. Trying to make it a crime was a mistake from the start.” Arthur Aidala, a former Brooklyn prosecutor-turned-criminal lawyer, speculated that the verdict boiled down to the term “reasonableness.” “Was it reasonable for Penny to act the way he did to have the fear that he did, for himself or a third party, regarding self-defense,” Aidala said. “And I guess once they took manslaughter in the second degree off the table, they pretty swiftly reached a verdict regarding criminally negligent homicide.” News of the verdict, meanwhile, sparked an immediate reaction across the Big Apple — and the rest of the country — as some lawmakers claimed the DA’s office politicized the case and tried to turn Penny into a villain as crime spirals on the streets and underground. “There are people in the [DA’s] office who are quietly relieved that he was found not guilty,” a source inside Bragg’s office told The Post. “You can’t say they are happy because someone did die, but they don’t think he was tried because he committed a crime, but rather because of politics, which should never happen.” Others, including Mayor Eric Adams, argued that the case highlighted a broken system that failed Neely and others suffering from mental health issues or drug dependency. “Jordan should not have had to die, and, I strongly believe as I’ve stated from day one, that we have a mental health system that is broken,” Hizzoner said when asked if the verdict was a reflection of New Yorkers being fed up with the system. “New Yorkers have always been tired of things that allow people who commit violent acts to be part of a revolving-door system,” he said.
