                "content": "Manage your account UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was fatally shot Wednesday outside a Midtown Manhattan Hilton. On Monday, police arrested \"person of interest\" Luigi Mangione in Altoona, Pa., on gun charges. The killing of the 50-year-old father of two had sparked a manhunt in New York City and beyond. Police in Pennsylvania on Monday arrested the \"person of interest\" in the Midtown Manhattan shooting death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. New York Police Department officials said at a press conference that 26-year-old Luigi Mangione was arrested 280 miles away in Altoona, Pennsylvania, on firearms charges. He has not been charged for the killing of Thompson, which police have described as a \"brazen, targeted attack.\" Mangione was arraigned in Pennsylvania on Monday evening. He was charged with two felonies — forgery and carrying a firearm without a license — and three misdemeanors — tampering with records or identification, possessing instruments of crime, and false identification to law enforcement — according to a criminal complaint viewed by Business Insider. He was ordered held without bail. Mangione was eating in a local McDonald's when an employee recognized him from the several surveillance images that authorities released and called the police, police said. Altoona police found Mangione with multiple fake IDs, a US passport as well as a firearm and a suppressor \"both consistent with the weapon used\" in the December 4 killing of Thompson in the heart of Manhattan, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. The gun appears to be \"ghost gun\" that may have been made on a 3-D printer with the capability of firing a 9-millimeter round, NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said earlier on Monday. The criminal complaint said the gun and the silencer had been 3-D-printed. Clothing, including a mask, was also recovered \"consistent with those worn\" by the suspect wanted for Thompson's killing, along with a fake New Jersey ID matching the ID that the murder suspect used to check into a Manhattan hostel before the attack, Tisch said. Additionally, Altoona police found a three-page handwritten document \"that speaks to both his motivation and mindset,\" said Tisch. Based on the document, according to Kenny, \"it does seem that he has some ill will toward corporate America.\" \"Our investigation is leaning toward he was acting alone,\" Kenny said. Investigators with the NYPD were traveling to Altoona on Monday to interview Mangione, Tisch said. Mangione is expected to be extradited to New York to face other charges, Kenny added. Blair County District Attorney Peter Weeks said at Mangione's Pennsylvania arraignment that Mangione was carrying $10,000 in cash, including foreign currency, according to the Associated Press. Mangione disputed the amount. On X, Mangione posted and amplified posts about technological advances like artificial intelligence. He also posted about fitness and healthy living. He frequently retweeted posts by the writer Tim Urban and commentator Jonathan Haidt about the promise and perils of technology. He also appeared to be a fan of Michael Pollan, known for his writing about food and ethics, and lab-grown meat. At the top of his profile was a header image with three images: a photo of himself, smiling, shirtless on a mountain ridge, a Pokemon, and an x-ray with four pins or screws visible in the lower back. Mangione founded a company called AppRoar Studios in 2015 while still in high school. AppRoar released an iPhone game called Pivot Plane that is no longer available. The two other cofounders of AppRoar could not be reached for comment. Mangione's X account has been deactivated. A spokesperson for YouTube said his three accounts on the platform were also terminated, but that they had not been active for about seven months. The arrest follows a nearly week-long manhunt for a masked, slightly-built gunman who police say ambushed the 50-year-old father of two from Minnesota early Wednesday morning outside of the New York Hilton Midtown hotel. According to police, Manigone was born and raised in Maryland, and has ties to San Francisco, California. Manigone's last known address was in Honolulu, Hawaii. Kenny said that Manigone has no prior arrest history in New York and no known arrests in the US. A Luigi Mangione with a matching birthday and address received a citation for simple trespass for entering a forbidden area of a state park in Hawaii in November 2023. He pled no contest and paid a $100 fine. In the past week, police have circulated more than a half-dozen images of a suspect, including images that Tisch previously described in an interview with CNN as the \"money shot\" showing the suspect's face unmasked. \"For just over five days, our NYPD investigators combed through thousands of hours of video, followed up on hundreds of tips, and processed every bit of forensic evidence — DNA, fingerprints, IP addresses and so much to tighten the net,\" Tisch said at Monday's press conference announcing the arrest of Manigone. Thompson was shot multiple times on a 6th Avenue sidewalk as he was walking toward the Hilton hotel. He was steps away from a side entrance to the hotel — where he was set to speak at UnitedHealth Group's investor conference — when a hooded gunman opened fire on him from behind. The chief executive of the nation's largest health insurer was struck at least once in the back and at least once in the right calf, police said. Surveillance footage showed the gunman firing his weapon as Thompson, wearing a blue suit jacket, walked several feet in front of him. A law-enforcement source, who was not authorized to speak to the press, previously told Business Insider that the gun appeared to be equipped with a silencer and that the gunman \"definitely knew\" where Thompson was going to be. The gunman fled the scene, first on foot and then on an electric bike, which he rode into Central Park before ultimately escaping from New York City, authorities said. Shell casings and bullets found at the scene had the words \"deny,\" \"defend,\" and \"depose\" written on them, according to multiple reports citing unnamed sources. BI couldn't independently confirm these details. In the aftermath of the attack, the NYPD offered a $10,000 reward for tips leading to the gunman's arrest, with the FBI offering a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to his arrest and conviction. A spokesperson for UnitedHealth Group, the parent company of UnitedHealthcare, reacted to news of Manigone's arrest in a statement to BI, saying: \"Our hope is that today's apprehension brings some relief to Brian's family, friends, colleagues and the many others affected by this unspeakable tragedy. We thank law enforcement and will continue to work with them on this investigation. We ask that everyone respect the family's privacy as they mourn.\" This story is developing and will be updated.

                "content": "Manage your account A suspect in the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was arrested on five charges after a gun and suppressor were found in his possession at a McDonald's in Pennsylvania, a criminal complaint shows. Luigi Mangione, 26, was apprehended in Altoona, about 100 miles east of Pittsburgh, after police found a gun \"consistent\" with the firearm used during the shooting that occurred Wednesday in Midtown Manhattan, New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said at a Manhattan news conference on Monday. The gun used in Thompson's murder is believed to have been a \"ghost gun\" assembled with a 3D printer, NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said. During the news conference, Kenny said New York police detectives were en route to Altoona to interview Mangione. Further charges related to Thompson's shooting would be determined by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, according to the chief. Here is what Mangione has been charged with, as of Monday evening. Mangione faces five charges in Pennsylvania, according to a criminal complaint and docket sheet viewed by USA TODAY: One count of forgery (grade 2 felony) One count of carrying a firearm without a license (grade 3 felony) One count of tampering with records or identification (grade 1 misdemeanor) One count of possessing instruments of crime (grade 1 misdemeanor) One count of false identification to law enforcement (grade 3 misdemeanor) Altoona Deputy Chief Derek Swope said at a Monday press conference that Mangione was taken into custody on a forgery charge after authorities discovered a fake New Jersey ID in his possession. Mangione was also expected to face a homicide charge, Blair County District Attorney Peter Weeks said at a Monday evening news conference. According to the Scranton, Pennsylvania-based firm Kalinoski Law, carrying a firearm without a license can range from a first-degree misdemeanor to a third-degree felony, depending on the circumstances of the situation. Concealing a firearm is a separate charge and is considered a third-degree felony in Pennsylvania, according to attorney Price Benowitz's firm. Mangione's arrest and Thompson's murder comes months after the Pennsylvania House of Representatives passed HB 777, also known as the \"Ghost Gun\" bill, which aims to ban homemade and 3D-printed firearms in the state. The passage of the bill occurred in April after a 104-to-97 vote, Pennsylvania General Assembly records show. If the state Senate and governor go on to approve the bill, then it would make it a third-degree felony to sell or transfer any firearm parts or accessories that are \"not imprinted with a serial number registered with a federal firearms licensee,\" according to the bill's text. \"The proliferation of 'ghost guns' used in violent crimes throughout Pennsylvania and the nation has risen to a dangerous level,\" Rep. Morgan Cephas and Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta wrote in a memorandum in 2023. \"These guns, either pieced together from kits, or assembled from the sale of individual parts, are causing law enforcement and communities to grapple with an ever changing and illusive problem, one with fatal consequences.\" Contributing: Jay Cannon, Nick Penzenstadler and Michael Loria, USA TODAY This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Luigi Mangione charges: What to know about his offenses in CEO's death",

                "title": "Shooting suspect Luigi Mangione worked as Stanford counselor",
                "content": "Luigi Mangione, whom police arrested and identified Monday as a “strong person of interest” in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last Wednesday, was employed as a head counselor for Stanford’s pre-collegiate studies program between May and September of 2019, a University spokesperson confirmed to The Daily. Thompson’s fatal shooting outside of a hotel in midtown Manhattan last week triggered a high-profile manhunt to identify his assailant based on surveillance footage. The murder also drew mocking and celebratory reactions from social media users, who have vented frustration with the American healthcare insurance industry. “We believe we have a strong person of interest,” New York City Mayor Eric Adams said, referring to Mangione at a press conference Monday. Authorities said that Mangione, who was carrying fraudulent IDs and a firearm, was arrested on charges unrelated to the case. Police also said they recovered a document that expressed Mangione’s motivations and “ill will” toward corporations. According to his LinkedIn profile, Mangione “designed lesson plans and taught artificial intelligence to gifted high school students” and “led a 7-member residential staff” during the summer studies program at Stanford. The program offers academic courses to high school students from around the world, both on the Stanford campus and online. Mangione shared photos from the summer of 2019 on Facebook and Instagram that showed him posing with fellow counselors at various campus locations, including Lake Lagunita. The Facebook album was captioned “KAotic summers only,” referring to the Kappa Alpha house, where Mangione appeared to live and work as an RA for the program. Both Facebook and Instagram deleted his profiles Monday. The University did not immediately respond to a request to confirm Mangione’s residence that summer. A 26-year-old graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, Mangione received bachelor’s and master’s degrees in computer and information science. He was born and raised in Maryland, graduated as valedictorian from the private all-boys school Gilman and appeared to belong to the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity chapter at UPenn. The news of Mangione’s arrest sparked extensive online investigation of his past, with users locating his high school valedictorian speech and social media profiles. Online commentators have noted that he wrote a positive review of the Unabomber’s manifesto on Goodreads and praised him as a “political revolutionary.” On X, Mangione followed various public figures, including Sam Harris, Joe Rogan and Stanford Medicine Professor Andrew Huberman, whom he retweeted in June. The words “deny,” “depose” and “defend” were written on bullet shell casings found at the scene of the shooting. Investigators have linked these messages to denied insurance claims, a major theme in accusations of greed against insurance companies. Thompson’s wife told NBC that her husband had previously received threats, possibly related to medical coverage. This story is breaking and will be updated.

            {
                "title": "Daniel Penny found not guilty in chokehold death of Jordan Neely",
                "content": "Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Daniel Penny was acquitted Monday of criminally negligent homicide in the chokehold death of Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old homeless man with a history of mental illness whose final moments on a New York City subway train were captured on bystander video that set off weeks of protests and drew national attention. The decision, on the fifth day of deliberations, came after the jury deadlocked Friday on the more serious charge of manslaughter, leading the judge to dismiss it. Penny faced up to four years in prison. As the jury foreperson read the “not guilty” verdict, some observers in the courtroom applauded. Others began to audibly sob and yell, including Neely’s father, Andre Zachery, who was escorted out. “This is America. That is the sound of Black pain,” one person said outside of the courtroom in Lower Manhattan to the reaction. Chants of “no justice, no peace,” could be heard echoing from outside. The case divided people in New York — and beyond — in some cases along political and racial lines. Neely was Black. Penny is white. Some people viewed Penny as callous and his actions as criminal on the day he encountered Neely, who had been shouting and acting erratically when he boarded a subway train in Manhattan on May 1, 2023. Others contend Penny was selfless in his attempt to protect fellow passengers. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said he respected the jury's verdict. The jury deliberated for about an hour on the criminally negligent homicide charge after about four days spent considering the manslaughter charge. “Their lengthy deliberation — and the totality of the facts and the evidence — underscored why this case was put in front of a jury of Mr. Penny's peers,” Bragg said in a statement. The anonymous jury, made up of seven women and five men, were told before they began deliberating that they had to come to a unanimous decision on the top charge of manslaughter in the second degree before moving on to consider criminally negligent homicide. But Judge Maxwell Wiley changed that order Friday after jurors twice sent a note saying they could not reach an agreement. The judge had also instructed jurors to decide whether Penny’s actions caused Neely’s death and, if so, whether he had acted recklessly and in an unjustified manner. Before he encountered Penny, Neely, a former Michael Jackson impersonator, ranted about being hungry and thirsty and said that he wanted to return to jail and didn’t care if he lived or died, witnesses testified. Penny, 26, a former Marine and Long Island native, placed Neely in a chokehold that prosecutors said lasted almost six minutes. A New York City medical examiner ruled that Neely died from compression to his neck as a result of the chokehold. Neely’s uncle, Christopher Neely, said he was “taken aback” as the verdict was announced because he thought the jury would at least convict him on the lesser charge. “At least give him a charge because it should be some type of penalty that should have been been handed down to Danny Penny period. They gave him no penalty, and I feel like the jury gave up on us,” Neely said. Donte Mills, a lawyer representing Neely's family, said at a news conference that he was disheartened by the verdict Monday, as supporters held up a picture of Neely dressed as Jackson. Mills asked that Neely's death have meaning, and urged that others, instead of becoming physical with someone who may be hungry, offer them food. “He had a muffin in his pocket,” Mills said of what police later discovered in Neely's jacket. “Jordan just wanted someone to acknowledge him on the train, but instead, he was choked to death.” Lawyers for Penny could not immediately be reached for comment about the verdict, but had earlier expressed concern Monday to the judge that the jury could be influenced by the demonstrators' chanting coming from outside the courthouse. During the trial, Penny’s attorneys told jurors that he stepped in because he believed Neely might attack other passengers and he intended only to restrain him until police arrived, which Penny also told police. They also argued that Neely was not killed by the chokehold and that it was impossible to measure how much pressure Penny had applied. A forensic pathologist hired by the defense testified that Neely died from a combination of his schizophrenia, synthetic marijuana, sickle cell trait and the struggle from being in Penny’s restraint. But the medical examiner who performed the autopsy on Neely, Dr. Cynthia Harris, told jurors it was her medical opinion “that there are no alternative reasonable explanations” for his death and that those proposed by the defense were “so improbable — that it stands shoulder to shoulder with impossibility.” During cross-examination, one of Penny’s attorneys, Steven Raiser sought to cast doubt on Harris’ testimony about how she and her colleagues had come to a unanimous decision as to Neely’s cause of death. Raiser suggested that they had failed to consider all the facts before making that determination. He revisited that claim in his closing argument last week. “I submit to you there was a rush to judgment, based on something other than medical science,” he told jurors. The case also spurred debates about safety within the city’s subway system and failures in addressing homelessness and mental illness, both of which Neely had struggled with. Jumaane Williams, a Black Democrat who is New York City’s public advocate, was among those who questioned why police let Penny go after questioning him at a precinct hours after Neely’s killing. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, also a Democrat, said Neely had been “murdered.” Prominent Republicans like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Matt Gaetz praised Penny and promoted a fundraiser for his legal fund, which has raised more than $3 million. His defense team includes Thomas Kenniff, a Republican who ran unsuccessfully for Manhattan District Attorney in 2021. Vice President-elect JD Vance said on X in response to the verdict that “justice was done in this case. It was a scandal Penny was ever prosecuted in the first place.” Prosecutors did not dispute that Neely’s actions on the train scared many of the passengers or that he was on synthetic cannabinoids, which were found in his system. In her opening statement, Dafna Yoran, an assistant prosecutor with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, said that Neely had “demanded to be seen” and that despite his not having touched anyone and not having displayed a weapon or threatened to use one, many people in the subway car were frightened of what he might do. She has said Penny’s “initial intent was even laudable,” but that he was reckless when he continued to choke Neely even after he posed no threat, including after the train doors had opened at the next station and passengers could exit. For some of that time, she said and video showed, two other men helped restrain Neely. One of those men testified that he believed Penny had held the chokehold for too long. At times, Yoran said, he even ignored the pleas of bystanders to let Neely go. In her closing argument, Yoran said that “no one had to die” and that Penny was not justified in his use of physical deadly force. “You obviously cannot kill someone because they are crazy and ranting and looking menacing,” Yoran told jurors in her closing argument. “No matter what it is that they are saying.” She also said that Penny “could have easily restrained” Neely “without choking him to death.” In his closing argument, Raiser prompted jurors to imagine that they were on the train the day Neely boarded “filled with rage and not afraid of any consequences.” “With you sitting much as you are now in this tightly confined space, looking up at Mr. Neely,” he said. “You have very little room to move and nowhere to run.” “Danny,” as the defense attorneys referred to Penny throughout the trial, “put his life on the line” and stepped up in the absence of police, Raiser said. But Yoran challenged the portrayal of Penny as a self-sacrificing and benevolent subway rider. In her opening statement she said that Penny failed to acknowledge Neely’s humanity. She continued that thread in her closing argument, playing video of Penny twice referring to Neely as a “crackhead” in an interview with police and telling jurors that he never asked about Neely’s condition. “There is something else that is glaringly missing from his statement. Any regret. Any remorse. Any self reflection,” she said. She added: “He never expresses any sorrow about the man’s death.” During deliberations, jurors asked to rewatch bystander videos of Penny restraining Neely, responding officers’ body camera videos and video of Penny’s subsequent interview with two police detectives at a precinct. They also asked to rehear the medical examiner’s testimony about issuing a death certificate before Neely’s full toxicology reports were completed. They also asked for the judge to read back the definitions of recklessness and criminal negligence and to have the definitions in writing. Penny chose not to testify. During the trial, jurors heard from more than 40 witnesses — subway passengers who witnessed Penny restrain Neely, police officers who responded to the scene, a Marine Corps instructor who taught Penny various chokeholds, the two pathologists, a psychiatric expert and six character witnesses, who included two Marines, Penny’s mother and one of his sisters. On Wednesday, Neely’s father sued Penny accusing him of negligent contact, assault and battery that caused Neely’s death. The civil suit was filed in New York state’s Supreme Court, a trial-level court in New York state. Janelle Griffith is a national reporter for NBC News focusing on issues of race and policing.

                "title": "Daniel Penny verdict reached as jury finds former Marine not guilty",
                "content": "NEW YORK – A jury on Monday found former Marine Daniel Penny not guilty of criminally negligent homicide in the death of Jordan Neely, a homeless man who Penny placed in a chokehold onboard a New York City subway car last year. Around 11:30 a.m. Monday, the jury told the judge they reached a unanimous verdict on the second count in the case. The more serious charge of second-degree manslaughter was dismissed Friday after the jury was unable to reach a verdict on it. The case catapulted into the national spotlight after video of the chokehold went viral following Neely's death, which a New York City medical examiner ruled was caused by \"compression of the neck.\" Neely suffered from schizophrenia, was high on synthetic marijuana and was shouting that he was hungry, thirsty and \"fed up\" seconds before Penny put him in a restraint learned during training with the Marine Corps. In a trial that lasted more than six weeks, the prosecution argued Penny, 26, was negligent in keeping the unarmed Neely in a chokehold for about six minutes, even after he stopped resisting. The defense said Penny was defending fellow passengers after Neely threatened to kill them and acted \"psychotic.\" Defense attorney Steve Raiser said Monday he wouldn't yet comment on the case. When the first count was dropped on Friday he said his team hoped Penny could soon put the \"nightmare\" behind him, and lawyers could begin focusing on a civil lawsuit brought against him by Neely's father over his son's death. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said in a statement, \"we deeply respect the jury process and we respect their verdict.'' He also said it was \"unacceptable'' prosecutors were subjected to threats over the case, which drew public protests. Neely had been screaming at passengers before Penny subdued him by putting him in a chokehold to prevent him from harming anyone, the defense argued. Prosecutors said Penny recklessly used too much force for too long, starving the 30-year-old former Michael Jackson tribute artist of oxygen. Late Friday afternoon, the prosecution asked the judge to dismiss the charge of second-degree manslaughter after the jury deadlocked. A lawyer for Neely's family said it was “unfathomable” the jury acquitted Penny, an opinion shared by supporters who believe the former Marine's extended chokehold snuffed out Neely's life. “We thought that the system would be there for us, but it was not,” attorney Donte Mills, who is representing Neely's family in a civil suit, told USA TODAY. Mills said that while some are calling Penny a hero for subduing Neely after he started screaming in a subway car, “Jordan didn’t have a hero” that day. Now, Mills said, his team will continue to seek justice for Neely through a civil lawsuit filed against Penny by Neely’s father, Andre Zachery, who was not available for comment. Second-degree manslaughter would have required the jury to find Penny acted recklessly when he held Neely in the chokehold – that he knew Neely’s life was at risk but kept squeezing his neck, the prosecution argued. Criminally negligent homicide would have required that the jury find that Penny failed to recognize that Neely’s life was at risk as he struggled to breathe while being held in the chokehold, according to documents filed by prosecutors. At the start of the trial, Judge Max Wiley instructed the jury they must agree on the charge of second-degree manslaughter before they could consider the criminally negligent homicide charge. If the jury found Penny not guilty on the first charge, both would be dropped, Wiley said. When the jury told Wiley they were deadlocked on the first count Friday, Wiley asked them to keep deliberating, but they remained stalled. That’s when prosecutors asked the judge to drop the charge of second-degree manslaughter. Penny's defense argued Neely was acting \"psychotic\" and threatened to kill people in the subway car. Penny stepped in to protect all the people on board, several of whom Neely lunged at before Penny placed him in the chokehold, defense attorney Thomas Kenniff said. Passengers had no way of knowing Neely did not have a weapon on him, Kenniff said, and several passengers feared for their lives. The defense team also argued Penny's chokehold alone could not have caused Neely's death, and that Neely suffered an extreme sickle cell crisis on the train floor, blocking the flow of oxygen. However, a medical examiner testified Neely's death was caused by \"compression of the neck,\" and not other health issues. During the trial, which began with jury selection on Oct. 21, Penny was accused of recklessly disregarding the risk his chokehold would lead to Neely's death that day on the train car floor. Prosecutor Dafna Yoran argued Penny should have known Neely's life was at risk because of the long chokehold. Yoran also argued Penny was unnecessarily reckless when he continued to hold Neely's neck long after Neely stopped posing a threat to passengers. The prosecution argued Penny did not hesitate before placing Neely in a chokehold and failed to try to defuse the situation another way. Another bystander who came to Penny's aid offered to hold Neely's arms down so Penny could let go of Neely's neck, but instead, Penny kept a tight hold even after Neely's body went limp, Yoran told jurors. \"He used far too much force for far too long,\" Yoran said. Considering the jury was deadlocked after four days of discussion, including after the judge told them to keep deliberating, it’s “peculiar” they reached a unanimous verdict of not guilty on the second charge with such speed, said Nicole Brenecki, a Brooklyn-based trial expert who has followed the case. “I was really surprised that that’s how quickly they came back,” Brenecki, who was not involved in the case, told USA TODAY. Brenecki said it’s possible some members of the jury changed their minds about the case over the weekend. After the more serious charge was dropped, it likely would have been easier to reach a guilty verdict on the second charge if the jury was already heading in that direction, she said. “Maybe the jury just decided to jump off the train and acquit,” Brenecki said, adding that Jordan Neely’s death remains an enormous tragedy. Throughout the trial, the jury was faced with a “melting pot” of problems society is grappling with, Brenecki said, like public safety, drug use, mental illness and the homelessness crisis. “He should have been helped, this should have been prevented,” she said. “There’s definitely a discussion and a discourse this sparked.”",

                "title": "Bella Hadid Showed Up on ‘Yellowstone’ For Some Reason",
                "content": "Manage your account WE'RE IN CRUNCH time on what just may be the final season of Yellowstone; the only episode left to air is season 5, episode 14, which just might be the series finale (though Paramount Network's marketing has yet to refer to it as that). There are several storylines still open, several mysteries still to be solved, and several characters desperately needing closure. So, with time running out, what does Yellowstone co-creator and showrunner Taylor Sheridan do? Well, of course, he gives the character played by Taylor Sheridan a whole bunch of screen time and a never-before-seen girlfriend played by a famous supermodel, that's what! Look, guys. At this point, you have to kind of realize that with Yellowstone, this is part of the deal. Sheridan is without a doubt a talented screenwriter; his work on movies like Sicario and Hell or High Water proved that without question. If you want tightly-crafted TV stories from Taylor Sheridan, you can look to something like Lioness or the Yellowstone spinoffs 1883 and 1923. For the last couple years, Sheridan has treated Yellowstone kind of like his free jazz project, with storylines and character beats that come out of nowhere and stop as quickly as they start. He's trying things, and doing whatever he wants—and, look, he made this show into a massive hit, so who could blame him? Sheridan's character on Yellowstone is Travis Wheatley, a famous horse trainer and friend of Rip (Cole Hauser) who's been a recurring character on the show since the very first season. He's always popped in and out, but in season 5, episode 13, titled \"Give the World Away,\" we get to see more of Travis than ever before as Beth travels to his ranch as they try to get his help to sell the Dutton Ranch horses for as much as they possibly can. We already knew that Travis was an expert-level horse trainer, but our extended screen time in this episode showed that he also owns and runs his own ranch, plays a seemingly-constant game of strip poker with younger women in various states of undress, is an expert showman and deceptive salesman, and has a girlfriend played by supermodel Bella Hadid. To Sheridan's credit, while he does write his own character as essentially the best and coolest guy in the world, he does at least make Beth (Kelly Reilly) skeptical. While watching Travis ride and showcase the horses being sold, she asks Sadie (the Bella Hadid character) what, exactly she's doing; he's arrogant, condescending, misogynistic, and 25 years older than her. What is the deal? Sadie doesn't hesitate, and also doesn't deny anything Beth said. But she tells her exactly what it is she is drawn to: he's one hell of a horse-rider. And they both look on in awe, unable to deny his talent there. Ok then! Ultimately, Travis proves to be not only a great horse rider and salesman, but—after messing with Beth a little—a good guy who's willing to help out with the Dutton Ranch firesale. By the end of the episode, they've sold off all of their cattle, horses, and assets, making up $30 million, much thanks to Travis without a doubt. While we'll have to wait for the Yellowstone finale to learn the fate of the Duttons and the Yellowstone ranch, we can be sure of one thing: Travis is living the good life. If you thought Travis's girlfriend, Sadie, on Yellowstone looked familiar, that's because she's played by Bella Hadid—one of the most famous supermodels in the world. At the moment she has 61.5 million Instagram followers. If you're wondering why Bella Hadid made a random surprise guest appearance on Yellowstone as Travis's girlfriend, well, that's a pretty good question. But we've also got a pretty good answer. Bella Hadid's current boyfriend, Adan Banuelos, is a cowboy and horse-trainer in real life—and he also made a cameo in season 5, episode 13 of Yellowstone, as one of the dudes playing in Travis's strip poker game. Since the duo have been dating in the last year and change, she's shown up at all sorts of rodeo and horse-riding events, including at the 2024 American Performance Horseman competition that was held in Arlington, Texas back in March. In addition to her Western swing, Hadid has also begun dabbling in acting. While she's an experienced model and has previously appeared in music videos, she made her TV debut back in 2022 when she played a character named Lena in the third season of Hulu's acclaimed series Ramy. We know that Taylor Sheridan is good to his actors—maybe we'll see her again in one of his shows soon?

This week on Bella-stone... Bella Hadid stunned Yellowstone viewers by making an unexpected cameo on the Dec. 8 episode of the Paramount+ series' final season alongside her professional cowboy boyfriend Adan Banuelos. The model played the role of Sadie, the girlfriend of horse trainer Travis Wheatley, who is played by series creator Taylor Sheridan. The 28-year-old first appeared in the episode answering the door in a cowboy hat and tank top at Travis' Texas ranch after Kelly Reilly's character Beth Dutton shows up for a horse auction and instead finds the group—which includes Adan—playing strip poker. In a subsequent scene, Beth questions why Sadie is dating Travis, who she deems \"misogynistic,\" \"condescending\" and \"the most arrogant man\" she's ever met. She also notes that he's 25 years older than Bella's character. After Sadie asks her if she's \"ever seen him ride before,\" the duo watches him get on a horse, which prompts Beth to admit, \"OK, yeah, I get it.\" Bella—who used to compete in equestrian competitions—put her own skills on display later in the episode when her character rides around during a horse auction at the Yellowstone ranch. Yellowstone viewers were stunned by the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum's cameo, with one person saying that it \"definitely wasn't on my 2024 bingo card.\" Another person joked that \"bella hadid takes that cowboy s--t for real serious cause why is she playing strip poker with taylor sheridan on yellowstone right now.\" A third user called it \"objectively hilarious\" that Yellowstone's creator cast a model as his character's girlfriend on the show. Bella's cowgirl cameo comes over a year into her relationship with Adan, who she was first linked to when they were spotted making out with one another in October 2023. The Victoria's Secret model made thie relationship Instagram official back in February. Just a couple months later, she revealed that she'd moved to Texas—where Adan lives—after becoming disillusioned with modeling. \"After 10 years of modeling,\" Bella told Allure in April, \"I realized I was putting so much energy and love and effort into something that, in the long run, wasn't necessarily giving it back to me.\" The couple did return to New York for an appearance together, though, when they rode horses alongside one another outside of the Horse Sense premiere in Manhattan. \"My love brought Texas to NYC,\" Bella captioned an Instagram carousel post from the event Sept. 17. \"Lucky me.\" Keep reading for the fate of other fan-favorite shows amid Yellowstone's final season.

[+] Horseman by Teton Ridge at Globe Life Field on March 08, 2024 in Arlington, Texas. (Photo by Rob Carr/Getty Images for Teton Ridge) If you’re wondering whether supermodel Bella Hadid appeared in the penultimate episode of Yellowstone Season 5, you are correct. The 28-year-old played the role of Sadie, the girlfriend of Travis Wheatley, a horse trainer portrayed by the show’s creator Taylor Sheridan. Viewers are introduced to Hadid’s character Sadie when Beth Dutton (Kelly Reilly) arrives at Travis’s luxurious Texan ranch. Beth travels to Texas to oversee a horse auction that Travis is hosting, as it is crucial to sell everything in order to settle the debts following her father’s death (Kevin Costner). When Beth opens the door, Sadie asks, “Are you the masseuse?” to which Beth responds, “Do I look like a f—ing masseuse?” Sadie then quips back, “A very expensive one.” As the scene unfolds, it becomes clear to Beth that instead of selling horses, Travis is engaged in a game of strip poker with three blonde women at his house. Beth angrily yells at the horse trainer to come meet the wealthy buyers who are waiting for him. After finally arriving at the auction, Beth asks Hadid’s character what she sees in Travis, calling him \"the most arrogant man I’ve ever met—condescending, misogynistic, and 25 years older than you.\" Sadie responds, \"Have you ever seen him ride before?\" After watching him in the ring, Beth replies, \"Okay, yeah, I get it.\" Beth is ultimately impressed by Travis when he sells a horse for $3 million, partly by having his maintenance crew pose as fake buyers. She then asks him to go to Montana for the auction taking place at Yellowstone Ranch the following day. Hadid’s character Sadie makes another appearance in the episode by riding a horse during the Yellowstone auction. She is dressed in full Western gear, including a cowboy hat, a white tank top, blue jeans with an oversized belt buckle, and a flannel shirt tied around her waist. Her boyfriend Adan Banuelos also makes a cameo in the episode. Fans have had mixed reactions on social media, with many surprised by the appearance, particularly that it was Sheridan’s character who was dating Hadid’s. “Bella Hadid and Kelly Reilly having scenes together on Yellowstone was definitely NOT on my 5B bingo card,” X user @BethDuttonisGod wrote. “Taylor Sheridan making Bella Hadid his girlfriend in 'Yellowstone' is objectively hilarious,” penned another user @spaseycasey. @savysweethart added, “bella hadid in tonight’s episode of yellowstone was a jump scare lol girl wyd here.” NEW YORK, NEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 12: Bella Hadid attends the \"Window To The West\" series premiere at ... [+] Kemo Sabe Pop-Up on September 12, 2024 in New York City. (Photo by Gotham/Getty Images) Bella Hadid grew up riding horses and has competed in several equestrian events in recent years. She also spends a lot of time in Texas with her partner, Adan Banuelos, who is a real-life cowboy. Last month, Banuelos tagged Hadid in an Instagram post to congratulate her on winning her first championship buckle. He wrote, “Our trip to Jackson, Mississippi was well worth it! Bella rode 3 horses and qualified to 7 different finals, bringing home her first CHAMPIONSHIP buckle! We continue to be proud of her in (and out) of the arena ♥️.” In September, Hadid and Banuelos performed a horse riding demonstration in downtown Manhattan to celebrate the premiere of \"Horse Sense,\" a new documentary short starring Banuelos. Hadid shared pictures of the event on Instagram, writing, “My love brought Texas to NYC. Lucky me 🍀.” The Season 5 finale of Yellowstone airs on Sunday, Dec. 15 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on Paramount Network.

                "content": "An earthquake – also called a quake, tremor, or temblor – is the shaking of the Earth's surface resulting from a sudden release of energy in the lithosphere that creates seismic waves. Earthquakes can range in intensity, from those so weak they cannot be felt, to those violent enough to propel objects and people into the air, damage critical infrastructure, and wreak destruction across entire cities. The seismic activity of an area is the frequency, type, and size of earthquakes experienced over a particular time. The seismicity at a particular location in the Earth is the average rate of seismic energy release per unit volume. In its most general sense, the word earthquake is used to describe any seismic event that generates seismic waves. Earthquakes can occur naturally or be induced by human activities, such as mining, fracking, and nuclear tests. The initial point of rupture is called the hypocenter or focus, while the ground level directly above it is the epicenter. Earthquakes are primarily caused by geological faults, but also by volcanic activity, landslides, and other seismic events. The frequency, type, and size of earthquakes in an area define its seismic activity, reflecting the average rate of seismic energy release. Significant historical earthquakes include the 1556 Shaanxi earthquake in China, with over 830,000 fatalities, and the 1960 Valdivia earthquake in Chile, the largest ever recorded at 9.5 magnitude. Earthquakes result in various effects, such as ground shaking and soil liquefaction, leading to significant damage and loss of life. When the epicenter of a large earthquake is located offshore, the seabed may be displaced sufficiently to cause a tsunami. Earthquakes can trigger landslides. Earthquakes' occurrence is influenced by tectonic movements along faults, including normal, reverse (thrust), and strike-slip faults, with energy release and rupture dynamics governed by the elastic-rebound theory. Efforts to manage earthquake risks involve prediction, forecasting, and preparedness, including seismic retrofitting and earthquake engineering to design structures that withstand shaking. The cultural impact of earthquakes spans myths, religious beliefs, and modern media, reflecting their profound influence on human societies. Similar seismic phenomena, known as marsquakes and moonquakes, have been observed on other celestial bodies, indicating the universality of such events beyond Earth. An earthquake is the shaking of the surface of Earth resulting from a sudden release of energy in the lithosphere that creates seismic waves. Earthquakes may also be referred to as quakes, tremors, or temblors. The word tremor is also used for non-earthquake seismic rumbling. In its most general sense, an earthquake is any seismic event—whether natural or caused by humans—that generates seismic waves. Earthquakes are caused mostly by the rupture of geological faults but also by other events such as volcanic activity, landslides, mine blasts, fracking and nuclear tests. An earthquake's point of initial rupture is called its hypocenter or focus. The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter. The seismic activity of an area is the frequency, type, and size of earthquakes experienced over a particular time. The seismicity at a particular location in the Earth is the average rate of seismic energy release per unit volume. One of the most devastating earthquakes in recorded history was the 1556 Shaanxi earthquake, which occurred on 23 January 1556 in Shaanxi, China. More than 830,000 people died.[2] Most houses in the area were yaodongs—dwellings carved out of loess hillsides—and many victims were killed when these structures collapsed. The 1976 Tangshan earthquake, which killed between 240,000 and 655,000 people, was the deadliest of the 20th century.[3] The 1960 Chilean earthquake is the largest earthquake that has been measured on a seismograph, reaching 9.5 magnitude on 22 May 1960.[4][5] Its epicenter was near Cañete, Chile. The energy released was approximately twice that of the next most powerful earthquake, the Good Friday earthquake (27 March 1964), which was centered in Prince William Sound, Alaska.[6][7] The ten largest recorded earthquakes have all been megathrust earthquakes; however, of these ten, only the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake is simultaneously one of the deadliest earthquakes in history. Earthquakes that caused the greatest loss of life, while powerful, were deadly because of their proximity to either heavily populated areas or the ocean, where earthquakes often create tsunamis that can devastate communities thousands of kilometers away. Regions most at risk for great loss of life include those where earthquakes are relatively rare but powerful, and poor regions with lax, unenforced, or nonexistent seismic building codes. Tectonic earthquakes occur anywhere on the earth where there is sufficient stored elastic strain energy to drive fracture propagation along a fault plane. The sides of a fault move past each other smoothly and aseismically only if there are no irregularities or asperities along the fault surface that increases the frictional resistance. Most fault surfaces do have such asperities, which leads to a form of stick-slip behavior. Once the fault has locked, continued relative motion between the plates leads to increasing stress and, therefore, stored strain energy in the volume around the fault surface. This continues until the stress has risen sufficiently to break through the asperity, suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault, releasing the stored energy.[8] This energy is released as a combination of radiated elastic strain seismic waves,[9] frictional heating of the fault surface, and cracking of the rock, thus causing an earthquake. This process of gradual build-up of strain and stress punctuated by occasional sudden earthquake failure is referred to as the elastic-rebound theory. It is estimated that only 10 percent or less of an earthquake's total energy is radiated as seismic energy. Most of the earthquake's energy is used to power the earthquake fracture growth or is converted into heat generated by friction. Therefore, earthquakes lower the Earth's available elastic potential energy and raise its temperature, though these changes are negligible compared to the conductive and convective flow of heat out from the Earth's deep interior.[10] There are three main types of fault, all of which may cause an interplate earthquake: normal, reverse (thrust), and strike-slip. Normal and reverse faulting are examples of dip-slip, where the displacement along the fault is in the direction of dip and where movement on them involves a vertical component. Many earthquakes are caused by movement on faults that have components of both dip-slip and strike-slip; this is known as oblique slip. The topmost, brittle part of the Earth's crust, and the cool slabs of the tectonic plates that are descending into the hot mantle, are the only parts of our planet that can store elastic energy and release it in fault ruptures. Rocks hotter than about 300 °C (572 °F) flow in response to stress; they do not rupture in earthquakes.[11][12] The maximum observed lengths of ruptures and mapped faults (which may break in a single rupture) are approximately 1,000 km (620 mi). Examples are the earthquakes in Alaska (1957), Chile (1960), and Sumatra (2004), all in subduction zones. The longest earthquake ruptures on strike-slip faults, like the San Andreas Fault (1857, 1906), the North Anatolian Fault in Turkey (1939), and the Denali Fault in Alaska (2002), are about half to one third as long as the lengths along subducting plate margins, and those along normal faults are even shorter. Normal faults occur mainly in areas where the crust is being extended such as a divergent boundary. Earthquakes associated with normal faults are generally less than magnitude 7. Maximum magnitudes along many normal faults are even more limited because many of them are located along spreading centers, as in Iceland, where the thickness of the brittle layer is only about six kilometres (3.7 mi).[13][14] Reverse faults occur in areas where the crust is being shortened such as at a convergent boundary. Reverse faults, particularly those along convergent boundaries, are associated with the most powerful earthquakes (called megathrust earthquakes) including almost all of those of magnitude 8 or more. Megathrust earthquakes are responsible for about 90% of the total seismic moment released worldwide.[15] Strike-slip faults are steep structures where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other; transform boundaries are a particular type of strike-slip fault. Strike-slip faults, particularly continental transforms, can produce major earthquakes up to about magnitude 8. Strike-slip faults tend to be oriented near vertically, resulting in an approximate width of 10 km (6.2 mi) within the brittle crust.[16] Thus, earthquakes with magnitudes much larger than 8 are not possible. In addition, there exists a hierarchy of stress levels in the three fault types. Thrust faults are generated by the highest, strike-slip by intermediate, and normal faults by the lowest stress levels.[17] This can easily be understood by considering the direction of the greatest principal stress, the direction of the force that \"pushes\" the rock mass during the faulting. In the case of normal faults, the rock mass is pushed down in a vertical direction, thus the pushing force (greatest principal stress) equals the weight of the rock mass itself. In the case of thrusting, the rock mass \"escapes\" in the direction of the least principal stress, namely upward, lifting the rock mass, and thus, the overburden equals the least principal stress. Strike-slip faulting is intermediate between the other two types described above. This difference in stress regime in the three faulting environments can contribute to differences in stress drop during faulting, which contributes to differences in the radiated energy, regardless of fault dimensions. For every unit increase in magnitude, there is a roughly thirty-fold increase in the energy released. For instance, an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 releases approximately 32 times more energy than a 5.0 magnitude earthquake and a 7.0 magnitude earthquake releases 1,000 times more energy than a 5.0 magnitude earthquake. An 8.6-magnitude earthquake releases the same amount of energy as 10,000 atomic bombs of the size used in World War II.[18] This is so because the energy released in an earthquake, and thus its magnitude, is proportional to the area of the fault that ruptures[19] and the stress drop. Therefore, the longer the length and the wider the width of the faulted area, the larger the resulting magnitude. The most important parameter controlling the maximum earthquake magnitude on a fault, however, is not the maximum available length, but the available width because the latter varies by a factor of 20. Along converging plate margins, the dip angle of the rupture plane is very shallow, typically about 10 degrees.[20] Thus, the width of the plane within the top brittle crust of the Earth can reach 50–100 km (31–62 mi) (such as in Japan, 2011, or in Alaska, 1964), making the most powerful earthquakes possible. The majority of tectonic earthquakes originate in the Ring of Fire at depths not exceeding tens of kilometers. Earthquakes occurring at a depth of less than 70 km (43 mi) are classified as \"shallow-focus\" earthquakes, while those with a focal depth between 70 and 300 km (43 and 186 mi) are commonly termed \"mid-focus\" or \"intermediate-depth\" earthquakes. In subduction zones, where older and colder oceanic crust descends beneath another tectonic plate, deep-focus earthquakes may occur at much greater depths (ranging from 300 to 700 km (190 to 430 mi)).[21] These seismically active areas of subduction are known as Wadati–Benioff zones. Deep-focus earthquakes occur at a depth where the subducted lithosphere should no longer be brittle, due to the high temperature and pressure. A possible mechanism for the generation of deep-focus earthquakes is faulting caused by olivine undergoing a phase transition into a spinel structure.[22] Earthquakes often occur in volcanic regions and are caused there, both by tectonic faults and the movement of magma in volcanoes. Such earthquakes can serve as an early warning of volcanic eruptions, as during the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens.[23] Earthquake swarms can serve as markers for the location of the flowing magma throughout the volcanoes. These swarms can be recorded by seismometers and tiltmeters (a device that measures ground slope) and used as sensors to predict imminent or upcoming eruptions.[24] A tectonic earthquake begins as an area of initial slip on the fault surface that forms the focus. Once the rupture has been initiated, it begins to propagate away from the focus, spreading out along the fault surface. Lateral propagation will continue until either the rupture reaches a barrier, such as the end of a fault segment, or a region on the fault where there is insufficient stress to allow continued rupture. For larger earthquakes, the depth extent of rupture will be constrained downwards by the brittle-ductile transition zone and upwards by the ground surface. The mechanics of this process are poorly understood because it is difficult either to recreate such rapid movements in a laboratory or to record seismic waves close to a nucleation zone due to strong ground motion.[25] In most cases, the rupture speed approaches, but does not exceed, the shear wave (S wave) velocity of the surrounding rock. There are a few exceptions to this: Supershear earthquake ruptures are known to have propagated at speeds greater than the S wave velocity. These have so far all been observed during large strike-slip events. The unusually wide zone of damage caused by the 2001 Kunlun earthquake has been attributed to the effects of the sonic boom developed in such earthquakes. Slow earthquake ruptures travel at unusually low velocities. A particularly dangerous form of slow earthquake is the tsunami earthquake, observed where the relatively low felt intensities, caused by the slow propagation speed of some great earthquakes, fail to alert the population of the neighboring coast, as in the 1896 Sanriku earthquake.[25] During an earthquake, high temperatures can develop at the fault plane, increasing pore pressure and consequently vaporization of the groundwater already contained within the rock.[27][28][29] In the coseismic phase, such an increase can significantly affect slip evolution and speed, in the post-seismic phase it can control the Aftershock sequence because, after the main event, pore pressure increase slowly propagates into the surrounding fracture network.[30][29] From the point of view of the Mohr-Coulomb strength theory, an increase in fluid pressure reduces the normal stress acting on the fault plane that holds it in place, and fluids can exert a lubricating effect. As thermal overpressurization may provide positive feedback between slip and strength fall at the fault plane, a common opinion is that it may enhance the faulting process instability. After the mainshock, the pressure gradient between the fault plane and the neighboring rock causes a fluid flow that increases pore pressure in the surrounding fracture networks; such an increase may trigger new faulting processes by reactivating adjacent faults, giving rise to aftershocks.[30][29] Analogously, artificial pore pressure increase, by fluid injection in Earth's crust, may induce seismicity. Tides may trigger some seismicity. Most earthquakes form part of a sequence, related to each other in terms of location and time.[31] Most earthquake clusters consist of small tremors that cause little to no damage, but there is a theory that earthquakes can recur in a regular pattern.[32] Earthquake clustering has been observed, for example, in Parkfield, California where a long-term research study is being conducted around the Parkfield earthquake cluster.[33] An aftershock is an earthquake that occurs after a previous earthquake, the mainshock. Rapid changes of stress between rocks, and the stress from the original earthquake are the main causes of these aftershocks,[34] along with the crust around the ruptured fault plane as it adjusts to the effects of the mainshock.[31] An aftershock is in the same region as the main shock but always of a smaller magnitude, however, they can still be powerful enough to cause even more damage to buildings that were already previously damaged from the mainshock.[34] If an aftershock is larger than the mainshock, the aftershock is redesignated as the mainshock and the original main shock is redesignated as a foreshock. Aftershocks are formed as the crust around the displaced fault plane adjusts to the effects of the mainshock.[31] Earthquake swarms are sequences of earthquakes striking in a specific area within a short period. They are different from earthquakes followed by a series of aftershocks by the fact that no single earthquake in the sequence is the main shock, so none has a notably higher magnitude than another. An example of an earthquake swarm is the 2004 activity at Yellowstone National Park.[35] In August 2012, a swarm of earthquakes shook Southern California's Imperial Valley, showing the most recorded activity in the area since the 1970s.[36] Sometimes a series of earthquakes occur in what has been called an earthquake storm, where the earthquakes strike a fault in clusters, each triggered by the shaking or stress redistribution of the previous earthquakes. Similar to aftershocks but on adjacent segments of fault, these storms occur over the course of years, with some of the later earthquakes as damaging as the early ones. Such a pattern was observed in the sequence of about a dozen earthquakes that struck the North Anatolian Fault in Turkey in the 20th century and has been inferred for older anomalous clusters of large earthquakes in the Middle East.[37][38] It is estimated that around 500,000 earthquakes occur each year, detectable with current instrumentation. About 100,000 of these can be felt.[4][5] Minor earthquakes occur very frequently around the world in places like California and Alaska in the U.S., as well as in El Salvador, Mexico, Guatemala, Chile, Peru, Indonesia, the Philippines, Iran, Pakistan, the Azores in Portugal, Turkey, New Zealand, Greece, Italy, India, Nepal, and Japan.[40] Larger earthquakes occur less frequently, the relationship being exponential; for example, roughly ten times as many earthquakes larger than magnitude 4 occur than earthquakes larger than magnitude 5.[41] In the (low seismicity) United Kingdom, for example, it has been calculated that the average recurrences are: an earthquake of 3.7–4.6 every year, an earthquake of 4.7–5.5 every 10 years, and an earthquake of 5.6 or larger every 100 years.[42] This is an example of the Gutenberg–Richter law. The number of seismic stations has increased from about 350 in 1931 to many thousands today. As a result, many more earthquakes are reported than in the past, but this is because of the vast improvement in instrumentation, rather than an increase in the number of earthquakes. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimates that, since 1900, there have been an average of 18 major earthquakes (magnitude 7.0–7.9) and one great earthquake (magnitude 8.0 or greater) per year, and that this average has been relatively stable.[43] In recent years, the number of major earthquakes per year has decreased, though this is probably a statistical fluctuation rather than a systematic trend.[44] More detailed statistics on the size and frequency of earthquakes is available from the United States Geological Survey.[45] A recent increase in the number of major earthquakes has been noted, which could be explained by a cyclical pattern of periods of intense tectonic activity, interspersed with longer periods of low intensity. However, accurate recordings of earthquakes only began in the early 1900s, so it is too early to categorically state that this is the case.[46] Most of the world's earthquakes (90%, and 81% of the largest) take place in the 40,000-kilometre-long (25,000 mi), horseshoe-shaped zone called the circum-Pacific seismic belt, known as the Pacific Ring of Fire, which for the most part bounds the Pacific plate.[47][48] Massive earthquakes tend to occur along other plate boundaries too, such as along the Himalayan Mountains.[49] With the rapid growth of mega-cities such as Mexico City, Tokyo, and Tehran in areas of high seismic risk, some seismologists are warning that a single earthquake may claim the lives of up to three million people.[50] While most earthquakes are caused by the movement of the Earth's tectonic plates, human activity can also produce earthquakes. Activities both above ground and below may change the stresses and strains on the crust, including building reservoirs, extracting resources such as coal or oil, and injecting fluids underground for waste disposal or fracking.[51] Most of these earthquakes have small magnitudes. The 5.7 magnitude 2011 Oklahoma earthquake is thought to have been caused by disposing wastewater from oil production into injection wells,[52] and studies point to the state's oil industry as the cause of other earthquakes in the past century.[53] A Columbia University paper suggested that the 8.0 magnitude 2008 Sichuan earthquake was induced by loading from the Zipingpu Dam,[54] though the link has not been conclusively proved.[55] The instrumental scales used to describe the size of an earthquake began with the Richter scale in the 1930s. It is a relatively simple measurement of an event's amplitude, and its use has become minimal in the 21st century. Seismic waves travel through the Earth's interior and can be recorded by seismometers at great distances. The surface-wave magnitude was developed in the 1950s as a means to measure remote earthquakes and to improve the accuracy for larger events. The moment magnitude scale not only measures the amplitude of the shock but also takes into account the seismic moment (total rupture area, average slip of the fault, and rigidity of the rock). The Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale, the Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale, and the Mercalli intensity scale are based on the observed effects and are related to the intensity of shaking. The shaking of the earth is a common phenomenon that has been experienced by humans from the earliest of times. Before the development of strong-motion accelerometers, the intensity of a seismic event was estimated based on the observed effects. Magnitude and intensity are not directly related and calculated using different methods. The magnitude of an earthquake is a single value that describes the size of the earthquake at its source. Intensity is the measure of shaking at different locations around the earthquake. Intensity values vary from place to place, depending on the distance from the earthquake and the underlying rock or soil makeup.[56] The first scale for measuring earthquake magnitudes was developed by Charles Francis Richter in 1935. Subsequent scales (seismic magnitude scales) have retained a key feature, where each unit represents a ten-fold difference in the amplitude of the ground shaking and a 32-fold difference in energy. Subsequent scales are also adjusted to have approximately the same numeric value within the limits of the scale.[57] Although the mass media commonly reports earthquake magnitudes as \"Richter magnitude\" or \"Richter scale\", standard practice by most seismological authorities is to express an earthquake's strength on the moment magnitude scale, which is based on the actual energy released by an earthquake, the static seismic moment.[58][59] Every earthquake produces different types of seismic waves, which travel through rock with different velocities: Propagation velocity of the seismic waves through solid rock ranges from approx. 3 km/s (1.9 mi/s) up to 13 km/s (8.1 mi/s), depending on the density and elasticity of the medium. In the Earth's interior, the shock- or P waves travel much faster than the S waves (approx. relation 1.7:1). The differences in travel time from the epicenter to the observatory are a measure of the distance and can be used to image both sources of earthquakes and structures within the Earth. Also, the depth of the hypocenter can be computed roughly. P wave speed S waves speed As a consequence, the first waves of a distant earthquake arrive at an observatory via the Earth's mantle. On average, the kilometer distance to the earthquake is the number of seconds between the P- and S wave times 8.[60] Slight deviations are caused by inhomogeneities of subsurface structure. By such analysis of seismograms, the Earth's core was located in 1913 by Beno Gutenberg. S waves and later arriving surface waves do most of the damage compared to P waves. P waves squeeze and expand the material in the same direction they are traveling, whereas S waves shake the ground up and down and back and forth.[61] Earthquakes are not only categorized by their magnitude but also by the place where they occur. The world is divided into 754 Flinn–Engdahl regions (F-E regions), which are based on political and geographical boundaries as well as seismic activity. More active zones are divided into smaller F-E regions whereas less active zones belong to larger F-E regions. Standard reporting of earthquakes includes its magnitude, date and time of occurrence, geographic coordinates of its epicenter, depth of the epicenter, geographical region, distances to population centers, location uncertainty, several parameters that are included in USGS earthquake reports (number of stations reporting, number of observations, etc.), and a unique event ID.[62] Although relatively slow seismic waves have traditionally been used to detect earthquakes, scientists realized in 2016 that gravitational measurement could provide instantaneous detection of earthquakes, and confirmed this by analyzing gravitational records associated with the 2011 Tohoku-Oki (\"Fukushima\") earthquake.[63][64] The effects of earthquakes include, but are not limited to, the following: Shaking and ground rupture are the main effects created by earthquakes, principally resulting in more or less severe damage to buildings and other rigid structures. The severity of the local effects depends on the complex combination of the earthquake magnitude, the distance from the epicenter, and the local geological and geomorphological conditions, which may amplify or reduce wave propagation.[65] The ground-shaking is measured by ground acceleration. Specific local geological, geomorphological, and geostructural features can induce high levels of shaking on the ground surface even from low-intensity earthquakes. This effect is called site or local amplification. It is principally due to the transfer of the seismic motion from hard deep soils to soft superficial soils and the effects of seismic energy focalization owing to the typical geometrical setting of such deposits. Ground rupture is a visible breaking and displacement of the Earth's surface along the trace of the fault, which may be of the order of several meters in the case of major earthquakes. Ground rupture is a major risk for large engineering structures such as dams, bridges, and nuclear power stations and requires careful mapping of existing faults to identify any that are likely to break the ground surface within the life of the structure.[66] Soil liquefaction occurs when, because of the shaking, water-saturated granular material (such as sand) temporarily loses its strength and transforms from a solid to a liquid. Soil liquefaction may cause rigid structures, like buildings and bridges, to tilt or sink into the liquefied deposits. For example, in the 1964 Alaska earthquake, soil liquefaction caused many buildings to sink into the ground, eventually collapsing upon themselves.[67] Physical damage from an earthquake will vary depending on the intensity of shaking in a given area and the type of population. Underserved and developing communities frequently experience more severe impacts (and longer lasting) from a seismic event compared to well-developed communities.[68] Impacts may include: With these impacts and others, the aftermath may bring disease, a lack of basic necessities, mental consequences such as panic attacks and depression to survivors,[69] and higher insurance premiums. Recovery times will vary based on the level of damage and the socioeconomic status of the impacted community. Earthquakes can produce slope instability leading to landslides, a major geological hazard. Landslide danger may persist while emergency personnel is attempting rescue work.[70] Earthquakes can cause fires by damaging electrical power or gas lines. In the event of water mains rupturing and a loss of pressure, it may also become difficult to stop the spread of a fire once it has started. For example, more deaths in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake were caused by fire than by the earthquake itself.[71] Tsunamis are long-wavelength, long-period sea waves produced by the sudden or abrupt movement of large volumes of water—including when an earthquake occurs at sea. In the open ocean, the distance between wave crests can surpass 100 kilometres (62 mi), and the wave periods can vary from five minutes to one hour. Such tsunamis travel 600–800 kilometers per hour (373–497 miles per hour), depending on water depth. Large waves produced by an earthquake or a submarine landslide can overrun nearby coastal areas in a matter of minutes. Tsunamis can also travel thousands of kilometers across open ocean and wreak destruction on far shores hours after the earthquake that generated them.[72] Ordinarily, subduction earthquakes under magnitude 7.5 do not cause tsunamis, although some instances of this have been recorded. Most destructive tsunamis are caused by earthquakes of magnitude 7.5 or more.[72] Floods may be secondary effects of earthquakes if dams are damaged. Earthquakes may cause landslips to dam rivers, which collapse and cause floods.[73] The terrain below the Sarez Lake in Tajikistan is in danger of catastrophic flooding if the landslide dam formed by the earthquake, known as the Usoi Dam, were to fail during a future earthquake. Impact projections suggest the flood could affect roughly five million people.[74] Earthquake prediction is a branch of the science of seismology concerned with the specification of the time, location, and magnitude of future earthquakes within stated limits.[75] Many methods have been developed for predicting the time and place in which earthquakes will occur. Despite considerable research efforts by seismologists, scientifically reproducible predictions cannot yet be made to a specific day or month.[76] Popular belief holds earthquakes are preceded by earthquake weather, in the early morning.[77][78] While forecasting is usually considered to be a type of prediction, earthquake forecasting is often differentiated from earthquake prediction. Earthquake forecasting is concerned with the probabilistic assessment of general earthquake hazards, including the frequency and magnitude of damaging earthquakes in a given area over years or decades.[79] For well-understood faults the probability that a segment may rupture during the next few decades can be estimated.[80][81] Earthquake warning systems have been developed that can provide regional notification of an earthquake in progress, but before the ground surface has begun to move, potentially allowing people within the system's range to seek shelter before the earthquake's impact is felt. The objective of earthquake engineering is to foresee the impact of earthquakes on buildings, bridges, tunnels, roadways, and other structures, and to design such structures to minimize the risk of damage. Existing structures can be modified by seismic retrofitting to improve their resistance to earthquakes. Earthquake insurance can provide building owners with financial protection against losses resulting from earthquakes. Emergency management strategies can be employed by a government or organization to mitigate risks and prepare for consequences. Artificial intelligence may help to assess buildings and plan precautionary operations. The Igor expert system is part of a mobile laboratory that supports the procedures leading to the seismic assessment of masonry buildings and the planning of retrofitting operations on them. It has been applied to assess buildings in Lisbon, Rhodes, and Naples.[82] Individuals can also take preparedness steps like securing water heaters and heavy items that could injure someone, locating shutoffs for utilities, and being educated about what to do when the shaking starts. For areas near large bodies of water, earthquake preparedness encompasses the possibility of a tsunami caused by a large earthquake. From the lifetime of the Greek philosopher Anaxagoras in the 5th century BCE to the 14th century CE, earthquakes were usually attributed to \"air (vapors) in the cavities of the Earth.\"[83] Thales of Miletus (625–547 BCE) was the only documented person who believed that earthquakes were caused by tension between the earth and water.[83] Other theories existed, including the Greek philosopher Anaxamines' (585–526 BCE) beliefs that short incline episodes of dryness and wetness caused seismic activity. The Greek philosopher Democritus (460–371 BCE) blamed water in general for earthquakes.[83] Pliny the Elder called earthquakes \"underground thunderstorms\".[83] In Norse mythology, earthquakes were explained as the violent struggle of the god Loki. When Loki, god of mischief and strife, murdered Baldr, god of beauty and light, he was punished by being bound in a cave with a poisonous serpent placed above his head dripping venom. Loki's wife Sigyn stood by him with a bowl to catch the poison, but whenever she had to empty the bowl, the poison dripped on Loki's face, forcing him to jerk his head away and thrash against his bonds, which caused the earth to tremble.[84] In Greek mythology, Poseidon was the cause and god of earthquakes. When he was in a bad mood, he struck the ground with a trident, causing earthquakes and other calamities. He also used earthquakes to punish and inflict fear upon people as revenge.[85] In Japanese mythology, Namazu (鯰) is a giant catfish who causes earthquakes. Namazu lives in the mud beneath the earth and is guarded by the god Kashima, who restrains the fish with a stone. When Kashima lets his guard fall, Namazu thrashes about, causing violent earthquakes.[86] In the New Testament, Matthew's Gospel refers to earthquakes occurring both after the death of Jesus (Matthew 27:51, 54) and at his resurrection (Matthew 28:2).[87] Earthquakes form part of the picture through which Jesus portrays the beginning of the end of time.[88] In modern popular culture, the portrayal of earthquakes is shaped by the memory of great cities laid waste, such as Kobe in 1995 or San Francisco in 1906.[89] Fictional earthquakes tend to strike suddenly and without warning.[89] For this reason, stories about earthquakes generally begin with the disaster and focus on its immediate aftermath, as in Short Walk to Daylight (1972), The Ragged Edge (1968) or Aftershock: Earthquake in New York (1999).[89] A notable example is Heinrich von Kleist's classic novella, The Earthquake in Chile, which describes the destruction of Santiago in 1647. Haruki Murakami's short fiction collection After the Quake depicts the consequences of the Kobe earthquake of 1995. The most popular single earthquake in fiction is the hypothetical \"Big One\" expected of California's San Andreas Fault someday, as depicted in the novels Richter 10 (1996), Goodbye California (1977), 2012 (2009), and San Andreas (2015), among other works.[89] Jacob M. Appel's widely anthologized short story, A Comparative Seismology, features a con artist who convinces an elderly woman that an apocalyptic earthquake is imminent.[90] Contemporary depictions of earthquakes in film are variable in the manner in which they reflect human psychological reactions to the actual trauma that can be caused to directly afflicted families and their loved ones.[91] Disaster mental health response research emphasizes the need to be aware of the different roles of loss of family and key community members, loss of home and familiar surroundings, and loss of essential supplies and services to maintain survival.[92][93] Particularly for children, the clear availability of caregiving adults who can protect, nourish, and clothe them in the aftermath of the earthquake and help them make sense of what has befallen them is more important to their emotional and physical health than the simple giving of provisions.[94] As was observed after other disasters involving destruction and loss of life and their media depictions, recently observed in the 2010 Haiti earthquake, it is also believed to be important not to pathologize the reactions to loss and displacement or disruption of governmental administration and services, but rather to validate the reactions to support constructive problem-solving and reflection.[95] Phenomena similar to earthquakes have been observed on other planets (e.g., marsquakes on Mars) and on the Moon (e.g., moonquakes).",

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Over the centuries, earthquakes have been responsible for millions of deaths and an incalculable amount of damage to property. Depending on their intensity, earthquakes (specifically, the degree to which they cause the ground’s surface to shake) can topple buildings and bridges, rupture gas pipelines and other infrastructure, and trigger landslides, tsunamis, and volcanoes. These phenomena are primarily responsible for deaths and injuries. Very great earthquakes occur on average about once per year. Earthquake waves, more commonly known as seismic waves, are vibrations generated by an earthquake and propagated within Earth or along its surface. There are four principal types of elastic waves: two, primary and secondary waves, travel within Earth, whereas the other two, Rayleigh and Love waves, called surface waves, travel along its surface. In addition, seismic waves can be produced artificially by explosions. Magnitude is a measure of the amplitude (height) of the seismic waves an earthquake’s source produces as recorded by seismographs. Seismologist Charles F. Richter created an earthquake magnitude scale using the logarithm of the largest seismic wave’s amplitude to base 10. Richter’s scale was originally for measuring the magnitude of earthquakes from magnitudes 3 to 7, limiting its usefulness. Today the moment magnitude scale, a closer measure of an earthquake’s total energy release, is preferred. Earthquakes can occur anywhere, but they occur mainly along fault lines (planar or curved fractures in the rocks of Earth’s crust), where compressional or tensional forces move rocks on opposite sides of a fracture. Faults extend from a few centimetres to many hundreds of kilometres. In addition, most of the world’s earthquakes occur within the Ring of Fire, a long horseshoe-shaped belt of earthquake epicentres, volcanoes, and tectonic plate boundaries fringing the Pacific basin. earthquake, any sudden shaking of the ground caused by the passage of seismic waves through Earth’s rocks. Seismic waves are produced when some form of energy stored in Earth’s crust is suddenly released, usually when masses of rock straining against one another suddenly fracture and “slip.” Earthquakes occur most often along geologic faults, narrow zones where rock masses move in relation to one another. The major fault lines of the world are located at the fringes of the huge tectonic plates that make up Earth’s crust. (See the table of major earthquakes.) Little was understood about earthquakes until the emergence of seismology at the beginning of the 20th century. Seismology, which involves the scientific study of all aspects of earthquakes, has yielded answers to such long-standing questions as why and how earthquakes occur. About 50,000 earthquakes large enough to be noticed without the aid of instruments occur annually over the entire Earth. Of these, approximately 100 are of sufficient size to produce substantial damage if their centres are near areas of habitation. Very great earthquakes occur on average about once per year. Over the centuries they have been responsible for millions of deaths and an incalculable amount of damage to property. Earth’s major earthquakes occur mainly in belts coinciding with the margins of tectonic plates. This has long been apparent from early catalogs of felt earthquakes and is even more readily discernible in modern seismicity maps, which show instrumentally determined epicentres. The most important earthquake belt is the Circum-Pacific Belt, which affects many populated coastal regions around the Pacific Ocean—for example, those of New Zealand, New Guinea, Japan, the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, and the western coasts of North and South America. It is estimated that 80 percent of the energy presently released in earthquakes comes from those whose epicentres are in this belt. The seismic activity is by no means uniform throughout the belt, and there are a number of branches at various points. Because at many places the Circum-Pacific Belt is associated with volcanic activity, it has been popularly dubbed the “Pacific Ring of Fire.” A second belt, known as the Alpide Belt, passes through the Mediterranean region eastward through Asia and joins the Circum-Pacific Belt in the East Indies. The energy released in earthquakes from this belt is about 15 percent of the world total. There also are striking connected belts of seismic activity, mainly along oceanic ridges—including those in the Arctic Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, and the western Indian Ocean—and along the rift valleys of East Africa. This global seismicity distribution is best understood in terms of its plate tectonic setting. Earthquakes are caused by the sudden release of energy within some limited region of the rocks of the Earth. The energy can be released by elastic strain, gravity, chemical reactions, or even the motion of massive bodies. Of all these the release of elastic strain is the most important cause, because this form of energy is the only kind that can be stored in sufficient quantity in the Earth to produce major disturbances. Earthquakes associated with this type of energy release are called tectonic earthquakes.",

                "content": "An earthquake is when Earth's tectonic plates shake and move Earth's surface. Strong earthquakes damage buildings. Disturbances in the Earth cause earthquakes. Different tectonic plates are slowly moving. When they get stuck, tension builds up in them. Earthquakes occur when tectonic plates suddenly break free, so they start moving quickly. The first point of an earthquake's rupture is called its hypocenter or focus. The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter. People who study earthquakes are called seismologists. Many earthquakes can occur in a small area in a short period of time. The sudden release of stress in the tectonic plates sends waves of energy that travel through the Earth. Seismology studies the cause, recurrence, type and magnitude of earthquakes. The effect of an earthquake can be measured with a seismometer. A seismometer detects the tremors of the earth and plots the tremors on a seismograph. The strength or magnitude of an earthquake can be measured using the Richter scale. The Richter scale was invented by Charles Francis Richter in 1935. The scale is numbered 0-10. A 2 on this scale is a tremor that is not easily recorded. And damage of size 5 (or more) in a wide area. The largest earthquake ever measured had a magnitude of 9.5. No one can tell when an earthquake will happen. But we know where earthquakes are likely to occur in the future, such as near fault lines. An earthquake under the ocean can create a huge wave called a tsunami. Tsunamis can also cause a lot of destruction. Earthquake zones are concentrated in some parts of the world. The first is the Pacific belt, which circles the Pacific Ocean. This part is the biggest seismic belt: it has the most active earthquakes and the most volcanoes.[1] The second part is the Alpide belt. It includes the seismic activities from Sumatra, to the Himalayas, to south Europe and north Africa, to the Atlantic Ocean. These belts are along the edges of tectonic plates. The tectonic plates push on each other and make great amounts of tension. Earthquakes sometimes hit cities and kill hundreds or thousands of people. Most earthquakes happen along the Pacific Ring of Fire but the biggest ones mostly happen in other places. Tectonically active places are places where earthquakes or volcanic eruptions are regularly repeated. Earthquakes are caused by tectonic movements in the Earth's crust. The main cause is when tectonic plates ride one over the other, causing orogeny (mountain building), and severe earthquakes.[2] The boundaries between moving plates form the largest fault surfaces on Earth. When they stick, motion between the plates leads to increasing stress. This continues until the stress rises and breaks, suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault. This releases the stored energy as shock waves. The San Andreas fault in San Francisco, and Rift valley fault in Africa are faults like this. Earthquakes caused by volcanic eruptions can be quite devastating. However, these earthquakes are confined to areas around active volcanoes. Often the causes are not known, except in the most general terms. An example is the largest earthquake in the history of the United States: the 1811–1812 New Madrid earthquakes. These are described as caused by very deep shifts in ancient rock formations. In other words, the cause is not known in detail. In areas of intense mining activity, often the roofs of underground mines collapse and minor tremors take place. These are called collapse earthquakes. There are three main types of geological fault that may cause an earthquake: normal, reverse (thrust) and strike-slip. Normal faults occur mainly in areas where the crust is being extended. Reverse faults occur in areas where the crust is being shortened. Strike-slip faults are steep structures where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other. Most earthquakes form part of a sequence, related to each other in terms of location and time.[3] Most earthquake clusters consist of small tremors which cause little to no damage, but there is a theory that earthquakes can recur in a regular pattern.[4] A foreshock is an earthquake that happens before a larger earthquake, called the mainshock. An aftershock is an earthquake that happens after a previous earthquake, the mainshock. An aftershock is in the same place of the main shock but always of a smaller magnitude. Aftershocks are formed as the crust adjusts to the effects of the main shock.[3] Earthquake swarms are sequences of earthquakes striking in a specific area within a short period of time. They are different from earthquakes followed by a series of aftershocks by the fact that no single earthquake in the sequence is obviously the main shock, therefore none have notably higher magnitudes than the other. An example of an earthquake swarm is the 2004 activity at Yellowstone National Park.[5] Sometimes a series of earthquakes happen in a sort of earthquake storm, where the earthquakes strike a fault in clusters, each triggered by the shaking or stress redistribution of the previous earthquakes. Similar to aftershocks but on adjacent segments of fault, these storms happen over the course of years, and with some of the later earthquakes as damaging as the early ones. Such a pattern happened in the North Anatolian fault in Turkey in the 20th century.[6][7] A tsunami is a chain of fast moving waves in the ocean caused by powerful earthquakes. They are very serious challenges for people's safety and for earthquake engineering. Those waves can flood coastal areas, destroy houses and even swipe away whole towns.[8] This is a danger for the whole mankind. Unfortunately, tsunamis cannot be prevented. However, there are warning systems[9] which may warn the population before the big waves reach the land to let them enough time to rush to safety. Earthquake-proof buildings are constructed to withstand the destructive force of an earthquake. This depends upon its type of construction, shape, mass distribution, and rigidity. Different combinations are used. Square, rectangular, and shell-shaped buildings can withstand earthquakes better than skyscrapers. To reduce stress, a building's ground floor can be supported by extremely rigid, empty columns, while the rest of the building is supported by flexible columns inside the empty columns. Another method is to use rollers or rubber pads to separate the base columns from the ground, allowing the columns to shake parallel to each other during an earthquake. To help prevent a roof from collapsing, builders make the roof out of light-weight materials. Outdoor walls are made with stronger and more reinforced materials such as steel or reinforced concrete. During an earthquake, flexible windows may help hold the windows together so they don't break.",

                "content": "Peter Morgan Alonso (born December 7, 1994), nicknamed \"Polar Bear\", is an American professional baseball first baseman who is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Mets. He made his MLB debut in 2019. Alonso played college baseball for the Florida Gators before the Mets selected him in the 2016 MLB draft. He made his MLB debut on Opening Day in 2019 and won the National League's Rookie of the Year award that year, setting a major league record for rookies with 53 home runs. Alonso is a four-time MLB All-Star that led the league in homers in 2019 and in RBI in 2022. He has also won the MLB Home Run Derby twice, in 2019 and 2021. Peter Morgan Alonso was born on December 7, 1994, in Tampa, Florida. His father, Peter Matthew Alonso, is the son of Spanish refugees who fled Barcelona during the Spanish Civil War and moved to Queens, a borough of New York City, but later settled in Lancaster, Ohio. His mother, Michelle Lynn Alonso (née Morgan), played college softball at Ohio Wesleyan University.[1][2] Alonso attended Jesuit High School in Tampa for his first two years of high school, and transferred to Henry B. Plant High School in Tampa to finish high school.[3][4] He played lacrosse and football as a freshman before deciding to focus solely on baseball.[5] For the baseball team, he was a third baseman.[6] Alonso enrolled at the University of Florida, where he played college baseball for the Florida Gators as a first baseman. He was named All-Southeastern Conference in his freshman year.[4] In 2014, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Madison Mallards of the Northwoods League,[7] and he was inducted into their Hall of Fame in 2024.[8][9] In the summer of 2015, he played for the Bourne Braves of the Cape Cod Baseball League.[10] In 2016, his junior year, he hit .374/.469/.659 with 14 home runs and 60 RBIs in 58 games.[11] He competed for Florida in the 2015 and 2016 College World Series.[12] The New York Mets selected Alonso in the second round, with the 64th pick overall, of the 2016 Major League Baseball draft.[6][13] He signed with the Mets for a $909,200 signing bonus,[14] and made his professional debut in 2016 with the Brooklyn Cyclones of the Class A-Short Season New York-Penn League. He posted a .322 batting average with five home runs and 21 RBIs in thirty games and was chosen to participate in the league's all-star game.[15] He began the 2017 season with the St. Lucie Mets of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League, and after batting .286 with 16 home runs and 58 RBIs in 82 games, was promoted to the Binghamton Rumble Ponies of the Class AA Eastern League in August,[16] where he batted .311 with two home runs and five RBIs in 11 games.[17] MLB.com ranked Alonso as New York's fourth-best prospect going into the 2018 season.[18] He began the 2018 season in Binghamton,[19] and received a midseason promotion to the Las Vegas 51s of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League. He represented the Mets in the 2018 All-Star Futures Game.[20] In 132 games between Binghamton and Las Vegas, he slashed .285/.395/.579 with 36 home runs and 119 RBIs.[21] He won the Joe Bauman Home Run Award.[22] That season, Alonso was the final batter in Cashman Field history, as he hit a walk-off home run in the bottom of the 9th inning during the last baseball game played at the facility.[23] Alonso made the Mets Opening Day roster in 2019 as the starting first baseman.[24] He was in the team's starting lineup on Opening Day on March 28, and recorded his first major league hit against Washington Nationals pitcher Justin Miller in the eighth inning.[25] First publicized on March 30, third-base coach Gary DiSarcina gave Alonso the endearing nickname \"Polar Bear\" for his power.[26] He hit his first major league home run on April 1 off of Drew Steckenrider of the Miami Marlins.[27] On April 9, Alonso had his first career multi-home run game against the Minnesota Twins.[28] Alonso became the first player in MLB history since 1900 with 11 extra-base hits in his first 10 career games. No other player ever had more than nine.[29] In April, Alonso batted .292 with nine home runs, eight doubles, one triple and 26 RBIs in his first games in the big leagues. He won the National League Rookie of the Month Award for April.[30] Alonso's nine home runs led all MLB rookies and are tied for the most by a Mets player before May 1 with Neil Walker (2016), John Buck (2013), Carlos Delgado (2006) and Dave Kingman (1976).[31] On June 22, Alonso hit his 26th home run, breaking the National League record for most home runs by a rookie before the All-Star break, passing Cody Bellinger. The next day, with his 27th home run, he broke the Mets rookie home run record, previously set by Darryl Strawberry in 1983.[32][33] Alonso was selected as a reserve to the 2019 All-Star Game.[34] He also won the National League Rookie of the Month Award for the month of June.[35] On July 7, Alonso became the second player in Mets history to hit the most home runs (30) before the All-Star break, after Dave Kingman (1976).[36] On July 8, Alonso won the 2019 MLB Home Run Derby, defeating Toronto Blue Jays third baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. 23–22 in the final round, becoming only the second rookie, after Aaron Judge, to win the Derby outright. On the way to the final round, Alonso also beat Carlos Santana and Ronald Acuña Jr., hitting 57 total home runs during the entire Derby.[37] On August 15, Alonso hit his 39th home run, tying Bellinger for the most home runs by a rookie in National League history. Alonso finished the game with a career-high five hits and six RBIs.[38] He broke Bellinger's record on August 18 with his 40th home run in an 11–5 win against the Kansas City Royals.[39] On August 27, Alonso hit his 42nd home run to become the Mets all-time single-season home run leader, surpassing Carlos Beltrán and Todd Hundley. He is the first rookie to set his franchise's single-season home run record since Johnny Rizzo did it for the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1938.[40] On September 27, Alonso hit his 52nd home run of the season, tying Aaron Judge for the most home runs by a rookie in MLB history.[41] He hit his 53rd the next day to break Judge's record.[42] His 53 home runs led all of Major League Baseball for the 2019 season. On November 11, Alonso was awarded the National League Rookie of the Year, receiving 29 of 30 first-place votes.[43][44] On December 10, Alonso was named to the first team of the inaugural All-MLB Team.[45] In the 2020 season shortened by COVID-19, Alonso played in 57 of the 60 games and batted .231/.326/.490 with 16 home runs and 35 RBIs.[46] On September 3, 2020, Alonso hit his first career walk-off home run.[47] Alonso's sophomore season was a step back from his breakout rookie year; Danny Abriano of Yahoo Sports called it \"a season to forget.\"[48] However, he had the highest maximum exit velocity of all major league hitters, at 118.4 miles per hour (190.5 km/h).[49] Alonso's sophomore slump coupled with a second consecutive breakout season from Dominic Smith led some talent evaluators to favor the latter as the team's starting first baseman heading into the 2021 season.[50] On July 12, Alonso won his second straight Home Run Derby after defeating Baltimore Orioles first baseman Trey Mancini 23–22 in the final round.[51] He became the third player ever to win back-to-back Home Run Derbys, as well as the fourth player to win two Home Run Derbys (after Ken Griffey Jr., Prince Fielder, and Yoenis Céspedes). Newsday Mets beat writer Tim Healey noted Alonso has earned $2 million from winning the Home Run Derby twice while making $1.47 million from 2019–2021 in base salary while playing for the Mets.[52] On September 7, Alonso hit his 100th career home run, off of Miami Marlins pitcher Edward Cabrera.

On March 22, 2022, Alonso signed a $7.4 million contract with the Mets, avoiding salary arbitration.[54] He hit his first career grand slam on April 9 against the Washington Nationals, off of pitcher Joan Adon.[55] On July 10, Alonso was named to the 2022 MLB All-Star Game, the second selection of his career,[56] He participated in the Home Run Derby, making it to the semifinals.[57] In a September 25 game against the Oakland Athletics, Alonso drove in five runs, setting a new Mets' single-season RBI record with 125.[58] He broke the record on a 451-foot (137 m) two-run home run in the fourth inning off of pitcher Norge Ruiz. The Mets previous RBI record was held by Mike Piazza (1999) and David Wright (2008).[59] On September 27 against the Miami Marlins, Alonso hit his 40th home run of the season, becoming the first Mets player to accomplish the feat twice.[60] In 2022, Alonso batted .271/.352/.518 with 40 home runs and 131 RBIs, breaking the franchise record and tying Aaron Judge for the most RBI in the major leagues.[61] Alonso and the Mets agreed to a $14.5 million salary for the 2023 season during the arbitration period.[62] On April 7, during a game against the Miami Marlins, Alonso hit his 150th career home run, passing Carlos Beltrán for sixth place on the Mets all-time home run list. He also became the second fastest player to 150 home runs (in 538 games) since Ryan Howard (495 games).[63] On June 7, Alonso was placed on the injured list when he suffered a bone bruise and left wrist sprain after being hit by a pitch.[64] He was expected to miss three to four weeks due to the injury, but recovered in just eleven days and was activated from the injured list on June 18.[65] On September 3, during a game against the Seattle Mariners, Alonso homered twice and drove in four runs, reaching 40-plus home runs and 100 RBIs for the second consecutive season. Alonso's two-run shot made him the fifth player in Major League history with at least three 40-home run seasons in his first five seasons of their career, joining Ralph Kiner (four seasons), Eddie Mathews, Ryan Howard, and Albert Pujols (each with 3 seasons).[66] On September 27, Alonso hit his 46th home run of the season in an 11–2 win over the Miami Marlins. His 192nd career homer made him tie Howard Johnson for 4th place on the Mets all-time home run list.[67][68] Alonso finished the 2023 season batting .217/.318/.504 with 46 home runs and 118 RBI.[69] The Mets and Alonso agreed on a one-year, $20.5 million contract to avoid salary arbitration on January 11, 2024.[70] On April 4, during a game against the Detroit Tigers, Alonso recorded his 500th career RBI on a game-tying home run off of pitcher Alex Faedo, becoming the 10th and fastest player in Mets history to achieve the milestone.[71][72] He then won NL Player of the Week honors on April 15.[73] On April 27 against the St. Louis Cardinals, Alonso hit his 200th career home run, off of pitcher Sonny Gray. He became the fourth-fastest player in MLB history to hit 200 home runs and the 4th Met to hit 200 career home runs.[74][75] On May 13, it was reported online that the Mets made an attempt to extend Alonso the previous season but they were unsuccessful, as he turned down a seven-year, $158 million contract extension from the team.[76] Alonso hit his 220th career home run on August 27 against the Arizona Diamondbacks, tying Mike Piazza for 3rd-place on the Mets all-time home run list.[77] Two days later, he would hit his 221st career homer, passing Piazza.[78][79] In 2024, Alonso appeared in 162 games for the Mets, making him the second player in Mets history to appear in every game in a single-season. He finished the season batting .240/.329/.459 with 34 home runs and 88 RBI.[80] On October 3, in Game 3 the 2024 National League Wild Card Series against the Milwaukee Brewers, with the Mets down 2–0 in the top of the 9th inning, Alonso hit a go-ahead, three-run home run to give the Mets a 3–2 lead. They would then go on to win 4–2 and eliminate the Brewers from the playoffs.[81] With that home run, Alonso became the first major league player in history to hit a go-ahead homer while trailing in the ninth inning or later of a winner-take-all postseason game.[82] In the 2024 MLB postseason, Alonso played in 13 games for the Mets, batting .273/.431/.568 with 4 home runs and 10 RBI.[83] After the 2024 season, Alonso's contract with the Mets expired and became a free agent for the first time in his career.[84] The Mets offered him a qualifying offer on November 2, which he declined on November 19.[85] On August 17, 2022, Alonso announced that he would also join the United States national baseball team in the 2023 World Baseball Classic.[86] Alonso went 2-for-14 across five games, most notably starting an eighth inning rally with a base hit against Venezuela in the quarterfinals, and later hitting an RBI single against Cuba in the semifinals.[87][88] Alonso first got his \"Polar Bear\" nickname when he was a top prospect. He made such a big impression during spring training in 2019 that Mets third baseman Todd Frazier, who was known for giving players nicknames, is the one who first coined it. Frazier said to Alonso, \"You look like a big, damn polar bear.\" \"And then it just kind of stuck,\" Alonso said during his rookie season.[89][90] Alonso married Haley Walsh on November 12, 2021, at Sacred Heart Catholic Church in downtown Tampa. She is originally from Boston; they met in the summer of 2015 while he was playing in the Cape Cod collegiate summer league. They carried on a long-distance relationship while he continued at the University of Florida and she attended Michigan State University. They were engaged in November 2018.[91][92] In 2020, the couple formed The Alonso Foundation, a charitable organization that supports youth, veteran, and animal causes.[93] On March 13, 2022, Alonso was involved in a car accident in Tampa, Florida, which he described as a \"really close experience to death.\" A driver ran a red light and struck Alonso's vehicle, which flipped over three times. Neither Alonso nor anyone else involved in the incident was injured.[94] An avid outdoorsman, he enjoys hunting and fishing. He was also featured in a season 9 episode of MeatEater in which he hunted mule deer in Colorado with Steven Rinella.[95]",

                "title": "Pete Alonso learning Spanish for Mets teammates",
                "content": "Anthony DiComo PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. -- A month after the Mets drafted him, in his debut for what was then Class A Short-Season Brooklyn, Pete Alonso experienced a bit of Minor League culture shock. Starting pitcher Harol González, a 21-year-old Spanish-speaking prospect, was in a jam. As the infield gathered around for a mound visit, Spanish-speaking catcher Ali Sánchez and English-speaking pitching coach Bill Bryk began trying to communicate with González. No one could follow the conversation. In what would become a regular occurrence in his life as a big leaguer, Alonso did his best to translate -- relatively unsuccessfully that day, but far more adequately in the months and years to come. Over his career, Alonso, who homered in the Mets' 8-4 win over the Marlins on Wednesday, has endeavored to achieve a level of fluency in Spanish, seeing it not only as an on-field skill but as a way to bond with teammates. He uses it regularly on first base and in the clubhouse, in situations both serious and casual. As Alonso puts it, “I don’t know if I can talk my way out of an arrest, but I’m pretty decent.” “I appreciate that he’s trying to find a way to interact with us,” said bilingual teammate Francisco Lindor. Alonso’s education began in childhood, during visits with his grandfather and great-aunt who emigrated from Spain in the 1930s. As they grew elderly, those two began losing the English skills they had picked up after coming to America, which forced Alonso to use more of his primitive Spanish to communicate with them. By the fourth grade, Alonso was learning formally at his Florida school, where students were not given the choice to learn French, Italian or Latin. Spanish, for its prominence in the general population, was a requirement. But it was not until Alonso’s years in the Minor Leagues that he “really started to get pretty decent.” Immersed in a clubhouse with players from the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and beyond, Alonso saw Spanish as a tool to learn about his teammates. Prospects from those countries typically take classes in English, but their American counterparts are not expected to reciprocate. As a result, cliques tend to form in the lower Minors. “The majority of these guys don’t know Spanish,” Alonso said, gesturing from one end of the room to the other, “and the majority of these guys don’t know English. How do you make that work?” Practice helps. Alonso hasn’t tried any language learning software in his free time, but his daily work environment features plenty of conversation partners -- more than one-third of those on the Mets’ spring roster are fluent in Spanish. He has used it to conduct interviews with Latino media outlets. On a recent vacation to Italy, Alonso tried communicating with both the Italian he learned in college as well as some Spanish, which is more widely understood than English in parts of that country. “When someone is trying to learn another language, it starts selfishly -- like you want to learn the other language, you want to expand your vocabulary,” Lindor said. “But it turns into a form of trying to bond with your teammates, trying to understand them.\" Other North American players have endeavored to learn Spanish over the years -- Cincinnati’s Joey Votto is one prominent example -- but such cases are relatively few and far between. Lindor could recall only one other Minor League teammate who took the time to do it with any level of thoroughness. Alonso is the exception. Even when talking to truly bilingual teammates such as Lindor, he doesn’t shy away from Spanish, despite the fact that he still struggles with complex sentences and conjugation. He credits some of the friendships he’s made in pro ball to his ability to speak the language or even just to his willingness to try. Younger players see it and appreciate the effort. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. “If you can help a few guys out here and there, I think it’s beneficial,” Alonso said. “Not only is it a language barrier, but it’s a huge cultural change where guys have to adjust to living in the United States. I think [speaking their language] helps a lot.” These days, however, English and Spanish are no longer the only tongues one can hear in the clubhouse. The Mets have a new player in Kodai Senga, who isn’t fluent in either. Challenge accepted, says Alonso: “Now, I’ve got to brush up on my Japanese.\"",

Phil Murphy over the mysterious drones that have been spotted flying overhead in recent weeks. Since mid-November, large drones of uncertain origin have been repeatedly spotted in the sky at night over central and northern New Jersey. The drones, which are larger than the type typically used by hobbyists, have raised concerns due to their proximity to both a military installation and President-elect Donald Trump's Bedminster golf course. In the letter, the mayors in Morris County called for a full investigation into the drones \"to determine the origin, purpose and compliance with applicable regulations.\" They also demanded the \"implementation of measures to prevent unauthorized or unsafe drone operations\" in Morris County going forward, and \"clear communication to local officials, law enforcement and residents regarding the findings of this investigation.\" \"While the benefits of drone technology are widely recognized when used responsibly and transparently, the lack of information and clarity regarding these operations has caused fear and frustration among our constituents,\" the mayors wrote. \"Despite inquiries made to relevant authorities, we have yet to receive satisfactory answers about the purpose, operators, or safety protocols governing these flights.\" The Federal Aviation Administration has imposed drone flight restrictions while authorities investigate. Local police previously said there is no known threat to public safety. \"Morris County Sheriff James M. Gannon would like to inform everyone that the recent drone activity observed by many in our communities is being actively investigated. There is no advisable immediate danger to the public at this time,\" the Morris County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. Last week, multiple Morris and Somerset county officials said in a joint statement they would continue to monitor the drone activity. \"County and local law enforcement agencies are aware of the recurring reports of drone activity around Morris and Somerset counties, and acknowledge the public's concern about these repeated sightings,\" they said. On Monday, a spokesperson for the FBI said the agency is \"doing all we can figure out what's going on.\" \"The public can continue to call our 800 line, or submit a tip online, we are acting on every substantive lead that we get,\" the FBI spokesperson said. In an interview on Fox News Monday, New York Rep. Nicole Malliotakis said members of the public \"deserve and demand answers\" about the drones. \"I've also reached out to FAA, to the Department of Homeland Security and to the FBI asking for answers, and they are aware of these aircrafts.

These sightings, which began in late November 2024, involve large, often car-sized drones flying in coordinated patterns, the New York Times reported. They have been spotted hovering over critical infrastructure, including reservoirs, power lines, and railroads, as well as flying over residential backyards, highways, and often in groups. A flurry of online images and videos have gone viral on social media in the US, sparking widespread curiosity and concern among locals. The drones were captured on camera by residents in multiple boroughs in the state, mostly at night. Witnesses described the drones as significantly larger than typical hobbyist models and emitting a loud, humming noise. \"It's kind of unsettling. They're not up for 15 minutes, they're up for hours,\" a resident told WPIX. \"We saw one right up above us that was the size of our car, another resident said. 🚨Additional Footage of Drone Sighting's in New Jersey: Not Planes – Light Patterns Deviate from FAA Guidelines‼️ Suggesting Tech-Based or UAP Mimicry#Uaphearing #UAP #uapdisclosure #UAPs #UAPTwitter #uapX #UFOTwitter #UFOSightings #ufodisclosure #njdrones #newjerseydrones pic.twitter.com/L9JeIQ4POy These \"drones\" being seen over New Jersey are Galactic Federation crafts.They're partially disguised to give those who aren't ready time to adapt.Some look like planes.

At the moment, we don't have any specifics to share,\" said bureau spokeswoman Amy J. Thoreson. Authorities have emphasised there is no immediate threat but encouraged residents to report sightings and provide images to assist the investigation. FBI's Newark office and Morris County officials issued a joint statement asking the public to come forward with any information they might have over the mysterious \"drone activity,\" including videos. \"There continues to be no known threat to public safety,\" the statement reads. However, the drones' consistent and organized activity has drawn public attention, with some fearing breaches of privacy or security. \"It is making people anxious. It's kind of like a Peeping Tom, and it gets everybody's vigilance up − they become hypervigilant to it,\" said Richard Waldron, a Closter-based psychologist. Following the reports, the Federal Aviation Administration has also banned drones from flying over President-elect Donald Trump's New Jersey golf course. Meanwhile, the mysterious drone sightings have captivated the online community, with the state's subreddit forum buzzing with theories and amateur investigations. Even UFO enthusiasts have joined the fray, speculating about the origins and purpose of the unmanned aerial vehicles. Theories abound, ranging from suspicions of foreign surveillance drones, such as the Chinese spy balloon incident last year, to possibilities of US military tests or local law enforcement surveillance.

Since mid-November, local residents in several counties in New Jersey have reported seeing clusters of drones – and in recent days, additional drone sightings have been reported in parts of Pennsylvania and New York’s Staten Island. Local residents in the regions have been capturing and sharing footage online that appears to show drones in the sky. Last week, the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Newark office announced it was actively investigating these sightings and was seeking information from the public. “Witnesses have spotted the cluster of what look to be drones and a possible fixed wing aircraft,” the FBI said. “We have reports from the public and law enforcement dating back several weeks.” While authorities investigate the reports, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has implemented temporary flight restrictions in the areas over Picatinny Arsenal military base and Trump National Golf Club Bedminster. The origin of the drones remains unknown. However, state leaders and elected officials have said that they are monitoring the sightings and have assured residents that the drones do not pose any immediate threat to the public. In a post on social media last week, Phil Murphy, New Jersey’s governor, said that he convened with officials from the Department of Homeland Security as well as local authorities and officials in New Jersey to discuss the reported drone activity. “We are actively monitoring the situation and in close coordination with our federal and law enforcement partners on this matter,” the governor said. He added: “There is no known threat to the public at this time.” Last week, an FBI spokesperson told local New Jersey outlet, NJ.com: “Unfortunately, we don’t have many answers, and we don’t want to guess or hypothesize about what’s going on.” “We are doing all we can to figure it out,” they added. On Monday, a group of 20 mayors in Morris county, New Jersey, reportedly wrote a letter to the state’s governor requesting a full investigation into the origin and purpose of the drones, according to CBS News, which obtained a copy of the letter. They also called for improved communication with residents and law enforcement, among other things.

In response to reports of drones over Staten Island’s airspace, the congresswoman Nicole Malliotakis said she asked the FAA to impose temporary drone flight restrictions in the area and had requested immediate briefings from the homeland security department and FBI. Two weeks ago, drones flying in New Jersey reportedly prevented a medical helicopter from picking up an injured individual after a car crash, according to USA Today. The police chief of Florham Park, New Jersey, Joseph Orlando, said in a statement on social media last week that several drone sightings had been reported above “critical infrastructure such as water reservoirs, electric transmission lines, rail stations, police departments and military installations. “Members of the local law enforcement community have been pressuring our partners for answers regarding this activity as their presence around our critical infrastructure is concerning,” the statement reads. “While we currently have no evidence or information to indicate these drones pose an imminent threat at this time, their presence appears nefarious in nature.” In the statement, authorities urged all residents to remain vigilant and report any drone sightings directly to the FBI.",

                "title": "More mysterious drones spotted over New Jersey's Bergen County",
                "content": "More mysterious drones were spotted “pacing back and forth” above New Jersey, new video shows — as government officials assured Garden State residents that there’s nothing to fear. The footage, captured by a New Jersey mom and shared on X, shows blinking lights buzzing over Bergen County on Sunday night. “They’re just pacing back and forth going very slow,” the mom said in the clip. “It doesn’t sound like a plane… no, no, it’s too quiet. That’s a drone,” she said, adding that she counted five or six flying machines hovering overhead. The spate of drone sightings across New Jersey has raised alarms among locals — who in recent weeks have filmed and posted countless videos of the unidentified aircraft to social media — and left local officials scratching their heads. But even as the sightings continue to confound authorities, Gov. Phil Murphy said residents need not worry — the drones pose “no known threat to the public at this time,” he wrote last week in a social media statement. “We are actively monitoring the situation and in close coordination with our federal and law enforcement partners on this matter,” he added. That provided little comfort to the frazzled residents of the Garden State, including Rachel Campos-Duffy, wife of Sean Duffy, President-elect Donald Trump’s next nominee for transportation secretary. “If you live in Morristown, Mendham, Summit, Bedminster, Far Hills — that whole area, that’s all you’re talking about,” she told Ainsley Earhardt on Fox & Friends on Monday, referencing a cluster of wealthy Morris County suburbs. “I think what you’re seeing is, first of all, no answers — whatever the governor put out was a non-answer, and it didn’t make me feel any better,” Campos-Duffy said. “And I don’t feel good — they’re flying low. They’re not up high like an airplane. They’re flying low, you can see them. And they’re large. They’re huge. These are not hobby drones.” “People are outraged,” she added. “Three weeks, no answers.” The feds have said they are looking into the mysterious sightings that began on Nov. 18, when cops first responded to calls about them hovering over Morris County. Since then, drones have appeared in the night over homes, neighborhoods and military installations across the state. “Unfortunately, we don’t have many answers, and we don’t want to guess or hypothesize about what’s going on,” FBI spokeswoman Amy J. Thoreson told NJ.com on Wednesday. “We are doing all we can to figure it out.” Meanwhile, conspiracy theorists are doing their best to fill in the gaps. Some say criminals are using the drones to case houses for future robberies, while others say they might be the eyes and ears of terrorists lurking in our midst, according to NJ.com. Still others say the Chinese or other hostile foreign nations are controlling the devices — while some go off the deep end completely and claim aliens have engineered the whole thing. Although cops haven’t commented on the slew of silliness, Pramod Abichandani, a professor who directs the Advanced Air Mobility Lab at New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark, told the outlet those explanations are unlikely. If the drones had a nefarious purpose, he said, they probably wouldn’t be so loud and visible. “It would be extremely careless on the part of people who are working for foreign powers to just expose themselves like that,” Abichandani said, adding that the machines probably belong to commercial or US military operators. “It takes an incredible amount of competence to do something nefarious with drones.” There have already been real-world consequences for the mechanical joyrides — such as when one of the drones disrupted a medevac helicopter set to airlift a patient. The scores of sightings also led the Federal Aviation Administration to restrict drone flights over Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County and the Trump National Golf Club in Somerset. “It’s a complete mystery,” Mark Chiarolanza, spokesman for the Morris County Sheriff’s Office, told NJ.com. “The best way we’re going to figure this out is if somebody can get a good, solid picture of these things,” he said, adding that some of the drones’ large size indicates a recreational group isn’t behind this. “We can’t knock these things out of the sky,” he continued. Meanwhile, more drones were spotted above Staten Island Thursday, prompting politicians to urge the feds to figure out their origin, according to the Staten Island Advance. People have seen them in eight counties since they were first spotted — from Bergen in the east to Hunterdon in the west, and near the Pennsylvania border — according to the Bergen Record.

                "title": "Dave Parker - Wikipedia",
                "content": "David Gene Parker (born June 9, 1951), nicknamed \"the Cobra\",[1] is an American former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a right fielder from 1973 to 1991. A seven-time All-Star, Parker won two National League batting titles and was the 1978 National League Most Valuable Player. He was a member of two World Series championship teams, winning with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1979 and the Oakland Athletics in 1989. Parker was the second professional athlete to earn an average of $1 million per year, having signed a five-year, $5 million contract in January 1979. Parker's career achievements include 2,712 hits, 339 home runs, 1,493 runs batted in and a lifetime batting average of .290. Parker was also known as a solid defensive outfielder during the first half of his career with a powerful arm, winning three straight Gold Gloves during his prime. From 1975 to 1979, he threw out 72 runners, including 26 in 1977. In 2025, Parker will be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.[2] Parker grew up in Cincinnati near Crosley Field, where he learned to play baseball on the stadium's parking lots. His father, Dick Parker, was a shipping clerk in a foundry.[3] Dave Parker attended Courter Tech High School. He has said his favorite sport was football, and he starred at tailback but injured a knee in a game during his senior year and gave up the game. Also a baseball star, one of his fondest memories is playing at Western Hills High School (alma mater of Pete Rose), where he hit a home run that landed on the roof of a Frisch's restaurant.[4] In 1973, as a member of the Pirates Triple–A minor league affiliate, the Charleston Charlies, legend has it that Parker hit a home run that landed on a coal car on a passing train and the ball was later picked up in Columbus, Ohio.[5] However, in a 1975 interview, Parker stated, \"When I played for Charleston I always had the ambition to hit a home run onto a moving train. I really used to shoot for that. I hit a few on the tracks, but never as a train was going by.\"[6] He began his major league career on July 12, 1973, with the Pittsburgh Pirates, for whom he played from 1973 to 1983. His first full season came in 1975, when he led the National League in slugging percentage (.541) and finished third in NL MVP voting. In 1977, he was National League batting champion, a feat he repeated in 1978 when he was named the National League MVP. This was in spite of a collision at home plate with John Stearns during a game against the Mets on June 30, 1978, in which Parker fractured his jaw and cheekbone; he wore a specially constructed facemask in order to minimize his time away from the lineup.[7] The Pirates rewarded him with baseball's first million-dollar-per-year contract.[8][9] The following year, he was an instrumental part of the Pirates' World Series championship team.[10] During a game in 1979, a powerful hit he made to right field was very difficult to throw into the infield, because he had \"knocked the cover off the ball.\" One of the seams on the ball ruptured, making nearly half of the cover come loose.[11] Pirate fans angered by his million-dollar contract threw \"nuts and bolts and bullets and batteries\" at him, as pitcher Kent Tekulve stated. A typo in a news story made it appear they threw car batteries.[12] In 1981 at a point in his career when it looked as if he would one day rank among the game's all-time greats, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time.[13] The authors, noting that Parker had succeeded Roberto Clemente at the position, wrote, \"Someone must have a fondness for right field in Pittsburgh.\" Parker took after his Pirates teammate Willie Stargell in warming up in the on-deck circle with a sledgehammer (when most batters would use a simple lead-weighted bat).[14] In the early 1980s, however, Parker's hitting suffered due to injuries, weight problems and his increasing cocaine use.[15] He became one of the central figures in a drug scandal that spread through the major leagues. At the end of the 1983 season, Parker became a free agent and signed with the Cincinnati Reds. In Cincinnati, his hometown, he returned to the form that made him an All-Star in Pittsburgh.[12] In 1985, he enjoyed his best season since he won the 1978 MVP with a .312 batting average and 34 home runs; he also led the National League with 125 RBIs, 42 doubles, 80 extra-base hits and 350 total bases. Parker finished second in 1985 MVP voting to Willie McGee. Parker was also the winner of the league's first-ever Home Run Derby in 1985. Following the season, Parker was among several players who testified against a dealer in the Pittsburgh drug trials. Named as \"regular users\", Parker and six other players were suspended for the following season. The sentences were commuted, however, in exchange for donating ten percent of their base salaries to drug-related community service, submitting to random drug testing, and contributing 100 hours of drug-related community service.[16][17] After the 1987 season, Cincinnati traded Parker to the Oakland Athletics for José Rijo and Tim Birtsas. In Oakland, Parker was able to extend his career by spending most of his time as a designated hitter. Although injuries and age caught up to him to a degree – he hit just .257 with 12 homers in 377 at-bats in 1988 and .264 with 22 homers in 553 at-bats in 1989 – his veteran leadership was a significant factor in the A's consecutive World Series appearances which included another World Series title for Parker 1989, exactly 10 years after his first one with the Pirates in '79. Parker signed with the Milwaukee Brewers for the 1990 season and had a solid year as the Brewers' DH with a .289 average and 21 home runs in 610 at-bats. He was even selected as a reserve for the 1990 All-Star Game. Milwaukee opted for youth however, at the end of the year and traded the aging Parker to the Angels for Dante Bichette. Parker's last season was 1991. He played for the California Angels until late in the season before being released. The Toronto Blue Jays then signed him as insurance for the pennant race, and Parker hit .333 in limited action. Since he was acquired too late in the season, he did not qualify for inclusion on the post-season roster and was unable to play in the American League Championship Series against the Minnesota Twins, which the Blue Jays lost in five games. Parker retired at end of the season. Source:[1][2] In 30 postseason games, Parker batted .234 (26-for-111) with 11 runs, 5 doubles, 3 home runs, 11 RBI and 7 walks. Parker has served as a first-base coach for the Anaheim Angels, a batting coach for the St. Louis Cardinals in 1998, and a special hitting instructor for Pittsburgh. He owned several Popeyes Chicken franchises in Cincinnati[18] until selling his interest in them in 2012 after 25 years.[19] Parker never got more than 24% of votes on Baseball Hall of Fame ballots, and his 15-year Baseball Writers' Association of America eligibility was exhausted on the 2011 ballot. Supporters of Parker's candidacy argue that his involvement with the Pittsburgh drug trials has contributed to his not being voted into the Hall of Fame, which may have also harmed the candidacies of Keith Hernandez (who never received more than 10.8% and fell off the writers' ballot on his ninth try) and Tim Raines (debuted at 24.3%, but was elected on his tenth year on the ballot), serving as a precursor to those listed on the Mitchell Report not being voted into the Hall of Fame due to steroid abuse.[20][21] Parker appeared on the Classic Baseball Era Committee's 2025 ballot and was elected with 87.5% of the vote on December 8, 2024. He will be formally inducted on July 27, 2025.[22][2] Parker has had both of his knees replaced due to injuries from his playing career.[23] In 2013, he confirmed to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.[24] He is involved in raising money to find a cure for Parkinson's disease through the Dave Parker 39 Foundation.[25] Parker has six children. He currently resides in Loveland, Ohio, near Cincinnati, with his wife, Kellye.[4][19] Parker was elected to the Reds Hall of Fame Class of 2014, which also included fellow Cincinnati natives Ron Oester and Ken Griffey Jr.[26] In 2012, he was inducted into the Cincinnati Public Schools Athletic Hall of Fame.[4] On September 3, 2022, he was inducted into the Pittsburgh Pirates Hall of Fame as part of its inaugural class.",

                "content": "West Ham United's Jarrod Bowen struck midway through the second half to secure a deserved 2-1 Premier League home win on Monday over Wolverhampton Wanderers, whose poor defending cost them again as they languish second-bottom in the standings. Wolves conceded three minutes after equalising to stay in 19th spot on nine points from 15 games, while West Ham are 14th with 18 points. The 38 goals Wolves have conceded is the highest total in the top flight this season. The game featured a minute's applause after the ninth minute for 34-year-old Hammers striker Michail Antonio, who is recovering in hospital following surgery on a fractured leg sustained in a car crash on Saturday. With both managers -- West Ham's Julen Lopetegui and Wolves' Gary O'Neil -- struggling to turn things around after their teams' disappointing starts to the season, the pre-match talk was all about whose job was most at risk. After forcing a slew of set pieces in a scoreless first half, it was Lopetegui's Hammers who broke the deadlock in the 54th minute through Tomás Soucek from their 10th corner. The Wolves defence left the Czech midfielder unmarked at the far post to send a looping header across goal into the net. The goal was the eighth Wolves have conceded from a corner and the 15th from a set piece excluding penalties this season, more than any other top flight team. Wolves managed to level through Matt Doherty in the 69th minute with a superbly taken scooped volley into the corner shortly after they had a strong penalty appeal turned town. The lead was short-lived asWolves' defensive frailties were exposed again, with Bowen jinking onto his left foot in the box before burying the ball in the corner three minutes later. Deflated after conceding so soon following their equaliser, Wolves struggled to create any momentum and, a few harmless off-target shots aside, they barely threatened the West Ham goal in the final minutes as the hosts held on comfortably to win. Soucek revealed after the game that the team had spoken to Antonio on a video call earlier on Monday. \"The goal was for him. I dedicated it to him. I said before the game I really wanted to score even more today. He's been here since I came here. He's really my favourite,\" he told Sky Sports, adding he could not wait to visit his recovering teammate. Wolves coach O'Neil admitted he was under pressure, but insisted that his team were still giving it their all. \"I'm bit disappointed for them, really, because it was a decent away performance under a lot of pressure,\" he told Sky Sports. \"I can only ask them to give what they give, and they're giving absolutely everything, so I hope the supporters are still proud of what they see from the players.\"",

                "title": "Minnesota Timberwolves - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Minnesota Timberwolves (often referred to as the Wolves) are an American professional basketball team based in Minneapolis. The Timberwolves compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Northwest Division of the Western Conference.[8] The team was founded in 1989. Its majority owner is Glen Taylor, who also owns the WNBA's Minnesota Lynx.[9] Currently, Taylor is in a legal battle over ownership of the team with Alex Rodriguez, Marc Lore, and Michael Bloomberg.[10] The Timberwolves play their home games at Target Center, their home since 1990.[11] Like most expansion teams, the Timberwolves struggled in their early years, but after the acquisition of Kevin Garnett in the 1995 NBA draft, the team qualified for the playoffs in eight consecutive seasons from 1997 to 2004. Despite losing in the first round in their first seven attempts, the Timberwolves won their first division championship in 2004 and advanced to the Western Conference finals that same season. Garnett was also named the NBA Most Valuable Player for that season.[12] The team then went into rebuilding mode for more than a decade after missing the postseason in 2005, and trading Garnett to the Boston Celtics in 2007.[13] Garnett returned to the Timberwolves in a February 2015 trade and finished his career there, retiring in the 2016 off-season. The Timberwolves ended a 14-year playoff drought when they returned to the postseason in 2018. NBA basketball returned to the Twin Cities in 1989 for the first time since the Minneapolis Lakers (1947–1960) departed to Los Angeles in 1960. The NBA had granted one of its four new expansion teams on April 22, 1987 (the others being the Orlando Magic, Charlotte Hornets, and the Miami Heat) to original owners Harvey Ratner and Marv Wolfenson to begin play beginning in the 1989–90 season. There were two previous American Basketball Association (ABA) franchises that played in between the Lakers' departure and the Timberwolves arrival: the Minnesota Muskies (1967–68), and the Minnesota Pipers (1968–69). The Timberwolves have worn throwback uniforms for each of the previous franchises.[14][15] The franchise conducted a \"name the team\" contest[16] and eventually selected two finalists, \"Timberwolves\" and \"Polars\", in December 1986. The team then asked the 842 city councils in Minnesota to select the winner and \"Timberwolves\" prevailed by nearly 2–1.[17][18] The team was officially named the \"Minnesota Timberwolves\" on January 23, 1987. Minnesota is home to the largest population of timberwolves in the contiguous 48 states.[19] The Timberwolves debuted on November 3, 1989, losing to the Seattle SuperSonics on the road 106–94. Five days later, they made their home debut at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, losing to the Chicago Bulls 96–84. Two nights later on November 10, the Wolves got their first win, beating the Philadelphia 76ers at home 125–118. The Timberwolves, led by Tony Campbell with 23.2 ppg, went on to a 22–60 record, finishing in sixth place in the Midwest Division. Playing in the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, the expansion Timberwolves set an NBA record by drawing over 1 million fans to their home games.[20] This included a crowd of 49,551 on April 17, 1990, which saw the Timberwolves lose to the Denver Nuggets 99–88 in the final home game of the season.[21] The next season, the team moved into their permanent home, the Target Center, and improved somewhat, finishing 29–53. However, they fired their head coach, Bill Musselman. They fared far worse in the 1991–92 NBA season under Musselman's successor, ex-Celtics coach Jimmy Rodgers, finishing with an NBA-worst 15–67 record. Looking to turn the corner, the Wolves hired former Detroit Pistons general manager Jack McCloskey to the same position, but even with notable first-round selections such as Christian Laettner and Isaiah Rider, the Timberwolves were unable to duplicate McCloskey's \"Detroit Bad Boys\" success in the Twin Cities, finishing 19–63 and 20–62 the next two seasons. One of the few highlights from that era was when the Target Center served as host of the 1994 All-Star Game where Rider won the Slam Dunk Contest with his between-the-leg \"East Bay Funk Dunk\".[22] As winning basketball continued to elude the Wolves, Ratner and Wolfenson nearly sold the team to New Orleans interests in 1994 before NBA owners rejected the proposed move. Eventually, Glen Taylor bought the team and named Kevin McHale general manager. The Wolves finished 21–61 in 1994–95, and the future looked bleak.[23] In the 1995 NBA draft, the Timberwolves selected high school standout Kevin Garnett in the first round (5th overall),[24] and Flip Saunders was named head coach. Christian Laettner was traded along with Sean Rooks to the Atlanta Hawks for Andrew Lang and Spud Webb. Also, first-round pick Donyell Marshall was traded the previous season for Golden State Warriors' forward Tom Gugliotta. These trades paved the way for rookie Kevin Garnett to become the go-to player inside. Garnett went on to average 10.4 ppg in his rookie season as the Wolves finished in 5th place in the Midwest Division, with a 26–56 record.[23] In 1996, the Wolves added another star player in the draft, trading Ray Allen to the Milwaukee Bucks for the rights to Stephon Marbury, the 4th overall pick. The addition of Marbury had a positive effect on the entire team, as Garnett and Gugliotta became the first Wolves to be selected to the All-Star team. Gugliotta and Garnett led the Timberwolves in scoring as the team made the playoffs for the first time in franchise history with a record of 40–42. However, in the playoffs the Timberwolves made a quick exit as they were swept by the Houston Rockets in three straight games.[25] The T-Wolves also decided to change their image by changing their team logo and color scheme, adding black to the team colors and replacing the original logo with one featuring a snarling wolf looming over a field of trees. It was also during this season that Minnesota began to play on a parquet floor. In 1997, Garnett and Marbury established themselves as two of the brightest rising stars in the NBA. Garnett averaged 18.5 ppg and 9.6 rebounds per game, while Marbury averaged 17.7 ppg and dished out 8.6 assists per game. Despite losing leading scorer Tom Gugliotta for half the season, the Timberwolves went on to post their first winning season at 45–37, making the playoffs for the second straight season. After dropping Game 1 of the playoffs on the road to the Seattle SuperSonics, the Timberwolves won their first postseason game in Game 2, winning in Seattle 98–93. As the series shifted to Minnesota, the Timberwolves had an opportunity to pull off the upset as they won Game 3 by a score of 98–90. However, the Wolves dropped Game 4 at home as the Sonics went on to win the series in five games.[26] In 1998, a year after signing Kevin Garnett to a six-year, $126 million contract, the Timberwolves were then used as the poster child of irresponsible spending as the NBA endured a four-month lockout that wiped out much of the season. With an already cap-heavy payroll, the Wolves let Tom Gugliotta walk, partially because the team wanted to save money in order to sign Stephon Marbury to a long-term contract, and in part because Gugliotta did not want to play with the young player. This move proved unsuccessful, however, as Stephon Marbury wanted to be the biggest star on a team and subsequently forced an in-season trade by refusing a contract extension. In the three-team mid-season deal that sent Marbury to the New Jersey Nets, the Wolves got Terrell Brandon in return and a first-round draft pick in the 1999 draft (which turned out to be the sixth pick). The Wolves made the playoffs for the third straight season by finishing in fourth place with a 25–25 record. In the playoffs, the Timberwolves were beaten by the eventual champion San Antonio Spurs in four games.[27] In 1999, the Timberwolves drafted Wally Szczerbiak with the sixth pick in the draft.[28] He had a solid season, finishing third on the team in scoring with 11.6 points per game. Led by Kevin Garnett, who averaged 22.9 points per game and 11.8 rebounds per game, the Timberwolves had their first 50-win season and finished in 3rd place with a record of 50–32. However, in the playoffs the Wolves again fell in the first round, losing to the Portland Trail Blazers in four games.[29] The Wolves opened the 1999–2000 regular season with two home games against the Sacramento Kings at the Tokyo Dome on November 6 and 7. In the summer of 2000, guard Malik Sealy was killed in a car accident by a drunk driver. Sealy's number has since been retired: the number 2 jersey memorialized with Sealy's name on a banner hanging from the rafters of Target Center. It remains the only number retired by the team.[30] Also in that season, a free agent deal signed by Joe Smith was voided by the NBA, who ruled that the Timberwolves violated proper procedure in signing the contract. The league stripped the Timberwolves of five draft picks (first round 2001–2005), but it was eventually reduced to three first-round picks (2001, 2002, and 2004). The league also fined the Timberwolves $3.5 million and suspended general manager Kevin McHale for one year. Smith eventually signed with the Detroit Pistons before re-signing with the Timberwolves in 2001. Despite those setbacks, the Timberwolves made the playoffs for the fifth straight season with a 47–35 record.[31] In the playoffs, the Timberwolves were eliminated in the first round again by the San Antonio Spurs in four games in the spring of 2001.[32] A number of newcomers arrived prior to the start of the next season, including Gary Trent, Loren Woods and Maurice Evans and the return of Joe Smith. The Timberwolves started the season by winning their first six games and went on to achieve a franchise-best start of 30–10. The Timberwolves had a franchise-record 53-point win over Chicago in November. They finished with a 50–32 record: their second-ever 50-win season that was highlighted by another All-Star appearance by Garnett and a breakout season by Wally Szczerbiak, who earned his first All-Star appearance. Once again, Minnesota lost in the first round of the playoffs, where they were swept by the Dallas Mavericks in three straight games.[33] The 2002–03 season seemed to look up for the Timberwolves. Garnett had a great season where he finished second in MVP voting with 23.0 points per game and 13.4 rebounds per game and the Timberwolves finished in third place with a 51–31 record. As a result, they were awarded home-court advantage for the first time when facing the three-time defending champion Los Angeles Lakers. After losing at home in Game 1, the Timberwolves had a chance to take a 3–1 series lead heading into the 4th quarter of Game 4 in Los Angeles, but the Lakers came back to win the game and eventually won the series in six games. In the end, the Timberwolves were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs for the seventh straight year.[34] In 2003, Rob Babcock was promoted to vice-president of player personnel. He and general manager Kevin McHale made a series of strong off-season moves in an attempt to get the team over the hump and beyond the first round of the playoffs. They made two important trades, sending away forward Joe Smith and guard Terrell Brandon in a multi-player deal for Ervin Johnson, Sam Cassell and embattled guard Latrell Sprewell. They also signed sharp-shooter Fred Hoiberg, and former first overall pick Michael Olowokandi as free agents, with both becoming key contributors during the season. The Timberwolves rounded out their bench by signing veteran role players Trenton Hassell, Troy Hudson, and Mark Madsen. Despite injuries to a revitalized Olowokandi (who missed half the season) and 6th man Wally Szczerbiak (who only played in 28 games), the revamped Timberwolves became the team to beat during the 2003–04 NBA season, finishing the season as the top seed in the Western Conference with a record of 58–24. Garnett had his best season to date, and both Sprewell and Cassell had career years as well. Garnett and Cassell both made the all-star team, and after the season, Garnett was named 1st Team All NBA, and earned his first MVP award averaging 24.2 points, 13.9 rebounds and 5.0 assists per game.[35] During the 2004 NBA playoffs, the Wolves won their first-ever playoff series against the Denver Nuggets, before beating the Sacramento Kings in a hard-fought seven-game series to advance to the franchise's first Western Conference finals. Kevin Garnett leapt upon the scorer's table upon the winning Game 7 in the Sacramento series, which became one of the more iconic moments in Minnesota sports history. The Timberwolves' run ended in the Western Conference finals as the team lost to the Los Angeles Lakers. Sam Cassell injured his groin during Game 7 against the Kings, doing his infamous big balls dance after knocking down the series-clinching bucket, and as a result, played only sparingly during the Lakers series. Many around the NBA, including both Flip Saunders and Phil Jackson believe that had he been healthy, the Wolves would have advanced to the finals.[36][37] Going into the 2004–05 season, the Wolves roster remained virtually the same from the previous season; however, Babcock left to become the general manager of the Toronto Raptors, and the team was also plagued with contract disputes and the complaining of key players Latrell Sprewell, Sam Cassell, and Troy Hudson during the off-season. After a disappointing start to the season, head coach Flip Saunders was replaced by general manager and long-time friend Kevin McHale, who took over as coach for the rest of the season. Despite a strong finish, the Timberwolves missed the playoffs for the first time in eight years, by one game, to the Memphis Grizzlies, ending the season with a record of 44–38. During the 2005 off-season, McHale and the Wolves started their search for a head coach. McHale interviewed Seattle SuperSonics assistant coach Dwane Casey, San Antonio Spurs assistant P. J. Carlesimo, former coach John Lucas and Wolves assistants Randy Wittman, Sidney Lowe and Jerry Sichting, among others. On June 17, 2005, the Timberwolves hired Casey as the new head coach. It was Casey's first head coaching job, making him the Wolves' seventh head coach in their 16-year history.[38] In the 2005 draft, the Timberwolves selected Rashad McCants, a shooting guard from North Carolina with the 14th overall pick of the first round.[39] The Timberwolves also selected Bracey Wright, a guard from Indiana, with the 17th pick of the second round (47th overall).[40] During the off-season, they traded All-Star Sam Cassell and a protected future first-round draft pick to the Los Angeles Clippers for Marko Jarić and Lionel Chalmers. They also signed free agent Nikoloz Tskitishvili.[41] On January 26, 2006, the Wolves traded forward Wally Szczerbiak, centers Dwayne Jones and Michael Olowokandi, and a future first-round draft pick to the Boston Celtics. In return, they received forward-guard Ricky Davis, center Mark Blount, forward Justin Reed, guard Marcus Banks, and two second-round draft picks. In a separate trade on the same day, the Timberwolves traded Tskitishvili to the Phoenix Suns for a 2006 second-round draft pick. The Timberwolves finished 33–49, missing the playoffs for the second consecutive year.[42] In the 2006 NBA draft, the Timberwolves selected future NBA Rookie of the Year Brandon Roy with the 6th overall pick, Craig Smith with the 36th pick, forward Bobby Jones with the 37th pick and center Loukas Mavrokefalidis with the 57th pick. The Timberwolves traded Roy to the Portland Trail Blazers for Randy Foye and cash considerations. The Timberwolves then traded Bobby Jones to the Philadelphia 76ers for a 2007 second-round pick and cash. On January 23, McHale fired head coach Casey and replaced him with Randy Wittman. McHale explained in a news conference that it was inconsistency by Casey that led to the firing. Casey had compiled an overall record of 53–69. They finished the 2006–07 season with a record of 32–50, allowing them to keep their 2007 first-round pick.[43] On July 31, 2007, the Minnesota Timberwolves reached a deal to trade All-Star Kevin Garnett to the Boston Celtics for Al Jefferson, Theo Ratliff, Gerald Green, Sebastian Telfair, Ryan Gomes, two first-round draft picks, and cash considerations. This is the largest combination of players and picks ever traded for a single player in NBA history.[44][45] Garnett and the Celtics went on to win the 2008 NBA Finals in six games over the Los Angeles Lakers. That summer, the Timberwolves traded Mike James and Justin Reed to the Houston Rockets for Juwan Howard.[46] In October of the same year, the Timberwolves waived Howard after reaching a contractual buyout agreement, worth $10 million of roughly $14.25 million which Minnesota would have owed him. The team also traded Ricky Davis and Mark Blount to the Miami Heat in exchange for the Heat's Antoine Walker, Michael Doleac, Wayne Simien, and a 2008 protected first-round draft pick. In the 2007 NBA draft the Timberwolves selected Corey Brewer, with the 7th pick, and Chris Richard with the 41st overall pick, both being from the two-time NCAA national champion Florida Gators.[47] Minnesota began the NBA preseason with two games in London and Istanbul, as part of NBA Europe Live 2007. On October 10, The Wolves lost to Garnett and the revamped Celtics, 92–81. To start the season, the Wolves began 0–5 before ending the drought with a home win over the Sacramento Kings. That drought also brought about speculation of the possible dismissal of coach Wittman. The youngest team in the NBA began adjusting to life after trading franchise star Garnett to Boston, meanwhile playing without budding talent Randy Foye for the first half of the season. Guards Sebastian Telfair and Marko Jarić were deputized as starting point guards during Foye's injury absence. The Timberwolves finished the season 22–60.[48] On a handful of occasions during the season, the team showed flashes of its potential in wins or very close contests with top-tier teams. In the 2008 NBA draft, the Timberwolves selected O. J. Mayo of USC with the third overall pick. When the draft concluded, the Timberwolves traded Mayo, Antoine Walker, Greg Buckner, and Marko Jarić to the Memphis Grizzlies in exchange for fifth overall pick Kevin Love, Mike Miller, Jason Collins, and Brian Cardinal in a move that Jim Stack called, \"a deal we couldn't pass up.\"[49] In 2008, in celebration of the franchise's 20th anniversary, the team unveiled an updated version of its logo and uniforms.[50] The new designs first appeared in the first preseason game against the Chicago Bulls at United Center on October 14, 2008. They also refurbished the floor at Target Center, returning to the traditional floor pattern and added touches of varnish while exposing most of the hardwood. On December 8, 2008, after a 23-point loss to the Los Angeles Clippers that dropped the team to 4–15, the Timberwolves fired head coach Wittman and McHale took over. McHale also relinquished his vice president of basketball operations duties. It was unclear whether McHale's future with the team was dependent on the success or progress of the team which he had put together over the previous four years. Those questions seemed to be answered when the Timberwolves went 10–4 for the month of January, giving McHale the coach of the month honors. But on February 8, 2009, the team's main star Al Jefferson tore his ACL in his right knee in a game at New Orleans, sidelining him for the rest of the season. At the time of the injury, Jefferson was having his best season to date, averaging 23 points, 11 rebounds and 2 blocks.[51] Without Jefferson and Corey Brewer (who also suffered a season-ending injury), the Wolves sputtered, to finish with a 24–58 record.[52] On June 17, 2009, new president of basketball operations David Kahn announced that McHale would not be returning to the team as head coach. Kahn did not give a specific reason for McHale's dismissal, only saying \"this is going to be a transition period.\" For his part, McHale said he wanted to come back but was not offered a contract. Later, in August, the Timberwolves announced the signing of Kurt Rambis, then an assistant for the Los Angeles Lakers, to a four-year, $8 million contract to be their new head coach. In Rambis's first season, the team stumbled to the second-worst record in the league, as their 15–67 record was only surpassed by that of the New Jersey Nets, who finished at 12–70.[53] On July 12, 2010, Minnesota traded for Miami Heat forward Michael Beasley, the second pick from the 2008 NBA draft.[54] In a locally untelevised game on November 12, 2010, Kevin Love grabbed a franchise-record 31 rebounds and scored 31 points in a win over the New York Knicks, the NBA's first 30–30 game in 28 years.[55] Love was later named an All Star for the 2010–11 NBA season, the franchise's first All Star selection since Kevin Garnett in 2007. Love would later break Garnett's team record of 37 straight double-doubles on February 8, 2011, in a win over the Houston Rockets. On March 8, 2011, Love acquired his 52nd straight double-double, surpassing the mark of Moses Malone for the most consecutive double-doubles since the NBA-ABA merger in a win over the Indiana Pacers. The streak eventually reached 53 games and came to an end with a six-point, 12-rebound performance in a 100–77 loss to the Golden State Warriors on March 13. In October 2011, Love was ranked 16th among active players by ESPN.[56] On February 21, 2011, Corey Brewer and Kosta Koufos were traded to the New York Knicks and Denver Nuggets respectively for Knicks Anthony Randolph and Eddy Curry (plus $3 million in cash from New York and a 2015 second-round draft pick from Denver) as part of a larger trade that sent all-star Carmelo Anthony from Denver to New York.[57] On the downside, with a 121–102 loss to the Houston Rockets, the Timberwolves fell to 17–65, finishing last in the Western Conference for the second straight year. They also clinched the 2010–11 NBA season's worst record. During the off-season, the Timberwolves were finally able to bring 2009 fifth overall pick Ricky Rubio over from Spain. In the 2011 NBA draft, with the second overall pick, the Timberwolves selected Derrick Williams of Arizona. The Timberwolves then traded guard Jonny Flynn and the draft rights to Donatas Motiejūnas (No. 20) to the Houston Rockets for center Brad Miller, the draft rights to Nikola Mirotić (No. 23), Chandler Parsons (No. 38) and a future first-round pick. The Timberwolves traded Mirotic's rights to the Chicago Bulls for the rights to Norris Cole (No. 28) and Malcolm Lee (No. 43). The Timberwolves then sold the rights to Parsons back to the Rockets. The Timberwolves traded Norris Cole (No. 28) to the Miami Heat for the draft rights to Bojan Bogdanovic (No. 31), a future second-round pick and cash considerations. The Timberwolves then traded Bogdanovic's rights to the New Jersey Nets for a future second-rounder and cash. The Trail Blazers traded the draft rights to Tanguy Ngombo (No. 57) to the Timberwolves.[58] On July 12, 2011, Kurt Rambis was fired as coach of the team after compiling a 32–132 record in two seasons with the team. On September 13, 2011, the team announced that they had hired Rick Adelman to be the team's new head coach.[59][60] The Timberwolves began the 2011–12 NBA season with a 17–17 record before the All-Star break.[61] On March 9, 2012, Rubio tore his left ACL and LCL in a collision with Kobe Bryant. The injury ended his season and severely hurt the Timberwolves' chances of making the playoffs. Despite being in contention at mid-season, the team ultimately failed to reach the postseason for the eighth straight year due to injuries to a number of key players.[62][63][64] The team finished with a record of 26–40, with the only win of the team's final 14 games coming against the Detroit Pistons. The team traded the 18th overall pick of the 2012 NBA draft to the Houston Rockets for Chase Budinger.[65][66][67][68] On June 26, 2012, the Timberwolves selected Robbie Hummel with the 58th overall pick, the team's only selection during the draft.[69] During the off-season, the team signed former Timberwolves draft pick Brandon Roy to a two-year, $10 million contract.[70] The deal was announced on July 31.[71] With the inclusion of Roy in the shooting guard position, players that also signed during the off-season included Andrei Kirilenko, Alexey Shved and Louis Amundson. While technically in playoff contention early, multiple injuries began to plague the team. Roy, Budinger, Lee and free-agent signing Josh Howard succumbed to knee injuries. The mood of despair was shortly lifted by the splashy return of Rubio.[72] But not long after, Love, who missed the first nine games of the season after fracturing the third and fourth metacarpals in his right hand in a preseason home workout, suffered a recurrence of the injury in a win over the Denver Nuggets on January 3.[73] One of the few highlights in the second half of the season was Rubio's triple-double performance during a surprising win over the then-first place San Antonio Spurs, albeit without Spurs stars Tony Parker and Tim Duncan playing due to injury.[74] On April 6, in a game against the Detroit Pistons, Adelman won his 1000th game as a head coach.[75] This season marked the first time the franchise had won at least 30 games without Kevin Garnett on the roster.[76] The team decided to part ways with David Kahn after the season ended, with Flip Saunders being brought in to replace him.[77] In the 2013 NBA draft, the team traded the 9th overall pick Trey Burke for Shabazz Muhammad (14th pick) and Gorgui Dieng (21st pick) in the first round from the Utah Jazz.[78] On March 28, 2014, the Timberwolves set a franchise record for points in a regular season game with a 143–107 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. The win also marked the Timberwolves' first season-series win over the Lakers since the 2005–06 season.[79] The team accumulated 40 wins for the first time since the 2004–05 season, but missed the playoffs for the tenth consecutive year, despite holding the league's highest point differential at the end of the season.[80] On April 21, 2014, Rick Adelman announced his retirement from coaching in the NBA. Adelman acquired a 97–133 record in three seasons with the team. On August 23, 2014, the Timberwolves, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Philadelphia 76ers agreed on a three-way trade that would send Kevin Love to the Cavaliers to join LeBron James and Kyrie Irving. Minnesota received Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, Thaddeus Young, and a trade exception as part of the deal. The 76ers received Alexey Shved, Luc Mbah a Moute, and a 2015 first-round pick via the Miami Heat.[81] The 2014–15 season marked a new era for the Timberwolves, beginning with the Kevin Love trade. Flip Saunders was promoted to head coach, making it his second stint with the Timberwolves after coaching the team from 1995 to 2005. The Timberwolves started the new season with a 105–101 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies, with Wiggins making his debut. The team recorded its first win the following game, a 97–91 victory over the Detroit Pistons.[82] On November 12, 2014, the Timberwolves played an international home game at Mexico City Arena against the Houston Rockets. The Timberwolves had a 16–66 record for the season and missed the playoffs for the 11th consecutive year. Despite this, Wiggins was selected as the NBA Rookie of the Year, the first player in franchise history to be so honored. Draft pick Zach LaVine gained league notoriety after winning the Slam Dunk Contest. LaVine and Wiggins, dubbed \"The Bounce Brothers\", were seen as being the future of the franchise.[83] Due to having the worst record in the NBA for the 2014–15 season, the Timberwolves had the highest chance, at 25%, to receive the first pick in the 2015 NBA draft at the 2015 NBA draft lottery. On May 19, the Timberwolves received the first overall pick in the 2015 NBA draft for the first time in franchise history. On June 25, the Timberwolves selected Karl-Anthony Towns as the number one pick and acquired Minnesota's own Tyus Jones through a trade with the Cleveland Cavaliers. The 2015 season also saw the return of Kevin Garnett. In February, Garnett, at the time with the Brooklyn Nets, waived his no-trade clause to enable a trade back to Minnesota which sent Thaddeus Young to Brooklyn. In his first game back, Garnett resumed wearing the No. 21 jersey that had not been worn by any other Timberwolves player since his departure and the team defeated the Washington Wizards 97–77 at the Target Center. On June 6, 2014, Flip Saunders was named the head coach of the Minnesota Timberwolves, returning to the franchise for a second stint.[84] During his second stint with the Timberwolves, Saunders was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. As a result, during his recovery, he would delegate his coaching position over to assistant coach and former NBA Coach of the Year winner Sam Mitchell. On October 25, 2015, Saunders died at age 60. Mitchell took over as head coach. In honor of Saunders, the team announced that they would wear a patch reading \"FLIP\" on their uniforms for the duration of the 2015–16 season.[85] On April 20, 2016, the Timberwolves agreed to sign Tom Thibodeau to be their head coach and president of basketball operations. He was previously an assistant coach for the team from 1989 to 1991.[86] On September 23, 2016, Kevin Garnett announced his retirement after 21 seasons in the NBA. He expressed interest in playing one more year for the Timberwolves but felt that his knees would be unable to hold up for the duration of the season. The Timberwolves ended their season with a 31–51 record, having only a two-game improvement from their previous season. On June 22, 2017, the Timberwolves acquired Jimmy Butler and the 16th overall pick in the 2017 draft in trade for Zach Lavine, Kris Dunn and the 7th overall pick in the draft (used to select Lauri Markkanen).[87] This trade marked the end of the LaVine and Wiggins duo, dubbed \"Bounce Brothers\". Later that night, the Timberwolves selected center Justin Patton with the 16th overall pick in the draft. Later, the team added Taj Gibson, Jeff Teague, Jamal Crawford and Derrick Rose during free agency. The Timberwolves ended their season with a 47–35 record, which became the first winning season since the 2004–05 season, and secured the last spot in the playoffs on the final day of the regular season with a 112–106 win over the Denver Nuggets. The 2017–18 season also ended the longest streak without a playoff appearance at 13 seasons. The Timberwolves would be eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Houston Rockets in five games. On November 12, 2018, the Timberwolves traded Butler and Justin Patton to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for Robert Covington, Dario Šarić, Jerryd Bayless and a 2022 second-round draft pick.[88] On January 6, 2019, Thibodeau was fired as head coach and president of basketball operations. After Thibodeau's firing, it was announced that Ryan Saunders would serve as interim head coach until a permanent head coach is found.[89] On May 1, it was announced that the Timberwolves had hired Gersson Rosas, who previously served as the Houston Rockets' executive vice president of basketball operations, as their new president of basketball operations.[90] On May 20, after conducting interviews with several candidates, the Timberwolves announced that Ryan Saunders had been hired to a multi-year deal to become the team's permanent head coach, removing his \"interim\" status.[91][92] With Rosas' hiring, the Timberwolves also made several front office changes in the organization. The Timberwolves held both a first- and second-round draft pick in the 2019 NBA draft. The 11th pick (which was Cameron Johnson) along with Dario Šarić was traded to the Suns in exchange for the 6th pick in Jarrett Culver, a small forward from Texas Tech. With the 43rd pick, the Timberwolves selected Jaylen Nowell, a point guard from Washington. They would also sign Naz Reid, and undrafted center from Louisiana State.[93] On February 6, 2020, The Timberwolves traded Andrew Wiggins to the Golden State Warriors for Karl-Anthony Towns' longtime friend D'Angelo Russell. At the season's end the Timberwolves got the 1st pick in the 2020 NBA draft.[94] With that pick, the team drafted Anthony Edwards out of Georgia.[95] In that same draft, they would trade up to select Jaden McDaniels with the 28th pick.[96] On February 21, 2021, head coach Ryan Saunders was fired, and Toronto Raptors assistant coach Chris Finch was hired to replace him.[97][98] The Timberwolves finished the season 23-49 and missed the playoffs.[99] In April 2021, the Timberwolves announced that owner Glen Taylor had reached a deal with Marc Lore and Alex Rodriguez to sell the team. According to the deal, Lore and Rodriguez would become majority owners over the course of two years. On July 21, 2021, it was announced that Lore and Rodriguez had purchased 20% of the team. They went on to purchase 20% more in 2022 before the deal stalled in 2024. The transaction also includes ownership in the Timberwolves' WNBA sister-club, the Minnesota Lynx.[100] The deal valued the team at $1.5 billion.[101] In the off-season the Wolves traded guard Ricky Rubio to the Cleveland Cavaliers for forward Taurean Prince.[102] The Wolves then acquired guard Patrick Beverley in exchange for Juancho Hernangomez and former first round pick Jarrett Culver.[103] The final move they made was signing former 2020 draft pick Leandro Bolmaro to a 4-year, 11.8-million-dollar rookie contract.[104] On September 22, 2021, after Gersson Rosas was relieved of his President of Basketball Operations duties,[105] Sachin Gupta was promoted as the new interim president of basketball operations, while keeping his role as EVP of basketball operations.[106] The Timberwolves finished the 2021–22 season with a 46–36 record, the second-most regular season wins since making the conference finals in 2004. Despite All-Star Karl-Anthony Towns fouling out with 11 points in 24 minutes, the Wolves beat the Los Angeles Clippers in the play-in game to secure their spot in the 2022 NBA playoffs. The Timberwolves were eliminated by the Memphis Grizzlies in the first round in six games.[107] On May 23, 2022, it was announced that the Timberwolves had hired Tim Connelly, who previously served as the Denver Nuggets' president of basketball operations, as their president of basketball operations, taking over Gupta's job. He was reportedly signed to a 5-year, $40 million contract by the Timberwolves, that includes ownership equity.[108] On July 1, 2022, the Timberwolves traded Malik Beasley, Patrick Beverley, Jarred Vanderbilt, Leandro Bolmaro, and 2022 22nd pick Walker Kessler and 4 future first round draft picks for 3x NBA DPOY Rudy Gobert from the Utah Jazz.[109] The Timberwolves began the 2022–23 season with high expectations following the Gobert trade. They were dealt a blow on November 28, 2022, when Karl-Anthony Towns suffered a severe calf strain that cost him 52 games.[110] The injury pushed Anthony Edwards into a leadership role,[111] with the first-time All-Star guiding the team to a 42–40 finish and a play-in tournament berth. After falling to the Los Angeles Lakers in the first game, the Timberwolves secured the 8th seed with a 25-point win over the Oklahoma City Thunder.[112] They went on to lose to the first seed (and eventual NBA champion), the Denver Nuggets, in the first round in five games.[113] The 2023–24 season was their best since 2004, as they recorded 56 wins and landed the third seed in the Western Conference. They were the no. 1 defense in the league,[114] anchored by eventual DPOY winner Rudy Gobert and All-Defensive selection Jaden McDaniels. Anthony Edwards made his first All-NBA Team, Karl-Anthony Towns made his fourth All-Star Appearance, and fan favorite[115] Naz Reid was named Sixth Man of the Year.[116] On March 28, 2024, Glen Taylor announced that the sale of the team to prospective owners Marc Lore and Alex Rodriguez was off.[117] Lore and Rodriguez were expected to make their third and final payment installment to Taylor on March 27, 2024, raising their ownership interest from 40% to 80% in both the Timberwolves and Lynx, stemming from the April 2021 agreement to purchase the team.[118] However, Lore and Rodriguez's payment was not made by the deadline. It is unclear what exactly transpired leading to the deal falling through. On March 20, 2024, it was reported the Lore and Rodriguez lost the financial backing of the Carlyle Group that had previously pledged $300 million towards the final installment.[119] On March 21, 2024, it appeared as if Lore and Rodriguez had secured the backing of Blue Owl Capital to keep the sale on track.[120] Lore and Rodriguez state they filed the necessary paperwork for league approval prior to the March 27, 2024, payment deadline, which should have granted them a ninety-day extension to submit the funds to Taylor.[118] The parties met to mediate the dispute on May 1, 2024, but no agreement was reached.[118] On June 6, 2024, it was announced that Michael Bloomberg would join Rodriguez and Lore's ownership group.[121] In the first round of the 2024 playoffs, the Timberwolves swept the Phoenix Suns 4–0. It was their first series win since 2004, and the first series sweep in Minnesota men's professional sports history. The series saw Anthony Edwards ascend into rarefied air, becoming the 2nd player under 22 to record a 30/5/5 statline in multiple playoff games.[122] His performance spurred widespread comparisons to a young Michael Jordan,[123] even from Jordan himself.[124] In the conference semifinals, the Timberwolves squared off with the Denver Nuggets in a highly anticipated rematch of their 2023 first round series. After a nailbiter Game 1, the teams spent the next five games trading blowouts, leaving things 3–3 heading back to Denver for Game 7. Down 15 points at half, the Timberwolves led a miraculous comeback, winning the game 98–90 and securing a spot in the Western Conference finals — 20 years to the day of their last conference finals appearance.[125] Their run ended when they lost to the Dallas Mavericks in five games.[126] In the 2024 NBA Draft, they traded up to select Kentucky guard Rob Dillingham with the 8th pick.[127] During the 2024 offseason, the Timberwolves traded All-Star Karl-Anthony Towns to the New York Knicks for fellow big man All-Star Julius Randle, sharpshooter Donte DiVincenzo and a first round pick, ending an era for the Timberwolves.[128] Reigning Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert was signed to a 3-year, $110 million extension.[129] In their inaugural season in 1989, the Timberwolves (or \"Wolves\" as it said on their jerseys) debuted blue road uniforms with green lettering and numbers with white. Their home uniforms featured blue lettering and numbers with green outlining. The creation of both uniforms was led by head designer, Brian Mulligan.[130] There was going to be a green alternate jersey with blue lettering to go with the uniforms, but the idea was dropped. It would've followed a similar move the Dallas Mavericks took when they switched back to blue in the early 1990s, opting the Wolves a chance to use green for a jersey color instead.[130] The Timberwolves would resurrect the blue uniforms from this era during the 2009–10 season, as part of the franchise's 20th anniversary.[131] After drafting Kevin Garnett, the Timberwolves design team, under guidance from Brian Mulligan, changed their uniforms in 1996.[130] This time, the team added black and gray to the mix, and changing to a darker shade of blue.[130] The front of the jerseys then said the team's full name \"Timberwolves\" in a different font. For the 1997–98 season, a black alternate uniform was introduced. Those uniforms were used until the 2007–08 season.[130] The Timberwolves unveiled a new alternate logo on June 25, 2008.[132] The uniforms changed again in the 2008 off-season, this time with the road jerseys reading \"Minnesota\" and the home jerseys reading \"Wolves\", similar to that of the team's early years. Both uniforms had green, black, gray and blue on the pits and sides of the shorts.[133] The Timberwolves unveiled modified uniforms on August 16, 2010. The new uniforms eliminated the green from the collar, jersey and shorts, and the team also adjusted its number font again.[134] On November 23, 2010, the Timberwolves unveiled a black alternate uniform.[135][136] On November 27, 2013, the team changed their black road alternate jersey to a short sleeved jersey. The change came about due to the NBA's introduction of sleeved jerseys.[137] On April 11, 2017, the team unveiled a new logo to coincide with the massive roster turnaround of the past few years.[138][4] The Timberwolves revealed four new uniforms for the 2017–18 season as a part of a Nike-sponsored, league-wide initiative to redesign team uniforms.[139][140] All four uniforms used \"Wolves\" for the team name and included the Nike Swoosh and Fitbit logos. The Association Edition uniform, revealed on August 10, 2017, consisted of a white uniform with navy and blue stripes and lettering.[139][141] The Icon Edition uniform, which was revealed alongside its Association counterpart, has a navy body with white stripes and lettering.[139][141] On September 15, the Timberwolves revealed their Statement Edition uniform which is primarily neon green with navy stripes, navy lettering for the team and player names, and white text with a navy stroke for the jersey numbers.[142][143] The City Edition uniform, which is primarily gray with white lettering, was the last to be revealed on December 27.[144][145] On August 30, 2018, the Timberwolves unveiled their first \"Classic\" edition uniforms based on the black alternates used from 1997 to 2008.[146] They also unveiled a dark purple \"City\" uniform inspired by Prince's 1984 album Purple Rain, as well as a white \"Earned\" version that was exclusive only to the 16 teams that made the 2018 playoffs.[147][148] The Timberwolves' 2019–20 \"City\" uniform, which was unveiled on November 20, 2019, featured a sky blue base with white letters and trim that paid homage to the waters of the Mississippi River and the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area (the \"Twin Cities\").[149] For the 2020–21 season, the Timberwolves' \"City\" uniform paid homage to the North Star, featuring a midnight black base and aurora green trim. A green star is affixed below the neckline and above the abbreviation \"MINN\" in gray.[150] As part of the NBA's 75th anniversary, the Timberwolves' \"City\" uniform in the 2021–22 season mixed various elements from the franchise's previous uniforms. The royal blue base recalled the original 1989–1996 uniforms. The tree accents and lettering visually honored the 1996–2008 uniforms. The dark blue accents were inspired by the 2017–18 \"City\" uniforms. The original 1989–1996 logo was placed on the right leg, while the current logo was affixed on the left leg.[151] Beginning with the 2022–23 season, the Timberwolves unveiled a new \"Statement\" uniform, relegating neon green to trim color and featured a dark gray base. The full name \"Timberwolves\" was featured in front along with green-trimmed gray numbers.[152] Also during the season, a new \"City\" uniform was unveiled, featuring a white base, black letters and stripes, and rainbow palette to represent Minnesota's colorful community.[153] The \"City\" uniform in the 2023–24 season featured a mostly blue base with white lake water gradients; the design represented the fun summertime activities of Minnesota's citizens, from camping to fishing and swimming.[154] A special alternate court for the 2023 NBA in-season tournament was also unveiled to go with this uniform, featuring a light blue base with a lakewater blue strip in the middle.[155] Also for the season, the Timberwolves brought back the original 1989–1996 white uniform for its \"Classic\" edition, this to celebrate the franchise's 35th season. This was paired with a modernized version of the original court used at the Target Center.[156] The 2024–25 \"City\" uniform served as the inverse of last season's \"City\" uniform, this time with a mostly white base, ice blue gradients and black accents. The design was meant to capture Minnesota's winter landscape, with white and ice blue gradients representing the state's frozen lakes during winter.[157] Crunch the Wolf is the official mascot of the Minnesota Timberwolves, According to the team's official website, \"Crunch was born in the northernmost part of Minnesota’s wilderness areas. Deep in the forest, he grew with a love for something never before seen by others in his pack. Crunch's love for the game of basketball puzzled his mother and father, for he seemed to pick up the game on his own. With a makeshift basket built of pine-cones and birch bark, Crunch began to refine his game when he was still just a young pup. He learned the rules and techniques that make the game of basketball so great. He studied players and coaches alike, and soon would find himself on a journey like no other. Years later, when Minnesota’s expansion team, the Timberwolves, came to town, Crunch said goodbye to all he had known growing up in the woods, and migrated south to the Twin Cities where the team was to be based. No one is quite sure where Crunch lives, but legend has it he has a den somewhere deep inside the Target Center. He is lured out on game-days by the deafening howl made by Wolves fans. This howl creates an atmosphere in the Target Center that reminds Crunch of his days back in the forest, and yet keeps him here in Minneapolis, with the pursuit of helping the team to a victory.\"[158] List of the last five seasons completed by the Timberwolves. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Minnesota Timberwolves seasons. Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W–L% = Winning percentage Roster Last transaction: November 29, 2024 The Timberwolves hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.[159] This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. As of 2023, the Minnesota Timberwolves air all of their games on the iHeartRadio app, with select games airing on KFXN-FM 100.3 FM within the Twin Cities.[166] WCCO had been the team's radio home from 2011 until the end of the 2022–23 season.[167] Before that, KFAN/KFXN had been the Timberwolves' Twin Cities flagship station since the team's inception, except for a brief two-year hiatus to KLCI BOB 106.1 FM for the 2006–07 and 2007–08 seasons. Alan Horton has been the team's radio play-by-play announcer since the 2007–08 season.[168] The Timberwolves' games are broadcast primarily on Bally Sports North. But if the Minnesota Twins and Minnesota Wild occupy both Bally Sports North and Bally Sports North Extra, the game will be aired on WUCW as Bally Sports North Extra on The CW Twin Cities, and the Bally Sports app for viewers outside of WUCW's coverage area.[169] The broadcasters are Michael Grady and Jim Petersen.[170][171][172] 2022–2023",

He quickly joined the Nationals’ Dominican Academy and immediately began to immerse himself in English by using the Rosetta Stone language-learning software lessons. Soto initially practiced English for one hour a day, five days a week. After the Dominican Academy, Soto joined the Nationals’ Class A affiliate, the Hagerstown Suns. He met Suns catcher Tres Barrera, who was born in Texas to Mexican parents. Soto told Barrera that he only wanted the two of them to converse in English. Barrera told the Washington Post that he remembered how Soto would go to a McDonald’s near the Hagerstown ballpark every day to practice his English by ordering from the menu. When Soto was called up to the Nationals, he told manager Dave Martinez, “No Spanish, only English.” Soto himself also recalled the role that his mother played in his English lessons. “I remember her telling me that if I wanted to be a star, I had to know the language in the country I wanted to play in,” he reflected. “She was right.

                "content": "WASHINGTON — Juan Soto figures he was probably 12 years old when he returned home one day, after completing three levels of English courses, and told his mom he was done. He didn't want to learn the new language anymore. He didn't need to learn it anymore. \"She tells me if I want to be a baseball player, I have to learn,\" Soto recalled. \"I said, ‘No, I just have to play baseball.'\" But as Soto kept just playing baseball, his perspective changed. The Washington Nationals signed him to a contract in 2015 and gave him a $1.5-million signing bonus. They shipped the then-16-year-old Dominican outfielder to their academy in Boca Chica, a complex about an hour east of his hometown of Santo Domingo and a few miles from the beach. He started to think of English not as a chore, but as another skill to be mastered on his way to the big leagues. \"If you want to be a superstar,\" Soto told USA TODAY Sports, \"you’ve got to be ready in every spot.\" All things Nationals: Latest Washington Nationals news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more. Soto, now 20, has emerged as one of baseball's bright young stars over the past year – and one of the main reasons the Nationals felt comfortable letting Bryce Harper walk in free agency. But beyond his patience at the plate and ability to crush fastballs, he has most impressed teammates and staff with the dedication he's put into English – not just learning the language, but perfecting it. \"He was first to graduate at the (Dominican) academy, speaking English,\" Nationals manager Dave Martinez told USA TODAY Sports. \"He’s very adamant about fitting in and being a part of this culture, as well as back at home.\" According to statistics provided by MLB, more than 25 percent of players on Opening Day rosters this season hailed from Spanish-speaking countries, including more than 100 players from the Dominican Republic alone. Some players prefer to stick to their native tongues. Others work to pick up conversational English, to better communicate with their teammates and fans. Few pick it up as quickly as Soto has. \"It’s tough, definitely. It’s really tough,\" said Venezuelan-born pitcher Anibal Sanchez, who explained that he spoke zero English when he first joined the Boston Red Sox organization in 2001. \"When I came to the U.S., as soon as I got out of the plane, they asked me where I was from. And the answer was my name. The guy started laughing at me, but it is what it is at that point.\" Sanchez said he's taken online classes with a private teacher even in recent years to improve his English. For Soto, the process really started when he signed with the team less than four years ago – though he admits he did have a slight head start, thanks to his mom. When he arrived in Boca Chica, the staff gave Soto a log-in for Rosetta Stone and required him, like other prospects at the academy, to study English for at least one hour a day, five days per week. Soto met that daily requirement – and then some. \"Everybody goes to sleep and all this stuff, and I stayed awake and said ‘oh, let’s do some English,'\" Soto said. \"I started working. I (did) like two hours, one (more) hour every day. That’s why I finished really fast.\" The following year, when Soto graduated to the Gulf Coast League – the lowest rung of the minors – he used it as an opportunity to pick up more real-world experience. He spoke with his American teammates often, and found a safe learning space at a nearby McDonald's, where employees didn't judge him for saying the incorrect word or phrase. Soto became so articulate so quickly that by the time the Nationals called him up last spring, at 19, he was already able to conduct interviews in English. \"I didn’t even know we’ve got to talk with the media every day. So I was like… Wow,\" Soto said with a smile. \"I was a little nervous, but every word I said, I was like ‘Oh, I can do it in English.’ So I started doing it in English since the first day.\" Octavio Martinez, the Nationals' translator, flanked Soto during interviews with reporters when he was called up. And he's still on hand now, in case Soto misses a word or doesn't understand a question. But Martinez said he's rarely needed. \"I’m definitely very impressed – the fact that at such a young age, he’s able to comprehend it so well,\" Martinez said. \"I think the biggest thing is just his confidence, which shows on the field. He’s so confident. It’s the same thing with him talking to the media – he’s confident in what he’s going to say.\" Now, even two months into his second big-league season, Soto is the fourth-youngest player in the majors. He finished second in National League Rookie of the Year voting last season and has already racked up six home runs and 22 RBI this year, despite spending the past eight days on the injured list with back spasms. (He is eligible to return Saturday.) Soto said he's still working on his English every day, mostly by talking with teammates. The language has become important to him on the field, and even more so beyond it. He wants to be able to communicate with reporters in interviews, but also feel comfortable interacting with fans who might approach him at a restaurant and ask for an autograph. \"You’ve got to be comfortable to talk with them, and they’ve got to be comfortable with you talking, to ask everything they want,\" Soto explained. \"That’s why (stars) are stars. They’re good in every spot.\" Contact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad.",

                "title": "Jay-Z - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Shawn Corey Carter (born December 4, 1969), known professionally as Jay-Z,[a] is an American rapper, businessman, and record executive.[8][9][10] Rooted in East Coast hip-hop, he was named the greatest rapper of all time by Billboard and Vibe in 2023, and topped Forbes list of \"The 50 Top Rappers Of All Time\" in 2024.[11][12] Known for his complex lyrical ability—which often uses double entendres and word play—and braggadocio, his music is built upon a rags to riches narrative. He served as president and chief executive officer of Def Jam Recordings from 2004 to 2007, and founded the entertainment company Roc Nation the following year.[13] A protégé of fellow New York City-based rapper Jaz-O, Jay-Z began his musical career in the late 1980s; he co-founded the record label Roc-A-Fella Records in 1994 to release his first two studio albums Reasonable Doubt (1996) and In My Lifetime, Vol. 1 (1997), both of which were met with critical acclaim. Each of his eleven subsequent albums, including The Blueprint (2001), The Black Album (2003), American Gangster (2007), and 4:44 (2017), debuted atop the Billboard 200; Jay-Z holds the record for the most number-one albums (14) of any solo artist on the chart.[14][15][16] He has also released the collaborative albums The Best of Both Worlds (2002) and Unfinished Business (2004) with singer R. Kelly,[17] Collision Course (2004) with Linkin Park, Watch the Throne (2011) with Kanye West, and Everything Is Love (2018) with his wife Beyoncé.[18] He peaked the Billboard Hot 100 on four occasions: once as a lead artist with his 2009 single \"Empire State of Mind\" (featuring Alicia Keys), and thrice with his guest performances on the singles \"Heartbreaker\" by Mariah Carey, \"Crazy in Love\" by Beyoncé, and \"Umbrella\" by Rihanna.[19] Through his business ventures, Jay-Z became the first hip-hop billionaire in 2019.[20][21] In 1999, he co-founded the clothing retailer Rocawear[22] and later founded the 40/40 Club, a luxury bar chain, in 2003. As both grew into multi-million-dollar businesses, he launched Roc Nation, a multi-disciplinary entertainment agency in 2008. In 2015, he acquired the technology company Aspiro and led the expansion of Tidal, the company's media streaming service.[23][24][25] As of 2024, he is the wealthiest musical artist in the world with a net worth of US$2.5 billion.[26] One of the world's best-selling music artists with 140 million records sold, Jay-Z has won 24 Grammy Awards, the tenth-most of all time and most awarded for any hip hop artist jointly with Kanye West.[27] He has been awarded the NAACP's President's Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, a Sports Emmy Award, and been nominated for a Tony Award. Ranked by Billboard and Rolling Stone as one of the 100 greatest artists of all time,[28][29] Jay-Z was the first rapper to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame[30] and the first solo living rapper inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2013.[8] Shawn Corey Carter was born on December 4, 1969, in Brooklyn, New York City.[31] He was raised in Marcy Houses, a public housing project in Brooklyn's Bedford–Stuyvesant neighborhood.[32] His father, Adnis Reeves,[33] abandoned the family when Jay-Z was 11 years old, and Jay-Z and his three older siblings were raised by his mother, Gloria Carter. Reeves later met and reconciled with Jay-Z prior to his death in 2003. Jay-Z claims in his lyrics to \"You Must Love Me\", the closing track on his 1997 album In My Lifetime, Vol. 1, that in 1982, at age 12, he shot his older brother Eric in the shoulder for stealing his jewelry.[34][35] He attended Eli Whitney High School and George Westinghouse Career and Technical Education High School, both in Brooklyn, and then Trenton Central High School in Trenton, New Jersey. He did not graduate, dropping out during his sophomore year at Trenton Central High School.[36] According to his interviews and lyrics, he sold crack cocaine[35] and was shot at three times during this period.[34] His former friend was sentenced to prison for possessing drugs and weapons.[37][38] Known as \"Jazzy\" around the neighborhood, he later adopted the stage name \"Jay-Z\" in homage to his mentor Jaz-O.[32][39] Jay-Z can be briefly heard on several of Jaz-O's early recordings in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including \"H. P. Gets Busy\", \"The Originators\" and \"Hawaiian Sophie\".[40][41] Jay-Z became embroiled in several battles with rapper LL Cool J in the early 1990s.[42] He first became known to a wide audience on the posse cut \"Show and Prove\" on the 1994 Big Daddy Kane album Daddy's Home. Jay-Z has been referred to as Big Daddy Kane's hype man during this period,[43] although Kane explains that he did not fill the traditional hype man role, and was instead basically making cameo appearances on stage. \"When I would leave the stage to go change outfits, I would bring out Jay-Z and Positive K and let them freestyle until I came back to the stage.\"[44][45] According to his second verse on \"99 Problems\", released in 2003, Jay-Z was allegedly stopped by an NYPD detective in 1994 while en route to I-95, possibly for a search of drugs in his car. Detection dogs were called, but another police car had passed; Jay-Z was let go soon after.[46] Jay-Z appeared on a popular song by Big L, \"Da Graveyard\", and on Mic Geronimo's \"Time to Build\", which also featured early appearances by his former Murder Inc. colleagues Ja Rule and DMX in 1995. His first official rap single was \"In My Lifetime\", which was released with an accompanying music video in 1995. An unreleased music video was also produced for the B-side \"I Can't Get with That.\"[47] With no major label to give him a record deal, Jay-Z sold burned CDs out of his car,[34] and with Damon \"Dame\" Dash and Kareem \"Biggs\" Burke, created Roc-A-Fella Records as an independent label in 1995. After striking a distribution deal with Priority, Jay-Z released his 1996 debut album Reasonable Doubt with beats from acclaimed producers such as DJ Premier and Super DJ Clark Kent and an appearance by The Notorious B.I.G. The album reached number 23 on the Billboard 200, and was generally favored by critics.[32] This album would later be included in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time as No. 248 and eventually reach platinum status.[48] After reaching a new label distribution deal with Def Jam in 1997, Jay-Z released his follow-up In My Lifetime, Vol. 1. Featuring production by Sean \"Puff Daddy\" Combs, DJ Premier, and Ski, it earned platinum status in the United States.[48] In 1998, Jay-Z released Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life which spawned the biggest hit of his career at the time, \"Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)\". He relied more on flow and wordplay, and he continued with his penchant for mining beats from the popular producers of the day such as Swizz Beatz, an upstart in-house producer for Ruff Ryders, and Timbaland.[49] Other producers included DJ Premier, Erick Sermon, The 45 King, and Kid Capri. Charting hits from this album included \"Can I Get A...\", featuring Ja Rule and Amil, and \"Nigga What, Nigga Who\", featuring Amil and Jaz-O. Vol. 2 would eventually become Jay-Z's most commercially successful album; it was certified 5× Platinum in the United States and has to date sold over five million copies.[48] The album went on to win a Grammy Award, although Jay-Z boycotted the ceremony protesting DMX's failure to garner a Grammy nomination and the academy's decision to not broadcast urban music categories.[50] In 1999, Jay-Z collaborated with Mariah Carey on \"Heartbreaker\", a song from her seventh album, Rainbow. The song became Jay-Z's first chart-topper in the U.S., spending two weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100.[51] In that same year, Jay-Z released Vol. 3... Life and Times of S. Carter. The album proved successful and sold over 3 million copies.[48] Vol. 3's most successful single was \"Big Pimpin\", featuring UGK. In 2000, Jay-Z released The Dynasty: Roc La Familia, which was originally intended to become a compilation album for Roc-A-Fella artists but Def Jam turned into a Jay-Z album.[52] The album helped to introduce newcomer producers The Neptunes, Just Blaze, Kanye West, and Bink, which have all gone on to achieve notable success. This is also the first album where Jay-Z utilizes a more soulful sound than his previous albums. The Dynasty sold over two million units in the U.S. alone.[48] In 2001, Jay-Z spoke out against Prodigy after he took an issue with a Jay-Z line from \"Money, Cash, Hoes\" that he felt alluded disparagingly to Mobb Deep and Prodigy's dispute with Tupac Shakur, Snoop Dogg, and Death Row Records. He later performed the song \"Takeover\", at Summer Jam 2001, which initially attacked Prodigy and revealed photos of Prodigy dressed like Michael Jackson.[53] A line at the end of \"Takeover\" referred to Nas, who criticized him on \"We Will Survive\".[54] Nas responded with a diss of his own, and Jay-Z straightaway added a verse to \"Takeover\" which dissed Nas and would start a feud between the two rappers. The feud had ended by 2005; Jay-Z stated that record producer Mark Pitts had helped them settle their differences.[55] On September 11, 2001, Jay-Z released his sixth studio album, The Blueprint, which received a five-mic review from hip-hop magazine The Source. Written in just two days,[56] the album sold more than 427,000 copies, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200[57] and reached double platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America.[48] Eminem guest performed and produced its song, \"Renegade\". Four tracks were produced by Kanye West. The Blueprint includes the songs \"Izzo (H.O.V.A.)\", \"Girls, Girls, Girls\", \"Jigga That Nigga\", and \"Song Cry\". As of February 2012[update], the album had sold 2.7 million copies worldwide.[58] In 2019, The Blueprint was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[59] In October 2001, Jay-Z pleaded guilty to aggravated assault for stabbing record producer Lance Rivera at the Kit Kat Klub in New York City in 1999.[60] Despite Jay-Z's sentence of three years probation for the crime, Rivera later recanted the allegations in 2023.[61][62] Jay-Z then collaborated with Chicago singer R. Kelly to release collaborative studio album, The Best of Both Worlds in March 2002. In November of that year, Jay-Z released his seventh studio album The Blueprint2: The Gift & The Curse—a double album. The album debuted on the Billboard 200 at number one, selling over 3 million units solely in the U.S.[48] and surpassing The Blueprint.[63] It yielded a single-disc re-issue, The Blueprint 2.1, which retained half of the songs from the original. Its original release spawned two hit singles, \"Excuse Me Miss\" and \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\", which features Jay-Z's then-girlfriend, Beyoncé, and contained the track \"A Dream\", featuring Faith Evans and the late Notorious B.I.G.; the re-issue spawned the single \"La-La-La\", which was a sequel to \"Excuse Me Miss\" and failed to match its commercial success. After visiting the south of France,[64] Jay-Z announced work on his eighth studio album, The Black Album at the opening of the 40/40 Club.[65] He worked with several producers including Just Blaze, The Neptunes, Kanye West, Timbaland, Eminem, DJ Quik, 9th Wonder, The Buchanans, and Rick Rubin. Notable songs on the album included \"What More Can I Say\", \"Dirt off Your Shoulder\", \"Change Clothes\", and \"99 Problems\". The Black Album has sold over 3 million copies in the U.S.[48] On November 25, 2003, Jay-Z held a concert—billed as a \"retirement party\" at Madison Square Garden in New York City, which was later the focus of his 2004 documentary, Fade to Black. All proceeds went to charity. Other performers included collaborators the Roots (in the form of his backing band), Missy Elliott, Memphis Bleek, Beanie Siegel, Freeway, Mary J. Blige, Beyoncé, Twista, Ghostface Killah, Foxy Brown, Pharrell Williams and R. Kelly, with appearances by Voletta Wallace and Afeni Shakur, the mothers of the Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur, respectively.[66] While Jay-Z had attested to a retirement from making new studio albums, various side projects and appearances soon followed. Included in these were a greatest hits record, as well as the release and tour of Unfinished Business, the second collaborative album between Jay-Z and R. Kelly. In 2004, Jay-Z collaborated with rock group Linkin Park, in which they released their collaborative remix EP Collision Course, which featured mashups of both artists' songs, as well as a concert DVD. The album's only single, \"Numb/Encore\", went on to win a Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration, and was performed with Linkin Park live at the Grammys, with a special appearance by Paul McCartney, who added verses from the song \"Yesterday\". The EP sold over 1 million copies in the U.S.[48] Jay-Z was the executive producer of The Rising Tied, the debut album of Fort Minor, the hip hop side project of Linkin Park rapper Mike Shinoda. Jay-Z also planned to retire in 2004.[67] Later in 2004, Jay-Z was named president of Def Jam Records, which led to Jay-Z, Dash and Biggs selling their remaining interests in Roc-A-Fella Records and Jay-Z taking control of both of the companies.[68] Reportedly this major industry move was prompted by disagreements between Jay-Z and Dash as to what direction Roc-A-Fella could undertake.[69] On October 27, 2005, Jay-Z headlined New York's Power 105.1 annual concert, Powerhouse. The concert was entitled the \"I Declare War\" concert leading to intense speculation in the weeks preceding the event on whom exactly Jay-Z would declare war. As he had previously \"declared war\" on other artists taking lyrical shots at him at other events, many believed that the Powerhouse show would represent an all-out assault by Jay-Z upon his rivals.[70] The theme of the concert was Jay-Z's position as president and CEO of Def Jam, complete with an on-stage mock-up of the Oval Office. Many artists made appearances such as the old roster of Roc-A-Fella records artists, as well as Ne-Yo, Teairra Marí, T.I., Young Jeezy, Akon, Kanye West, Paul Wall, The LOX, and Diddy.[71] At the conclusion of the concert, Jay-Z put many arguments to rest to the surprise of hip hop fans. The most significant development in this show was closure to the infamous hip hop rivalry between Jay-Z and Nas. The two former rivals shook hands and shared the stage together to perform Jay-Z's \"Dead Presidents\" blended with Nas's song \"The World is Yours\".[72] Jay-Z returned with his comeback album on November 21, 2006, titled Kingdom Come.[73] Jay-Z's comeback single, \"Show Me What You Got\", was leaked on the Internet in early October 2006, scheduled to be released later on that month, received heavy air-play after its leak, causing the FBI to step in and investigate.[74] Jay-Z worked with video director Hype Williams, and the single's video was directed by F. Gary Gray. The album features production from Just Blaze, Pharrell, Kanye West, Dr. Dre and Coldplay's Chris Martin (single entitled \"Beach Chair\").[75][76] The first week saw 680,000 sales of the CD, enough to be his \"biggest sales week ever\" as Billboard reported.[77] This album has sold 2 million copies in the U.S.[48] Jay-Z released his tenth album entitled American Gangster on November 6, 2007. After viewing the Ridley Scott film of the same name, Jay-Z was heavily inspired to create a new \"concept\" album that depicts his experiences as a street-hustler.[78] The album is not the film's official soundtrack, although it was distributed by Def Jam.[79] Jay-Z's American Gangster depicts his life in correlation to the movie American Gangster. At the start of the album's first single, \"Blue Magic\", Jay-Z offers a dealer's manifesto while making references to political figures of the late 1980s with the lyric: \"Blame Reagan for making me to into a monster, blame Oliver North and Iran-Contra, I ran contraband that they sponsored, before this rhymin' stuff we was in concert.\"[80] Also notable about the \"Blue Magic\" music video was Jay-Z flashing €500 notes; Harvard Business School professor Rawi Abdelal called this a \"turning point in American pop culture's response to globalization.\" The album has sold 1 million copies in the U.S.[48] On January 1, 2008, Jay-Z resigned as president of Def Jam.[81] In winter 2008, it was announced that Jay-Z would become the first major hip hop artist to headline Britain's Glastonbury Festival.[82][83] Tickets sold out quickly. Former headliner Noel Gallagher of Oasis condemned the festival organizers for choosing Jay-Z to headline a traditionally guitar-driven festival. \"I'm sorry, but Jay-Z?\" Gallagher asked, swearing. \"No chance. Glastonbury has a tradition of, kind of, guitar music, do you know what I mean? And even when they throw the odd curve balls in on a Sunday night—you go, 'Kylie Minogue? I don't know about that', do you know what I mean?—but I'm not having hip hop at Glastonbury, no way, no, no. It's wrong.\"[84] As controversy mounted, Jay-Z replied, \"We don't play guitars, Noel, but hip hop has put in its work like any other form of music. This headline show is just a natural progression. Rap music is still evolving. We have to respect each other's genre of music and move forward.\"[85] Jay-Z opened his Glastonbury set with a tongue-in-cheek cover of Oasis's iconic song \"Wonderwall\",[86] and went on to deliver a performance heralded as a successful response to pre-festival criticism.[87] He also headlined many other summer festivals in 2008, including Roskilde Festival in Denmark,[88] Hove Festival in Norway[89] and O2 Wireless Festival in London.[90] During Kanye West's concert of August 6, 2008, at Madison Square Garden, Jay-Z came out to perform a new song and he and West proclaimed that it was to be on The Blueprint 3.[91] On May 21, 2009, Jay-Z announced he would be parting ways with Def Jam, and had struck a multi-million-dollar deal to sign with Live Nation, with whom he would start his Roc Nation imprint which would serve as a record label, talent/management agency, and music publishing company[92] and also partnered with production team Stargate to start a record label called StarRoc.[93][94] Jay-Z's 11th studio album The Blueprint 3 was originally to be released on September 11, 2009,[95] but was instead released in North America on September 8, 2009, due to increasing anticipation.[96] Its international release followed on September 14.[97] It is his 11th album to reach No. 1 on the Billboard 200[98] and has surpassed Elvis Presley's previous record, making him the current solo-artist record holder.[99] On October 9, 2009, Jay-Z kicked off his tour for The Blueprint 3, during which he supported his new album in North America. In a Shave Magazine review of his performance at Rexall Place in Edmonton, Jake Tomlinson expressed that \"It was the type of smooth performance you would expect from the hip-hop superstar.\" The review gave this performance 4 stars. His North American tour continued until November 22, 2009.[100] At his concert on November 8, 2009, at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion, Rihanna joined him on stage and performed \"Hard\" for the first time, then performed \"Run This Town\" with Jay-Z.[101] Among his success, Jay-Z has ventured into producing Broadway shows. Along with Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith, Jay-Z helped produce the play Fela!, a musical celebrating the work of the late Nigerian star Fela Kuti.[102] Jay-Z said he was inspired by the power of Kuti's work and his life story, which resulted in his interest to help produce the musical.[102] Fela! is a story about an African pioneer and political activist who made his first moves on the scene during the 1970s.[102] On January 23, 2010, Jay-Z released a track, \"Stranded (Haiti Mon Amour)\", with Rihanna, and U2's Bono and The Edge, as well as performing it at the Hope For Haiti Now telethon.[103] In June 2010, Eminem and Jay-Z announced they would perform together in a pair of concerts in Detroit and New York. The event was dubbed The Home & Home Tour. The first two concerts rapidly sold out, prompting the scheduling of an additional show at each venue.[104] Jay-Z was the supporting act for U2 on the Australian and New Zealand leg of their U2 360° Tour, beginning in Auckland, New Zealand, in November 2010, followed by Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Perth in December.[105] Jay-Z also appeared on stage during U2 performances of \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\", and in Auckland also on a five-track EP entitled Watch the Throne, although it was later revealed by West that the project had become a full-length LP. Recording sessions for the album took place at various recording locations and began in November 2010. The first single released for the project was \"H•A•M\". The track was co-produced by Lex Luger and West himself. The track ended up being on the deluxe edition of the album. The follow-up to that was the second single \"Otis\", which premiered on Funkmaster Flex's Hot 97 radio show, and was later released to the iTunes Store eleven days later. The song's existence, along with several other tracks from the album, was confirmed during a listening session hosted by Jay-Z.[106] The album was first released on the iTunes Store, five days prior to its being released in physical format, a strategy Jay-Z later said was used to block an internet leak. It debuted at No. 1 on the iTunes Store in 23 countries. It also broke Coldplay's record for most albums sold in one week on the online retailer, selling 290,000 copies on iTunes alone. It held that record until Lil Wayne's Tha Carter IV was released twenty-one days later, selling 10,000 copies more. It debuted on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart at No. 1, selling 436,000 copies in its first week. The album received generally positive reviews. Jay-Z and West later gave a surprise performance of \"Otis\" at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards. Jay-Z collaborated with M.I.A on her single \"XXXO\", which achieved a fair level of success and went on to become remixed by several producers worldwide. In May 2012, Jay-Z and former Philadelphia mayor Michael A. Nutter announced Jay-Z as the curator and the headliner for the first annual \"Budweiser Made in America\" festival at Fairmount Park in Philadelphia on September 1 and 2, 2012. The performance was produced by Live Nation and assembled an eclectic lineup of \"rock, hip hop, R&B, Latin music and dance\" musicians.[107] Jay-Z and Rihanna were the two main headlining acts for BBC Radio 1's 2012 Hackney Weekend music festival on June 23 to 24.[108] Jay-Z opened his set with an appearance from Rihanna, they performed \"Run this Town\". On September 6, \"Clique\" was released, a single from the album \"Cruel Summer\", by GOOD Music. Kanye West and Big Sean starred alongside Jay-Z on the track. Jay-Z took the subway to his sold-out show at The Barclays Center on October 6, 2012.[109] On November 12, 2012, Coldplay announced that they will be playing with Jay-Z at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn on December 31.[110] On September 23, 2010, Q-Tip confirmed working on Jay-Z's follow-up album to The Blueprint 3, saying the album was to hit stores by spring 2011.[111] In May 2012 it was reported that Jay-Z would work on new music with Roc Nation producer Jahlil Beats. Beats told XXL magazine: \"Me and Jay-Z been going back and forth. He picked a couple of my joints that he's working on. I don't even wanna say too much about Jay, but we definitely working on some stuff. I haven't even sent him a bunch of beats. I sent him my favorite stuff. He hit me right back like, 'Yo, I'ma go in on this,' or, 'I like this.'\"[112] The album has been named one of the most anticipated albums of 2013 by Complex Magazine, MTV, and XXL. Production will come from Jahlil Beats, Kanye West, Rick Rubin, Swizz Beatz, Timbaland, and Pharrell Williams.[113][114] Jay-Z also made an appearance on Justin Timberlake's comeback single \"Suit & Tie\" from his third studio album The 20/20 Experience, the song itself was produced by both Jay-Z and Timberlake's mutual friend, Timbaland.[115] Timberlake and Jay-Z embarked on the co-headlining Legends of the Summer Stadium Tour.[116] During the fifth game of the 2013 NBA Finals, Carter announced his twelfth studio album, Magna Carta Holy Grail, and was released on July 4, 2013. Not long after, Jay-Z confirmed that the hyphen in his stage name would be left out and officially stylized in all capital letters.[117] Magna Carta Holy Grail debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and sold 528,000 copies in its first week, which bypassed its predicted debut in the range of 350,000 to 400,000.[118] In December 2013, it was announced that Jay-Z had received nine nominations at the 2014 Grammy Awards, more than any other artist.[119] Jay-Z appeared on his wife Beyoncé's self-titled fifth studio album, Beyoncé, with a feature on the song \"Drunk in Love\". They performed this song together at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards opening.[120] The song and its accompanying album would later win three Grammy Awards including Best R&B Performance at the 2015 ceremony. In 2016, he won a lawsuit for the song \"Made in America\" with Kanye West featuring Frank Ocean against Joel McDonald.[121] In early June 2017, posters were displayed in New York City and Los Angeles, and banner ads were placed on the Internet promoting a Tidal-related project titled 4:44.[122] A teaser ad was aired during the NBA Finals on June 7 featuring actors Mahershala Ali, Lupita Nyong'o and Danny Glover in a one-minute video, ending in \"4:44 – 6.30.17, Exclusively on Tidal\".

Ten days later, at their final London performance, the pair unveiled Everything Is Love, their much-awaited joint studio album, credited under the name The Carters. The pair also released the video for the album's lead single, \"Apeshit\", on Beyoncé's official YouTube channel.[125][126] The song won two awards from eight nominations at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards.[127] In 2021, Jay-Z was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame along with fellow rapper LL Cool J.[128][129] He also appeared on the song \"Jail\" on Kanye West's 2021 album Donda,[130] which went on to win Grammy Award for Best Rap Song at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards[131] and on the song \"Love All\" from Drake's 2021 album Certified Lover Boy.[132] In 2022, his first feature was a collaboration with fellow rapper Pusha T, \"Neck & Wrist\" featuring Pharrell Williams from Pusha T's album, It's Almost Dry.[133] His feature was succeeded by a four-minute guest appearance on DJ Khaled's album title track, \"God Did\".[134][135] He also was awarded the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Special (Live), as a producer for the Super Bowl LVI halftime show.[136] Jay-Z says his earliest exposure to music was through his parents' record collection, which was mostly of soul artists such as Marvin Gaye and Donny Hathaway. He says \"I grew up around music, listening to all types of people... I'm into music that has soul in it, whether it be rap, R&B, pop music, whatever. As long as I can feel their soul through the wax, that's what I really listen to.\"[137] He often uses excerpts from these artists as samples in his work, particularly in the Kanye West productions included on The Blueprint.[137] Known for his lyrical prowess which often utilises double entendres, witty wordplays, and mixes messages with braggadocio, his music often describes his rise from poverty to vast wealth.[138][139][140][141][142] Royce da 5'9\" and Fredro Starr of Onyx both describe Jay-Z's emphasis on flow in the book How to Rap—Starr says that Jay-Z is \"a master of the flow—he can flow fast, he can flow slow\".[143] The book describes how Jay-Z uses 'rests' to provide structure to a verse[144] and how he uses 'partial linking' to add more rhymes to a verse.[145] Jay-Z's early style is described by Vibe as \"a distinctly Das EFX-type, stiggety style\" on his 12\" single \"Can't Get With That\",[146] referring to the fast rhythms and vocal delivery of the group Das EFX. He is also known to write lyrics in his head, as described by Pusha T of Clipse in How to Rap,[147] a style popular with many MCs such as The Notorious B.I.G.,[147] Everlast,[148] Bobby Creekwater[149] and Guerilla Black.[149] Shock G of Digital Underground describes Jay-Z's live performance style, saying he \"rarely breaks a sweat, and instead uses smoothness and clever wordplay to keep the audience interested and entertained\".[150] Jay-Z's fast rapping technique, also known as the \"triplet rhyme\", was developed during his early years of creating music with former mentor Jaz-O.[151][152] Jay-Z has also established himself as a successful entrepreneur with a business empire spanning a variety of industries from clothing lines, beverages, real estate, sport teams, and record labels.[153] In an interview, he stated that \"my brands are an extension of me. They're close to me. It's not like running GM, where there's no emotional attachment.\"[154] Jay-Z and Damon Dash are the founders of the urban clothing brand Rocawear.[155] Rocawear has clothing lines and accessories for men, women and children. The line was taken over by Jay-Z in early 2006 following a falling out with Dash. In March 2007, Jay-Z sold the rights to the Rocawear brand to Iconix Brand Group for $204 million. He retains his stake in the company and continues to oversee the marketing, licensing and product development.[155][156] Jay-Z became the first rapper in Reebok's history to endorse the company's footwear, signing a three-year endorsement deal.[157] He later appeared in a 2003 Reebok collection advertising his S. Carter Collection.[158] Later that year, he and frenemy 50 Cent appeared in a commercial to promote their S. Carter and G-Unit footwears for the company, with a Just Blaze-produced song made for it.[159] In 2006, Jay-Z's deal with Reebok expired with no renewal.[157] In 2014, Jay-Z invested $200 million in Armand de Brignac champagne—owned at the time by Sovereign Brands, a New York–based wine and spirits company—for a 100 percent stake, making it the second alcoholic product acquisition in his financial investment portfolio.[160][161] The brand is known for its popularity with high-profile artists as being the gold bottles often referred to in media.[162][163][164][165][166] His ties to the company date back to 2006, and he received millions of dollars per year for his association with Armand de Brignac before he bought the entire company.[167] Jay-Z serves as co-brand director for Budweiser Select and collaborates with the company on strategic marketing programs and creative ad development. He provides direction on brand programs and ads that appear on TV, radio, print, and high-profile events.[168] In March 2015, Jay-Z completed the $56 million acquisition of Aspiro, a Norwegian media technology company that operates the subscription-based music streaming service Tidal, which has been in operation since October 2014.[169] The music service was acquired through his company Project Panther Bidco Ltd. (an entity indirectly owned by Jay-Z's S. Carter Enterprises a company holding interests in leading international music, media and entertainment companies).[170][171] The music service combines audio and music videos with curated editorial. The main idea of the service is to bring major revenue streams back to the music artists themselves as the idea of an artist-owned streaming platform was stated as to \"restore the value to music by launching a service owned by artists.\" Jay-Z currently[when?] is a major shareholder in the company.[172][173] In July 2015, Carter made a significant investment to JetSmarter, an app helping people book private executive plane flights. The app was built by Sergey Petrossov.[174] From 2005 to 2007, Jay-Z was inaugurated as the president of Def Jam Recordings. Under Jay-Z's leadership, Def Jam launched the successful careers of contemporary R&B singers Rihanna and Ne-Yo. At the end of 2007, after he released American Gangster, Jay-Z decided not to renew his contract as the president and CEO of Def Jam. Shortly after, he started his Live Nation venture, Roc Nation.[175] In April 2011, it was reported that Jay-Z had outbid executives at Universal Music and Jive Records to acquire independent record label Block Starz Music.[176][177] For a decade (2003–2013), Jay-Z enjoyed his role as a part-owner of the Brooklyn Nets NBA team, having paid a reported $1 million for his share, which declined in value to $350,000 in April 2013, based on Forbes magazine's valuation of the team.[178] He encouraged the team's relocation to Brooklyn's Barclays Center (from New Jersey) in the 2012–2013 season, at which point the team took on the Brooklyn Nets moniker.[179][180] On April 18, 2013, Jay-Z officially announced through his Life + Times website in a press release that he would be relinquishing his ownership in the Brooklyn Nets.[181] The shares were eventually sold to singer, rapper, actor and entrepreneur Will Pan, making Pan the first American of Taiwanese descent to own a U.S. professional sports franchise.[182][183] Jay-Z's cited Pan's athletic background (he was a team captain of his high school basketball team and played in college), his multitude of musical styles, his influence in the Taiwanese American community, and his business acumen and portfolio (including being the founder and chief executive of software company Camigo Media and a co-founder of streetwear boutique N.P.C [New Project Center]), as reasons why his bid was successful.[182][183] In September 2013, his stake in Barclays Center was sold for $1.5 million.[184] On April 2, 2013, ESPN reported Jay-Z's plans to launch his own sports agency, Roc Nation Sports, with a focus on the representation of various professional athletes. The sport management group is a partnership with Creative Artists Agency.[185] In conjunction with the agency's launch, New York Yankees's second baseman Robinson Canó left agent Scott Boras to sign with the company. ESPN also mentioned that Jay-Z himself was planning to be a certified sports agent, first in baseball and eventually in basketball and football. In order to represent clients in basketball, he would have to give up his small share of the Brooklyn Nets.[185][186] In October 2005, he was reported in English media as considering buying a stake of Arsenal F.C., an English soccer team.[187] Through his conglomerate company Gain Global Investments Network LLC, he had an interest estimated between 2 and 7% in the Aqueduct Entertainment Group (AEG) consortium, which in January 2010 was awarded a contract to operate a 4,500-slot-machine racino at the Aqueduct Race Track. Jay-Z became interested in the project after New York Governor David Paterson who awarded the contract said there had to be an affirmative action component to the ownership. Jay-Z was initially approached by casino mogul Steve Wynn, who was also bidding on the contract. On March 9, 2010, Jay-Z and Flake withdrew from the project, and Paterson recused himself from further involvement.[188][189] On April 5, 2011, Jay-Z launched the popular culture and lifestyle online magazine Life + Times. It features content that showcases his high-end tastes in clothing, appliances, and cars. The site design is aesthetically aimed at the upwardly mobile young male demographic, with sports and music-related posts accompanying those about fashion and design.[190] Among the music content is the Decoded series, originating from Jay-Z's memoir of the same name and featuring a select rapper deciphering their own lyrics.[191] In January 2015, after being contacted by the webzine, the DJ and radio host Funkmaster Flex revealed that he had been contacted in 2013 for a story about a digital app he made at the time, but alleged that the information was instead used to help launch the Magna Carta Samsung app for the release of Jay-Z's album of the same name. \"But I was good with that. I ate that. Everybody's out here hustling\", Flex reasoned to Vibe.[192] In 2016, he signed a two-year exclusive film and TV Deal with Weinstein Company and with the deal gives them first-look options to create scripted and unscripted TV projects and film projects, and those projects were in works.[193] As part of his deal with Weinstein company, he produced a documentary series on the life of Kalief Browder who was imprisoned for three years and committed suicide upon his release. He also addressed racial profiling and police brutality in a conscious manner.[194] Jay-Z also co-owns the 40/40 Club, an upscale sports bar that started in New York City, and has since expanded to Atlantic City and Chicago. In 2008, the 40/40 Club in Las Vegas was closed down and bought back by the hotel after attendance steadily declined.[195] In 2005, Jay-Z became an investor in Carol's Daughter, a line of beauty products, including products for hair, skin, and hands.[196] In 2010, he announced plans to expand his 40/40 Club sports bar chain into as many as 20 airports, joining his Roc Nation business partners, husband and wife Juan and Desiree Perez, in a deal with Delaware North.[197] On November 16, 2010, Jay-Z published a memoir entitled Decoded.[198][199] The memoir was co-signed by Dream Hampton.[200] Parlux fragrances sued Jay-Z for $18 million for the failure of his cologne, Gold. They claim the cologne's failure is due to Jay-Z not doing social media posts and interviews about the cologne. Parlux claims they projected selling $15 million the first year, and $35 million the second, and subsequent years after the launch. The fragrance sold $14 million the first year and $6.1 million the second.[201] Parlux lost money on the venture and have had constant returns of unsold inventory.[202] Jay-Z collaborated with Cohiba to launch his own cigars.[203] In August 2020, Jay-Z's Roc Nation partnered with Brooklyn's Long Island University to establish the Roc Nation School of Music, Sports & Entertainment.[204] In November 2020, it was announced that Jay-Z would be join TPCO Holding Corp., a newly formed cannabis products company, in the role of \"Chief Visionary Officer\".[205] On December 5, 2022, Jay-Z and the Roc Nation announced their partnership with Caesars Entertainment to build and operate a casino property at Times Square.[206] In 2002, Jay-Z and singer Beyoncé collaborated on the song \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\". He also appeared on Beyoncé's hit single, \"Crazy in Love\" the following year, as well as the song \"That's How You Like It\" from her debut album Dangerously in Love (2003). On her second album, B'Day, he made appearances on the hits \"Déjà Vu\" and \"Upgrade U\". In the video for the latter song, she comically imitates his appearance.[207] They kept a low profile while dating, and were married on April 4, 2008, in a private ceremony in Tribeca, New York City.[208] Their relationship became a matter of public record on April 22, 2008,[209] although Beyoncé did not publicly debut her US$5 million Lorraine Schwartz-designed wedding ring until the Fashion Rocks concert on September 5, 2008.[210] Since their marriage, they generally avoid discussing their relationship,[211] and Beyoncé has stated her belief that this has helped them, while Jay-Z agreed in a People article that they do not \"play with [their] relationship\".[212] In 2006, Beyoncé and Jay-Z were listed as the most powerful couple for Time magazine's 100 most influential people.[213] In January 2009, Forbes ranked them as Hollywood's top-earning couple, with a combined total of $162 million.[214] They made it to the top of the list the following year, with a combined total of US$122 million between June 2008 and June 2009.[214] At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Beyoncé revealed that she was pregnant with their first child.[215][216] Their daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, was born at New York's Lenox Hill Hospital on January 7, 2012.[217] Jay-Z released \"Glory\", a song dedicated to Blue Ivy, through his Life+Times website on January 9, 2012.[218] The song, produced by frequent collaborators the Neptunes, detailed the couple's pregnancy struggles, including a miscarriage Beyoncé had suffered.[218] Blue Ivy's cries were included at the end of the song, and she was officially credited on the song as \"B.I.C\"; she became the youngest person in Billboard history (at two days old) have a chart entry when \"Glory\" debuted at No. 74 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs.[219] On June 18, 2017, Beyoncé's father Mathew Knowles confirmed that she had given birth to twins with Jay-Z, a daughter named Rumi and a son named Sir.[220] In the following months, they purchased a US$88 million home in the Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles.[221] In 2023, the couple bought a house in Malibu, California, designed by the architect Tadao Ando, for $200 million. It established a record for the most expensive residence sold in California.[222] On December 2, 1999, Jay-Z, who had come to believe that record executive Lance \"Un\" Rivera was behind the bootlegging of Vol. 3..., allegedly stabbed him at the Kit Kat Klub, a now-defunct night club in Times Square, New York City, during a release party for Q-Tip's album Amplified.[223] Jay-Z's associates at the party were accused of causing a commotion within the club, which Jay-Z allegedly used as cover while he stabbed Rivera in the stomach with a five-inch (127 mm) blade.[224] He surrendered to police the following evening and was placed under arrest, although he was soon released on $50,000 bail.[225][226] When he was indicted in Manhattan Criminal Court in late January 2000, he pleaded not guilty; he and his lawyers contended that they had witnesses and videotapes proving he had been nowhere near Rivera during the incident. Nevertheless, he later pleaded guilty to third-degree assault and accepted a three-year probation sentence.[227] Jay-Z later addressed the case in his 2010 book Decoded: One night I went to Q-Tip's solo album release party and at some point in the night, I ran into the guy everyone's been telling me is behind the bootleg. So I approached him. When I told him what I suspected, to my surprise, he got real loud with me right there in the middle of the club. It was strange. We separated and I went over to the bar. I was sitting there like, \"No the fuck this nigga did not...\" I was talking to people, but I was really talking to myself out loud, just in a state of shock. Before I even realized what I was doing, I headed back over to him, but this time I was blacking out with anger. The next thing I knew, all hell had broken loose in the club. That night the guy went straight to the police and I was indicted. [...] There was no reason to put my life on the line, and the lives of everyone who depends on me, because of a momentary loss of control. [...] I vowed to never allow myself to be in a situation like that again.[228] In 2023, Rivera stated that Jay-Z lied, and was not the one that stabbed him: \"No. Jay-Z was not the guy that actually stabbed me that night (...) it's never been his history\".[229][230][231] In December 2024, Jay-Z, along with Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, was accused in a civil lawsuit of raping a 13-year-old girl at an MTV Video Music Awards after-party in 2000. Jay-Z denied the allegations and described it as a blackmail attempt.[232] Jay-Z responded to the plaintif's lawyer Tony Buzbee on social media that \"No sir, it had the opposite effect! It made me want to expose you for the fraud you are in a VERY public fashion. So no, I will not give you ONE RED PENNY!!\"[citation needed] Combs' legal team described this allegation as another in a long line of lies about Combs.[233] On 9 December, Jay-Z filed both a motion requesting that the accuser identify themself and a lawsuit against the accuser's attorney.[234] During his first retirement from music,[failed verification] Jay-Z became involved in philanthropy.

                "content": "Shawn Corey Carter (born December 4, 1969), known professionally as Jay-Z (stylized as JAY-Z),[a] is an American rapper, songwriter, record producer, record executive, actor, and entrepreneur. He is the former CEO of Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records. Jay-Z co-owns The 40/40 Club and the Brooklyn Nets NBA team. He is one of the most financially successful hip-hop artists and businessmen in America.[8] Jay-Z has several nicknames, \"Jigga\", \"Hova\" and \"El Presidente\". In June 2019, it was reported that Jay-Z had become the first billionaire rapper.[9] Jay-Z was born as Shawn Corey Carter in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. He was raised in Marcy Houses, a housing project in Brooklyn's Bedford–Stuyvesant. After their father Adnis Reeves abandoned the family, Jay-Z and his three siblings were raised by their mother, Gloria Carter. Reeves would later meet and reconcile with Jay-Z shortly before dying in 2003. Jay-Z claims in his lyrics that in 1982, at age 12, he shot his older brother in the shoulder for stealing his jewelry. Along with rapper AZ he attended Eli Whitney High School in Brooklyn until it was closed. He then attended nearby George Westinghouse Career and Technical Education High School with rappers The Notorious B.I.G. and Busta Rhymes, followed by a stint at Trenton Central High School in Trenton, New Jersey, though he did not graduate. According to his interviews and lyrics, he sold crack cocaine and was shot at three times during this period. According to his mother, Jay-Z used to wake up his siblings at night banging out drum patterns on the kitchen table. She bought him a boombox for his birthday, sparking his interest in music, and he began freestyling and writing lyrics. Known as \"Jazzy\" around the neighborhood, he later adopted the stage name \"Jay-Z\" in homage to his mentor Jaz-O. Jay-Z can be briefly heard on several of Jaz-O's early recordings in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including \"H. P. Gets Busy\", \"The Originators\" and \"Hawaiian Sophie\". Jay-Z became embroiled in several battles with rapper LL Cool J in the early 1990s. He first became known to a wide audience on the posse cut \"Show and Prove\" on the 1994 Big Daddy Kane album Daddy's Home. Jay-Z has been referred to as Big Daddy Kane's hype man during this period, although Kane explains that he did not fill the traditional hype man role, and was instead basically making cameo appearances on stage. \"When I would leave the stage to go change outfits, I would bring out Jay-Z and Positive K and let them freestyle until I came back to the stage.\" The young Jay-Z appeared on a popular song by Big L, \"Da Graveyard\", and on Mic Geronimo's \"Time to Build\", which also featured early appearances by DMX and Ja Rule in 1995. His first official rap single was called \"In My Lifetime\", for which he released a music video in 1995. An unreleased music video was also produced for the B-side \"I Can't Get with That.\" In 2003, Jay-Z stopped rapping, because he found that there were not enough good rappers to compete with him. He said that the game was too easy for him. He decided to concentrate more on his producer career than his rap career. He became the president of Def Jam Recordings. He signed a lot of great artists such as Rihanna, Ne-Yo and Kanye West. He also became a businessman by creating his own clothing company, Rocawear, and owning a part of the Brooklyn Nets, an NBA basketball team. After a step back in his career, he made a decision in 2006 to come back into the game. He created the albums \"Kingdom Came\" and the year after \"American Gangster\". In 2009, he released Blue print 3, but in 2011 he teamed up with Kanye West to do an LP called Watch the Throne. This album went triple hit, made the top rap charts for August and also nominated for the Grammy for the best rap Album. Now, he is known to be one of the best rappers of all time. In April 2011 Jay-Z started a website called Life+ Times. He also took part in Barack Obama’s last elections.[10] Jay-Z's twelfth album, Magna Carta Holy Grail, was released in July 2013. The album topped the chart to number one. It was nominated for Album of the Year at the 2013 BET Hip Hop Awards. The first single on the album, \"Holy Grail\", features Justin Timberlake singing in it. It reached number four on the US Billboard 100.[11] In South Korea it reached number one. Jay-Z's wife Beyoncé sings on \"Part II (On the Run)\". In December 2013 Jay-Z was nominated for nine Grammy Awards. This was more than anyone else that year.[12] He rapped on his wife Beyoncé Knowles' fifth album Beyoncé. Together with Beyoncé, Jay-Z has three children: daughter Blue Ivy (born January 7th, 2012)[13] and twins Rumi and Sir Carter.[14] JAY-Z has released the following albums during his career:",

As the rapper tells it, in grade school, he found something of an escape in language. He’s mentioned this in interviews throughout his career, most recently telling David Letterman, “I had a sixth-grade teacher. Her name was Ms. Lowden, and I just loved the class so much.

                "title": "Rapid Recap: Bears fall to 49ers in San Francisco",
                "content": "Senior Writer SANTA CLARA, Calif. – The 49ers defeated the Bears 38-13 Sunday at Levi's Stadium. In the first half, Brock Purdy completed 16 of 18 passes for 258 yards with two touchdowns and a 155.8 passer rating. He finished the game connecting on 20 of 25 passes for 325 yards and a 145.4 rating. Caleb Williams threw two TD passes to Rome Odunze in the second half. The first was a 4-yarder that capped a 16-play, 70-yard drive to open the third quarter, cutting the deficit to 24-6. The second was a 14-yarder that drew the Bears to within 31-13 with 11:48 remaining in the fourth period. After the game, Thomas Brown did not sugarcoat what happened in his first game as Bears interim head coach. \"I'll always be straightforward, honest and open about things that transpired,\" Brown said. \"We've got to do a better job of putting [in] a better game plan on both sides of the ball so we execute better. Obviously [I will] continue to challenge our guys to be at their best. Also encourage those guys and also demand that we still stay unified.\" Williams completed 17 of 23 passes for 134 yards and a 116.9 passer rating before being replaced by Tyson Bagent with 1:59 remaining. The rookie quarterback extended his streak without throwing an interception to 255 pass attempts, the most in history by a Bears quarterback and an NFL rookie. The 49ers offense was led by tight end George Kittle, who had six receptions for 151 yards. Jauan Jennings caught seven passes for 90 yards and two TDs. The 49ers opened the game with a 5-play, 70-yard drive capped by Purdy's 7-yard touchdown pass to Jennings, giving San Francisco a 7-0 lead. Purdy completed 4 of 4 passes for 70 yards on the 5-play, 70-yard drive. The 49ers increased their lead to 14-0 on Isaac Guerendo's 1-yard touchdown run with 1:39 left in the first quarter. Guerendo, a rookie fourth-round pick, made his first NFL start Sunday, after Christian McCaffrey and Jordan Mason sustained season-ending injuries last Sunday night in a loss to the Bills. San Francisco extended its lead to 21-0 on Purdy's 16-yard TD pass to Jennings midway through the second quarter and made it 24-0 on Jake Moody's 23-yard field goal with 1:50 left in the first half. \"It's a grown man's business,\" Brown said. \"There is no lay down or quit in our football team, which I do love. But we've got to do a better job of trying to find ways of starting the games faster, particularly on the offensive side of the ball.\" \"It's not something that you want to do because that puts you behind in games,\" Williams said. \"When you're behind in games, which we've been in a couple of these past games, you've got to come back and it's a taller task … If you can get out and jump on people and these teams and impose your will, that's obviously what you want to do early in games and we haven't been doing that.\" After the Bears closed the gap to 24-6, the 49ers widened the margin to 31-6 on Guerendo's 4-yard TD run on the first play of the fourth quarter. After Odunze's second TD, San Francisco increased its lead to 38-13 on running back Patrick Taylor Jr.'s 3-yard TD run with 5:15 to play. With the loss, the Bears fell to 4-9. Their next game will be played a week from Monday night against the Vikings in Minneapolis. Check out the action as the Bears battle the San Francisco 49ers at Levi's Stadium. Bears rookie Caleb Williams threw three touchdown passes in the second half Thanksgiving Day in Detroit, but it wasn't enough to overcome a 16-0 halftime deficit in a 23-20 loss to the Lions. The Bears rallied in dramatic fashion to force overtime Sunday at Soldier Field, but the Vikings escaped with a 30-27 victory. The Bears nearly pulled off a remarkable comeback win over the rival Packers Sunday at Soldier Field. But Cairo Santos' 46-yard field goal attempt was blocked as time expired, enabling Green Bay to escape with a 20-19 victory. The Bears were held out of the end zone and generated only 142 yards of offense in a 19-3 loss to the Patriots Sunday at Soldier Field. The Bears were held out of the end zone and allowed 213 rushing yards in a 29-9 loss to the Cardinals Sunday in Arizona. After the Bears overcame a 12-point second-half deficit to take the lead with :25 remaining, Washington's 52-yard Hail Mary as time expired gave the Commanders an 18-15 victory Sunday at Northwest Stadium. Caleb Williams threw a career-high four touchdown passes—two to Cole Kmet and two to Keenan Allen—to lead the Bears to an exciting 35-16 win over the Jaguars Sunday at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. A breakout performance by the offense and another stifling effort by the defense led the Bears to a dominant 36-10 win over the Panthers Sunday at Soldier Field. The defense allowed only one touchdown and running back D'Andre Swift generated 165 yards from scrimmage and a TD in leading the Bears to a 24-18 win over the Los Angeles Rams Sunday at Soldier Field. The Bears scored their only two touchdowns of Sunday's game against the Colts in the fourth quarter but couldn't overcome another double-digit deficit in a 21-16 loss at Lucas Oil Stadium. The Bears fell behind by double digits Sunday night in Houston for the second straight game. But unlike last weekend's exciting comeback win over the Titans, they were unable to mount a rally in a 19-13 loss to the Texans. © Chicago Bears. All rights reserved.",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) After weeks of shaky play, the San Francisco 49ers got back to their old form with one of the most dominant first halves in years. Brock Purdy threw for 325 yards and two touchdowns and the 49ers bounced back from two blowout losses to beat Chicago 38-13 on Sunday and spoil interim coach Thomas Brown's debut for the Bears. “We just got back to being us, honestly,” linebacker Fred Warner said. “The product we were putting on the field the last couple weeks just wasn’t us. We knew that. We had a great opportunity this week to come out at home and right those wrongs and get back to playing our style and what we do best.” The 49ers (6-7) had been outscored by 53 points the past two weeks in losses at Green Bay and Buffalo that left their playoff hopes teetering with several stars such as Christian McCaffrey, Nick Bosa and Trent Williams sidelined by injuries. That prompted coach Kyle Shanahan to have Purdy and cornerback Deommodore Lenoir address the team at a meeting Saturday night that resonated with the team. “The message was we need to play with more of a sense of urgency and play desperate,” tight end George Kittle said. “Because you just hadn't really sensed that.” But San Francisco delivered a performance more reminiscent of a year ago when the Niners went to the Super Bowl, handing the Bears (4-9) their seventh straight loss after outgaining them by 315 yards on the way to a 24-0 halftime lead. Purdy delivered his third 300-yard passing game of the season with two TDs to Jauan Jennings, fill-in back Isaac Guerendo gained 128 yards from scrimmage and scored on two TD runs and Kittle had six catches for 151 yards. That helped deliver the highest-scoring game of the season for the 49ers. “I think we just all executed, did our job and kept it simple,” Purdy said. “I think guys weren’t overthinking anything. Just whatever was called we trusted in Kyle and executed.” The defense did the rest with strong pressure from the four-man line that led to rookie Caleb Williams getting sacked seven times. The Bears were looking for an emotional boost from the first in-season firing of a head coach in franchise history after letting Matt Eberflus go following a late-game clock mismanagement on Thanksgiving at Detroit. Instead they came up on the short end of one of the most lopsided first halves in recent memory. Chicago was outgained 319-4 in the first half for the ninth-largest discrepancy since 1991, managed only one first down and trailed by 24 points at the break. The Bears allowed Purdy and the San Francisco offense to move down the field with little resistance with the Niners scoring three TDs and one field goal on their first five possessions. Chicago couldn't move the ball at all on offense, generating minus-3 yards passing thanks to four sacks and losing 37 yards on five failed third down attempts. “We got our ass kicked today,” Williams said. “There’s no way around it. We got it handed to us. Offense, defense special teams, we have to come out and be better.\" Williams managed to throw two touchdown passes to Rome Odunze in the second half, but it was too late to get the Bears back into the game. Williams finished 17 for 34 for 134 yards and lost a fumble, but had his seventh straight start without an interception. Williams’ 56 sacks this season are the most for any Chicago quarterback since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger. Bears: Returner DeAndre Carter (hamstring) left in the first quarter and didn't return. ... RB Travis Homer (head) left the game in the second half. 49ers: Guerendo left the game in the fourth quarter with a foot injury. Shanahan said the team would know more about the severity on Monday. ... LG Ben Bartch (high ankle sprain) left the game in the first half and didn't return. Bartch was starting in place of the injured Aaron Banks and the Niners were forced to use third-stringer Spencer Burford the rest of the way.

                "title": "San Francisco 49ers 38, Chicago Bears 13: Grades",
                "content": "SANTA CLARA -- The San Francisco 49ers just kept their season alive with a 38-13 statement win over the Chicago Bears. Here are the 49ers' grades for this performance. One of the best performances of Brock Purdy's career. He hit 80 percent of his throws, completed passes to seven different receivers, threw for 325 yards and 2 touchdowns and posted a passer rating of 145.4. Finally, he stopped forcing passes to Deebo Samuel, who has been killing the 49ers' offense all season (more on him in a minute). Instead, Purdy threw six passes to George Kittle and eight passes to Jauan Jennings. Those are the two best receivers on the team and they should have been featured consistently this year. Last week, Kittle caught just one pass. Afterward, Purdy said his progressions didn't take him to Kittle. With all due respect, screw your progressions, Brock. Find your best players. And that's exactly what he did today. He's growing up. And now he has four more games to show he's worth a multi-year contract that will make him one of the highest-paid players in the NFL. No offense to Christian McCaffrey, but the 49ers are better without him this season. In four games with him, they averaged just 15 points per game. In 9 games without him, the 49ers are averaging 27.6 points per game. And that's because the 49ers get all of their playmakers involved when McCaffrey is out. Today, Isaac Guerendo started the first game of his career and scored two touchdowns. He also had a 30-yard run, a 27-yard catch and a 23-yard catch. He's a big play waiting to happen and he should have had a role in the offense all season. Unfortunately for the 49ers, he left the game with a foot injury after 15 carries. Perhaps he couldn't handle such a big work load. His replacement, Patrick Taylor Jr., gained just 25 yards on 7 carries. The 49ers need Guerendo to play this Thursday against the Rams. Two targets, one catch, three yards. But hey, at least he didn't fumble at the goal line like last week. Jauan Jennings was outstanding -- seven catches for 90 yards and 2 touchdowns. He deserves another contract extension. He already has outperformed the two-year deal the 49ers gave him this offseason. His counterpart, Deebo Samuel, was terrible once again -- three targets, two catches, 22 receiving yards plus five carries for a measly 13 rushing yards. The 49ers averaged just 4.4 yards per play when they handed the ball or threw it to Samuel, and a whopping 7.9 yards per play when they handed it or threw it to anyone else. The 49ers should have traded Samuel this past offseason. Instead, they restructured his contract in a way that will make him incredibly difficult to trade or release this coming offseason. Oops. One of the best games of George Kittle's career. He had six catches for 151 yards. Last week, he had one catch for 7 yards. Afterward, he told the media he hardly ran any routes and that he was open the few times he didn't have to block. Message received. Suddenly, Kyle Shanahan was calling all kinds of exotic screens and play-action passes for Kittle. Shanahan should do that every week. Kittle is the greatest tight end in franchise history and somehow he's still in his prime. They didn't block particularly well in the run game, but they didn't have Trent Williams, Aaron Banks or Ben Bartch and they still gave up just one sack. That's impressive. Yetur Gross-Matos sacked Caleb Williams three times, Leonard Floyd sacked him twice and Maliek Collins sacked him once. The 49ers needed these three to step up while Nick Bosa is out and they did. They held Bears running back D'Andre Swift to just 38 rushing yards and gave up zero rushing touchdowns. And next week, they most likely will get Dre Greenlaw back. Good news. They gave up two touchdown passes and a quarterback rating of 116.9, but they also gave up just 134 yards through the air. Plus Talanoa Hufanga returned from a wrist injury and the 49ers defense improved dramatically with him on the field. The 49ers need to find a way to re-sign him this offseason. He's the biggest playmaker in their secondary even when he's playing with just one hand. Jake Moody didn't miss any field goals but he kicked two kickoffs short of the 20-yard line, which is a penalty. He needs to go this offseason. Finally, Kyle Shanahan did the things we've been begging him to do all season: he stopped playing Kyle Juszczyk so much and instead mostly used one-back formations, he spread the ball around on offense and he called lots of screens and play-action passes which gave Brock Purdy plenty of easy throws. Where was this Kyle Shanahan all season? It seems like McCaffrey's knee injury may have brought the best out of Shanahan because he finally accepted that McCaffrey won't save him and the team this season and that he needs to build an offensive identity without him. And the offensive identity is a diverse, balanced attack featuring Kittle and Jennings, not Samuel and McCaffrey. If only Shanahan had this epiphany in September, the 49ers might not be 6-7. Now let's see if he can keep it up this Thursday against the Rams, who beat the Bills today. The Bears are sorry team that has lost seven games in a row while the Rams have won five of their past seven. The 49ers will need another a-plus performance from Shanahan to win.

                "title": "49ers Rout the Bears at Levi's® Stadium; Five Takeaways from #CHIvsSF",
                "content": "Team Reporter The San Francisco 49ers returned home after a couple of tough road games to host the Chicago Bears (4-8). For a third-straight week, the team was without a couple of key starters in defensive lineman Nick Bosa (hip/oblique) and left tackle Trent Williams (ankle), and Sunday marked back-to-back games without starting left guard Aaron Banks (concussion). Despite missing important personnel, the red and gold took control of this game early and never surrendered the lead, routing the Chicago Bears 38-13. Here are five takeaways from the Bears-49ers game: The Rookie Running Back Gets First-Career Start With both Christian McCaffrey and Jordan Mason landing on the Injured Reserve list in Week 14, rookie Isaac Guerendo was tasked with leading the 49ers ground game versus the Bears. San Francisco's fourth-rounder wasted no time making his presence known, hauling in a 23-yard catch on the opening drive and coming down with a 27-yard reception on the third drive to set up his own one-yard score on the next play. He punched in a second touchdown, a four-yarder to open up the fourth quarter and extend the lead 31-13. JJ Finds the End Zone First Wide receiver Jauan Jennings recorded the third multi-touchdown game of his career in Week 14. Jennings caught seven passes for 90 yards and two touchdowns on Sunday afternoon. His second target of the day was a seven-yard touchdown pass to the left corner of the end zone to cap off the 49ers five-play, 70-yard opening drive. To get the fans really hyped, Jennings celebrated with a Levi's® Leap (leaped into the crowd in the north end zone). He added another score midway through the second quarter, connecting with Purdy in the red zone for a 16-yard catch-and-run TD. He added a little Jennings flare by diving in for pay dirt. Defensive Line Breakdown Bears quarterback Caleb Williams entered Sunday as the most sacked QB in the league, and the 49ers defensive line added another four to the count in Week 14. Yetur Gross-Matos, Leonard Floyd and Maliek Collins all got home on Williams for a combined loss of 30 yards. The first four sacks of the day came on third downs and helped the 49ers defensive unit force three-and-outs on four of the Bears five offensive possessions in the first half. The D-line added another splash play in the third quarter when Evan Anderson recovered the ball that came out of Williams' hand behind the line of scrimmage. San Francisco was able to take over at their own 38-yard line, and Guerendo punched in a four-yard score on the ensuing drive. Gross-Matos struck again in the fourth quarter in back-to-back plays for a total loss of eight yards on the second to last of Chicago's offensive possessions. The People's Tight End Continues to Climb the Charts Tight end George Kittle finds himself in a new exclusive club after logging six catches for 151 yards against the Bears. It was actually following his third catch of the day, a 23-yarder to open up the second quarter that Kittle joined Hall of Fame tight end Antonio Gates and tight end Travis Kelce as the third tight end in NFL history to register 500-plus catches and 7,000-plus yards in his first eight seasons. His 151 yards on the day also made him San Francisco's current receiving yards leader. Injuries of the Game The San Francisco 49ers dropped their Week 13 matchup 35-10 to the Buffalo Bills.

                "content": "See text Eagle is the common name for the golden eagle, bald eagle, and other birds of prey in the family of the Accipitridae. Eagles belong to several groups of genera, some of which are closely related. True eagles comprise the genus Aquila. Most of the 68 species of eagles are from Eurasia and Africa.[1] Outside this area, just 14 species can be found—two in North America, nine in Central and South America, and three in Australia. Eagles are not a natural group but denote essentially any kind of bird of prey large enough to hunt sizeable (about 50 cm long or more overall) vertebrates. The word \"eagle\" is borrowed into English from Anglo-Norman: eagle and Middle French: aigle, both derived ultimately from Latin: aquila (\"eagle\"). It is cognate with terms such as French: aigle, Portuguese: águia and Spanish: águila.[2] It is broadly synonymous with the less common English term \"erne\" or \"earn\", deriving from Middle English: ern, from Old English: earn, in which it acts as the usual word for the bird. The Old English term is turn derived from Proto-Germanic: *arnuz and is cognate with other synonymous words in Germanic languages such as Swedish: örn, German: Aar and Gothic: ara. Through the Proto-Indo-European root, it is further related to words such as Greek: ὄρνις (\"bird\") and Lithuanian: erelis (\"eagle\"). Although \"erne\" can be used to refer to any eagle, it is most commonly used for the golden eagle or sea-eagle.[3][4] Eagles are large, powerfully-built birds of prey, with heavy heads and beaks. Even the smallest eagles, such as the booted eagle (Hieraaetus pennatus), which is comparable in size to a common buzzard (Buteo buteo) or red-tailed hawk (B. jamaicensis), have relatively longer and more evenly broad wings, and more direct, faster flight, despite the reduced size of their aerodynamic feathers. Most eagles are larger than any other raptors, apart from some vultures. The smallest species of eagle is the Great Nicobar serpent eagle (Spilornis klossi), at 450 g (1 lb) and 40 cm (16 in). The largest species are discussed below. Like all birds of prey, eagles have very large hooked beaks for ripping flesh from their prey, strong, muscular legs, and powerful talons. The beak is typically heavier than that of most other birds of prey. Eagles' eyes are extremely powerful. It is estimated that the wedge-tailed eagle has a visual acuity twice that of a typical human.[5][6][7] This acuity enables eagles to spot potential prey from a very long distance. This keen eyesight is primarily attributed to their extremely large pupils which ensure minimal diffraction (scattering) of the incoming light. Like most diurnal raptors, eagles have little ability to see ultraviolet light.[8] The female of all known species of eagles is larger than the male.[9][10] Eagles normally build their nests, called eyries, in tall trees or on high cliffs. Many species lay two eggs, but the older, larger chick frequently kills its younger sibling once it has hatched. The parents take no action to stop the killing.[11][12] It is said[by whom?] that eagles fly above clouds but this is not true.[citation needed] Eagles fly during storms and glide from the wind's pressure. This saves the bird's energy. Due to the size and power of many eagle species, they are ranked at the top of the food chain as apex predators in the avian world. The type of prey varies by genus. The Haliaeetus and Icthyophaga eagles prefer to capture fish, though the species in the former often capture various animals, especially other water birds, and are powerful kleptoparasites of other birds. The snake and serpent eagles of the genera Circaetus, Terathopius, and Spilornis predominantly prey on the great diversity of snakes found in the tropics of Africa and Asia. The eagles of the genus Aquila are often the top birds of prey in open habitats, taking almost any medium-sized vertebrate they can catch. Where Aquila eagles are absent, other eagles, such as the buteonine black-chested buzzard-eagle of South America, may assume the position of top raptorial predator in open areas. Many other eagles, including the species-rich genus Spizaetus, live predominantly in woodlands and forests. These eagles often target various arboreal or ground-dwelling mammals and birds, which are often unsuspectingly ambushed in such dense, knotty environments. Hunting techniques differ among the species and genera, with some individual eagles having engaged in quite varied techniques based on their environment and prey at any given time. Most eagles grab prey without landing and take flight with it, so the prey can be carried to a perch and torn apart.[13] The bald eagle is noted for having flown with the heaviest load verified to be carried by any flying bird, since one eagle flew with a 6.8 kg (15 lb) mule deer fawn.[14][15] However, a few eagles may target prey considerably heavier than themselves; such prey is too heavy to fly with, thus it is either eaten at the site of the kill or taken in pieces back to a perch or nest. Golden and crowned eagles have killed ungulates weighing up to 30 kg (66 lb) and a martial eagle even killed a 37 kg (82 lb) duiker, 7–8 times heavier than the preying eagle.[13][16] Authors on birds David Allen Sibley, Pete Dunne, and Clay Sutton described the behavioral difference between hunting eagles and other birds of prey thus (in this case the bald and golden eagles as compared to other North American raptors):[17] They have at least one singular characteristic. It has been observed that most birds of prey look back over their shoulders before striking prey (or shortly thereafter); predation is after all a two-edged sword. All hawks seem to have this habit, from the smallest kestrel to the largest Ferruginous – but not the Eagles. Among the eagles are some of the largest birds of prey: only the condors and some of the Old World vultures are markedly larger. It is regularly debated[according to whom?] which should be considered the largest species of eagle. They could be measured variously in total length, body mass, or wingspan. Different lifestyle needs among various eagles result in variable measurements from species to species. For example, many forest-dwelling eagles, including the very large harpy eagle, have relatively short wingspans, a feature necessary for being able to maneuver in quick, short bursts through densely forested habitats.[13] Eagles in the genus Aquila, found almost exclusively in open country, are noted for their ability to soar, and have relatively long wings for their size.[13] These lists of the top five eagles are based on weight, length, and wingspan, respectively. Unless otherwise noted by reference, the figures listed are the median reported for each measurement in the guide Raptors of the World[18] in which only measurements that could be personally verified by the authors were listed.[13] The eagles are generally distributed in all types of habitats and nearly all parts of the world. The birds can be found in northern tundra to tropical rainforests and deserts. In North America, bald eagles and golden eagles are very common. Eagles are often informally divided into four groups.[a][25] The snake eagles are placed in the subfamily Circaetinae. The fish eagles, booted eagles, and harpy eagles have traditionally been placed in the subfamily Buteoninae together with the buzzard-hawks (buteonine hawks) and harriers. Some authors may treat these groups as tribes of the Buteoninae; Lerner & Mindell[26] proposed separating the eagle groups into their own subfamilies of Accipitridae. Sea eagles or fish eagles take fish as a large part of their diets, either fresh or as carrion. Proposed subfamily Haliaeetinae. Genera: Haliaeetus, Icthyophaga. Some authors include Gypohierax angolensis, the \"vulturine fish eagle\" (also called the palm-nut vulture) in this group.[25] However, genetic analyses indicate it is related to a grouping of Neophron–Gypaetus–Eutriorchis (Egyptian vulture, bearded vulture (lammergeier), and Madagascar serpent eagle).[27] The fish eagles have a close genetic relationship with Haliastur and Milvus; the whole group is only distantly related to the Buteo group.[27] Fish eagles exist in every continent throughout the world, except for South America.[28] Although fish eagles can be found in many different places around the world, they have been classified as \"Near Threatened\". Reasons such as overfishing, pollution, habitat destruction, and the use of pesticides have contributed to the species' rapid population drop.[29] The booted eagle is a group of eagle that typically migrates across the Sahara Desert to Europe. It usually reaches Europe around the beginning of March and leaves by the end of September. It's interesting to note that these types of eagles usually mate with the same partner and return to the same areas years later. Female booted eagles usually lay 1-4 eggs, which promptly hatch after 37 to 40 days. Researchers estimate that there are between 3600 and 6900 pairs of booted eagles in Europe, which are mostly situated in the Iberian Peninsula.[30] Booted eagles or \"true eagles\"[25][31] have feathered tarsi (lower legs). Tribe Aquililae or proposed subfamily Aquilinae. Genera: Aquila, Hieraaetus; Spizaetus, Oroaetus, Spizastur; Nisaetus;[27] Ictinaetus, Lophoaetus; Polemaetus; and Stephanoaetus.[25][31] See comments under eagle species for changes to the composition of these genera. Most snake or serpent eagles, as the name suggests, primarily prey on snakes. Despite filling the niche of a snake eagle, genetic studies suggest that the Madagascar serpent eagle (Eutriorchis) is not related to them.[27] Over several decades, a great deal of research has been done on the Snake-eagle's diet, which is mainly made up of reptiles, especially snakes. When it comes to catching snakes, it is generally accepted that the bird exhibits generalist feeding behavior, which means it does not hunt down specific types of snakes but rather feeds on them depending on their availability in the wild.[32] Harpy eagles[25] or \"giant forest eagles\"[24] are large eagles that inhabit tropical forests. The group contains two to six species, depending on the author. Although these birds occupy similar niches and have traditionally been grouped, they are not all related: the solitary eagles are related to the black hawks and the Philippine eagle to the snake eagles. Major new research into eagle taxonomy suggests that the important genera Aquila and Hieraaetus are not composed of nearest relatives, and it is likely that a reclassification of these genera will soon take place, with some species being moved to Lophaetus or Ictinaetus.[26] Family Accipitridae The modern English term for the bird is derived from Latin: aquila by way of French: aigle. The origin of aquila is unknown, but it is believed to possibly derive from aquilus (meaning dark-colored, swarthy, or blackish) as a reference to the plumage of eagles. Old English used the term earn, related to Scandinavia's ørn/örn. It is similar to other Indo-European terms for \"bird\" or \"eagle\", including Greek: ὄρνις (ornís), Russian: орёл (orël), and Welsh: eryr. In the southern part of Finland, near the Gulf of Finland, is the town of Kotka, which literally means \"eagle\", while the town of L'Aquila in the central part of Italy literally means \"the eagle\". In Britain before 1678, eagle referred specifically to the golden eagle, with the other native species, the white-tailed eagle, being known as erne. The modern name \"golden eagle\" for aquila chrysaetos was introduced by the naturalist John Ray.[33] The village of Eagle in Lincolnshire, England, has nothing to do with the bird; its name is derived from the Old English words for \"oak\" and \"wood\" (compare Oakley).[34] In the ancient Sumerian mythology, the mythical king Etana was said to have been carried into heaven by an eagle.[35] Classical writers such as Lucan and Pliny the Elder claimed that the eagle was able to look directly at the sun, and that they forced their fledglings to do the same. Those that blinked would be cast from the nest. This belief persisted until the Medieval era.[36] The eagle is the patron animal of the ancient Greek god Zeus. In particular, Zeus was said to have taken the form of an eagle in order to abduct Ganymede, and there are numerous artistic depictions of the eagle Zeus bearing Ganymede aloft, from Classical times up to the present (see illustrations in the Ganymede (mythology) page.)[37] Eagles appear metaphorically in many translations of the Old Testament. God is spoken of as carrying Israel on \"eagles' wings\" in Exodus 19:4, Isaiah 40:31 compares those who wait on the Lord to flying eagles, and Psalm 103 mentions renewing one's youth \"as the eagle\". In explaining this rejuvenation, Augustine of Hippo says in his commentary on the Psalms that eagles' beaks overgrow as they age and that they break them against rocks to restore them.[38] The translation, however, is uncertain: the word in the Hebrew, נשר, can also be translated vulture,[39] and is listed alongside specific kinds of vulture in Leviticus' discussion of unclean animals. The eagle is also often used in Christian iconography to represent the Gospel of John,[40] and eagle-shaped lecterns are common in Anglican and some Roman Catholic churches.[41] The eagle was believed to be able to look directly into the sun in the same way that the Gospel of John looks directly at Jesus' divinity, and the great distances the eagle flies represent the spread of the gospel to the ends of the earth. The United States eagle feather law stipulates that only individuals of certifiable Native American ancestry enrolled in a federally recognized tribe are legally authorized to obtain eagle feathers for religious or spiritual reasons.[42] In Canada, the poaching of eagle feathers for the booming U.S. market has sometimes resulted in the arrests of First Nations person for the crime.[43] The Moche people of ancient Peru worshiped the eagle and often depicted eagles in their art.[44] The golden eagle was sacred to the Aztec god Huitzilopochtli while the harpy eagle was sacred to Quetzalcoatl.[45] Eagles are an exceptionally common symbol in heraldry, being considered the \"King of Birds\" in contrast to the lion, the \"King of Beasts\". Whereas the lion (e.g. England) usually represents authority, the eagle is the symbol of power. They are particularly popular in Germanic countries such as Austria, due to their association with the Holy Roman Empire. The eagle of the Holy Roman Empire was two-headed, supposedly representing the two divisions, East and West, of the old Roman Empire. This motif, derived from the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire was also adopted by the Russian Empire and is still featured in the Flag of Albania. The Roman eagle was preceded by the eagle of Ptolemaic Egypt and the Achaemenid Empire. In the coat of arms of Kotka, Finland, the eagle is depicted carrying an anchor and the caduceus on its feet. Heraldic eagles are most often found displayed, i.e. with their wings and legs extended. They can also occur close, i.e. with their wings folded, or rising, i.e. about to take flight. The heads, wings, and legs of eagles can also be found independently. Eagles symbolize strength, courage, and independence and are commonly found in the heraldry of many nations across the world. Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Austria, Dagestan, Egypt, Germany, Ghana, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Montenegro, Nigeria, Philippines, Poland, Palestine, Panama, Russia, Romania, Serbia, South Sudan, Somaliland, the United States of America, Yemen, Zambia, and Zimbabwe are the nations whose coats of arms feature an eagle. The eagle's continuing significance and worldwide appeal as a forceful symbol in national identity and imagery is demonstrated by its widespread usage.[46]",

                "content": "The Penn State Nittany Lions team represents the Pennsylvania State University in college football. The Nittany Lions compete in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision as a member of the Big Ten Conference, which they joined in 1993 after playing as an Independent from 1892 to 1992.[3][4][5] Established in 1887, the Nittany Lions have achieved numerous on-field successes, including two consensus national championships in 1982 and 1986; four Big Ten Conference Championships in 1994, 2005, 2008, and 2016; 13 undefeated seasons in 1887, 1894, 1909, 1911, 1912, 1920, 1921, 1947, 1968, 1969, 1973, 1986 and 1994; and 53 appearances in college bowl games, with an all-time post-season bowl record of 31–20–2. The team ranks seventh among NCAA Division I college football programs in all-time total wins.[6] The Nittany Lions play their home games at Beaver Stadium, located on-campus in University Park, Pennsylvania. The first recorded game in Penn State football history occurred on November 12, 1881, when Penn State traveled to Lewisburg, Pennsylvania to play Bucknell, known until 1886 as the University at Lewisburg. Penn State won 9–0, which was nine goals to none. At the time, this was really a game of \"American rugby\". The father of American football, Walter Camp, did not develop the \"scrimmage\", the \"first down\" and the \"gridiron\" (yard markings) until 1882. Although this game was reported in two State College newspapers and the Mirror (University at Lewisburg campus newspaper), Bucknell denies that this game ever happened. Penn State did not field teams from 1882 through 1886. Penn State played its first season in 1887,[7] but had no head coach for their first five years, from 1887 to 1891.[7] The teams played its home games on the Old Main lawn on campus in State College, Pennsylvania. They compiled a 12–8–1 record in these seasons, playing as an independent from 1887 to 1890. In 1891, the Pennsylvania Intercollegiate Football Association (PIFA) was formed. It consisted of Bucknell (University at Lewisburg), Dickinson, Franklin & Marshall, Haverford, Penn State and Swarthmore. Lafayette and Lehigh were excluded because it was felt they would dominate the Association. Penn State won the championship with a 4–1–0 record. Bucknell's record was 3–1–1 (losing to Franklin & Marshall and tying Dickinson). The Association was dissolved prior to the 1892 season.[7] George W. Hoskins was the first head football coach at Penn State.[8] He posted a 17–4–4 record in his from 1892 to 1895 as head coach, and his .760 winning percentage ranks highest in program history.[8] His first team played its home game on the Old Main lawn on campus in State College, Pennsylvania, before the 500-seat Beaver Field opened in 1893.[8] He was succeeded by Samuel B. Newton,[citation needed] who posted a 12–14 (.462) record in three seasons, 1896–1898.[9] Sam Boyle coached for only one year in 1899 and compiled a 4–6–1 record (.409).[10] Pop Golden coached the Nittany Lions for three seasons from 1900 to 1902, tallying a record of 16–12–1 (.569).[11] Daniel A. Reed took over for the 1903 season and went 5–3 (.625).[12] Tom Fennell coached the Nittany Lions for five seasons from 1904 to 1908, posting a 33–17–1 (.657) record.[13] In 1907 the school adopted the Nittany Lion mascot, a mountain lion named after nearby Mount Nittany.[14][page needed] An early mascot was \"Old Coaly\", a mule that hauled stone for the original Old Main (completed in 1863 and demolished in 1929). Bill Hollenback took over the Nittany Lions as head coach for the 1909 season and went undefeated at 5–0–2,[15] but left for Missouri for 1910.[16] Bill's older brother Jack Hollenback took over for the 1910 season and went 5–2–1 (.688),[17] but Bill returned to Penn State from 1911 to 1914.[citation needed] Bill went 23–9–2 in his second tenure for a combined record of 28–9–4 (.732).[15] In 1911 and 1912, his teams went 8–0–1 and 8–0 and were awarded retroactive national championships by the National Championship Foundation which are recognized by the NCAA.[15] Head coach Dick Harlow brought a new form of defense, trying to go in-between or around offensive blockers rather than try to overpower them.[18][non-primary source needed] Harlow's Nittany Lions compiled a 20–8 (.714) record in his three seasons (1915–1917)[19] and was later inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach for his accomplishments.[18] Hugo Bezdek was Penn State's head football coach for 12 seasons[20] and was the Nittany Lions' first athletics director.[21] Bezdek posted a 65–30–11 record,[20] which included two undefeated seasons and a berth in the 1922 Rose Bowl, a game they lost.[20] Bezdek's Nittany Lions posted a losing record in only two of Bezdek's seasons, going 1–2–1 in 1918 and 3–5–1 in 1928.[20] Bezdek retired after the 1929 season and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1954.[21] Bob Higgins returned to his alma mater and served as Penn State's head football coach for 19 seasons.[22] He compiled a 91–57–11 overall record, which included 11 winning seasons and only five losing seasons.[22] Higgins' 1947 team tied SMU in the Cotton Bowl.[23] Higgins was forced to retire due to poor health following the 1948 season.[23] He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1954.[23] For one season, Joe Bedenk, also a Penn State alum, served as the Nittany Lions' head football coach.[24] He was promoted from offensive line coach after the retirement of his predecessor.[25] Bedenk posted a 5–4 record in his 1949,[24] his lone season as head coach, before requesting to return to his previous post as offensive line coach.[25] Rip Engle came to Penn State from Brown.[26][27] Engle posted a 104–48–4 record during his 16-season tenure as head coach and developed a game known as Angleball as a way for his players to maintain fitness in the off-season.[26][27] Engle never had a losing season at Penn State, and his 5–5 final season was his only non-winning season.[28] His 1959 and 1960 Nittany Lions teams won the Liberty Bowl, while his 1961 and 1962 teams reached the Gator Bowl, winning the first and losing the second.[28] Engle retired following the 1965 season and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1973.[26] Penn State assistant Joe Paterno was promoted to head coach following the retirement of Engle.[25] Paterno spent 46 seasons as the head football coach, the longest tenure of any head coach in the FBS, and 16 more seasons as an assistant, making his 62 total years coaching at Penn State the most of any coach at any school.[25] Under Paterno, Penn State played as an Independent from 1966 to 1992,[25] and he continued to coach them when they joined the Big Ten Conference in 1993–2011.[25] He also served as Penn State's athletic director from 1980 to 1982. His final record is 409–136–3.[29] His teams won national championships in 1982 and 1986,[29] posted non-losing records in all seasons but five,[29] and appeared in 37 bowl games with 24 wins.[29] His teams also won the Orange Bowl in 1968, 1969, 1973 and 2005;[29] the Fiesta Bowl in 1977, 1980, 1981, 1986, 1991 and 1996;[29] the Sugar Bowl in 1982; and the Rose Bowl in 1994.[29] In June 1990,[30] Penn State's athletics program, after a century as a Division I-A independent, joined the Big Ten Conference. Beaver Stadium was expanded six times during Paterno's tenure. He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2006 and was a major reason why the longtime rule of waiting until retirement to be inducted into the Hall of Fame was changed to any coach over 75 years of age.[25] Players including Kerry Collins, Charlie Zapiec, Matt Millen, Shane Conlan, Jack Ham, Dennis Onkotz, Franco Harris, Greg Buttle, Keith Dorney, John Cappelletti, Curt Warner, Larry Johnson, LaVar Arrington and Ted Kwalick played collegiately for him.[31] He won numerous coaching and sportsman honors during his long run at Penn State.[29] Paterno has the most wins in FBS football (409). Following the Pennsylvania Attorney General's release of a grand jury summary of child sexual abuse charges involving former assistant Jerry Sandusky,[32] the Penn State board of trustees fired Paterno in November 2011.[32][33] Defensive coordinator Tom Bradley finished out the 2011 season as interim head coach after Paterno's ouster.[34] In July 2012, the NCAA decided to vacate all of the team's wins from 1998 to 2011. Paterno's statue outside Beaver Stadium was also taken down.[35] The revised record dropped Paterno from first to twelfth on the all-time wins list,[36] but on January 16, 2015, the NCAA restored Paterno's vacated wins, and thus his record as the winningest FBS football coach.[37] To many he is \"The best Penn State head coach ever.\"[38] New England Patriots offensive coordinator Bill O'Brien was hired as the 15th head football coach at Penn State, taking over the Nittany Lions football program in January 2012.[39] Early in O'Brien's tenure, the NCAA sanctioned Penn State with a four-season postseason ban and a loss of 40 scholarships due to the child sex abuse scandal.[40] O'Brien posted an 8–4 record in his first season as head coach of the Nittany Lions.[41] O'Brien's 2013 Nittany Lions team posted a 7–5 record in the second of four years they were ineligible for the postseason.[42] In January 2014, Bill O'Brien left Penn State to accept the head coaching position with the NFL's Houston Texans.[43] On January 11, 2014, Vanderbilt head coach James Franklin was hired as the 16th Penn State head football coach.[44] He is the first African American head football coach at Penn State.[45] In Franklin's first year, the NCAA lifted Penn State's postseason ban and the Nittany Lions were bowl eligible. The Nittany Lions were named to the Pinstripe Bowl where they won against Boston College on December 27, 2014, at Yankee Stadium.[46] To start off the 2015 season, Penn State lost to Temple 27–10, its first loss to the Owls since 1941. The loss was followed by victories against Buffalo, Rutgers, San Diego State, Army and Indiana. The Nittany Lions then lost to Ohio State 38–10 in Columbus before winning, 31–30, at Maryland. The victory against Maryland brought the Nittany Lions to six wins, making them bowl eligible for the second year since the postseason ban was lifted. Penn State then shut out the Illinois 39–0 in the second to last home game of the 2015 season. They then lost to Michigan in Happy Valley 28–16 and to Michigan State 55–16 at MSU. The win–loss record for Penn State in the 2015 regular season was 7–5, and 7–6 after a loss to Georgia in the Taxslayer Bowl in Jacksonville. The 2016 season featured an upset over No. 2 Ohio State during a \"White-Out\" in State College. Following the win, Penn State was ranked 24th in the AP Poll, its first ranking since 2011.[47] Penn State finished the regular season 10–2, 8–1 in Big Ten play. After winning a tiebreaker against rivals Ohio State, Penn State went on to claim the Big Ten East title and a spot in the Big Ten Championship game in Indianapolis against Big Ten West champion Wisconsin, which they won after trailing 28–14 in the first half. They outscored the Badgers 24–3 in the second half to take home the Nittany Lions' fourth Big Ten Title.[48] On August 18, 2017, Penn State announced that Franklin signed a six-year contract extension worth $5.738 million a year.[49] That deal includes retention bonuses paid at the end of each year of the contract. \"My family and I are very thankful to be a part of the Penn State community,\" Franklin said in a statement. \"I am pleased with the progress our program has made in the community, in the classroom and on the field. I look forward to diligently working with President Barron and Director of Athletics Sandy Barbour on implementing a plan that puts our University and our student-athletes in the best position to compete on the field and in life.\"[50] In addition to the guaranteed money, Franklin's contract extension has incentives including $800,000 for a national title, $400,000 for a College Football Playoff appearance and $350,000 for winning the Big Ten Championship Game. His incentives are capped at $1 million per year.[51] Penn State went to 7–0 to begin the 2017 season, before losing on consecutive weekends to Ohio State and Michigan State. Penn State finished the regular season with wins over Rutgers Nebraska and Maryland. Penn State capped the 2017 season at the Fiesta Bowl, beating Washington, 35–28.[52] In 2018 the Lions went 9–4 with a loss to Kentucky in the Citrus Bowl. The 2019 season was spectacular for Penn State going 11–2 with the losses only to Minnesota by 26–31 and to Ohio State and beat American Athletic Conference Champion Memphis who at that time was 12–1. Penn State beat Memphis 53–39 in the Cotton Bowl. The 2020 season was James Franklin's first losing season with the Nittany Lions. They started off the season with COVID-19 pandemic spring cancelations. Penn State traveled to Bloomington to take on Indiana where they lost in overtime 35–36 with Michael Penix Jr.'s pendulum touch two-point conversion winning the Game for Indiana. The Nittany Lions took on Ohio State at home with no whiteout due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Penn State lost 25–38. The Nittany Lions took on Maryland who they had not lost to since 2014. The Terrapins beat Penn State 19–35 in Beaver Stadium. The Nittany Lions traveled to Nebraska to take on the Nebraska Cornhuskers where the Nittany Lions comeback fell short and lost 23–30. The Nittany Lions fought the Iowa Hawkeyes but lost 21–41 giving Penn State its first ever 0–5 start in its history. The Nittany Lions, determined to win, traveled to Ann Arbor to defeat the Michigan Wolverines. Penn State got its first victory of the season 27–17 going 1–5. Penn State took on the Rutgers Scarlet Knights in Piscataway where they won again 23–7 thus giving them a 2–5 record. Penn State went home to take on the Michigan State. They trailed 10–21 at halftime but rallied back to win 39–24 getting a 3–5 record. For the Big Ten Championship week Penn State hosted the Fighting Illini at home. Penn State won in rout 56–21 going to a 4–5 record. Penn State players voted to not accept a bowl invitation so their final record was 4–5. A major offseason change was replacing first-year offensive coordinator Kirk Ciarrocca with Texas offensive coordinator Mike Yurcich. James Franklin is currently under a ten-year $75,000,000 contract (as of 2021). In 2021, Penn State improved upon its lackluster 2020 season going 7–6. The Nittany Lions finished the season unranked and with a 4–5 Big Ten Conference record. They went 2–3 on the road while maintaining a winning 5–2 record at Beaver Stadium. The season started strong on September 4, 2021, when Penn State defeated the #12 ranked Wisconsin Badgers football team. They won their next 4 games including a 28–20 win over the #22 Auburn Tigers football team. Then they began to struggle after a close 23–20 loss to the #3 Iowa Hawkeyes on the road October 9, 2021. On October 23, 2021, Penn State battled the Illinois Fighting Illini through an NCAA record 9 overtimes, eventually losing 20–18. The teams both scored fieldgoals in the first 2 overtimes, tying the score 16–16. Neither team scored until the 8th overtime when Illinois finally broke the stalemate, quickly followed by a run from Penn State's Noah Cain. Penn State did not score during its first conversion attempt in overtime 9, leaving the door open for Illinois to eventually score and win the game.[53] The Nittany Lions' only subsequent wins came against Maryland (31–14) and Rutgers (28–0). They closed out the 2021 season playing Arkansas at the Outback Bowl, losing the game 24–10.[54] Penn State has a strong 2022 campaign losing to only Michigan and Ohio State and defeating Pac 12 champion Utah in the 2023 Rose Bowl. Penn State has also been named national champions on seven occasions by NCAA-designated major selectors.[55][56]: 111–115 Penn State claims the 1982 and 1986 championships under Joe Paterno's tenure,[57] both of which are consensus national championships.[56]: 120 Historically, Penn State played as an independent from 1887 through 1890, then in 1891 as a member of the Pennsylvania Intercollegiate Football Association Penn State won the PIFA championship with a 4–1–0 PIFA record, losing only to Bucknell (Bucknell's record was 3–1–1). The PIFA dissolved prior to the 1892 season. Penn State then played as an independent again until joining the Big Ten Conference in 1990 and beginning play in 1993. Penn State then won its first Big Ten championship in 1994, they won two more in 2005 and 2008, and they won a fourth under James Franklin in 2016. † Co-champions † Co-champions Before the 2006 season, Beaver Stadium was updated and seasons of note were honored by being listed in front of the suite façade.[58] The following seasons are highlighted; Penn State has earned invitations to 53 bowl games. The Nittany Lions have compiled a bowl record of 31–20–2 (.604), including a 17–7–1 (.700) record in the major bowls (Rose, Orange, Sugar, Fiesta, and Cotton).[59] Coach Joe Paterno was responsible for most of these bids and victories, compiling more appearances (37) than any other coach in college football en route to his bowl record of 24–12–1 (.662). Paterno also has a record of 14–5 (.737) in \"major\" bowls and is the only coach to have won all five major college bowls during his career. James Franklin is the head coach of Penn State since the 2014 season.[60] Penn State and Maryland met in briefly interrupted stretches between 1917 and 1993, with a near-consecutive run played all but three years (1976, 1981, and 1983) between 1960 and 1993. However, the one-sided record belies what was often a competitive matchup until its final years. While Maryland only compiled one win and one tie, numerous games were narrowly lost by missed field goals and turnovers. In 1975, a field goal attempt by kicker Mike Sochko hit the upright with under a minute left, and Maryland lost 15–13. Ten years later, the Terps missed three field goals to eventually lose 20–18. After the Nittany Lions' move to the Big Ten Conference in 1993, the series was canceled. However, Maryland ended up joining the Big Ten as well, in 2014, reinstating the rivalry after more than 2 decades of being dormant. Maryland would win the first matchup by a point (20–19) after infamously declining to shake hands with Penn State captains at midfield during the coin toss at Beaver Stadium. The second meeting as conference foes would be played in Baltimore at M&T Bank Stadium and would again be decided by a point, this time a Penn State win 31–30. The last four matchups (2016–2019), all victories for Penn State have seen the Nittany Lions outscore the Terrapins by a combined score of 201–20 (38–14, 66–3, 38–3, 59–0). The latest match up was played on November 30, 2024, at Beaver Stadium, with Penn State winning 44–7. Penn State leads the series 44–3–1 through the 2024 season.[61] Prior to 1993, Penn State had never played against Michigan, but since then many of the games have been competitive duals with shots at a Big Ten title at stake, and subsequently a national championship. Michigan leads the series, 17–10.[62] Since 1993, Penn State has played Michigan State for the Land Grant Trophy. Penn State holds possession of the trophy after winning the 2023 contest. Penn State leads the series, 19–18–1 as of 2024.[63] When Penn State joined the Big Ten in 1993, Minnesota was the first conference opponent they played. To commerate this, the governors of both states commissioned a trophy called the Governor's Victory Bell to landmark this event. Since then, the trophy has traveled hands between the winners of each contest. Penn State leads the series, 11–6.[64] The rivalry began before Penn State was a member of the Big Ten. Penn State won the first four meetings of the series, which were held between 1912 and 1964. Then Ohio State won in 1975 in a game held in Columbus, Ohio and again in 1976 during the first ever matchup between the two teams in State College, Pennsylvania. Penn State and Ohio State would meet again in 1980 in their first and only postseason bowl, the 1980 Fiesta Bowl, which Penn State won. After the Fiesta Bowl, the two teams would not meet again until Penn State joined the Big Ten in 1993. Since then, the Nittany Lions and Buckeyes have played each other annually. Ohio State leads the series 25–14 through the 2024 season.[65] This is a long-standing series between in-state rivals Penn State and Pittsburgh. The rivalry, once one of the fiercest and most important in college football north of the Mason–Dixon line, began on November 6, 1893, at the inaugural game of Beaver Field in State College, and Penn State won the contest 32–0.[66] The first two decades of the series was dominated by Penn State taking 12 of 15 matchups between 1893 and 1912. From 1913 to 1949 Pitt would hold a 26–6–2 advantage, before Rip Engle took over as head coach for Penn State in 1950. With Joe Paterno as an assistant coach, Engle led Penn State to a 9–6–1 record against the Panthers from 1950 to 1965. When Paterno was named head coach in 1965, the next 31 games would swing heavily in the Nittany Lion's favor, holding a 23–7–1 advantage from 1966 to 2000.[67] The rivalry went on a 15-year hiatus prior to the scheduling of a 4-game series in 2011[68] that would see Penn State travel to Pittsburgh in 2016 & 2018 with Pitt returning to Happy Valley in 2017 & 2019. The series was branded the Keystone Classic in 2016,[69] which saw Pitt hold on for a thrilling 42–39[70] victory fending off a fierce fourth quarter comeback that fell short on an interception late in the 4th quarter.[71] The Nittany Lions would take the final three games, winning 33–13 in 2017, 51–6 in 2018, and most recently 17–10[72] in Beaver Stadium in 2019.[73] There are no future games scheduled between the two schools, although there is talk of a potential neutral site matchup sometime in the future.[74] The Nittany Lions and Panthers have met on the football field 100 times. Penn State holds a 10-win advantage in the series, 53–43–4, through the 2024 season.[75] The rivalry started in 1922, when Syracuse fought Penn State to a scoreless tie. But it was during the 1950s and 1960s that the rivalry intensified, as it enjoyed a competitive and often controversial string of contests. Syracuse football was led by Ben Schwartzwalder, and Penn State by Rip Engle, then Joe Paterno. From 1950 to 1970, Syracuse won 11 games to Penn State's 10. After Schwartzwalder retired in 1973, Syracuse floundered. Penn State won 16 straight from 1971 to 1986. Conference realignment and scheduling disagreements also dampened the intensity of the rivalry. Penn State fans and players increasingly turned their attention to the rivalry with Pittsburgh. In 1987, Coach Dick MacPherson finally led Syracuse to a resounding 48–21 victory over the Nittany Lions in the Carrier Dome. Syracuse won again the following year in Happy Valley but lost the last two games before the series was suspended in 1991. The rivalry has since been renewed three times since the series suspension — in 2008, 2009, and 2013. The Nittany Lions won all three of these contests. Penn State leads the series 43–23–5 with the most recent game played in 2013. Next meeting between the two teams is scheduled for September 4, 2027.[76] Penn State and West Virginia have played each other 59 times. The first game was in 1904 when Penn State won that game 34–0. In their most recent encounter on August 31, 2024, Penn State won 34–12 in Morgantown. This series has been dominated by the Nittany Lions who lead the series 50–9–2.[77] Though the Crimson Tide are not as much of a traditional opponent for the Nittany Lions, the two teams are still often considered among the best in the country, claim a combined 20 national titles, and have met in a bowl game three times. The series began on December 19, 1959, in that year's edition of the Liberty Bowl, a 7–0 win for No. 12 Penn State. Sixteen years later, the Nittany Lions and Crimson Tide met in the 1975 Sugar Bowl, resulting in a 13–6 Tide victory in New Orleans. Perhaps the most notable game between these two teams came four years later, in a 1979 Sugar Bowl rematch, resulting in another Alabama victory. The rivalry was intensified during the 1980s, when the Lions and Tide met in 10 consecutive seasons, all during regular season play. After this time, the rivalry went dormant for two decades before being renewed for a 2-game home-and-home series in 2010 and 2011. Alabama leads the series 10–5 with the last game played in 2011.[78] This White Out tradition dates back to a student section white out in 2004 (against Purdue) and has become one of the most eagerly anticipated games during the football season. In recent years, Penn State students have donned white clothes, paint - anything white - to show their solidarity and support for the Nittany Lions. Forming a mass of bouncing and infectious enthusiasm, the students have \"Whited Out\" Beaver Stadium, the Bryce Jordan Center and other sports venues, making them some of the noisiest and most intimidating stadiums in America.[79] Beano Cook of ESPN says, \"If you aren't impressed with the White Out, you're probably one of those people who think the moon landing was faked.\"[80] Originally named \"Paternoville\", Nittanyville is a student camp out that occurs every week of a Penn State home football game. The students camp out to support the team and to acquire the best possible seats for the weekend's upcoming game, since seating is first-come, first serve for students. While the name \"Paternoville\" came about during Penn State's 2005 football season, students have long camped out for first row seats. Prior to 1993, the university distributed non-seat-specific tickets. Starting the same year Penn State football began competition in the Big Ten Conference, students were assigned seats on a first-come-first-serve basis, so that the first students to pass through \"Gate A\" at the south-east corner of the stadium would be assigned first row seats, and so on down the line.[81] Since then, students have camped out in small to massive numbers in order to guarantee themselves a front row seat to a Penn State home football game. The 2005 season saw the naming of the tent-city. In anticipation of the 2005 contest between No. 16 Penn State and No. 6 Ohio State, students began camping six days in advance of the game outside the gate so that they would get a first row seat for, arguably, the biggest game of the 2005 season for Penn State. On Tuesday of the week preceding the game, \"Paternoville\" first appeared. Credited with the naming, freshman Dan Clark and the other students camping with him created a banner reading \"Paternoville\".[82] The name stuck, and on Wednesday morning, October 5, 2005, newspapers were already referring to the campsite as \"Paternoville\". State-wide, regional, and even national media outlets began paying attention to the show in front of Gate A. Local businesses printed t-shirts up for the students, brought truckloads of food, and distributed various things like magazines and small footballs to keep the students occupied. Throughout the week, players, coaches, and many alumni and media personalities paid visits to Paternoville.[83] On Friday, ESPN's \"Cold Pizza\" morning show was broadcast from in front of the Bryce Jordan Center, across from the stadium, with some of the cast walking through Paternoville interviewing students and taping their activities, despite the constant drizzle. The next day, ESPN's College Gameday also was broadcast in front of the Bryce Jordan Center, hours before the showdown between the cross-border rivals.[84] Before noon, the tents were packed away and hundreds of students began to line up for entry into the stadium. That night, in a historic game, the Nittany Lions upset the No. 6 ranked Buckeyes 17–10 in front of a crowd of almost 110,000. The game being decided on a fumble by Ohio State quarterback and future Heisman Trophy winner Troy Smith, caused by Penn State defensive end Tamba Hali and recovered by defensive tackle Scott Paxson. After the final whistle, the students rushed the field.[85] The Paternoville name continued after the game. Since the original \"Paternoville\", two other games have garnered comparable camp-outs. They were the 2005 game against the University of Wisconsin Badgers, which was Senior Day for the 2005 season,[86] and the 2006 contest against University of Michigan Wolverines. However, students camp out for every game, not solely the \"big\" games. On average, about 10–15 tents appear for every game, while the number of tents for the 2005 Ohio State and Wisconsin games and the 2006 Michigan game exceeded 100.[87] Prior to the 2006 season, the university placed several markers around Beaver Stadium commemorating various traditions related to Penn State football. To the left of Gate A there is a marker for the Penn State \"student section\" and to the right of the gate there is a marker for \"Paternoville\".[88] Since 2006, the practice of camping out has grown every year until 2009, when over 2,000 different students camped out for one or multiple games throughout the season. In 2011, the record was broken because of Penn State's high-powered home schedule, which included SEC powerhouse Alabama and new in-conference foe Nebraska, amongst other teams.[89] In the summer of 2012, \"Paternoville\" officially became \"Nittanyville\". As Coach Paterno was no longer the coach of Penn State's football team, the organization decided that since it was unlikely another coach would stay as long as Coach Paterno had, changing the name for each new coach would be impractical. However, aside from the name, nothing was changed and students continued to support the team and camp out for the primary seats.[90] Joe Paterno was widely known for his \"grand experiment\" in which he challenged his players to be successful both on the field and in the classroom.[91] In 2011, the Nittany Lion football team posted an 87% graduation rate, tied with Stanford for No. 10 overall among the nation's 120 Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) institutions, above the national average of 67%.[92] The June 2012 conviction of former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky on multiple counts of child sexual abuse marred the \"Success with Honor\" image.[93] President Rodney Erickson, athletics director Dave Joyner, and head football coach Bill O'Brien, all of whom accepted their jobs in the wake of the scandal, have made statements in which they express commitment to maintaining integrity at the university and within the athletics programs.[94] In 2012, a group of alumni and supporters established a non-profit organization [501(c)(3) and registered trademark] that will build upon the \"Success with Honor\" motto. Their mission is to promote and support charitable endeavors as well as to inspire others to \"Get in the Game.\" Success with Honor is a Social Network Community that has identified more than 60+ charities. Success with Honor helps individuals to identify and connect with causes they would like to volunteer their skills, time, and/or money to. Similarly, SWH assists charities in finding individuals to meet their current needs.[95] The team is widely noted for their simple game uniforms. They only wear white pants, and the jerseys are simple blue for home games, and white for away games.[96] The team is only allowed to wear simple black Nike shoes with white calf socks for game days, though blue tights are permitted underneath the white socks for cold weather games. The helmet is white with a blue stripe down the center, and a blue on white \"Penn State\" sticker covers up the forehead helmet logo. No team logos, conference logos, numbers, or other stickers are permitted on the helmet, though two Nike logos are on facemask visors that some players choose to wear. Penn State has started to wear bowl decals only starting with 1997 Fiesta Bowl. Before that, Penn State always declined the decals so they can play out of their simple game uniforms. The blue and white uniforms replaced the school's original colors, pink and black, in 1890 after a student referendum. A common legend of the color change is that the original colors faded in the sun. Black became a hue of navy blue and the pink became such a light hue that it appeared white. The historicity of this, however, is very questionable, as evidence of it being the root cause is scarce.[97] The uniforms became even simpler for the 2011 season, as the white cuffs and collars on the home jerseys and the corresponding blue cuffs and collars on the road jerseys were eliminated, leaving the jerseys solid blue and white, respectively. In 2012 Penn State started wearing names on their uniforms for the first time as a way to note the players who stuck with the school through the scandal and a blue ribbon in support the victims of child abuse.[98] In 2013, the Nittany Lion logo was added to the base of the jersey collar along with the Big Ten logo on the right side of the jersey. Starting in 2015, the names that were added throughout the 2012–14 seasons to honor those who stayed with the program were removed and the team reverted to the traditional nameless jerseys while still retaining the Nittany Lion logo at the base of the jersey collar. The team also began sporting new Nike Elite 51 jerseys which feature a new design on the collars.[99] In addition, the team added the words \"Nittany Lions\" onto the back of the football helmets. For the 2017 homecoming game against the Indiana Hoosiers, Penn State broke tradition by donning throwback jerseys in what was dubbed the \"Generations of Greatness\" game. These uniforms integrated elements from past uniforms, including: numbers on helmets' sides, block uniform numbers, white stripes on sleeves, blue stripes on pants, striped socks, gray facemasks, white cleats, and a few other subtle changes.[100] Captains are chosen by the team, with the head coach's approval. Being named a captain is an honor almost always given to a senior, but there are some notable exceptions: Linebacker Sean Lee was named a captain in the beginning of Spring practice in 2008, the beginning of his 4th year with the team. However, he suffered a torn ACL during spring practice, redshirted in 2008, and returned as a captain again in 2009. The most recent example of a \"true\" junior being named was Paul Posluszny, who was named a captain in both 2005 and 2006, his junior and senior years, respectively. The last time a junior was named captain before Posluszny was in 1968, when Steve Smear and Mike Reid were named captains during their junior years.[101] In 2014, Christian Hackenberg became the first true sophomore to be named team captain.[102] Penn State is referred to as Linebacker U for its reputation of producing outstanding linebackers.[103][better source needed] The scandal centered on then retired Penn State football assistant coach Jerry Sandusky's sexual assault of two underage boys on or near university property. After a grand jury investigation, Sandusky was indicted on 52 counts of child molestation dating from 1994.[110] The trial started on June 11, 2012, at the Centre County Courthouse in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania,[111][112] and ended on June 22, when the jury found Sandusky guilty on 45 counts.[113][114] On October 9, 2012, Sandusky was sentenced to 30–60 years in prison.[115] Several high-level school officials were charged with perjury,[116] suspended, or dismissed for allegedly covering up the incidents or failing to notify authorities. School president Graham Spanier was forced to resign, and head football coach Joe Paterno was fired without cause late in the season, while Sandusky maintained his innocence.[117] Former FBI director Louis Freeh, whose firm was hired by the Penn State Board of Trustees to conduct an investigation, concluded, after ostensibly conducting 400 interviews and reviewing 3.5 million documents, that Paterno, Spanier, Curley and Schultz had \"repeatedly concealed critical facts relating to Sandusky's abuse from the authorities, the Board of Trustees, Penn State community, and the public at large.\"[118][119][120] In an interview on 60 Minutes Sports, the former Chief Deputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania, Frank Fina, who investigated and prosecuted Sandusky, stated he found no evidence that Paterno participated in a cover-up.[121] In July 2012, NCAA announced it had fined the Penn State football program $60 million, levied a 4-year ban from bowl games and vacated all the program's 112 wins from 1998 to 2011. The program was originally scheduled to lose 10 scholarships from incoming classes in 2013–16, which would have been a loss of 40 scholarships.[122] In September 2013, the NCAA announced they were restoring 25 of the 40 scholarships to Penn State \"[d]ue to Penn State University's continued progress toward ensuring athletics integrity\". After losing 10 scholarships from the 2013–2014 incoming class and only having 75 total players on scholarship, Penn State gained five scholarships back for 2014–15, bringing in 20 new players with 80 total on scholarship. Full scholarships were regained for 2016–17. In total they lost only 15 scholarships.[123] The decision to return the scholarships was by the executive committee of the NCAA following a recommendation from former US Sen. George Mitchell. The NCAA had appointed Mitchell to monitor progress of Penn State's reforms to enhance their \"security, ethics, governance and compliance structure\". The decision was based upon the belief the restored scholarships would provide benefits to student-athletes.[124] Lawsuits were filed against NCAA related to the levy of penalties. In 2014 the NCAA, under the auspices of favorable reports from Mitchell, announced that Penn State would be eligible for the 2014 postseason and all scholarships restored in 2015.[125] The team's wins and records that had been vacated were restored, pending full approval, as part of a legal settlement in 2015.[126][127] Penn State is one of 11 schools with five or more inductees in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[143] Including former head coach Joe Paterno, 25 Nittany Lion players and coaches have been selected for the College Football Hall of Fame.[144] [145][146]",

The Tigers compete in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). In recent years, the Tigers have been ranked among the most elite college football programs in the United States.[2][3][4] Formed in 1896, the program has an all-time record of 804–473–44,[5] with a bowl record of 27-23. Clemson was a College Football Playoff finalist in 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2019, defeating Alabama in both 2016 and 2018 to secure the national title. Clemson has had six undefeated seasons (including the first-ever 15–0 team), boasted six consecutive playoff appearances from 2015 to 2021, and retains 27 conference championships, including 8 since 2011. Its alumni include over 100 All-Americans, 17 Academic All-Americans and over 250 players in the National Football League.[6][7] Clemson has had eight members inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame: players Banks McFadden, Terry Kinard, Jeff Davis, and C. J. Spiller along with coaches John Heisman, Jess Neely, Frank Howard, and Danny Ford. Clemson is one of the founding members of the ACC and holds 22 ACC titles, the most of any member. Its 28 total conference titles, including six consecutive ACC titles from 2015 to 2020, are the most of any ACC school. Clemson's most recent ACC title came in 2024, against SMU. Clemson's streak of eleven consecutive 10-win seasons from 2011-2022 ranked second in active streaks behind the Alabama Crimson Tide, coming to an end after Clemson's 2023 season where they finished with a 9-4 record.[8][9] Among its eight undefeated regular seasons, Clemson has been crowned national champion 3 times. Clemson was named poll-era national champion and finished with its third perfect season with a win over Nebraska in the 1982 Orange Bowl. Clemson was the National Championship Finalist Runner-up with a 14–1 record in 2015 before winning the National Title over No. 1 Alabama in college football's first National Championship rematch in 2016, and again in 2018. The Tigers have 46 bowl appearances, 20 of which are among the New Year's Six Bowls, including nine during the \"Big Four\" era. Clemson has 34 finishes in the final top 25 in the modern era and it finished in either the Associated Press final poll or the coaches' final poll a combined 59 times since 1939. The Tigers play their home games in Memorial Stadium on the university's Clemson, South Carolina campus. The stadium's nickname, \"Death Valley\" was coined in 1948 by Presbyterian College head coach Lonnie McMillan after his teams were routinely defeated there. Memorial Stadium is among the largest stadiums in college football. Walter Riggs, often regarded as the \"father of Clemson football,\" brought the sport to Clemson from the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama (now Auburn University). The team's first game, played on Halloween 1896, resulted in a 2–1 record for the inaugural season. Riggs influenced the choice of the team mascot and colors. The Tigers’ early success included their first undefeated season in 1900 under coach John W. Heisman, who led the team to a 19–3–2 record. Heisman’s coaching set a precedent for excellence and innovation. During the mid-20th century, the program experienced substantial growth under Frank Howard, who coached from 1940 to 1969. Howard's tenure saw Clemson win two Southern Conference championships and six ACC championships. Known for his colorful personality and imaginative storytelling, Howard integrated various offensive formations. His legacy includes the tradition of rubbing \"Howard's Rock\" before home games and the naming of the playing field at Memorial Stadium as \"Frank Howard Field\" in 1974. The late 20th century and early 21st century saw the football program navigate through challenges and successes under multiple head coaches. Danny Ford led the Tigers to their first national championship in 1981, achieving an undefeated season. Ford's era was marked by NCAA sanctions due to recruiting violations, which impacted the program's reputation and success. Ken Hatfield, Ford’s successor, focused on cleaning up the program's image but faced criticism from fans, leading to his resignation. Subsequent coaches, including Tommy West, struggled to achieve consistent success until the hiring of Tommy Bowden in 1999, who maintained bowl eligibility every season, but failed to secure an ACC championship. The modern era is defined by the leadership of Dabo Swinney, who became head coach in 2008. Swinney revitalized the program, leading the Tigers to multiple ACC championships and two national titles in 2016 and 2018. His tenure has been characterized by significant achievements, including the establishment of Clemson as a perennial contender in the College Football Playoff. Swinney’s ability to recruit and develop talent, combined with strategic hires like offensive coordinator Chad Morris and defensive coordinator Brent Venables, has sustained Clemson’s success. Notably, under Swinney, Clemson became the first team since 1897 to finish a season 15–0. In 2022, Clemson defeated Syracuse 27–21, extending the Tigers' home winning streak to 38, a new ACC record. Clemson claims three national championships. In 1981 they finished as the only undefeated team with a 22–15 victory over the No. 4 Nebraska Cornhuskers in the 1982 Orange Bowl, and were named the national champions[10] by all major four consensus selectors [11] (AP, Coaches, FWAA, and NFF). In 2016 and 2018 they won the College Football Playoff, defeating Alabama in the CFP National Championship Game both times. † Other selectors for 1981 included Berryman, Billingsley, DeVold, FACT, FB News, Football Research, Helms, Litkenhous, Matthews, National Championship Foundation, New York Times, Poling, Sagarin, and Sporting News[12]†† Other selectors for 2016 include A&H, BR, CCR, CFRA, DuS, MCFR, SR, W††† Other selectors for 2018 include A&H, BR, CCR, CFRA, CM, DuS, MCFR, SR, W Clemson won the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association in 1900 and 1902 (tied 1903 and 1906) along with the Southern Conference title in 1940 and 1948.[13] Their 22 ACC titles (20 outright, 2 tied) are the most ACC football championships.[citation needed][when?] In 1965, South Carolina violated participation rules relating to two ineligible players and was required to forfeit wins against North Carolina State and Clemson.[14] North Carolina State and Clemson were then declared co-champions.[15] † Co-champions In 2005, the Atlantic Coast Conference divided into two divisions of six teams each and began holding an ACC Championship Game at the conclusion of the regular football season to determine the conference champion. Clemson won its first outright ACC Atlantic Division championship in 2009. In 2012 and 2016, Clemson was co-champion of the Atlantic Division. On August 18, 2011, Georgia Tech vacated their 2009 ACC Championship Game victory over Clemson due to NCAA violations. The game is considered by the NCAA and ACC to have no winner.[16] Clemson was selected as the one seed in the second College Football Playoff and defeated the fourth seed Oklahoma on December 31, 2015, in the 2015 Orange Bowl. They lost to the Alabama Crimson Tide in the championship game on January 11, 2016. Clemson was selected to the third College Football Playoff as the second seed and defeated the third seed Ohio State on December 31, 2016, in the 2016 PlayStation Fiesta Bowl. The Tigers defeated the Alabama Crimson Tide in the national championship games in both 2017 and 2019. Clemson has a 6–4 record in playoff games through the 2019 season. Clemson has ended their football season ranked 38 times in either the AP or Coaches Poll.[17] Clemson had 12 consecutive 10-win seasons from 2011 to 2022. Before the streak came to an end in 2023, it was the 2nd longest active streak behind Alabama with 16.[17] † AP Poll began selecting the nation's Top 20 teams in 1936. Only the Top 10 teams were recognized from 1962 to 1967. The AP Poll expanded back to the Top 20 teams in 1968. In 1989, it began recognizing the Top 25 teams. ‡ UPI/Coaches Poll began selecting its Top 20 teams on a weekly basis in 1950 before expanding to the nation's Top 25 teams in 1990. Clemson holds a 27–23 record in bowl games through the 2022 season.[18] This is a list of Clemson's 16 most recent bowl games. The two southern schools have long, decorated histories in the sport of college football.[33] They first met on the football field on November 29, 1900.[34] Clemson won the inaugural matchup by a score of 35–0.[35] The Crimson Tide and Tigers met again in 1904 and 1905, with Clemson winning both games.[36] Beginning with the next meeting between the two squads in 1909, Alabama won the next thirteen matchups against Clemson.[36] The Tide posted the biggest margin of victory in the rivalry in 1931, beating the Tigers by a margin of 74–7.[37][38] In the first seven games of Alabama's 13-game streak, Clemson only score seven total points and was shut out in six of the seven games.[36] After a 56–0 shutout Alabama victory in 1975, the squads didn't meet again until 2008, when they squared off on opening weekend in Atlanta, Georgia.[39] The Tide emerged victorious with a 34–10 victory.[40] The last four matchups between the squads have had national championship implications and have greatly re-intensified the rivalry. The teams squared off in the 2016 College Football Playoff National Championship in Glendale, Arizona, resulting in Alabama emerging with a thrilling 45–40 victory.[41] The next year, the teams again found themselves doing battle in the 2017 College Football Playoff National Championship in Tampa, Florida, with Clemson emerging with a last-second 35–31 victory and their first win over the Crimson Tide since 1905.[42] Once again the teams met in the 2018 Sugar Bowl semifinal in New Orleans, Louisiana with a trip to the 2018 College Football Playoff National Championship game on the line.[43] Alabama won by a score of 24–6 following two costly Clemson interceptions in the second half.[44] Their most recent meeting was in the 2019 College Football Playoff National Championship. This time, Clemson dismantled the No. 1-ranked Crimson Tide in a 44–16 rout to win its third national title. Alabama leads the series 14–5 through the 2023 season.[45] These old rivals (which are often called sister schools) first played in 1899, but until 2010, had not faced each other in the regular season since 1971. Along with snapping a 14-game losing streak to the Tigers of the Plains, Clemson also snapped Auburn's 17-game winning streak coming off of the 2009–2011 seasons after a home-and-home series in the 2010–11 seasons. The Georgia Dome then hosted the Auburn–Clemson rivalry the following year in the 2012 Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game. Clemson defeated Auburn 26–19 riding on a 231-yard performance by Andre Ellington. This game was notable due to Sammy Watkins' absence, having been suspended the first two games due to a drug-related arrest in May 2012. Auburn leads the overall series 34–15–2 through the 2018 season.[46] The O'Rourke–McFadden Trophy was created in 2008 by the Boston College Gridiron Club to honor the tradition at both schools and to honor the legacy of Charlie O'Rourke and Banks McFadden, who played during the leather helmet era. The club plans to make this an annual presentation. Clemson first met Boston College on the football field in the 1940 Cotton Bowl Classic, the first ever bowl game for the Tigers and Eagles. Over the next 43 years, the teams met a total of 14 times. In 2005, Boston College joined the ACC and the Atlantic Division. Since then, the game has been played on an annual basis with Clemson winning the last 11 meetings. As of 2022 the Tigers lead the series 21–9–2.[47] Between 1999 and 2007 the ACC Atlantic Division matchup between Clemson and Florida State was referred to as the \"Bowden Bowl\" to reflect the father-son head coach matchup between Bobby Bowden (Father, FSU) and Tommy Bowden (Son, Clemson). Their first meeting, in 1999, was the first time in Division I-A history that a father and a son met as opposing head coaches in a football game. Bobby Bowden won the first four matchups extending FSU's winning streak over Clemson to 11 dating back to 1992. Since 2003, Clemson is 11–6, including a 26–10 win in Clemson over then-No. 3 FSU. Also during this time the Tigers recorded a 27–20 win in Tallahassee in 2006 which broke a 17-year losing streak in Doak Campbell Stadium. 2007 was the last Bowden Bowl game as Tommy resigned as head coach in October 2008. No. 3 Clemson pulled off a thriller in Tallahassee in 2016, 37–34, over the No. 12-ranked Seminoles. In 2018, No. 2 Clemson defeated Florida State in Tallahassee 59–10, which tied the Seminoles' worst loss margin in history. This marked a 2nd time the Tigers have beaten the Seminoles by more than 17-points. Clemson did it again in 2019, beating FSU 45–14. FSU has defeated Clemson by more than 17-points nine times. The most lopsided contest occurred in 1993, with the FSU squad winning 57–0. As of 2022, Florida State leads the overall series 20–15.[48] Before the dissolution of divisions in ACC Football as of 2023, the annual Clemson-Florida State game often decided which team would represent the Atlantic Division in the ACC Championship. However, under the ACC's new scheduling system, Clemson and Florida State are designated as permanent rivals and will continue to compete for the title every year. Because of the new ACC scheduling system, there is a chance these rivals could face each other a second time in the ACC Championship. The Bulldogs and the Tigers have played each other 64 times beginning in 1897, with the 64th meeting played in 2014. Clemson's only regular-season losses of the 1978, 1982, and 1991 campaigns all came at the hands of Georgia \"between the hedges\", whereas Georgia's only regular-season setback during the three years of the Herschel Walker era came in Death Valley during Danny Ford's 1981 national championship run. During the two programs' simultaneous glory days of the early 1980s, no rivalry in all of college football was more important at the national level.[49] The Bulldogs and Tigers played each other every season from 1973 to 1987, with Scott Woerner's dramatic returns in 1980 and the nine turnovers forced by the Tigers in 1981 effectively settling the eventual national champion. No rivalry of that period was more competitive, as evidenced by the critical 11th-hour field goals kicked by Kevin Butler in 1984 and by David Treadwell more than once later in the decade. Despite blowouts in 1990 by the Tigers and in 1994 and 2003 by the Bulldogs, the series typically has remained very competitive with evenly matched games. Most recently, Georgia defeated Clemson 10–3 in the 2021 Duke's Mayo Classic with neither team scoring an offensive touchdown; Georgia went on to win the national title in 2021. The Bulldogs maintains a 43–18–4 lead in the series.[50] Clemson's rivalry with Georgia Tech dates to 1898 with the first game being played in Augusta, Georgia.[51] Notably, both programs share the privilege of having John Heisman as a former coach. It was played in Atlanta for 44 of the first 47 match-ups, until Georgia Tech joined the ACC. When the Yellowjackets joined the ACC in 1978, the series moved to a more traditional home-and-home setup beginning with the 1983 game. When the ACC expanded to 12 teams and split into two divisions in 2005, Clemson and Georgia Tech were placed in opposite divisions but were designated permanent cross-divisional rivals so that the series may continue uninterrupted. In the new system without divisions, they remain as such. The two schools are 127 miles apart and connected to each other by Interstate 85. This distance is slightly closer than that between Clemson and traditional rival South Carolina (137 miles). Georgia Tech leads the series 50–35–2 with Clemson winning the last 8 in a row.[52] The yearly conference and divisional match-up with NC State is known as the Textile Bowl for the schools' similar missions in research and development for the textile industry in the Carolinas. The first meeting of the two schools occurred in 1899. Clemson has won 18 out of 23 contests since 2000. It is a particularly bitter rivalry amongst fans and students of both schools, even though it is not as competitive as the vitriol would suggest. Clemson holds a 60–30–1 series advantage through the 2023 season. NC State has won 2 out of the last 3 games in the rivalry.[53] The Clemson–South Carolina rivalry, which dates back to 1896, is the largest annual sporting event in terms of ticket sales in the state of South Carolina. From 1896 to 1959, the Clemson–South Carolina game was played on the fairgrounds in Columbia, South Carolina and was referred to as \"Big Thursday.\" Beginning in 1960, an alternating-site format was implemented using both teams' home stadiums. The annual game has since been designated \"The Palmetto Bowl.\"[54] The last eight contests between the programs have been nationally televised (4 on ESPN, 4 on ESPN2). Clemson holds a commanding 73–43-4 lead in the series through the 2022 season.[55] It is often considered one of the most heated rivalries in all of college football, on a similar level to the Auburn-Alabama and Ohio State-Michigan rivalries, respectively.[56] In 1951, the College Football Hall of Fame opened in South Bend, Indiana. Clemson has had 3 players and 4 former coaches inducted into the Hall of Fame.[57] The NCAA recognizes All-Americans selected by the Associated Press (AP), American Football Coaches Association (AFCA), Football Writers Association of America (FWAA), The Sporting News (TSN), and the Walter Camp Football Foundation (WCFF) to determine if a player is regarded as a Consensus or Unanimous All-American. To be selected a Consensus All-American, a player must be chosen to the first team on at least three of the five official selectors as recognized by the NCAA. If a player is named an All-American by all five organizations, he is recognized as a Unanimous All-America. Clemson players have been honored 28 times as Consensus All-Americans, and 6 times as Unanimous All-Americas.[70][71] † Unanimous All-American On July 23, 2002, in celebration of the Atlantic Coast Conference's 50th Anniversary, a 120-member blue ribbon committee selected the Top 50 football players in ACC history. Clemson led all conference schools with the most players selected to the Golden Anniversary team.[72] Each of Clemson's honorees are All-Americans and former NFL players. The nine selectees from Clemson are: Source ESPN[when?] [17][73] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ACC temporarily added Notre Dame as a member for just the 2020 season. Wins and losses to Notre Dame in 2020 count toward standings and all-time records.

                "content": "The history of Clemson Tigers football began in 1896, when Clemson University first fielded a football team. Since 1896, the program has an all-time record of 790–466–44, with a bowl record of 28–22. The program has achieved 3 claimed national titles in 1981, 2016, and 2018. Walter Riggs, often regarded as the \"father of Clemson football,\" brought the sport to Clemson from the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama (now Auburn University). The team's first game, played on Halloween 1896, resulted in a 2–1 record for the inaugural season. Riggs influenced the choice of the team mascot and colors.

His tenure has been characterized by significant achievements, including the establishment of Clemson as a perennial contender in the College Football Playoff. Swinney’s ability to recruit and develop talent, combined with strategic hires like offensive coordinator Chad Morris and defensive coordinator Brent Venables, has sustained Clemson’s success. Notably, under Swinney, Clemson became the first team since 1897 to finish a season 15–0. Walter Riggs can be characterized as the \"Father of Clemson Football\", as he brought the game with him from Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama (now Auburn University). The fact that Auburn and Clemson share the same mascot is no accident. Riggs allowed his players to pick the team mascot and, although he may have influenced their decision, the players chose Tigers because Princeton University had just won the national championship. Riggs helped organize and coach the infant Tiger team in 1896. With little money to spend on uniforms, Riggs brought some of Auburn's old practice uniforms with him, which happened to have orange and navy jerseys.[1] Because the jerseys had gone through a few washboard scrubbings, they were quite faded, the navy worse than the orange. So Riggs made the school's predominant color orange and the faded condition of the navy became the purplish color, officially known today as Regalia.[1] The team played as a member of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA), the first southern athletics conference. When the Tigers traveled to Greenville on Halloween to play Furman in their very first match, only Coach Riggs and backfield player Frank Thompkins had ever seen a football game played. Today in Clemson, the soccer field is named Historic Riggs field after Walter Riggs. Riggs took the team to a 2–1 record in the inaugural year.[2] He then stepped aside at the urging of the military cadets/students, who felt that he should concentrate on his scholastic duties rather than coach the team for free. William M. Williams coached the Tigers in 1897, guiding them to a 2–2 record. The team beat South Carolina for the first time and was state champion.[3] In 1898, John Penton led the Tigers to a 3–1 record. In 1899, when the Clemson Athletic Association could not afford a coaching salary, Riggs again took over the reins, one of only two Clemson football coaches to return to the position after stepping down. The 1899 squad went 4–2. Riggs' overall record of 6–3 gives him a .667 winning percentage. After decade as a Mechanical Engineering professor, he was named acting president of Clemson Agricultural College in 1910, being confirmed by the Board of Trustees as permanent president on March 7, 1911. He served until his untimely death on January 22, 1924, while on a trip to Washington, D.C. to meet with officials of other land grant institutions. Riggs hired John Heisman to coach Clemson. Heisman stayed only four years at Clemson, where he compiled a record of 19–3–2, an .833 percentage, the best in Clemson football history.[4] In four seasons, he had two SIAA titles.[5] In his first season of 1900, he coached the Tigers to their first undefeated season (6–0),[3] and first conference championship, outscoring their opponents 222–10 – the 64–0 win over Davidson on opening day was then the largest score ever made in the South.[6] The season had various other \"firsts\", including the school's first defeat of the Georgia Bulldogs and the Alabama Crimson Tide. The only close game was with the South Atlantic school VPI. The 1902 team again won the SIAA. This was the first season with both Hope Sadler and Carl Sitton at ends. One writer recalls, \"Sitton and Hope Sadler were the finest ends that Clemson ever had perhaps.\"[7] The only loss on the year was the first to rival South Carolina since 1896. The 1903 team may have been Heisman's best at Clemson. Following a 73–0 defeat of Georgia Tech in 1903, the Yellow Jackets hired Heisman as their first full-time football coach. Fullback Jock Hanvey rushed for 104 yards in the first half.[8] The account in the Atlanta Constitution read \"Hanvey, the Clemson full back, outclassed them all. Time and time again he was sent through the line for gains of 10, 15 and 20 yards, and his tackles were spectacular.\"[9] After the 1903 season, Clemson tied 11–11 in a game billed as the \"SIAA Championship Game.\" After Heisman left Clemson to become the head coach at Georgia Tech, Shack Shealy, an end for the Tigers in the 1890s, coached the 1904 team to a 3–3–1 record – the only Clemson graduate ever to serve as head coach of his alma mater. Eddie Cochems, a future innovator of the former pass, had just lost out to Phil King for the Wisconsin job, when he accepted to coach Clemson's 1905 team. The team lost to Vanderbilt and Georgia Tech, but shut out Georgia, Alabama, and Auburn while featuring stars left over from Heisman like Fritz Furtick and Puss Derrick. Bob Williams, who beat Heisman in 1902, came to Clemson in 1906, and also coached the 1909 and 1913 to 1915 teams. The Tigers went undefeated with a 4–0–3 record in 1906, with wins over Georgia, Auburn, Tennessee, and the John Heisman-coached Georgia Tech team. Clemson's first forward pass took place during the game with Tech in Atlanta. Left End Powell Lykes, dropped back to kick, but lobbed a 30-yard pass to George Warren instead. Clemson won, 10–0. The 1909 USC-Clemson was the first game broadcast in the state, by the United Wireless Telegraph Company.[10] William Schilletter starred in 1913 and 1914, and was the son of Augustus \"Shorty\" Schilletter, a German immigrant in charge of the Clemson College dining hall.[11] Frank Shaughnessy led the 1907 team to a. 4–4 record. Captain Mac McLaurin and R. T. Gaston starred at either tackle position. Vanderbilt legend Stein Stone posted just a 1–6 record in 1908. Captain Sticker Coles was All-Southern. Frank Dobson posted 11–12–1 overall record from 1910 to 1912. Wayne Hart had a 3–6 record in 1916. Washington & Lee's Edward Donahue coached the Tigers to 21–12–3 record over three seasons, from 1917 to 1920. Stumpy Banks scored five touchdowns against Furman in 1917 for a school record.[12][13] Yen Lightsey starred in 1919 and 1920. Doc Stewart coached the Tigers through the transition from the SIAA to the Southern Conference, with a 6–10–2 record from 1921 to 1922. Bud Saunders led the Tigers to a 10–22–1 record from 1923 to 1926. Josh Cody coached the Tigers from 1927 to 1930, posting a 29–11–1 record. The Tigers were undefeated at home (13–0–1) and against South Carolina (3–0) during Cody's tenure. In 1927 Cody gave Red Sanders his first coaching job as backfield coach.[14] O. K. Pressley made third-team All-American in 1928. \"A better center than Captain O.K. Pressley of Clemson is hard to find,\" remarked former South Carolina head coach Billy Laval.[15] In May 1929, when rumors were swirling that he might leave to coach a bigger-name program, the students, faculty, and staff took up a collection to buy him a brand new black Buick automobile. Raymond Johnson wrote upon Cody's death: \"Josh Cody wanted to be Vanderbilt's coach so bad that he gave up the head man's job at Clemson College after four successful seasons.\" In 1931, Jess Neely (another McGugin product, and a former head coach at Rhodes College and assistant at Alabama) became Clemson's head football coach. During his tenure, Neely led the Tigers to a 43–35–7 record. His final season at Clemson was the turning point in the Tigers' program. His team went 9–1 during that season, finishing second to Duke in the Southern Conference. The Tigers also received their first bowl invitation and bowl victory that year, defeating nationally ranked Boston College 6–3 in the 1940 Cotton Bowl Classic. The 1939 Tigers finished with a No. 12 ranking in the final AP poll. Clemson also had their first Associated Press All-American that year in Banks McFadden. Jess Neely, along with then athletic director Rupert Fike, founded the IPTAY Scholarship Fund, which supports the Clemson Athletic Department. An acronym for \"I Pay Ten A Year,\" as that was what it asked boosters to donate when founded in 1934, IPTAY has since grown into one of the largest and most comprehensive collegiate sporting funds in the nation and a model for other programs. After Jess Neely left to become the head coach at Rice, his line coach, Frank Howard was named his successor. Known for his colorful persona, and penchant for imaginative language with both probable, and improbable stories, in his 30 years at Clemson, Howard compiled a 165–118–12 record, a 3–3 bowl record, won two Southern Conference championships, and six ACC championships. Seven of Howard's teams finished the year ranked in at least one final poll. During his stay at Clemson, Howard also oversaw the athletic department, ticket sales, and was an assistant coach for the baseball team. He also incorporated the Single Wing, T-formation, and I-formation offenses at different points during his coaching career at Clemson. In the sterling 1948 season, the team won a Southern Conference championship (Howard's first of eight). The Tigers also won their second bowl game, a 1948 Gator Bowl win over Missouri, finished 11th in the national rankings, and Howard was named Southern Conference Coach of the Year. For the rest of his life, Howard credited the 1948 team with saving his job. Howard nearly repeated the 1948 success in 1950 when the Tigers were ranked tenth by the Associated Press with a 9–0–1 season and a 15–14 win over Miami (Florida) in Clemson's first Orange Bowl win. In January 1952, after a 7–2 regular season campaign, the Tigers were invited back to the Gator Bowl, and by being conference champions once again in 1956, Clemson played in the 1957 Orange Bowl. In their second Gator Bowl trip, Miami downed Clemson 14–0. Colorado led Clemson 20–0, then trailed 21–20, in a comeback game, before finally defeating the Tigers 27–21 in the 1957 Orange Bowl. Two season's later, after an 8–3 season, the Tigers played in the 1959 Sugar Bowl and with their tough defense, held the No. 1-ranked LSU Tigers to a standstill before losing 7–0, leading to an LSU national championship.[16] The invitation to play in the inaugural Bluebonnet Bowl in December 1959 was the eighth bowl that Howard had been a part of either as a player, assistant coach or head coach. It was the seventh bowl trip for a Clemson team and the sixth in 12 years. Howard said that Clemson's 23–7 triumph over seventh-ranked Texas Christian was the best performance he had ever witnessed by a Clemson team.[citation needed] In 1959 he was named Atlantic Coast Conference Coach of the Year and was accorded the honor again in 1966. As the style of football evolved in the 1960s, Howard's ground game became outdated, and Clemson's gridiron fortunes declined. The Tigers last winning season under Howard came in 1967. On December 10, 1969, he stepped down as the fifth winningest coach in the nation.[citation needed] Howard also managed the athletic department during his tenure, and continued on as athletic director until February 4, 1971, when he was named assistant to the vice president of the university. On June 30, 1974, he retired from the university payroll, but continued to come into his office daily until failing health slowed him down, serving as Clemson's ambassador until his death in 1996.[17] The tradition of rubbing \"Howard's Rock\" prior to running down the hill before home games began during Coach Howard's tenure.[18] The playing field at Memorial Stadium was named \"Frank Howard Field\" in 1974 following his retirement to honor his many years of service for the university.[19] Clemson struggled during the years following Frank Howard's retirement. His successor, Hootie Ingram, only compiled a 12–21 record.[20][21] During his tenure, the tradition of running down the hill was stopped from 1970 to the end of the 1972 season, when the team decided it wanted to come down the hill for the final home game against South Carolina.[22][23] The traditional \"tiger paw\" logo, which was designed by John Antonio of Henderson Advertising, was introduced in 1970 by Ingram and Clemson President R.C. Edwards.[24] After a successful run as head coach of The Citadel from 1966 to 1972, Jimmy \"Red\" Parker coached the Tigers from 1973 to 1976, compiling a 17–25–2 record.[25] Clemson had a 7–4 season under Parker in 1974, with Parker being named ACC Coach of the Year. The Tigers went 2–9 in 1975, and 3–6–2 in 1976. Red Parker was cut loose by the board of trustees at the end of the Bicentennial season. Athletic Director Bill McClellan got the task of informing Parker he was gone when Parker refused to fire his assistants. Though Parker is largely credited with building and recruiting a foundation that would ultimately set the stage for much of Clemson's success in the following seasons.[26] Using some of the talent enrolled during the Parker seasons, Charley Pell coached the Tigers for two seasons, winning the ACC Coach of the Year award twice and leading the Tigers to the 1978 ACC Championship en route to an 18–4–1 record. Dual-threat quarterback Steve Fuller and the running back tandem of Lester Brown and Marvin Sims spearheaded a dynamic rushing attack that helped the Tigers win the ACC. The only loss came in Week 2 against SEC power Georgia, and, after a Gator Bowl win over No. 20 Ohio State, Clemson posted its second-best final AP poll finish in school history with a No. 6 ranking. In both seasons, Clemson earned berths to the Gator Bowl, although Pell left before the latter game. Pell became involved in NCAA rules and recruiting violations that came to light under the tenure of his successor, Danny Ford. Charlie Pell would leave after 1978 to become head coach at Florida,[27] where his coaching career would end in 1984 following more NCAA rules violations.[28] Danny Ford was promoted from offensive line coach to head coach in 1978, after Charlie Pell left for the University of Florida. He won his first game, the 1978 Gator Bowl, with a 17–15 victory over Ohio State and legendary coach Woody Hayes, who punched MG Charlie Bauman in the throat after making the game-clinching interception.[29] In his third season, Ford guided Clemson to the summit of college football by winning the National Championship, and recording the program's fifth undefeated season. The Tigers, who were unranked in the preseason, downed three top-10 teams (Georgia, North Carolina and Nebraska) during the course of the 12–0 season that concluded with a 22–15 victory over Nebraska in the 1982 Orange Bowl. Ford, named National Coach-of-the-Year in 1981, holds the record as the youngest coach (33 years old) to win a national championship on the gridiron.[30] Ranked No. 10 before the 1982 season began, Clemson finish with the regular season with a record of 9–1–1.[31] After the No. 8 Tigers received a bid to the Cotton Bowl with only one loss on the season, the senior class voted to decline the invitation. On November 22, 1982, the football program at Clemson was placed on probation for a 2-year period to include the 1983 and 1984 seasons.[32] This NCAA sanction was due to a lengthy history of recruiting violations to gain an athletic advantage that had taken place from 1977 and into 1982, under the administration of two head coaches. More than 150 documented violations and 69 charges were cited under NCAA bylaws in the categories of improper recruiting inducements, extra benefits to student-athletes, ethical conduct, improper financial aid, improper campus visits, improper transportation and entertainment, improper use of funds, improper employment, and improper recruiting contact.[33] Clemson was censured by the NCAA including barred from participating in bowl games following the 1982 and 1983 seasons, barred from appearing on live television in the 1983 and 1984 seasons, while scholarships were restricted to 20 (from the normal limit of 30) for the 1983–84 and 1984–85 academic years.[34] Charles Alan Wright, chairman of the NCAA Committee on Infractions said at the time, \"Due to the large number and serious nature of the violations in this case, the committee believed that institutional sanctions related to appearances on television and in postseason football bowl games were appropriate. In addition, because the violations indicated a pattern of improper recruiting activities, the committee determined that a two-year limitation on financial aid to new recruits should be imposed to offset any recruiting advantage that was gained improperly by the university.\"[34] The reduction of scholarships could be felt in the next two seasons, as Clemson posted a 7–4 season in 1984 and an even 6–6 campaign in 1985. From 1987 to 1990, Clemson posted four consecutive 10 win seasons and won three straight ACC titles, including a 35–10 victory over Penn State and a 13–6 defeat of Oklahoma in the 1989 Florida Citrus Bowl. At that time, no team in Clemson history started higher in the AP poll than the 1988 team beginning the year as the No. 4-ranked team in the nation and a preseason favorite to win the national title.[citation needed] Five years after their first probation under Ford ended, Clemson once again found their football program accused of multiple recruiting violations in January 1990.[35] The NCAA accused Clemson coaches of committing 14 rules violations, including giving cash to players and having illegal contact with recruits over a period from 1984 to 1988.[36] Shortly after, Ford submitted a forced resignation. The NCAA later cleared Clemson of all allegations.[37][36] Ford coached 21 All-Americans and 41 players who went on to play in the NFL, during his 11 seasons at Clemson.[citation needed] After a few years away from coaching, Ford was hired by Arkansas in 1992, where he would spend five seasons guiding the Razorbacks. In 2017, Ford was named to the College Football Hall of Fame.[38] Ken Hatfield, former coach at Air Force and Arkansas, took over as head coach at Clemson in January 1990.[39] He had a 32–13–1 record with the Tigers and led them to three bowl games. Hatfield worked to clean up the program's image in the wake of the Ford-era sanctions.[40] However, in the wake of Ford's success, Hatfield and many in the Clemson fanbase did not see eye-to-eye. A common saying among Tiger fans during this time was \"Howard built it. Ford filled it. Hatfield killed it.\" This sentiment followed Clemson's first losing season (1992) since 1976. Largely due to this discontent, school officials refused to grant him a one-year extension on his contract after the 1993 season, even though the Tigers had rebounded from 5–6 in 1992 to an 8–3 record that year and were invited to the Peach Bowl. Expressing \"much disappointment\" in what he saw as a lack of support by Clemson fans and several university officials, Hatfield resigned at the end of the regular season.[41] He was later hired at Rice. The purple home jerseys used by Clemson in special games made their debut during the 1991 ACC championship season, with the Tigers wearing them in the regular season against NC State and in the Citrus Bowl vs. California. Tommy West replaced Ken Hatfield at the end of the 1993 season, coaching the Tigers to a 14–13 victory in the 1993 Peach Bowl against Kentucky. West had a 31–28 record during his five seasons at Clemson and led the Tigers to three bowl games but no ACC championships. West was fired after a dismal 1998 campaign which saw Clemson go 3–8 and finish last in the ACC. West went on to be the head coach at Memphis. After Tommy West's dismissal following the 1998 season, Clemson hired Tommy Bowden, son of Bobby Bowden and coach at Tulane. Bowden led the Tigers to a 6–6 record and a Peach Bowl bid in 1999, with the team that navigated its way through a schedule that included MAC champions and undefeated Marshall, Big East champion and BCS runner-up Virginia Tech (who went undefeated during the regular season), and eventual National Champion Florida State (who finished the year undefeated). The 1999 meeting between the Tigers and Seminoles was dubbed the \"Bowden Bowl\" and was the first time that a father and son coached against each other in Division I football. FSU won the game 17– 14 in front of the largest crowd in the history of Death Valley.[42] During Bowden's tenure, the Tigers were bowl eligible every season but didn't win any ACC championships (the 2004 team turned down a bowl invitation as punishment for a massive brawl during a game against the University of South Carolina). Bowden has been criticized for his teams underachieving. The 2000 Tigers started 8–0 and rose as high as No. 5 in the polls before losing three of their last four. The same thing happened during the 2006 season following a 7–1 start and with the team on the verge of winning the ACC Atlantic Division. The Tigers have also shown great resolve at points during Bowden's tenure. The 2003 team won four games at the end of the season to finish 9–4, which included victories over No. 3 Florida State and No. 7 Tennessee in the Chick-Fil-A Peach Bowl. The 2004 season saw the Tigers start 1–4 only to win five of their last six games (which included an overtime upset of No. 10 Miami), while the 2005 team overcame a 2–3 start to finish the season 9–4. Tommy Bowden agreed to resign for $3.5 million on October 13, 2008, after leading the team to a disappointing 3–3 record (1–2 ACC) at the midpoint of a season in which the Tigers were an almost unanimous preseason pick to win their first ACC title under Bowden and were ranked No. 9 in the preseason polls.[43] Assistant coach Dabo Swinney was named interim head coach.[44] Following the departure of Tommy Bowden, wide receivers coach Dabo Swinney was dubbed interim head coach and led the Tigers to a 4–2 record, finishing the 2008 regular season at 7–6. On December 1, Clemson removed the \"interim\" tag from Swinney's title and named him the 27th head coach in school history, with a five-year contract.[45] On November 21, 2009, Swinney and the Tigers qualified for their first ACC title game berth, only to lose to the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets 39–34.[46] They were awarded a trip to the 2009 Music City Bowl, and defeated the Kentucky Wildcats 21–13, avenging their upset loss in the 2006 Music City Bowl.[47] During the 2010 season, after a close 24–27 overtime loss to national champion Auburn on the road, Clemson was later defeated in the Meineke Car Care Bowl in Charlotte, North Carolina.[48] In January 2011, Swinney hired new offensive coordinator Chad Morris. Morris became tied with Gus Malzahn as the highest paid assistant in college football after Clemson gave Morris a six-year contract worth $1.3 million annually.[49] Dabo also added on running backs coach Tony Elliott, and defensive line coach Marion Hobby. On September 17, 2011, Clemson beat the defending national champions, the No. 21-ranked Auburn Tigers, and ended Auburn's 17-game winning streak, the longest winning streak in the nation.[50] On October 1, 2011, Clemson became the first ACC team to beat three nationally ranked opponents in a row: No. 21-ranked Auburn, No. 11-ranked Florida State, and No. 11-ranked Virginia Tech.[51] On November 12, 2011, Clemson defeated Wake Forest, winning the ACC Atlantic Division title.[52] On November 26, 2011, Clemson lost to South Carolina for the third straight year, the first time Clemson had lost three straight to its instate rival since the seasons from 1968 to 1970.[53] On December 3, the Tigers won their first ACC Championship since 1991, defeating Virginia Tech 38–10 in the Championship Game.[54] However, in the 2012 Orange Bowl, their first major-bowl appearance since the 1981 national championship season, No. 15 Clemson was routed by No. 23 West Virginia 70–33, giving up an all-time record number of points scored in a quarter (35), half (49) and game (70) in the 109-year history of bowl games.[55] On December 31, 2012, Clemson achieved its first 11-win season since the national championship year with a last-second upset win over the No. 8 LSU Tigers in the Chick-fil-A Bowl. Clemson trailed 24–13 in the fourth quarter, but rallied back with a game-winning drive that saw a 4th and 16 conversion deep in their own territory that would lead to Chandler Catanzaro's 37-yard field goal as time expired to give Clemson a 25–24 win.[56] The 2013 season was historic for the Clemson football program. The Tigers began the season with a 38–35 home victory over rival and fifth-ranked Georgia and ended the regular season with a record fifth-straight loss to arch-rival South Carolina, 31–17, in the first Top 10 meeting of the two schools (Clemson No. 4, Carolina No. 9).[57][58] The Tigers finished 11–2 in 2013 and secured the school's first ever BCS bowl win with a 40–35 victory over No. 7 Ohio State in the Orange Bowl. Quarterback Tajh Boyd and wide receiver Sammy Watkins set Orange Bowl yardage records. Boyd compiled 505 total yards and threw five touchdowns. It was the Tigers fourth win over a top 10 opponent under Swinney.[59] Clemson finished 10–3 in 2014, highlighted by a 35–17 win over arch-rival South Carolina and a 40–6 win over Oklahoma in the Russell Athletic Bowl.[60] The Tigers took on ACC rival Florida State in week 3 of their season only to suffer a loss in overtime as No. 22 Clemson lost to No. 1 Florida State 17–23.[61] The Tigers then claimed a six-game winning streak in the middle of their season but lost to Georgia Tech as star freshman quarterback Deshaun Watson went out with a knee injury early in the 1st quarter.[62] The Tigers claimed the nation's number 1-ranked defense under defensive coordinator Brent Venables in 2014,[63] and the emergence of freshman quarterback Deshaun Watson propelled the Tigers to another 10-win season for the 4th time in Dabo Swinney's six years as head coach. The 2015 season is regarded by sports writers as one of the most successful seasons in Clemson history.[64] The Tigers possessed the nation's number 1 ranking throughout the second half of the regular season and ended with 14–1 overall record. Behind the leadership of Heisman Trophy finalist Deshaun Watson, the Tigers won the 2015 ACC Championship against number 10 North Carolina by a score of 45–37.[65] The Tigers were selected to participate in the 2016 College Football Playoff as the top-seeded team in the tournament. Clemson defeated the No. 4 ranked Oklahoma Sooners in the 2015 Orange Bowl by a score of 37–17 to advance to the 2016 College Football Playoff National Championship game against the number 2-ranked Alabama Crimson Tide on January 11, 2016.[66] Clemson lost the 2016 College Football Playoff National Championship Game to Alabama, 45–40 ending the school's 17-game winning streak. Heisman finalist quarterback Deshaun Watson had a historic performance setting the record for most total yards in national championship game history, with 478 yards (405 passing; 73 rushing) against the nation's best defense, and becoming the first player in history to amass over 4,000 yards passing and 1,000 yards rushing in a single season.[67] In August 2016, ESPN.com reported that the 2016–2017 preseason Coaches Top 25 poll ranked Clemson Tigers football as the No. 2 team in the nation.[68] With a loaded offense and plenty of young talent waiting to emerge on defense, Clemson entered 2016 as one of the frontrunners to contend for the national championship.[69] Clemson once again won the conference and finished the regular season at 12–1. Clemson finished the season with wins at Auburn, Georgia Tech, and No. 12 Florida State on the road and defeated No. 3 Louisville in Memorial Stadium.[70] The Tigers suffered a 43–42 home loss to Pitt in November, but benefited from losses by a couple of other playoff contenders on that Saturday and finished the season with three straight victories to rank No. 2 in the final CFP rankings.[71][72][73] As expected from last season's returning starters, quarterback Deshaun Watson anchored an explosive offense that averaged 503 yards per game.[74] The defense reloaded behind a standout defensive line and limited opponents to just 18.4 points a game.[75] Clemson finished with a regular season record of 12–1, which culminated with a 56–7 win at home over arch-rival South Carolina, Swinney's largest margin of victory over the Gamecocks during his career.[76] Clemson won the ACC championship and secured its second trip to the CFP National Championship with a 31–0 shutout of semi-finalist No. 3 Ohio State in the 2016 Fiesta Bowl.[77] The Tigers competed in the College Football Playoff National Championship game in Tampa, Florida on January 9, 2017, beating the previously undefeated Alabama Crimson Tide 35–31 on a game-winning touchdown with one second remaining, and winning the 2016 National Championship. Swinney capped off a historical season in 2018 as the Tigers finished 15–0, marking the first time a college team had done so since 1897.[78] Clemson defeated No. 1 ranked Alabama 44–16 in the CFP National Championship. The Tigers recorded the most wins in a single season for Clemson. Freshman quarterback Trevor Lawrence threw for 347 yards and 3 touchdowns in the Tigers' rout of the Crimson Tide. The Tigers also defeated No. 3 Notre Dame 30–3 in the Cotton Bowl in the semi-finals of the playoff. It was Clemson's second national title in three years and the third in school history. Clemson began the 2019 NCAA Division I FBS football season with high expectations, having received the pre-season No. 1 ranking in both the AP and Coaches' polls. However, Clemson had a sluggish start to the season culminating in a scare against North Carolina, where Clemson had to stop the Tarheels on a two-point conversion to escape Chapel Hill with a win. Trevor Lawrence struggled to begin the season, however, he began to hit his stride following the match up against Louisville, after he which he led the NCAA in multiple passing categories and failed to throw an interception the rest of the season. Clemson went on to capture both their fifth straight ACC Atlantic Division and ACC conference title, having defeated Virginia in the 2019 ACC Championship Game by a score of 62–17. Clemson finished a second straight year with an undefeated regular season, having also defeated South Carolina for a sixth straight time. Clemson received a berth to the 2019 Fiesta Bowl (December) against the Ohio State Buckeyes, their fifth straight College Football Playoff appearance. They defeated Ohio State by a score of 29–23, with Lawrence leading the team on a 94-yard drive culminating in a touchdown pass to Travis Etienne to take the lead in the end of the game and Buckeye quarterback Justin Fields throwing an interception in the Clemson end zone to seal the victory for the Tigers. Clemson then played the LSU Tigers in the 2020 College Football Playoff National Championship. LSU eventually took the lead and run away with the championship, winning 42–25 over Clemson. Clemson finished the 2019 season 14–1 and No. 2 in both polls. This was the Tigers' fifth straight season finishing in the top 4 for either poll. Clemson also ended a 29-game winning streak that was the nation's longest from 2018 to 2019. For the 2020 season, Clemson was again ranked pre-season No. 1 by both the AP and the Coaches' polls.[79][80] In June, 37 players tested positive for COVID during voluntary workouts.[81] Standout defensive end Xavier Thomas announced he would redshirt the season due to the effects of the virus.[82] In the 2021 season, Clemson was stuck in the offense, lost 3 games, and missed the playoff berth first time since 2015. In the Cheez-It Bowl of 2021 season,[83] they beat Iowa State 20–13.[84] In 2022, Clemson defeated Syracuse 27–21, extending the Tigers' home winning streak to 38, a new ACC record.[85] However, in the 2022 Palmetto Bowl, Clemson's ACC record home-winning streak came to an end with a 31–30 loss to archrival South Carolina.[86] After the 2022 season, Swinney fired offensive coordinator Brandon Streeter[87][88][89] and replaced him with 2022 Broyles Award winner Garrett Riley.[90][91][92][93]",

Ten of the nominations were unveiled exclusively on \"CBS Mornings.\" \"Emilia Pérez,\" the French director Jacques Audiard's musical crime-thriller starring Zoe Saldaña and Selena Gomez, leads the Golden Globes nominations this year, with 10 nods overall for its acting, directing, writing and music. After that, the top film competitors were \"The Brutalist,\" with seven nominations, and \"Conclave,\" with six. Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley's buzzy body horror satire \"The Substance\" and the independent rom-com \"Anora\" followed with five nods each. \"The Bear,\" \"Only Murders in the Building\" and \"Shōgun\" — all from Hulu — emerged as frontrunners for television. \"The Bear\" earned five nominations, while the other two series each got four. The announcement capped a big year for TV and film. Over the summer, \"Inside Out 2\" topped \"Frozen 2\" to become the highest-grossing animated film ever.

                "title": "Taylor Swift - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Known for her biographical songwriting, artistic reinventions, and cultural impact, Swift is a leading figure in popular music and the subject of widespread public interest. Swift signed to Big Machine Records in 2005 starting as a country singer with the albums Taylor Swift (2006) and Fearless (2008). Her singles \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Love Story\", and \"You Belong with Me\" found crossover success on country and pop radio formats. She experimented with rock on Speak Now (2010) and electronic on Red (2012), later re-calibrating her image from country to pop with the synth-pop album 1989 (2014); the ensuing media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-imbued Reputation (2017). The albums contained the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", \"Bad Blood\" and \"Look What You Made Me Do\". Shifting to Republic Records in 2018, Swift released the electropop album Lover (2019) and the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020), explored indie folk styles in the 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, and subdued pop genres on Midnights (2022) and The Tortured Poets Department (2024). She began re-recording her Big Machine albums as Taylor's Version[a] since 2021, due to an ownership dispute with the label. Through the 2020s, she garnered the US number one songs \"Cardigan\", \"Willow\", \"All Too Well\", \"Anti-Hero\", \"Cruel Summer\", \"Is It Over Now?\", and \"Fortnight\". Her sixth concert tour, the Eras Tour (2023–2024), and its accompanying concert film are respectively the highest-grossing tour and concert film of all time. Her fans are known as Swifties. Swift is one of the world's best-selling music artists, with over 200 million units sold and a record seven albums that moved one million copies first-week. She is the highest-grossing female touring act, the first billionaire with music as primary income, and the world's richest female musician. She has been listed amongst history's greatest artists by publications such as Rolling Stone, Billboard and Forbes, as well as the only individual from the arts to have been named the Time Person of the Year (2023). Her accolades include 14 Grammy Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, 40 American Music Awards, 40 Billboard Music Awards, and 30 MTV Video Music Awards, having won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year and the IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year at least four times each. She is an advocate of artists' rights and women's empowerment. Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in West Reading, Pennsylvania.[1] She is named after the singer-songwriter James Taylor.[2][3] Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, was a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch, and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), worked as a mutual fund marketing executive.[4] Swift's younger brother, Austin, is an actor.[5] Their maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay (née Moehlenkamp), was an opera singer,[6] whose singing in church became one of Swift's earliest memories of music that shaped her career.[4] Swift is of Scottish, English, and German descent, with distant Italian and Irish ancestry.[7][8][9] Swift spent her early years on a Christmas tree farm in Pennsylvania that her father had purchased from one of his clients,[10] and she spent her summers at her family's vacation home in Stone Harbor, New Jersey, where she occasionally performed acoustic songs at a local coffee shop.[11] She is a Christian[12] and attended preschool and kindergarten at a Montessori school run by the Bernardine Sisters of St. Francis before transferring to the Wyndcroft School.[13][14] When her family moved to Wyomissing, she attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.[15][16] As a child, she performed in Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions[17] and traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons.[18] Her early love for country music was influenced by Shania Twain, Patsy Cline, LeAnn Rimes, and the Dixie Chicks,[14] and she spent weekends performing at local festivals and events.[19][20] After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, she became determined to pursue a country-music career in Nashville, Tennessee.[21] At 11, Swift traveled to Nashville with her mother to visit record labels and submit demo tapes of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers.[22] She was rejected by all the labels, which led her to focus on songwriting.[23] She started learning the guitar at 12 with the help of Ronnie Cremer, a computer repairman and local musician who also assisted Swift with writing an original song.[24] In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with the talent manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch and had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD.[25] After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, 13-year-old Swift was given an artist development deal and began to travel regularly to Nashville with her mother.[26][27] To help Swift break into the country music scene, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch's Nashville office when she was 14 years old, and the family relocated to Hendersonville, Tennessee.[28][29] Swift attended Hendersonville High School[30] before transferring to Aaron Academy after two years, which better accommodated her touring schedule through homeschooling. She graduated one year early.[3][31] In Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers[32][33] and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.[34] They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[35] Rose called the sessions \"some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks.\" Swift became the youngest artist signed by Sony/ATV Tree Music Publishing,[36] but left then BMG-owned RCA Records (later bought by Sony Music) at the age of 14 due to the label's lack of care and them \"cut[ting] other people's stuff\". She was also concerned that development deals can shelve artists[27][20] and recalled: \"I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through.\"[37] At an industry showcase at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had first met Borchetta in 2004.[39] She was one of Big Machine's first signings,[27] and her father purchased a three-percent stake in the company for an estimated $120,000.[40][41][42] She began working on her eponymous debut album with Nathan Chapman.[20] Swift wrote or co-wrote all album tracks, and co-writers included Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia.[43] Released in October 2006, Taylor Swift peaked at number five on the US Billboard 200, on which it spent 157 weeks—the longest stay on the chart by any release in the US in the 2000s decade.[44][45] Swift became the first female country music artist to write or co-write every track on a platinum-certified debut album.[46] Big Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, \"Tim McGraw\", which Swift and her mother helped promote by packaging and sending copies of the CD single to country radio stations.[47] She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour and television appearances; she opened for Rascal Flatts on select dates during their 2006 tour,[48] as a replacement for Eric Church.[49] Borchetta said that although record industry peers initially disapproved of his signing a 15-year-old singer-songwriter, Swift tapped into a previously unknown market—teenage girls who listen to country music.[47][28] Following \"Tim McGraw\", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Our Song\", \"Picture to Burn\", and \"Should've Said No\". All appeared on Billboard's Hot Country Songs, with \"Our Song\" and \"Should've Said No\" reaching number one. \"Our Song\" made Swift the youngest person to single-handedly write and sing a Hot Country Songs number-one single,[50] and \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" was Swift's breakthrough single on mainstream radio and charts.[51][52][53] Swift released two EPs, The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection in October 2007 and Beautiful Eyes in July 2008.[54][55] She promoted her debut album extensively as the opening act for other country musicians' tours in 2006 and 2007, including those by George Strait,[56] Brad Paisley,[57] and Tim McGraw and Faith Hill.[58] Swift won multiple accolades for Taylor Swift. She was one of the recipients of the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist of the Year in 2007, becoming the youngest person given the title.[59] She also won the Country Music Association's Horizon Award for Best New Artist,[60] the Academy of Country Music Awards' Top New Female Vocalist,[61] and the American Music Awards' Favorite Country Female Artist honor.[62] She was also nominated for Best New Artist at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards.[63] In 2008, she opened for Rascal Flatts again[64] and briefly dated the singer Joe Jonas.[65] Swift's second studio album, Fearless, was released in November 2008 in North America,[66] and in March 2009 in other markets.[67] On the Billboard 200, Fearless spent 11 weeks at number one, becoming Swift's first chart topper and the longest-running number-one female country album.[68] It was the bestselling album of 2009 in the US.[69] Its lead single, \"Love Story\", was her first number one in Australia and the first country song to top Billboard's Pop Songs chart,[70][71] and its third single, \"You Belong with Me\", was the first country song to top Billboard's all-genre Radio Songs chart.[72] Three other singles were released in 2008–2010: \"White Horse\", \"Fifteen\", and \"Fearless\". All five singles were Hot Country Songs top 10 entries, with \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" topping the chart.[73] In 2009, Swift toured as an opening act for Keith Urban and embarked on her first headlining tour, the Fearless Tour.[74] \"You Belong with Me\" won Best Female Video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.[75] Her acceptance speech was interrupted by the rapper Kanye West, an incident that became the subject of controversy and widespread media coverage.[76] That year, Swift won five American Music Awards, including Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[77] Billboard named her the 2009 Artist of the Year.[78] She won Video of the Year and Female Video of the Year for \"Love Story\" at the 2009 CMT Music Awards, where she made a parody video of the song with rapper T-Pain called \"Thug Story\".[79] At the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, Fearless was named Album of the Year and Best Country Album, and \"White Horse\" won Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance.[80] At the 2009 Country Music Association Awards, Swift won Album of the Year for Fearless and was named Entertainer of the Year, the youngest person to win the honor.[81] Throughout 2009, Swift featured on and wrote other musicians' releases. She featured on \"Half of My Heart\" by John Mayer, whom she was romantically linked with in late 2009.[82][83] She wrote \"Best Days of Your Life\" for Kellie Pickler,[84] co-wrote and featured on Boys Like Girls' \"Two Is Better Than One,[85] and wrote two songs—\"You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home\" and \"Crazier\"—for the soundtrack of Hannah Montana: The Movie, in which she had a cameo appearance.[86][87] She wrote and recorded \"Today Was a Fairytale\" for the soundtrack of Valentine's Day (2010), in which she had her acting debut.[88] \"Today Was a Fairytale\" was her first number-one single on the Canadian Hot 100.[89] While shooting Valentine's Day in October 2009, Swift dated co-star Taylor Lautner.[90] On television, she made her debut as a rebellious teenager in an CSI: Crime Scene Investigation episode[91] and hosted and performed as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live; she was the first host ever to write their own opening monologue.[92][93] Swift's third studio album, Speak Now, was released in October 2010.[94] Written solely by Swift,[95] the album debuted the Billboard 200 with over one million US copies sold first week[96] and became the fastest-selling digital album by a female artist.[97] Speak Now was supported by six singles: \"Mine\", \"Back to December\", \"Mean\", \"The Story of Us\", \"Sparks Fly\", and \"Ours\". \"Mine\" peaked at number three and was the highest-charting single on the Billboard Hot 100,[98] the first three singles reached the top 10 in Canada,[89] and the last two reached number one on Hot Country Songs.[73] Swift promoted Speak Now with the Speak Now World Tour from February 2011 to March 2012[99] and the live album Speak Now World Tour – Live.[100] At the 54th Annual Grammy Awards in 2012, Swift performed \"Mean\", which won Best Country Song and Best Country Solo Performance.[101] She was named Songwriter/Artist of the Year by the Nashville Songwriters Association (2010 and 2011),[102][103] Woman of the Year by Billboard (2011),[104] and Entertainer of the Year by the Academy of Country Music (2011 and 2012)[105] and the Country Music Association in 2011.[106] At the American Music Awards of 2011, Swift won Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[107] Rolling Stone named Speak Now on its list of \"50 Best Female Albums of All Time\" (2012).[108] Red, Swift's fourth studio album, was released in October 2012.[109] On Red, Swift worked with Chapman and new producers including Max Martin, Shellback, Dan Wilson, Jeff Bhasker, Dann Huff, and Butch Walker, resulting in a genre-spanning record that incorporated eclectic styles of pop and rock such as Britrock, dubstep, and dance-pop.[110][111] The album opened at number one on the Billboard 200 with 1.21 million sales[112] and was Swift's first number-one album in the UK.[113] Its lead single, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", was her first number one on the Billboard Hot 100,[114] and its third single, \"I Knew You Were Trouble\", reached the top five on charts worldwide.[115] Other singles from Red were \"Begin Again\", \"22\", \"Everything Has Changed\", \"The Last Time\", and \"Red\".[116] Red and its single \"Begin Again\" received three nominations at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards (2014).[117] Swift received American Music Awards for Best Female Country Artist in 2012, Artist of the Year in 2013,[118][119] and the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist Award for the fifth and sixth consecutive years.[120] At the 2014 Country Music Association Awards, Swift was honored with the Pinnacle Award, making her the second recipient in history after Garth Brooks.[121] The Red Tour ran from March 2013 to June 2014 and became the highest-grossing country tour upon completion.[122] Swift continued writing songs for films and featuring on other artists' releases. On the soundtrack album to The Hunger Games (2012), Swift wrote and recorded \"Eyes Open\" and \"Safe & Sound\"; the latter of which was co-written with the Civil Wars and T-Bone Burnett. \"Safe & Sound\" won the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media.[123] She wrote and produced \"Sweeter than Fiction\" with Jack Antonoff for the soundtrack to One Chance (2013).[124] Swift featured on B.o.B's \"Both of Us\" (2012)[125] and provided vocals for Tim McGraw's \"Highway Don't Care\" (2013), also featuring Keith Urban.[126] She was a voice actress in The Lorax (2012),[127] made a cameo in the sitcom New Girl (2013),[128] and had a supporting role in the dystopian film The Giver (2014).[129] From 2010 to 2013, Swift was romantically involved with the actor Jake Gyllenhaal, the political heir Conor Kennedy, and the singer Harry Styles.[83] In March 2014, Swift began living in New York City, which she credited as a creative influence on her fifth studio album, 1989.[note 1] She described 1989 as her first \"official pop album\" and produced it with Jack Antonoff, Max Martin, Shellback, Imogen Heap, Ryan Tedder, and Ali Payami.[132] Released in October 2014, the album opened atop the Billboard 200 with 1.28 million copies sold.[133] Its singles \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\" reached number one in Australia, Canada, and the US, with the first two making Swift the first woman to replace herself at the Hot 100 top spot.[134] Other singles include \"Style\", \"Wildest Dreams\", \"Out of the Woods\", and \"New Romantics\".[135] The 1989 World Tour (2015) was the highest-grossing tour of the year with $250 million in total revenue.[136] After publishing an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal stressing the importance of albums as a creative medium for artists,[137] in November 2014, Swift removed her catalog from ad-supported, free music streaming platforms such as Spotify.[138] In a June 2015 open letter, Swift criticized Apple Music for not offering royalties to artists during its free three-month trial period and threatened to withdraw her music from the platform,[139] which prompted Apple Inc. to announce that it would pay artists during the free trial period.[140] Swift then agreed to keep 1989 and her catalog on Apple Music.[141] Big Machine Records returned Swift's catalog to Spotify among other free streaming platforms in June 2017.[142] Swift was named Billboard's Woman of the Year in 2014, becoming the first artist to win the award twice.[143] At the 2014 American Music Awards, Swift received the inaugural Dick Clark Award for Excellence.[144] On her 25th birthday in 2014, the Grammy Museum at L.A. Live opened an exhibit in her honor in Los Angeles that ran until October 4, 2015.[145][146] In 2015, Swift won the Brit Award for International Female Solo Artist.[147] \"Bad Blood\" won Video of the Year and Best Collaboration at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards.[148] At the 58th Grammy Awards (2016), 1989 won Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album, making Swift the first woman to win Album of the Year twice.[149] Swift dated the DJ Calvin Harris from March 2015 to June 2016.[150] They co-wrote the song \"This Is What You Came For\", featuring vocals from Rihanna; Swift was initially credited under the pseudonym Nils Sjöberg.[151] She recorded \"I Don't Wanna Live Forever\" with Zayn Malik for the soundtrack to Fifty Shades Darker (2017)[152] and won a Country Music Association Award for Song of the Year with \"Better Man\", which she wrote for the band Little Big Town.[153] In April 2016, Kanye West released the single \"Famous\", in which he references Swift in the line, \"I made that bitch famous.\" Swift criticized West and said she never consented to the lyric, but West claimed that he had received her approval and his then-wife Kim Kardashian released video clips of Swift and West discussing the song amicably over the phone. The controversy made Swift a subject of an online \"cancel\" movement.[154] In late 2016, after briefly dating Tom Hiddleston, Swift began a six-year relationship with Joe Alwyn and retreated herself from the public spotlight.[155][156] In August 2017, Swift successfully countersued David Mueller, a former radio jockey for KYGO-FM, who sued her for damages from loss of employment. Four years earlier, she informed Mueller's bosses that he had sexually assaulted her by groping her at an event.[157] The public controversies influenced Swift's sixth studio album, Reputation, which explored the impact of her fame and musically incorporated electropop with urban styles of hip hop and R&B.[158] Released in November 2017,[159] Reputation opened atop the Billboard 200 with 1.21 million US sales[160] and topped the charts in the UK, Australia, and Canada.[161] The album's lead single, \"Look What You Made Me Do\", was Swift's first UK number-one single[162] and topped charts in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the US.[163] Its singles \"...Ready for It?\", \"End Game\", and \"Delicate\" were released to pop radio.[164] Reputation was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album.[165] Swift featured on the country duo Sugarland's \"Babe\" (2018).[166] At the 2018 American Music Awards, Swift won four awards, which made her accumulate 23 trophies in total and become the AMAs' most awarded female musician, surpassing Whitney Houston.[167] The same year, she embarked on her Reputation Stadium Tour,[168] which became the highest-grossing North American concert tour in history and grossed $345.7 million worldwide.[169] In November 2018, Swift signed a new deal with Universal Music Group, which promoted her subsequent albums under Republic Records' imprint.[170] The contract included a provision for Swift to maintain ownership of her masters. In addition, in the event that Universal sold any part of its stake in Spotify, it agreed to distribute a non-recoupable portion of the proceeds among its artists.[171][172] Swift's first album with Republic Records, Lover, was released in August 2019.[173] She produced the album with Antonoff, Louis Bell, Frank Dukes, and Joel Little.[174] Lover peaked atop the charts of such territories as Australia, Canada, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Sweden, the UK, and the US.[175] The album spawned five singles: \"Me!\", \"You Need to Calm Down\", \"Lover\", \"The Man\", and \"Cruel Summer\"; the first two singles peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, and the lattermost single became a resurgent success in 2023, reaching number one.[176] Lover was 2019's best selling album in the US and best selling album by a solo artist worldwide.[177] The album and its singles earned three nominations at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2020.[178] At the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards, Swift won three awards including Video of the Year for \"You Need to Calm Down\", becoming the first female and second artist overall to win the category for a self-directed video.[179] While promoting Lover in 2019, Swift became embroiled in a public dispute with the talent manager Scooter Braun after he purchased Big Machine Records, including the masters of her albums that the label had released.[180] Swift said she had been trying to buy the masters, but Big Machine would only allow her to do so if she exchanged one new album for each older one under a new contract, which she refused to sign.[180] In November 2020, Swift began re-recording her back catalog, which enabled her to own the new masters and the licensing of her songs for commercial use, substituting for the Big Machine-owned masters.[181] In February 2020, Swift signed a global publishing deal with Universal Music Publishing Group after her 16-year contract with Sony/ATV expired.[182] Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Swift surprise-released two \"sister albums\" that she recorded and produced with Antonoff and Aaron Dessner: Folklore in July and Evermore in December.[183] Joe Alwyn co-wrote and co-produced a few songs under the pseudonym William Bowery.[184] Both albums incorporated a muted indie folk and alternative rock production;[185] each was supported by three singles catering to US pop, country, and triple A radio formats. The singles were \"Cardigan\", \"Betty\", and \"Exile\" from Folklore, and \"Willow\", \"No Body, No Crime\", and \"Coney Island\" from Evermore.[186] Folklore was the bestselling album of 2020 in the US[187] and, together with \"Cardigan\", made Swift the first artist to debut a US number-one album and a number-one song in the same week; she achieved the feat again with Evermore and \"Willow\".[188] According to Billboard, Swift was the highest-paid musician in the US and highest-paid solo musician worldwide of 2020.[189] Folklore made Swift the first woman to win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year three times, winning the category at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards (2021).[190] At the American Music Awards, Swift won three awards including Artist of the Year for a third record time (2020)[191] and Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist and Favorite Pop/Rock Album (2021).[192] Swift played Bombalurina in the film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Cats (2019), for which she co-wrote and recorded the Golden Globe-nominated original song \"Beautiful Ghosts\".[193][194] The documentary Miss Americana, which chronicled parts of Swift's life and career, premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival.[195] Swift's re-recordings of her first six studio albums began with Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version), which were released in April and November 2021. Both peaked atop the Billboard 200, and the former was the first re-recorded album to do so.[196] Fearless (Taylor's Version) was preceded by \"Love Story (Taylor's Version)\", which made Swift the second artist after Dolly Parton to have both the original and re-recorded versions of a song reach number one on Hot Country Songs.[197] Red (Taylor's Version) was supported by \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\", which became the longest song in history to top the Hot 100.[198] Swift's tenth studio album, Midnights, was released in October 2022.[199] The album incorporates a restrained electropop[200] and synth-pop sound[201] with elements of hip hop, R&B, and electronica.[199][202] In the US, Midnights was her fifth to open atop the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of over one million copies, and its tracks, led by the single \"Anti-Hero\", made Swift the first artist to monopolize the top 10 of the Hot 100.[203] Globally, the album broke the record for the most single-day streams and most single-week streams on Spotify and peaked atop the charts of at least 14 countries.[204] The album's two further singles, \"Lavender Haze\" and \"Karma\", both peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100.[205] According to Billboard, Swift was the top-earning solo artist in the US and the top-earning musician worldwide of 2021.[206][207] She won six American Music Awards including Artist of the Year in 2022.[208] At the MTV Video Music Awards, Swift won her third and fourth trophies for Video of the Year with All Too Well: The Short Film, her self-directed short film that accompanies \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\", in 2022[209] and \"Anti-Hero\" in 2023.[210] During this period, Swift won three Grammy Awards: Best Music Video for All Too Well: The Short Film[211] and Best Pop Vocal Album and Album of the Year for Midnights. Swift became the first artist to win Album of the Year four times in Grammy history.[212] Swift's next two re-recorded albums, Speak Now (Taylor's Version) and 1989 (Taylor's Version), were released in July and October 2023. The former made Swift the woman with the most number-one albums (12) in Billboard 200 history, surpassing Barbra Streisand,[213] and the latter was her sixth album to sell one million copies in a single week in the US, claiming her career's largest album sales week.[214] 1989 (Taylor's Version)'s single \"Is It Over Now?\" peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100.[215] Swift featured on Big Red Machine's \"Renegade\" and \"Birch\" (2021),[216] Haim's \"Gasoline\" (2021),[217] Ed Sheeran's \"The Joker and the Queen\" (2022),[218] and the National's \"The Alcott\" (2023).[219] For the soundtrack of Where the Crawdads Sing (2022), she wrote and recorded \"Carolina\", which received nominations for Best Original Song at the Golden Globes and Best Song Written for Visual Media at the Grammy Awards.[220] In 2023, Swift was the most streamed artist on Spotify,[221] Apple Music,[222] and Amazon Music;[223] and the first act to place number one on the year-end Billboard top artists list in three different decades (2009, 2015 and 2023).[224] She had five out of the 10 best-selling albums of 2023 in the US, a record since Luminate began tracking US music sales in 1991.[225] Besides music, Swift had a supporting role in the period comedy film Amsterdam (2022)[226] and began writing an original script for her directorial feature film debut with Searchlight Pictures.[227] In March 2023, Swift embarked on the Eras Tour, a retrospective tour covering all her studio albums. Media outlets extensively covered the tour's global cultural and economic impact,[228] and its US leg broke the record for the most tickets sold in a day.[203] Ticketmaster received public and political criticisms for mishandling the tour's ticket sales.[229] The Eras Tour became the highest-grossing tour in history.[230][231] Its concert film, released to theaters worldwide on October 13, 2023, grossed over $250 million to become the highest-grossing concert film and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Cinematic and Box Office Achievement.[232][233] Swift's eleventh studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, was released on April 19, 2024.[234] Topping charts globally, the album broke a string of records: it marked the first album ever to amass 1 billion Spotify streams in a week; sold 2.6 million units in its first week in the US; made Swift the first artist to monopolize the top 14 of the Billboard Hot 100 and the top 10 of Australia's ARIA Singles Chart; and went on to spend 16 weeks atop the Billboard 200—Swift's longest-running number-one album on the chart. The lead single, \"Fortnight,\" featuring Post Malone, became Swift's 12th number one song on the Hot 100.[235][236][237] After the pandemic, Swift's music releases, touring, and related activities culminated in an unprecedented height of popularity.[238] From 2023 onward, Swift found ubiquitous success, albeit more dominant than before, with the successes of the re-recordings, the Eras Tour, its concert film, Midnights, and The Tortured Poets Department, significantly increasing her net worth; Music Business Worldwide remarked this as a \"new stratosphere of global career success\" for Swift.[239][240] In 2023, she began dating the American football player Travis Kelce,[241] and in 2024, won Artist of the Year at the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Awards.[242] The same year, AI-generated fake pornographic images portraying Swift were posted to Twitter and spread to other social media platforms, spurring criticism and demands for legal reform.[243] In July, Swift and Kelce received death threats from a stalker in Gelsenkirchen, Germany,[244] and three children were killed in a stabbing attack at a Swift-themed workshop in Southport, England, leading to civil unrest in the UK.[245] In August, all three of the Eras Tour concerts in Vienna were canceled following the arrest of two suspects for allegedly planning an Islamic State-inspired terrorist attack in the city. The plan was uncovered by US Intelligence and was thwarted by Austrian police forces.[246] Swift's early musical influences were 1990s female country musicians such as Shania Twain, Faith Hill, LeAnn Rimes, and the Dixie Chicks,[247] and Keith Urban's country crossover sounds incorporating rock, pop, and blues.[248] She self-identified as a country musician and achieved prominence as a country pop singer with her first four studio albums, from Taylor Swift to Red.[249] The albums feature country signifiers such as banjo, six-string banjo, mandolin, fiddle, and a slight vocal twang, in addition to pop melodies and rock influences;[250][251] Speak Now draws on rock styles such as pop rock, pop-punk, and 1980s arena rock.[95][252] Critics argued that country was an indicator of Swift's narrative songwriting rather than musical direction[253][254] and accused her of causing mainstream country music to stray from its roots.[255][256] After the critical debate around Red's eclectic pop, rock, and electronic styles, Swift chose 1980s synth-pop as a defining sound of her recalibrated pop artistry and image, inspired by the music of Phil Collins, Annie Lennox, Peter Gabriel, and Madonna.[257][258] 1989, the first album in this direction, incorporates electronic arrangements consisting of dense synthesizers and drum machines.[259] Swift expanded on the electronic production on her next albums;[260] Reputation consists of hip hop, R&B, and EDM influences;[158][261] and Lover features eclectic elements from country, pop-punk, and folk rock.[262] When Swift embraced a pop identity, rockist critics regarded her move as an erosion of her country music songwriting authenticity,[263] but others regarded it as necessary for Swift's artistic evolution and defended her as a pioneer of poptimism.[264][265] Her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore explore alternative and indie styles of rock and folk, and both incorporate a subtle, stripped-back soundscape with orchestration, synthesizers, and drum pads.[266][267] The latter experiments with varied song structures, asymmetric time signatures, and diverse instruments.[268][269] Critics deemed the indie styles a mature representation of Swift's artistry as a singer-songwriter.[267] Midnights and The Tortured Poets Department both incorporate a minimalist, subdued synth-pop sound, making use of analog synthesizers, sustained bass notes, and simple drum machine patterns.[270][271] With continuous musical reinventions,[272] Swift was described by Time and the BBC as a musical \"chameleon\".[273][274] Jody Rosen commented that by originating her career in Nashville, Swift made a \"bait-and-switch maneuver, planting roots in loamy country soil, then pivoting to pop\".[275] Clash wrote that she has the versatility to \"no longer [...] be defined by any genre or sound label\".[276] According to Ann Powers, Swift's sound is genre-agnostic, blending and \"reconfiguring\" elements of country, R&B, indie pop, and hip hop.[277][278] Swift possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range[283] and a generally soft and breathy timbre that Rolling Stone deemed versatile.[284][285] Reviews of Swift's early country albums criticized her vocals as weak and strained compared to those of other female country singers.[286] Despite the criticism, most reviewers appreciated that Swift refrained from correcting her pitch with Auto-Tune and how she prioritized \"intimacy over power and nuance\" to communicate the messages of her songs with her audience[287]—a style that has been described as conversational.[288][289] According to Powers, Swift's defining vocal feature was her attention to detail to convey an exact feeling—\"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow\".[290] On Red and 1989, Swift's vocals are electronically processed to accompany the pop production.[291][288] Her voice on Reputation and Midnights incorporates hip-hop and R&B influences that result in a near-rap delivery which emphasizes rhythm and cadence over melody.[292][277] She uses her lower register vocals extensively in \"Cardigan\"[293] and both her lower and upper registers in Evermore; the musicologist Alyssa Barca described her timbre in the upper register as \"breathy and bright\" and the lower register as \"full and dark\".[269] Reviews in The New York Times, Variety and The Atlantic were more appreciative of Swift's vocals in her later albums.[251][294][295][296] She ranked 102nd on Rolling Stone's 2023 list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time: \"A decade ago, including her on this list would have been a controversial move, but recent releases like Folklore, Evermore, and Midnights officially settled the argument.\"[285] Laura Snapes of The Guardian said that Swift's \"vocal directness\" enables her to express wide-ranging feelings, highlighting some trademarks such as \"yo-yoing vocal yelp\" and \"climactic, processed cri de coeur\".[297] Amanda Petrusich praised how the clarity and tone of Swift's live vocals accentuate her lyrics.[298] Swift's fascination with songwriting began in her childhood. She credited her mother with igniting confidence and early songwriting interests by helping her prepare for class presentations.[299][300] She enjoyed Disney film soundtracks and would make up lyrics once she had run out of words singing them.[301] Her lyrical influences include female country songwriters such as Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, and Dolly Parton;[19][104] 1990s songwriters such as Melissa Etheridge, Sarah McLachlan, and Alanis Morissette;[302] Joni Mitchell;[303] and Fall Out Boy.[304] She listed Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, and Kris Kristofferson as career role models, citing their both evolving and consistent songwriting outputs.[28][305] Her literary influences include the authors William Shakespeare, Nathaniel Hawthorne, F. Scott Fitzgerald,[306] and the poets William Wordsworth, Robert Frost, and Emily Dickinson;[307] the last of whom was a distant cousin of Swift.[308] In The New Yorker in 2011, Swift said she identifies as a songwriter first: \"I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across\".[28] Her personal experiences were a common inspiration for her early songs, which helped her navigate life.[309][310] Her \"diaristic\" technique began with identifying an emotion, followed by a corresponding melody.[311][312] On her first three studio albums, love, heartbreak, and insecurities, from an adolescent perspective, were dominant themes.[95][313] She delved into the tumult of toxic relationships on Red,[314] and embraced nostalgia and post-romance positivity on 1989.[257] Reputation was inspired by the downsides of Swift's fame,[315] and Lover detailed her realization of the \"full spectrum of love\".[316] Other themes in Swift's music include family dynamics, friendship,[317][318] alienation, self-awareness, and tackling vitriol, especially sexism.[300][319] She often references or draws inspiration from historical events and figures.[320] Swift's confessional lyrics received positive reviews from critics,[321][28][322] who highlighted their vivid details and emotional engagement, which they found uncommon in pop music,[323][324][325] although some perceived her as a fragile, juvenile artist, a label she has consistently challenged.[321] Critics also praised her melodic compositions; Rolling Stone described Swift as \"a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture\".[326][327] NPR dubbed Swift \"a master of the vernacular in her lyrics\",[158] remarking that her songs offer emotional engagement because \"the wit and clarity of her arrangements turn them from standard fare to heartfelt disclosures\".[327] Despite the positive reception, The New Yorker stated she was generally portrayed \"more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary\".[28] Tabloid media often speculated and linked the subjects of her songs with her ex-lovers, a practice reviewers and Swift herself criticized as sexist.[328][329][330] Aside from clues in album liner notes, Swift avoided talking about the subjects of her songs.[331] On her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, Swift was inspired by escapism and romanticism to explore fictional narratives.[332] She imposed emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, which liberated her from tabloid attention and suggested new paths for her artistry.[311] Swift explained that she welcomed the new songwriting direction after she stopped worrying about commercial success.[332] According to Spin, she explored complex emotions with \"precision and devastation\" on Evermore.[333] Consequence stated her 2020 albums convinced skeptics of her songwriting prowess, noting her transformation from \"teenage wunderkind to a confident and careful adult\".[334] Swift divides her writing into three types: \"quill lyrics\", songs rooted in antiquated poeticism; \"fountain pen lyrics\", based on modern and vivid storylines; and \"glitter gel pen lyrics\", which are lively and frivolous.[335] Fans noticed that the fifth track of every Swift album was the most emotionally vulnerable of the album.[336] Awarding her with the Songwriter Icon Award in 2021, the National Music Publishers' Association remarked that \"no one is more influential when it comes to writing music today\".[337] The Week deemed her the foremost female songwriter of modern times,[338] and the Nashville Songwriters Association International named her Songwriter-Artist of the Decade in 2022.[203] Swift has also published two original poems: \"Why She Disappeared\" and \"If You're Anything Like Me\".[339] Critics have analyzed the distinctive qualities and thematic depth in Swift's songwriting. Critic Kitty Empire opined in 2024 that Swift is \"a profoundly old-fashioned artist\", whose songs \"tell a story, in succinct, emotive ways that often scan meticulously\" unlike most pop music of the time; Empire attributed it to Swift's country beginnings.[340] Swift's bridges are often noted as one of the best aspects of her songs,[341][334] earning her the title \"Queen of Bridges\" from Time.[342] Mojo dubbed her \"a sharp narrator with a gift for the extended metaphor\".[343] Academics have variably described her as a poet laureate,[344] philosopher,[345] and bard.[346] Swift commands large audiences on stage,[347][348][349] captivating them through emotional storytelling and vocal delivery rather than relying on elaborate choreography.[350] According to V magazine's Greg Krelenstein, she possesses \"a rare gift of turning a stadium spectacle into an intimate setting\", irrespective of whether she is \"plucking a guitar or leading an army of dancers\".[351] In a 2008 review of Swift's early performances, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker called Swift a \"preternaturally skilled\" entertainer with a vibrant stage presence, adding \"she returned the crowd's energy with the professionalism she has shown since the age of fourteen.\"[352] In 2023, Adrian Horton of The Guardian noted her \"seemingly endless stamina\" on the Eras Tour,[353] and i critic Ilana Kaplan called her showmanship \"unparalleled\".[354] Swift's concert productions have been characterized by elaborate Broadway theatricality and high technology,[355] and her performances frequently incorporate a live band, with whom she has played and toured since 2007.[356] Swift also often accompanies herself with musical instruments such as electric guitar;[357] acoustic guitar; piano;[358] and sometimes twelve-string guitar,[359][360] six-string banjo,[361] or ukulele.[362] Interacting frequently with the audience, her solo acoustic performances are considered intimate and emotionally resonant, complementing her story-based lyrics and fan connection.[298][363] Lydia Burgham of The Spinoff opined that this intimacy remains \"integral to her singer-songwriter origins\".[364][358] Chris Willman of Variety called Swift \"pop's most approachable superstar\",[365] and the 21st century's most popular performer.[366] Swift emphasizes visuals as a key creative component of her music-making process.[367] She has collaborated with different directors to produce her music videos, and over time, she has become more involved with writing and directing. She developed the concept and treatment for \"Mean\" in 2011[368] and co-directed the music video for \"Mine\" with Roman White the year before.[369] In an interview, White said that Swift \"was keenly involved in writing the treatment, casting and wardrobe. And she stayed for both the 15-hour shooting days, even when she wasn't in the scenes.\"[370] From 2014 to 2018, Swift collaborated with director Joseph Kahn on eight music videos—four each from her albums 1989 and Reputation.

Rosen added that Swift \"falls between genres, eras, demographics, paradigms, trends\", leaving her contemporaries \"vying for second place\".[275] Critics regard Swift as a rare yet successful combination of the pop star and singer-songwriter archetypes.[454] Swift's fans are known as Swifties.[229] Billboard noted that only a few artists have achieved her level of chart success, critical acclaim, and fan support.[455] Swift's million-selling albums are considered an anomaly in the streaming-dominated industry following the end of the album era in the 2010s.[456][457] Economist Alan Krueger described Swift as an \"economic genius\".[458] Although labeled by the media in her early career as \"America's Sweetheart\" for her girl next door persona,[459][460] Swift has been called by detractors \"calculated\" and manipulative of her image, a narrative bolstered by her 2016 dispute with West.[461][462] Critics have also noted that her personal life and career have been subject to intense misogyny and \"slut-shaming\",[463][464] as well as rampant media scrutiny and tabloid speculation.[465] Swift has also been a victim of numerous house break-ins and stalkers, some of whom were armed.[466][467] Swift's private jet use has drawn scrutiny for its carbon emissions.[468][469] In 2023, a spokesperson for Swift stated that she had purchased more than double the required carbon credits to offset all tour travel and personal flights.[470][471] In December 2023, Swift's lawyers sent a cease and desist letter to American programmer Jack Sweeney over tracking her private jet, alleging stalking and safety risks; media outlets have reported that the information posted by Sweeney is a synthesis of publicly available data.[472][473] In February 2024, it was reported that Swift had sold one of her two private jets.[474] \"You have different artists dominating different sectors of the industry: Some are huge at streaming, some are big draws on the road. But we're at this moment where there's no one better than Taylor Swift, whether that's on the radio, with streaming, ticket sales or just cultural impact.\" Swift helped shape the modern country music scene,[476] having extended her success beyond the Anglosphere,[275][476] pioneered the use of the internet (Myspace) as a marketing tool,[27][47] and introduced the genre to a younger generation.[477][275] Country labels have since become interested in signing young singers who write their own music;[478] her guitar performances contributed to the \"Taylor Swift factor\": a phenomenon to which an upsurge in guitar sales to women, a previously ignored demographic, is attributed.[479][480] According to Pitchfork, Swift changed the music landscape with her genre transitions, a discography that accommodates cultural shifts,[481] and Billboard notes her ability to popularize any sound in mainstream music.[482] Lyrically, in being personal and vulnerable in her songs, music journalist Nick Catucci opined Swift helped make space for later singers like Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, and Halsey to do the same.[483] Scholars have highlighted the literary sensibility and poptimist implications of Swift.[484][485] She has been credited with legitimizing and popularizing the concept of album \"eras\".[486][487] Swift is a subject of academic study and scholarly media research.[272] Various educational institutions offer courses on Swift in literary, cultural, and sociopolitical contexts.[488][272] Swift has influenced numerous music artists, and

her the \"millennial Bruce Springsteen\",[494] and The Times named her \"the Bob Dylan of our age\".[495] Swift earned the title Woman of the Decade (2010s) from Billboard,[496] Artist of the Decade (2010s) at the American Music Awards,[497] and Global Icon at the Brit Awards for her impact.[395] Senior artists such as Madonna,[498] Stevie Nicks,[499] Jon Bon Jovi,[500] Dolly Parton,[501] and Elton John have praised her musicianship.[502] Carole King regards Swift as her \"professional granddaughter\" and thanked Swift for \"carrying the torch forward\".[503] Springsteen called her a \"tremendous\" writer,[504] while Elvis Costello compared Swift's songwriting to that of Bob Dylan,[505] and Billy Joel considered Swift the Beatles' successor.[506] Britney Spears labeled Swift \"the most iconic pop woman of our generation\".[507] Media outlets describe Swift as a savvy businesswoman;[508][509] in 2024, she topped Billboard's annual Power 100 ranking of the top music industry executives.[510] Swift is known for her traditional album rollouts, consisting of a variety of promotional activities that Rolling Stone termed as an inescapable \"multimedia bonanza\".[511][512]

critics, and journalists.[514][515][516] Swift maintains an active presence on social media and a close relationship with fans, to which many journalists attribute her success.[517][444][518] Her

Swift identifies as a pro-choice feminist,[531] and is a founding signatory of the Time's Up movement against sexual harassment.[532] Specifically, she criticized the US Supreme Court's decision to end federal abortion rights in 2022.[533] Swift also advocates for LGBT rights,[534] and has called for the passing of the Equality Act, which prohibits discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity.[535][536] She performed during WorldPride NYC 2019 at the Stonewall Inn, a gay rights monument, and has donated to the LGBT organizations Tennessee Equality Project and GLAAD.[537][538][539] A supporter of the March for Our Lives movement and gun control reform in the US,[540] Swift is a vocal critic of white supremacy, racism, and police brutality.[541][531]

Today she's the most recognizable country-- or formerly country? or pop?-- artist in North America, if not the world: her songwriting takes in half a dozen genres, and her economic impact changes cities. We will move through Swift's own catalogue, including hits, deep cuts, outtakes, re-recordings, considering songwriting as its own art, distinct from poems recited or silently read. We will learn how to study fan culture, celebrity culture, adolescence, adulthood and appropriation; how to think about white texts, Southern texts, transatlantic texts, and queer subtexts. We will learn how to think about illicit affairs, and hoaxes, champagne problems and incomplete closure. We will look at her precursors, from Dolly Parton to the Border Ballads, and at work about her (such as the documentary \"Miss Americana\"). And we will read literary works important to her and works about song and performance, with novels, memoirs and poems by (among others) Willa Cather, James Weldon Johnson, Tracey Thorn, and William Wordsworth.
