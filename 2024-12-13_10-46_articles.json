                "content": "National Football League (1950‚Äìpresent) 1989 due to the Loma Prieta earthquake: 2020 due to restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic in the San Francisco Bay Area:[6] The San Francisco 49ers (also written as the San Francisco Forty-Niners and nicknamed the Niners)[7] are a professional American football team based in the San Francisco Bay Area. The 49ers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the National Football Conference (NFC) West division. The team plays its home games at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, located 38 miles (61 km) southeast of San Francisco. The team is named after the prospectors of the California gold rush.[8] The team was founded in 1946 as a charter member of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and joined the NFL in 1949 when the leagues merged.[9][10][11] The 49ers were the first major league professional sports franchise based in San Francisco. They are the 10th oldest franchise in the NFL, and have been family owned and operated exclusively by Italian Americans (Morabito and DeBartolo families, respectively) since the team's inception.[12][13] The team began play at Kezar Stadium in San Francisco before moving to Candlestick Park in 1971 and then to Levi's Stadium in 2014. Since 1988, the 49ers have been headquartered in Santa Clara. The 49ers won five Super Bowl championships between 1981 and 1994. Four of those came in the 1980s, and were led by Hall of Famers Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, Ronnie Lott, Steve Young, Charles Haley, Fred Dean, and coaches Bill Walsh and George Seifert.[14] They have been division champions 22 times between 1970 and 2023, making them one of the most successful teams in NFL history.[15][16] The 49ers sit alone in NFL history for most playoff wins (38), having been in the league playoffs 30 times (29 times in the NFL and one time in the AAFC), and have also played in the most NFC Championship games (19), hosting 11 of them, also an NFC record. The team has set numerous notable NFL records, including most consecutive away games won (18), most points scored in a single postseason (131), most consecutive seasons leading the league in scoring (4), most consecutive games scored (420 games from 1977 to 2004),[17] most field goals in a season (44), most games won in a season (18), and most touchdowns (8) and points scored (55) in a Super Bowl.[18] According to Forbes, the 49ers are the sixth most valuable team in the NFL, valued at $6.8 billion as of August 2024.[19] In June 2023, the enterprise branch of the 49ers completed the acquisition of English soccer club Leeds United.[20] The San Francisco 49ers, an original member of the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC), were the first major league professional sports franchise based in San Francisco, and one of the first major league professional sports teams based on the Pacific Coast.[21] In 1946, the team joined the Los Angeles Dons of the AAFC and the Los Angeles Rams of the rival National Football League as the first three teams playing a \"big four\"-sport in the Western United States,[21] eventually becoming part of the NFL themselves in 1950. In 1957, the 49ers enjoyed their first sustained success as members of the NFL. After losing the opening game of the season, the 49ers won their next three against the Rams, Bears, and Packers before returning home to Kezar Stadium for a game against the Chicago Bears on October 27, 1957. The 49ers fell behind the Bears 17‚Äì7. 49ers owner Tony Morabito (1910‚Äì1957) collapsed of a heart attack and died during the game. The 49ers players learned of his death at halftime when coach Frankie Albert was handed a note with two words: \"Tony's gone\". The 49ers scored 14 unanswered points to win the game, 21‚Äì17. Dicky Moegle's late-game interception in the end zone sealed the victory. After Tony's death, 49er ownership went to Victor Morabito (1919‚Äì1964) and Tony's widow, Josephine V. Morabito (1910‚Äì1995). The 49ers' special assistant to the Morabitos, Louis G. Spadia (1921‚Äì2013) was named general manager.[22] During the decade of the 1950s, the 49ers were known for their so-called \"Million Dollar Backfield\", consisting of four future Hall of Fame members: quarterback Y. A. Tittle and running backs John Henry Johnson, Hugh McElhenny, and Joe Perry. They became the only full-house backfield inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[23] For most of the next 13 years, the 49ers hovered around .490, except for 1963 and 1964 when they went 2‚Äì12 and 4‚Äì10 respectively.[24][25] Key players for these 49ers included running back Ken Willard, quarterback John Brodie, and offensive lineman Bruce Bosley. During this time the 49ers became the first NFL team to use the shotgun formation. It was named by the man who devised the formation, San Francisco 49ers' coach Red Hickey, in 1960. The formation, where the quarterback lines up seven yards behind the center, was designed to allow the quarterback extra time to throw. The formation was used for the first time in 1960 and enabled the 49ers to beat the Baltimore Colts, who were not familiar with the formation.[26] In 1961, primarily using the shotgun, the 49ers got off to a fast 4‚Äì1 start, including two shutouts in back-to-back weeks. In their sixth game they faced the Chicago Bears, who by moving players closer to the line of scrimmage and rushing the quarterback, were able to defeat the shotgun and in fact shut out the 49ers, 31‚Äì0. Though the 49ers went only 3‚Äì5‚Äì1 the rest of the way, the shotgun eventually became a component of most team's offenses and is a formation used by football teams at all levels. In 1962, the 49ers had a frustrating season as they won only 6 games that year. They won only one game at Kezar Stadium while on the road they won five of seven games. After posting a losing record in 1963. Victor Morabito died May 10, 1964, at age 45. The 1964 season was another lost campaign. According to the 1965 49ers Yearbook, the co-owners of the team were: Mrs. Josephine V. Morabito Fox, Mrs. Jane Morabito, Mrs. O.H. Heintzelman, Lawrence J. Purcell, Mrs. William O'Grady, Albert J. Ruffo, Franklin Mieuli, Frankie Albert, Louis G. Spadia and James Ginella. The 1965 49ers rebounded nicely to finish with a 7‚Äì6‚Äì1 record.[27] They were led that year by John Brodie, who after being plagued by injuries came back to become one of the NFL's best passers by throwing for 3,112 yards and 30 touchdowns.[28] In 1966, the Morabito widows named Lou Spadia team president.[22] For the 1968 season, the 49ers hired Dick Nolan, who had been Tom Landry's defensive coordinator with the Dallas Cowboys, as their head coach.[29] Nolan's first two seasons with the 49ers had gone much the same as the previous decade, with the 49ers going 7‚Äì6‚Äì1 and 4‚Äì8‚Äì2.[30] The 49ers started out the 1970 season 7‚Äì1‚Äì1, with their only loss a one-point defeat to Atlanta. After losses to Detroit and Los Angeles, the 49ers won their next two games before the season finale against the Oakland Raiders. Going into the game, the 49ers had a half-game lead on the Rams and needed either a win or a Giants victory against the Rams in their finale to give the 49ers their first-ever divisional title.[30] In the early game, the Giants lost to the Rams 31‚Äì3, thus forcing the 49ers to win their game to clinch the division. In wet, rainy conditions in Oakland, the 49ers won against the Raiders, 38‚Äì7, giving the 49ers their first divisional title, which made them champions of the NFC West. The 49ers won their divisional playoff game 17‚Äì14 against the defending conference champion Minnesota Vikings, thus setting up a matchup against the Dallas Cowboys for the NFC Championship. In the final home game for the 49ers at Kezar Stadium, the 49ers kept up with the Cowboys before losing 17‚Äì10, which resulted in the Cowboys going to Super Bowl V. The 49ers sent five players to the Pro Bowl that season, including MVP veteran quarterback John Brodie, wide receiver Gene Washington, and linebacker Dave Wilcox. Nolan was also named NFL Coach of the Year for 1970. Following the 1970 season, the 49ers moved from Kezar Stadium to Candlestick Park. Despite being located on the outskirts of the city, Candlestick Park gave the 49ers a much more modern facility with more amenities that was easier for fans to access by highway.[31]: 166 The 49ers won their second straight divisional title in 1971 with a 9‚Äì5 record. The 49ers again won their divisional playoff game, this time against the Washington Redskins, by 24‚Äì20. This set up a rematch against the Dallas Cowboys in the NFC Championship game, this time played in Dallas. Though the defense again held the Cowboys in check, the 49ers offense was ineffective, and the eventual Super Bowl champion Cowboys beat the 49ers again, 14‚Äì3. In 1971, eight 49ers made the Pro Bowl, including defensive back Jimmy Johnson and Gene Washington, both for the second year in a row, as well as defensive end Cedric Hardman, running back Vic Washington, and offensive lineman Forrest Blue.[32] The 49ers won their third consecutive NFC West title in 1972 with five wins in their last six games, making them the only franchise to win their first three divisional titles after the 1970 AFL‚ÄìNFL merger. Their opponents in the divisional playoffs were the Dallas Cowboys, making it the third consecutive year the teams faced each other in the playoffs. Vic Washington took the opening kickoff 97 yards for a score, and the 49ers took a 21‚Äì6 lead in the second quarter. After the 49ers took a 28‚Äì13 lead in the fourth quarter, Tom Landry sent quarterback Roger Staubach, who was backing up Craig Morton, into the game. Staubach quickly led the Cowboys on a drive to a field goal, bringing the score to within 28‚Äì16, and as the game wound down it appeared that this would be the last points the Cowboys would get. However, Dallas completed the comeback in the last two minutes. Just after the two-minute warning, Staubach took just four plays to drive 55 yards in only 32 seconds, hitting Billy Parks on a twenty-yard touchdown pass to bring the score to 28‚Äì23. Cowboys kicker Toni Fritsch then executed a successful onside kick that was recovered by Mel Renfro, giving the Cowboys the ball at midfield with 1:20 left on the clock. With the 49ers on the ropes, Staubach scrambled for 21 yards, then completed a 19-yard sideline pass to Billy Parks who went out of bounds at the 10-yard line to stop the clock. Staubach then completed the comeback with a 10-yard touchdown pass to Ron Sellers with only 52 seconds left, giving the Cowboys a dramatic 30‚Äì28 victory; it was the third straight season the Cowboys had defeated the 49ers in the postseason. It would also be their last postseason appearance for nine years. The 49ers run at the top of the NFC West ended in 1973 with the 49ers falling to a 5‚Äì9 record, their worst since 1969. The team lost six of its last eight games, including games to the also-ran New Orleans Saints and Detroit Lions. In the final season of his career, longtime 49ers quarterback John Brodie split playing time with two other quarterbacks, most notably longtime backup Steve Spurrier. The team also suffered from not having a dominant running back, with Vic Washington leading the team with only 534 yards rushing. In 1974, the 49ers drafted Wilbur Jackson from the University of Alabama to be the team's primary back. Jackson enjoyed a fine rookie year, leading the 49ers with 705 yards rushing. He and fellow running back Larry Schreiber combined for over 1,300 yards rushing. With Steve Spurrier injured and missing nearly the entire year, the 49ers did not have a regular quarterback but did put together a respectable 6‚Äì8 record. Following the season, longtime tight end Ted Kwalick left the 49ers to join the World Football League, then the Oakland Raiders upon the WFL's dissolution.[30] The 49ers dropped to 5‚Äì9 in what would be Dick Nolan's final season as coach in 1975, losing their final four games of the season. Wilbur Jackson was hurt much of the year and Delvin Williams led the 49ers in rushing with 631 yards rushing. Following the 1975 season the 49ers traded for New England Patriots quarterback Jim Plunkett, former Heisman Trophy winner from nearby Stanford University (which was also the alma mater of John Brodie). Though Plunkett had shown promise with the Patriots, he had not won there, and it was thought that he needed a change of scenery. Monte Clark was also brought on as 49ers head coach.[30] The 49ers featured one of the best running games in the NFL in 1976. Delvin Williams emerged as an elite back, gaining over 1,200 yards rushing and made the Pro Bowl. Wilbur Jackson also enjoyed a resurgence, rushing for 792 yards. Once again Gene Washington was the team's leading receiver with 457 yards receiving and six scores. The 49ers started the season 6‚Äì1 for their best start since 1970. Most of the wins were against second-tier teams, although the 49ers did shut out the Rams 16‚Äì0, in Los Angeles on Monday Night Football. In that game the 49ers recorded 10 sacks, including 6 by Tommy Hart. However, the 49ers lost four games in a row, including two against divisional rivals Los Angeles and Atlanta that proved fatal to their playoff hopes. Lou Spadia retired from the 49ers in 1977 upon the team's sale to the DeBartolo Family. The team was sold to Edward J. DeBartolo Jr. in March 1977, and despite finishing the season with a winning record of 8‚Äì6, Clark was fired after just one season by newly hired general manager Joe Thomas, who oversaw the worst stretch of football in the team's history.[30] Under coach Ken Meyer the 49ers lost their first five games of the 1977 season, including being shut out twice.[33] Though they won five of their next six, they lost their last three games to finish the season 5‚Äì9. Playing in San Francisco did not revive Plunkett's career as he had another disappointing season, throwing only 9 touchdown passes. Bright spots for the 49ers included defensive linemen Tommy Hart and Cleveland Elam, who made the Pro Bowl, and running backs Wilbur Jackson and Delvin Williams, who combined for over 1,600 yards rushing. Gene Washington again led the team in receiving in 1977, his final year with the 49ers.[34] The 1977 offseason was marked by a number of questionable moves by Joe Thomas that backfired badly. Thomas's big offseason acquisition was running back O. J. Simpson from the Buffalo Bills. As with Plunkett two years previously, it was thought that rescuing Simpson from a bad situation and bringing him to the west coast where he had been raised would rejuvenate his career. To create playing time for Simpson, Thomas traded Delvin Williams to the Miami Dolphins for wide receiver Freddie Solomon. Thomas also released Jim Plunkett, giving up on him after two seasons. Finally, Thomas fired Meyer after only one season, and replaced him with Pete McCulley, his third coach in three seasons.[35] The 1978 season was a disaster for the 49ers, as they finished 2‚Äì14, their only wins coming against the Cincinnati Bengals and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Simpson indeed led the team in rushing, but with less than 600 yards.[36] It became apparent that Simpson's knees and body were worn out, and he was near the end of his career. Wilbur Jackson also missed the entire season due to injury. Even worse for the franchise was that their first pick of the 1979 draft was traded to the Bills as part of the O. J. Simpson deal. Joe Thomas was fired following the season. Some of the key players that became part of the 49ers stunning rise began their 49ers career in 1978. Rookie quarterback Steve DeBerg, Joe Montana's first mentor, was the 49ers' starting quarterback. Running back Paul Hofer and center/guard Randy Cross also started with the 49ers in 1978. The team was led in its turnaround from late 1970s doormat by new owner Edward J. DeBartolo Jr. and head coach Bill Walsh. The former head coach of Stanford University was known for stockpiling draft picks, making excellent draft selections, and patching roster holes by acquiring key free agents. Bill Walsh was hired to be the 49ers head coach in the 1978 off-season.[37] Walsh was a disciple of Paul Brown, and served as Brown's offensive coordinator with the Cincinnati Bengals from 1968 to 1975. However, Brown did not appoint him as his successor upon his retirement, choosing another assistant, former 49ers center Bill \"Tiger\" Johnson. Walsh was hired by Stanford University in 1977. He went 17‚Äì7 in two seasons for the Cardinal before being hired by the 49ers in 1979.[38] Walsh is given credit for popularizing the 'West Coast offense'. The Bill Walsh offense was actually created and refined while he was an assistant coach with the Bengals. The offense utilizes a short, precise, timed passing game as a replacement/augmentation of the running game. The offense is extremely difficult to defend against as it is content to consistently make 6‚Äì8-yard gains all the way down the field. (The other West Coast offense‚Äîmore focused on the vertical, or downfield, passing game‚Äîwas actually created by 1960s L.A. / San Diego coach Sid Gillman, and San Diego State coach Don Coryell, who also employed a version of it as head coach of the St. Louis (football) Cardinals and San Diego Chargers during a period where it garnered the nickname \"Air Coryell\".)[39] In Walsh's first draft, the 49ers had targeted Notre Dame quarterback Joe Montana as an early-round pick. Montana had enjoyed a storied college career, leading the Fighting Irish to the 1977 national title and a number of dramatic comeback victories, the most stunning of all being his final game, at the 1979 Cotton Bowl Classic. Playing the University of Houston in an ice storm, and with Montana suffering from a bad flu, Notre Dame was down 34‚Äì10 in the third quarter. However, Montana led a magnificent rally that culminated with him throwing a touchdown pass on the game's final play to give Notre Dame the 35‚Äì34 win. Despite this, most scouts did not peg Montana as a top prospect. Although 6'2\" and 190‚Äì200 lbs., Montana's arm strength was considered suspect as was the consistency of his play. Although he did get his share of the credit, most thought of him as a system player surrounded by a great team. In the 1979 draft, the Dallas Cowboys were placed just ahead of the 49ers. The Cowboys' draft strategy through that time was to take the highest-ranked player on their draft board at the time of their selection, regardless of position. When the Cowboys' turn came up in the third round, the highest-rated player on their board was Montana. However, feeling that the quarterback position was in excellent long-term shape with Roger Staubach and Danny White, and desperately needing a tight end, the Cowboys went off their strategy and drafted Doug Cosbie. The 49ers took Montana. The 49ers' other notable draft choice of the 1979 draft was wide receiver Dwight Clark in the 10th round. Walsh discovered the unheralded Clark while scouting quarterback Steve Fuller of Clemson University as Clark ran routes for Fuller during Walsh's evaluation of the quarterback. Walsh's serendipitous discovery of Clark proved to be an early glimpse into his philosophy for picking talent.[40] As Walsh implemented his strategies and game plan, the 49ers had another year of losing, finishing 2‚Äì14 like the previous season. There were, however, a number of bright spots. Despite throwing more interceptions (21) than touchdowns (17), Steve DeBerg blossomed under Walsh, throwing for over 3,600 yards and completing 60% of his passes. Freddie Solomon also had a good year, with over 800 yards receiving. The running game was patchwork, with Paul Hofer leading the team with 615 yards and O. J. Simpson, in his final season, rushing for only 460 yards and being sidelined with injuries. The 49ers got off to a strong start in 1980, winning their first three games of the season. However, the team, still maturing, lost their next eight games in a row. Many of those games though were close, and the 49ers acquitted themselves well. During the season Walsh alternated DeBerg and Montana at quarterback. Though DeBerg had played well for the 49ers, Walsh felt the team's best chance to win in the long run was with Montana. He alternated the two quarterbacks, giving Montana some experience while keeping opponents off guard. This strategy of alternating quarterbacks from game to game and during games is rare in football, although it had been employed by other successful teams in the past, specifically the Dallas Cowboys of the early 1970s who alternated Roger Staubach and Craig Morton, and the Los Angeles Rams of the late 1940s alternating Norm Van Brocklin and Bob Waterfield. In all DeBerg started nine games, going 4‚Äì5 with 1,998 yards, 12 touchdowns and 17 interceptions. Montana started seven games, going 2‚Äì5 with 1,795 yards, 15 touchdowns, and nine picks; Montana also had a better completion percentage at 64.5 to DeBerg's 57.9.[41] The highlight of the 1980 season, and a sign of good things to come, came in Week 14. The 49ers trailed the New Orleans Saints, who at the time were winless at 0‚Äì13, 35‚Äì7 at halftime. However, led by Joe Montana, the 49ers made (what was then) possibly the greatest comeback in NFL history, coming back to tie the score in regulation and winning the game in overtime with a field goal by Ray Wersching to give the 49ers an incredible 38‚Äì35 victory. It was this game, which marked Montana's first big NFL comeback win, that won Montana the quarterback job full-time. A number of key players emerged for the 49ers in 1980. Among them were Dwight Clark, who led the 49ers with 82 receptions and just under 1,000 yards receiving, and running back Earl Cooper, who ran for over 700 yards. With the offense playing well consistently, Walsh and the 49ers focused on overhauling the defense in 1981. Walsh took the highly unusual step of overhauling his entire secondary with rookies and untested players, bringing on board Ronnie Lott, Eric Wright and Carlton Williamson and giving Dwight Hicks a prominent role. He also acquired veteran linebacker Jack \"Hacksaw\" Reynolds and veteran defensive end and sack specialist Fred Dean. These additions, when added to existing defensive mainstays like Keena Turner, turned the 49ers into an offensively and defensively balanced, dominant team. After a 1‚Äì2 start, the 49ers won all but one of their remaining games to finish with a 13‚Äì3 record; at this time, it was the team's best regular-season win‚Äìloss record. Dean made the Pro Bowl, as did Lott and Hicks. Led by Montana, the unusual offense was centered on the short passing game, which Walsh used as ball control. Dwight Clark and Freddie Solomon had excellent years receiving; Clark as the possession receiver, and Solomon as more of a deep threat. The 49ers' running game, however, was among the weakest in the league. Ricky Patton led the 49ers with only 543 yards rushing. The 49ers' most valuable running back, however, might have been Earl Cooper, whose strength was as a pass catching back. The 49ers faced the New York Giants in the divisional playoffs and won, 38‚Äì24. This set up an NFC championship game match-up with the Dallas Cowboys, whom the 49ers historically could not beat during their playoff runs in the early 1970s. The 49ers played the Cowboys tough, but the Cowboys forced six turnovers and held the lead late. The 49ers were down 27‚Äì21 and on their own 11-yard line with 4:54 remaining. As Montana had done for Notre Dame and the 49ers so many times, he led the 49ers on a sustained final 89-yard drive to the Cowboys' 6-yard line. On a 3rd-and-3 play, with his primary receiver covered, Montana rolled right and threw the ball off balance to Dwight Clark, who leaped in the end zone and caught the ball to tie the game at 27 (\"The Catch\"), with the extra point giving the 49ers the lead. The Cowboys had one last chance to win. On the first play of the next possession, Cowboys receiver Drew Pearson caught a pass from Danny White and reached midfield before he was pulled down by the jersey at the 49ers' 44-yard line by cornerback Eric Wright, who prevented a winning touchdown. On the next play, White was sacked by Lawrence Pillers and fumbled the ball, which was recovered by Jim Stuckey, giving the 49ers the win and a trip to their first-ever Super Bowl, against the Cincinnati Bengals, who were also in their first Super Bowl. In Super Bowl XVI The 49ers took a 20‚Äì0 halftime lead and held on to win 26‚Äì21 behind kicker Ray Wersching's four field goals and a key defensive stand. In the '81 season, the defense had been a significant reason for the team's success, despite hiding in the shadow of the then-innovative offense. Montana won MVP honors mostly on the strength of leading the 49ers on a 92-yard, 12-play drive culminating in a touchdown pass to Earl Cooper. The 49ers completed one of the most dramatic and complete turnarounds in NFL history, going from a 2‚Äì14 season and a 6‚Äì10 season to a Super Bowl championship.[42] The 1982 season was a retrogression; the team lost all five games at Candlestick Park en route to a 3‚Äì6 record in a strike-shortened season.[43] This year was the 49ers' last losing season for the next 17 years. Joe Montana was the one highlight, passing for 2,613 yards in just nine games, highlighted by five straight games in which he broke the 300-yard barrier.[44] In 1983, the 49ers won their final three games and finished 10‚Äì6, winning their second NFC Western Divisional Title in three years.[45] Leading the rebound was Joe Montana with another stellar season; he passed for 3,910 yards and 26 touchdowns. In the NFC Divisional Playoffs, the 49ers hosted the Detroit Lions. The 49ers jumped in front early and led 17‚Äì9 entering the 4th quarter, but the Lions roared back, scoring two touchdowns to take a 23‚Äì17 lead. However, Montana led a comeback, hitting wide receiver Freddie Solomon on a game-winning 14-yard touchdown pass with 2:00 on the clock and putting the 49ers ahead 24‚Äì23. The game ended when Lions placekicker Eddie Murray missed a game-winning FG attempt. The next week, the 49ers came back from a 21‚Äì0 deficit against the Washington Redskins in the NFC championship game to tie the game, before controversial penalties and a late Mark Moseley field goal sent the Redskins to a 24‚Äì21 victory and Super Bowl XVIII.[46] In 1984, the 49ers had one of the greatest seasons in team history by finishing the regular season 15‚Äì1, setting the record for most regular-season wins that was later equaled by the 1985 Chicago Bears, the 1998 Minnesota Vikings, the 2004 Pittsburgh Steelers, the 2011 Green Bay Packers and finally broken by the 2007 New England Patriots (with 16 regular-season victories). Their 18 wins overall is also still a record, tied by the 1985 Bears and the 2007 New England Patriots (who won 18 straight, but lost Super Bowl XLII to the New York Giants). The 49ers' only defeat in the 1984 season was a 20‚Äì17 loss to the Steelers; a late field goal attempt in that game by San Francisco kicker Ray Wersching went off the uprights and was no good. In the playoffs, they beat the New York Giants 21‚Äì10, shut out the Chicago Bears 23‚Äì0 in the NFC championship, and in Super Bowl XIX the 49ers shut down a record-setting year by NFL MVP Dan Marino (and his speedy receivers Mark Clayton and Mark Duper), beating the Miami Dolphins 38‚Äì16. Their entire defensive backfield (Ronnie Lott, Eric Wright, Dwight Hicks, and Carlton Williamson) was elected to the Pro Bowl‚Äîan NFL first. In the 1985 NFL draft, the team received the 28th overall pick after winning the Super Bowl the previous year. On draft day, the 49ers traded its first two picks for New England's first-round choice, the 16th selection overall (the teams also swapped third-round picks as part of the deal), and selected Jerry Rice from Mississippi Valley State. It was reported that the Dallas Cowboys, who had the 17th selection overall, were intending to pick him. In the 1985 season, the 49ers were not as dominant as in 1984, finishing the regular season with a 10‚Äì6 record and a wild card berth. Jerry Rice struggled at times (dropping numerous passes), but he still impressed the NFL in his rookie season for the 49ers in 1985, especially after a 10-catch, 241-yard game against the Los Angeles Rams in December. Rice was named NFC Offensive Rookie of the Year after recording 49 catches for 927 yards, and averaging 19.9 yards per catch, Roger Craig became the first NFL player to gain 1,000 yards rushing and 1,000 yards receiving in the same season. In the 1985 playoffs, the 49ers were quickly eliminated from the playoffs by the New York Giants 17‚Äì3.[47] In the 1986 NFL season, the 49ers got off to a quick start after a 31‚Äì7 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on opening day. But the win was costly; Joe Montana injured his back and was out for two months, the injury was to a spinal disc in Montana's lower back and required immediate surgery. The injury was so severe that Montana's doctors suggested that Montana retire. On September 15, 1986, the 49ers placed Montana on the injured reserve list, Jeff Kemp became the starting quarterback, and the 49ers went 4‚Äì3‚Äì1 in September and October. Montana returned to the team on November 6 of that year. In his first game back from injury, Montana passed for 270 yards and three touchdown passes in a 43‚Äì17 49er victory against the St. Louis Cardinals. The 49ers caught fire, winning the next 5 of the final 7 games, including a 24‚Äì14 win over the Los Angeles Rams, to clinch the NFC West title. Jerry Rice continued to show improvement from the previous season catching 86 passes for a league-leading 1,570 yards and 15 touchdowns. Montana was co-recipient of the 1986 NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award, which he shared with Vikings quarterback Tommy Kramer. However, the New York Giants would defeat the 49ers again in the playoffs, 49‚Äì3 in the team's worst post-season loss to date. Montana was again injured in the first half by a hit from the Giants' Jim Burt.[48] In the off-season, Bill Walsh was concerned about Montana's health going forward, and with no reliable back-up at quarterback he completed a trade for Steve Young, then a quarterback with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. During the strike-shortened 1987 season, the 49ers became one of the NFL's elite teams once again with a league-best 13‚Äì2 record. Joe Montana had a bounce-back year after his injuries the previous year and being questioned by the media if he could still produce at a high level, by throwing 31 touchdown passes, a career-high. He also set the NFL record for most consecutive pass attempts without an incomplete pass (22), passed for 3,054 yards, and had a passer rating of 102.1. Rice had established himself as an elite receiver, he caught 65 passes for 1,078 yards and a then NFL-record 22 touchdowns in just 12 games. 1987 was the second of six seasons in which Rice would lead the NFL in receiving or touchdown receptions, he was named Offensive Player of the Year. By the end of the regular season the 49ers were ranked No. 1 on both offense and defense and were heavy favorites to win the Super Bowl. However, they were stunned in the NFC divisional round, losing 36‚Äì24 to what was believed to be an inferior Minnesota Vikings team, their third straight playoff loss. Joe Montana had one of the worst post-season games of his career and was eventually benched during the game in favor of Steve Young, who scored a rushing touchdown and threw another. After the game, owner Eddie DeBartolo stripped Walsh of the team president title. Dwight Clark retired that off-season.[49] During the off-season, a quarterback controversy between Joe Montana and Steve Young had begun after Montana's poor performance in the playoffs the previous year. Many speculated that the 1988 season would be his last year with the team. In the 1988 NFL season, the 49ers struggled to start the season; Walsh would constantly switch QBs between Montana (who suffered an elbow injury week 1 that would linger for most of the season) and Young. At one point, they were 6‚Äì5 and the team was in danger of missing the playoffs. Before week 11, Ronnie Lott called a players-only meeting; after the meeting, the team came together and defeated the defending Super Bowl champion Washington Redskins in a Monday night game, Montana had fully recovered from his injury and retook the starting quarterback job as the team eventually finished the season at 10‚Äì6.[50] They gained a measure of revenge by routing the Minnesota Vikings 34‚Äì9 in the divisional playoffs.[51] The 49ers then traveled to Chicago's Soldier Field for the NFC championship against the Chicago Bears, where the wind chill factor at game time was ‚àí26¬∞.[52] However, despite the weather, Joe Montana picked apart the Bears' top-rated defense by scoring three touchdowns as the 49ers dominated the Bears with a 28‚Äì3 victory, earning the team's third trip to the Super Bowl, to go against the Cincinnati Bengals.[53] In Super Bowl XXIII, despite numerous trips deep into Cincinnati territory by the 49ers, the game was tied 3‚Äì3 at halftime. Early in the fourth quarter, Montana tied the score at 13; however, Cincinnati regained the lead on a Jim Breech field goal to put the Bengals ahead 16‚Äì13 with just over three minutes left on the clock. Following the kickoff, and a holding penalty, the 49ers took over on their 8-yard line with 3:08 left on the clock. Joe Montana began the final drive by stepping into the huddle and remarking to offensive tackle Harris Barton, during a television timeout, \"hey, there's John Candy\", as he pointed to the stands on the other side of the field.[54] His calm demeanor reassured the 49ers, and he then engineered what some consider the greatest drive in Super Bowl history, as he drove the team 92 yards for the winning touchdown on a pass to John Taylor with only 34 seconds left, as they captured their third Super Bowl championship with a score of 20‚Äì16.[55] Jerry Rice was named Super Bowl MVP.[54] After Super Bowl XXIII, Bill Walsh retired as head coach; his defensive coordinator and handpicked successor, George Seifert, took over as head coach.[56] In the 1989 NFL season, Joe Montana threw for 3,521 yards and 26 touchdowns, with only 8 interceptions, giving him a 112.4 quarterback rating, which was then the highest single-season passer rating in NFL history, and was named NFL Most Valuable Player.[57][58][59] Jerry Rice, in his fifth year in the league, continued to dominate; he led the league with almost 1,490 receiving yards, and 17 touchdowns.[60] The 49ers clinched their fourth straight division title, beating the Los Angeles Rams 30‚Äì27 after a dramatic second-half comeback; they finished 14‚Äì2, gaining home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. Their two losses were by a combined five points.[61] In the divisional playoffs, they easily defeated the Vikings, 41‚Äì13. In the NFC championship game, they played against the Rams for a third time; the previous two games had been decided by a total of 4 points, but they were able to blow out the Rams 30‚Äì3, earning another trip to the Super Bowl, where they defeated the Denver Broncos in relatively easy fashion by a score of 55‚Äì10 in Super Bowl XXIV ‚Äì setting a record for points scored and widest margin of victory in a Super Bowl.[62][63][64] Montana himself set many Super Bowl records (some since tied or surpassed) en route to his third Super Bowl MVP. In winning the Super Bowl, the 49ers became the only team to win back-to-back Super Bowls under different head coaches. This 1989 championship team is often regarded as one of the most dominant teams in NFL history, winning three playoff games by a combined 100 points.[65] In 1990, the 49ers won their first 10 games, and they eventually finished 14‚Äì2.[66] They ripped through the season, and the coveted third consecutive Super Bowl victory seemed within reach. In the playoffs, the 49ers dispatched the Washington Redskins 28‚Äì10,[67] setting up a conference championship game with the New York Giants. Despite not scoring a touchdown in the game, the Giants took advantage of a fourth-quarter injury to Montana and converted a faked punt attempt to thwart the 49ers' attempt at a \"three-peat\". The Giants kicked a last-second field goal after recovering a Roger Craig fumble in the final minutes of the game, winning 15‚Äì13 and going on to win Super Bowl XXV.[68] During their quest for a \"three-peat\" between 1988 and 1990, the 49ers set a league record with 18 consecutive road victories.[69] Joe Montana missed almost all of the following two seasons with a recurring elbow injury. Following the 1990 season, the 49ers left team stalwarts Roger Craig and Ronnie Lott unprotected and let them go to the Los Angeles Raiders via Plan B free agency.[70] In 1991, Steve Young injured the thumb on his throwing hand and later was sidelined with an injured knee. After 10 games, the 49ers had a record of 4‚Äì6. Backup quarterback Steve Bono helped the team win its next five games with Young sidelined. In the final game of the season, Monday night versus the NFC's number two seed, Young returned and the 49ers beat the Chicago Bears 52‚Äì14, finishing 10‚Äì6.[71] However, the team missed qualifying for the playoffs by virtue of losing the head-to-head tiebreaker to the Atlanta Falcons, which had beaten the 49ers on a last-second Hail Mary pass earlier in the season.[72] In 1992, Joe Montana came back after missing almost two full seasons due to an elbow injury in his throwing arm and started the second half of a Monday night game versus Detroit on December 28, 1992. With the 49ers clinging to a 7‚Äì6 lead, Montana entered the game and looked as though he had not missed a single snap, completing 15‚Äì21 for 126 yards and 2 touchdowns, as the 49ers defeated the Lions 24‚Äì6. The 49ers finished the 1992 season with a 14‚Äì2 record and home-field advantage in the playoffs. San Francisco defeated the Washington Redskins 20‚Äì13 in the divisional playoff game but lost to the Dallas Cowboys 30‚Äì20 in the NFC championship at Candlestick Park.[73][74] At the end of the 1992 season, partly fueled by media hype, the biggest quarterback controversy in football history was in full swing. After discussions with the owner and the coach, Montana asked for, and was granted, a trade to the Kansas City Chiefs prior to the 1993 season.[75] Despite Eddie DeBartolo wanting Montana to stay and start, Montana realized that he and Young could not stay with the 49ers without a controversy. Montana was later quoted as saying, \"If I had stayed and started, there would have been problems. If I had stayed and Steve Young had started, there would have been problems.\" The 49ers finished the 1993 season, the team's first without Joe Montana on the roster, with a 10‚Äì6 record and no. 2 seed in the playoffs.[76][77] San Francisco defeated the New York Giants 44‚Äì3 in the divisional playoff game but lost to the Dallas Cowboys 38‚Äì21 in the NFC championship at Texas Stadium.[78][79] In 1994, the team spent large amounts of money on the addition of several star free agents from other teams, including Ken Norton Jr., Gary Plummer, Rickey Jackson, Bart Oates, Richard Dent, Charles Mann and Deion Sanders.[80] Additionally, several rookie players made key contributions to the team, some becoming season-long starters such as defensive tackle Bryant Young, fullback William Floyd, and linebacker Lee Woodall. Due to injuries to the offensive line, the 49ers had some tough times early in the season, including a 40‚Äì8 home loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, and a 24‚Äì17 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, led by former 49ers quarterback Joe Montana. Following the Eagles game, a poll conducted on local sports radio station KNBR showed that an overwhelming majority of 49er fans wanted head coach George Seifert fired. The game against the Eagles was a turning point for the 49ers despite the lopsided score. Quarterback Steve Young was benched in the 3rd quarter and was later seen on the sidelines, shouting profanities at Seifert. The following week in Detroit, the 49ers trailed the Lions 7‚Äì0. After throwing a pass, Young was hit, picked up, and driven into the ground by three Lions defenders. He crawled most of the way off of the field before refusing help from the trainers as he limped the remaining way off the field. He returned to the field two plays later (NFL rules state that after trainers attend to an injured player, that player must leave the field for at least one play) to lead the 49ers to a 27‚Äì21 victory. The team rallied around Young to win 10 straight games, including a 21‚Äì14 victory over the two-time defending Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys. During that span the 49ers' average margin of victory was nearly 20 points per game, a sustained dominance not seen since the 1985 Chicago Bears. Despite scoring only 8 points in one game and 14 in another, the 49ers set a new record for total regular-season and post-season combined points scored. That record was later broken by the New England Patriots in 2007 (the 1998 Minnesota Vikings scored 556 regular-season points, but only 68 postseason points, for a total of 624 points, while the 1994 49ers scored 495 regular-season points and 131 postseason points for a total of 626, the second-highest mark in NFL history). Even after those initial rough spots early in the season, the 49ers finished the season 13‚Äì3 and with home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.[81] In their first game, they easily defeated the Chicago Bears, 44‚Äì15, setting up the third straight 49ers‚ÄìCowboys NFC championship game.[82] The 49ers took advantage of three early Cowboys turnovers, taking a 21‚Äì0 lead in the first quarter. Taking a 31‚Äì14 lead into halftime after a perfect 29-yard pass from Young to Rice in the closing seconds, the game appeared to be far out of reach for the Cowboys. But a 49er fumble on the opening kick of the 3rd quarter led to a Cowboy score, cutting the lead to 31‚Äì21. Later, the 49ers responded with a Young touchdown run, making it 38‚Äì21, before the Cowboys scored another touchdown in the final minutes for a final score of 38‚Äì28.[83] The convincing win qualified the 49ers for their fifth Super Bowl appearance, and the first to be played by two teams from California. The 49ers steamrolled the San Diego Chargers 49‚Äì26 behind Young's record-setting 6 touchdown passes in Super Bowl XXIX, at the time becoming the first team to win a record five Super Bowls.[84] Finally establishing himself as a worthy successor to Joe Montana, Young was named the game's MVP.[85] The 49ers' run of five Super Bowl wins in 14 seasons (1981‚Äì1994) solidified them alongside the 1960s Vince Lombardi Green Bay Packers and 1970s Chuck Knoll Pittsburgh Steelers as one of the modern NFL's great dynasties.[86] The 49ers finished with a 11‚Äì5 record, won the division, and made the playoffs in 1995.[87] The team finished with a 12‚Äì4 record and made the postseason in 1996.[88] In both 1995 and 1996, they were eliminated by the Green Bay Packers both times in the Divisional Round.[89][90] On January 17, 1997, George Seifert resigned as 49ers head coach.[91] On the same day as Seifert's resignation, the 49ers hired Cal head coach Steve Mariucci as his replacement. At the time, Mariucci only had one year of head-coaching experience at any level.[92] The first game of the 1997 season against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers was a disaster, as both quarterback Steve Young and receiver Jerry Rice went down with injuries. Rice appeared to be out for the season with a serious knee injury, while Young left the game with one of the many concussions he suffered throughout his career. However, the team overcame adversity: Young returned two weeks later, and with the league's number one defense, the 49ers finished the season with a 13‚Äì3 record which included an 11-game winning streak which was the longest by a rookie head coach at the time, and the 49ers became the quickest team in NFL history to clinch their division at the time.[93] Rice returned for one and a half quarters in week 16 against the Denver Broncos, before getting another injury to his knee (unrelated to the first one). In the playoffs the 49ers defeated the Minnesota Vikings 38‚Äì22,[94] advancing to the NFC championship game for the first time since 1994, where they again met the Green Bay Packers at Candlestick Park, but lost 23‚Äì10.[95] During that season Eddie DeBartolo Jr. was involved in a corruption investigation regarding Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards and one of his Mississippi riverboat casinos. DeBartolo later pleaded guilty to a failure to report a felony charge in 1998. He was suspended from active control of the 49ers for one year.[96] His sister, Denise, and her husband, Dr. John York, took over operations of the team.[97] In 1998, Jerry Rice finally returned from his knee injury week 1 against the New York Jets, a game best remembered for running back Garrison Hearst's 96-yard touchdown run in overtime to win the game.[98] The 49ers had the 2nd most productive offense in league history. Young, who was questioned if his concussion history would put an end to his career, had his best season, throwing for 4,170 yards, 36 touchdowns and only 12 interceptions. A healthy Jerry Rice, 3rd-year player Terrell Owens, and 4th-year player J.J. Stokes became the first WR-trio in team history to catch at least 60 passes in the same season, Hearst ran for 1,570 yards and 7 touchdowns while averaging 5.1 yards per carry. The 49ers finished 12‚Äì4, their 16th straight winning season (all with 10 wins or more), earning a wildcard berth.[99] Once again, the 49ers faced the Green Bay Packers in the playoffs. Things looked bleak when the 49ers trailed 27‚Äì23 in the waning seconds. However, in the game's final moment, Young hit Terrell Owens (who was having a terrible game up to that point) on a dramatic, game-winning 25-yard touchdown pass, dubbed by many as \"The Catch II\".[100] That put the 49ers ahead 30‚Äì27 with just three seconds left on the game clock, sealing the win.[101] After finally beating the Packers, the 49ers went on to lose to the eventual NFC champion Atlanta Falcons in the Divisional round 20‚Äì18, in a game that was marked by Hearst suffering a gruesome broken ankle on the first play from scrimmage.[102] DeBartolo returned from his suspension in 1999, but a series of lawsuits over control of the family's vast holdings led him to surrender controlling interest to the Yorks as part of a 2000 settlement. Denise York became chair of the board, while John York became CEO. On the field, the 1999 49ers got off to a 3‚Äì1 start, then in a nationally televised Monday Night Football game against the Arizona Cardinals, Steve Young suffered a blindside hit from cornerback Aeneas Williams that knocked him out of the game and eventually convinced him to retire.[103] At the time it was believed the severe hit ended his career but Young later said in interviews he could have come back to play another season or two. After meeting with then-general manager Bill Walsh and being told about how the salary cap troubles would make the team non-competitive, Young chose to retire rather than risk his long-term health further for a likely losing club. Without their future Hall of Famer, 29-year-old rookie Jeff Garcia took over as starting quarterback, but he would be benched for poor performances in favor of Steve Stenstrom.[104] Garcia would be reinstated as the starting quarterback and in the final 5 games of the regular season. The 49ers lost 11 of their last 12 games and suffered their first losing season in a non-strike year since 1980, which was also the last time that the 49ers did not win at least ten or more games in a season.[105] Bobb McKittrick, 49ers offensive line coach since 1979, also died of cancer following the 1999 season.[106] Before the 2000 season Jeff Garcia was named the starting quarterback despite the 49ers drafting two quarterbacks (Giovanni Carmazzi in the third round and Tim Rattay in the seventh).[107] Garcia kept the starting job throughout the season and showed drastic improvement from the previous year. He broke a franchise record for most passing yards in one season, with 4,278 passing yards and 31 touchdowns and only 10 interceptions.[108] Garcia and Terrell Owens, who established himself as the team's number-one receiver, both earned their first Pro Bowl selections.[109] However, the 49ers finished 6‚Äì10, missing the playoffs for the second straight season for the first time since 1979 and 1980, due to a defense that gave up 26.4 points per game and a total of 422 points.[110] The 2000 season was Jerry Rice's final year with the 49ers; he played 16 seasons with the team.[111] In the 2001 season the 49ers established themselves as a playoff team once again after two down years. They finished with a 12‚Äì4 record and a wildcard berth. A quarter of their wins came in 4th-quarter comebacks.[112] Their defense also had a bounce-back year, going from the 28th-ranked defense in 2000, to the 9th-ranked.[113] Terrell Owens had become Jeff Garcia's favorite target. Garrison Hearst, who had been forced to retire from football after breaking his ankle in the 1998 divisional playoffs, finally returned to the line-up after over two years of rehabilitation. He became the first player in NFL history to come back to football after suffering avascular necrosis.[114] He had an excellent season, rushing for 1,206 yards on a 4.8 average.[115] His comeback earned him the NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award.[116] In the final six weeks of the season the 49ers defense shut out three teams (the Buffalo Bills, Miami Dolphins, and New Orleans Saints), and had one of the most stupendous goal-line stands against the Philadelphia Eagles. In the team's first playoff game in 2 years, they played against the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field in the NFC Wild Card, but lost 25‚Äì15.[117] The 2002 NFL season began with the divisional realignment. The 49ers gained two new divisional rivals, the Seattle Seahawks and Arizona Cardinals, while former divisional foes Atlanta Falcons, New Orleans Saints, and Carolina Panthers moved to the newly formed NFC South.[118] The team's production dropped from the previous year. Jeff Garcia went from having 31 and 32 touchdowns in the previous 2 seasons, to only 21 in 2002. The 49ers defense struggled at times, dropping from the 9th-ranked defense in the previous season to the 19th-ranked.[119] Even though the team did not have the same success as they did in the 2001 regular season, the 49ers won the NFC West for the first time since 1997, with the division-clinching game coming on a last-second touchdown pass to Terrell Owens against the Dallas Cowboys. The 49ers finished 10‚Äì6.[120] In the 2002‚Äì03 NFL playoffs they hosted the New York Giants in the 2002 NFC Wild Card. The Giants had a 38‚Äì14 lead late in the third quarter; however, the Giants defense, which had been highly ranked all year, began to collapse, and by the final minute in the 4th quarter Jeff Garcia had led the team back from the 24-point deficit to take a 1-point lead. Giants quarterback Kerry Collins then led a drive in the game's final minute to put the Giants at the 49ers' 23-yard line with six seconds left for a shot at a game-winning field goal. Long snapper Trey Junkin, who had been signed by the Giants that week, made a bad snap, so holder Matt Allen attempted a desperate pass down the field, which fell incomplete, but there was a flag on the play. The initial thought by spectators and the Giants was that pass interference had clearly been committed by the 49ers defense, but the flag was against the Giants for an ineligible receiver, so the game was over. The next day, the NFL admitted that the referee had blown the call, that the 49ers had indeed committed pass interference, and that the down should have been replayed.[121] A press conference was held, and a reporter asked 49ers head coach Steve Mariucci about his thoughts on the NFL saying they blew the call, and he replied: \"Bummer\". It was the second-biggest comeback victory in NFL playoff history, with the 49ers winning 39‚Äì38.[122] The 49ers lost the next week to the eventual Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the Divisional round, 31‚Äì6.[123] This was the last postseason appearance for the 49ers until the 2011‚Äì12 playoffs. Steve Mariucci, whose published statements about his degree of power in the organization had frayed already-strained relations with management, was fired by John York, despite a winning record in a clash of egos.[124] Then-Oregon State head coach Dennis Erickson was signed to a five-year contract to replace Mariucci.[125] The hiring of Erickson was highly criticized by the fans and the media, as Erickson's offensive philosophy was very different from the West Coast offense. The 2003 season was one of turmoil for the 49ers. While the Niners started the season with a 49‚Äì7 demolishing of Chicago, the team quickly began to unravel afterwards, as the relationship between Garcia and Owens turned sour upon Garcia taking issue with Owens's public praise for the play of backup quarterback Tim Rattay. Garcia responded with a cryptic remark of \"we cannot let the sickness spread\"; in response, Owens wore a surgeon's mask at the following practice. The team was also ravaged by injuries to key players on both sides of the ball; the often reckless play of Jeff Garcia started to take a toll on him, as he was forced to miss 3 games during the season. The 49ers finished 7‚Äì9 and missed the playoffs.[126] Despite this disappointing result, Erickson was retained as coach for the 2004 season. Owens' on- and off-field antics led to the 49ers trading him to the Philadelphia Eagles during the offseason.[127] Several other key 49er players were released due to salary cap concerns, including Garcia and Hearst.[128] The team finished the 2004 season with a 2‚Äì14 record, tying a franchise-worst and finishing last in the NFC West for the first time since 1979, ending what had been the NFL's longest active streak for not finishing last in a division.[129] With the worst record in the NFL the team secured the rights to the first pick in the NFL Draft. Dennis Erickson and general manager Terry Donahue were fired.[130] After an extensive coaching search, the 49ers hired the defensive coordinator of the Baltimore Ravens Mike Nolan as their head coach.[131] Nolan was the son of Dick Nolan, who had led the team to three consecutive playoff appearances from 1970 to 1972. The 49ers did not hire a general manager. In Mike Nolan's first draft as head coach, he selected quarterback Alex Smith from the University of Utah with the first overall pick of the 2005 NFL draft. It was a pick predicted by most, though many thought the 49ers might select local product Aaron Rodgers of the University of California.[132] Alex Smith's rookie season was a disaster, producing only one touchdown against eleven interceptions. The team finished 4th in the NFC West for the second consecutive year, with a 4‚Äì12 record.[133] This earned the 49ers the 6th pick in the 2006 NFL draft which they used to draft tight end Vernon Davis.[134] Alex Smith and the team improved greatly in 2006, led by second-year player Frank Gore from the University of Miami. Gore ran for a franchise record of 1,695 rushing yards, which led the NFC, along with 8 touchdowns.[135] He was awarded his first Pro Bowl appearance.[136] They also swept division rival and defending NFC Champion, Seattle Seahawks, and kept the Denver Broncos from a playoff berth in the last game of the season. However, the team finished 7‚Äì9, their fourth consecutive losing season.[137] In the off-season, the 49ers signed cornerback Nate Clements and safety Michael Lewis to improve their secondary.[138] Clement's contract was worth $80 million for eight years, the largest contract given to a defensive player in NFL history at the time.[139] In the NFL draft, the 49ers made another key addition to their defense, selecting middle linebacker Patrick Willis with the 11th overall pick.[140] Willis would eventually be named the 2007 AP NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year.[141] Before the beginning of the 2007 season, Hall of Fame coach Bill Walsh died of complications from leukemia.[142] The 49ers started the season 2‚Äì0, for the first time since 1998. In the fourth game of the season, against the Seattle Seahawks, Alex Smith suffered a separated shoulder on the third play of the game, an injury that severely hampered his play and ultimately led to an early end to his 2008 campaign after having shoulder surgery.[143] Chiefly due to back-up quarterback Trent Dilfer's struggles and Alex Smith's injury, the 49ers lost eight straight consecutive games from week three through week twelve, ending the year with a disappointing 5‚Äì11 record.[144] Questions were raised about the future of Alex Smith, whose first three seasons had been plagued by inconsistent play, injuries, and never having had the same offensive coordinator from one year to the next. Head coach Mike Nolan and new offensive coordinator Mike Martz stated that a competition between Smith, Shaun Hill, and NFL journeyman J. T. O'Sullivan would run through the first two preseason games of 2008.[145] O'Sullivan was named the 49ers starter because of his familiarity with the Martz offense and after performing better than Smith or Hill in the first three preseason games.[146] On October 20, 2008, after a 2‚Äì5 start, Mike Nolan was fired. Assistant head coach Mike Singletary, a Hall of Fame linebacker with the Chicago Bears, was named as the interim head coach.[147] Singletary proved to be a fan favorite when after his first game as head coach he delivered a memorable post-game interview. Singletary said of their loss: \"... right now, we've got to figure out the formula. Our formula. Our formula is this: We go out, we hit people in the mouth.\"[148] The team went 5‚Äì4 overall under Singletary, winning five of its final seven games and ending the season with a 7‚Äì9 record.[149] After the last game of the season, Singletary was named permanent head coach by Jed York, who had been appointed as team president just days before. Jed York is the son of John York and Denise DeBartolo York.[150] On April 25, 2009, the 49ers selected Texas Tech WR Michael Crabtree, a player many people thought would go in the top five, with the 10th pick in the first round of the 2009 NFL draft.[151] The 2009 training camp became the first since 2005 that the 49ers failed to have all drafted rookies signed and in training camp on time, as Crabtree held out trying to reach a contract. He finally reached a contract agreement on October 7, 2009, having missed the first four games of the regular season. The 49ers posted an 8‚Äì8 record after a frustrating season, losing only 2 games by more than a touchdown.[152] Nevertheless, it was the team's first non-losing season since 2002.[153] Despite missing the playoffs for the seventh straight season, several key players showed signs of improvement. Alex Smith regained his role as the 49ers' starting quarterback (after Shaun Hill had won the starting job in training camp), passing for more than 2,000 yards with 19 touchdowns, while Frank Gore collected his fourth consecutive 1,000-yard season, a 49ers record. Safety Dashon Goldson showed signs of potential in his first year as full-time starter, as he tallied 94 tackles, four interceptions, three forced fumbles, and two sacks. Vernon Davis in particular had a breakthrough year at tight end, earning Pro Bowl honors with 965 yards and 13 touchdowns (tying the NFL record for his position).[154] 2010 saw five 49ers go to the Pro Bowl: Patrick Willis, Vernon Davis, Frank Gore, Justin Smith, and punter Andy Lee.[155] The 2010 season started with the 49ers heavy favorites to win the NFC West after Cardinals QB Kurt Warner retired early in the offseason, but the season was a disaster. They started 0‚Äì5, their worst start since the dark days of 1979.[156] In week 3, the 49ers fired offensive coordinator Jimmy Raye, who had been hand-picked by Singletary in the 2009 offseason.[157] Starting safety Michael Lewis demanded to be released after he was demoted in favor of rookie safety Taylor Mays. By mid-season, Singletary was switching quarterbacks between Alex Smith and Troy Smith, who had been picked up in free agency after the preseason, but with little effect. On December 27, 2010, the 49ers fired Mike Singletary as head coach, naming defensive line coach Jim Tomsula as interim head coach for the last game of the season.[158] The 49ers finished 6‚Äì10 that season.[159] On January 4, 2011, Jed York promoted interim General Manager Trent Baalke to be the permanent general manager. Baalke had taken over the role after former general manager Scot McCloughan was relieved of his duties the year before. Two days later, on January 7, 2011, former head coach of Stanford University Jim Harbaugh was named the 49ers new head coach.[160] In the 2011 NFL draft, the 49ers selected defensive end/linebacker Aldon Smith from the University of Missouri with the seventh pick of the first round. The 49ers also selected quarterback Colin Kaepernick from the University of Nevada, Reno with the 36th overall pick in the second round.[161] After the end of a labor dispute that nearly threatened to postpone or cancel the 2011 season the 49ers made a controversial decision to re-sign Alex Smith to a one-year $4.8 million contract.[162] Because of the decision to retain Smith, and a shortened offseason with an entirely new coaching staff being hired, the team was expected to be among the league's worst by NFL prognosticators. Despite this, Harbaugh's first season was a huge success. After 10 weeks the 49ers were 9‚Äì1, highlighted by road wins against the Philadelphia Eagles, where the team came back from a 20-point deficit in the second half, and the previously unbeaten Detroit Lions. The 49ers' defense became one of the most intimidating in the league, particularly against the run ‚Äì not allowing a 100-yard rusher or a single rushing touchdown until week 16 of the regular season.[163] Alex Smith blossomed in the new system, reviving his career while playing for yet another new offensive coordinator ‚Äì his sixth in six years. In week 13 the 49ers won the NFC West with a victory against the St. Louis Rams, finally ending their nine-year playoff drought. The 49ers finished the season with a 13‚Äì3 record, earning the second overall seed in the NFC Playoffs. In the Divisional Playoffs they defeated the New Orleans Saints 36‚Äì32 after a touchdown pass from Alex Smith to Vernon Davis in the closing seconds of the game. The team reached the NFC championship for the first time since 1997 and faced the New York Giants. They lost to the Giants with a 20‚Äì17 score in overtime after two critical fumbles by backup return man Kyle Williams.[164] In 2012, the 49ers were predicted to be the NFC West champions and possibly make a run for the Super Bowl. Starting the season 6‚Äì2, the 49ers went on to face the rival St. Louis Rams in Week 10. Alex Smith suffered a concussion in the second quarter and exited the game. He was replaced by 2011 second-round pick Colin Kaepernick, who led the 49ers back to tie the game. The next week, Kaepernick and the 49ers blew out the Chicago Bears 32‚Äì7, and Harbaugh chose Kaepernick as the starter next week against the New Orleans Saints, despite Smith being cleared to play. A quarterback controversy began. Despite Smith leading the NFL in completion percentage (70%) and passer rating (104.1), Kaepernick was considered more dynamic with his scrambling ability and arm strength.[165][166] Kaepernick eventually started the rest of the season, going 5‚Äì2. Kaepernick set the record for rushing yards for a quarterback in the playoffs with 181 rushing yds against the Green Bay Packers.[167] The 49ers defeated the Packers and Atlanta Falcons in the playoffs and advanced to Super Bowl XLVII, but were denied their sixth Super Bowl win against the Baltimore Ravens, who were coached by John Harbaugh, 34‚Äì31.[168] Another storyline towards the end of the 2012 season was the reliability of kicker David Akers. Towards the end of the season, he began to show signs of decline, missing one field goal of 20‚Äì30 yards, two field goals of 30‚Äì40 yards, and six field goals of 40‚Äì50 yards for a below-average conversion percentage of 69%.[169] Akers was released on March 6, 2013.[170] Shortly afterwards, the 49ers signed veteran kicker Phil Dawson.[171] The 49ers would also trade a sixth round draft pick for wide receiver Anquan Boldin from the Baltimore Ravens, the team that had beaten them in the Super Bowl.[172] The 49ers finished 12‚Äì4 in the 2013 regular season and enter the playoffs as a wildcard, with their first game at Lambeau Field against the Green Bay Packers.[173] On January 5, 2014, San Francisco 49ers defeated Green Bay Packers 23‚Äì20. On January 12, 2014, the 49ers defeated the Carolina Panthers 23‚Äì10, thus advancing to their third straight NFC championship game.[174] However, the 49ers' season ended at CenturyLink Field in Seattle, when a pass intended for Michael Crabtree was tipped by cornerback Richard Sherman and intercepted by linebacker Malcolm Smith, losing to the Seattle Seahawks, 23‚Äì17.[175] After the Niners had their first 8‚Äì8 season in 4 years, which included losses to the Bay Area rival Oakland Raiders, Chicago Bears, and St. Louis Rams, the collapse of a once-dominant offensive line, failing to reach the playoffs, Harbaugh and the 49ers decided to part ways on December 28, 2014, after the season's final game, against the Arizona Cardinals, which the 49ers won 20‚Äì17.[176] On November 8, 2006, reports surfaced that the 49ers ended negotiations with the city of San Francisco about building a new stadium and plan to do so in Santa Clara, a suburb of San Jose; Santa Clara already hosts the team's administrative headquarters and training facility. The Yorks and then-San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom had been talking over the last few months about building a privately financed stadium at Candlestick Point that was intended to be part of the city's bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics. The 49ers' final decision to move the stadium ended the San Francisco bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics. San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Chicago were the three cities competing to be the U.S. Olympic Committee's choice to bid on the 2016 games, with Chicago emerging as the eventual victor.[177] The 49ers sponsored Measure J, which appeared on the June 8, 2010, Santa Clara ballot, to build a new stadium as the future home of the San Francisco 49ers in that city. The measure passed with 58.2% of the total vote. This was seen as the first step for the 49ers stadium relocation to a new venue to be built in Santa Clara.[178] The 68,490-seat venue, Levi's Stadium, landed rights for its first event. The stadium was home to the Fight Hunger Bowl.[179] On the 49ers website, the team's owner, businessman John York had a letter stating that after a stadium is constructed in Santa Clara, the team would retain its name \"San Francisco\" even though the team would no longer be located within Metro San Francisco.[180] United States Senator Dianne Feinstein and other leaders threatened an attempt to prevent the team from using \"San Francisco\" or the \"49ers\" in the team name, but probably would not have succeeded without changes to state or federal law.[181][182] York later confirmed in a press conference on November 9, 2011, that the team would build a new state of the art stadium in Santa Clara in time for the 2014 season. Groundbreaking for the new stadium took place on April 19, 2012.[183] On May 8, 2013, the NFL's San Francisco 49ers announced that San Francisco-based Levi Strauss & Co. had purchased the naming rights to their new stadium in Santa Clara. The naming rights deal calls for Levi's to pay $220.3 million to the city of Santa Clara and the 49ers over 20 years, with an option to extend the deal for another five years for around $75 million.[184] Jim Tomsula was hired on January 14, 2015, to replace Jim Harbaugh. Subsequently, Geep Chryst was promoted to offensive coordinator and Eric Mangini was hired as defensive coordinator. On March 10, 2015, All-Pro linebacker Patrick Willis announced his retirement from the NFL due to repeated injuries to both feet.[185] A week later on March 17, linebacker Chris Borland, Patrick Willis' presumed replacement, announced his retirement from the NFL due to fears of the effects of head trauma.[186] These two retirements left the 49ers linebackers position group weakened as they headed into an offseason under first year head coach Jim Tomsula. Two other developments during the 49ers off season, the retirements of starters defensive end Justin Smith,[187] and right tackle Anthony Davis,[188] and the uncertainty of linebacker Aldon Smith's[189] availability due to his legal issues.[190][191] The 49ers signed running back Reggie Bush, wide receiver Torrey Smith, and defensive tackle Darnell Dockett.[192] Tomsula employed new coaching practices, which included giving his players breaks to check social media during meetings, shorter, easier practices,[193] and more days off.[194] The result was one of the worst offenses in team history. Scoring only 238 points,[195] the 49ers struggled to a 5‚Äì11 season, with Colin Kaepernick ending the season on injured reserve after being benched. The 49ers would ultimately be eliminated from postseason contention in Week 14 of the 2015 regular season. On January 4, 2016, the 49ers fired Tomsula after he led them to a 5‚Äì11 record.[196] On January 14, 2016, Chip Kelly was hired as head coach.[197] Kelly's tenure began with an emphatic 28‚Äì0 victory over the Los Angeles Rams on Monday Night Football.[198] However, the team went on to lose a franchise-record 13 straight games until they narrowly defeated the Rams 22‚Äì21 on December 24, 2016.[199] On October 21, 2016, in an ESPN ranking of professional sports franchises, the 49ers were ranked the worst franchise in North America.[200] The 49ers ended up firing Kelly and Baalke following the conclusion of the regular season, finishing with a 2‚Äì14 record.[201] In 2016, Kaepernick started a trend of kneeling during the playing of the national anthem.[202] Intended to protest the treatment of minorities in the United States,[202] the trend spread throughout the NFL and stirred political controversy.[203] President Donald Trump spoke out against the protests a number of times, and Vice President Mike Pence walked out of a 49ers game in October 2017 upon seeing players kneel.[204][205] After hiring John Lynch as general manager and Kyle Shanahan as head coach, the 49ers started the 2017 season with nine consecutive losses.[206][207] During this time, they traded for New England Patriots backup quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo.[208] After a win over the New York Giants and a loss to the Seattle Seahawks, Garoppolo was named the starter after rookie C. J. Beathard suffered an injury.[209] The 49ers won their last five games with Garoppolo at the helm and finished the season 6‚Äì10. After the season, the 49ers signed Garoppolo to a five-year, $137.5 million contract extension. This made him the highest-paid player in NFL history on a per-year basis at the time.[210] During the third-week matchup between the 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs, Jimmy Garoppolo tore his ACL, and was ruled out for the rest of the 2018 season.[211] The 49ers struggled to a 4‚Äì12 record in the 2018 season.[212] The 49ers started the 2019 season with an 8‚Äì0 record.[213] This was the first time they had gone 8‚Äì0 since 1990, where they started the season 10‚Äì0 and eventually lost in the NFC Championship Game. In Week 7, the 49ers defeated the Washington Redskins at FedExField in a game referred to as a Mud Bowl with a final score of 9‚Äì0. This was the first time the 49ers shut out an opponent since Week 1 of the 2016 season, versus the Los Angeles Rams. In Week 8, the 49ers defeated the Carolina Panthers, 51‚Äì13, making it the 12th time the team has scored 50 points or more against opponents in the regular season. The 49ers' undefeated record was broken in Week 10 with an overtime loss against the Seattle Seahawks, giving them an 8‚Äì1 record. They went on to beat the Arizona Cardinals, the Green Bay Packers, and the New Orleans Saints, while losing to the Baltimore Ravens by a last-second field goal, dropping them to 11‚Äì2. The 49ers then lost their next game in the final seconds to the Atlanta Falcons.[214] The 49ers defeated the Los Angeles Rams 34‚Äì31 and advanced to 12‚Äì3, eliminating the Rams from playoff contention in the process. On December 29, 2019, the 49ers defeated the Seahawks 26‚Äì21 in the Week 17 regular-season finale thereby clinching the NFC West in addition to the number one seed for the first time since 1997.[215] In their first playoff game since 2013, against the Minnesota Vikings, they dominated the Vikings, defeating them 27‚Äì10.[216] This victory ensured them a spot in the NFC Championship game, in Levi's Stadium, where they played the Green Bay Packers. On January 19, 2020, they beat the Packers 37‚Äì20, advancing to their first Super Bowl since 2012.[217] The 49ers also became the first team to reach the Super Bowl following four straight seasons with 10+ losses. In Super Bowl LIV, the 49ers led the Kansas City Chiefs 20‚Äì10 with seven minutes remaining in the fourth quarter but lost the game by the final score of 31‚Äì20, resulting in the Chiefs' first championship victory since 1969.[218] The 49ers had a 6‚Äì10 record in 2020, usually attributed to the number of injuries on the team.[219][220] In 2021, they had a 10‚Äì7 record and advanced to the playoffs as the #6-seed.[221] On January 16, 2022, they defeated the Dallas Cowboys 23‚Äì17 in the Wild Card Round.[222] The next week, in the Divisional Round, they defeated the Green Bay Packers 13‚Äì10, the winning margin from a field goal on the game's last play.[223] On January 30, they faced the Los Angeles Rams for the NFC championship, where the Rams overcame a ten-point deficit in the fourth quarter to win 20‚Äì17, assisted in part by a costly Jimmy Garoppolo interception and a critical interception dropped by Jaquiski Tartt.[224] In 2022, they overcame their 3‚Äì4 status at the beginning of the season and vaulted into 13‚Äì4, giving them the division title.[225] Trey Lance, who was the original starter for the Niners, was injured within the first three games and replaced by Garoppolo.[226] However, after an injury during a game against the Miami Dolphins, Garoppolo was replaced by third-string quarterback Brock Purdy, who became a star within the team, winning all of his starts with 13 touchdowns and 4 interceptions in the final 5 games to clinch the NFC 2nd seed and a spot in the playoffs.[227][228] In the Wild Card Round, the 49ers defeated the Seahawks 41‚Äì23.[229] In the Divisional Round, they defeated the Dallas Cowboys 19‚Äì12.[230] However, in the NFC Conference Championship Round, both Purdy and fourth-string quarterback Josh Johnson suffered injuries. The 49ers were mostly unable to acquire offensive points as they lost 31‚Äì7 to the Philadelphia Eagles, who would move on to lose to the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LVII.[231][232] This was the last season for both Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo, who were traded to the Dallas Cowboys and signed by the Las Vegas Raiders, respectively, making Brock Purdy the titular quarterback for the 2023 season.[233][234] They opened the season with a five-game winning streak, but then lost to the Cleveland Browns off a last-minute missed field goal, setting up a 3-game losing streak heading into the bye week.[235] After the bye week, the team went on a 6-win streak and clinched the NFC West after beating the Arizona Cardinals 45‚Äì29.[236] Two weeks later, the 49ers clinched the 1st seed in the NFC by beating the Washington Commanders, combined with losses from the Detroit Lions and the Philadelphia Eagles, ending the regular season with a record of 12‚Äì5.[237] In the postseason, they defeated the Green Bay Packers in a close game 24‚Äì21 to reach the NFC Championship Game for the third consecutive season, and their fourth in five seasons.[238] In the NFC Championship Game, after being down 24‚Äì7 at halftime against the Detroit Lions, the 49ers rallied off a 27‚Äì7 run to win 34‚Äì31, allowing them to reach Super Bowl LVIII, which was a rematch of Super Bowl LIV with the Chiefs.[239] The 49ers would lose the game 25‚Äì22 in the second-ever Super Bowl to go into overtime.[240][241][242] The 49ers have won five Super Bowls, tied for most of any NFC team, their first three under Bill Walsh. Walsh retired after winning his third in 1988, but first-year head coach George Seifert did not miss a beat, winning the Super Bowl in his first year in 1989. He would also win one more in 1994.[243][244] The original 49ers logo was a mustached 49er gold miner from the 1849 California Gold Rush, dressed in plaid pants and a red shirt, jumping in midair with his hat falling off, and firing pistols in each hand: one nearly shooting his foot, and the other pistol forming the word \"Forty-Niners\" from its smoke.[258] An alternate logo with a shield-shaped crest formed from the number \"49\", with a football in the upper right quadrant and \"SF\" in the lower-left quadrant was created in 1965 and used for marketing purposes until 1972. From 1962, the 49ers' logo has been the iconic \"SF\" within the center of a red oval; throughout the years the logo has had minor modifications, such as a black outlining on the intertwined \"SF\" that was added in 1989 and a gold trimming inside the oval that was added in 1996. The San Francisco 49ers have two different uniforms: red and gold home uniforms and white, red, and gold road uniforms. However, the 49ers have changed uniform designs and color combinations quite often throughout their history. From the team's inception in 1946, they wore dark or cardinal red, switching to scarlet red jerseys and gold pants for the 1948 season, with a gold helmet with one red stripe, with solid red socks and pants with no stripes. Entering the 1949 season, the first in the NFL, the 49ers adopted three stripes to their red jerseys, wearing gold helmets and pants, with no stripes and red socks with three white stripes. In the 1953, '54, and '55 seasons, the 49ers wore red helmets with a gold stripe in the middle, with silver pants with one single stripe of red. The socks also added the three stripes similar to the jersey's. 1955 was also unique in that the 49ers wore white pants with a black stripe bounded by two red stripes, and shadow drop numbers on their red jerseys, with black shadow drop borders on the white numerals. The following season, 1956, the team wore white helmets with no stripes, and white pants with a red stripe. In 1957 the 49ers wore red jerseys, a gold helmet with no stripes, and gold pants with no stripes; for the first time the 49ers wore white on the road, as dictated by the NFL for all teams, to have at least one team wearing a light-colored jersey during games. The first white jersey had two red stripes with a gold in the middle, as was their road socks: white, with two red stripes and gold in the middle. San Francisco wore red and gold in 1958 as well, with their white jersey having a single shoulder loop stripe, as well as adding TV numbers to the sleeves of their home and away jerseys. And in contrast to the socks at home, red with three red stripes, the away socks were solid red. In 1959 the team switched to red and platinum gold (looking more like silver), and for the next several years afterwards, with their white jerseys having double shoulder loop stripes (mimicking UCLA's), but continuing with the three white stripes on the sleeves above the elbow and below the TV numbers, with the red home jerseys. In 1960, the team added \"Northwestern\" red stripes to their helmets (a thicker middle stripe bordered by two thinner stripes), and that changed in 1962, with the addition of the helmet design the team has mostly worn since: white stripe bounded by two red, with the red oval and SF logo on the sides of the helmet. In 1964 the team's colors then changed again. All silver elements were changed to what was called \"49er Gold;\" helmets were gold. New beige-gold pants with a red-white-red tri-stripe in the same style as the helmet were introduced. Uniform's basic design would be worn for practically the next 30 seasons with only some minor changes and adjustments, such as a gradual change over from sans-serif to serifed block numerals from 1970 to 1974 and a switch from thin stripes to a very thick pant striping in 1976 (during which white jerseys were also worn at home for most of that season). The uniform ensemble of red and white jerseys, and beige-gold pants with thick striping were worn until 1995 with a few minor changes. During the 1994 season, many NFL teams wore \"throwback uniforms\" on occasional games to celebrate the NFL's 75th anniversary (a corresponding diamond-shaped 75th Anniversary patch was also worn by all teams) . The 49ers chose to wear a version of their 1955 uniforms as their throwbacks, with simpler sans-serif block numerals that were outlined and shadowed in black with White pants with thinner red-black-red striping were also worn, along with the old striped red socks. The regular 1989‚Äì95 design gold helmet was worn with this uniform, as there was no logo on the 1955 helmet. In 1996, the 49ers celebrated their 49th anniversary by designing a commemorative jersey patch based on the earlier shield-crest logo. The team also debuted a substantially new uniform design, most notably changing the shade of red used in their jerseys from bright scarlet to a deeper, cardinal red a black dropshadow effect (along with gold trim) was added to the jersey numerals (which remained in the blocked serif style). As in 1994, the Niners donned white pants full-time for the 1996 season (also wearing them for the 1997 season and 1998 preseason,) though this time the pant stripes were marginally thicker and the colors were reversed to black-cardinal red-black (matching the striping on the helmets). For the 1998 regular-season opener, the team switched back to gold pants, with a more metallic gold rather than the previous beige-matte gold of the past. The striping along the side of the pants remained black-cardinal red-black, though a thin gold trimming was added, along with further oval \"SF\" logos placed on both sides of the hip.[259] The 1996 helmet and jersey design with the 1998 gold pants was worn as the team's regular uniforms until the end of the 2008 season. The 49ers once again changed uniforms in 2009, which are very similar to the classic design, albeit with several significant changes. The sleeve stripes are now set at an angle to accommodate the even shorter sleeves of modern jerseys, (though the stripes appear straight and parallel to the ground when worn by the players themselves).[260] An updated 49ers uniform with improved fit, and more breathable and moisture-resistant fabrics was debuted (alongside the rest of the NFL teams) by new league uniform manufacturer Nike on April 3, 2012.[261] On April 30, 2015, at their NFL draft rally, the team unveiled their first ever alternate uniform (as opposed to a throwback design). The uniform consists of black jerseys and pants with red numerals and striping. Nike logos are in gold, while the standard solid red socks will be worn. These uniforms will be worn a maximum of two games a year, per league rules.[262][263] In 2018, the 49ers unveiled a new alternate uniform, discarding their all-black alternates in favor of an all-white alternate.[264] It was made in the style of 1994, with the letters and numerals larger and more pronounced shadows. The helmets were the solid gold, but were used with the old 49ers logo (no striping and shadows). They wear the uniforms once every season, normally on Alumni Day. However, the 49ers wore the uniform once on the road, in their week 17 finale at Seattle in 2019. They also lobbied the NFL to wear them in Super Bowl LIV, but the request was denied. The NFL cited that the teams' uniforms with the patch were already being sold. In 2021, the 49ers unveiled a red version of the 1994 throwback uniforms for use in select home games, with the white version now worn exclusively on the road.[265] In 2022, the 49ers unveiled a new version of the uniforms. This included a saloon font and a 3 stripe jersey.[266] The 49ers official cheerleading squad is called the Gold Rush.[267] Started in the early 1980s, the first squad consisted of 14 dancers.[268] In November 2018, shortly before the start of a game against the Oakland Raiders, a cheerleader for the San Francisco 49ers appeared to kneel during the US national anthem, becoming the first NFL cheerleader to do so.[269] The act of kneeling during the national anthem began with the quarterback Colin Kaepernick to raise awareness about racism and police brutality.[270] The 49ers official mascot is Sourdough Sam. He wears jersey number 49.[271] 49er fans often take pride in their longstanding devotion to the franchise; given their extensive franchise success dating back into the early 1980s. The fanbase has spanned multiple generations since the Walsh-Montana/Seifert-Young era teams had won them five championships. Their fans are often referred to as the 49er Faithful, Niner Gang, or utilizing the acronym FTTB an abbreviation of Faithful To The Bay. A common chant utilized by the fans in recent years is the chant of \"Bang! Bang! Niner Gang!\" popularized by Bay Area rapper E-40 in 2019.[272][273] The rivalry between the Los Angeles Rams and the San Francisco 49ers is considered by many to be one of the greatest NFL rivalries ever, placing No. 8 on Sports Illustrated's \"Top 10 NFL Rivalries of All Time\" list, compiled in 2008.[274] After the Rams moved to St. Louis, Roger Craig stated in Tales from the San Francisco 49ers Sideline that the Rams would always remain the team's arch-rival, regardless of location.[275] The Rams are the only team to have played the 49ers twice every season for the last 58 seasons[276] to combine for more than 100 regular season games; the all-time regular season lead is held by the 49ers 72‚Äì67‚Äì3.[277] The rivalry regained geographic animosity following their return to Los Angeles in 2016. The rivalry has also regrown a fierce element of animosity between fans,[278][279] coaches,[280] and players alike.[281][282][283][284] The two teams have met twice in the postseason; in the NFC Championship Game. The first meeting came on January 14, 1990, when the 49ers crushed the Rams 30‚Äì3 at Candlestick Park to advance to the team's historic victory in Super Bowl XXIV.[14] Both teams later met again on January 30, 2022, when the Rams rallied from a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter to beat the 49ers 20‚Äì17 at SoFi Stadium, ending a 6-game loss-streak to the 49ers and ultimately proceeding to win Super Bowl LVI.[285] During the 2010s, the Seattle Seahawks quickly grew an intense rivalry with 49ers. The two teams began an exchange of heated regular season matchups following the NFL's realignment in 2002 that relocated both teams into the same division. Prior to 2002, the teams played each other almost every season during the pre-season, but only every three years during the regular season as part of the league scheduling algorithm. The rivalry began to intensify after the 49ers hired Jim Harbaugh out of Stanford in 2011, as he and Seahawks and former USC head coach Pete Carroll had been involved in a lengthy feud. The matchups regularly grew in intensity through the 2010s, culminating in the two teams meeting in the 2013 NFC Championship which saw Seattle advance and ultimately on to win Super Bowl XLVIII.[286] As of the 2023 season, the Seahawks lead the all-time series 30‚Äì22.[287] Though the 49ers and Cardinals initially met in 1951 and would meet occasionally until 2000, this would not develop into a full-fledged rivalry until both teams were placed in the NFC West division in 2002. Longtime-Quarterback Steve Young suffered a career-ending concussion in a game against the Cardinals on September 27, 1999, after taking a brutal hit from Arizona cornerback Aeneas Williams.[288][289] While still a close rivalry in wins; it is often lopsided on both ends. After the 49ers won nine of ten meetings between 2009 and 2013, the Cardinals won eight straight meetings between 2014 and 2018. San Francisco currently leads the series 35‚Äì29.[290] The two teams have yet to meet in the playoffs. The Green Bay Packers rivalry emerged in the mid-1990s when the Packers upset the 49ers in the 1995 NFC Divisional game at Candlestick Park, ending any chance of a Super Bowl repeat. From that point, the Packers beat the 49ers four more times including two post-season games. San Francisco was finally able to exact revenge in the 1998 NFC Wild Card round, a game that is remembered for a 25-yard game-winning touchdown reception by Terrell Owens off a Steve Young pass (referred to by some as \"The Catch II\"), lifting the 49ers over the Packers 30‚Äì27. Since that game, the Packers had beaten the 49ers eight straight times including once in the 2001 post-season, a streak that came to an end in the 2012 season when the 49ers beat the Packers in Lambeau Field week 1 for the first time since 1990, and again in the NFC Divisional game that same season. In the 2019 season the 49ers and Packers met in the 2020 NFC Championship game at Levi's Stadium where the 49ers won 37‚Äì20, but went on to lose Super Bowl LIV to the Kansas City Chiefs. The Packers also proceeded to lose to the 49ers in the Divisional Round in the 2021‚Äì2022 season. The 49ers trail the all-time series with a record of 32‚Äì37‚Äì1, though San Francisco holds a 6‚Äì4 lead in the postseason, winning the last five meetings.[291] The rivalry between the Dallas Cowboys and the 49ers has lasted since the 1970s. The NFL Top 10 ranked this rivalry to be the tenth best in NFL history. San Francisco has played Dallas in nine postseason games. The Cowboys defeated the 49ers in the 1970 and 1971 NFC championship games, and again in the 1972 Divisional Playoff Game. The 1981 NFC championship game in San Francisco, which saw the 49ers' Joe Montana complete a game-winning pass to Dwight Clark in the final minute (now known as The Catch), is one of the most famous games in NFL history. The rivalry became even more intense during the 1992‚Äì1994 seasons. San Francisco and Dallas faced each other in the NFC championship game three separate times. Dallas won the first two match-ups, and San Francisco won the third. In each of these pivotal match-ups, the game's victor went on to win the Super Bowl. Both the Cowboys and the 49ers are third all-time in Super Bowl victories to the Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots with five each. The 49ers‚ÄìCowboys rivalry is also part of the larger cultural rivalry between California and Texas. In recent years, this once-great rivalry has greatly softened, with the struggles of both the Cowboys and 49ers. However, in its prime especially in the 1990s, this rivalry was a very bitter one as both teams were the class of the NFL during this time. In what was believed to be the greatest upset in the team's rivalry in the modern era, the 49ers upset the Cowboys in the 2021 Wild Card Round. The 2022 49ers would go on to continue their winning streak against the Cowboys winning the divisional round game 19‚Äì12. The Cowboys' loss to the 49ers was their seventh straight in the divisional round, which is the longest streak in the second round of the NFL playoffs. In Week 5 of 2023‚Äì24 season, the 49ers beat the Cowboys 42‚Äì10, making it the largest win margin for the 49ers in the history of the rivalry. The 49ers lead the all-time series between the two including playoffs 20‚Äì19‚Äì1.[292] The New York Giants have the most playoff meetings versus the 49ers (eight). The playoff series is currently tied at four wins a piece, and in five of their eight meetings, the winning team has gone on to win the Super Bowl. This rivalry is rooted in the 1980s when both teams were on the rise. In the first two playoff meetings between these two teams, the Joe Montana-led 49ers won both meetings, 38‚Äì24 in 1981 and 21‚Äì10 in 1984 both in the divisional round at Candlestick Park; the 49ers went on to win their first two Super Bowl championships both seasons. The Giants won the next three playoff meetings, which included a 49‚Äì3 rout at Giants Stadium in 1986, and the 1990 NFC championship, where they upset the 49ers 15‚Äì13, ruining the 49ers hopes of a Super Bowl three-peat after Roger Craig lost a fumble late in the fourth quarter and let the Giants score on a last-second field goal. Giants also went on to win their first two Super Bowl championships both seasons. The 49ers defeated the Giants 44‚Äì3 in 1993 in the divisional round.[293] In the 2002 NFC wildcard game, the Giants were ahead 38‚Äì14 late in the third quarter; however, the 49ers came back from the 24-point deficit to beat the Giants with a 39‚Äì38 victory. The teams met again in the 2011 NFC championship at Candlestick Park, and just like the 1990 NFC championship, it was a low-scoring game; the Giants won the game on a Lawrence Tynes 31-yard field goal in overtime, 20‚Äì17. In an eerie similarity to Roger Craig's fumble 21 years earlier, Kyle Williams fumbled a punt in the crucial minutes of the game, and just like the last two times, the Giants beat the 49ers in the playoffs, they went on to win the Super Bowl. San Francisco leads the all-time series 22‚Äì21.[294] The Atlanta Falcons were also division rivals with the 49ers until the Falcons moved to the NFC South in 2002 after the realignment.[118]Just like the Saints, the 49ers had dominated the Falcons when they played in the NFC West, but the Falcons won their first four games (spanning nine seasons) against the 49ers since moving to the NFC South. Both teams met in the divisional round of the 1998 playoffs. Garrison Hearst suffered an ankle break after his foot was caught in the Georgia Dome turf and twisted severely as he tried to spin away from Falcons' defensive end Chuck Smith on the first play from scrimmage; the 49ers lost that game 20‚Äì18. They met in the 2012 NFC championship, in which the 49ers, led by quarterback Colin Kaepernick, defeated the top-seeded Falcons in Atlanta by a score of 28‚Äì24. The next year, the Falcons played against the 49ers in the final home game at Candlestick Park ever. The game ended in a dramatic interception return for a touchdown by 49ers linebacker NaVorro Bowman, known as \"The Pick at the 'Stick\".[295][296] The 49ers maintain an overall 47‚Äì32‚Äì1 against the Falcons, but are tied 1‚Äì1 in the postseason.[297] The Oakland Raiders were the 49ers' geographic rivals when the Raiders were located in Oakland. As a result, games between the two were referred to as the \"Battle of the Bay\".[298] The first exhibition game played in 1967, ended with the NFL 49ers defeating the AFL Raiders 13‚Äì10. After the 1970 merger, the 49ers won in Oakland 38‚Äì7. The rivalry still remained heated when the Raiders moved to Los Angeles, leaving many Raider fans in Northern California bitter over the move, and some of them becoming 49er fans, added with the antagonism between Northern and Southern California. The Raiders notably upset the defending Super Bowl champion 49ers in San Francisco in 1982, winning 23‚Äì17. In addition, both teams have shared a number of players, most notably Jim Plunkett, Jerry Rice, Ronnie Lott, Michael Crabtree, Tom Rathman, and Charlie Garner.[299] On August 20, 2011, in the third week of the pre-season, the pre-season game between the rivals was marked by fights in restrooms and stands at Candlestick Park including a shooting outside the stadium in which several were injured. The NFL decided to cancel all future pre-season games between the Raiders and 49ers. The final regular season matchup of the \"Battle of the Bay\" was won by San Francisco by a score of 34‚Äì3 on November 1, 2018, leaving the series tied 7‚Äì7. In 2020, the Raiders began playing their home games at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, effectively ending the geographic rivalry. The San Francisco 49ers would meet with the Raiders for the first time in Las Vegas on January 1, 2023. The 49ers would take a slim overtime win in with a field goal ending the game 37‚Äì34. As of the 2023 season, the 49ers lead the all-time series 8‚Äì7.[300] In the AAFC, the only other competitive team other than the 49ers was the Cleveland Browns, who they played twice each of the four years the league was in service; Cleveland lost four games in the AAFC, and San Francisco was responsible for two of them, including the one that broke a 29-game streak where Cleveland did not lose a game. The final game in AAFC history matched the two for the AAFC Championship, which Cleveland won 21‚Äì7. The rivalry did not last into the NFL years, particularly after the teams were placed in opposite conferences in 1970. The rivalry has turned into a friendly relationship as many 49ers personnel helped the Browns relaunch in 1999, specifically former 49ers president and CEO Carmen Policy and vice president/director of football operations Dwight Clark, who were hired by the expansion Browns in the same roles. In addition, 49ers owners John York and Denise DeBartolo York reside in Youngstown, 60 miles (97 km) southeast of Cleveland. Long-time Browns placekicker and fan favorite Phil Dawson and backup quarterback Colt McCoy signed with the 49ers in 2014. As of the 2023 season, the Browns lead the all-time series 20‚Äì10.[301] This is a partial list of the 49ers' last five completed seasons. For the full season-by-season franchise results, see List of San Francisco 49ers seasons.[195] As of April 8, 2024[update] Running backs (RB) Wide receivers (WR) Tight ends (TE) Defensive linemen (DL) Defensive backs (DB) Special teams Reserve 53 active, 15 reserve, 15 practice squad (+1 exempt) * During his tenure with the 49ers from 2006 to 2007, quarterback Trent Dilfer, a long-time friend of Brodie, wore No. 12 with his permission, unofficially unretiring the number as a tribute.[308] The Edward J. DeBartolo Sr. 49ers Hall of Fame is the team's official hall of honor for the franchise's greatest players and contributors.[309] The 10-year club is a shrine that honors members of the San Francisco 49ers who played 10 or more seasons with the organization, and was started by Bill Walsh[310] to recognize players that have shown longevity, success and consistency. Each member is shown in a black-and-white photo on a scarlet and gold plaque with their name under the photo and the years in which they played. A plaque placed in the center of the photos of club members reads: Bold indicates those elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. ‚Üí Coaching staff ‚Üí Front office ‚Üí More NFL staffs",

CD Projekt Red has officially unveiled The Witcher 4 with a gorgeous six-minute trailer that puts Ciri center stage as the new protagonist instead of Geralt of Rivia. While we didn't get a release date or window, we did learn the trailer was pre-rendered in a custom build of Unreal Engine 5 and that it will indeed still be a single-player game. IGN has a ton more coverage of The Witcher 4 for you to check out right now, including a look inside the game's development, why CD Projekt chose Ciri over Geralt, 12 vital trailer details, the lore you need to know about the game, and how the studio plans to avoid a Cyberpunk 2077-esque launch disaster this time around. It turns out our adventures in the Lands Between are not over as FromSoftware has just announced Elden Ring Nightreign - a standalone co-op spin-off set in a world parallel to Elden Ring. The game will let players team up with up to two friends and explore a condensed map of Elden Ring's Limgrage area, which will be infested with random enemies and structures at the start of each session. Elden Ring Nightreign will be released on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in 2025. To help with the wait, we're excited to reveal more with our exclusive hands-on preview of Elden Ring: Nightreign. You can also read our interview with game director Junya Ishizaki to learn why this game exists, if George R.R. Martin was involved, and why fans shouldn't think of this as a live service game. Fumito Ueda, the developer best known for such games as Ico and Shadow of the Colossus, has revealed a first look at his next project, which is codenamed Project Robot. The quick look at this project was a stunning one, with a person climbing a humanoid mech as a distorted voice counted down the time until a shockwave hit. Right before the shockwave did arrive, the player entered the mech's head and disconnected it from its body to avoid certain death. There is no release window or further details as of yet, but it's an exciting look at a project that will surely capture the hearts and minds of many when it is released. It Takes Two developer Hazelight Studios has officially unveiled Split Fiction at The Game Awards. This new adventure is once again a split-screen co-op title, but this time it stars two aspiring writers who wind up inside the same simulation of one of their stories. Each level will jump between a sci-fi world and a fantasy world, and the pair will need to figure out how to escape through \"the very worlds they created.\" Split Fiction will be releaed on March 6, 2025, and you can check out our hands-on preview of Split Fiction right here to learn more. After a bit of a hiatus, The Outer Worlds 2 has returned with the gift of a brand-new gameplay trailer and a confirmation that it will be released on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in 2025. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is officially headed to PC on January 23, 2025, which will end up being less than a year from its launch on PS5. The PC version will include numerous enhancements over its console counterpart and will obviously open the door to mods and more. Gearbox Software has revealed the first gameplay footage of Borderlands 4, which included an epic battle, Claptrap, a potential look at the playable characters, and much more. The Game Awards was the place that confirmed Virtua Fighter is officially coming back and that fans can learn a ton more on a dedicated showcase that will take place tomorrow, December 13. This is a big deal, especially as we haven't seen a new mainline entry in the franchise since 2006's Virtua Fighter 6. Yakuza / Like a Dragon developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has revealed Project Century, a new action game that is set in 1915 and looks to play very much like Yakuza / Like a Dragon. However, it does look to be a bit gorier and seems to include some sort of alt-history angle. Ninja Gaiden is returning in Summer 2025 as a 2D side-scroller called Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound. Instead of Ryu Hayabusa, players will take on the role of Kenji Mozu and face off against a demonic army. The much-anticipated Slay the Spire 2 has received a brand-new gameplay trailer and a confirmation it is still on track to be released into Early Access in 2025. Secret Level's Pac-Man episode is getting its very own game called Shadow Labyrinth, and it look to tell more of the story of this darker and edgier version of the iconic arcade character. Players will still be running around a maze and trying to eat to stay alive like the original, but this time around it looks to be more of a Metroidvania-style game. Shadow Labyrinth is set to be released in 2025 and Tekken producer Katsuhiro Harada is one of the talented individuals on the team. Sloclap's next game is one not many could have expected as its an online multiplayer soccer game called Rematch. This new game is planned to be released in Summer 2025 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, and a beta is getting ready to begin in the spring. The soccer action will take place in third-person and will see teams of five playes face off for a chance at glory. Furthermore, the game is set in caged virtual reality arenas and has no fouls or penalties or out of bounds. Dave the Diver is headed to the jungle in a brand new expansion set to arrive in late 2025. A quick trailer gives a glimpse of the adventure ahead for our favorite deep sea explorer/sushi restaurant manager. Developing...",

                "content": "LeBron Raymone James Sr. (/l…ôÀàbr…ín/;[1] l…ô-BRON; born December 30, 1984) is an American professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed \"King James\", he is widely recognized as one of the best players in the sport's history and is often compared with Michael Jordan in debates on the greatest basketball player of all time.[a] James has won four NBA championships from 10 NBA Finals appearances, having made eight consecutive appearances between 2011 and 2018.[2] He also won the inaugural NBA Cup in 2023 with the Lakers and three Olympic gold medals as a member of the U.S. national team and won the Olympics MVP in the 2024 Summer Olympics. In addition to being the NBA's all-time leading scorer and ranking fourth in NBA career assists and eighth in NBA career steals, James holds several individual honors: four NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards, four NBA Finals MVP Awards, the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, three NBA All-Star Game MVP Awards, and the inaugural NBA Cup MVP award. He has been named an NBA All-Star a record 20 times, selected to the All-NBA Team a record 20 times (including a record 13 First Team selections)[3][4] and the All-Defensive Team six times (including five First Team selections), and was a runner-up for the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award twice in his career.[5][6] The oldest active player in the NBA, he is tied with Vince Carter for the record for the most seasons played in league history, with 22. James grew up playing basketball for St. Vincent‚ÄìSt. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron, Ohio. He was heavily touted by the national media as a future NBA superstar for his all-around scoring, passing, athleticism and playmaking abilities.[7] A prep-to-pro, James was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft. Named the 2004 NBA Rookie of the Year,[8] he soon established himself as one of the league's premier players, leading the Cavaliers to their first NBA Finals appearance in 2007 and winning the NBA MVP award in 2009 and 2010.[5] James left in 2010 as a free agent to join the Miami Heat;[9] this was announced in a nationally televised special titled The Decision and is among the most controversial free agency moves in sports history. James won his first two NBA championships while playing for the Heat in 2012 and 2013; in both of these years, he additionally earned the league's MVP and Finals MVP awards. After his fourth season with the Heat in 2014, James opted out of his contract and returned to the Cavaliers. In 2016, he led the Cavaliers to victory over the Golden State Warriors in the Finals by coming back from a 3‚Äì1 deficit, delivering the team's first championship and ending the Cleveland sports curse and won his third Finals MVP.[10] In 2018, James exercised his contract option to leave the Cavaliers and signed with the Lakers, where he won the 2020 NBA championship and his fourth Finals MVP.[11] On February 7, 2023, James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the leading scorer in league history, and the following year, he became part of the first father-son teammate duo in NBA history, playing alongside his son Bronny with the Lakers. Off the court, James has earned further wealth and fame from numerous endorsement contracts. He is the first player in NBA history to accumulate $1 billion in earnings as an active player.[12] James has been featured in books, documentaries (including winning three Sports Emmy Awards as an executive producer), and television commercials. He was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2005, 2013, 2017, and 2019 ‚Äì the most selections for a professional athlete. James has won 20 ESPY Awards, hosted Saturday Night Live, and starred in the sports film Space Jam: A New Legacy (2021). He has been a part-owner of Liverpool F.C. since 2011 and leads the LeBron James Family Foundation, which has opened an elementary school, housing complex, retail plaza, and medical center in Akron, Ohio.[13][14] James was born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio, to Gloria Marie James, who was only 16 at the time of his birth.[15]: 22 His father, Anthony McClelland, has an extensive criminal record and was not involved in his life.[16][17][18] When James was growing up, life was often a struggle for the family, as they moved from apartment to apartment in the seedier neighborhoods of Akron while Gloria struggled to find steady work.[19] Realizing that her son would be better off in a more stable family environment, Gloria allowed him to move in with the family of Frank Walker, a local youth football coach who introduced James to basketball when he was nine years old.[15]: 23 James began playing organized basketball in the fifth grade.[20] He later played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball for the Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars.[19] The team enjoyed success on a local and national level, led by James and his friends Sian Cotton, Dru Joyce III, and Willie McGee.[15]: 24 The group dubbed themselves the \"Fab Four\" and promised each other that they would attend high school together.[15]: 27 In a move that stirred local controversy, they chose to attend St. Vincent‚ÄìSt. Mary High School, a private Catholic school with predominantly white students.[21] As a 6-foot-2-inch (1.88 m) tall freshman, James averaged 18 points and 6.2 rebounds per game for the St. Vincent‚ÄìSt. Mary varsity basketball team.[22] The Fighting Irish went 27‚Äì0 en route to the Division III state title, making them the only boys high school team in Ohio to finish the season undefeated.[23] As a sophomore, James averaged 25.3 points and 7.4 rebounds, along with 5.5 assists and 3.7 steals per game.[24] For some home games during the season, St. Vincent‚ÄìSt. Mary played at the University of Akron's 5,492-seat Rhodes Arena to satisfy ticket demand from alumni, fans, as well as college and NBA scouts who wanted to see James play.[25] The Fighting Irish finished the season 26‚Äì1 and repeated as state champions.[22] For his outstanding play, James was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team, becoming the first sophomore to do either.[22] In 2001, during the summer before his junior year, James was the subject of a feature article in Slam magazine in which writer Ryan Jones lauded the 16-year-old James, who had grown to 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m), as \"[possibly] the best high school basketball player in America right now\".[26] During the season, James also appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated, becoming the first high school basketball underclassman to do so.[15]: 104 With averages of 28 points, 8.9 rebounds, 6 assists, and 3 steals per game, he was again named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team,[22] and became the first junior to be named male basketball Gatorade National Player of the Year.[15]: 117 St. Vincent‚ÄìSt. Mary finished the year with a 23‚Äì4 record, ending their season with a loss in the Division II championship game.[15]: 114 Following the loss, James unsuccessfully petitioned for a change to the NBA's draft eligibility rules in an attempt to enter the 2002 NBA draft.[27][28] During this time, he used marijuana, which he said was to help cope with the stress that resulted from the constant media attention he was receiving.[29] Throughout his senior year, James and the Fighting Irish traveled across the country to play a number of nationally ranked teams, including a game on December 12, 2002, against Oak Hill Academy that was nationally televised on ESPN2.[15]: 142 Time Warner Cable, looking to capitalize on James's popularity, offered St. Vincent‚ÄìSt. Mary's games to Ohio-based subscribers for $7.95 per game on a pay-per-view basis throughout the season, but ended up not being profitable.[15]: 143 [30] For the year, James averaged 30.4 points, 9.7 rebounds, 4.9 assists, and 2.9 steals per game,[22] was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team for an unprecedented third consecutive year,[15]: 178 and was named Gatorade National Player of the Year for the second consecutive year.[22] He participated in three year-end high school basketball all-star games‚Äîthe EA Sports Roundball Classic, the Jordan Brand Capital Classic, and the McDonald's All-American Game‚Äîlosing his National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) eligibility and making it official that he would enter the 2003 NBA draft.[31] Also during his senior year, James was the centerpiece of several controversies. For his 18th birthday, James skirted state amateur bylaws by accepting a Hummer H2 as a gift from his mother, who had secured a loan for the vehicle by utilizing James's future earning power as an NBA player.[32] This prompted an investigation by the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) because its guidelines stated that no amateur may accept any gift valued over $100 as a reward for athletic performance. James was cleared of any wrongdoing because he had accepted the luxury vehicle from a family member and not from an agent or any outside source.[31] Later in the season, James accepted two throwback jerseys worth $845 from an urban clothing store in exchange for posing for pictures, officially violating OHSAA rules and resulting in his being stripped of his high school sports eligibility.[31] James appealed the ruling and his penalty was eventually dropped to a two-game suspension, allowing him to play the remainder of the year. The Irish were also forced to forfeit one of their wins, their only official loss that season.[33] In his first game back after the suspension, James scored a career-high 52 points.[34] St. Vincent‚ÄìSt. Mary went on to win the Division II championship, marking their third division title in four years.[35] As an underclassman, James played wide receiver for St. Vincent‚ÄìSt. Mary's football team.[15]: 51 He was recruited by some Division I programs, including Notre Dame.[36] At the end of his second year, James was named first team all-state, and as a junior, he helped lead the Fighting Irish to the state semifinals.[24] James did not play during his senior year because of a wrist injury that he sustained in an AAU basketball game.[37] Some sports analysts, football critics, high school coaches, as well as former and current professional players have speculated that James could have played in the National Football League (NFL).[b] James was selected by his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, as the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft.[42] In his first regular season game, James scored 25 points in a 106‚Äì92 loss to the Sacramento Kings, setting an NBA record for the most points scored by a prep-to-pro player in his debut performance.[43] At the conclusion of the 2003‚Äì2004 season, James became the first Cavalier to receive the NBA Rookie of the Year Award.[8] With final averages of 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists per game,[44] he also became the third player in league history to average at least 20 points, five rebounds, and five assists per game as a rookie.[45] Cleveland ultimately finished the season 35‚Äì47, failing to make the playoffs despite an 18-game improvement over the previous year.[46] In the 2004‚Äì2005 season, James earned his first NBA All-Star Game selection, contributing 13 points, 8 rebounds, and 6 assists in a winning effort for the Eastern Conference.[47] Around the league, teams took note of his rapid development, and Denver Nuggets coach George Karl told Sports Illustrated: \"It's weird talking about a 20-year-old kid being a great player, but he is a great player ... He's the exception to almost every rule.\"[48] On March 20, James scored 56 points against the Toronto Raptors, setting Cleveland's new single-game points record.[49] With final averages of 27.2 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and 2.2 steals per game, he was named to his first All-NBA Team.[24] Despite a 30‚Äì20 record to start the year,[49] the Cavaliers again failed to make the playoffs, finishing the season 42‚Äì40.[50] At the 2006 All-Star Game, James led the East to victory with 29 points and was named the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player.[51] Behind final season averages of 31.4 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.6 assists per game,[5] he also finished second in overall NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting to Steve Nash.[52] Under James' leadership, the Cavaliers qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 1998.[53] In his postseason debut, James recorded a triple-double in a winning effort over the Washington Wizards.[54] In Game 3 of the series, he made the first game-winning shot of his career, and made another in Game 5.[55] Cleveland would go on to defeat the Wizards before being ousted by the Detroit Pistons in the second round.[56] In the 2006‚Äì2007 season, James finished the regular season averaging 27.3 points, 6.7 rebounds, 6.0 assists, and 1.6 steals per game.[24] With a starting five featuring James, Larry Hughes, Drew Gooden, Aleksandar Pavloviƒá, and Zydrunas Ilgauskas, the Cavaliers finished the season with 50 wins for the second consecutive year and entered the playoffs as the #2-seed in the Eastern Conference.[59] In the first two rounds of the playoffs, LeBron led the team to wins over the Washington Wizards and New Jersey Nets. The Cavaliers then faced the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals. In Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals, he logged 48 points with nine rebounds and seven assists. His performance is considered one of the greatest playoff performances of all time as he scored 29 of Cleveland's last 30 points, including 25 straight, and the game-winning layup with two seconds left. The Cavaliers won 109‚Äì107 double-overtime victory over the Detroit Pistons.[60] After the game, play-by-play announcer Marv Albert called the performance \"one of the greatest moments in postseason history\" and color commentator Steve Kerr described it as \"Jordan-esque\".[61] In 2012, ESPN ranked the performance the fourth greatest in modern NBA playoff history.[62] The Cavaliers went on to win Game 6 and claim their first-ever Eastern Conference championship, earning them a matchup with the San Antonio Spurs in the Finals.[63] The Spurs at the time were coached by Gregg Popovich and featured a prime Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Gin√≥bili, and Bruce Bowen. With no other significant scoring threats, the Spurs built its defense around stopping James from getting into the paint. As James did not have a reliable jump shot yet nor another offensive weapon on his team, he struggled against the Spurs' zone defense.[64] He averaged 22 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on just 35.6 percent shooting,[65] as Cleveland was eliminated in a four-game sweep.[66] In February of the 2007‚Äì2008 season, James was named All-Star Game MVP for the second time behind a 27-point, eight-rebound, and nine-assist performance.[67] On March 21, he moved past Brad Daugherty as the Cavaliers' all-time leading scorer in a game against the Toronto Raptors, doing so in over 100 fewer games than Daugherty.[68] James' 30 points per game were also the highest in the league, marking his first scoring title.[69] Despite his individual accomplishments, Cleveland's record fell from the year before to 45‚Äì37.[70] Seeded fourth in the East entering the playoffs, the Cavaliers defeated the Wizards in the first round for the third consecutive season before being eliminated in seven games by the eventual-champion Boston Celtics in the next round.[71] During the decisive seventh game in Boston, James scored 45 points and Paul Pierce scored 41 in a game the Associated Press described as a \"shootout\".[72] At the end of the 2008‚Äì2009 season, James finished second in NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award voting and made his first NBA All-Defensive Team,[73] posting 23 chase-down blocks and a career-high 93 total blocks.[74] James also became only the fourth postmerger player to lead his team in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks in a single season.[75] Behind his play and the acquisition of All-Star guard Mo Williams, Cleveland went a franchise record 66‚Äì16 and fell just one game short of matching the best home record in league history.[76] With final averages of 28.4 points, 7.6 rebounds, 7.2 assists, 1.7 steals, and 1.2 blocks per game, James became the first Cavalier to win the MVP Award.[77] Reflecting on James' performance for ESPN, John Hollinger later wrote: \"He's having what is arguably the greatest individual season in history, and it's time we gave him his due for it.\"[78] In the playoffs, Cleveland swept the Detroit Pistons and the Atlanta Hawks to earn a matchup with the Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference Finals.[79] In Game 1 of the series, James scored 49 points on 66 percent shooting in a losing effort for the Cavaliers.[62] In Game 2, he hit a game-winner to tie the series at 1‚Äì1.[80] Cleveland would lose the series in six games, and following the loss in Game 6, James immediately left the floor without shaking hands with his opponents, which was an act that many media members viewed as unsportsmanlike.[81][82] For the series, James averaged 38.5 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 8.0 assists per game,[83] finishing the postseason with a career playoff-high 35.3 points per game.[5] In February of the 2009‚Äì10 season, James was forced into a temporary point guard role following a series of injuries to players in the Cavaliers' backcourt.[84] Behind his leadership, Cleveland lost no momentum, finishing the year with the best record in the league for the second consecutive season.[85] Despite only playing 39 minutes per game, James increased his statistical production, averaging 29.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, 8.6 assists, 1.6 steals, and 1.0 block per game on 50 percent shooting en route to another MVP Award.[86] To open the playoffs, Cleveland advanced past the Chicago Bulls to earn a matchup with the Boston Celtics in the second round.[87] James was heavily criticized for not playing well in Game 5 of the series, shooting only 20 percent on 14 shots and scoring 15 points.[88] The team suffered its worst loss in franchise history, and at the conclusion of the game, James walked off the court to a smattering of boos from Cleveland's home crowd.[89] The Cavaliers were officially eliminated from the postseason in Game 6, with James posting 27 points, 19 rebounds, and 10 assists in the losing effort.[87] James became an unrestricted free agent at 12:01 a.m. EDT on July 1, 2010.[91] During this time, he was contacted by several teams, including the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers, Miami Heat, New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, and Cavaliers.[92] On July 8, James announced on a live ESPN special titled The Decision that he would sign with the Heat.[93] The telecast was broadcast from the Boys & Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut and raised $2.5 million for the charity. An additional $3.5 million was raised from advertising revenue, which was donated to other charities.[94] The day before the special, fellow free agents Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade also announced that they would sign with Miami;[95] reports later arose that back in 2006 the trio had discussed among themselves their upcoming 2010 free agencies.[96] James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part so that he could shoulder less of the offensive load; James thought that his improved teammates would give him a better chance of winning an NBA championship than had he stayed in Cleveland.[97] Heat president Pat Riley played a major role in selling James on the idea of playing with Bosh and Wade.[98] James would be relieved of the burden of scoring, and he thought he could be the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double in a season.[97] Upon leaving the Cavaliers, James drew intense criticism from sports analysts, executives, fans, and current and former players. The Decision itself was also scrutinized and viewed as unnecessary. Many thought that the prolonged wait for James' choice was unprofessional as not even the teams courting him were aware of his decision until moments before the show.[99] Upon learning that James would not be returning to Cleveland, Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert published an open letter to fans in which he aggressively denounced James' actions.[100] Some angry fans of the team recorded videos of themselves burning his jersey.[101] Former NBA players, including Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson, were also critical of James, condemning him for forming a superteam with Bosh and Wade in Miami and not trying to win a championship in Cleveland, though Jordan did acknowledge that the options players had at the time were much more expansive than those he and others had in the 1980s and 1990s.[102][103][104] Some commentators did defend James' decision to join the Miami Heat by noting the Cavaliers' inability to build a strong supporting cast around him. They argued that other NBA greats had benefitted from talented teammates: Magic Johnson had Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy, Larry Bird had Kevin McHale (basketball) and Robert Parish on the Celtics, and Michael Jordan had Scottie Pippen with the Bulls.[105] James drew further criticism in a September interview with CNN when he claimed that race might have been a factor in the fallout from The Decision.[106][107] As a result of his actions during the 2010 free agency period, James quickly gained a reputation as one of America's most disliked athletes, which marked a radical change from prior years.[108][109] The phrase \"taking my talents to South Beach\" became a punch line for critics.[110][111] In retrospect, James has expressed some regret over his handling of The Decision.[109][112][113] James officially signed a 6-year, $110 million contract with the Heat on July 10, 2010, through a sign-and-trade deal which sent two second- and two first-round draft picks to the Cavaliers and gave the team the option to swap first round picks with the Heat in 2012.[114][115] As part of the first player-created NBA superteam[116] he became only the third reigning MVP to change teams and the first since Moses Malone in 1982.[117] That evening, the Heat threw a welcome party for their new \"Big Three\" at the American Airlines Arena, an event that took on a rock concert atmosphere.[118] During the gathering, James predicted a dynasty for the Heat and alluded to multiple championships.[119][120] Outside of Miami, the spectacle was not well-received, furthering the negative public perception of James.[121] Throughout the 2010‚Äì11 season, the media and opposing fanbases treated James and the Heat as villains.[122] To begin the year, they struggled to adjust to these new circumstances, going only 9‚Äì8 after 17 games.[123] James later admitted that the constant negativity surrounding the team made him play with an angrier demeanor than in years past.[122] On December 2, James faced the Cleveland Cavaliers in Cleveland for the first time since departing as a free agent.[124] He scored 38 points and led Miami to a victory while being booed every time he touched the ball.[125] The Heat eventually turned their season around and finished as the East's second seed,[126] with James averaging 26.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 7.0 assists per game on 51 percent shooting.[5] In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, James and his teammates found themselves matched up with the Boston Celtics for the second consecutive year.[127] In Game 5, he scored Miami's last 10 points to help seal a series-clinching win.[128] After the final buzzer, James famously knelt on the court in an emotional moment, later telling reporters that it was an extremely personal victory for him and the team.[129] The Heat eventually advanced to the Finals, where they lost to the Dallas Mavericks in six games.[127] James received the brunt of the criticism for the loss, averaging only three points in fourth quarters in the series and scored just eight points in Game 4, a game Miami lost by just three points.[130] His Finals scoring average of 17.8 points per game signified an 8.9-point drop from the regular season, the largest point drop-off in league history.[131] The 2011‚Äì2012 season was delayed by a lockout, and during that extended summer, James worked with Hakeem Olajuwon in order to improve his post up game.[132][123][133] Humbled by the Heat's loss to the Mavericks, the experience inspired James to leave behind the villain role that he had been embracing, which helped James regain a sense of joy on the court.[122] Behind his expanded skillset,[133] Miami began the year with a franchise-best 18‚Äì6 record.[134] James was eventually named MVP for the third time, finishing with averages of 27.1 points, 7.9 rebounds, 6.2 assists, and 1.9 steals per game on 53 percent shooting.[135] In the second round of the playoffs, Miami temporarily lost Bosh to an abdominal injury and found themselves trailing the Indiana Pacers 2‚Äì1.[137] James responded with a 40-point, 18-rebound, and nine-assist outing in Game 4 to help even the series.[138] To compensate for Bosh's absence, the Heat embraced a small-ball lineup with James at power forward, which they retained even after Bosh's return in the conference finals against the Boston Celtics.[139][140] Facing elimination in Game 6, James recorded 45 points and 15 rebounds to lead the Heat to victory in what The New York Times called a \"career-defining performance\".[141] Miami won Game 7 to advance to the Finals, earning them a matchup with the Oklahoma City Thunder and James' budding rival Kevin Durant.[142] Late in Game 4 of the series, James hit a three-pointer to give the Heat a lead, helping them win the game despite missing time with leg cramps.[143] In Game 5, he registered a triple-double as Miami defeated Oklahoma City for their second-ever championship and James' first championship.[144] James was unanimously voted the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player with averages of 28.6 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game.[145] His full postseason run, in which James averaged 30.3 points, 9.7 rebounds, and 5.6 assists per game, was later ranked the second best in modern NBA history by ESPN.[146] In February of the 2012‚Äì13 season, James averaged 29.7 points and 7.8 assists per game while setting multiple shooting efficiency records.[147][148] That same month, the Heat also began a 27-game winning streak, which is the third longest in NBA history.[149] Based on these accomplishments, James' performance was described as a \"month for the ages\" by Sports Illustrated.[150] Miami eventually finished the year with a franchise and league best 66‚Äì16 record,[151] and James was named MVP for the fourth time, falling just one vote shy of becoming the first player in NBA history to win the award unanimously.[152] His final season averages were 26.8 points, 8.0 rebounds, 7.3 assists, and 1.7 steals per game on 56.5 percent shooting.[5] In Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals, James scored a buzzer-beating layup to give Miami a one-point victory against the Pacers.[153] Throughout the series, his supporting cast struggled significantly, and his added scoring load prompted James to compare his responsibilities to those of his \"Cleveland days\".[154] Despite these struggles, the Heat advanced to the Finals for a meeting with the San Antonio Spurs,[155] signifying a rematch for James from his first Finals six years earlier.[156] At the beginning of the series, he was criticized for his lack of aggressiveness and poor shot selection as Miami fell behind 2‚Äì3.[83][155][157] In Game 6, James recorded his second triple-double of the series, including 16 fourth quarter points, to lead the Heat to a comeback victory.[158] In Game 7, he tied the Finals record for most points scored in a Game 7 victory, leading Miami over San Antonio with 37 points.[159] James was named Finals MVP for the second straight season, averaging 25.3 points, 10.9 rebounds, 7.0 assists, and 2.3 steals per game for the championship round.[160] On March 3 of the 2013‚Äì14 season, James scored a career-high and franchise-record 61 points in a game against the Charlotte Bobcats.[161] He converted on his first eight three-point field goal attempts through three quarters, setting a new record for the most three-point field goals made in a 60-point game. James also set the record for most points in a single game while wearing a mask. Throughout the year, he was one of the few staples for a Heat roster that used 20 different starting lineups due to injuries,[162] finishing with averages of 27.1 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 6.4 assists per game on 56.7 percent shooting.[5] In the second round of the playoffs, James tied a career postseason-high by scoring 49 points in Game 4 against the Brooklyn Nets.[163] In the next round, Miami defeated the Pacers to earn their fourth consecutive Finals berth, becoming one of only four teams in NBA history to do so.[164] In Game 1 of the NBA Finals, James missed most of the fourth quarter because of leg cramps, helping the San Antonio Spurs take an early series lead.[165] In Game 2, he led the Heat to a series-tying victory with 35 points on a 64 percent shooting rate.[166] San Antonio eventually eliminated the Heat in five games, ending Miami's quest for a three-peat.[167] For the Finals, James averaged 28.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 2.0 steals per game.[168] On June 25, 2014, James opted out of his contract with the Heat, and on July 1, he officially became an unrestricted free agent.[169] On July 11, James revealed via a first-person essay in Sports Illustrated that he intended to return to the Cavaliers.[170] In contrast to The Decision, his announcement to return to Cleveland was well received.[171][172][173] The next day, James officially signed with the team,[174] who had compiled a league-worst 97‚Äì215 record in the four seasons following his departure.[175] A month after James' signing, the Cavaliers acquired Kevin Love from the Minnesota Timberwolves, forming a new star trio along with Kyrie Irving.[176] In January of the 2014‚Äì2015 season, James missed two weeks due to left knee and lower back strains, which at the time represented the longest stretch of missed games in his career.[179] In total, James played a then career-low 69 games and his final averages were 25.3 points, 6.0 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game.[5] In the second round of the playoffs, he hit a baseline jumper at the buzzer to give Cleveland a 2‚Äì2 series tie with the Chicago Bulls.[180] In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Cavaliers defeated the Atlanta Hawks to advance to the NBA Finals, making James the first player since the 1960s to play in five consecutive Finals.[181] For most of the Finals against the Golden State Warriors, Irving and Love were sidelined due to injury, giving James more offensive responsibilities.[181] Behind his leadership, the Cavaliers opened the series with a 2‚Äì1 lead before losing in six games.[182] Despite the loss, he received serious consideration for the Finals MVP Award,[183] averaging 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game.[182] During the 2015‚Äì16 season, James was criticized for his role in several off-court controversies, including the midseason firing of Cavaliers' coach David Blatt.[184][185] Despite these distractions, Cleveland finished the year with 57 wins and the best record in the East.[186] James' final averages were 25.3 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on 52 percent shooting.[5] In the playoffs, the Cavaliers advanced comfortably to the NBA Finals, losing only two games en route to a rematch with the Golden State Warriors,[186] who were coming off a record-setting 73-win season.[187] To begin the series, Cleveland fell behind 3‚Äì1, including two blowout losses.[188] James responded by registering back-to-back 41-point games in Games 5 and 6, leading the Cavaliers to two consecutive wins to stave off elimination.[189] In Game 7, he posted a triple-double and made a number of key plays, including a chasedown block on Andre Iguodala's go-ahead layup attempt,[190] as Cleveland emerged victorious, winning the city's first professional sports title in 52 years and becoming the first team in NBA history to come back from a 3‚Äì1 series deficit in the Finals.[10] James became just the third player to record a triple-double in an NBA Finals Game 7,[191] and behind series averages of 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.3 blocks, and 2.6 steals per game,[188] he also became the first player in league history to lead both teams in all five statistical categories for a playoff round, culminating in a unanimous Finals MVP selection.[192] The 2016‚Äì17 season was marred by injuries and unexpected losses for the Cavaliers;[193] James later described it as one of the \"strangest\" years of his career.[194] Following a January defeat to the New Orleans Pelicans, James publicly criticized Cleveland's front office for constructing a team that he felt was too \"top heavy\", for which he received countercriticism.[195] The Cavaliers finished the season as the East's second seed, with James averaging 26.4 points and career highs in rebounds (8.6), assists (8.7), and turnovers (4.1) per game.[5] In Game 3 of the first round of the playoffs, he registered 41 points, 13 rebounds, and 12 assists against the Indiana Pacers, leading Cleveland to a comeback victory after trailing by 25 points at halftime, representing the largest halftime deficit overcome in NBA playoff history.[196] In Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Boston Celtics, James scored 35 points and surpassed Michael Jordan as the league's all-time postseason scoring leader.[197] The Cavaliers won the game and the series, advancing to the NBA Finals for the third consecutive time against the Golden State Warriors, who had signed James' rival Kevin Durant during the off-season.[198] Behind averages of 33.6 points, 12.0 rebounds, and 10.0 assists per game, James became the first player to average a triple-double in the Finals, but Cleveland was defeated in five games.[199] Prior to the start of the 2017‚Äì18 season, the Cavaliers overhauled their roster by trading Kyrie Irving to the Boston Celtics, who requested a trade in part because he no longer wanted to play with James.[200] After a slow start to the year, Cleveland rebounded by winning 18 of 19 games in December.[201] Their turnaround began with a victory over the Wizards on November 3 where James scored 57 points, which represented the second-highest point total of his career and tied a franchise record.[202] In January, the Cavaliers had a losing record, and James was criticized for his lackluster effort.[203] The next month, James won his third All-Star Game MVP Award, after posting 29 points, 10 rebounds, eight assists, and several key plays to help Team LeBron win over Team Curry.[204] Following another round of trades in February, Cleveland returned to form and James reached a number of historical milestones; on March 30, he set an NBA record with 867 straight games scoring in double digits.[205] James eventually finished the season with averages of 27.5 points, 8.6 rebounds, 9.2 assists, and 4.2 turnovers per game.[5] In the playoffs, James guided the Cavaliers to another Finals rematch with the Golden State Warriors.[206] Along the way, he had some of the most memorable moments of his career, including a game-winning shot against the Pacers and another against the Raptors, after which a new nickname, \"LeBronto\" was popularized.[207][208] In Game 1 of the NBA Finals, James scored a playoff career-high 51 points, but Cleveland lost 124‚Äì114 in overtime.[209] Following the loss, James injured his hand after punching a wall in the locker room, which hindered his effectiveness for the remainder of the series.[210] The Cavaliers lost the series in four games, with James averaging 34 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 10.0 assists per game for the Finals.[211] On June 29, 2018, James opted out of his contract with the Cavaliers and became an unrestricted free agent.[212] Two days later, his management company, Klutch Sports, announced that he would sign with the Los Angeles Lakers;[213] the deal was officially completed on July 9.[214] In an interview with Sports Illustrated, James's agent Rich Paul explained: \"In 2010, when he went to Miami, it was about championships. In 2014, when he went back to Cleveland, it was about delivering on a promise. In 2018, it was just about doing what he wants to do.\"[215] Reaction to the move was more positive than his original departure from the Cavaliers, albeit still mixed, as some onlookers felt that Los Angeles was not his optimal destination.[216] The Lakers expected James to immediately transform them into a championship contender after having missed the playoffs since 2014 and not appearing in the Finals since 2010.[217][218] Following his signing, the team rounded out their roster with a controversial collection of playmakers and veterans. To begin the 2018‚Äì19 season, the Lakers struggled to find effective lineups and recorded only two wins through their first seven games.[219] In November, they began a turnaround, which included two of James's strongest performances of the season. On November 14, he registered 44 points, 10 rebounds, and nine assists in a victory against the Portland Trail Blazers.[220] Four days later, James scored a season-high 51 points in a victory over the Heat.[221] After blowing out the Golden State Warriors on Christmas Day, Los Angeles improved their record to 20‚Äì14, but James suffered a groin injury,[222] the first major injury of his career.[223] James missed a then career-high 17 consecutive games, and the Lakers fell out of playoff contention without him,[222] marking the first time that James missed the playoffs since 2005.[224] In March, the Lakers announced that James would begin a minutes restriction,[225] and he was later officially ruled out for the rest of the season.[226] James' final averages were 27.4 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 8.3 assists per game.[5] Despite his inconsistent campaign, James was named to the All-NBA Third Team, marking the first time in twelve years that he did not make the All-NBA First Team.[227] \"Kobe is a brother to me. From the time I was in high school watching him from afar, to getting in this league at 18 and watching him up close, all the battles that we had throughout my career, the one thing that we always shared was that determination to just want to win, to just want to be great. The fact that I'm here now means so much to me. I want to continue, along with my teammates, his legacy. Not only for this year, but for as long as we can play this game of basketball that we love, because that's what Kobe Bryant would want. So in the words of Kobe Bryant, 'Mamba out'. But in the words of us, 'not forgotten' Live on, brother.\" During the offseason, the Lakers hired Frank Vogel as their new head coach, and traded the majority of their young core to the Pelicans for superstar big man Anthony Davis.[229] James immediately embraced the team's much-improved roster by transforming his playing style, moving to full-time point guard, and competing with a more consistent defensive effort.[230] Behind James' leadership, the Lakers opened the 2019‚Äì20 season with a 17‚Äì2 record, matching the best start in franchise history.[231] On January 25, James scored his 33,644th career point, passing Kobe Bryant for third on the all-time regular season scoring list.[232] The following day, Bryant died in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California.[233] James delivered an improvised eulogy in honor of Bryant at Staples Center, before a January 31 game against the Portland Trail Blazers.[234] In early March, before the season was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, James led the Lakers to a victory over the Milwaukee Bucks in a matchup of conference leaders, followed by a streak-breaking victory over the Los Angeles Clippers.[235] Regular season play resumed in July and concluded in August within the confined NBA Bubble, where James ended the regular season as the league leader in assists for the first time in his career, averaging 10.2 assists per game.[236] He earned a record 16th All-NBA Team selection as part of the First Team, extending his record First Team selections to 13.[237] The Lakers entered the playoffs as the top seed in the West and advanced to the NBA Finals convincingly, with only three total losses along the way.[238] In Game 5 of the Western Conference Finals against the Denver Nuggets, James helped clinch the conference championship by scoring a game-high 38 points, including 16 in the fourth quarter.[239] In the Finals, James and his teammates found themselves matched up with his former team, the Miami Heat, and quickly took control of the series with a 2‚Äì0 lead.[240] In Game 5, James had his best statistical performance of the Finals with 40 points, 13 rebounds, and seven assists in a memorable duel with Miami's Jimmy Butler, but Los Angeles was ultimately defeated in a three-point game.[241] The Lakers eliminated the Heat in Game 6, which earned James, who averaged 29.8 points, 11.8 rebounds, and 8.5 assists per game during the series,[242] his fourth NBA championship and fourth Finals MVP award.[11] At 35 years and 287 days old, James became the second-oldest player in league history to win the award,[243] and the only player in NBA history to win the award with three different franchises.[244] James and teammate Danny Green also became the third and fourth players in NBA history to win at least one championship with three different teams each.[245] The 2020‚Äì2021 season, reduced to 72 games for each team and starting on December 22, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, began after the shortest offseason in NBA history with a 116‚Äì109 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers.[246] On December 31, James became the first player in NBA history to score 10 points or more in 1,000 consecutive games in a 121‚Äì107 victory over the San Antonio Spurs.[247] On February 18, 2021, James became the third player in NBA history with 35,000 career points, joining Hall of Famers Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone; aged 36 years and 50 days, he was the youngest player to reach the milestone.[248] On March 20, James sprained his ankle against the Atlanta Hawks,[249] but was able to hit a three-point shot afterwards to keep his 10-points streak alive before exiting the game.[250] By March, the Lakers were No. 2, two games behind the Utah Jazz, but they went 14‚Äì16 without Davis and 6‚Äì10 without James, falling to No. 5.[251] James returned on April 30 after missing 20 games, the longest absence of his career.[252] In May, James was sidelined again after leaving a game against the Toronto Raptors,[253] but he returned for the final two games,[254][255] and finished the season with averages of 25.0 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 7.8 assists on 51.3 percent shooting in 45 out of 72 games;[256] this was his 17th consecutive season averaging at least 25 points per game, the most in NBA history.[257] In an injury-laden season, the Lakers ended with a 42‚Äì30 record, finishing No. 7 due to tiebreakers and facing the No. 8-seed Warriors in the play-in tournament.[258] The Lakers won 103‚Äì100 after James scored the go-ahead, three-point shot in the final minute, posting a triple-double with 22 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists, along with two steals and a block.[259] His 34-foot (10 m) shot over Stephen Curry before the shot clock buzzer was his longest basket of the season as well as his longest go-ahead shot in the closing three minutes of a game in his career.[260][261] In the first round of the playoffs, the Lakers faced the No. 2 Phoenix Suns. This marked the first time in James' career that he did not have home court advantage in the opening series.[262][263] They were up 2‚Äì1 before Davis suffered a strained groin in Game 4, in which James finished with a game-high 25 points on 10-for-21 shooting, 12 rebounds, and 6 assists.[264] The Lakers lost to the Suns in six games, marking the first time James lost in the first round in his career.[262] James finished the series averaging 23.3 points, his fourth-lowest scoring output for a series over his career and his lowest mark since averaging 22.8 in the 2014 Eastern Conference finals.[265] He made his 17th consecutive All-NBA Team selection,[3] extending the record for most selections in NBA history,[266] being named for the third time to the All-NBA Second Team.[267] For the 2021‚Äì22 season, James was joined by Carmelo Anthony and Russell Westbrook.[268] In a game against the Pistons on November 21, James was ejected in the third quarter after getting into a scuffle with Isaiah Stewart during the 121‚Äì116 victory. This was the second time in his career that he was ejected from a game,[269] and James was suspended for one game due to his actions.[270] In his next 16 games, James averaged 30.4 points, 8.9 rebounds, 6.3 assists, 1.6 steals, and 1.4 blocks on 54 percent shooting, also achieving his 100th triple-double,[271] while becoming the third player in NBA history to surpass 36,000 career points;[272] during this period, James played 35 percent of his minutes at center.[273][274] From December 19 to February 26, 2022, playing 23 out of 27 games, he had a streak of 23 consecutive 25-point games.[275] In December, James became the second player in NBA history (after Michael Jordan) to post 40 points and no turnovers at age 35 or older.[276] In January, James met the minimum criteria for points per game by playing at least 70 percent of his team's games, averaging 28.6 points, and became the oldest player to average 25+ points per game, having already been the youngest to do so, as James averaged 27.6 points per game in his sophomore season at 20 years old.[277] He also became the oldest player in NBA history to record at least 25 points in ten straight games, doing so at 37 years old.[278] By January 20, James became the fifth player in NBA history to record at least 30,000 career points and 10,000 career rebounds; he is the first player to record at least 30,000 career points, 10,000 career rebounds, and 9,000 career assists.[279][280][281] In the same period, he surpassed Oscar Robertson for 4th all-time free throws made,[282] and Alvin Robertson for 10th all-time in career steals.[283][284] In February, James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the most points scored in both the regular season and playoffs;[285] by March, he passed Karl Malone for second in the all-time minutes and regular season scoring lists.[286][287][288] At the 2022 NBA All-Star Game held in Cleveland, James was celebrated among the other 74 players for the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[289] James led all players in fan votes with his 18th All-Star selection, tying Bryant and just one behind Abdul-Jabbar;[290] his team achieved its fifth consecutive All-Star victory,[291] defeating Team Durant 163‚Äì161,[292] with James hitting the game-winning dagger shot in front of his hometown crowd.[293][294] In March, James recorded two 50-point games, which were also his Lakers' career-high,[295][296] becoming the oldest player to have multiple 50-point games in a season, as well as the first Lakers player since Bryant in 2008 to have back-to-back 50-point home games; it was James' 15th 50-point game in his 19-year career, including the postseason.[297] He also recorded his 10,000th career assist, becoming the only player in NBA history to record at least 10,000 points, 10,000 rebounds, and 10,000 assists.[298][299] On March 27, James became just the second player in NBA history to score 37,000 points.[300] Due to an ankle injury in late March, he missed out on a close three-players run for the NBA scoring title,[301][302][303] having only played 56 games, two less than the necessary to qualify;[304] aged 37, James would have broken Jordan's record of oldest scoring leader at 34.[305] For The Athletic, Bill Oram wrote that James' ankle injury felt like \"the moment that might signal the end of the Lakers season\".[306][307] On April 5, the Lakers were eliminated from both playoff and play-in contention for the first time since 2019 (James's first season with the Lakers) after a 121‚Äì110 loss to the Phoenix Suns.[308] It marked the fourth time in James' career that he missed the playoffs.[309] James was ruled out the rest of the season due to soreness in his left ankle.[310] He finished the season with a 7.6 box plus‚Äìminus (first among players in his age group) and averages of 30.3 points (first by 6.9 points among players in his age range), 8.2 rebounds, 6.2 assists, 2.9 threes, 1.3 steals, and 1.1 blocks per game on 52‚Äì35‚Äì75 shooting ranges.[311] On May 24, James was named to the All-NBA Third Team for the second time; it was his 18th consecutive All-NBA Team selection, extending the record for most selections in NBA history.[312] On August 18, 2022, James re-signed with the Lakers on a two-year, $97.1 million contract.[313][314] The contract extension made him the highest-paid athlete in NBA history at $528.9 million, surpassing Kevin Durant in all-time earnings.[315] On October 20, James made his 2,144th three-pointer in a game against the Los Angeles Clippers, surpassing Paul Pierce for tenth in all-time three-pointers made.[316] On October 28, James posted 28 points, seven rebounds, five assists, and four steals in an 111‚Äì102 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves.

He also tied Vince Carter for seventh on the all-time three-pointers made list with 2,290, and moved past Clyde Drexler for eighth on the all-time steals list at 2,208.[361] On November 21, in a 131‚Äì99 blowout victory over the Utah Jazz, he became the first player in league history to reach 39,000 career points.[362] James also broke a tie with Vince Carter, and moved to seventh place in the league's all-time three-pointers made list.[363] Six days later, in a 138‚Äì94 blowout loss to the Philadelphia 76ers, James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's record of 66,300 minutes to become the player with the most minutes played in NBA games during the regular season and playoffs.[364] The Lakers' 44-point loss was also the worst loss of LeBron's career.[365] On December 9, James and the Lakers won the inaugural NBA In-Season Tournament with a 123‚Äì109 victory over the Pacers, with James receiving the Tournament MVP award and being selected to the All-Tournament team.[366][367] On January 25, 2024, James was named an All-Star starter for the 2024 NBA All-Star Game, marking his 20th NBA All-Star selection, surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the most All-Star selections in NBA history.[368] Two days later, James put up a triple-double with 36 points, a career-high 20 rebounds, and 12 assists, including a pair of game-winning free throws, in a narrow 145‚Äì144 double overtime victory over the Golden State Warriors,[369] becoming the first player in Lakers franchise history since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1976 to put up at least 30 points, 20 rebounds, and 10 assists in a game.[370] On February 28, James spearheaded a 21-point fourth-quarter comeback by the Lakers to beat the Los Angeles Clippers 116‚Äì112, marking the largest fourth-quarter comeback of James' career and the Lakers' biggest comeback since 2003.[371] He outscored the Clippers by himself 19‚Äì16 in the final quarter, going 5-for-8 from three-point range and dishing out four assists.[372] Three days later, James became the first player in NBA history to reach 40,000 career points.[373] On March 16, he scored a season-high 40 points on 15-of-23 shooting with eight rebounds and nine assists in a 128‚Äì121 loss to the Warriors.[374] On March 31, James put up 40 points on a career-high nine three-pointers made along with seven rebounds and five assists in a 116‚Äì104 victory over the Brooklyn Nets. He also surpassed Michael Jordan for the most 30-point games (across the regular season and playoffs) in NBA history with 672.[375][376] On April 2, James passed Oscar Schmidt to become the world's all-time scoring leader in basketball history.[377] In the season finale on April 14 against the Pelicans, James scored 28 points, brought down 11 rebounds, and his 17 assists pushed his career total over the 11k mark.[378] James finished his 21st season in the NBA averaging 25.7 points, 8.3 assists and 7.3 rebounds a game. He also shot 54% from the field and a career-high 41.0% from 3-point range, making him the first player to average over 25 points and eight assists while shooting at least 50% overall and 40% from beyond the arc for an entire season.[379] On the road against the Pelicans in the play-in game, James had 23 points, nine rebounds, and nine assists to win 110‚Äì106 and clinch his 17th career playoff appearance.[380] After the Lakers fell into a 3‚Äì0 series deficit in the first round against the Denver Nuggets, James scored 14 of his 30 points in the fourth quarter in game 4 as the Lakers won 119‚Äì108 to stave off elimination.[381] In the process, James recorded his 19th career 30-point game when facing elimination and improved to 15‚Äì12 in 27 career elimination games.[382] The Lakers lost the series in five games, despite James's 30-point and 11-rebound outing in a 108‚Äì106 closeout loss in Game 5.[383] On July 6, 2024, James re-signed with the Lakers.[384] Two weeks prior, James's son Bronny had been drafted 55th overall by the Lakers. This marked the first father-son duo in NBA history.[385] On October 22, in a game against the Minnesota Timberwolves, James and Bronny became the first father-son duo to appear in an NBA game together in NBA history.[386] During his 2024‚Äì25 season debut, he tied Vince Carter for the record for the most NBA seasons played.[387] On November 13, he logged a triple-double of 35 points, 12 rebounds, and 14 assists, in a 128‚Äì123 victory against the Memphis Grizzlies. At age 39 years and 319 days, he broke his own record previously set in November 2019 for the oldest player to record a triple-double in three consecutive games.[388] Two days later, he recorded his fourth consecutive triple-double of the season with 15 points, 16 rebounds, and 12 assists, in a 120‚Äì115 victory against the San Antonio Spurs, breaking his personal record for the most consecutive triple-doubles made. He also tied the Lakers franchise record for the most consecutive triple-doubles made, joining Magic Johnson (1981, 1987) and Russell Westbrook (2021).[389] On December 1, he reached 15,000 career field goals in a 105‚Äì104 victory against the Utah Jazz, joining Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the only players to reach said milestone.[390] As a 19-year-old rookie, James made his debut for the United States national team at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece.[391] He spent the Games mostly on the bench,[392] averaging 14.6 minutes per game with 5.8 points, and 2.6 rebounds per game in eight games.[391] Team USA finished the competition with a bronze medal, becoming the first U.S. basketball team to return home without a gold medal since adding active NBA players to their lineup.[393] James felt that his limited playing time was a \"lowlight\" and believed he was not given \"a fair opportunity to play\".[392] At the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan, James took on a greater role for Team USA, averaging 13.9 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game as co-captain.[394][395] The team finished the tournament with an 8‚Äì1 record, winning another bronze medal.[394] James's behavior was again questioned, this time by teammate Bruce Bowen, who confronted James during tryouts regarding his treatment of staff members.[396][397] Before naming James to the 2008 Olympic team, Team USA managing director Jerry Colangelo and coach Mike Krzyzewski gave James an ultimatum to improve his attitude, and he heeded their advice.[396][398] At the FIBA Americas Championship 2007, he averaged 18.1 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 4.7 assists per game, including a 31-point performance against Argentina in the championship game, the most ever by an American in an Olympic qualifier.[399] Team USA went 10‚Äì0, winning the gold medal and qualifying for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China.[391] James credited the team's attitude and experience for their improvement, saying: \"I don't think we understood what it meant to put on a USA uniform and all the people that we were representing in 2004. We definitely know that now.\"[400] At the Olympics, Team USA went unbeaten, winning their first gold medal since 2000.[401] In the final game, James' statistics were ‚Äì 14 points, six rebounds, and three assists against Spain.[402] James did not play at the 2010 FIBA World Championship but rejoined Team USA for the 2012 Olympics in London, England.[403] He became the leader of the team, with Bryant, who would soon be 34, stepping back.[404] James facilitated the offense from the post and perimeter, called the defensive sets, and provided scoring when needed.[405] During a game against Australia, he recorded the first triple-double in U.S. Olympic basketball history with 11 points, 14 rebounds, and 12 assists.[d] Team USA went on to win their second straight gold medal, again defeating Spain in the final game.[407] James contributed 19 points in the victory, becoming the all-time leading scorer in U.S. men's basketball history.[391][407] He also joined Michael Jordan as the only players to win an NBA MVP award, NBA championship, NBA Finals MVP, and Olympic gold medal in the same year.[408] Afterwards, Krzyzewski said: \"[James] is the best player, he is the best leader and he is as smart as anybody playing the game right now.\"[409] After a 12-year gap, James rejoined the national team on the 2024 Olympic squad in Paris as Team Captain at 39 years old.[410] Voted by the entire 592-strong U.S. delegation, James was named as one of the two Team USA flag-bearers for the opening ceremony of the games, becoming the first male basketball player to be so honored.[411][412] James led the team in rebounds and assists. He recorded his second Olympic triple double in a comeback win in the semi-final against Serbia with 16 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists.[413] James became the first player in Olympic history with two triple doubles.[414] Team USA went on to win their fifth straight gold medal, defeating France 98‚Äì87 in the final game,[415] with James recording 14 points, 6 rebounds and 10 assists. At the conclusion of the tournament with averages of 14.2 points, 6.8 rebounds and 8.5 assists, James was named the FIBA Men's Olympics MVP and was selected to the FIBA Men's Olympics All-Star Five.[416] James became the third male basketball player to win three gold medals at the Olympics. Standing 6 feet 9 inches (2.06 m) tall and weighing 250 pounds (113 kg),[417] James has played the majority of his career at the small forward and power forward positions,[5] but he has also been deployed at the other positions when necessary.[418] His playing style, which is athletic and versatile,[133] has drawn comparisons to Basketball Hall of Famers Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan.[419][420][421] Through the 2023‚Äì24 season, James' career averages are 27.1 points, 7.5 rebounds, 7.4 assists, 1.5 steals, and 0.7 blocks per game.[5] Throughout the 2010s, he was usually ranked as the best player in the NBA each season by ESPN and Sports Illustrated.[422][423] As an 18-year-old rookie, James led the Cavaliers in scoring.[425] He holds numerous \"youngest to\" distinctions,[426][427] including being the youngest player to score 30,000 career points.[428] During his first stint in Cleveland, James was primarily used as an on-ball point forward, and although his shooting tendencies were perimeter-oriented,[133] he established himself as one of the best slashers and finishers in basketball.[429][430] His combination of speed, quickness, and size often created matchup problems for opposing teams because James was capable of blowing by larger defenders and overpowering smaller ones.[431] These qualities became more apparent in transition, where he developed a reputation for grabbing defensive rebounds and then beating the defense downcourt for highlight reel baskets.[432] Around this time, James was frequently criticized for not having a reliable jump shot or post game.[433] Teams would try to exploit these weaknesses by giving him space in the half court and forcing him to settle for three-pointers and long two-pointers, a strategy famously used by Spurs coach Gregg Popovich in the 2007 Finals, where James converted on only 36 percent of his field goals in four games.[434] In Miami, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra changed James' role to a more unconventional one.[133] James spent more time in the post and improved his shot selection and accuracy on jump shots.[133][435] He also learned how to work as an off-ball cutter in the Heat's \"pass-happy\" offense.[436] Behind these improvements, James' overall scoring efficiency rose to historically great levels.[437] During this time, ESPN's Tom Haberstroh called James's free-throw shooting his biggest weakness, describing it as \"average\".[438] Upon returning to the Cavaliers, James began to experience subtle age-related declines in productivity,[439] posting his lowest scoring averages since his rookie season in 2015 and 2016.[5][440] His shooting also temporarily regressed, and James briefly ranked as the NBA's worst high-volume shooter from outside the paint.[441] Despite these changes, he remained an elite offensive player who beat defenses with body control, strength, and varying attacking speeds.[431] For most of his career, James has controlled the offense as the primary ball handler on his team.[442] His playmaking ability is generally considered one of his premier skills, and some analysts rank him among the greatest passers in NBA history.[443] By exploiting his size, vision, and the attention James garners from opposing defenses,[444] he creates easy points for his teammates with accurate assists.[445] James executes unconventional passes, including after leaving his feet and through defensive traffic.[446] His uncanny tendency to find the open man has helped force NBA teams to incorporate some elements of zone into their schemes to better cover the weak side of the court and prevent James from passing to open shooters.[431] Early in his career, James was criticized for overpassing in pressure situations, in particular for passing instead of shooting in the waning seconds of close games;[447][448] however, as his career progressed, James' clutch performance was viewed more favorably.[449] At the beginning of his NBA career, James was considered a poor defensive player,[450] but he improved steadily through the years. In 2009, James became proficient at the chase-down block, which involves coming in from behind the opposition in transition to block the shot.[74] In Miami, he developed into a more versatile defensive player, and the Heat relied on him to guard all five positions.[451] Along with Shane Battier and Dwyane Wade, Miami used James in an ultra-aggressive defensive scheme,[452] with James cheating off the ball to help out inside or get into rebounding position.[453] Beginning in 2014, some analysts reported a regression in his defensive impact, stemming from a lack of effort and expected age-related declines.[454][455] During his second stint in Cleveland, James' defense progressively declined. After missed drives on offense, he often dawdled back on defense while complaining to the referees; he provided less help off the ball, and was less aggressive in switching.[456] James himself admitted to taking plays off at times, referring to this approach as \"chill mode\".[457] He eventually developed a reputation for raising his defensive level in the playoffs, which some analysts referred to as \"Playoff LeBron\".[458] James left high school as one of the most hyped prospects in NBA history.[e] Upon entering the NBA, he made an immediate impact and was voted Rookie of the Year in his debut season.[464] As of 2024, James has been named to 20 All-NBA Teams, including 13 times to the First Team, which are both NBA records.[3] His four MVP awards are matched only by Michael Jordan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, and Bill Russell; James and Russell are the only players to win four MVP awards in a five-year span.[465] James has also won four Finals MVP Awards, which is the second-most all-time,[466] and earned All-Defensive honors every season from 2009 to 2014.[5] While James has never won the Defensive Player of the Year Award, he has finished second in the voting twice and lists it as one of his main goals.[73][467] His teams have appeared in the Finals ten times and won four championships; his 10 Finals appearances are tied for third all-time.[f] Some analysts have criticized him for not having a better Finals record, while others have countered that James usually performed well but his team was defeated by superior competition.[469][470][471] On the basis of his career longevity and on-court performances, sports publications have consistently included James in rankings of the best basketball players in history,[g] and he was named the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Decade for the 2010s.[479] This has resulted in frequent comparisons to Michael Jordan.[a] In a 2016 interview with Sports Illustrated, James acknowledged that his motivation was surpassing Jordan as the greatest.[480] In February 2018, The Ringer spent an entire week devoted to both players, with Bill Simmons ultimately concluding that Jordan was still ahead.[481] In polls, James has ranked second behind Jordan.[482][483][484] The results strongly correlate with age, with older voters more commonly choosing Jordan.[483][484] Davis et al. of Business Insider stated: \"The data would suggest that younger, more-engaged NBA fans lean toward James, as he's still playing. Older generations who watched Jordan play and tune in less today lean toward Jordan.\"[484] Referring to James as the best challenger to Jordan's status as the greatest basketball player of all time, Sam Quinn of CBS Sports stated that \"the margin for error where Jordan is involved is overwhelmingly slim\" and that \"in the rings-obsessed basketball discourse\", Jordan having more titles and an \"unblemished Finals record holds significant weight\".[480] In addition to praising James' on-court accomplishments, analysts have also noted his influence on player empowerment throughout the NBA, which stemmed from his willingness to change teams during free agency. Ben Golliver of The Washington Post opined that James' move to the Heat in 2010 \"defined a decade of player movement\", and that he \"fundamentally flipped the power balance between stars and their organizations.\"[485] James' fellow players have also remarked on his influence, such as Warriors forward Draymond Green, who reflected: \"We've taken control of our destiny. And I think a lot of people hate that ... I think the doors that he's opened for athletes and especially basketball players is his biggest accomplishment.\"[486] Multiple current and former NBA players have suggested James' free agency decisions catalyzed the leaguewide trend in \"superteams\" in the 21st century.[487][488][489][490][491] In 2022, James voiced his desire to play into his forties potentially alongside or against his sons Bronny and Bryce.[492] This eventually happened when Bronny was selected by the Lakers 55th overall in the 2024 NBA draft, making them the first father-son duo in NBA history.[493] James married his high school sweetheart, Savannah James, on September 14, 2013, in San Diego, California.[494] They have three children: sons Bronny and Bryce, and daughter Zhuri.[492][495] Bronny was a standout high school basketball player, being named a McDonald's All-American in 2023, 20 years after James's selection.[496] During his stint with the Heat, James resided in Coconut Grove, where he bought a $9 million three-story mansion overlooking Biscayne Bay.[497] In November 2015, James bought a 9,350 square-foot (870 m2) East Coast-style mansion in Brentwood, Los Angeles, for about $21 million.[498] He purchased another home in Brentwood in December 2017 for $23 million.[499] In September 2020, he purchased a third home in Los Angeles, this one in Beverly Hills for $36.75 million.[500] James also owns a 30,000 square foot mansion in Akron, Ohio that he custom built in 2003 on his property and spent $2.1 million on it.[501] James's best friends in the NBA are Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, and former Heat teammate Dwyane Wade. The four have been referred to as the \"banana boat crew\". During an excursion to the Bahamas, James rescued Anthony from the water when Anthony was carried away from the boat by the current. During an Instagram Live session, Anthony later recounted: \"He saved my life\". When asked about how much danger Anthony was in prior to the rescue, James responded: \"I don't really know what to say, to be honest. I'm just happy he's still here, obviously.\"[502] James also maintains a friendship with fellow NBA player Draymond Green.[503] James invests heavily in his health, reportedly spending $1.5 million a year to pay for personal chefs, athletic trainers, and physical therapies for recovery. Kyle Korver has described James's fitness as being on \"another level\". However, James' routine is not perfectly clean; he drinks wine every night, believing it to be good for his heart,[504] while Tristan Thompson has stated that James eats desserts with every meal.[505] In January 2009, doctors at the Cleveland Clinic discovered a growth in the right side of James's jaw. Biopsy results showed that James developed a benign jaw tumor, specifically in his parotid gland,[506] which required a five-hour surgery to remove on June 2 after the end of the Cavaliers' run in the 2009 playoffs.[507] James is considered by fellow NBA players, media tabloids, and popular culture to be the \"face of the NBA\", often alongside Warriors superstar Stephen Curry.[508][509] His opinions have yielded significant influence on people who make important league decisions; for example, in 2014, James asked commissioner Adam Silver to increase the duration of the All-Star break, and the request was granted the following season.[510] On February 13, 2015, James was elected the first vice president of the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA).[511] Throughout his career, James has been ranked by Forbes as one of the world's most influential athletes,[h] and has been listed by Time as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.[514] During his first stint with the Cavaliers, James was adored by local fans, and Sherwin-Williams displayed a giant Nike-produced banner of James on its world headquarters.[515] Despite their affection for James, Cleveland fans and critics were frequently annoyed when he sported a Yankees hat when he attended Cleveland Indians baseball games against the New York Yankees.[516] Following his actions during the 2010 free agency period and The Decision, James was listed as one of the most disliked athletes in the United States.[517] By 2013, his image had mostly recovered and he was reported by ESPN as the most popular player in the NBA for the second time in his career.[518] In 2014, James was named the most popular male athlete in America by the Harris Poll.[519] He has led the league in jersey sales six times.[520] Memorabilia associated with James is highly sought after; two of James' rookie cards are among the most expensive basketball cards ever sold at auction, and one of those cards also briefly held the record for the most expensive modern-day sports card when it sold for $1.8 million at auction in July 2020.[523] A Mike Trout rookie card broke the record for a modern-day card the following month.[524] All jerseys worn in the 2020 NBA All-Star Game were auctioned by the NBA and NBPA to raise funds for charity; James' jersey sold for $630,000, setting a record for a modern-day sports jersey.[525] In March 2008, James became the first black man, as well as the third man overall after Richard Gere and George Clooney, to appear on the cover of Vogue, when he posed with Gisele B√ºndchen.[526] In response, ESPN columnist Jemele Hill considered the cover offensive and \"memorable for the wrong reasons\", describing the demeanor of James and his holding B√ºndchen as a reference to classic imagery of the movie monster King Kong, a dark savage capturing his fair-skinned love interest.[521][522] James has maintained close ties to his hometown of Akron, Ohio, which is also where his charity foundation, the LeBron James Family Foundation (LJFF), is based.[527] Since 2005, the foundation has held an annual bike-a-thon to raise money for various causes.[528] In 2015, James announced a partnership with the University of Akron to provide scholarships for as many as 2,300 children beginning in 2021.[529] In 2017, he received the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award from the NBA for his \"outstanding service and dedication to the community.\"[530] In November 2017, the Akron School Board approved the I Promise School, a public elementary school created in a partnership with the LJFF to help struggling elementary school students stay in school.[531] The school officially opened on July 30, 2018, with James reflecting that it was his most important professional accomplishment.[532] Other noteworthy public and charitable initiatives undertaken by James in Akron include the I Promise Institute at the University of Akron,[533] I Promise Village (housing complex),[534] House Three-Thirty (community center/retail plaza),[535] and I Promise Health Quarters (medical center).[14] James is also an active supporter of various non-profit organizations, including After-School All-Stars, Boys & Girls Clubs of America, and Children's Defense Fund.[536][537][538] In 2016, he donated $2.5 million to the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture to support an exhibit on Muhammad Ali.[539] Throughout his career, James has taken public stances on controversial issues, and has mentioned a feeling of obligation to effect change using his status.[540] Those include the War in Darfur,[541] the killing of Trayvon Martin,[542] the now-former NBA owner Donald Sterling's racist comments in 2014,[540] the Michael Brown verdict,[543] the death of Eric Garner,[544] the U.S. national anthem kneeling protests,[545] the shooting of Breonna Taylor,[546] the death of Ma'Khia Bryant,[547] Kyle Rittenhouse,[548] and the ruling of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization that overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.[549] On August 27, 2020, James and his Lakers teammates, as well as the Bucks, began boycotting the 2020 NBA playoffs to protest the shooting of Jacob Blake.[550] In response, senior White House advisor Jared Kushner stated that he was planning to reach out to James regarding the boycott. Following a players' committee to discuss the boycott, James and others reached out to former president Barack Obama, who reportedly advised them to continue playing and finish that year's NBA season.[551] During the 2019‚Äì2020 Hong Kong protests, a statement James made about a since-deleted tweet by Daryl Morey,[552] in which Morey expressed support for the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, became the subject of controversy. James said Morey was \"misinformed\".[553] His statement drew backlash from protesters in the movement.[554][555] In February 2022, political commentator Bill Maher called James hypocritical for not taking a critical stance towards the Chinese government's human rights abuses.[556] James had taken various other stands on issues regarding sports, such as the Kaepernick controversy and the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal.[557][558] In October 2023, in response to the 2023 Israel‚ÄìHamas war, James voiced his support for Israel on Instagram.[559] His statement drew backlash for its omission of the Palestinians affected by the crisis, including from Palestinian-American leader and activist Omar Suleiman.[560][561][562] In June 2008, James donated $20,000 to a committee in support of Barack Obama for the 2008 U.S. presidential election.[563] Later that year, James gathered almost 20,000 people at the then-called Quicken Loans Arena for a viewing of Obama's 30-minute American Stories, American Solutions television advertisement.[564] The advertisement was shown on a large screen above the stage, where Jay-Z later held a free concert.[564] In November 2016, James endorsed and campaigned for Hillary Clinton for the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[565] Following a racist incident at his Los Angeles home in 2017, James expressed that \"being black in America is tough. We got a long way to go for us as a society and for us as African Americans until we feel equal in America.\"[566] Later on that year, in the aftermath of the Unite the Right rally, James questioned the \"Make America Great Again\" slogan and said: \"It's sad what's going on in Charlottesville. Is this the direction our country is heading? Make America Great Again huh? Our youth deserve better!!\"[567] James also called President Donald Trump a \"bum\" after the president rescinded a White House invitation to Stephen Curry.[568] During a 2018 interview with CNN journalist Don Lemon, James then accused Trump of attempting to divide the country with sports, suggesting that \"sports has never been something that divides people it's always been something that brings someone together.\" He declared that he would \"never sit across from him. I'd sit across from Obama though.\"[569][570] In response, Trump tweeted: \"LeBron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon. He made LeBron look smart, which isn't easy to do.\"[571] On August 19, 2020, James announced his intentions to support the Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign and that of his running-mate Kamala Harris in advance of the 2020 U.S. presidential election.[572] James spoke in support of the More Than a Vote movement and encouraged members of the African-American community to vote,[573] saying, \"People in our community have been just lied to for so many years. We have people that have had convictions in the past, that've been told they cannot vote because they got a conviction. That is voter suppression.\"[574] On October 31, 2024, James announced his support for the Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.[575] According to Forbes, in May 2023, James became the first active NBA player to become a billionaire.[576] James' biography LeBron was published on April 11, 2023, by Jeff Benedict. The biography is based on three years of research and more than 250 interviews.[577] James has signed numerous endorsement contracts; some of the companies that he has done business with are AT&T,[578] Audemars Piguet,[579] Beats by Dre,[580] Blaze Pizza,[581] Coca-Cola,[582] Dunkin' Brands,[583] Intel,[584] Kia,[585] McDonald's,[586] Nike,[582]PepsiCo,[587] State Farm,[588] and Taco Bell.[589] Coming out of high school, James was the target of a three-way bidding war among Nike, Reebok, and Adidas,[590] eventually signing a seven-year deal with Nike in 2003[591] for approximately $90 million.[592] His signature shoes have performed well for Nike.[593] In 2011, Fenway Sports Group became the sole global marketer of his rights, and as part of the deal, James was granted a minority stake in the English Premier League football club Liverpool,[594] who he has claimed his support for.[595] As a result of his endorsement money and NBA salary, James has been listed as one of the world's highest-paid athletes.[596] In 2013, he surpassed Bryant as the highest paid basketball player in the world, with earnings of $56.5 million.[597] In 2014, James realized a profit of more than $30 million as part of Apple's acquisition of Beats Electronics; he had originally struck a deal to get a small stake in the company at its inception in exchange for promoting its headphones.[598] In 2015, James was ranked the sixth highest earning sportsperson,[599] and third highest in 2016 (after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi).[600] James has stated that he would like to own an NBA team in the future, albeit in a hands-off capacity.[601] In 2011, James co-founded the designer retail store UNKNWN in Miami, Florida.[602] During Super Bowl LVI in 2022, James appeared in a Crypto.com advertisement, where he conversed with a CGI version of his younger self, offering advice about the future. The commercial, produced by James' SpringHill Company and directed by Calmatic, did not directly promote the service, sparked social media buzz, and inspired a series of memes centered on the advice he could have offered.[603] Subsequently, Crypto.com launched an NFT airdrop campaign, distributing 5,550 tokens featuring the NBA champion. Participants were chosen randomly from those who scanned a QR code in the Super Bowl ad.[604] Also, in 2022, James' charity LeBron James Family Foundation, partnered with Crypto.com to educate underserved Akron communities with blockchain-related knowledge and Web3 tools, aiming to ensure inclusive advancement in the digital age.[605][606] James and comedian Jimmy Kimmel co-hosted the 2007 ESPY Awards.[607] In other comedic pursuits, he hosted the 33rd-season premiere of Saturday Night Live.[608] James has also tried his hand at acting, appearing in a cameo role on the HBO series Entourage.[609] In 2015, he played himself in the Judd Apatow film Trainwreck,[610] receiving positive reviews for his performance.[611] That same year, James' digital video company Uninterrupted raised $15.8 million from Warner Bros. Entertainment and Turner Sports to help expand the company's efforts to bring athlete-created content to fans. It is hosted on Bleacher Report and is used by several other athletes including Tampa Bay Buccaneers tight end Rob Gronkowski and cornerback Richard Sherman.[612] James and his business partner Maverick Carter own production company SpringHill Entertainment,[613] whose first work was the Lions Gate documentary More Than a Game, which was released in 2009 and chronicled James' high school years.[614] Series produced by SpringHill include the NBC game show The Wall,[615] the Disney XD sports documentary show Becoming,[616] the Starz sitcom Survivor's Remorse,[617] and the animated web series The LeBrons.[618] In 2016, CNBC aired an unscripted series hosted by James called Cleveland Hustles, where four up-and-coming Northern Ohio entrepreneurs will be financed on the condition of revitalizing a neighborhood in Cleveland.[619] In the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, a 60-minute Vince Carter documentary entitled The Carter Effect was executive produced by James and Maverick Carter along with rapper Drake and Future the Prince.[620][621] In February 2018, it was announced that James' production company will produce a new film in the House Party series with James expected to make a cameo.[622] Later that month, Fox News host Laura Ingraham told James to \"shut up and dribble\" as a response to his political agendas.[623] This largely contributed to James creating a documentary film series looking at the changing role of athletes in the current political and cultural climate, aptly named, Shut Up and Dribble on Showtime.[624] James partnered with Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2018 to found Ladder, a company that developed nutritional supplements to help athletes with severe cramps after dealing with that issue during the 2014 Finals.[625] In February 2019, it was revealed that James would executive produce rapper 2 Chainz's new album Rap or Go to the League.[626] A Def Jam press release said the intent of the album is \"celebrating black excellence and focusing on the power of education and entrepreneurship.\" The press release also says the title \"challenges the notion that the only way out of the inner city is either to become a rapper or a ball player.\"[627] As of June 2023, James is the most followed basketball player on Instagram, with over 155 million followers.[628] In June 2022, it was announced James was launching a media company in partnership with professional tennis player Naomi Osaka and Maverick Carter. The production and content creation company will be named Hana Kuma, which means \"flower\" and \"bear\" in Japanese.[629] In March 2024, James and JJ Redick launched a podcast called Mind the Game, where the two have \"pure conversations about basketball.\"[630][631][632] In 2012, James, Carter and Paul Wachter made an investment of less than $1 million in the Pasadena-based fast casual chain Blaze Pizza; their investment had grown to $25 million by 2017.[633] James later became a spokesman for the company and began appearing in advertisements after ending his contract with McDonald's.[633] During the 2019 offseason, James filed for a trademark through a shell company on the term \"Taco Tuesday\" for use in downloadable audio/visual works, podcasts, social media, online marketing, and entertainment services.[634] This was related to James's use of the term on Instagram for his family's taco dinners. The request was denied by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, stating that Taco Tuesday was \"a commonplace term, message or expression widely used by a variety of sources that merely conveys an ordinary, familiar, well-recognized concept or sentiment.\"[635] In November 2020, James became an angel investor of the tequila and mezcal company Lobos 1707.[636] After personal frustration with comments on the Black Lives Matter movement made by Republican U.S. senator Kelly Loeffler, who at the time was the owner of the WNBA's Atlanta Dream, James assisted Dream player Renee Montgomery in her ultimately successful bid to buy the team in March 2021.[637] That same year, James joined Fenway Sports Group as a partner, making him a part-owner of the Boston Red Sox, New England Sports Network, RFK Racing, and Liverpool F.C., the latter of which he already owned a two-percent share in individually.[638] The investment made James and Carter the company's first black partners.[638] James has expressed his interest in owning an NBA team once he finishes playing basketball, specifically a team located in Las Vegas, Nevada, either through expansion or relocation.[639] In August 2022, James, alongside Canadian musician Drake, became part owners of the Italian football club A.C. Milan.[640] James is also a part owner of the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League (NHL).[641] James is represented by agent Rich Paul of Klutch Sports.[642] His first agent was Aaron Goodwin, whom he left in 2005 for Leon Rose. Rose joined Creative Artists Agency (CAA) in 2007, and he worked with fellow CAA agent Henry Thomas, who represented Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, to bring James to Miami in 2010. James left CAA for Paul in 2012.[643] James, Paul, Maverick Carter, and Randy Mims‚Äîall childhood friends‚Äîformed agent and sports-marketing company LRMR after James left Goodwin. LRMR handles James's marketing, including the marketing of The Decision, for which it was criticized.[644][645] Throughout his career, James has taken a unique approach to his NBA contracts, usually opting to sign shorter-term deals in order to maximize his earnings potential and flexibility;[115][646][647] in 2006, James and the Cavaliers negotiated a three-year, $60 million contract extension instead of the four-year maximum as it allotted him the option of seeking a new contract worth more money as an unrestricted free agent following the 2010 season.[648] This move ultimately allowed James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh to sign together with the Heat.[649] During the 2011 NBA lockout, James received contract offers to play professional football from the Dallas Cowboys and Seattle Seahawks,[650] which he gave serious consideration to and even began training with it in mind.[651] During his second stint in Cleveland, based on a negotiation strategy devised by NBA agent Mark Termini, who worked with Paul and specialized in contract negotiation and construction,[652] James began opting out,[653] or re-signing,[654][655] on new contracts after each season in order to take advantage of higher salaries resulting from the NBA's rising salary cap.[174] In 2016, he signed with the Cavaliers on a three-year deal,[656] becoming the highest-paid player in the league for the first time in his career.[657]",

                "content": "LeBron Raymone James Sr. (born December 30, 1984[2]) is an American professional basketball player who plays in the National Basketball Association (NBA) on the Los Angeles Lakers with 17 titles. He is married with Savannah Brinson James and has 3 children. They are Bronny James, Bryce James, and Zhuri James. He is also a film producer and a business man. Among the best basketball players of the twenty-first century, he has a lot of experience. Both Space Jam: A New Legacy and Trainwreck featured him as himself. He is the proprietor of the SpringHill Company. The Cleveland Cavaliers picked him in the 2003 NBA Draft with the first pick in the draft, not only for his athletics ability but for the revenue he could bring to the team and city. James did not play college basketball, and entered the NBA Draft immediately after high school. He went to high school in Akron, Ohio. James played with the Cavaliers for his first seven seasons. During that time, he was one of the NBA's top scorers. He was selected as an All-Star several times. In 2007, he led Cleveland to the NBA Finals. He was the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the NBA for the 2008-09 NBA season and 2009-10 NBA season. On July 8, 2010, on a show in ESPN called \"The Decision\" LeBron said that he would next play for the Miami Heat.[3] On December 2, 2010, James played in Cleveland for the first time since leaving, scoring 38 points for the Heat as they beat the Cavaliers, 118-90. Many fans angry at James for leaving Cleveland booed him throughout the game and held up signs with negative statements against James.[4] In the 2011 season the Miami Heat came in second place right behind the Chicago Bulls lead by Derrick Rose in the NBA. They made it to the finals of the NBA and lost in six games to the Dallas Mavericks [5] This caused celebration in Cleveland because they hated LeBron for what he did to them.[6] In the 2012 Finals, LeBron James won his first championship after the Miami Heat defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder 4-1 games, after battling with the Boston Celtics 4-3 games the previous round. The next year, LeBron James won his second title when the Heat defeated the San Antonio Spurs in seven games. In both years he won the MVP title of finals and of regular season. In 2014, James competed a good season but he wasn't the MVP. In the 2014 Finals, the Heat's Finals streak ended after being defeated by the San Antonio Spurs in five games (4-1).[7] Shortly after those Finals had ended, LeBron James said he would use an early termination option in his contract, leaving the Miami Heat and becoming a free agent. He said this on June 24, 2014.[8] Then, on June 25, 2014, in a first-person essay in Sports Illustrated, he said he would return to the Cleveland Cavaliers. On July 12, 2014, James signed a two-year, $42.1 million contract to return to the Cavaliers. The deal also contains an option to become a free agent again after the 2014‚Äì15 NBA season.[9] LeBron now plays on the Los Angeles Lakers. In 2015, he took the Cleveland Cavaliers to the NBA Finals, without Kevin Love but lost to the Golden State Warriors in 6 games after losing Kyrie Irving after he had an ankle injury. He led the Cleveland Cavaliers to an NBA championship after being down 3-1 games to their first-ever title in 2016 and later played a crucial role in bringing glory to the Los Angeles Lakers.[10] No team had ever come back from a 3-1 deficit in the Finals before. He had a historic moment where he blocked Andre Iguodala on possibly the game winning layup. The Cavaliers went on to lose to the Golden State Warriors the following season. Now with the Lakers he passed Kobe Bryant. On August 18, 2022, James re-signed with the Los Angeles Lakers on a two-year, $97.1M deal.[11][12] The contract extension made James the highest-paid athlete in NBA history at $528.9M, surpassing Kevin Durant in all-time earnings.[13] In 2021, James starred in Space Jam: A New Legacy where he played a version of himself. LeBron is widely considered to be the greatest basketball player of all time, as well as one of the most influential athletes and sports players in the world.[14] On February 7, 2023, James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's 38,387-point total during a game against the Oklahoma City Thunder. Currently, LeBron is staying at 40,474, which is 2087 higher than Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. He was the youngest player to reach this point. He is also well known for his assists, and with 10,759, he is now the player with the fourth-most assistances. James and Michael Jordan are the only players to win an NBA MVP award, NBA title, NBA Finals MVP, and Olympic gold medal in the same calendar year. The USA would go on to win the Olympics twice.[15] Since even before he made his NBA debut, James has been associated with Nike. They In 2003, he agreed to a seven-year contract with the business that was worth little under $90 million. Many people at the time questioned whether Nike put a little too much faith in an 18-year-old who had never played a professional game. LeBron became one of the biggest players in the NBA and a four-time MVP as a result of the risk, which paid off brilliantly. James has been a success for Nike off the court as well, in addition to on it. Until now the sales of his signature sneaker reached $340 million between February 2014 and January 2015, making him the highest-paid employee at the company.[16]",

LeBron James, who was born in 1984 in Akron, Ohio, became a locally known basketball prodigy while in elementary school. James led Akron‚Äôs St. Vincent‚ÄìSt. Mary High School to three state championships in four years. He was named Ohio‚Äôs Mr. Basketball‚Äîthe high-school player of the year‚Äîthree times during 2001‚Äì03. LeBron James was selected first overall in the 2003 National Basketball Association draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers. He played for the Cavaliers through the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season. He then signed with the Miami Heat but returned to the Cavaliers in 2014. James joined the Los Angeles Lakers in 2018. He won NBA championships with all three teams.

LeBron James (born December 30, 1984, Akron, Ohio, U.S.) is an American professional basketball player who is widely considered one of the greatest all-around players of all time and who won National Basketball Association (NBA) championships with the Miami Heat (2012 and 2013), the Cleveland Cavaliers (2016), and the Los Angeles Lakers (2020). In 2023 he became the NBA‚Äôs all-time leading scorer, breaking the record (38,387) previously held by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. His dominance continued when in 2024, he recorded his 40,000 point scored. Find out where he ranks in our list of the greatest basketball players. A locally known basketball prodigy since elementary school, James was named Ohio‚Äôs Mr. Basketball (high-school player of the year) three times while leading Akron‚Äôs St. Vincent‚ÄìSt. Mary High School to three Ohio state championships in his four years on the team. He became a national media sensation in his junior year after appearing on the cover of Sports Illustrated, where he was billed by the magazine as ‚ÄúThe Chosen One.‚Äù James was the consensus national high-school player of the year in his senior season, and he was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall selection of the 2003 NBA draft. Additionally, he signed an unprecedented $90 million endorsement contract with the Nike shoe company before he ever played a professional game. Despite the pressures brought on by these singular circumstances, James led the Cavaliers in scoring, steals, and minutes played over the course of the 2003‚Äì04 season, winning the league‚Äôs Rookie of the Year award in the process. A 6-foot 9-inch (2.06-meter) ‚Äúpoint forward‚Äù who was as adept at bringing the ball down the court as at playing near the basket, James presented a unique challenge for opposing teams; his unmatched athleticism and well-muscled body would not have been out of place in the National Football League. His game progressed over the following years. He was voted one of the starting forwards on the Eastern Conference All-Star team during his second season, and in his third season he led the Cavaliers to their first playoff berth in nine years. These accomplishments were exceeded during the 2006‚Äì07 season, when James guided Cleveland to the franchise‚Äôs first berth in the NBA finals. After the Cavaliers upset the favored Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference finals, the Cavaliers were swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the NBA finals, but James‚Äôs impressive postseason play led many observers to place him among the very best players in the league. He led the NBA in scoring during the 2007‚Äì08 season and earned first team All-NBA honors, but the Cavaliers lost to the eventual champion Boston Celtics in a dramatic seven-game series in the Eastern Conference semifinals. James piloted the Cavaliers to a team-record 66 wins during the 2008‚Äì09 season, which helped to earn him the league‚Äôs Most Valuable Player (MVP) award. The following season James averaged nearly 30 points per game as he was again named MVP. At the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season, James became arguably the most sought-after free agent in NBA history when his contract with the Cavaliers expired, and he began a prolonged courtship process with a number of teams that had in some cases been planning for his free agency for over two years. In an unprecedented hour-long television special, criticized by many for its undue grandiosity, James announced that he was signing with the Heat. He helped Miami reach the NBA finals in his first year with the team, but the Heat lost the championship to the Dallas Mavericks. In the 2011‚Äì12 season James averaged 27.1 points per game and won his third MVP award while helping Miami advance to its second consecutive NBA finals appearance. Backed by his stellar play‚ÄîJames was named the finals MVP‚Äîthe Heat defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder to win the championship. He had arguably his greatest individual season in 2012‚Äì13, as he averaged 26.8 points, 7.3 assists, and a career-high 8.0 rebounds per game while posting a .565 field-goal percentage, a remarkable rate of made shots for someone who so frequently played away from the basket. James also helped Miami win 27 consecutive games that season (the second longest such streak in NBA history), and he was rewarded with his fourth league MVP award. In the following postseason, the Heat defeated the San Antonio Spurs in a seven-game series to win the NBA championship, and James was again named the finals MVP. He continued his stellar play in the following season, even increasing his shooting percentage by .002, and he again led the Heat to an appearance in the NBA finals. However, Miami lost that rematch with the Spurs in a five-game series. After that finals loss, James opted out of his contract with the Heat, leaving an aging Miami roster, and‚Äîafter a week of frenzied speculation among fans and media‚Äîhe decided to return to Cleveland. Although his 25.3 points per game was James‚Äôs lowest scoring average since his rookie season, he nevertheless guided a young and inexperienced Cavaliers roster to the second best record in the Eastern Conference in 2014‚Äì15. In the following postseason he led an injury-laden Cleveland team to just two playoff losses en route to a berth in the NBA finals. There James had one of the greatest individual performances in finals history, averaging 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game while leading the undermanned Cavaliers to the franchise‚Äôs first two finals victories before ultimately losing a six-game series to the Golden State Warriors. James had another strong regular season in 2015‚Äì16 but, once again, truly shined in the playoffs. He led the Cavaliers to a rematch against the Warriors, who had set a league record with 73 wins during the regular season, in the NBA finals. There the Cavaliers became the first team to come back from a 3‚Äì1 finals deficit to capture the first title in franchise history and end a 52-year title drought for Cleveland professional sports teams. James averaged 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.6 steals, and 2.3 blocks per game in the finals‚Äîbecoming the first person to lead all five statistical categories for players on both teams in the finals‚Äîand was unanimously named finals MVP. In 2016‚Äì17 James had arguably his best regular season by setting career highs with averages of 8.7 assists and 8.6 rebounds per game while still scoring 26.4 points per game. He sustained his excellence in the Eastern Conference playoffs, scoring 32.5 points per game (which included his 5,988th career postseason point, breaking Michael Jordan‚Äôs all-time NBA playoff scoring record) while leading the Cavaliers to a third consecutive match-up against the Warriors in the NBA finals. There Cleveland could not overcome the team James referred to as a ‚Äújuggernaut,‚Äù losing to the Warriors in five games despite James becoming the first player in NBA history to average a triple-double over the course of the finals (with 33.6 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists per game). In 2017‚Äì18 he played a full 82-game regular season for the first time in his career and led the NBA in minutes played per game (36.9) while averaging 27.5 points, 8.6 rebounds, and a new career-high 9.1 assists per game. James again excelled in the following playoffs, scoring more than 40 points seven times in the team‚Äôs 18 Eastern Conference postseason games (which included two seven-game series) to lead the Cavaliers to their fourth straight NBA finals series against the Warriors. He continued his strong individual play in the finals, but it was not enough to overcome Golden State‚Äôs overwhelming talent advantage, and the Warriors swept the series. In the following off-season, James, a free agent, joined the Los Angeles Lakers. He continued to play at a high level, averaging 27.4 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 8.3 assists per game, but he missed significant playing time because of an injury (a strained groin) for the first time in his career. The Lakers struggled in his absence and ultimately finished the 2018‚Äì19 season with a 37‚Äì45 record, ending James‚Äôs personal playoff streak at 13 seasons. The following season was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused a four-month suspension. Play resumed in July 2020 with a shortened schedule, and the Lakers ultimately defeated the Miami Heat to claim the franchise‚Äôs 17th NBA title. James‚Äôs dominating performance‚Äîhe averaged 29.8 points, 11.8 rebounds, and 8.5 assists per game‚Äîearned him his fourth finals MVP award. In addition to his achievements in the NBA, James was a member of the U.S. men‚Äôs Olympic basketball teams that won the bronze medal at the 2004 Games, the gold medal at the 2008 Games, and the gold at the 2012 Games. James did not return to Olympic competition until the 2024 Paris Games, and there he led the U.S. team to a fifth consecutive gold medal and was named the tournament‚Äôs MVP. Off the court, James occasionally acted, notably appearing as himself in Judd Apatow‚Äôs comedy Trainwreck (2015). In 2021 he appeared in the live-action/animated Space Jam: A New Legacy. James also published a memoir, Shooting Stars (2009; cowritten with Buzz Bissinger), that chronicles his years as a high-school standout.",

James first garnered national attention as the top high school basketball player in the country before being drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2003. With his unique combination of size, athleticism, and court vision, he became a four-time NBA MVP. After leading the Miami Heat to titles in 2012 and 2013, James returned to the Cavaliers and helped the franchise claim its first championship in 2016. Since joining Los Angeles in 2018, he has won an additional NBA championship and became the all-time leading scorer in league history. FULL NAME: LeBron Raymone JamesBORN: December 30, 1984BIRTHPLACE: Akron, OhioSPOUSE: Savannah James (2013-present)CHILDREN: LeBron Jr., Bryce, and ZhuriASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Capricorn LeBron Raymone James was born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio. At an early age, he showed a natural talent for basketball. James was recruited by St. Vincent-St. Mary High School to join their basketball team in 1999. As a freshman, James averaged 18 points per game. He helped the team to a Division III state title by scoring 25 points in the championship game. Word of his advanced basketball skills spread, and James received several honors for his performance. As a high school sophomore, James was chosen for the USA Today All-USA First Team. He was the first sophomore ever selected for this award. His team also won the Division III state title for the second year in a row. The following school year, James was named Parade magazine‚Äôs High School Boys Basketball Player of the Year and Gatorade Player of the Year. Following the end of his junior year, James was such a strong player that he contemplated going pro. Deciding to finish his education, James had a tremendous senior year on the court. He averaged 31.6 points per game, helping his team clinch their third state title. The St. Vincent-St. Mary High School team also earned the top national ranking that year. Throughout his high school playing career, James totaled 2,657 points, 892 rebounds, and 523 assists. He would soon emerged as one of the NBA‚Äôs leading players. With his impressive record, it was no surprise that James was the first player picked in the 2003 NBA Draft straight out of high school. The Cleveland Cavaliers signed the powerful young forward, and he proved to be a valuable addition to the then-struggling franchise. The team had ended the previous season in eighth place in the Eastern Conference. During the 2003-04 season, James made history when he became the first member of the Cavalier franchise to win the NBA Rookie of the Year Award. At only 20 years old, he also became the youngest player to receive this honor. Additionally, James averaged 20 points per game at this time and became one of only three rookies to accomplish this feat, putting him in the same company as Michael Jordan and Oscar Robertson. James continued to excel professionally in the NBA the following season, upping his average points per game to 27.2. He made NBA history again in 2005 when he became the youngest player to score more than 50 points in one game. In 2006, James helped the Cleveland Cavaliers defeat the Washington Wizards in the first round of playoff action. From there, his team took on the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference semifinals. James scored an average of 26.6 per game in this postseason matchup, but it wasn‚Äôt enough to secure victory. While the Cavaliers weren‚Äôt at the top of the rankings, James continued to receive special recognition for his individual abilities. Also that year, James reached a new contract agreement with the Cavaliers. The team proved to be stronger competitors the following season, defeating Detroit to win the Eastern Conference. In the NBA Finals against the San Antonio Spurs, however, the Cavaliers lost their championship bid in four consecutive games. During the 2007-08 season, James continued to help the Cavaliers improve their standing in the Eastern Conference. The team made it to the semifinals, where they were defeated by the Boston Celtics in seven games. In terms of individual performance, James had a stellar year, outperforming such rival players as Kobe Bryant and Allen Iverson, by scoring an average of 30 points per game, the highest average in the NBA regular season. Early in the 2008-09 season, sports journalists and fans began talking about James‚Äô future in the sport. He had the option to become a free agent in 2010, and there was much discussion as to where James would end up. Some journalists identified the New York Knicks as a potential suitor for the rising player. James made several references to his impending free-agent status, but he was sure to downplay the matter. ‚ÄúI am focused on the team that I am on right now and winning a championship... I don‚Äôt think about making a change at this point,‚Äù James told reporters. Shortly after becoming a free agent, James announced that he would be joining the Miami Heat for the 2010-11 season. His fans in Cleveland were less than pleased, and many considered his departure a betrayal to his hometown. Soon after James‚Äô announcement, Cleveland Cavaliers majority owner Dan Gilbert wrote an open letter declaring James‚Äô decision as ‚Äúselfish,‚Äù ‚Äúheartless‚Äù and a ‚Äúcowardly betrayal.‚Äù Unfazed, James finished second in the league during his first season with the Heat, scoring 26.7 points per game. The 2011-12 season saw major success for James and the Miami Heat. With his team‚Äôs victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder in the NBA Finals, the superstar forward finally earned his first title. In the clinching Game 5, James scored 26 points and had 11 rebounds and 13 assists. ‚ÄúI made a difficult decision to leave Cleveland, but I understood what my future was about,‚Äù James told Fox Sports following the game. ‚ÄúI knew we had a bright future [in Miami].‚Äù During the 2012-13 season, James made NBA history yet again: On January 16, 2013, at age 28, he became the youngest player to score 20,000 points, succeeding Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers‚Äîwho accomplished this feat when he was 29‚Äîand becoming only the 38th player in NBA history to achieve this distinction. James made a jump shot the final seconds of the game, bringing his scoring total 20,001 and leading the Heat to a 92-75 victory over the Golden State Warriors. Success followed the Heat to the end of the 2012-13 season: Following a hard-fought, six-game series against the Indiana Pacers to win the Eastern Conference, Miami outlasted the San Antonio Spurs in seven games to win its second consecutive NBA championship. At the culmination of the 2013-14 season, Miami returned to the NBA Finals to face off against the Spurs again, this time losing to San Antonio after five games. In July 2014, after opting out of his contract with the Heat and considering other teams, James announced that he was returning to the Cavaliers. Hampered by back and knee problems, James missed 13 of 82 regular-season games in 2014-15. However, he was as dominant as ever when healthy, averaging 25.3 points and 7.4 assists per game. James led the Cavaliers to the NBA Finals, becoming the first player in nearly 50 years to reach the championship round in five consecutive seasons. However, injuries to star teammates Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving damaged his hopes of claiming a third title, and the Cavaliers lost to the Golden State Warriors in six games. Over the course of 2015-16, the Cavs overcame the distraction of a mid-season coaching change and breezed through the playoffs to earn a rematch with the Warriors, marking the sixth straight NBA Finals appearance for ‚ÄúKing James.‚Äù In perhaps the crowning achievement of his career, he led his team back from a 3-1 deficit, scoring 41 points in both Games 5 and 6, before recording a triple-double in Game 7 to give the Cavs their first championship in franchise history. Voted Finals MVP, James said: ‚ÄúI came back to bring a championship to our city. I knew what I was capable of doing. I knew what I learned in the last couple years that I was gone, and I knew if I had to‚Äîwhen I came back‚ÄîI knew I had the right ingredients and the right blueprint to help this franchise get back to a place that we‚Äôve never been. That‚Äôs what it was all about.‚Äù The following year, James again paced himself and took charge when necessary, driving the Cavs through the Eastern Conference to make an incredible seventh consecutive appearance in the NBA Finals. This time, with former MVP Kevin Durant added to the mix, the Warriors proved too formidable for James and his teammates, who lost the championship in five games. For all his accomplishments, James achieved another first early in the 2017-18 NBA season: After yelling at a referee during a late November win over the Heat, he was ejected for the first time in 1,082 career games. The superstar likely felt like yelling often during the course of a frustrating campaign, as an offseason trade that sent Irving to Boston for Isaiah Thomas failed to bear fruit and forced the Cavs to make another major deal before the All-Star break. After averaging a career-best 9.1 assists in the regular season, James had to dig deep just to get the team out of the first round of the playoffs, delivering a brilliant 45-point effort to sink the Pacers in Game 7. The Cavs were again pushed to the limit two rounds later by the scrappy Boston Celtics, but James scored 81 points over the last two games to pull out the series win and make his eighth straight NBA Finals appearance. Game 1 of the rematch against Golden State went down to the wire, thanks to James‚Äô 51-point outburst, but Cleveland guard J.R. Smith inexplicably dribbled out the clock with the game tied in regulation before the Warriors pulled away for the win in overtime. That represented the Cavs‚Äô best chance to get a leg up on their opponents, as the Warriors won the next three games handily to claim their third title in four years. Afterward, with questions swirling about his future with the team, James revealed that he had played out the series with a broken right hand after punching a whiteboard in the aftermath of the Game 1 loss. On July 1, 2018, James announced that he was moving on to the next chapter of his career by signing a four-year, $153.3 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers, a storied franchise that counted Kobe Bryant, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Magic Johnson among its all-time greats. The good vibes had worn off by midseason, as the Lakers sputtered through a 17-game stretch without their injured star. With the team still struggling in late February 2019, James accused his teammates of losing focus over trade rumors, saying, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre still allowing distractions to affect the way you play, this is the wrong franchise to be a part of and you should just come in and be like, ‚ÄòListen, I can‚Äôt do this.‚Äô‚Äù When the Lakers were officially eliminated from playoff contention in March 2019, it snapped James‚Äô personal marks of 13 consecutive postseasons and eight straight NBA Finals appearances. Capping a difficult first season in Los Angeles, the Lakers announced that their star would miss the final six games because of his lingering groin injury. Things got off to a much better start the following season, thanks in large part to the addition of athletic big man Anthony Davis to the roster. Spearheading the Lakers‚Äô rise to the top of the standings was James, who became the first player to record a triple-double against all 30 NBA teams in November 2019. The following month, James added another accolade to his ever-growing list by earning AP Male Athlete of the Decade honors. James won his fourth championship in 2020, when the Lakers defeated the Miami Heat in a special playoff tournament held at the Walt Disney World resort following the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. James was selected for the NBA All-Star Game for the first time in 2005 and has earned a spot in the annual showcase in each of the next 19 seasons‚Äîan NBA record streak. In January 2018, the league announced James and Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry had topped the ballots and would serve as captains for that year‚Äôs All-Star Game. In 2006, James was named MVP in the NBA All-Star Game, a feat he repeated in 2008 and 2018. James has also been named NBA MVP in four seasons: 2008-09, 2009-10, 2011-12, and 2012-13. In January 2018, at age 33, James surpassed Kobe Bryant as the youngest player to accumulate 30,000 career points and became the seventh player in NBA history to achieve that milestone. The feat put him just more than 8,000 points shy of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar‚Äôs all-time record of 38,387 points. James continued to surpass other legends in ensuing seasons, topping Michael Jordan‚Äôs career tally of 32,292 points in 2019 to move into fourth place all-time. In January 2020, he eclipsed Bryant‚Äôs total of 33,643 points to move into third place, one night before his predecessor‚Äôs shocking death in a helicopter accident. Then, on February 7, 2023, James scored 38 points in a loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder‚Äîsetting the all-time mark with Abdul-Jabbar sitting courtside. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt set this as a goal, so that‚Äôs probably why it‚Äôs so surreal and so weird to me,‚Äù James said. ‚ÄúI never talked about being the all-time scorer in NBA history‚Ä¶ until my numbers started getting closer and closer, and I was like, ‚ÄòOh wow, this is crazy. This is weird, but I guess I‚Äôm doing it.‚Äô‚Äù As of July 2024, James is also fourth in league history in assists (11,009) and eighth in steals (2,275). After 21 NBA seasons, James‚Äô stats include regular season per-game averages of: James has competed on the U.S. Olympic basketball team during four Summer Olympic Games: in 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2024. He made his Olympic debut at the 2004 Summer Games in Athens, Greece. He and his teammates won bronze medals after defeating Lithuania. Argentina took home the gold after beating Italy in the finals. In the summer of 2008, James traveled to Beijing to play with the likes of Kobe Bryant, Jason Kidd, and Dwyane Wade on Team USA. This time around the Americans brought home the gold after defeating Spain in the final round. James competed at his third Olympic Games in 2012, at the Summer Olympics in London, along with Kevin Durant, Bryant, Carmelo Anthony, and several other top players. The U.S. basketball team took the gold medal again, marking James‚Äô second consecutive Olympic gold. After sitting out the 2016 and 2020 Games, James is competing for his third gold medal at the Paris Olympics this year. He was also selected to serve as the male flag bearer for the entire U.S. delegation at the opening ceremony. As of July 2024, Celebrity Net Worth estimates James‚Äô total fortune at around $800 million. According to ESPN, he is currently the sixth-highest paid player in the NBA, earning just under $50 million for the upcoming season. James‚Äô fortune largely stems from his playing salary and a series of lucrative endorsements. The NBA superstar previously signed a four-year, $153.3 million contract with the Lakers in July 2018. Off the court, James has inked several partnerships since turning pro, including a deal with Nike for $90 million that could net him over $1 billion over his lifetime. Some of his other endorsements have included Intel, Verizon, Coca-Cola, Beats by Dre, and Kia Motors. James is also an investor in Blaze Pizza. On January 1, 2012, James proposed to his high school sweetheart, Savannah Brinson. The couple married in a private ceremony with about 200 guests in San Diego on September 14, 2013. LeBron and Savannah have two sons and one daughter together. In October 2004, they welcomed their first son, LeBron Jr., nicknamed ‚ÄúBronny.‚Äù On June 14, 2007, Savannah gave birth to their second son, Bryce. Their daughter, Zhuri, was born on October 22, 2014. Like his father, Bronny became a basketball phenom as a teenager and one of the most sought-after recruits in the country while attending the Sierra Canyon School. He played collegiately at the University of Southern California during the 2023-24 season before entering the NBA draft. The Lakers selected Bronny with the 55th overall pick, pairing him with his father in Los Angeles. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to hold him accountable, and he should hold me accountable when I do things not right. I can separate dad from teammate,‚Äù LeBron told Today. ‚ÄúAnd, I think, as he continues to grow, and as he continues to learn, I hope he‚Äôs able to separate son from teammate, as well.‚Äù Outside of the NBA, James has worked to help others. He established the LeBron James Family Foundation in 2004, along with his mother, Gloria, to help out children and single-parent families in need. Among its many programs, the organization builds playgrounds in economically disadvantaged areas and hosts an annual bike-a-thon. One of the world‚Äôs most recognizable athletes, James hasn‚Äôt been shy about expressing his views on social media. Among other issues, he displayed his support for Trayvon Martin after the teen‚Äôs death in 2012, and he has clashed with President Donald Trump. James waded into delicate territory in October 2019, after Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey posted a tweet in support of Hong Kong‚Äôs pro-democracy protesters that ignited a Chinese media boycott of NBA preseason games in the country. James said he believed Morey was ‚Äúmisinformed‚Äù about the situation, though he later tweeted that he mainly took issue with the executive posting comments that could have exposed traveling players to danger. The basketball superstar has also shown a playful side on social media, such as when he posted a picture of cartoon character Arthur clenching his first during the Cavaliers‚Äô slow start to the 2017-18 season. Like many pro athletes before him, James parlayed his popularity into opportunities on the big and small screen. On television, James has had guest roles on the popular cartoons The Simpsons (2005), SpongeBob SquarePants (2009), and The Cleveland Show (2011), and appeared as himself on the HBO drama Entourage in 2009. James made his major movie with a supporting role in 2015‚Äôs Trainwreck, a comedy starring Amy Schumer and Bill Hader. He later starred in Space Jam 2, the 2021 sequel to the hit 1996 live-action and cartoon hybrid starring Michael Jordan. ‚ÄúThe Space Jam collaboration is so much more than just me and the Looney Tunes getting together and doing this movie,‚Äù James told The Hollywood Reporter. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so much bigger. I‚Äôd just love for kids to understand how empowered they can feel and how empowered they can be if they don‚Äôt just give up on their dreams.‚Äù In 2020, the basketball great co-founded a production company called SpringHill Entertainment.

                "content": "Manchester United Football Club, commonly referred to as Man United (often stylised as Man Utd) or simply United, is a professional football club based in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, England. They compete in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. Nicknamed the Red Devils, they were founded as Newton Heath LYR Football Club in 1878, but changed their name to Manchester United in 1902. After a spell playing in Clayton, Manchester, the club moved to their current stadium, Old Trafford, in 1910. Domestically, Manchester United have won a record 20 top-flight league titles, 13 FA Cups, 6 League Cups and a record 21 FA Community Shields. Additionally, in international football, they have won the European Cup/UEFA Champions League three times, and the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, the UEFA Super Cup, the Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup once each.[7][8] Appointed as manager in 1945, Matt Busby built a team with an average age of just 22 nicknamed the Busby Babes that won successive league titles in the 1950s and became the first English club to compete in the European Cup. Eight players were killed in the Munich air disaster, but Busby rebuilt the team around star players George Best, Denis Law and Bobby Charlton ‚Äì known as the United Trinity. They won two more league titles before becoming the first English club to win the European Cup in 1968. After Busby's retirement, Manchester United were unable to produce sustained success until the arrival of Alex Ferguson, who became the club's longest-serving and most successful manager, winning 38 trophies including 13 league titles, five FA Cups and two Champions League titles between 1986 and 2013.[9] In the 1998‚Äì99 season, under Ferguson, the club became the first in the history of English football to achieve the continental treble of the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League.[10] In winning the UEFA Europa League under Jos√© Mourinho in 2016‚Äì17, they became one of five clubs to have won the original three main UEFA club competitions (the Champions League, Europa League and Cup Winners' Cup). Manchester United are one of the most widely supported football clubs in the world[11][12] and have rivalries with Liverpool, Manchester City, Arsenal and Leeds United. Manchester United were the highest-earning football club in the world for 2016‚Äì17, with an annual revenue of ‚Ç¨676.3 million,[13] and the world's third-most-valuable football club in 2019, valued at ¬£3.15 billion ($3.81 billion).[14] After being floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club was taken private in 2005 after a purchase by American businessman Malcolm Glazer valued at almost ¬£800 million, of which over ¬£500 million of borrowed money became the club's debt.[15] From 2012, some shares of the club were listed on the New York Stock Exchange, although the Glazer family retains overall ownership and control of the club. Manchester United were formed in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football Club by the Carriage and Wagon department of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) depot at Newton Heath.[16] The team initially played games against other departments and railway companies, but on 20 November 1880, they competed in their first recorded match; wearing the colours of the railway company ‚Äì green and gold ‚Äì they were defeated 6‚Äì0 by Bolton Wanderers' reserve team.[17] By 1888, the club had become a founding member of The Combination, a regional football league. Following the league's dissolution after only one season, Newton Heath joined the newly formed Football Alliance, which ran for three seasons before being merged with The Football League. This resulted in the club starting the 1892‚Äì93 season in the First Division, by which time it had become independent of the railway company and dropped the \"LYR\" from its name.[16] After two seasons, the club was relegated to the Second Division.[16] In January 1902, with debts of ¬£2,670 ‚Äì equivalent to ¬£370,000 in 2024[nb 1] ‚Äì the club was served with a winding-up order.[18] Captain Harry Stafford found four local businessmen, including John Henry Davies (who became club president), each willing to invest ¬£500 in return for a direct interest in running the club and who subsequently changed the name;[19] on 24 April 1902, Manchester United was officially born.[20][nb 2] Under Ernest Mangnall, who assumed managerial duties in 1903, Manchester United finished as Second Division runners-up in 1906 and secured promotion to the First Division, which they won in 1908 ‚Äì the club's first league title. The following season began with victory in the first ever Charity Shield[21] and ended with the club's first FA Cup title. Mangnall was considered a significant influence behind the team's move to Old Trafford in 1910, and Manchester United won the First Division for the second time in 1911.[22] At the end of the following season, however, Mangnall left the club to join Manchester City.[23] In 1922, three years after the resumption of football following the First World War, the club was relegated to the Second Division, where it remained until regaining promotion in 1925. Relegated again in 1931, Manchester United became a yo-yo club, achieving its all-time lowest position of 20th place in the Second Division in 1934, under secretary-manager Scott Duncan, narrowly avoiding relegation to the Third Division. Two years later, Duncan led the club to promotion before another relegation followed in 1937, which led to his resignation in November of that year. Following the death of principal benefactor John Henry Davies in October 1927, the club's finances deteriorated to the extent that Manchester United would likely have gone bankrupt had it not been for James W. Gibson, who, in December 1931, invested ¬£2,000 and assumed control of the club.[24] In the 1938‚Äì39 season, the last year of football before the Second World War, the club finished 14th in the First Division.[24] In October 1945, the impending resumption of football after the war led to the managerial appointment of Matt Busby, who demanded an unprecedented level of control over team selection, player transfers and training sessions.[25] Busby led the team to second-place league finishes in 1947, 1948 and 1949, and to FA Cup victory in 1948. In 1952, the club won the First Division, its first league title for 41 years.[26] They then won back-to-back league titles in 1956 and 1957; the squad, who had an average age of 22, were nicknamed \"the Busby Babes\" by the media, a testament to Busby's faith in his youth players.[27] In 1957, Manchester United became the first English team to compete in the European Cup, despite objections from The Football League, who had denied Chelsea the same opportunity the previous season.[28] En route to the semi-final, which they lost to Real Madrid, the team recorded a 10‚Äì0 victory over Belgian champions Anderlecht, which remains the club's biggest victory on record.[29] The following season, on the way home from a European Cup quarter-final victory against Red Star Belgrade, the aircraft carrying the Manchester United players, officials and journalists crashed while attempting to take off after refuelling in Munich, Germany. The Munich air disaster of 6 February 1958 claimed 23 lives, including those of eight players ‚Äì Geoff Bent, Roger Byrne, Eddie Colman, Duncan Edwards, Mark Jones, David Pegg, Tommy Taylor and Billy Whelan ‚Äì and injured several more.[30][31] Assistant manager Jimmy Murphy took over as manager while Busby recovered from his injuries and the club's makeshift side reached the FA Cup final, which they lost to Bolton Wanderers. In recognition of the team's tragedy, UEFA invited the club to compete in the 1958‚Äì59 European Cup alongside eventual League champions Wolverhampton Wanderers. Despite approval from The Football Association, The Football League determined that the club should not enter the competition, since it had not qualified.[32][33] Busby rebuilt the team through the 1960s by signing players such as Denis Law and Pat Crerand, who combined with the next generation of youth players ‚Äì including George Best ‚Äì to win the FA Cup in 1963. Busby rested several key players for the League game before the Cup Final which gave Dennis Walker the chance to make his debut against Nottingham Forest on 20 May. Walker thus became the first Black player to represent United.[34] The following season, they finished second in the league, then won the title in 1965 and 1967. In 1968, Manchester United became the first English club to win the European Cup, beating Benfica 4‚Äì1 in the final[35] with a team that contained three European Footballers of the Year: Bobby Charlton, Denis Law and George Best.[36] They then represented Europe in the 1968 Intercontinental Cup against Estudiantes of Argentina, but defeat in the first leg in Buenos Aires meant a 1‚Äì1 draw at Old Trafford three weeks later was not enough to claim the title. Busby resigned as manager in 1969 before being replaced by the reserve team coach, former Manchester United player Wilf McGuinness.[37] Following an eighth-place finish in the 1969‚Äì70 season and a poor start to the 1970‚Äì71 season, Busby was persuaded to temporarily resume managerial duties, and McGuinness returned to his position as reserve team coach. In June 1971, Frank O'Farrell was appointed as manager, but lasted less than 18 months before being replaced by Tommy Docherty in December 1972.[39] Docherty saved Manchester United from relegation that season, only to see them relegated in 1974; by that time the trio of Best, Law, and Charlton had left the club.[35] The team won promotion at the first attempt and reached the FA Cup final in 1976, but were beaten by Southampton. They reached the final again in 1977, beating Liverpool 2‚Äì1. Docherty was dismissed shortly afterwards, following the revelation of his affair with the club physiotherapist's wife.[37][40] Dave Sexton replaced Docherty as manager in the summer of 1977. Despite major signings, including Joe Jordan, Gordon McQueen, Gary Bailey, and Ray Wilkins, the team failed to win any trophies; they finished second in 1979‚Äì80 and lost to Arsenal in the 1979 FA Cup final. Sexton was dismissed in 1981, even though the team won the last seven games under his direction.[41] He was replaced by Ron Atkinson, who immediately broke the British record transfer fee to sign Bryan Robson from his former club West Bromwich Albion. Under Atkinson, Manchester United won the FA Cup in 1983 and 1985 and beat rivals Liverpool to win the 1983 Charity Shield. In 1985‚Äì86, after 13 wins and two draws in its first 15 matches, the club was favourite to win the league but finished in fourth place. The following season, with the club in danger of relegation by November, Atkinson was dismissed.[42] Alex Ferguson and his assistant Archie Knox arrived from Aberdeen on the day of Atkinson's dismissal,[43] and guided the club to an 11th-place finish in the league.[44] Despite a second-place finish in 1987‚Äì88, the club was back in 11th place the following season.[45] Reportedly on the verge of being dismissed, Ferguson's job was saved by victory over Crystal Palace in the 1990 FA Cup final.[46][47] The following season, Manchester United claimed their first UEFA Cup Winners' Cup title. That triumph allowed the club to compete in the European Super Cup for the first time, where United beat European Cup holders Red Star Belgrade 1‚Äì0 at Old Trafford. The club appeared in two consecutive League Cup finals in 1991 and 1992, beating Nottingham Forest 1‚Äì0 in the second to win that competition for the first time as well.[42] In 1993, in the first season of the newly founded Premier League, the club won their first league title since 1967, and a year later, for the first time since 1957, they won a second consecutive title ‚Äì alongside the FA Cup ‚Äì to complete the first \"Double\" in the club's history.[42] United then became the first English club to do the Double twice when they won both competitions again in 1995‚Äì96,[48] before retaining the league title once more in 1996‚Äì97 with a game to spare.[49] In the 1998‚Äì99 season, Manchester United became the first team to win the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League ‚Äì \"The Treble\" ‚Äì in the same season.[50] Trailing 1‚Äì0 going into injury time in the 1999 UEFA Champions League final, Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskj√¶r scored late goals to claim a dramatic victory over Bayern Munich, in what is considered one of the greatest comebacks of all time.[51] That summer, Ferguson received a knighthood for his services to football.[52] In November 1999, the club became the only British team to ever win the Intercontinental Cup with a 1‚Äì0 victory over the strong 1999 Copa Libertadores winners Palmeiras in Tokyo. The Red Devils counted on an unexpected goalkeeper fail by future 2002 FIFA World Cup winner Marcos and a disallowed goal scored by Alex to win the game.[53] Manchester United won the league again in the 1999‚Äì2000 and 2000‚Äì01 seasons, becoming only the fourth club to win the English title three times in a row. The team finished third in 2001‚Äì02, before regaining the title in 2002‚Äì03.[55] They won the 2003‚Äì04 FA Cup, beating Millwall 3‚Äì0 in the final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff to lift the trophy for a record 11th time.[56] In the 2005‚Äì06 season, Manchester United failed to qualify for the knockout phase of the UEFA Champions League for the first time in over a decade,[57] but recovered to secure a second-place league finish and victory over Wigan Athletic in the 2006 Football League Cup final. The club regained the Premier League title in the 2006‚Äì07 season, before completing the European double in 2007‚Äì08 with a 6‚Äì5 penalty shoot-out victory over Chelsea in the 2008 UEFA Champions League final in Moscow to go with their 17th English league title. Ryan Giggs made a record 759th appearance for the club in that game, overtaking previous record holder Bobby Charlton.[58] In December 2008, the club became the first British team to win the FIFA Club World Cup after beating LDU Quito 1‚Äì0 in the final. Manchester United followed this with the 2008‚Äì09 Football League Cup, and its third successive Premier League title.[59][60] That summer, forward Cristiano Ronaldo was sold to Real Madrid for a world record ¬£80 million.[61] In 2010, Manchester United defeated Aston Villa 2‚Äì1 at Wembley to retain the League Cup, its first successful defence of a knockout cup competition.[62] After finishing as runners-up to Chelsea in the 2009‚Äì10 season, United achieved a record 19th league title in 2010‚Äì11, securing the championship with a 1‚Äì1 away draw against Blackburn Rovers on 14 May 2011.[63] This was extended to 20 league titles in 2012‚Äì13, securing the championship with a 3‚Äì0 home win against Aston Villa on 22 April 2013.[64] On 8 May 2013, Ferguson announced that he was to retire as manager at the end of the football season, but would remain at the club as a director and club ambassador.[65][66] He retired as the most decorated manager in football history.[67][68] The club announced the next day that Everton manager David Moyes would replace him from 1 July, having signed a six-year contract.[69][70][71] Ryan Giggs took over as interim player-manager 10 months later, on 22 April 2014, when Moyes was sacked after a poor season in which the club failed to defend their Premier League title and failed to qualify for the UEFA Champions League for the first time since 1995‚Äì96.[72] They also failed to qualify for the UEFA Europa League, the first time Manchester United had not qualified for a European competition since 1990.[73] On 19 May 2014, it was confirmed that Louis van Gaal would replace Moyes as Manchester United manager on a three-year deal, with Giggs as his assistant.[74] Malcolm Glazer, the patriarch of the family that owns the club, died on 28 May 2014.[75] Under Van Gaal, United won a 12th FA Cup, but a disappointing slump in the middle of his second season led to rumours of the board sounding out potential replacements.[76] Van Gaal was ultimately sacked just two days after the cup final victory, with United having finished fifth in the league.[77] Former Porto, Chelsea, Inter Milan and Real Madrid manager Jos√© Mourinho was appointed in his place on 27 May 2016.[78] Mourinho signed a three-year contract, and in his first season won the FA Community Shield, EFL Cup and UEFA Europa League. Wayne Rooney scored his 250th goal for United, a stoppage-time equaliser in a league game against Stoke City in January 2017, surpassing Sir Bobby Charlton as the club's all-time top scorer.[79] The following season, United finished second in the league ‚Äì their highest league placing since 2013 ‚Äì but were still 19 points behind rivals Manchester City. Mourinho also guided the club to a 19th FA Cup final, but they lost 1‚Äì0 to Chelsea. On 18 December 2018, with United in sixth place in the Premier League table, 19 points behind leaders Liverpool and 11 points outside the Champions League places, Mourinho was sacked after 144 games in charge. The following day, former United striker Ole Gunnar Solskj√¶r was appointed as caretaker manager until the end of the season.[80] On 28 March 2019, after winning 14 of his first 19 matches in charge, Solskj√¶r was appointed permanent manager on a three-year deal.[81] On 18 April 2021, Manchester United announced they were joining 11 other European clubs as founding members of the European Super League, a proposed 20-team competition intended to rival the UEFA Champions League.[82] The announcement drew a significant backlash from supporters, other clubs, media partners, sponsors, players and the UK Government, forcing the club to withdraw just two days later.[83][84][85][86][87] The failure of the project led to the resignation of executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, while resultant protests against Woodward and the Glazer family led to a pitch invasion ahead of a league match against Liverpool on 2 May 2021, which saw the first postponement of a Premier League game due to supporter protests in the competition's history.[88][89] On the pitch, United equalled their own record for the biggest win in Premier League history with a 9‚Äì0 win over Southampton on 2 February 2021,[90] but ended the season with defeat on penalties in the UEFA Europa League final against Villarreal, going four straight seasons without a trophy.[91] On 20 November 2021, Solskj√¶r left his role as manager.[92] Former midfielder Michael Carrick took charge for the next three games, before the appointment of Ralf Rangnick as interim manager until the end of the season.[93] On 21 April 2022, Erik ten Hag was appointed as the manager from the end of the 2021‚Äì22 season, signing a contract until June 2025 with the option of extending for a further year.[94] Under Ten Hag, Manchester United won the 2022‚Äì23 EFL Cup, defeating Newcastle United in the final to end their longest period without a trophy since a six-year span between 1977 and 1983.[95][96] On 5 March 2023, the club suffered their joint-heaviest defeat, losing 7‚Äì0 to rivals Liverpool at Anfield.[97] At the end of the following season, the club finished eighth in the Premier League, their lowest league finish since the 1989‚Äì90 season, but went on to beat cross-city rivals Manchester City 2‚Äì1 in the FA Cup final, to win their 13th FA Cup title.[98] On 28 October 2024, Manchester United sacked Erik ten Hag after the club managed just three wins in the opening nine games of the Premier League season.[99] On 1 November 2024, Manchester United announced that they would be appointing Sporting CP boss Ruben Amorim as their new head coach from 11 November 2024.[100] The club crest is derived from the Manchester City Council coat of arms, although all that remains of it on the current crest is the ship in full sail.[101] The devil stems from the club's nickname \"The Red Devils\" inspired from Salford Rugby Club;[102][103] it was included on club programmes and scarves in the 1960s, and incorporated into the club crest in 1970, although the crest was not included on the chest of the shirt until 1971.[101] In 1975, the red devil (\"A devil facing the sinister guardant supporting with both hands a trident gules\") was granted as a heraldic badge by the College of Arms to the English Football League for use by Manchester United.[104] In 2023, the Red Devil motif alone, which had been used in promotional items and merchandise previously, was used as the sole badge on the Manchester United third kit. The existing crest remains on the home and away kits. Newton Heath's uniform in 1879, four years before the club played its first competitive match, has been documented as 'white with blue cord'.[105] A photograph of the Newton Heath team, taken in 1892, is believed to show the players wearing red-and-white quartered jerseys and navy blue knickerbockers.[106] Between 1894 and 1896, the players wore green and gold jerseys[106] which were replaced in 1896 by white shirts, which were worn with navy blue shorts.[106] After the name change in 1902, the club colours were changed to red shirts, white shorts, and black socks, which has become the standard Manchester United home kit.[106] Very few changes were made to the kit until 1922 when the club adopted white shirts bearing a deep red \"V\" around the neck, similar to the shirt worn in the 1909 FA Cup final. They remained part of their home kits until 1927.[106] For a period in 1934, the cherry and white hooped change shirt became the home colours, but the following season the red shirt was recalled after the club's lowest ever league placing of 20th in the Second Division and the hooped shirt dropped back to being the change.[106] The black socks were changed to white from 1959 to 1965, where they were replaced with red socks up until 1971 with white used on occasion, when the club reverted to black. Black shorts and white socks are sometimes worn with the home strip, most often in away games, if there is a clash with the opponent's kit. For 2018‚Äì19, black shorts and red socks became the primary choice for the home kit.[107] Since 1997‚Äì98, white socks have been the preferred choice for European games, which are typically played on weeknights, to aid with player visibility.[108] The current home kit is a red shirt with Adidas' trademark three stripes in red on the shoulders, white shorts, and black socks.[109] The Manchester United away strip has often been a white shirt, black shorts and white socks, but there have been several exceptions. These include an all-black strip with blue and gold trimmings between 1993 and 1995, the navy blue shirt with silver horizontal pinstripes worn during the 1999‚Äì2000 season,[110] and the 2011‚Äì12 away kit, which had a royal blue body and sleeves with hoops made of small midnight navy blue and black stripes, with black shorts and blue socks.[111] An all-grey away kit worn during the 1995‚Äì96 season was dropped after just five games; in its final outing against Southampton, Alex Ferguson instructed the team to change into the third kit during half-time. The reason for dropping it being that the players claimed to have trouble finding their teammates against the crowd, United failed to win a competitive game in the kit in five attempts.[112] In 2001, to celebrate 100 years as \"Manchester United\", a reversible white and gold away kit was released, although the actual match day shirts were not reversible.[113] The club's third kit is often all-blue; this was most recently the case during the 2014‚Äì15 season.[114] Exceptions include a green-and-gold halved shirt worn between 1992 and 1994, a blue-and-white striped shirt worn during the 1994‚Äì95 and 1995‚Äì96 seasons and once in 1996‚Äì97, an all-black kit worn during the Treble-winning 1998‚Äì99 season, and a white shirt with black-and-red horizontal pinstripes worn between 2003‚Äì04 and 2005‚Äì06.[115] From 2006‚Äì07 to 2013‚Äì14, the third kit was the previous season's away kit, albeit updated with the new club sponsor in 2006‚Äì07 and 2010‚Äì11, apart from the 2008‚Äì09 season, when an all-blue kit was launched to mark the 40th anniversary of the 1967‚Äì68 European Cup success.[116] Newton Heath initially played on a field on North Road, close to the railway yard; the original capacity was about 12,000, but club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club hoping to join The Football League.[117] Some expansion took place in 1887, and in 1891, Newton Heath used its minimal financial reserves to purchase two grandstands, each able to hold 1,000 spectators.[118] Although attendances were not recorded for many of the earliest matches at North Road, the highest documented attendance was approximately 15,000 for a First Division match against Sunderland on 4 March 1893.[119] A similar attendance was also recorded for a friendly match against Gorton Villa on 5 September 1889.[120] In June 1893, after the club was evicted from North Road by its owners, Manchester Deans and Canons, who felt it was inappropriate for the club to charge an entry fee to the ground, secretary A. H. Albut procured the use of the Bank Street ground in Clayton.[121] It initially had no stands, by the start of the 1893‚Äì94 season, two had been built; one spanning the full length of the pitch on one side and the other behind the goal at the \"Bradford end\". At the opposite end, the \"Clayton end\", the ground had been \"built up, thousands thus being provided for\".[121] Newton Heath's first league match at Bank Street was played against Burnley on 1 September 1893, when 10,000 people saw Alf Farman score a hat-trick, Newton Heath's only goals in a 3‚Äì2 win. The remaining stands were completed for the following league game against Nottingham Forest three weeks later.[121] In October 1895, before the visit of Manchester City, the club purchased a 2,000-capacity stand from the Broughton Rangers rugby league club, and put up another stand on the \"reserved side\" (as distinct from the \"popular side\"); however, weather restricted the attendance for the Manchester City match to just 12,000.[122] When the Bank Street ground was temporarily closed by bailiffs in 1902, club captain Harry Stafford raised enough money to pay for the club's next away game at Bristol City and found a temporary ground at Harpurhey for the next reserves game against Padiham.[123] Following financial investment, new club president John Henry Davies paid ¬£500 for the erection of a new 1,000-seat stand at Bank Street.[124] Within four years, the stadium had cover on all four sides, as well as the ability to hold approximately 50,000 spectators, some of whom could watch from the viewing gallery atop the Main Stand.[124] Following Manchester United's first league title in 1908 and the FA Cup a year later, it was decided that Bank Street was too restrictive for Davies' ambition;[124] in February 1909, six weeks before the club's first FA Cup title, Old Trafford was named as the home of Manchester United, following the purchase of land for around ¬£60,000. Architect Archibald Leitch was given a budget of ¬£30,000 for construction; original plans called for seating capacity of 100,000, though budget constraints forced a revision to 77,000.[125][126] The building was constructed by Messrs Brameld and Smith of Manchester. The stadium's record attendance was registered on 25 March 1939, when an FA Cup semi-final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town drew 76,962 spectators.[127] Bombing in the Second World War destroyed much of the stadium; the central tunnel in the South Stand was all that remained of that quarter. After the war, the club received compensation from the War Damage Commission in the amount of ¬£22,278. While reconstruction took place, the team played its \"home\" games at Manchester City's Maine Road ground; Manchester United was charged ¬£5,000 per year, plus a nominal percentage of gate receipts.[128] Later improvements included the addition of roofs, first to the Stretford End and then to the North and East Stands. The roofs were supported by pillars that obstructed many fans' views, and they were eventually replaced with a cantilevered structure. The Stretford End was the last stand to receive a cantilevered roof, completed in time for the 1993‚Äì94 season.[37] First used on 25 March 1957 and costing ¬£40,000, four 180-foot (55 m) pylons were erected, each housing 54 individual floodlights. These were dismantled in 1987 and replaced by a lighting system embedded in the roof of each stand, which remains in use today.[129] The Taylor Report's requirement for an all-seater stadium lowered capacity at Old Trafford to around 44,000 by 1993. In 1995, the North Stand was redeveloped into three tiers, restoring capacity to approximately 55,000. At the end of the 1998‚Äì99 season, second tiers were added to the East and West Stands, raising capacity to around 67,000, and between July 2005 and May 2006, 8,000 more seats were added via second tiers in the north-west and north-east quadrants. Part of the new seating was used for the first time on 26 March 2006, when an attendance of 69,070 became a new Premier League record.[130] The record was pushed steadily upwards before reaching its peak on 31 March 2007, when 76,098 spectators saw Manchester United beat Blackburn Rovers 4‚Äì1, with just 114 seats (0.15 per cent of the total capacity of 76,212) unoccupied.[131] In 2009, reorganisation of the seating resulted in a reduction of capacity by 255 to 75,957.[132][133] Manchester United has the second highest average attendance among European football clubs, behind only Borussia Dortmund.[134][135][136] In 2021, United co-chairman Joel Glazer said that \"early-stage planning work\" for the redevelopment of Old Trafford was underway. This followed \"increasing criticism\" over the lack of development of the ground since 2006.[137] After the club's takeover by Sir Jim Ratcliffe in 2024, it emerged that plans were being made for the construction of a new, 100,000-capacity stadium near Old Trafford and that the current stadium would be downsized to serve as the home for the women's team and the club's academy.[138] In November 2024, it was revealed that the majority of fans surveyed are in favour of a new-build rather than redevelopment.[139] Manchester United is one of the most popular football clubs in the world, with one of the highest average home attendances in Europe.[140] The club states that its worldwide fan base includes more than 200 officially recognised branches of the Manchester United Supporters Club (MUSC), in at least 24 countries.[141] The club takes advantage of this support through its worldwide summer tours. Accountancy firm and sports industry consultants Deloitte estimate that Manchester United has 75 million fans worldwide.[11] The club has the third highest social media following in the world among sports teams (after Barcelona and Real Madrid), with over 82 million Facebook followers as of July 2023.[12][142] A 2014 study showed that Manchester United had the loudest fans in the Premier League.[143] Supporters are represented by two independent bodies; the Independent Manchester United Supporters' Association (IMUSA), which maintains close links to the club through the MUFC Fans Forum,[144] and the Manchester United Supporters' Trust (MUST). After the Glazer family's takeover in 2005, a group of fans formed a splinter club, F.C. United of Manchester. The West Stand of Old Trafford ‚Äì the \"Stretford End\" ‚Äì is the home end and the traditional source of the club's most vocal support.[145] Manchester United has high-profile rivalries with Liverpool and local neighbours Manchester City. The club has also had rivalries throughout its history with the likes of Arsenal, Leeds United and Chelsea.[146][147] The matches against Manchester City are known as the Manchester derby, as they are the two most important teams in the city of Manchester. It is considered one of the biggest local derbies in British football,[148] particularly after City's rise to prominence in the 2010s and the two clubs fighting for trophies, such as the league title in 2012 and 2013, as well as two consecutive FA Cup finals in 2023 and 2024.[149] The rivalry with Liverpool is rooted in competition between the cities during the Industrial Revolution, when Manchester was famous for its textile industry while Liverpool was a major port.[150] The two clubs are the most successful in the history of English football; between them they have won 39 league titles, 9 European Cups, 21 FA Cups, 16 League Cups, 4 UEFA Cup/Europa Leagues, 2 FIFA Club World Cups, 1 Intercontinental Cup, 37 FA Community Shields and 5 UEFA Super Cups.[7][151][152] Ranked the two biggest clubs in England by France Football magazine based on metrics such as fanbase and historical importance,[153] matches between Manchester United and Liverpool are considered to be the most famous fixture in English football and one of the biggest rivalries in the football world.[154][155][156][157] No player has been transferred between the clubs since 1964.[158] Former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said in 2002, \"My greatest challenge was knocking Liverpool right off their fucking perch\".[159] The \"Roses Rivalry\" with Leeds stems from the Wars of the Roses, fought between the House of Lancaster and the House of York, with Manchester United representing Lancashire and Leeds representing Yorkshire.[160] The rivalry with Arsenal arose from the numerous times the two teams battled for the Premier League title, especially under managers Alex Ferguson and Ars√®ne Wenger, who also had a heated personal rivalry.[161] With 33 titles between them (20 for Manchester United, 13 for Arsenal), the fixture has been described as a \"blockbuster\" and the \"greatest\" rivalry in the history of the Premier League.[162][163] Manchester United has been described as a global brand; a 2011 report by Brand Finance, valued the club's trademarks and associated intellectual property at ¬£412 million ‚Äì an increase of ¬£39 million on the previous year, valuing it at ¬£11 million more than the second best brand, Real Madrid ‚Äì and gave the brand a strength rating of AAA (Extremely Strong).[164] In July 2012, Manchester United was ranked first by Forbes magazine in its list of the ten most valuable sports team brands, valuing the Manchester United brand at $2.23 billion.[165] The club is ranked third in the Deloitte Football Money League (behind Real Madrid and Barcelona).[166] In January 2013, the club became the first sports team in the world to be valued at $3 billion.[167] Forbes magazine valued the club at $3.3 billion ‚Äì $1.2 billion higher than the next most valuable sports team.[167] They were overtaken by Real Madrid for the next four years, but Manchester United returned to the top of the Forbes list in June 2017, with a valuation of $3.689 billion.[168] The core strength of Manchester United's global brand is often attributed to Matt Busby's rebuilding of the team and subsequent success following the Munich air disaster, which drew worldwide acclaim.[145] The \"iconic\" team included Bobby Charlton and Nobby Stiles (members of England's World Cup winning team), Denis Law and George Best. The attacking style of play adopted by this team (in contrast to the defensive-minded \"catenaccio\" approach favoured by the leading Italian teams of the era) \"captured the imagination of the English footballing public\".[169] Busby's team also became associated with the liberalisation of Western society during the 1960s; George Best, known as the \"Fifth Beatle\" for his iconic haircut, was the first footballer to significantly develop an off-the-field media profile.[169] As the second English football club to float on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club raised significant capital, with which it further developed its commercial strategy. The club's focus on commercial and sporting success brought significant profits in an industry often characterised by chronic losses.[170] The strength of the Manchester United brand was bolstered by intense off-the-field media attention to individual players, most notably David Beckham (who quickly developed his own global brand). This attention often generates greater interest in on-the-field activities, and hence generates sponsorship opportunities ‚Äì the value of which is driven by television exposure.[171] During his time with the club, Beckham's popularity across Asia was integral to the club's commercial success in that part of the world.[172] Because higher league placement results in a greater share of television rights, success on the field generates greater income for the club. Since the inception of the Premier League, Manchester United has received the largest share of the revenue generated from the BSkyB broadcasting deal.[173] Manchester United has also consistently enjoyed the highest commercial income of any English club; in 2005‚Äì06, the club's commercial arm generated ¬£51 million, compared to ¬£42.5 million at Chelsea, ¬£39.3 million at Liverpool, ¬£34 million at Arsenal and ¬£27.9 million at Newcastle United. A key sponsorship relationship was with sportswear company Nike, who managed the club's merchandising operation as part of a ¬£303 million 13-year partnership between 2002 and 2015.[174] Through Manchester United Finance and the club's membership scheme, One United, those with an affinity for the club can purchase a range of branded goods and services. Additionally, Manchester United-branded media services ‚Äì such as the club's dedicated television channel, MUTV ‚Äì have allowed the club to expand its fan base to those beyond the reach of its Old Trafford stadium.[11] In an initial five-year deal worth ¬£500,000, Sharp Electronics became the club's first shirt sponsor at the beginning of the 1982‚Äì83 season, a relationship that lasted until the end of the 1999‚Äì2000 season, when Vodafone agreed a four-year, ¬£30 million deal.[176] Vodafone agreed to pay ¬£36 million to extend the deal by four years, but after two seasons triggered a break clause in order to concentrate on its sponsorship of the Champions League.[176] To commence at the start of the 2006‚Äì07 season, American insurance corporation AIG agreed a four-year ¬£56.5 million deal which in September 2006 became the most valuable in the world.[177][178] At the beginning of the 2010‚Äì11 season, American reinsurance company Aon became the club's principal sponsor in a four-year deal reputed to be worth approximately ¬£80 million, making it the most lucrative shirt sponsorship deal in football history.[179] Manchester United announced their first training kit sponsor in August 2011, agreeing a four-year deal with DHL reported to be worth ¬£40 million; it is believed to be the first instance of training kit sponsorship in English football.[180][181] The DHL contract lasted for over a year before the club bought back the contract in October 2012, although they remained the club's official logistics partner.[182] The contract for the training kit sponsorship was then sold to Aon in April 2013 for a deal worth ¬£180 million over eight years, which also included purchasing the naming rights for the Trafford Training Centre.[183] The club's first kit manufacturer was Umbro, until a five-year deal was agreed with Admiral Sportswear in 1975.[184] Adidas won the contract in 1980,[185] before Umbro started a second spell in 1992.[186] That sponsorship lasted for ten years, followed by Nike's record-breaking ¬£302.9 million deal, which lasted until 2015; 3.8 million replica shirts were sold in the first 22 months with the company.[187][188] In addition to Nike and Chevrolet, the club also has several lower-level \"platinum\" sponsors, including Aon and Budweiser.[189] On 30 July 2012, United signed a seven-year deal with American automotive corporation General Motors, which replaced Aon as the shirt sponsor from the 2014‚Äì15 season. The new $80m-a-year shirt deal is worth $559m over seven years and features the logo of General Motors brand Chevrolet.[190][191] Nike announced that they would not renew their kit supply deal with Manchester United after the 2014‚Äì15 season, citing rising costs.[192][193] Since the start of the 2015‚Äì16 season, Adidas has manufactured Manchester United's kit as part of a world-record 10-year deal worth a minimum of ¬£750 million.[194][195] Plumbing products manufacturer Kohler became the club's first sleeve sponsor ahead of the 2018‚Äì19 season.[196] Manchester United and General Motors did not renew their sponsorship deal, and the club subsequently signed a five-year, ¬£235 million sponsorship deal with TeamViewer ahead of the 2021‚Äì22 season.[197] At the end of the 2023‚Äì24 season, TeamViewer were replaced by Snapdragon, who agreed a deal worth more than ¬£60 million a year to take over as the club's main sponsor.[198] In August 2024, Snapdragon's parent company Qualcomm triggered an option to extend the deal by two years, taking it through to 2029.[199] Originally funded by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, the club became a limited company in 1892 and sold shares to local supporters for ¬£1 via an application form.[19] In 1902, majority ownership passed to the four local businessmen who invested ¬£500 to save the club from bankruptcy, including future club president John Henry Davies.[19] After his death in 1927, the club faced bankruptcy yet again, but was saved in December 1931 by James W. Gibson, who assumed control of the club after an investment of ¬£2,000.[24] Gibson promoted his son, Alan, to the board in 1948,[200] but died three years later; the Gibson family retained ownership of the club through James' wife, Lillian,[201] but the position of chairman passed to former player Harold Hardman.[202] Promoted to the board a few days after the Munich air disaster, Louis Edwards, a friend of Matt Busby, began acquiring shares in the club; for an investment of approximately ¬£40,000, he accumulated a 54 per cent shareholding and took control in January 1964.[203] When Lillian Gibson died in January 1971, her shares passed to Alan Gibson who sold a percentage of his shares to Louis Edwards' son, Martin, in 1978; Martin Edwards went on to become chairman upon his father's death in 1980.[204] Media tycoon Robert Maxwell attempted to buy the club in 1984, but did not meet Edwards' asking price.[204] In 1989, chairman Martin Edwards attempted to sell the club to Michael Knighton for ¬£20 million, but the sale fell through and Knighton joined the board of directors instead.[204] Manchester United was floated on the stock market in June 1991 (raising ¬£6.7 million),[205] and received yet another takeover bid in 1998, this time from Rupert Murdoch's British Sky Broadcasting Corporation. This resulted in the formation of Shareholders United Against Murdoch ‚Äì now the Manchester United Supporters' Trust ‚Äì who encouraged supporters to buy shares in the club in an attempt to block any hostile takeover. The Manchester United board accepted a ¬£623 million offer,[206] but the takeover was blocked by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission at the final hurdle in April 1999.[207] A few years later, a power struggle emerged between the club's manager, Alex Ferguson, and his horse-racing partners, John Magnier and J. P. McManus, who had gradually become the majority shareholders. In a dispute that stemmed from contested ownership of the horse Rock of Gibraltar, Magnier and McManus attempted to have Ferguson removed from his position as manager, and the board responded by approaching investors to attempt to reduce the Irishmen's majority.[208] In May 2005, Malcolm Glazer purchased the 28.7 per cent stake held by McManus and Magnier, thus acquiring a controlling interest through his investment vehicle Red Football Ltd in a highly leveraged takeover valuing the club at approximately ¬£800 million (then approx. $1.5 billion).[209] Once the purchase was complete, the club was taken off the stock exchange.[210] Much of the takeover money was borrowed by the Glazers; the debts were transferred to the club. As a result, the club went from being debt-free to being saddled with debts of ¬£540 million, at interest rates of between 7% and 20%.[15][211][212] In July 2006, the club announced a ¬£660 million debt refinancing package, resulting in a 30 per cent reduction in annual interest payments to ¬£62 million a year.[213][214] In January 2010, with debts of ¬£716.5 million ($1.17 billion),[215] Manchester United further refinanced through a bond issue worth ¬£504 million, enabling them to pay off most of the ¬£509 million owed to international banks.[216] The annual interest payable on the bonds ‚Äì which were to mature on 1 February 2017 ‚Äì is approximately ¬£45 million per annum.[217] Despite restructuring, the club's debt prompted protests from fans on 23 January 2010, at Old Trafford and the club's Trafford Training Centre.[218][219] Supporter groups encouraged match-going fans to wear green and gold, the colours of Newton Heath. On 30 January, reports emerged that the Manchester United Supporters' Trust had held meetings with a group of wealthy fans, dubbed the \"Red Knights\", with plans to buying out the Glazers' controlling interest.[220] The club's debts reached a high of ¬£777 million in June 2007.[221] In August 2011, the Glazers were believed to have approached Credit Suisse in preparation for a $1 billion (approx. ¬£600 million) initial public offering (IPO) on the Singapore stock exchange that would value the club at more than ¬£2 billion;[222] however, in July 2012, the club announced plans to list its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange instead.[223] Shares were originally set to go on sale for between $16 and $20 each, but the price was cut to $14 by the launch of the IPO on 10 August, following negative comments from Wall Street analysts and Facebook's disappointing stock market debut in May. Even after the cut, Manchester United was valued at $2.3 billion, making it the most valuable football club in the world.[224] The New York Stock Exchange allows for different shareholders to enjoy different voting rights over the club. Shares offered to the public (\"Class A\") had 10 times lesser voting rights than shares retained by the Glazers (\"Class B\").[225] Initially in 2012, only 10% of shares were offered to the public.[226] As of 2019, the Glazers retain ultimate control over the club, with over 70% of shares, and even higher voting power.[227] In 2012, The Guardian estimated that the club had paid a total of over ¬£500 million in debt interest and other fees on behalf of the Glazers,[228] and in 2019, reported that the total sum paid by the club for such fees had risen to ¬£1 billion.[212] At the end of 2019, the club had a net debt of nearly ¬£400 million.[229] In 2023, the Glazers began soliciting bids for the sale of the club, and several bids were received. Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who owns Ineos, and Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, a Qatari sheikh, were the only bidders who had publicly declared their interest in a controlling share of the club.[230] In March 2023, Finnish entrepreneur Thomas Zilliacus also made his interest in Manchester United public.[231] On 24 December 2023, it was announced that Ratcliffe had purchased 25 per cent of Manchester United, and that his Ineos Sport company was taking control of football operations.[232] The Glazers remain as majority shareholders.

Manchester United is one of the most successful clubs in Europe in terms of trophies won.[271] The club's first trophy was the Manchester Cup, which they won as Newton Heath LYR in 1886.[272] In 1908, the club won their first league title, and won the FA Cup for the first time the following year. Since then, they have gone on to win a record 20 top-division titles ‚Äì including a record 13 Premier League titles ‚Äì and their total of 13 FA Cups is second only to Arsenal (14). Those titles have meant the club has appeared a record 30 times in the FA Community Shield (formerly the FA Charity Shield), which is played at the start of each season between the winners of the league and FA Cup from the previous season; of those 30 appearances, Manchester United have won a record 21, including four times when the match was drawn and the trophy shared by the two clubs. The club had a successful period under the management of Matt Busby, starting with the FA Cup in 1948 and culminating with becoming the first English club to win the European Cup in 1968, winning five league titles and two FA Cups in the intervening years. The club's most successful decade, however, came in the 1990s under Alex Ferguson; five league titles, four FA Cups, one League Cup, five Charity Shields (one shared), one UEFA Champions League, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup and one Intercontinental Cup. The club has won the Double (winning the Premier League and FA Cup in the same season) three times; the second in 1995‚Äì96 saw them become the first club to do so twice, and it became referred to as the \"Double Double\".[273] United became the sole British club to win the Intercontinental Cup in 1999 and are one of only three British clubs to have won the FIFA Club World Cup, in 2008. In 1999, United became the first English club to win the Treble.[50] In 2017, United won the 2016‚Äì17 UEFA Europa League, beating Ajax in the final. In winning that title, United became the fifth club to have won the \"European Treble\" of European Cup/UEFA Champions League, Cup Winners' Cup, and UEFA Cup/Europa League after Juventus, Ajax, Bayern Munich and Chelsea.[274][275] The club's most recent trophy is the 2023‚Äì24 FA Cup.[276] Short competitions ‚Äì such as the FA Charity/Community Shield, Intercontinental Cup (now defunct), FIFA Club World Cup or UEFA Super Cup ‚Äì are not generally considered to contribute towards a Double or Treble.[277] Manchester United Supporters Club Ladies began operations in the late 1970s and was unofficially recognised as the club's senior women's team. They became founding members of the North West Women's Regional Football League in 1989.[278] The team made an official partnership with Manchester United in 2001, becoming the club's official women's team; however, in 2005, following Malcolm Glazer's takeover, the club was disbanded as it was seen to be \"unprofitable\".[279] In 2018, Manchester United formed a new women's football team, which entered the second division of women's football in England for their debut season. The women's football team won their first trophy on 12 May 2024 as they lifted the Women's FA Cup as they defeated Tottenham Hotspur 4‚Äì0.",

The club was formed as Newton Heath LYR in 1878 by workers from the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. Renamed Manchester United in 1902, the club won its first English league championship in 1907‚Äì08. In 1910 the club moved from its old Bank Street ground into Old Trafford stadium, which has served as the team‚Äôs home ever since. Manchester United‚Äôs history since World War II has been dominated by two long-serving managers. Sir Matthew Busby was appointed manager in 1945 and over the next 24 years steered the club to five English league and two FA Cup victories. The club had to contend with tragedy in 1958 when an aircraft carrying the team crashed in Munich, killing 23 of the 44 onboard. In the 1960s the team, rebuilt by Busby, included the highly talented attacking trio of Bobby Charlton, George Best, and Denis Law. In 1968 this team became the first English club to win the European Cup (now known as the Champions League) with a 4‚Äì1 victory over Benfica of Portugal in the final. The former coach of the Scottish team Aberdeen, Alex Ferguson, managed the club from 1986 to 2013 and presided over an unparalleled spell of dominance in the English league. Manchester United has won 12 Premier League titles since that league‚Äôs inaugural season in 1992‚Äì93. In the 1998‚Äì99 season the club secured the first ‚Äútreble‚Äù in English football history by winning the Premier League, the FA Cup, and the Champions League. A second Champions League victory came in the 2007‚Äì08 season. Dramatically, the club lost another possible title on the last day of the 2011‚Äì12 season, when the other top Premier League team in the city, Manchester City FC, snatched the league title on point difference. The two Premier League clubs have elevated the city‚Äôs status worldwide. Manchester United is renowned for its youth team program, which has generated many notable homegrown players who later performed for the club‚Äôs first team, including David Beckham. The club has also brought in a number of major transfer signings over the years, such as Wayne Rooney, Rio Ferdinand, Andy Cole, Roy Keane, Eric Cantona, Patrice Evra, Dimitar Berbatov, and Cristiano Ronaldo.",

                "content": "Chelsea is an English given name derived from the Old English place name ƒãealc h»≥√∞,[1] or the modern Celcyth, meaning chalk landing place. The name evolved to Chelsea, a location on the River Thames that became a London borough known for its wealthy, socially influential residents. Many locations have been named after the English place name Chelsea.[2] The given name, a transferred use of the place name, was in use for boys in the New England region of the United States by the late 18th century and was first used for American girls in the 1840s.[2] The name was first popularized for girls in larger numbers in the United States by American comedian Chelsea Brown, who was born Lois Brown but chose Chelsea as a stage name. After Brown began appearing on the American television program Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In in 1968, the name quadrupled in use for American girls to 48 uses that year. The name debuted among the 1,000 most popular names for American girls in 1969, in 702nd place. Chelsea Morning, a 1969 hit song written about mornings in Chelsea, Manhattan by Canadian singer Joni Mitchell and later performed by Judy Collins, further popularized the name for girls with its descriptive lyrics such as \"the light poured in like butterscotch.\"[2] The name of Chelsea Clinton, daughter of American President Bill Clinton and former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, was inspired by the song when she was born in 1980. The name Chelsea increased further in popularity in the 1980s due to its use for film and television characters, such as Chelsea Thayer Wayne, a character played by Jane Fonda in the 1981 American film On Golden Pond and Chelsea Reardon, a character played by Kassie DePaiva on the American soap opera Guiding Light beginning in 1986. In 1992, the name reached peak popularity in the United States and would have been the eighth most popular name for American girls in that year if all spellings of the name were combined. The name dramatically declined in use in 1993, during the first year of Bill Clinton's presidency. At the time, it was out of fashion in the United States to name children after politicians and those who were associated with them. The name has continued to decline in use, but remained among the 1,000 most popular names for American girls in 2023.[2] Spelling variants in use in the United States include Chelsey, Chelsi, Chelsie, and Chelsy.[2] The name has also been in regular use throughout the Anglosphere, including Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, as well as in Belgium, France and Netherlands.[3]",

                "content": "Morgan Cole Wallen (born May 13, 1993) is an American country singer and songwriter. He competed in the sixth season of The Voice, originally as a member of Usher's team, but later as a member of Adam Levine's team. After being eliminated in the playoffs of that season, he signed to Panacea Records, releasing his debut EP, Stand Alone, in 2015. In 2016, Wallen signed to Big Loud, releasing his debut album, If I Know Me, in 2018. The album includes the singles \"Up Down\" featuring Florida Georgia Line, \"Whiskey Glasses\", and \"Chasin' You\". If I Know Me reached No. 1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart. Wallen's second album, Dangerous: The Double Album, was released in January 2021, and in February 2021 became the only country album in the 64-year history of the Billboard 200 to spend its first seven weeks at No. 1.[4] It spent its first ten weeks at number one, the first album to do so since Whitney Houston's Whitney in 1987.[5] The album included singles \"More Than My Hometown\", \"7 Summers\", and \"Wasted on You\".[6] His third studio album, One Thing at a Time (2023), topped the Billboard 200 for 19 non-consecutive weeks, with all of its 36 tracks entering the Billboard Hot 100. This broke the record for most songs by an artist on the chart at one time.[7] The single \"Last Night\" peaked atop the Hot 100 in 2023, becoming Wallen's first single to do so, and later set the record for the most weeks at number one for a non-collaboration song (sixteen weeks), as well as tying for the second most weeks of all time and topping the year-end chart. He has received several awards including an Academy of Country Music Award and fourteen Billboard Music Awards.[8] He won Entertainer of the Year at the 58th Annual Country Music Association Awards.[9] Morgan Cole Wallen was born on May 13, 1993, in Sneedville, Tennessee, to Tommy and Lesli Wallen.[10] Tommy served for a time as a local church pastor,[11] while Lesli worked as a teacher. In his teens, the family moved south to Knox County, where he graduated from Gibbs High School.[12] He was a pitcher and shortstop for the school's baseball team, and hoped to continue in college, but tore his ulnar collateral ligament his senior year.[13] As a child, Wallen took piano and violin lessons. He was raised on a diverse musical playlist, with his father exposing him to classic rock mainstays. In his teens, he gravitated towards bands like Breaking Benjamin and Nickelback, as well as rappers like Lil Wayne.[14] Wallen has characterized his early adulthood as adrift; he worked in landscaping after high school and was disappointed by his inability to continue his baseball career.[11] He re-approached his interest in music and began learning guitar.[14] He had grown to love country music, especially artists like Keith Whitley and Eric Church, and he modeled his sound after that lineage.[14] In 2014, Wallen competed on season 6 of the music competition program The Voice. He auditioned with the song \"Collide\" by Howie Day. Judges Shakira and Usher complimented his stylings, and Wallen joined Usher's team. He was later taken by Adam Levine's team after his second round, and later eliminated during the playoffs.[13] Wallen later said of his experience on the show, \"Some things in life are out of your control. Being the best you can be isn't. I didn't feel like I was the best I could have been. So I practiced harder\".[14] The Voice was instrumental in raising Wallen's profile, and he began to establish connections in the music industry.[12] While in California to appear on The Voice, Wallen began working with Sergio Sanchez of Atom Smash, a vocal coach on the program. Wallen relocated to Nashville to further his career, and he and Sanchez started a temporary band: Morgan Wallen & Them Shadows.[12] Sanchez introduced Wallen to Bill Ray and Paul Trust of Panacea Records.[15] In 2015, Wallen signed to Panacea Records where he was joined by Dominic Frost on guitar and released the Stand Alone (EP) on August 24, 2015. \"Spin You Around\" was Wallen's debut single under Panacea Records; it was later certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2021.[16] In 2015, Wallen's manager, Dirk Hemsath of Working Group Artist Management, sent a demo of Wallen to record executive Seth England, who had Wallen audition for Big Loud, an independent record label. They signed Wallen to the label and the publishing company,[15] who began pairing his songs with other artists. That year, he released his debut single \"The Way I Talk\";[17] his first music video for the song followed in 2017.[18] Wallen co-wrote the A Thousand Horses's single \"Preachin' to the Choir\",[13] Dallas Smith's \"The Fall\",[19] as well as Jason Aldean's \"You Make It Easy\" with Florida Georgia Line's Tyler Hubbard, Brian Kelley, and Jordan Schmidt.[20] He joined Florida Georgia Line on their Dig Your Roots Tour.[13] He collaborated with the group on the single \"Up Down\", his first song to reach the top five of Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart.[21] At the outset of his career, Wallen underwent a personal stylistic shift, adopting a distinctive mullet and a look that Kelefa Sanneh, profiling Wallen's rise in a piece for The New Yorker, described as \"Everyman rock star\" and \"not just a singer but a character\".[11] Wallen had decided to adopt the retro hairdo after seeing a younger photo of his father with the cut.[14] Wallen's debut studio album, If I Know Me, was released on April 27, 2018,[22] with its third single, \"Whiskey Glasses\", becoming his biggest success yet.[23] The song reached the top spot on both the Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay charts; it also marked his top 40 appearance on the all-genre Hot 100 ranking, where it placed at number 17. It was Billboard's 2019 top Hot Country song and Top Country Airplay song.[24] Sanneh characterized \"Whiskey Glasses\" as his signature song and a \"perfectly constructed ode to a woman and a drink, lost and found, respectively\".[11] In 2019, Wallen joined Florida Georgia Line on their Can't Say I Ain't Country Tour.[25] His next single, \"Chasin' You\", was serviced to radio in July 2019 and peaked at number two on the Hot Country Songs chart;[26][6] like its predecessor, it captured the top spot on the overall year-end tally for 2020.[14] In August 2020, If I Know Me reached No. 1 on the Top Country Albums chart after a record-breaking 114 weeks. Wallen's profile continued to rise, with a growing following on platforms like TikTok, and he developed into an unwitting sex symbol.[11] Wallen appeared on the cover of Billboard, whose headline read: \"Is Morgan Wallen Country's Next Global Star?\"[14] At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Wallen found himself with more time to write and record material, which developed into his sophomore album, the double-disc Dangerous: The Double Album (2021),[27] which showcases a mix of country and R&B/pop balladry.[12] Dangerous was an immediate blockbuster: it debuted atop the US Billboard 200 and the Canadian Albums Chart;[28][29] it would remain atop the Canadian chart for four consecutive weeks, and the US chart for six consecutive weeks, marking the first new album from a country artist to do that since Garth Brooks' The Chase in 1992.[30][31][32][33] Its singles‚Äî\"More Than My Hometown\", \"7 Summers\", \"Sand in My Boots\" and \"Wasted on You\"‚Äîwere record-breaking hit songs that pushed Wallen farther into the national conversation. \"7 Summers\" earned him his first top 10 on the Hot 100, debuting and peaking at number six,[34] and was also chosen by Time as one of the best songs of the year.[35] Wallen soon became the first artist to ever chart six songs within the top 10 of Hot Country Songs chart at the same time in the week after his album's release;[36] likewise, the album charted 23 tracks on the Canadian Hot 100,[37] and 19 tracks on the Hot 100 in the US.[38] On February 2, 2021, TMZ released a video recorded on January 31 showing Wallen using the racial slur \"nigger\" to one of his friends after a night out.[39][40] He issued a statement shortly after and apologized.[41] Several radio stations temporarily removed Wallen's music from airplay on their stations, and his songs were removed from Apple Music, Pandora and Spotify featured playlists.[42][43] CMT and the Country Music Association removed Wallen's appearances from their platforms, and his record label Big Loud (and partner Republic Records) suspended its recording contract with him indefinitely.[44][45] The Academy of Country Music announced that Wallen and the album Dangerous: The Double Album would be ineligible for the 56th Annual Academy of Country Music Awards.[46][47] On February 10, Wallen shot an apology video in which he asked his fans not to defend him.[48] In April 2021, Wallen donated $300,000 to the Black Music Action Coalition in the names of 20 people who had counseled him following the incident. Those individuals were given the option to funnel their respective $15,000 donations to a charity of their choice, or keep the money within the BMAC.[49] Wallen publicly spoke of his comments on Good Morning America on July 23, where he said that \"he was around some of his friends, and they say dumb stuff together\" and said that \"he was wrong\" to express those words.[50] Wallen's songs returned to country radio in August when his single \"Sand in My Boots\" was released.[51] He was nominated for Favorite Male Country Artist and Favorite Country Album for the 2021 American Music Awards, but was not invited to attend the ceremony, and was consequently unable to accept any awards if he won, which he did not.[52] Though his public image took a hit, Wallen‚Äôs popularity increased.[53] In the week following the controversy, album sales of Dangerous surged. In some cases, the physical as well as digital album sales went up over 100% in the week following the controversy.[54] He remained atop the Billboard charts for seven more weeks; If I Know Me even entered the top 10 for the first time.[55] Over the ensuing years, Dangerous remained a juggernaut; Ben Sisario, writing in The New York Times, dubbed it \"an unusually enduring hit\".[56] It has continued to break chart records:[30] it was the best-performing album of 2021,[57] and in 2022, the album broke the record for the most weeks in the top 10 on the Billboard 200 chart among albums by a singular artist, surpassing a goal set a half-century before.[58] Dangerous was awarded Album of the Year at the Academy of Country Music;[59] Wallen also won Favorite Male Artist and Favorite Album at the inaugural Country Now Awards.[60] Wallen has continued to release new music, and has remained a popular draw on the road. The Dangerous Tour of arenas and amphitheaters was completely sold-out.[57][61] His single \"You Proof\" became his second Hot 100 hit and first to reach the top five; both \"You Proof\" and \"Thought You Should Know\" topped the country charts. Wallen also collaborated with rapper Lil Durk on the song \"Broadway Girls\", a top-15 hit on the Hot 100; he also performed the song live with Durk at MLK Freedom Fest in Nashville.[62] Wallen was a co-writer on the Tyler Joe Miller single \"Wild as Her\", released in February 2022, and the Keith Urban single \"Brown Eyes Baby, released in July 2022.[63][64] In December 2022, Wallen released a sampler EP titled One Thing at a Time, featuring three songs he had been working on up until this point, titled \"One Thing at a Time\", \"Tennessee Fan\" and \"Days That End in Why\".[65] In 2023, Wallen expanded to stadiums with his One Night at a Time World Tour.[66] Wallen released his third studio album One Thing at a Time on March 3, 2023.[67] On April 23, 2023, at Vaught‚ÄìHemingway Stadium in Oxford, Mississippi, just minutes before he was set to perform, Wallen announced that he could not perform due to losing his voice. Fans were directed to receive refunds at their points of purchase.[68] In May 2023, Wallen was featured on the song \"Stand by Me\" from Lil Durk's eighth studio album, Almost Healed. Wallen was a co-writer on the 2023 single \"Fixer Upper\" by Dallas Smith.[69][70] On January 26, 2024, Panacea Records released a deluxe 10th anniversary edition of Morgan Wallen's 2015 EP Stand Alone that included eight previously unreleased songs. These songs were recorded in the same sessions as the original Stand Alone songs. Before the release of the 10th anniversary album, Wallen released a statement on his Instagram page saying that the release of this album was happening \"against his wishes\".[71] Wallen released \"Spin You Around (1/24)\", an acoustic re-recording of the original, in response to the album's release.[72] On March 3, 2024, he shared performances as part of his Abbey Road Sessions and performed a new song titled \"Lies Lies Lies\".[73] On May 2, 2024, Wallen announced his next single entitled \"I Had Some Help\" with Post Malone, which was released on May 10.[74] In September 2024, Wallen announced his second single from his upcoming fourth studio album, \"Love Somebody\", which was released on October 18.[75] It debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[76] Wallen was nominated for seven awards at the 58th Annual Country Music Association Awards, with his only win being the prestigious Entertainer of the Year award. Wallen was not in attendance to accept and the presenter, Jeff Bridges, jokingly accepted on his behalf.[77] In May 2020, Wallen was arrested and charged with public intoxication and disorderly conduct after leaving Kid Rock's bar in Nashville, Tennessee after reportedly kicking glass items inside the bar when he was told to leave, as well as getting into multiple verbal altercations with passersby outside.[78] He turned to Twitter the next day to publicly apologize, writing, \"I went out downtown last night with a few old friends. After a couple bar stops, we were horse-playing with each other. We didn't mean any harm, and we want to say sorry to any bar staff or anyone that was affected. Thank you to the local authorities for being so professional and doing their job with class.\"[79] The case was later settled in a court hearing.[80] In October 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple videos were posted on TikTok showing Wallen ignoring CDC guidelines in bars and other locations in the Tuscaloosa, Alabama, area after attending a University of Alabama football game. Wallen was shown partying maskless, not following social distancing guidelines, and kissing several women in these videos. Wallen was criticized for his conduct, partly as his ex-girlfriend had recently given birth. As a result of his actions, Wallen was cancelled as the musical guest on that week's episode of Saturday Night Live; he ultimately performed in an episode two months later hosted by actor Jason Bateman, in which Bateman, Wallen, and several cast members parody the incident and resulting fallout.[81][82][83][84] On April 7, 2024, Wallen was arrested after allegedly throwing a chair off the roof of Eric Church's newly-opened bar on Broadway in Nashville, Chief's. He was charged with three counts of felony reckless endangerment and one count of misdemeanor disorderly conduct after the projectile landed near two police officers on the ground.[85] Two weeks later, Wallen spoke out about the incident on Twitter, writing, \"I didn't feel right publicly checking in until I made amends with some folks. I've touched base with Nashville law enforcement, my family, and the good people at Chief's. I'm not proud of my behavior, and I accept responsibility. I have the utmost respect for the officers working every day to keep us all safe.\"[86] In December 2024, Wallen pled guilty to two misdemeanor counts of reckless endangerment, with the other two charges being dismissed, and was sentenced to serve seven days in a DUI education center, and two consecutive years of supervised probation.[87] In 2016, Wallen began a relationship with influencer KT Smith, and the couple got engaged several months later.[88][89] In 2019, they separated, allegedly due to Wallen's infidelity, and welcomed a son, Indigo (b. 2020), together several months after their breakup.[90][91][89] Smith is now married to another man.[89] Wallen has also been romantically linked with influencer Paige Lorenze,[92] and fellow country singer Megan Moroney, who allegedly wrote her breakout song \"Tennessee Orange\" about him.[93][94][95] On June 1, 2024, Wallen opened Morgan Wallen's This Bar & Tennessee Kitchen, a six-story bar, restaurant and music venue, in downtown Nashville.[96] Headlining Opening",

                "content": "Red One is a 2024 American Christmas fantasy action adventure comedy film directed by Jake Kasdan and written by Chris Morgan, from an original story by Hiram Garcia. It stars Dwayne Johnson, Chris Evans, Lucy Liu, J. K. Simmons, Kiernan Shipka, Bonnie Hunt, Nick Kroll, Kristofer Hivju, and Wesley Kimmel. In the film, Callum Drift (Johnson), the head of North Pole security, teams up with the hacker Jack O'Malley (Evans) to locate a kidnapped Santa Claus (Simmons) on Christmas Eve. Produced by Amazon MGM Studios, Seven Bucks Productions, Chris Morgan Productions, and The Detective Agency,[7][8] Red One is seen as the first of a Christmas-themed action film franchise. Principal photography for the film began in October 2022 and concluded in February 2023, with filming locations including Atlanta. Red One was first released theatrically by Warner Bros. Pictures internationally on November 6, 2024, and in the United States by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on November 15.[9] The film was a box-office bomb, grossing only $165.9 million worldwide on a budget of $200‚Äì$250 million, and has received mostly negative reviews from critics. M.O.R.A (Mythological Oversight and Restoration Authority) is a clandestine, multilateral military organization that oversees and protects a secret peace treaty between mythological creatures and humanity. Callum Drift, commander of ELF (Enforcement Logistics and Fortification), head of Santa Claus's security detail, requests to retire after one last Christmas run, as he has become disillusioned with increased naughty behavior in the world, exemplified by the growth of Santa's Naughty List. On Christmas Eve, a black ops team breaks into the North Pole complex and kidnaps Santa. Callum notifies Director Zoe Harlow about the kidnapping, and her team discovers that the North Pole's secret location was compromised by Jack O'Malley, a mercenary black-hat hacker who claims to be able to find anything in the world. Zoe apprehends Jack for questioning. A longtime Santa skeptic, Jack did not know the information he hacked was related to Santa and merely sent it to an anonymous buyer. Zoe offers to double Jack's payment if he helps them find Santa but places a tracker inside him. Callum reluctantly teams up with Jack to find Santa by tracking the broker who arranged the deal between Jack and the kidnapper in Aruba. The broker tells them the kidnapper is the winter witch, Gr√Ωla. Gr√Ωla becomes aware of their conversation and sends her snowmen to eliminate them; though Callum and Jack defeat them, the broker is iced in the scuffle. Callum suspects that Gr√Ωla might be working with Krampus, Santa's estranged adoptive brother, who is also Gr√Ωla's ex-lover and the one who created the Naughty List. Callum and Jack break into Krampus' lair but are captured. Callum appeals to Krampus to help his brother, who misses him, but Krampus refuses. He reveals that Gr√Ωla came to him to recover the glaskafig, a magical imprisoning snow globe. Despite being allowed to leave, Jack stays and persuades Krampus to play Krampusschlap with Callum, during which Jack recovers Callum's magic gauntlet and returns it to him, allowing the pair to escape. Gr√Ωla and her sons keep Santa in a vault that siphons his magic, knocking him unconscious. Gr√Ωla duplicates the glaskafig and intends to rid the world of every naughty child who has ever been on the Naughty List by imprisoning them forever. She tests the snow globes on Jack and his estranged son Dylan. She sends each of them a snow globe that imprisons them and returns to her lair. Jack and Dylan, inside their snow globes next to each other, have a heartfelt conversation that, by making them \"nicer\", causes the snow globes to break and free them. Zoe and Callum find Jack at the North Pole complex after using a tracker inside him. They realize that Gr√Ωla, her team, and Santa never left the North Pole. They also learn that Gr√Ωla's team of shapeshifters has taken over the complex. They go to the North Pole and free the imprisoned Mrs. Claus and other security staff. In Santa's old workshop, they find Jack and Dylan and the toy-duplicating equipment that Gr√Ωla used to mass-produce the snow globes. Because the North Pole equipment relies on Santa's powers, Gr√Ωla prepares to leave with an unconscious Santa using his sleigh to distribute the snow globes. A fight ensues, and Gr√Ωla is stopped by Callum and Jack, with an assist from Krampus, who arrives to help. Santa recovers and acknowledges his brother, while Gr√Ωla is sealed inside one of her snow globes and turned over to Zoe's custody. With Gr√Ωla defeated, everyone rapidly prepares for the night's Christmas Eve run. Santa invites Jack and Dylan to accompany him, which they accept. During the successful run, Callum watches Jack regain his wonder and build a relationship with Dylan; this convinces him to not retire. Hiram Garcia at Seven Bucks Productions conceived the idea for the film,[11] which was developed into a screenplay by Chris Morgan for Jake Kasdan to direct.[12] Chris Evans joined the cast in January 2022.[13] In September 2022, Kiernan Shipka was added to the cast.[14] Lucy Liu, Mary Elizabeth Ellis, J. K. Simmons, Nick Kroll, Kristofer Hivju, Wesley Kimmel and Bonnie Hunt joined the cast the following month, with Ellis revealing her and Simmons' involvement on Instagram.[15][16][17][18] Dwayne Johnson was paid $50 million for his involvement.[19] Filming began in October 2022 in Atlanta and wrapped in February 2023.[16][20] Filming ran into issues with Johnson, who was an average of seven to eight hours late to film his scenes and missed several days of shooting. These delays reportedly increased the budget by $50 million to a total of $250 million, which Garcia disputed.[4] Johnson later admitted to frequent tardiness as well as urinating in bottles on set, but Evans and Kasdan defended him.[21][22] Red One was originally scheduled to be released on Prime Video worldwide in time for Christmas 2023.[23] The release was delayed from December 20, 2023, until November 15, 2024, due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, along with the film getting a worldwide theatrical release.[24][25] Johnson pushed for Red One to be released in IMAX after watching an IMAX screening of Oppenheimer while Red One's principal photography was still underway. Johnson thought that Red One in the IMAX format would be \"game over\".[26] Amazon MGM Studios handled the distribution in the United States, while Warner Bros. Pictures handled the film's international release.[27] In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it was released on November 6, 2024.[28] In Latin America, it was released on November 7, 2024.[29] with pre-release advance screenings starting October 31, 2024.[30] Footage of Red One was first shown at CinemaCon in April 2024 to journalists selected by Johnson's publicist, but they were not allowed to write about what they saw.[4] Red One was released on Prime Video on December 12, 2024. As of December 10, 2024[update], Red One has grossed $87.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $78.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $165.9 million.[6][5] In the United States and Canada, Red One was projected to gross $30‚Äì35 million from 4,032 theaters, with some independent sources predicting a debut as low as $25 million or as high as $40 million.[3][31] The film made $10.9 million on its first day, including $3.7 million from Sunday and Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $32.1 million, topping the box office.[2] Following the film's weak previews performance, Variety concluded that, \"With a massive budget of $250 million, plus marketing costs, it'll take a Christmas miracle for Red One to become a profitable hit at the box office.\"[32][33] In its second box office weekend, the film dropped 59% to $13.3 million, finishing in third behind newcomers Wicked and Gladiator II.[34] In its third weekend the film made $12.9 million (and a total of $18.7 million over the five day Thanksgiving frame), dropping just 2.5% from the previous weekend and finishing in fourth behind Gladiator ll, Wicked and Moana 2.[35] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 31% of 163 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.4/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Wrapped in slick packaging but wholly lacking in holiday magic, Red One is a ho-ho-hum action-adventure.\"[36] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 34 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable\" reviews.[37] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A‚Äì\" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled by PostTrak gave it a 78% overall positive score, with 57% saying they would definitely recommend it.[2] Peter Bradshaw, writing for The Guardian, gave the film one star out of five, describing it as \"profoundly depressing and blandly sentimental\" and concluding \"this commercial and formulaic slice of content is a toy destined to be forgotten, not by Boxing Day, but mid-November.\"[38] Glenn Garner of Deadline Hollywood said the film \"blends genres for some family-friendly holiday fun with a generous dose of self-aware absurdity\" and wrote: \"Yes, it's cheesy, but this movie is best when it leans heavily into the cheese. If that makes your eyes roll, keep in mind this is a Christmas movie ultimately intended for kids who've made it all the way through the MCU on Disney+ twice and their parents now need a reprieve. There are still some jokes aimed at the cold-hearted adult who will inevitably be dragged along on the family cinema outing.\"[39]",

From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department‚Äôs decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted. Without aggravating factors like use in a crime, multiple purchases, or buying a weapon as a straw purchaser, people are almost never brought to trial on felony charges solely for how they filled out a gun form. Those who were late paying their taxes because of serious addictions, but paid them back subsequently with interest and penalties, are typically given non-criminal resolutions. It is clear that Hunter was treated differently. The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election. Then, a carefully negotiated plea deal, agreed to by the Department of Justice, unraveled in the court room ‚Äì with a number of my political opponents in Congress taking credit for bringing political pressure on the process. Had the plea deal held, it would have been a fair, reasonable resolution of Hunter‚Äôs cases. No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter‚Äôs cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son ‚Äì and that is wrong. There has been an effort to break Hunter ‚Äì who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution. In trying to break Hunter, they‚Äôve tried to break me ‚Äì and there‚Äôs no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough. For my entire career I have followed a simple principle: just tell the American people the truth. They‚Äôll be fair-minded. Here‚Äôs the truth: I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice ‚Äì and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further. I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision. ### Executive Grant of ClemencyJoseph R.

The amnesty will be extended to roughly 1,500 people who were placed on home confinement during the COVID pandemic and 39 others who were convicted of nonviolent crimes, especially drug crimes, who have \"shown successful rehabilitation,\" according to a White House press release. Biden said in the statement he would \"take more steps in the weeks ahead\" and continue to review clemency petitions to advance \"equal justice under the law, promote public safety, support rehabilitation and reentry, and provide meaningful second chances.\" The White House said the pardoned individuals include a decorated military veteran, a nurse who helped spearhead vaccination efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic and an addiction counselor who volunteers to help young people. The actions come less than two weeks after Biden pardoned his son, Hunter, for gun and tax felonies, igniting bipartisan backlash. Pardons, explained: What is a presidential pardon?

The President is commuting the sentences of close to 1,500 individuals who were placed on home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic and who have successfully reintegrated into their families and communities. He is also pardoning 39 individuals who were convicted of non-violent crimes. These actions represent the largest single-day grant of clemency in modern history. Together, these actions build on the President‚Äôs record of criminal justice reform to help reunite families, strengthen communities, and reintegrate individuals back into society. The President has issued more sentence commutations at this point in his presidency than any of his recent predecessors at the same point in their first terms. He is also the first President ever to issue categorical pardons to individuals convicted of simple use and possession of marijuana, and to former LGBTQI+ service members convicted of private conduct because of their sexual orientation. In the coming weeks, the President will take additional steps to provide meaningful second chances and continue to review additional pardons and commutations. Americans receiving relief today include: As the President has said, the United States is a nation of second chances.

The nearly 1,500 individuals who received commutations today have been serving their sentences at home for at least one year under the COVID-era CARES Act. These Americans have been reunited with their families and shown their commitment to rehabilitation by securing employment and advancing their education. The 39 individuals receiving pardons today were convicted of non-violent crimes, including drug offenses, and have turned their lives around. These individuals are parents, veterans, health care professionals, teachers, advocates, and engaged members of their communities. Many of them have used their experiences in the criminal justice system to inspire and encourage others. Individual Clemency Actions Throughout the Biden-Harris Administration The President is intent on granting clemency to individuals convicted of non-violent crimes who were sentenced under outdated laws, policies, and practices that left them with longer sentences than if the individuals were sentenced today. To address these injustices, President Biden has taken several bold clemency actions throughout his Administration, including: These individual actions have helped to transform these individuals‚Äô lives and positively impact their communities. Federal convictions make it difficult to secure housing, jobs, educational opportunities, benefits, and health care; all essential to living a healthy and productive life. Through his use of the clemency power, President Biden has taken steps to unlock doors of opportunity that would have otherwise remained closed to these recipients, who deserve a second chance. Categorical Clemency Actions throughout the Biden-Harris Administration In addition to these individual clemency actions, President Biden has issued a number of categorical pardons to certain groups of people. The President has used categorical clemency more than any of his predecessors, which has allowed him to widely and systemically respond to historic injustices. His bold and unprecedented categorical actions, broadly outlined below, include the following: The President‚Äôs categorical approach to clemency has also inspired leaders across the country to take similar action. Over ten states and localities, including Maryland and Massachusetts, have issued categorical clemency for marijuana convictions, impacting hundreds of thousands of people and allowing individuals to move past their convictions and move on with their daily lives. While today‚Äôs announcement marks important progress, there is more to come. President Biden will continue to review clemency petitions and deliver criminal justice reform in a manner that advances equity and justice, promotes public safety, supports rehabilitation and reentry, and provides meaningful second chances. ### We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.

                "content": "Isaac Guerendo (born June 28, 2000)[1] is an American professional football running back for the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Wisconsin Badgers and Louisville Cardinals. Guerendo was born in Clayton, Indiana[2][3] and attended Avon High School in Avon, Indiana. In his junior season, Guerendo hauled in 19 receptions for 596 yards and six touchdowns.[4] Guerendo had a breakout senior season bringing in 54 receptions for 1,258 yards and 16 touchdowns.[5] As a senior, Guerendo was named the Indianapolis Star's Mister Football for wide receivers.[6][5] Coming out of high school, Guerendo decided to commit to play college football for the Wisconsin Badgers.[7][8] In Guerendo's first season in 2019, he carried the ball once for one yard, while also making one catch for three yards, and returning one kickoff for 49 yards.[9] In the COVID shortened 2020 season, Guerendo carried the ball 11 times for 36 yards.[10] In week two of the 2021 season, he recorded his first career touchdown on an 82-yard run versus Eastern Michigan.[11] Guerendo finished the 2021 season with 160 yards and a touchdown of 23 carries, while also racking up two receptions for six yards.[12] In 2022 he rushed for 385 yards and five touchdowns on 64 carries, while also notching 17 receptions for 115 yards and a touchdown.[13] After the conclusion of the 2022 season, Guerendo decided to enter the NCAA transfer portal.[14][15] Guerendo finished his Wisconsin Badger career playing in 20 games carrying the ball 99 times for 582 yards and six touchdowns, while also notching 20 receptions for 124 yards and a touchdown.[16] He graduated from Wisconsin in December 2022 with a bachelor's degree in personal finance.[17] In 2023, Guerendo became a graduate transfer to the University of Louisville, playing for the Louisville Cardinals for his final season of college eligibility.[18][19] In Guerendo's Louisville home debut in week two of the 2023 season, he rushed for 63 yards and a touchdown on 11 carries, while also hauling in four receptions for 47 yards.[20] In week ten of the 2023 season, Guerendo had a career performance rushing for 146 yards and three touchdowns in a win over Virginia Tech.[21] In the 2023 Holiday Bowl, Guerendo rushed for a career high 161 yards and three touchdowns, on 23 carries, but the Cardinals lost to USC 42‚Äì28.[22] Guerendo finished the 2023 season with 810 yards and 11 touchdowns on 132 carries, while also making 22 receptions for 234 yards.[23] After the conclusion of the 2023 season, Guerendo declared for the 2024 NFL draft.[24][25] Guerendo was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the 4th round (129th overall) of the 2024 NFL Draft.[28] In May, he signed a 4 year contract with the 49ers.[29] After injuries to running backs Christian McCaffrey and Jordan Mason,[30] he had some playing time, making his debut in week 2 against the Minnesota Vikings in a 23‚Äì17 loss.

Nearly every notable name on the offense has missed time at some point this season. The two most significant injuries were Brandon Aiyuk and Christian McCaffrey, who combined to appear in just 11 games and did not share the field for a single snap all year. The position group that has been hit the hardest has undoubtedly been running back. Starter Christian McCaffrey (knee) is amid his second IR stint, and his backup, Jordan Mason, is also on IR with a high-ankle sprain. With their top two options sidelined, the expectation was that rookie Isaac Guerendo would lead the backfield for the remainder of the regular season. Well, Guerendo suffered an injury of his own last week and is in danger of missing a Thursday night matchup with the Rams. WEEK 15 FANTASY FOOTBALL RANKINGSQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/ST | Kickers After spraining his foot last week, Guerendo has been labeled as day-to-day. After not practicing to open the week, he was upgraded to limited participation during Wednesday's practice. Following his spotty participation, the team has listed Gurendo as \"questionable\" for Thursday's game. 49ers ruled out LT Trent Williams (ankle) and S Malik Mustapha (chest, shoulder) for Thursday night‚Äôs game vs. the Rams.DE Nick Bosa (hip, oblique), RB Isaac Guerendo (foot) and LB Dre Greenlaw (Achilles) are listed as questionable. Considering Guerendo has not practiced in full at any point this week, it's truly a toss-up as to whether he'll be able to suit up. There's a decent chance his status is unknown until inactives are due 90 minutes before kickoff. Guerendo continues to maintain that he is going to play. He has been listed as questionable and will test his injury during pre-game warm-ups, but the notion in the morning is that the running back will play. With the fantasy football playoffs starting tonight:49ers rookie RB Isaac Guerendo plans to play Thursday night vs. the Rams despite his sprained foot that has left him being listed as questionable, per sources. Guerendo insists he ‚Äúfeels good.‚Äù pic.twitter.com/WClJ52lva3 Check back here often, as we'll be providing updates on Guerendo's status as they become available. Considering Guerendo is the RB3 in San Francisco, they'll be reaching deep down the depth chart if he's unable to play. When Guerendo left late in the game last week, the coaching staff turned to Patrick Taylor to close out the game. He'd likely function as the lead back in Guerendo's absence. If Guerendo is unable to play, don't be surprised if one (or both) of Ke'Shawn Vaughn or Israel Abanikanda mix in with Taylor to some degree. Both are relatively new to the team, but they could be used to spell Taylor throughout the game. Week 15 FANTASY FOOTBALL ROSTER MANAGEMENTLessons Learned | Stock Watch | Sleepers | Busts | Start 'Em, Sit 'Em | Usage Report Gurendo acted as a bell cow last week, ceding just one carry to Patrick Taylor before getting hurt, and he was incredibly effective in this role. Unsurprisingly, a running back with size (6-0, 221 pounds) and speed (4.33 40-yard dash) performed well in Kyle Shanahan's offense. The rookie finished with 26.8 PPR points on 17 touches and was set up to be a true league winner. Assuming Guerendo is able to play, he may be limited in some capacity, but he's well worth the start. His fantasy value as the 49ers' lead back was cemented last week. Otherwise, Patrick Taylor becomes a terrific spot start if Guerendo can't take the field. If you didn't pick up Taylor on waivers, be sure to consult the Sporting News' RB rankings and sleepers to find a worthwhile replacement for Guerendo.

                "content": "Rookie running back Isaac Guerendo left late in the fourth quarter of the 49ers' 38-13 win over the Chicago Bears with a foot injury, according to head coach Kyle Shanahan. The 49ers will learn the extent of it on Monday after Guerendo has an MRI. With 10:45 left in the game, Brock Purdy handed off to Guerendo, who ran behind left guard Spencer Burford for a gain of six yards, then hobbled off the field and did not return. Patrick Taylor Jr. and Ke'Shawn took the remainder of the carries and gained just 29 yards on 9 rushing attempts. The 49ers won big anyway. Guerendo was making his first career start after both Christian McCaffrey and Jordan Mason landed on the Injured Reserve list. Guerendo essentially was a backup running back in college -- he started just one game. So it was unclear how he would be able to carry the workload of a starting NFL running back. And for the most part, he did well. He averaged 5.2 yards per carry and scored two rushing touchdowns, plus he caught two passes for 50 yards. Which means he had 128 yards from scrimmage in his first career start. Not too shabby. Unfortunately for the 49ers, he went down in the fourth quarter when they were winning by 25 points. Perhaps he wasn't fully capable of being a bellcow running back. Now the 49ers may have to play the Rams this Thursday night without him. And if Guerendo can't play, the 49ers' chances of winning will be slim to none. Stay tuned. Download and follow The Cohn Zohn Podcast. Grant Cohn has covered the San Francisco 49ers daily since 2011.

                "content": "The phrase \"No good deed goes unpunished\" is a sardonic commentary on the frequency with which acts of kindness backfire on those who offer them. In other words, those who help others are doomed to suffer as a result of their helpfulness. The phrase is first attested in Walter Map's 12th-century De nugis curialium, in whose fourth chapter the character Eudo adhered to inverted morality \"left no good deed unpunished, no bad one unrewarded\".[1][2] Conventional moral wisdom holds that evil deeds are punished by divine providence and good deeds are rewarded by divine providence:[1] For as punishment is to the evil act, so is reward to a good act. Now no evil deed is unpunished, by God the just judge. Therefore no good deed is unrewarded, and so every good deed merits some good.[a] This is related to the concepts of Hell and of karma. The modern expression \"No good deed goes unpunished\" is an ironic twist on this conventional morality.[1] The ironic usage of the phrase appears to be[weasel words] a 20th-century invention, found for example in Brendan Gill's 1950 novel The Trouble of One House.[3] It is also featured prominently in the song \"No Good Deed\", from the 2003 hit Broadway musical Wicked.[4] A satirical poem by Franklin Pierce Adams with the title \"No Good Deed Goes Unpunished (So Shines a Good Deed in a Naughty World)\" also exists.[5] In 2005, author David Helvarg introduced the concept that the punishment may be a form of retaliation, in a piece he wrote for Grist Magazine, \"Remember that sign they hung up in an EPA office during the Reagan administration, 'No good deed goes unpunished'? Under George Bush, no good science goes unpunished.\"[6]",

I am sure that most of you have heard the old phrase, ‚ÄúNo good deed goes unpunished.‚Äù You also know by now that Ol‚Äô Dutch likes to include some background of the origin of such phrases here so that you, my readers, will have some intellectual-sounding fodder to bring up at the next social meeting you attend. So, I went to the source for everything, aka The Internet, and there seems to be some schism about who came up with such wisdom. One source swears up and down it was first attributed to old Walter Map's 12th-century De nugis curialium where a character is said to have, \"left no good deed unpunished, no bad one unrewarded\". But another search engine attests the phrase to one Oscar Wilde, a famous Irish poet and playwright born way back in 1854. Miss Trixie upon hearing his birthdate thought it pertinent to ask Ol‚Äô Dutch if he knew old Oscar since she thinks I may be older than dirt after my last birthday. Moving on, O.W. did say \"no good deed goes unpunished\" in its purest form so we will chalk one up for the Irish and let him have the credit this time. What it means is whenever a person does a good deed for someone just out of the abundance of their heart let us say, somehow the doer many times gets the short end of the deal. Take for instance one of your friends gets stranded in a broken-down car. You put on your Good Samaritan shirt and shoes, rush out there, spend all day helping them tow them to town. And that is all well and good but what can happen is while you are out there a truck goes by and dumps a whole passel of nails on the road and you end up ruining four tires. Now this does not mean you should curtail your good deeds as they may help you get in the Pearly Gates, if you are short on good conduct credits. So, Ol‚Äô Dutch found himself in the perfect spot ‚Äì so I thought ‚Äî to help some poor soul along life's highway last Sunday. Having shuttled some fishermen up the river, I decided that it was time for me to wet a line and went up to an area lake to fly fish the stream coming into it. I was doing good just minding my own business ‚Äì which I should have kept doing ‚Äì when two young boys began trying to fly fish beside me. It was a pathetic display of whipping and pounding the water and Ol‚Äô Dutch decided to teach them a few things about casting a fly. They were overjoyed to learn how to throw and soon I had them tossing loop after loop across the stream. And Ol‚Äô Dutch was feeling prouder than a peacock in Spring until I stepped back and fell into a hidden beaver den. Down I went sloshing and thrashing into the cold morass and looking to the boys for a hand up, but all I saw were four eyes staring back at this old man in total disbelief at what they were seeing. I did finally extract myself from the watery grave but not before filling both boots, all my pockets and my wallet with ice cold rocky mountain spring water. I do have to admit I laughed all the way back to the truck at the sight I must have been as I went down like a trap door had been pulled out from underneath me. It was the first time I have fallen in probably in 10 years, so I still feel pretty good about that, albeit a tad soggy. Last week was not all bad, as I was able to assist in the rescue of a woman from the river as my good deed and that deed had no bad payback. So, I guess I will keep trying to help others. My mother always told us that when you do a good turn for someone that God will repay you and so far, she has been right. And when you take that attitude then you never have to feel as though you got shorted in any situation. So, get out there this week and help a friend, neighbor, and if you are Godly enough, help an enemy. God keeps score, you can bet on that and who better to reward you for your deeds than Him.

                "content": "Voice of America (VOA or VoA) is an international broadcasting state media network funded by the federal government of the United States of America. It is the largest and oldest of the U.S. international broadcasters.[3][4][5] VOA produces digital, TV, and radio content in 48 languages, which it distributes to affiliate stations around the world.[6] Its targeted and primary audience is non-American outside of the US borders. As of November 2022, its reporting reached 326 million adults per week across all platforms.[7] It is financed by the U.S. Agency for Global Media after approval by Congress.[8] VOA was established in 1942, and the VOA charter was signed into law in 1976 by U.S. President Gerald Ford.[9][10] It is headquartered in Washington, D.C., and overseen by the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), an independent agency of the U.S. government.[11] Funds are appropriated annually under the budget for embassies and consulates. As of 2022, VOA had a weekly worldwide audience of approximately 326 million (up from 237 million in 2016) and employed 961 staff with an annual budget of $267.5 million.[1][12][13] The Voice of America website had five English-language broadcasts as of 2014 (worldwide, Learning English, Cambodia, Zimbabwe, and Tibet). Additionally, the VOA website has versions in 48 foreign languages.[14][1] Radio programs are marked with an \"R\"; TV programs with a \"T\": The number of languages varies according to the priorities of the United States government and the world situation.[15][16] Before World War II, all American shortwave radio stations were in private hands.[17] Privately controlled shortwave networks included the National Broadcasting Company's International Network (or White Network), which broadcast in six languages, the Columbia Broadcasting System's Latin American international network, which consisted of 64 stations located in 18 countries, the Crosley Broadcasting Corporation in Cincinnati, Ohio, and General Electric which owned and operated WGEO and WGEA, both based in Schenectady, New York, and KGEI in San Francisco, all of which had shortwave transmitters.[18][19] Experimental programming began in the 1930s, but there were fewer than 12 transmitters in operation.[20] In 1939, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission set the following policy, which was intended to enforce the US State Department's Good Neighbor Policy, but which some broadcasters felt was an attempt to direct censorship:[21] A licensee of an international broadcast station shall render only an international broadcast service which will reflect the culture of this country and which will promote international goodwill, understanding and cooperation. Any program solely intended for, and directed to an audience in the continental United States does not meet the requirements for this service.[22] Around 1940, shortwave signals to Latin America were regarded as vital to counter Nazi propaganda.[20] Initially, the US Office of the Coordinator of Information sent releases to each station, but this was seen as an inefficient means of transmitting news.[17] The director of Latin American relations at the Columbia Broadcasting System was Edmund A. Chester, and he supervised the development of CBS's extensive \"La Cadena de las Am√©ricas\" radio network to improve broadcasting to South America during the 1940s.[23] Even before the December 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. government's Office of the Coordinator of Information (COI) had already begun providing war news and commentary to the commercial American shortwave radio stations for use on a voluntary basis, through its Foreign Information Service (FIS) headed by playwright Robert E. Sherwood, who served as President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's speech writer and information advisor.[24] Direct programming began a week after the United States' entry into World War II in December 1941, with the first broadcast from the San Francisco office of the FIS via General Electric's KGEI transmitting to the Philippines in English (other languages followed). The next step was to broadcast to Germany, which was called Stimmen aus Amerika (\"Voices from America\") and was transmitted on February 1, 1942. It was introduced by the ‚ÄúBattle Hymn of the Republic\" and included the pledge: \"Today, and every day from now on, we will be with you from America to talk about the war... The news may be good or bad for us ‚Äì We will always tell you the truth.\"[25] Roosevelt approved this broadcast, which then-Colonel William J. Donovan (COI) and Sherwood (FIS) had recommended to him. It was Sherwood who actually coined the term \"The Voice of America\" to describe the shortwave network that began its transmissions on February 1, from 270 Madison Avenue in New York City. The Office of War Information, when organized in the middle of 1942, officially took over VOA's operations. VOA reached an agreement with the British Broadcasting Corporation to share medium-wave transmitters in Great Britain, and expanded into Tunis in North Africa and Palermo and Bari, Italy, as the Allies captured these territories. The OWI also set up the American Broadcasting Station in Europe.[26] Asian transmissions started with one transmitter in California in 1941; services were expanded by adding transmitters in Hawaii and, after recapture, the Philippines.[27] By the end of the war, VOA had 39 transmitters and provided service in 40 languages.[27] Programming was broadcast from production centers in New York and San Francisco, with more than 1,000 programs originating from New York. Programming consisted of music, news, commentary, and relays of U.S. domestic programming, in addition to specialized VOA programming.[28] About half of VOA's services, including the Arabic service, were discontinued in 1945.[29] In late 1945, VOA was transferred to the US Department of State. Also included among the cultural diplomacy programming on the Columbia Broadcasting System was the musical show Viva America (1942‚Äì49) which featured the Pan American Orchestra and the artistry of several noted musicians from both North and South America, including Alfredo Antonini, Juan Arvizu, Eva Garza, Elsa Miranda, Nestor Mesta Chaires, Miguel Sandoval, John Serry Sr., and Terig Tucci.[30][31][32] By 1945, broadcasts of the show were carried by 114 stations on CBS's \"La Cadena de las Am√©ricas\" network in 20 Latin American nations. These broadcasts proved to be highly successful in supporting President Roosevelt's policy of Pan-Americanism throughout South America during World War II.[33] The VOA ramped up its operations during the Cold War.[34] Foy Kohler, the director of VOA from 1949 to 1952, strongly believed that the VOA was serving its purpose, which he identified as aiding in the fight against communism.[35] He argued that the numbers of listeners they were getting such as 194,000 regular listeners in Sweden, and 2.1 million regular listeners in France, was an indication of a positive impact. As further evidence, he noted that the VOA received 30,000 letters a month from listeners all over the world, and hundreds of thousands of requests for broadcasting schedules.[36] There was an analysis done of some of those letters sent in 1952 and 1953 while Kohler was still director. The study found that letter writing could be an indicator of successful, actionable persuasion. It was also found that broadcasts in different countries were having different effects. In one country, regular listeners adopted and practiced American values presented by the broadcast. Age was also a factor: younger and older audiences tended to like different types of programs, no matter the country.[37] Kohler used all of this as evidence to claim that the VOA helped to grow and strengthen the free world. It also influenced the UN in their decision to condemn communist actions in Korea, and was a major factor in the decline of communism in the \"free world, including key countries such as Italy and France.[35] In Italy, the VOA did not just bring an end to communism, but it caused the country to Americanize.[38] The VOA also had an impact behind the Iron Curtain. Practically all defectors during Kohler's time said that the VOA helped in their decision to defect.[39] Another indication of impact, according to Kohler, was the Soviet response. Kohler argued that the Soviets responded because the VOA was having an impact. Based on Soviet responses, it can be presumed that the most effective programs were ones that compared the lives of those behind and outside the Iron Curtain, questions on the practice of slave labor, as well as lies and errors in Stalin's version of Marxism.[35] In 1947, VOA started broadcasting to the Soviet citizens in Russia under the pretext of countering \"more harmful instances of Soviet propaganda directed against American leaders and policies\" on the part of the internal Soviet Russian-language media, according to John B. Whitton's treatise, Cold War Propaganda.[40] The Soviet Union responded by initiating electronic jamming of VOA broadcasts on April 24, 1949.[40] Charles W. Thayer headed VOA in 1948‚Äì49.[41] Over the next few years, the U.S. government debated the best role of Voice of America. The decision was made to use VOA broadcasts as a part of U.S. foreign policy to fight the propaganda of the Soviet Union and other countries. The Arabic service resumed on January 1, 1950, with a half-hour program. This program grew to 14.5 hours daily during the Suez Crisis of 1956, and was six hours a day by 1958.[29] Between 1952 and 1960, Voice of America used a converted U.S. Coast Guard cutter Courier as a first mobile broadcasting ship.[42] Control of VOA passed from the State Department to the U.S. Information Agency when the latter was established in 1953[29] to transmit worldwide, including to the countries behind the Iron Curtain and to the People's Republic of China. From 1955 until 2003, VOA broadcast American jazz on the Voice of America Jazz Hour. Hosted for most of that period by Willis Conover, the program had 30 million listeners at its peak. A program aimed at South Africa in 1956 broadcast two hours nightly, and special programs such as The Newport Jazz Festival were also transmitted. This was done in association with tours by U.S. musicians, such as Dizzy Gillespie, Louis Armstrong, and Duke Ellington, sponsored by the State Department.[43] From August 1952 through May 1953, Billy Brown, a high school senior in Westchester County, New York, had a Monday night program in which he shared everyday happenings in Yorktown Heights, New York. Brown's program ended due to its popularity: his \"chatty narratives\" attracted so much fan mail, VOA couldn't afford the $500 a month in clerical and postage costs required to respond to listeners' letters.[44] During 1953, VOA personnel were subjected to McCarthyist policies, where VOA was accused by Senator Joseph McCarthy, Roy Cohn, and Gerard David Schine of intentionally planning to build weak transmitting stations to sabotage VOA broadcasts. However, the charges were dropped after one month of court hearings in February and March 1953.[45] Sometime around 1954, VOA's headquarters were moved from New York to Washington D.C. The arrival of cheap, low-cost transistors enabled the significant growth of shortwave radio listeners. During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, VOA's broadcasts were deemed controversial, as Hungarian refugees and revolutionaries thought that VOA served as a medium and insinuated the possible arrival of the Western aid.[46] Throughout the Cold War, many of the targeted countries' governments sponsored jamming of VOA broadcasts, which sometimes led critics to question the broadcasts' actual impact. For example, in 1956, Polish People's Republic stopped jamming VOA transmissions,[47] but People's Republic of Bulgaria continued to jam the signal through the 1970s. In 1966 Edward R. Murrow said that: \"The Russians spend more money jamming the Voice of America than we have to spend for the entire program of the entire Agency. They spend about $125 million ($1,200,000,000 in current dollar terms) a year jamming it.\"[48] Chinese-language VOA broadcasts were jammed beginning in 1956 and extending through 1976.[49] However, after the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union, interviews with participants in anti-Soviet movements verified the effectiveness of VOA broadcasts in transmitting information to socialist societies.[50] The People's Republic of China diligently jams VOA broadcasts.[51] Cuba has also been reported to interfere with VOA satellite transmissions to Iran from its Russian-built transmission site at Bejucal.[52] David Jackson, former director of Voice of America, noted: \"The North Korean government doesn't jam us, but they try to keep people from listening through intimidation or worse. But people figure out ways to listen despite the odds. They're very resourceful.\"[53] Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, VOA covered some of the era's most important news, including Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 \"I Have a Dream\" speech[55] and Neil Armstrong's 1969 first walk on the Moon, which drew an audience estimated at between 615 and 750 million people. In 1973, due to the d√©tente policies in the Cold War, Soviet jamming of the VOA ceased; it restarted in 1979.[56] In the early 1980s, VOA began a $1.3 billion rebuilding program to improve broadcast with better technical capabilities. During the implementation of the Martial law in Poland between 1981 and 1983, VOA's Polish broadcasts expanded to seven hours daily. Throughout the 1980s, VOA focused on covering events from the 'American hinterland', such as 150th anniversary of the Oregon Trail.[45] Also in the 1980s, VOA also added a television service, as well as special regional programs to Cuba, Radio Mart√≠ and TV Mart√≠. Cuba has consistently attempted to jam such broadcasts and has vociferously protested U.S. broadcasts directed at Cuba. In September 1980, VOA started broadcasting to Afghanistan in Dari and in Pashto in 1982.[57] In 1981, VOA opened a bureau in Beijing, China.[58] The next year, it began regular exchanges with Radio Peking.[58] In 1985, VOA Europe was created as a special service in English that was relayed via satellite to AM, FM, and cable affiliates throughout Europe. With a contemporary format including live disc jockeys, the network presented top musical hits as well as VOA news and features of local interest (such as \"EuroFax\") 24 hours a day. VOA Europe was closed down without advance public notice in January 1997 as a cost-cutting measure.[59] It was followed by VOA Express, which from July 4, 1999, revamped into VOA Music Mix.[60] Since November 1, 2014, stations are offered VOA1 (which is a rebranding of VOA Music Mix).[61] In 1989, Voice of America expanded its Mandarin and Cantonese programming to reach the millions of Chinese and inform the country about the pro-democracy movement within the country, including the demonstration in Tiananmen Square.[62] Starting in 1990, the U.S. consolidated its international broadcasting efforts, with the establishment of the Bureau of Broadcasting.[63] With the breakup of the Soviet bloc in Eastern Europe, VOA added many additional language services to reach those areas. This decade was marked by the additions of services in Standard Tibetan, Kurdish (to Iran and Iraq), Serbo-Croatian (Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian), Macedonian, and Rwanda-Rundi.[64][65] In 1993, the Clinton administration advised cutting funding for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, as it believed post-Cold War information and influence was not needed in Europe. This plan was not well received, and US President Bill Clinton then proposed the compromise of the International Broadcasting Act, which he signed into law in 1994. This law established the International Broadcasting Bureau as a part of the United States Information Agency (USIA), and established the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) with oversight authority, which took control from the Board for International Broadcasters which previously had overseen funding for RFE/RL.[66] In 1998, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act was signed into law, and mandated that the BBG become an independent federal agency as of October 1, 1999. This act also abolished the USIA, and merged most of its functions into those of the State Department.[67] In 1994, Voice of America became the first broadcast-news organization to offer continuously updated programs on the Internet.[68] The Arabic Service was abolished in 2002 and replaced by a new radio service, called the Middle East Radio Network or Radio Sawa, with an initial budget of $22 million. Radio Sawa offered mostly Western and Middle Eastern popular songs with periodic brief news bulletins. The Arabic Service expanded to television with Alhurra on February 14, 2004 (and later to various social media and websites).[69] On May 16, 2004, the US government's international English language TV service Worldnet, became part of VOA as \"VOA TV\". Radio programs in Russian ended in July 2008.[70] In September 2008, VOA eliminated the Hindi-language service after 53 years.[70] Broadcasts in Ukrainian, Serbian, Macedonian, and Bosnian also ended.[71] These reductions were part of American efforts to concentrate more resources to broadcast to the Muslim world.[70][71] In September 2010, VOA began radio broadcasts in Sudan. As U.S. interests in South Sudan grew, there was a desire to provide people with free information.[72] In 2013, VOA ended foreign-language transmissions on shortwave and medium wave to Albania, Georgia, Iran, and Latin America, as well as English-language broadcasts to the Middle East and Afghanistan.[73] This was done due to budget cuts.[73] On July 1, 2014, VOA cut most of its English-language transmissions to Asia,[74] as well as shortwave transmissions in Azerbaijani, Bengali, Khmer, Kurdish, Lao, and Uzbek.[74] The following month, the Greek service ended after 72 years on air.[75][76] RFE/RL launched the Russian language Current Time TV, in October 2014.[77] In January 2016, upon his arrival in Moscow, Russian authorities detained and then deported Jeff Shell, the Chairman of the Broadcasting Board of Governors that oversees the Voice of America, despite his having a valid Russian visa.[78] Russian authorities did not explain their actions.[78] Round-the-clock broadcasting of Current Time began on February 7, 2017.[79][80][81] In December 2017, under a new directive from Russia's Kremlin after a new law was passed by the State Duma (Russia's lower house of parliament) and the upper house Federation Council and signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin, Voice of America was deemed a \"foreign agent\" under the Russian foreign agent law.[82][83] In June 2021, the Russian news agency TASS reported that Russia's state communications watchdog Roskomnadzor complained that the foreign agent Voice of America radio station challengingly refused to observe Russian law because it had not established a Russian legal entity.[84] Roskomnadzor also said that VOA was as a foreign agent \"obliged to mark their content and provide information about all aspects of their activity, including a detailed description of contacts with the authorities.\"[84] In March 2022, VOA and other news broadcasters, including the BBC, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and Deutsche Welle were blocked in Russia,[85] as after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russian authorities increased censorship of independent journalism, anti-war protests, and dissenting voices.[86][87][88][89] Nevertheless, many Russians have used VPNs and other software to get around Russian government blocks.[90][91] As of March 2022, VOA broadcasts were reaching people in Russia and the region through TV, FM and medium wave radio, digital, and direct-to-home satellite.[89] In May 2023, Russia banned acting VOA chief Yolanda Lopez from ever entering the country.[92] The current director, Michael Abramowitz, assumed the position in July 2024. He previously served as president of Freedom House and spent nearly 25 years as a reporter and editor for The Washington Post.[93] In December 2024, president-elect Trump announced he would be picking former news anchor Kari Lake to be the director of VOA.[94] Voice of America has been a part of several agencies. From its founding in 1942 to 1945, it was part of the Office of War Information, and then from 1945 to 1953 as a function of the State Department. VOA was placed under the U.S. Information Agency in 1953. When the USIA was abolished in 1999, VOA was placed under the BBG which is an autonomous U.S. government agency, with bipartisan membership. The Secretary of State has a seat on the BBG.[95] The BBG was established as a buffer to protect VOA and other U.S.-sponsored, non-military, international broadcasters from political interference. It replaced the Board for International Broadcasting (BIB) that oversaw the funding and operation of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, a branch of VOA.[66] In 2021, Voice of America launched 52 Documentary, a series that publishes weekly films about human experiences.[96] The series is presented on the streaming app, VOA+, and YouTube. Films average 10‚Äì15 minutes and are translated with captions in several languages, including Russian, Persian, Mandarin, Urdu, and English. Euna Lee directs the program.[97] From 1948 until its amendment in 2013, Voice of America was forbidden to broadcast directly to American citizens, pursuant to ¬ß 501 of the Smith‚ÄìMundt Act.[98] The intent of the 1948 legislation was to protect the American public from propaganda by its own government and to avoid any competition with private American companies.[99] The act was amended via the passage of the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act provision of the National Defense Authorization Act for 2013.[100] The amendment was intended to adapt the law to the Internet and to allow American citizens access to VOA content.[101] Under the Eisenhower administration in 1959, VOA Director Henry Loomis commissioned a formal statement of principles to protect the integrity of VOA programming and define the organization's mission, and was issued by Director George V. Allen as a directive in 1960 and was endorsed in 1962 by USIA director Edward R. Murrow.[102] VOA's charter was signed into law by President Gerald Ford.[3]: 218 VOA's charter requires it to \"present the policies of the United States clearly and effectively.\"[103]: 218 Academics including T√©wodros W. Workneh have described this as a public diplomacy function.[103]: 218 VOA's charter also requires it to be \"a reliable and authoritative source of news\" which \"shall be accurate, objective, and comprehensive\".[103]: 218 The Voice of America Firewall was put in place with the 1976 VOA Charter and laws passed in 1994 and 2016 as a way of ensuring the integrity of VOA's journalism. This policy fights against propaganda and promotes unbiased and objective journalistic standards in the agency. The charter is one part of this firewall and the other laws assist in ensuring high standards of journalism.[104][105] According to former VOA correspondent Alan Heil, the internal policy of VOA News is that any story broadcast must have two independently corroborating sources or have a staff correspondent witness an event.[106] VOA Radiogram was an experimental Voice of America program that started in March 2013 and ended in June 2017, which transmitted digital text and images via shortwave radiograms.[107][108] There were 220 editions of the program, transmitted each weekend from the Edward R. Murrow transmitting station. The audio tones that comprised the bulk of each 30-minute program were transmitted via an analog transmitter, and could be decoded using a basic AM shortwave receiver with freely downloadable software of the Fldigi family. This software was available for Windows, macOS, Linux, and FreeBSD systems. Broadcasts could also be decoded using the free TIVAR app from the Google Play store using any Android device. The mode used most often on VOA Radiogram, for both text and images, was MFSK32, but other modes were also occasionally transmitted. The final edition of VOA Radiogram was transmitted during the weekend of June 17‚Äì18, 2017, a week before the retirement of the program producer from VOA. An offer to continue the broadcasts on a contract basis was declined, so a follow-on show called Shortwave Radiogram began transmission on June 25, 2017, from the WRMI transmitting site in Okeechobee, Florida.[109][110] The Bethany Relay Station, operational from 1944 to 1994, was based on a 625-acre (2.53 km2) site in Union Township (now West Chester Township) in Butler County, Ohio, near Cincinnati.[112] Major transmitter upgrades first were undertaken around 1963, when shortwave and medium-wave transmitters were built, upgraded, or rebuilt.[45] The site is now a recreational park with a Voice of America museum. Other former sites include California (Dixon and Delano), Hawaii, Okinawa, Liberia (Monrovia), Costa Rica, Belize, and at least two in Greece (Kavala and Rhodos). Between 1983 and 1990, VOA made significant upgrades to transmission facilities in Botswana (Selebi-Phikwe), Morocco, Thailand (Udon Thani), Kuwait, and S√£o Tom√© (Almas).[113] Some of them are shared with Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia. VOA and USAGM continue to operate shortwave radio transmitters and antenna farms at International Broadcasting Bureau Greenville Transmitting Station (known as \"Site B\") in the United States, close to Greenville, North Carolina. They do not use FCC-issued call signs, since the FCC does not regulate communications by other federal government agencies. The International Broadcasting Bureau also operates transmission facilities on S√£o Tom√© and Tinang, Concepcion, Tarlac, Philippines for VOA.[114] Kosovo Republic of Kosovo (2008‚Äìpresent) On June 12, 2024, the House Foreign Affairs Committee concluded that there was \"credible evidence of corruption\" regarding the matter of Setareh Derakhshesh Sieg, the former director of Voice of America's Persian News Network (PNN).[116] Following a series of whistleblower complaints and an extensive internal investigation by civil servants, Sieg had been terminated in January 2021 for falsifying her education credentials, severe abuses of taxpayer dollars for personal benefit, and engaging in a pattern of favoritism that materially benefitted some employees and contractors at the expense of the public.[117] However, within hours after President Biden took office, Sieg was reinstated then transferred to a different role by then-acting VOA Director Yolanda Lopez and cleared of wrongdoing.[118] Lopez abruptly resigned in September 2023 as the Committee intensified its investigation.[119] In its June 2024 report, the Committee found that the original allegations had merit and were supported by substantial evidence.[120] Sieg remains employed at VOA. On April 2, 2007, Abdul Malik Rigi, the leader of Jundullah, an Iranian Muslim Sunni Salafi militant group with possible links to al-Qaeda, appeared on Voice of America's Persian-language service. The interview was condemned by the Iranian government.[121][122] Jundullah was linked to attacks on both Iranian military and civilians.[123][124] Rigi was captured by the Iranian security services and executed in 2010 in Evin Prison in Tehran.[125][126] In February 2013, a documentary released by China Central Television interviewed a Tibetan alleged self-immolator who failed to kill himself. The interviewee said he was motivated by Voice of America's broadcasts of commemorations of people who committed suicide in political self-immolation. VOA denied instigating self-immolations and demanded that the Chinese station retract its report.[127] After the January 2017 inauguration of US President Donald Trump, tweets by Voice of America (one of which was later removed) seemed to support the widely criticized statements by White House press secretary Sean Spicer about the crowd size and biased media coverage. This raised concerns over possible attempts by Trump to politicize VOA.[128][129][130][131] This amplified already growing propaganda concerns over the provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, signed into law by Barack Obama, which gave the powers of the board of the Broadcasting Board of Governors, which was relegated to an advisory role, to a CEO appointed by the president. Trump sent two of his political aides to the agency to aid its CEO during the transition to the Trump administration. Criticism was raised over Trump's choice of aides; Matthew Schuck was a staff writer for right-wing website The Daily Surge until 2015, while Matthew Ciepielowski was a field director at the conservative libertarian advocacy group Americans for Prosperity.[128] VOA officials responded with assurances that they would not become \"Trump TV\".[128] BBG head John F. Lansing told NPR that it would be illegal for the administration to tell VOA what to broadcast, while VOA director Amanda Bennett stressed that while \"government-funded\", the agency is not \"government-run\".[130] On April 10, 2020, the White House published an article in its daily newsletter critical of VOA coverage of the coronavirus pandemic.[132] Emails revealed in a Freedom of Information Act request showed Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) press official Michawn Rich had sent a memo to agency employees stating in part, \"as a rule, do not send up [interview] requests for [VOA contributor] Greta Van Susteren or anyone affiliated with Voice of America\", referencing the White House story.[133] On April 30, The Washington Post, referring to Steven L. Herman who covered the White House for VOA, reported Vice President Mike Pence's office \"threatened to retaliate against a reporter who revealed that Pence's office had told journalists they would need masks for Pence's visit to the Mayo Clinic ‚Äì a requirement Pence himself did not follow.\"[134] On June 3, 2020, the US Senate confirmed Michael Pack, a conservative documentaries filmmaker and close ally of Steve Bannon, to serve as head of the US Agency for Global Media, which oversees VOA.[135] Subsequently, Director Bennet and deputy director Sandy Sugawara resigned from VOA. CNN reported on June 16 that plans for a leadership shakeup at VOA were being discussed, including the possibility that controversial former White House aide Sebastian Gorka would be given a leadership role at VOA.[136] On June 17, the heads of VOA's Middle East Broadcasting, Radio Free Asia, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and the Open Technology Fund were all fired, their boards were dissolved, and external communications from VOA employees were made to require approval from senior agency personnel in what one source described as an \"unprecedented\" move, while Jeffrey Scott Shapiro, like Pack a Bannon ally, was rumored to be in line to head the Office of Cuba Broadcasting.[137] Four former members of the advisory boards filed suit challenging Pack's standing to fire them.[138] On July 9, NPR reported VOA would not renew the work visas of dozens of non-resident reporters, many of whom could face repercussions in their home countries.[139] In late July, four contractors and the head of VOA's Urdu-language service were suspended after a video featuring extensive clips from a Muslim-American voter conference, including a campaign message from then-Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, was determined not to meet editorial standards and taken down.[140] On August 12, 2020, USAGM chief financial officer Grant Turner and general counsel David Kligerman were removed from their positions and stripped of their security clearances, reportedly for their opposition to what Turner called \"gross mismanagement\", along with four other senior agency officials.[141] Politico reported on August 13 that Trump administration official and former shock jock Frank Wuco had been hired as a USAGM senior advisor, responsible for auditing the agency's office of policy and research.[142] As a radio host, Wuco issued insults and groundless claims against former US President Barack Obama, CIA Director John O. Brennan, and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.[143] VOA's Twitter account during this period featured stories favorable to Vice President Mike Pence and White House advisor Ivanka Trump.[144] In response to Pack's August 27 interview with The Federalist website, a group of VOA journalists sent a letter to VOA Acting Director Elez Biberaj complaining that Pack's \"comments and decisions 'endanger the personal security of VOA reporters at home and abroad, as well as threatening to harm U.S. national security objectives.'\"[145] VOA's response was that \"it would not respond directly to the letter because it was 'improper' and 'failed to follow procedure.' Instead, the leadership of USAGM and VOA 'are handling the choice of complaint transmission as an administrative issue,' which suggested that the journalists could face sanctions for their letter,\" according to The Washington Post. In the same story, the Post reported that VOA Spanish-language service White House correspondent's Brigo Segovia's interview with an official about the administration's response to Pack's personnel and other moves had been censored and his own access to VOA's computer system restricted.[146] On July 20, 2020, District of Columbia attorney general Karl A. Racine filed suit under the District's Nonprofit Corporations Act to reverse Pack's replacement of the Open Technology Fund (OTF) board.[147] Beginning in August 2020, OTF came under increasing pressure from Peck and USAGM leadership. According to Axios,[148][149] this was related to OTF's reluctance to extend grants to Falun Gong-related enterprises working on technology directed against China's Great Firewall; The New York Times noted Falun Gong and its Epoch Times media group frequently supported the Trump administration.[150] On August 18, USAGM announced it was setting up its own Office of Internet Freedom with less strict grant requirements and began soliciting OTF's grantees to apply to the new office.[151][152] On August 20, OTF sued USAGM in the US Court for Federal Claims for withholding nearly $20 million in previously agreed grant funds.[153] On October 15, summary judgment was granted nullifying Pack's attempt to replace the OTF board.[154] On September 29, six senior USAGM officials filed a whistleblower complaint in which they alleged that Pack or one of his aides had ordered research conducted into the voting history of at least one agency employee, which would be a violation of laws protecting civil servants from undue political influence.[155] NPR reported that two Pack aides had compiled a report on VOA White House bureau chief Steven L. Herman's social media postings and other writings in an attempt to charge him with a conflict of interest, and that the agency released a conflict of interest policy stating in part that a \"journalist who on Facebook 'likes' a comment or political cartoon that aggressively attacks or disparages the President must recuse themselves from covering the President.\"[156] A preliminary injunction issued on November 20 barred Pack \"from making personnel decisions involving journalists at the networks; from directly communicating with editors and journalists employed by them; and from investigating any editors or news stories produced by them,\" and characterized the investigation of Herman as an \"unconstitutional prior restraint\" of his, his editors', and fellow journalists' free speech.[157] Suspended officials from Voice of America sued the agency news outlet on October 8. They accused Pack of using Voice of America as a vehicle to promote the personal agenda of President Trump and of violating a statutory firewall intended to prevent political interference with the agency, and they sought their reinstatement.[158] In June 2020, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's campaign told Vox News that Biden would fire Pack if Biden won election.[159] In November 2020, US District Court Judge Beryl Howell found Pack violated the First Amendment rights of Voice of America journalists.[160] In December 2020, The Washington Post reported that Pack was refusing to cooperate with President-elect Biden's transition team and, in an end run around the court order, had persuaded VOA Acting Director Biberaj to step down, replacing him with Robert Reilly, a former VOA director who had written critically of Muslims, gays, and lesbians.[161][162] On December 19, 33 days before President-elect Biden's inauguration, Pack named Ted Lipien, a former VOA veteran journalist who headed the Polish Service during the final struggle for democracy in Poland in the 1980s and a former acting associate director of VOA who, according to NPR, \"became a sharp critic of USAGM, VOA and the other affiliated networks on a pair of blogs\" and \"of the three network presidents affected, the only one without established partisan ties,\" as head of RFE/RL, and Jeffrey Scott Shapiro, a writer for Breitbart and The Washington Times who had claimed President Obama \"hates America,\" as head of the Office of Cuba Broadcasting.[163][164][165][166] On December 30, NPR reported Pack was attempting to add contractual language that would make it impossible to fire the broadcasting board members he had installed for two years, after which they could only be fired \"for cause.\" Reportedly the new contracts were withdrawn after inquiries from media and Congress.[167] On January 11, 2021, VOA interim director Reilly ordered veteran reporter Patsy Widakuswara off the White House beat. Earlier that day, Widakuswara had followed US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo out of the building after his speech criticizing the VOA[168] and his VOA-sponsored interview with VOA Director Robert Reilly during which reporters were not allowed to ask questions.[169] Widakuswara asked Pompeo what he was doing to repair the international reputation of the U.S. and whether he regretted saying there would be a second Trump administration.[170][171] The theme of the preceding interview with VOA Director Robert Reilly was reportedly the dangers of censorship.[172] In response, dozens of VOA journalists, including Widakuswara, wrote and circulated a petition calling on Reilly and public affairs specialist Elizabeth Robbins to resign.[173] In a statement, U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Gregory Meeks and ranking member Michael McCaul said, \"Absent a legitimate reason for this move, which has not been provided, we believe she should be reinstated\".[169] Widakuswara was reinstated to the White House beat after President Biden requested the resignation of Michael Pack.[168] On January 19, the nonprofit Government Accountability Project, representing fired USAGM employees and whistleblowers, sent a letter to the congressional foreign affairs committees, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, and the Inspector General of the US Department of State. The letter said that Pack had hired the McGuireWoods law firm to investigate USAGM employees and the OTF at a cost of over $2 million in the last quarter of 2020, bypassing US government investigators including USAGM's own Office of Human Resources, and called for further investigation of what it termed a gross misuse of taxpayer dollars.[174] The Washington Post later reported that a second law firm, Caplin & Drysdale, had also been granted a similar no-bid contract in possible violation of federal contracting regulations for a total cost of $4 million.[175] Also on January 19, the last full day of the Trump presidency, Pack named a slate of five directors to head each of the three USAGM boards for RFE/RL, Radio Free Asia, and Middle East Broadcasting Networks: conservative radio talk show host Blanquita Cullum, Liberty Counsel officer Johnathan Alexander, former White House staffer Amanda Milius, conservative writer Roger Simon, and Center for the National Interest Fellow Christian Whiton.[176] The following day, Pack resigned at the request of the Biden administration.[177] On January 21, Shapiro resigned from the Office of Cuba Broadcasting. Biden named veteran VOA journalist Kelu Chao to replace Pack. Chao in turn dismissed Riley and Robbins from VOA, naming Yolanda Lopez, another VOA veteran, as acting director; Lopez had also been reassigned in the wake of the Pompeo interview.[178] On January 22, the Biden administration fired Victoria Coates and her deputy Robert Greenway from the Middle East Broadcasting Networks, naming Kelley Sullivan as acting head.[179][180] On April 19, 2017, the VOA Mandarin Service interviewed Chinese real estate tycoon Guo Wengui in a live broadcast. The government of China warned VOA representatives not to interview Guo about his \"unsubstantiated allegations\".[181][182] The interview was scheduled by the team for 3 hours. After Guo alleged that he had evidence of corruption among the members of the Politburo Standing Committee of China, the highest political authority of China, the interview was abruptly cut off by VOA leadership, after one hour and 17 minutes. Guo's allegations involved Fu Zhenhua and Wang Qishan (a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, and the leader of the anti-graft movement).[183] On August 27, four U.S. Congressmen requested that the Office of Inspector General (OIG) conduct an investigation into the interruption.[184] The OIG investigation concluded that the VOA leadership decision to curtail the Guo interview was based solely on journalistic best practices, rather than due to any pressure from the Chinese government.[185] Another investigation, by Mark Feldstein, Chair of Broadcast Journalism at the University of Maryland, College Park, concluded that \"VOA‚Äôs senior management did its best to make decisions consistent with journalism‚Äôs best practices and industry standards,‚Äù and ‚Äúwas not improperly influenced by the Chinese government or anyone else. The failure [of the VOA Mandarin Service interview team] to comply with leadership's instructions during the Guo interview 'was a colossal and unprecedented violation of journalistic professionalism and broadcast industry standards.'\"[185] The Feldstein report also noted that \"There had been a grossly negligent approach\" by the VOA Mandarin Service interview team to pre-interview vetting, and failure to \"corroborate the authenticity of Guo's evidence or interview other sources,\" in violation of industry standards. The VOA Mandarin Service interview team apparently \"demonstrated greater loyalty to its source than to its employer ‚Äì at the expense of basic journalistic standards of accuracy, verification, and fairness,\" the Feldstein report concluded.[186][187] It has been reported that a Voice of America relay station in Udon Thani Province, Thailand was used as a CIA black site referred to as \"Cat's Eye\" or \"Detention Site Green\".[188][189] The Amharic Service was started in 1982.[190] From 1982 to 1986, the VOA service had a mix of staff consisting of former members of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Party (EPRP) and US-educated staff without strong political involvement in the 1974 Ethiopian Revolution and the associated student movement of the revolutionary period. Reporting was mostly critical of the Derg led by Mengistu Haile Mariam.[190] The 1986 to 1996 phase was according to Annette Sheckler, who became head of the VOA Horn of Africa Service in December 1998, opposed to the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF)/Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), which took control of Ethiopia in 1991. According to Sheckler, the reporting became more politicized due to the loss of qualified staff, the role of EPRP-supporting staff being opposed to the TPLF government, and the role of former Derg officials who were recruited to the Service. US ambassadors to Ethiopia Mark Bass, Irvin Hicks, and David Shinn objected to what they saw as a lack of balance in the Service. Sheckler believed the Chief of the Horn of Africa service's EPRP background was a factor in what she viewed as imbalanced reporting. Broadcasts in Tigrinya and Oromo were added in addition to Amhara.[190] Sheckler sees the 18-month period during 1996‚Äì98, with a new temporary service Chief, as having become \"essentially ungovernable\" with a \"legacy of personal animosity, hostility and complete lack of professionalism\".[190] Sheckler described the June 1998 phase of the Eritrean‚ÄìEthiopian War as exacerbating ethnic conflicts within the service. Sheckler wrote memos to VOA leadership describing her assessment of serious problems in the service, and was fired on November 20, 1998, officially for \"a lack of professional journalistic ethics\"; she describes the reason for her firing as \"telling the truth\".[190] Peter Heinlein led the service from 2012 to 2014. In 2013, he wrote a complaint about his view of problems in the service. He saw a significant flaw being the confusion of roles in which translators, untrained in the principles and methods of journalism, took on the role of journalists.[191] The service was mostly seen as anti-Ethiopian government until 2018, when Negussie Mengesha, the head of the VOA Africa division for several years, met the newly appointed Ethiopian prime minister Abiy Ahmed.[191] In May 2021, several former employees accused VOA's Amharic service, under the leadership of Negussie Mengesha, of being biased in favor of the government of Abiy Ahmed, including failing to report on atrocities committed during the Tigray War.[192] VOA journalist Jason Patinkin said that he had reported the problems \"at every level of the VOA hierarchy\". Patinkin resigned from the service, saying that VOA had \"sided with the perpetrators both by commission and omission\" of \"potential crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing and perhaps even genocide\".[191] In June 2021, Mail & Guardian reported on an investigation based on \"hundreds of internal memos and interviews with about a dozen former and current members\" of the VOA Horn of Africa service.[191] Mail & Guardian stated that during the Tigray War, the only major foreign news service that was not harassed by Ethiopian security services was VOA. VOA gave frequent coverage to the Mai Kadra massacre, mostly attributed to Tigrayan youth and documented by Amnesty International, while later focusing on the Ethiopian government's dismissal of Amnesty International's report on the Axum massacre rather than on the methods and content of the report itself. During 107 meetings of the Horn of Africa service from November 4, 2020, to April 30, 2021, during the Tigray War, most (81%) of the meetings did not have approvals by Tizita Belachew, head of the service, or by Solomon Abate, of stories on the war that included Tigrayan points of view; a majority of the stories only showed government or military officials' points of view; a fifth of the meetings had no reports on the war. Instructions emailed to staff stated that the terms \"civil war\" and \"war\" were forbidden in reporting on the Tigray War, with Scott Stearns writing on 14 November, according to Mail & Guardian, \"There are to be no deviations from these instructions by any member of any Africa division language service on any platform.\"[191] After Elon Musk acquired social media platform Twitter, in April 2023 National Public Radio's main Twitter account was briefly designated as \"US state-affiliated media\", a label typically reserved for foreign media outlets that directly represented the point of view of their respective governments, like Russia's RT and China's Xinhua.[193][194][195] A few days later, Twitter changed the designation of NPR's account from \"state-affiliated\" to \"government-funded\".[196] Twitter then added the label to other sources such as PBS, the BBC, and Voice of America, which all three objected to.[197] VOA criticized the decision, stating \"the label gives the impression that VOA is not an independent outlet,\" and that \"its editorial independence is protected by regulations and a firewall.\"[198] After the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, an email was sent to Voice of America staff from the associate editor for news standards with guidance related to how to refer to the actions (\"terrorist acts\" or \"acts of terror\") and advice about how to refer to individual members of Hamas, i.e. to use the term \"terrorist\" only in direct quotes from sources.[199] At the time, VOA was not the only news outlet with journalists discussing how to objectively refer to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict.[199] Six Republican members of Congress signed a letter sent by Senator Bill Hagerty, which criticized and strongly objected to the editorial guidance about how to refer to individual members of Hamas.[199] USAGM chief executive Amanda Bennett sent a letter to the senators to clarify that the VOA email was guidance only, and \"There is no policy prohibiting the use of the words 'terror,' 'terrorism,' or 'terrorist'\" at VOA, and stating the news organizations within USAGM \"counsel care and attention in the use of the words but do not place any restrictions on the appropriate use.\"[199] The controversy prompted Congress to reduce the budget of VOA's parent organization, USAGM.[200] A study was done on Chinese students in America. It found that through the VOA, they disapproved of the actions of the Chinese government.[201] Another study was done on Chinese scholars in America, and found that the VOA had an effect on their political beliefs. Their political beliefs did not change in relation to China, though, as they did not tend to believe the VOA's reports on China.[202] VOA's service in Iran had a negative impact on Kurds and Kurdistan according to the publication Kurdish Life in 2000. They claimed that the VOA exacerbated the conflict between the Talabani and the Barzani.[203] They further claimed that the VOA covered up wrongful imprisonments, wrongful arrests, and the building of extremist mosques. According to the same publication, Kurds were being turned into fanatics, and a new generation of terrorists was forming because of the VOA. They claimed the VOA was doing this to help PUK.[204] The VOA's DEEWA Radio airs in Pakistan. Although in 2015 some listeners were suspicious that the program was promoting an American agenda, others said they were experiencing a positive effect. Some listeners felt that the programs were giving a voice to the voiceless, giving them a sense of empowerment.[205] In 2018, the Pakistani authorities blocked the website of VOA's Pashto and Urdu language radio service.[206][207] In response to the request of the United States Department of Justice that RT register as a foreign agent under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, Russia's Justice Ministry Konovalov labeled Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty as foreign agents in December 2017.[208][209] On June 30, 2022, the Turkish media watchdog, Radio and Television Supreme Council (RT√úK), blocked access to VOA's website amerikaninsesi.com in Turkey because VOA had not applied for the necessary licence, which would subject VOA to certain obligations.[210][211] The RT√úK regulation requires foreign news outlets that publish in Turkey to apply for publication licenses, mandates that at least half of the media organization be owned by a Turkish citizen, and would force VOA to remove content deemed inappropriate by RT√úK.[212] VOA Turkish subsequently broadcast over a different VOA website domain name, voaturkce.com, which in August 2023 was blocked as well.[213] VOA said that \"Given VOA's status as a public service international broadcaster legally required to provide 'accurate, objective, and comprehensive' news coverage to its global audience, VOA cannot comply with any directive intended to enable censorship.\"[213] VOA Turkey, after it was blocked, shared instructions on its social media accounts as to how to use VPN to access its content.[214] Voice of America is seen by some listeners as having a positive impact and serving as US diplomacy, while others, like University of Peshawar's lecturer Faizullah Jan, see it as American propaganda.[205][201][215]",

                "content": "Sections About Connect With Us 1 / 0 By WYATTE GRANTHAM-PHILIPS AP Business Writer NEW YORK (AP) ‚Äî Are you a YouTube TV subscriber? Your monthly bills are about to get more expensive again. On Thursday, YouTube announced that it‚Äôs upping the price of its streaming service‚Äôs base plan by $10 ‚Äî citing ‚Äúthe rising cost of content‚Äù and other investments. The new $82.99 a month price tag will go into effect starting Jan. 13 for existing subscribers, and immediately for new customers who sign up going forward. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt make these decisions lightly, and we realize this impacts our members,‚Äù YouTube wrote on X. Google‚Äôs video giant also directed customers to an online FAQ for more information. Those who currently pay discounted prices, for example, won‚Äôt see the change until their trial or promotional has elapsed. YouTube TV has rolled out a series of price hikes over the years. When launched back in 2017, the going price of its streaming package was $35 a month. By 2019, that fee rose to $50 ‚Äî and has climbed higher and higher since. The last time YouTube TV raised its base price, then to $72.99, was in March 2023. Earlier increases arrived as YouTube TV added more and more channels for subscribers to stream live. But licensing disputes have also added pressures ‚Äî and YouTube has instead attributed its more recent hikes, like those announced both Thursday and last year, to rising operational costs. YouTube TV currently advertises more than 100 channels from broadcast, cable and regional sports networks, a DVR with unlimited storage and up to six accounts per household with three concurrent streams. And the platform says its latest price increase won‚Äôt change any of that. While YouTube TV‚Äôs live offerings are much different than individual online libraries seen from other popular streamers today, it‚Äôs no secret that streaming is getting more expensive overall ‚Äî particularly as consumers juggle multiple subscriptions to access all the content they want. In recent years, big names like Netflix, Apple TV+ and Disney+ have all either hikes their prices or added things like ad-supported tiers and password limits. And more and more streamers have also tapped into bundles to get in on the live action. YouTube TV‚Äôs new $82.99 price is the same as that advertised for Disney‚Äôs Hulu + Live TV bundle. As of February, YouTube said it had more than 8 million YouTube TV subscribers. All contents ¬© copyright 2024 Associated Press.

Well, here‚Äôs a lump of coal for your holiday stocking: Google just announced a stiff price hike for YouTube TV starting in the middle of next month. In an email sent to YouTube TV subscribers, Google said that it will boost the monthly price of its live TV streaming service to $82.99, a $10-a-month increase over the current $72.99 monthly rate. This news story is part of TechHive‚Äôs in-depth coverage of the best live TV streaming services. The price hike will go into effect on January 13, 2025, just a couple of weeks after the new year. Existing subscribers will see the price increase on their first bill following that date. If you‚Äôre currently subscribed to YouTube TV through a lower promotion rate, your discount will be honored until it expires, Google added. Word of the price hike comes just days after a Verizon promotion mentioning the higher YouTube TV subscription price was spotted on X. The ‚ÄúTeamYouTube‚Äù X account quickly commented on the posting, saying that the ad had listed ‚Äúthe incorrect price.‚Äù Well, maybe it was just a matter of semantics‚Äîafter all, the current YouTube TV price is still $72.99 a month. But whichever way you slice it, a YouTube TV hike is coming. The impending YouTube TV price hike will be the service‚Äôs first since April 2023, when YouTube TV‚Äôs monthly rate went up to its current price of $72.99 a month, a $7-a-month increase. In a support document, Google blames the price hike on ‚Äúthe rising cost of content,‚Äù adding that the new pricing is intended to ‚Äúreflect the complete value of YouTube TV. Of course, YouTube TV isn‚Äôt alone in raising its prices. Just last month, Slive TV boosted its live TV rates by $5.99 a month, citing‚Äîyou guessed it‚Äî‚Äùrising costs.‚Äù Back in October, Disney-owned Hulu raised the price for its ad-supported Hulu + Live TV service to $82.99 a month, a cost that now matches YouTube TV‚Äôs base rate.

The monthly fee for a base plan of YouTube TV is going up to $82.99 a month, from $72.99, starting today for new members and on Jan. 13 for existing subscribers. The Google subsidiary said it hiked prices to keep up with rising costs related to content and investments in service quality. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt take these pricing decisions lightly, and we give all members the flexibility to cancel their membership at any time,‚Äù a YouTube TV spokesperson told Quartz in an emailed statement. YouTube TV first debuted in 2017, offering subscribers livestreaming of local TV networks and some cable channels including ESPN (DIS+0.18%), CNN (WBD+14.19%) and TNT for just $35 a month. The last time it raised prices was in March 2023. The news comes as more people are watching YouTube and other services on their television sets. More Americans used their TVs to watch content on streaming platforms such as Netflix (NFLX-1.10%) and YouTube in November than they did on either broadcast or cable networks, according to a report from Nielsen. Streaming‚Äôs share of TV usage reached an all-time high of 41.6% in November. For comparison, the share of TV usage that same month was 23.7% for broadcast and 25% for cable. YouTube was the most-watch video streaming service, representing nearly 10.8% of all TV use in November. In a recent blog post, YouTube said people around the world streamed over 1 billion hours of content daily on their TVs this year. The company added that the amount of time people watched YouTube sports content on their TVs rose 30% in 2024.

He won one team and two individual gold medals at the 45th Chess Olympiad in 2024, as well as a bronze team medal. Gukesh is also a silver medalist at the Asian Games.[3] At the 2024 World Chess Championship, Gukesh defeated Ding Liren 7+1‚ÅÑ2 to 6+1‚ÅÑ2 to become the 18th World Chess Champion, winning 3 games out of 14. At the junior level, he is a multiple-gold medalist at the World Youth Championship and the Asian Youth Chess Championship. Gukesh was born on 29 May 2006 in Chennai into a Telugu family.[4][5] His father, Rajinikanth, is an ENT surgeon, and his mother, Padma, is a microbiologist.[6] He learned to play chess at the age of seven.[7] He studied at the Velammal Vidyalaya school, Mel Ayanambakkam, Chennai.[8] Gukesh began practicing and playing chess in 2013 for one hour, three days a week. After his good performance was acknowledged by his chess teachers, he began to participate more often and play tournaments on weekends.[9] Gukesh won the Under-9 section of the Asian School Chess Championships in 2015[10] and the World Youth Chess Championships in 2018 in the Under 12 category.[11] He also won five gold medals at the 2018 Asian Youth Chess Championships in the U-12 individual rapid and blitz, U-12 team rapid and blitz and U-12 individual classical formats.[12] He completed the requirements for the title of International Master in March 2017 at the 34th Cappelle-la-Grande Open.[13] On 15 January 2019, at the age of 12 years, 7 months, and 17 days, Gukesh became the then second-youngest grandmaster in history,[14] only surpassed by Sergey Karjakin by 17 days.[15] The record has since been beaten by Abhimanyu Mishra, making Gukesh the third-youngest.[16][17] In June 2021, he won the Julius Baer Challengers Chess Tour, Gelfand Challenge, scoring 14 out of 19 points.[18] In August 2022, he played the 44th Chess Olympiad and initially had a perfect score of 8/8, notably defeating US No. 1 Fabiano Caruana in the eighth match. He finished with a score of 9 out of 11, earning the gold medal on the 1st board and his team India-2 finished third in the tournament. In September 2022, Gukesh reached a rating of over 2700 for the first time, with a rating of 2726.[19] This made him the third-youngest player to pass 2700, after Wei Yi and Alireza Firouzja.[20] In October 2022 during the Aimchess Rapid tournament, Gukesh became the youngest player to beat Magnus Carlsen since the latter became World Champion.[21] In the August 2023 rating list, Gukesh became the youngest player ever to reach a rating of 2750.[22] Gukesh participated in the Chess World Cup 2023. He defeated Misratdin Iskandarov, S. L. Narayanan, Andrey Esipenko, and Wang Hao to qualify for the quarterfinals, where he was defeated by world No. 1 Magnus Carlsen.[23] In the September 2023 rating list, Gukesh officially surpassed Viswanathan Anand as the top-ranked Indian player, marking the first time in 37 years that Anand was not the top-ranked Indian player.[24][25] In December 2023, with the end of the FIDE Circuit, Gukesh qualified for the 2024 Candidates Tournament.[26] Gukesh had placed second in the Circuit, but Fabiano Caruana, the winner, had already qualified through the World Cup.[27] He became the third youngest player to qualify for a Candidates tournament, behind Bobby Fischer and Magnus Carlsen.[28][29] In January 2024, Gukesh participated in the Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2024. He scored 8.5/13 to finish in a 4-way tie for first place. In the twelfth round, he had a winning position against R Praggnanandhaa, but blundered into a threefold repetition. In tiebreaks, he defeated Anish Giri in semifinals but lost to Wei Yi in the finals.[30] In April 2024, Gukesh participated in the 2024 Candidates Tournament. Gukesh won games against R Praggnanandhaa and Vidit Gujrathi playing as black, Alireza Firouzja playing as white, and Nijat Abasov playing as both black and white.[31] His only loss was his game with black against Firouzja. This gave him five wins, one loss and eight draws, for a score of 9/14, winning the tournament and qualifying for the 2024 World Championship match against Ding Liren.[32] He is the youngest ever winner of the Candidates.[33][34][35] In September 2024, Gukesh took part in the Chess Olympiad in Budapest as part of the Indian team. He showcased a dominant performance on board one, defeating Wei Yi, Parham Maghsoodloo, and Fabiano Caruana and finishing with 9 points in 10 rounds. He had the highest performance rating of 3056 among all players in the tournament. His performance earned him an individual gold medal on board one, and helped India to their first ever team gold medal at the Olympiad.[36] Gukesh entered the FIDE world top-five for the first time on 1 October 2024.[37][38] Gukesh became the 18th World Chess Champion on 12 December 2024 after defeating Ding Liren in the last game and winning the World Chess Championship by 7.5‚Äì6.5.[39] The win made him the youngest undisputed World Chess Champion, with only Ruslan Ponomariov, the winner of the 2002 World Chess Championship, a knock-out style tournament during the period where there was a title split in the chess world, being younger.[40]",

The basilica is the most-visited Catholic shrine in the world, and the world's third most-visited sacred site.[2][3] According to the Nican Mopohua, included in the 17th-century Huei tlamahui√ßoltica, written in Nahuatl, the Virgin Mary appeared four times to Juan Diego, a Chichimec peasant, and once to his uncle, Juan Bernardino. The first apparition occurred on the morning of Saturday, December 9, 1531 (Julian calendar, which is December 19 on the (proleptic) Gregorian calendar in present use). Juan Diego experienced a vision of a young woman at a place called the Hill of Tepeyac, which later became part of Villa de Guadalupe, in a suburb of Mexico City.[4] According to the accounts, the woman, speaking to Juan Diego in Nahuatl, his first language and the language of the former Aztec Empire, identified herself as the Mary, \"mother of the very true deity\".[5] She was said to have asked for a church to be erected at that site in her honor.[4] Based on her words, Juan Diego then sought the Archbishop of Mexico City, Juan de Zum√°rraga, to tell him what had happened. Not unexpectedly, the Archbishop did not believe Diego. Later the same day, Juan Diego saw the young woman again (the second apparition), and she asked him to continue insisting.[4] The next day, Sunday, December 10, 1531, in the Julian calendar, Juan Diego spoke to the Archbishop a second time. The latter instructed him to return to Tepeyac and to ask the woman for a truly acceptable, miraculous sign to prove her identity. Later that day, the third apparition appeared when Juan Diego returned to Tepeyac; encountering the same woman, he reported to her the Archbishop's request for a sign, which she consented to provide on the next day (December 11).[6] On Monday, December 11, however, Juan Diego‚Äôs uncle fell ill and he was obliged to attend to him. In the early hours of Tuesday, December 12, as Juan Bernardino's condition deteriorated, Juan Diego journeyed to Tlatelolco in search of a Catholic priest to hear Juan Bernardino's confession and help minister to him on his deathbed.[4] To avoid being delayed by the Virgin and ashamed at having failed to meet her on Monday as agreed, Juan Diego chose another route around Tepeyac Hill, yet the Virgin intercepted him and asked where he was going (fourth apparition); Juan Diego explained what had happened and the Virgin gently chided him for not having made recourse to her. In the words which have become the most famous phrase of the Guadalupe apparitions and are inscribed above the main entrance to the Basilica of Guadalupe, she asked \"¬øNo estoy yo aqu√≠ que soy tu madre?\" (\"Am I not here, I who am your mother?\"). She assured him that Juan Bernardino had now recovered and told him to gather flowers from the summit of Tepeyac Hill, which was normally barren, especially in the cold of December. Juan Diego obeyed her instruction and he found Castilian roses, not native to Mexico, blooming there.[4] According to the story, the Virgin arranged the flowers in Juan Diego's tilm√†tli or cloak, and when Juan Diego opened his cloak later that day before Archbishop Zum√°rraga, the flowers fell to the floor, revealing on the fabric the image of the Virgin.[4] The next day, December 13, Juan Diego found his uncle fully recovered as the Virgin had assured him, and Juan Bernardino recounted that he also had seen her after praying at his bedside (fifth apparition); that she had instructed him to inform the Archbishop of this apparition and of his miraculous cure; and that she had told him she desired to be known under the title of \"Guadalupe\".[4] The Archbishop kept Juan Diego's mantle, first in his private chapel and then in the church on public display, where it attracted great attention. On December 26, 1531, a procession formed to transfer the miraculous image back to Tepeyac Hill where it was installed in a small, hastily erected chapel.[7] During this procession, the first miracle was allegedly performed when a native was mortally wounded in the neck by an arrow shot by accident during some stylized martial displays performed in honor of the Virgin. In great distress, the natives carried him before the Virgin's image and pleaded for his life. Upon the arrow being withdrawn, the victim fully and immediately recovered.[8] The shrine to Our Lady of Guadalupe in Guadalupe, C√°ceres, in Extremadura, Spain, was the most important of the shrines to the Virgin Mary in the medieval Kingdom of Castile.[9] It is one of the many Black Madonnas in Spain and is revered in the Monastery of Santa Mar√≠a de Guadalupe, in the town of Guadalupe, from which numerous Spanish conquistadors stem. The most popular etymology of the name \"Guadalupe\" is from the Arabic \"Wadi\" (river) and the Latin word \"lupus\" (wolf). Some find it unlikely that Arabic and Latin would be combined in this way, and suggest as an alternative the Arabic \"Wadi-al-lub\", signifying a river with black stones in its bed.[10] The shrine houses a statue reputed to have been carved by Luke the Evangelist and given to Archbishop Leander of Seville by Pope Gregory I. According to local legend, when Seville was taken by the Moors in 712, a group of priests fled northward and buried the statue in the hills near the Guadalupe River.[11] At the beginning of the 14th century, the Virgin appeared one day to a humble cowboy named Gil Cordero who was searching for a missing animal in the mountains.[12] Cordero claimed that Mary had appeared to him and ordered him to ask priests to dig at the site of the apparition. Excavating priests rediscovered the hidden statue and built a small shrine around it which became the great Guadalupe monastery.[11] Following the Conquest in 1519‚Äì1521, the Marian cult was brought to the Americas and Franciscan friars often leveraged syncretism with existing religious beliefs as an instrument for evangelization. What is purported by some to be the earliest mention of the miraculous apparition of the Virgin is a page of parchment, the Codex Escalada from 1548, which was discovered in 1995 and, according to investigative analysis, dates from the sixteenth century.[13] This document bears two pictorial representations of Juan Diego and the apparition, several inscriptions in Nahuatl referring to Juan Diego by his Aztec name, and the date of his death: 1548, as well as the year that the then named Virgin Mary appeared: 1531. It also contains the glyph of Antonio Valeriano; and finally, the signature of Fray Bernardino de Sahagun which was authenticated by experts from the Banco de Mexico and Charles E. Dibble.[14] Historians Alberto Peralta and Stafford Poole questioned the authenticity of the document.[15][16] A more complete early description of the apparition occurs in a 16-page manuscript called the Nican mopohua, which has been reliably dated in 1556 and was acquired by the New York Public Library in 1880. This document, written in Nahuatl, tells the story of the apparitions and the supernatural origin of the image. It was probably composed by a native Aztec man, Antonio Valeriano, who had been educated by Franciscans. The text of this document was later incorporated into a printed pamphlet which was widely circulated in 1649.[17][18][19][20] In spite of these documents, there are no known 16th century written accounts of the Guadalupe vision by the archbishop Juan de Zum√°rraga.[21] In particular, the canonical account of the vision features archbishop Juan de Zum√°rraga as a major player in the story, but, although Zum√°rraga was a prolific writer, there is nothing in his extant writings that can confirm the indigenous story.[22] The written record suggests the Catholic clergy in 16th century Mexico were deeply divided as to the orthodoxy of the native beliefs springing up around the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe, with the Franciscan order (who then had custody of the chapel at Tepeyac) being strongly opposed to the outside groups, while the Dominicans supported it.[23] The main promoter of the story was the Dominican Alonso de Mont√∫far, who succeeded the Franciscan Juan de Zum√°rraga as archbishop of Mexico. In a 1556 sermon Mont√∫far commended popular devotion to \"Our Lady of Guadalupe\", referring to a painting on cloth (the tilma) in the chapel of the Virgin Mary at Tepeyac, where certain miracles had also occurred. Days later, Fray Francisco de Bustamante, local head of the Franciscan order, delivered a sermon denouncing the native belief and believers. He expressed concern that the Catholic Archbishop was promoting a superstitious regard for an indigenous image:[24] The devotion at the chapel... to which they have given the name Guadalupe was prejudicial to the Indians because they believed that the image itself worked miracles, contrary to what the missionary friars had been teaching them, and because many were disappointed when it did not. Archbishop Mont√∫far opened an inquiry into the matter at which the Franciscans repeated their position that the image encouraged idolatry and superstition, and four witnesses testified to Bustamante's statement that the image was painted by an Indian, with one witness naming him \"the Indian painter Marcos\".[25] This could refer to the Aztec painter Marcos Cipac de Aquino, who was active at that time.[26][27] Prof. Jody Brant Smith, referring to Philip Serna Callahan's examination of the tilma using infrared photography in 1979, wrote: \"if Marcos did, he apparently did so without making a preliminary sketches ‚Äì in itself then seen as a near-miraculous procedure... Cipac may well have had a hand in painting the Image, but only in painting the additions, such as the angel and moon at the Virgin's feet.\"[28] Ultimately Archbishop Mont√∫far, himself a Dominican, decided to end Franciscan custody of the shrine.[29] From then on the shrine was kept and served by diocesan priests under the authority of the archbishop.[30] Moreover, Archbishop Mont√∫far authorized the construction of a much larger church at Tepeyac, in which the tilma was later mounted and displayed.[31] In the late 1570s, the Franciscan historian Bernardino de Sahag√∫n denounced the cult at Tepeyac and the use of the name \"Tonantzin\" or to call her Our Lady in a personal digression in his General History of the Things of New Spain, also known as the \"Florentine Codex\": At this place [Tepeyac], [the Indians] had a temple dedicated to the mother of the gods, whom they called Tonantzin, which means Our Mother. There they performed many sacrifices in honor of this goddess ... And now that a church of Our Lady of Guadalupe is built there, they also called her Tonantzin, being motivated by those preachers who called Our Lady, the Mother of God, Tonantzin. While it is not known for certain where the beginning of Tonantzin may have originated, but this we know for certain, that, from its first usage, the word refers to the ancient Tonantzin. And it was viewed as something that should be remedied, for their having [native] name of the Mother of God, Holy Mary, instead of Tonantzin, but Dios inantzin. It appears to be a Satanic invention to cloak idolatry under the confusion of this name, Tonantzin. And they now come to visit from very far away, as far away as before, which is also suspicious, because everywhere there are many churches of Our Lady and they do not go to them. They come from distant lands to this Tonantzin as in olden times.[32] Sahag√∫n's criticism of the indigenous group seems to have stemmed primarily from his concern about a syncretistic application of the native name Tonantzin to the Catholic Virgin Mary. However, Sahag√∫n often used the same name in his sermons as late as the 1560s.[33] One of the first printed accounts of the history of the apparitions and image occurs in Imagen de la Virgen Maria, Madre de Dios de Guadalupe, published in 1648 by Miguel S√°nchez, a diocesan priest of Mexico City.[34] Another account is the Codex Escalada, dating from the sixteenth century, a sheet of parchment recording apparitions of the Virgin Mary and the figure of Juan Diego, which reproduces the glyph of Antonio Valeriano alongside the signature of Fray Bernardino de Sahag√∫n. It contains the following glosses: \"1548 Also in that year of 1531 appeared to Cuahtlatoatzin our beloved mother the Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico. Cuahtlatoatzin died worthily\"[35] The next printed account was a 36-page tract in the Nahuatl language, Huei tlamahui√ßoltica (\"The Great Event\"), which was published in 1649. This tract contains a section called the Nican mopohua (\"Here it is recounted\"), which has been already touched on above. The composition and authorship of the Huei tlamahui√ßoltica is assigned by a majority of those scholars to Luis Laso de la Vega, vicar of the sanctuary of Tepeyac from 1647 to 1657.[36] Nevertheless, the most important section of the tract, the Nican Mopohua, appears to be much older. It has been attributed since the late 1600s to Antonio Valeriano (c. 1531‚Äì1605), a native Aztec man who had been educated by the Franciscans and who collaborated extensively with Bernardino de Sahag√∫n.[17] A manuscript version of the Nican Mopohua, which is now held by the New York Public Library,[37] appears to be dated to c. 1556, and may have been the original work by Valeriano, as that was used by Laso in composing the Huei tlamahui√ßoltica. Most authorities agree on the dating and on Valeriano's authorship.[18][19][20] On the other hand, in 1666, the scholar Luis Becerra Tanco published in Mexico a book about the history of the apparitions under the name Origen milagroso del santuario de Nuestra Se√±ora de Guadalupe, which was republished in Spain in 1675 as Felicidad de Mexico.[38] In the same way, in 1688, Jesuit Father Francisco de Florencia published La Estrella del Norte de M√©xico, giving the history of the same apparitions.[39] Two separate accounts, one in Nahuatl from Juan Bautista del Barrio de San Juan from the 16th century,[40] and the other in Spanish by Servando Teresa de Mier[41] date the original apparition and native celebration on September 8 of the Julian calendar, but the latter also says that the Spaniards celebrate it on December 12 instead.[42] According to the document Informaciones Jur√≠dicas de 1666, a Catholic feast day in name of Our Lady of Guadalupe was requested and approved, as well as the transfer of the date of the feast of the Virgin of Guadalupe from September 8 to December 12, the latest date on which the Virgin supposedly appeared to Juan Diego. The initiative to perform them was made by Francisco de Siles who proposed to ask the Church of Rome, a Mass itself with allusive text to the apparitions and stamping of the image, along with the divine office itself, and the precept of hearing a Catholic Mass on December 12, the last date of the apparitions of the Virgin to Juan Diego as the new date to commemorate the apparitions (which until then was on September 8, the birth of the Virgin).[43] In 1666, the Church in M√©xico began gathering information from people who reported having known Juan Diego, and in 1723 a formal investigation into his life was ordered, where more data was gathered to support his veneration. Because of the Informaciones Jur√≠dicas de 1666 in the year 1754, the Sacred Congregation of Rites confirmed the true and valid value of the apparitions, and granted celebrating Mass and Office for the then Catholic version of the feast of Guadalupe on December 12.[44][45] These published accounts of the origin of the image already venerated in Tepeyac, then increased interest in the identity of Juan Diego, who was the original recipient of the prime vision. A new Catholic Basilica church was built to house the image. Completed in 1709, it is now known as the Old Basilica.[46] The image[which?] had originally featured a 12-point crown on the Virgin's head, but this disappeared in 1887‚Äì88. The change was first noticed on February 23, 1888, when the image was removed to a nearby church.[48] Eventually a painter confessed on his deathbed that he had been instructed by a clergyman to remove the crown. This may have been motivated by the fact that the gold paint was flaking off of the crown, leaving it looking dilapidated. But according to the historian David Brading, \"the decision to remove rather than replace the crown was no doubt inspired by a desire to 'modernize' the image and reinforce its similarity to the nineteenth-century images of the Immaculate Conception which were exhibited at Lourdes and elsewhere... What is rarely mentioned is that the frame which surrounded the canvas was adjusted to leave almost no space above the Virgin's head, thereby obscuring the effects of the erasure.\"[49] A different crown was installed to the image. On February 8, 1887, a Papal bull from Pope Leo XIII granted permission a Canonical Coronation of the image, which occurred on October 12, 1895.[50] Since then the Virgin of Guadalupe has been proclaimed \"Queen of Mexico\", \"Patroness of the Americas\", \"Empress of Latin America\", and \"Protectress of Unborn Children\" (the latter two titles given by Pope John Paul II in 1999).[51][52] On November 14, 1921, a bomb hidden within a basket of flowers and left under the tilma by an anti-Catholic secularist exploded and damaged the altar of the Basilica that houses the original image, but the tilma was unharmed. A brass standing crucifix, bent by the explosion, is now preserved at the shrine's museum and is believed to be miraculous by devotees.[53][54] Under Pope John Paul II the move to beatify Juan Diego intensified. John Paul II took a special interest in non-European Catholics and saints. During his leadership, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints declared Juan Diego \"venerable\" (in 1987), and the pope himself announced his beatification on May 6, 1990, during a Mass at the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City, declaring him \"protector and advocate of the indigenous peoples\", with December 9 established as his feast day.[55] At that time historians revived doubts as to the quality of the evidence regarding Juan Diego. The writings of bishop Zum√°rraga, into whose hands Juan purportedly delivered the miraculous image, did not refer to him or the event. The record of the 1556 ecclesiastical inquiry omitted him, and he was not mentioned in documentation before the mid-17th century. In 1996 the 83-year-old abbot of the Basilica of Guadalupe, Guillermo Schulenburg, was forced to resign following an interview published in the Catholic magazine Ixthus, in which he was quoted as saying that Juan Diego was \"a symbol, not a reality\", and that his canonization would be the \"recognition of a cult. It is not recognition of the physical, real existence of a person.\"[56] In 1883 Joaqu√≠n Garc√≠a Icazbalceta, historian and biographer of Zum√°rraga, in a confidential report on the Lady of Guadalupe for Bishop Labastida, had been hesitant to support the story of the vision. He concluded that Juan Diego had not existed.[57] In 1995, Father Xavier Escalada, a Jesuit whose four volume Guadalupe encyclopedia had just been published, announced the existence of a sheet of parchment (known as Codex Escalada), which bore an illustrated account of the vision and some notations in Nahuatl concerning the life and death of Juan Diego. Previously unknown, the document was dated 1548. It bore the signatures of Antonio Valeriano and Bernardino de Sahag√∫n, which are considered to verify its contents. The codex was the subject of an appendix to the Guadalupe encyclopedia, published in 1997.[15][pages needed][58] Some scholars remained unconvinced, one describing the discovery of the Codex as \"rather like finding a picture of St. Paul's vision of Christ on the road to Damascus, drawn by St. Luke and signed by St. Peter.\"[59] Skeptics, both from within the Catholic Church[60] as well as outside it, have doubted the historical veracity of the account of the Lady of Guadalupe, and it has been said[61] that \"[a]lmost every aspect of the story of Juan Diego has been called into question\". In particular, there is no contemporary documentary evidence for the apparition.[62] The main source, the Huei tlamahui√ßoltica, was published in 1649; its time of writing is not known with certainty, but a formal inquiry into the image of Guadalupe was made in 1556 and does not mention the legend or its central character Juan Diego.[63] This has been cited in support of the claim that the Huei tlamahui√ßoltica and the legend it narrates date to after that time.[64] The report of the 1556 investigation stated that the image had been painted by a native artist the previous year,[65][66] which would directly contradict the hypothesis of a supernatural origin in 1531. In the earliest account of the apparition, the Nican Mopohua, the Virgin de Guadalupe, later called as if the Virgin Mary tells Juan Bernardino, the uncle of Juan Diego, that the image left on the tilma is to be known by the name \"the Perfect Virgin, Holy Mary of Guadalupe\".[67] There have been various efforts to find a pre-Hispanic origin in the cult, including attempts to find a Nahuatl etymology to the name. The first theory to promote this Nahuatl origin was that of Luis Becerra Tanco.[68] In his 1675 work Felicidad de Mexico, Becerra Tanco said that Juan Bernardino and Juan Diego would not have been able to understand the name Guadalupe because the \"d\" and \"g\" sounds do not exist in Nahuatl.[68] He proposed two Nahuatl alternative names that sound similar to \"Guadalupe\", Tecuatlanopeuh [tek ∑atÕ°…¨aÀànope ç], which he translates as \"she whose origins were in the rocky summit\", and Tecuantlaxopeuh [tek ∑antÕ°…¨aÀà Éope ç], \"she who banishes those who devoured us.\"[68] Ondina and Justo Gonz√°lez suggest that the name is a Spanish version of the Nahuatl term, CoƒÅtlaxopeuh [koaÀêtÕ°…¨aÀà Éope ç], which they interpret as meaning \"the one who crushes the serpent\", and that it may seem to be referring to the feathered serpent Quetzalcoatl. In addition, the Virgin Mary was portrayed in European art as crushing the serpent of the Garden of Eden.[69] Sahag√∫n claimed that the Aztecs had previously worshiped the goddess Tonantzin (sometimes identified with Coatl√≠cue or Cihuacoatl) at Tepeyac. He believed that the shrine to Our Lady of Guadalupe allowed them to continue their worship of Tonantzin, since they neglected other Marian shrines to come to Tepeyac.[70] The theory promoting the Spanish origin of the name says that: The image of Our Lady of Guadalupe is of a life-sized, dark-haired, olive-skinned young woman, standing with her head slightly inclined to her right, eyes downcast, and her hands held before her in prayer. She wears a pink dress ornamented with a floral design, a dark ribbon tied above her waist, and a blue-green mantle over all. The mantle is edged with gold and has golden stars throughout. She stands on a crescent moon, which is supported by an angel with eagle wings. She is surrounded by a golden sunburst.[71][72][73] The tilma now measures approximately 1.72 meters by 1.07 meters,[74] though sources vary by a few centimeters, and it shows signs of having been trimmed from the original size. It is made of two pieces of fabric sewn together with cotton thread.[75] There is a large crack running vertically through the middle of the image, as well as smaller horizontal cracks, caused by the image being folded at some point.[76] The image is currently housed in a golden frame above the main altar of the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City, where it has been since the new basilica was completed in 1976.[77] The iconography of the Virgin is fully Catholic:[78] Miguel S√°nchez, the author of the 1648 tract Imagen de la Virgen Mar√≠a, described her as the Woman of the Apocalypse from the New Testament's Revelation 12:1, \"clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.\" She is described as a representation of the Immaculate Conception.[59] Virgil Elizondo says the image also had layers of meaning for the indigenous people of Mexico who associated her image with their polytheistic deities, which further contributed to her popularity.[79][80] Her blue-green mantle was the color reserved for the divine couple Ometecuhtli and Omecihuatl;[81] her belt is interpreted as a sign of pregnancy; and a cross-shaped image, symbolizing the cosmos and called nahui-ollin, is inscribed beneath the image's sash.[82] She was called \"mother of maguey\",[83] the source of the sacred beverage pulque.[84] Pulque was also known as \"the milk of the Virgin\".[85] The rays of light surrounding her are seen to also represent maguey spines.[83] The image and tilma have been examined numerous times over the years. In 1662, canons of the cathedral in Mexico City began the process of asking for a proper liturgy for Our Lady of Guadalupe on December 12. As part of this request, Rome asked for a canonical investigation into the apparitions. The canons carried out this investigation from 1665‚Äì1666,[86] including an examination of the image in March 1666.[87] On March 13, 1666, seven painters examined the image, accompanied by the viceroy and several clerics. The painters unanimously agreed that it was \"impossible that any artist could paint and work something so beautiful, clean, and well-formed on a fabric which is as rough as is the tilma\",[88][87] and that the image must therefore be miraculous. They also noted the degree of preservation of the image and tilma, and that the tilma had not been prepared for painting.[89] On March 28, three members of the protom√©dico of New Spain also examined the image. They also noted how well-preserved the image was given the local climate, and saw this as evidence of the image's supernatural origin.[90] In contrast, the silver of the moon and the gold on the sunburst, which had both been added to the original, were faded.[87] On April 30, 1751, a group of eight painters headed by Jos√© de Ibarra were allowed to examine the image. On April 15, 1752, one of the painters, Miguel Cabrera, was again allowed access to the image in order to create three copies.[91][92] In 1756, Cabrera published his account of the image, approved by the other painters, entitled Maravilla Americana.[92] Like the previous report, Cabrera noted the preservation of the image despite the climate. He said that the tilma was two pieces of cloth sewn together, and that it felt soft, probably made of ayate fibers rather than the coarser maguey, as others had claimed. He discovered signs of four different painting techniques which he claimed had never been used in combination before. He said that the image had not been sized, and thus the image could be seen through the back of the cloth, though all but a small portion of the back was covered with silver at the time.[93][94] In 1787, another group of painters examined the image at the request of Jos√© Ignacio Bartolache [es], a doctor and mathematician. They confirmed Cabrera's opinion that the fabric of the tilma was not coarse, but determined that it was of palm fibers. Contrary to Cabrera, however, they claimed that the image had been sized beforehand, and was not visible from behind; however, four years later, two of the painters claimed that they had never seen the back of the image and did not know if it had been sized.[95] The artists came to the conclusion that the parts of the image that were original were of divine origin, though they noted that there were some touch-ups that were clearly the work of human hands, the first study to so note.[95][92] Art restorer Jos√© Antonio Flores G√≥mez was hired by the abbot of the basilica to work on the image in 1947 and 1973. In a 2002 interview with the magazine Proceso, he spoke about his experience. He noted that he had not been required to keep silent about his work, but had done so of his own accord.[76] When he examined the image in 1947, he saw a large crack in the paint running vertically through the middle of the image, as well as some smaller horizontal cracks, which he thought were caused by the image having been folded. He also saw signs that others had touched up the image at various points. The necessity of touching up the image convinced him that it was of human origin.[76] Like others, Flores G√≥mez noted the softness of the tilma, which seemed to him more like cotton than the rougher agave traditionally claimed. He also said that the paints used in the image came from natural pigments, such as from the cochineal.[76] In 1981, Philip Serna Callahan and Jody Brant Smith examined the image under infrared light, a common technique in art analysis. They were unable to find any trace of sizing or sketching underneath the paint. They concluded that, while there had been additions to and touch-ups of the image, which were in a poor state, there was no explanation for the original parts of the image or their preservation.[96] In 1982, Guillermo Schulenburg, abbot of the basilica, hired Jos√© Sol Rosales of the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes y Literatura to study the image. Sol Rosales thought that the tilma was made of linen and hemp, and not either agave or cotton. Contrary to previous claims, he said that the fabric had been prepared with white paint before the image had been painted. He saw several different styles of tempera throughout the image. He held that the paints were made from various natural pigments, and further noted that all of these pigments were commonly available in 16th-century Mexico. Like Flores G√≥mez, Sol Rosales saw various touch-ups and repainting throughout the image.[97] Sol Rosales concluded that the image was of human origin. He claimed that others, like Cabrera, had had similar findings, but concluded that the image was divine due to social pressures.[97] Sol Rosales and his team were supervised during the investigation by Schulenburg and others. Schulenburg sent the results of this study to the Vatican, cautioning against the canonization of Juan Diego.[76] Several studies have examined the eyes of the image. The authors of these studies claim that they have found images in the eyes corresponding to the people believed to have been present when Juan Diego opened his tilma before the bishop. The eyes are also claimed to contain Purkinje images exactly where they would be expected to be found in living eyes.[98] Critics of these studies liken the figures to inkblots in which proponents see what they hope to see.[99] Juan Diego's tilma has become Mexico's most popular religious and cultural symbol, and has received widespread ecclesiastical and popular veneration. In the 19th century it became the rallying cry of the Spaniards born in America, in what they denominated 'New Spain'. They said they considered the apparitions as legitimizing their own indigenous Mexican origin. They infused it with an almost messianic sense of mission and identity, thereby also justifying their armed rebellion against Spain.[100][101] Nuestra Se√±ora de Guadalupe became a recognized symbol of Catholic Mexicans. Miguel S√°nchez, the author in 1648 of the first published account of the vision, identified Guadalupe as Revelation's Woman of the Apocalypse, and said: ... this New World has been won and conquered by the hand of the Virgin Mary ... who had prepared, disposed, and contrived her exquisite likeness in this, her Mexican land, which was conquered for such a glorious purpose, won that there should appear so Mexican an image.[59] Throughout the Mexican national history of the 19th and 20th centuries, the Guadalupan name and image have been unifying national symbols; the first President of Mexico (1824‚Äì1829) changed his name from Jos√© Miguel Ram√≥n Adaucto Fern√°ndez y F√©lix to Guadalupe Victoria in honor of the Virgin of Guadalupe.[102] Father Miguel Hidalgo, in the Mexican War of Independence (1810), and Emiliano Zapata, in the Mexican Revolution (1910), led their respective armed forces with Guadalupan flags emblazoned with an image of Our Lady of Guadalupe.[103] In 1999, the Church officially proclaimed her the Patroness of the Americas, the Empress of Latin America, and the Protectress of Unborn Children.[104] In 1810, Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla initiated the bid for Mexican independence with his Grito de Dolores, with the cry \"Death to the Spaniards and long live the Virgin of Guadalupe!\" When Hidalgo's mestizo-indigenous army attacked Guanajuato and Valladolid, they placed \"the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, which was the insignia of their enterprise, on sticks or on reeds painted different colors\" and \"they all wore a print of the Virgin on their hats.\"[102] After Hidalgo's death, leadership of the revolution fell to a mestizo priest named Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos, who led insurgent troops in the Mexican south. Morelos adopted the Virgin as the seal of his Congress of Chilpancingo, inscribing her feast day into the Chilpancingo constitution and declaring that Guadalupe was the power behind his victories: New Spain puts less faith in its own efforts than in the power of God and the intercession of its Blessed Mother, who appeared within the precincts of Tepeyac as the miraculous image of Guadalupe that had come to comfort us, defend us, visibly be our protection.[102] Sim√≥n Bol√≠var noticed the Guadalupan theme in these uprisings, and shortly before Morelos's execution in 1815 wrote: \"the leaders of the independence struggle have put fanaticism to use by proclaiming the famous Virgin of Guadalupe as the queen of the patriots, praying to her in times of hardship and displaying her on their flags... the veneration for this image in Mexico far exceeds the greatest reverence that the shrewdest prophet might inspire.\"[59] In 1912, Emiliano Zapata's peasant army rose out of the south against the government of Francisco Madero. Though Zapata's rebel forces were primarily interested in land reform‚Äî\"tierra y libertad\" ('land and liberty') was the slogan of the uprising‚Äîwhen his peasant troops penetrated Mexico City, they carried Guadalupan banners.[105] More recently, the contemporary Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) named their \"mobile city\" in honor of the Virgin: it is called Guadalupe Tepeyac. EZLN spokesperson Subcomandante Marcos wrote a humorous letter in 1995 describing the EZLN bickering over what to do with a Guadalupe statue they had received as a gift.[106] Harringon argues that: The Aztecs... had an elaborate, coherent symbolic system for making sense of their lives. When this was destroyed by the Spaniards, something new was needed to fill the void and make sense of New Spain ... the image of Guadalupe served that purpose.[107] According to the traditional account, the name of Guadalupe, as the name was heard or understood by Spaniards, was chosen by the Virgin herself when she appeared on the hill outside Mexico City in 1531, ten years after the Conquest.[108] Guadalupe continues to be a mixture of the cultures which blended to form Mexico, both racially and religiously,[109] \"the first mestiza\",[110] or \"the first Mexican\",[111] \"bringing together people of distinct cultural heritages, while at the same time affirming their distinctness.\"[112] As Jacques Lafaye wrote in Quetzalcoatl and Guadalupe, \"as the Christians built their first churches with the rubble and the columns of the ancient pagan temples, so they often borrowed pagan customs for their own cult purposes.\"[113] The author Judy King asserts that Guadalupe is a \"common denominator\" uniting Mexicans. Writing that Mexico is composed of a vast patchwork of differences‚Äîlinguistic, ethnic, and class-based‚ÄîKing says \"The Virgin of Guadalupe is the rubber band that binds this disparate nation into a whole.\"[111] The Mexican novelist, Carlos Fuentes, once said that \"you cannot truly be considered a Mexican unless you believe in the Virgin of Guadalupe.\"[114] Nobel Literature laureate Octavio Paz wrote in 1974 that \"The Mexican people, after more than two centuries of experiments and defeats, have faith only in the Virgin of Guadalupe and the National Lottery.\"[115] The shrine of the Virgin of Guadalupe is the most visited Catholic pilgrimage destination in the world. Over the Friday and Saturday of December 11 to 12, 2009, a record number of 6.1 million pilgrims visited the Basilica of Guadalupe in Mexico City to commemorate the anniversary of the apparition.[116] Religious imagery of Our Lady of Guadalupe appears in Roman Catholic parishes, especially those with Latin American heritage.[117] In addition, due to the growth of Hispanic communities in the United States, religious imagery of Our Lady of Guadalupe has started appearing in some Anglican, Lutheran, and Methodist churches.[117] The Virgin of Guadalupe is considered the Patroness of Mexico and the Continental Americas; she is also venerated by Native Americans, on the account of the devotion calling for the conversion of the Americas.[118] Due to Mary's appearance as a pregnant mother and her claims as mother of all in the apparition, the Blessed Virgin Mary, under this title is popularly invoked as Patroness of the Unborn and a common image for the Pro-Life movement.[119][120][121] Due to her association as a crusader of social justice, the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe has been utilized as a symbol across regions to advance political movements and mobilize the masses. For instance, the image has most notably been utilized in Mexico's Independence movement in the early 19th century, the United Farm Worker Movement in the U.S. in the 20th century and in contemporary political causes like immigration.[135][136] In Mexico's Independence, the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe became associated with the movement after Father Miguel Hidalgo rallied and united insurgents under her banner. In fact, the first president of the Mexican republic, Jos√© Miguel Ram√≥n Adaucto Fern√°ndez y F√©lix, who was heavily involved in Mexico's Independence war, changed his name as to Guadalupe Victoria as a sign of devotion.[137][136] In the United Farm Workers Union (UFW), its leader, Cesar Chavez, was a devout Catholic who drew on his religious beliefs to demand for better wages and labor practices for farm workers in the U.S.[138] He incorporated his religious beliefs in the movement by holding masses in the picket lines and prayers before meetings, and leading a pilgrimage from Delano to Sacramento in 1966 during Lent.[138] Similarly to Mexico's Independence movement, the famous pilgrimage in 1966 that drew national attention to the cause was lead under a banner with the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe.[139] The image of Our Lady of Guadalupe is also present in the contemporary political discussion on immigration. Artists like Ester Hernandez and Consuelo Jimenez Underwood embed or reimagine her image on artworks that comment on immigration politics. For instance, Ester Hernandez's screen print titled Wanted (2010) and Consuelo Jimenez Underwood's Sacred Jump (1994) and Virgen de los Caminos (1994).[140][141][136] One notable reference in literature to the image and its alleged predecessor, the Aztec Earth goddess Tonantzin, is in Sandra Cisneros' short story \"Little Miracles, Kept Promises\", from her collection Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories (1991). Cisneros' story is constructed out of brief notes that people give Our Lady of Guadalupe in thanks for favors received, which in Cisneros' hands becomes a portrait of an extended Chicano community living throughout Texas. \"Little Miracles\" ends with an extended narrative (pp. 124‚Äì129) of a feminist artist, Rosario \"Chayo\" de Le√≥n, who at first did not allow images of La Virgen de Guadalupe in her home because she associated her with subservience and suffering, particularly by Mexican women. But when she learns that Guadalupe's shrine is built on the same hill in Mexico City that had a shrine to Tonantzin, the Aztec Earth goddess and serpent destroyer, Chayo comes to understand that there's a deep, syncretic connection between the Aztec goddess and the Mexican saint; together they inspire Chayo's new artistic creativity, inner strength, and independence. In Chayo's words, \"I finally understood who you are. No longer Mary the mild, but our mother Tonantzin. Your church at Tepeyac built on the site of her temple\" (128).[142] The image and its alleged apparition was investigated several times, including in the 2013 documentary The Blood & The Rose, directed by Tim Watkins.[143] Drawing on the significance of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Chicano culture, many Chicano artists revere her image and visually reimagine the religious figure within a feminist and contemporary context.[144][145][141] More than just a religious symbol, Chicano artists view Our Lady of Guadalupe as an empowering feminist icon and a proclamation of Indigenous pride. However, these re-envisioned artworks have not been without controversy, as many artists have faced intense backlash from Catholic groups who view these artworks as \"disrespectful and irreverent\".[146] One of the most famous controversies was sparked by Alma L√≥pez's Our Lady digital collage, which later led to a book titled Our Lady of Controversy: Alma L√≥pez's Irreverent Apparition.[147][148] Despite this, Chicano artists such as Yolanda L√≥pez, Alma L√≥pez, Margarita 'Mita' Cuaron, Ester Hern√°ndez, and Consuelo Jimenez Underwood, among others, have used Our Lady of Guadalupe's portrait to explore themes of repression, feminine strength, and to uplift women.[149][150]",

                "content": "Our editors will review what you‚Äôve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Our Lady of Guadalupe, in Roman Catholicism, the Virgin Mary in her appearance before St. Juan Diego in four visions in 1531. The name also refers to the Marian apparition itself. Our Lady of Guadalupe holds a special place in the religious life of Mexico and is one of the most popular religious devotions. Her image, of a woman of mixed Indigenous and European features (mestiza) wearing a turquoise-colored mantle surrounded by a sunburst, has played an important role as a national symbol of Mexico. According to tradition, Mary appeared to Juan Diego, who was an Aztec convert to Christianity, on four occasions between December 9 and December 12, 1531. During her first apparition she requested that a shrine to her be built on the spot where she appeared, Tepeyac Hill (now in a suburb of Mexico City). However, the local bishop hesitated to act on this request. Mary appeared to Juan Diego a second time on December 9 after his meeting that day with the bishop and told him to return and try again. On December 10 Juan Diego met with the bishop, who this time demanded a sign before he would approve construction of a church. Mary then appeared a third time to Juan Diego, who told her of the bishop‚Äôs demand for a sign. On December 12, she made her fourth appearance, ordering Juan Diego to collect roses from the hill and bring them to the bishop. Miraculously, there were roses blooming on the hill, despite it being winter. Moreover, the roses were native to Castile, a region in Spain that was the homeland of the bishop. In his audience with the bishop on that day, Juan Diego opened his tilma (cloak), letting dozens of roses fall to the floor and revealing the image of Mary imprinted on the inside of the cloak‚Äîthe image that is now venerated in the Basilica of Guadalupe. Mary is also said to have appeared to Juan Diego‚Äôs dying uncle, Juan Bernardino, and restored him to health. The traditional view has been questioned by various scholars and ecclesiastics, including the former abbot of the Basilica of Guadalupe. The primary objection is that there is no documentary evidence for the apparition until 1648; critics claim that documents purporting to be from the 16th century are actually from the 17th. Critics have also noted that the bishop approached by Juan Diego was not consecrated until 1534, and he makes no mention of Juan Diego or of Our Lady of Guadalupe in his writings. Defenders of the Virgin of Guadalupe‚Äîincluding Pope John Paul II, who canonized Juan Diego and declared Our Lady of Guadalupe the patroness of the Americas‚Äîaccept the authenticity of the early documents and point also to various oral accounts of the apparition. John Paul II‚Äôs actions were only the latest in a series of developments affirming the importance of Our Lady of Guadalupe. A shrine to the Virgin has existed on the site since at least 1556, when the archbishop of New Spain promoted devotion to the image of Mary at a chapel in Tepeyac. The image was described by an English prisoner in Mexico City in 1568, and by the end of the 16th century Our Lady of Guadalupe formed part of a wide network of shrines to the Virgin throughout Mexico. The story of Mary‚Äôs appearance to Juan Diego was codified in the work of Miquel S√°nchez in 1648, and an account in the Indigenous language (Nahuatl) was published in 1649 and widely accepted as accurate. The devotion continued to grow, especially after Our Lady of Guadalupe was credited with ending a deadly epidemic of hemorrhagic fever that ravaged Mexico City in 1736‚Äì37. In 1737 Our Lady of Guadalupe was proclaimed patroness of Mexico City, and in 1746 her patronage was accepted by all the territories of New Spain, which included part of present-day California as well as Mexico and regions as far south as Guatemala and El Salvador. In 1754 Pope Benedict XIV approved her patronage and granted her a proper feast and mass for December 12. Pope Pius X proclaimed her patroness of Latin America in 1910, and in 1935 Pius XI approved her patronage over the Philippines. Veneration of Our Lady of Guadalupe has been particularly strong among women, especially in Mexico, and since at least the early 18th century the devotion was spread throughout the world by the Jesuits and other religious. Our Lady of Guadalupe‚Äôs role in Mexican history is not limited to religious matters; she has played an important role in Mexican nationalism and identity. In 1810 Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla promoted her as the patroness of the revolt he led against the Spanish. The image of the Virgin of Guadalupe appeared on the rebels‚Äô banners, and the rebels‚Äô battle cry was ‚ÄúLong Live Our Lady of Guadalupe.‚Äù During a religious revival in Mexico in the late 19th century, preachers declared that the foundation of Mexico could be dated to the time of the apparition of Our Lady of Guadalupe, because she freed the people from idolatry and reconciled the Spanish and Indigenous peoples in a common devotion. Emiliano Zapata‚Äôs peasant rebels carried the banner of Our Lady when they entered Mexico City in 1914, and, during the civil war in Mexico in 1926‚Äì29, the banners of the rebels bore her image. Our Lady of Guadalupe‚Äôs continuing significance as a religious and national symbol is attested by the hundreds of thousands of pilgrims who visit her shrine in Mexico City every year. Additionally, the image of her that appears on St. Juan Diego‚Äôs tilma has been interpreted by some scholars as containing elements that hold particular meaning to Mexican and Indigenous people. Notably, these elements combine European Roman Catholic symbolism with imagery from the Aztec religion.",

                "content": "By Francesca Merlo The Virgin of Guadalupe, like the shroud of Turin, appears on a piece of fabric. Both are sacred objects, hundreds of years old, and both depict an image said to be miraculous. The Virgin of Guadalupe was declared Queen of Mexico and is Patron of the Americas. Our Lady of Guadalupe first introduced herself as the Mother of God and the mother of all humanity when she appeared on the hill of Tepeyac in Mexico in 1531. An indigenous peasant, Juan Diego, saw a glowing figure on the hill. After she had identified herself to him, Our Lady asked that Juan build her a shrine in that same spot, in order for her to show and share her love and compassion with all those who believe. Afterwards, Juan Diego visited Juan de Zum√°rraga, who was Archbishop of what is now Mexico City. Zum√°rraga dismissed him in disbelief and asked that the future Saint provide proof of his story and proof of the Lady‚Äôs identity. Juan Diego returned to the hill and encountered Our Lady again. The Virgin told him to climb to the top of the hill and pick some flowers to present to the Archbishop. Although it was winter and nothing should have been in bloom, Juan Diego found an abundance of flowers of a type he had never seen before. The Virgin bundled the flowers into Juan's cloak, known as a tilma. When Juan Diego presented the tilma of exotic flowers to Zum√°rraga, the flowers fell out and he recognised them as Castilian roses, which are not found in Mexico. What was even more significant, however, was that the tilma had been miraculously imprinted with a colorful image of the Virgin herself. This actual tilma, preserved since that date and showing the familiar image of the Virgin Mary with her head bowed and hands together in prayer, represents the Virgin of Guadalupe. It remains perhaps the most sacred object in all of Mexico. The story is best known from a manuscript written in the Aztec‚Äôs native language Nahuatl by the scholar Antonio Valeriano. It was written sometime after 1556. Over 20 million people visit the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe each year, now situated on the very same hill on which she appeared. In 1990, Pope Saint John Paul II visited Mexico and beatified Juan Diego. 10 years later, in the year 2000, he was declared a Saint. Thank you for reading our article.

                "content": "The Story of Our Lady of Guadalupe The feast in honor of Our Lady of Guadalupe goes back to the 16th century. Chronicles of that period tell us the story. A poor Indian named Cuauhtlatohuac was baptized and given the name Juan Diego. He was a 57-year-old widower, and lived in a small village near Mexico City. On Saturday morning December 9, 1531, he was on his way to a nearby barrio to attend Mass in honor of Our Lady. Juan was walking by a hill called Tepeyac when he heard beautiful music like the warbling of birds. A radiant cloud appeared, and within it stood an Indian maiden dressed like an Aztec princess. The lady spoke to him in his own language and sent him to the bishop of Mexico, a Franciscan named Juan de Zumarraga. The bishop was to build a chapel in the place where the lady appeared. Eventually the bishop told Juan to have the lady give him a sign. About this same time Juan‚Äôs uncle became seriously ill. This led poor Juan to try to avoid the lady. Nevertheless the lady found Juan, assured him that his uncle would recover, and provided roses for Juan to carry to the bishop in his cape or tilma. On December 12, when Juan Diego opened his tilma in the bishop‚Äôs presence, the roses fell to the ground, and the bishop sank to his knees. On the tilma where the roses had been appeared an image of Mary exactly as she had appeared at the hill of Tepeyac. Reflection Mary‚Äôs appearance to Juan Diego as one of his people is a powerful reminder that Mary‚Äîand the God who sent her‚Äîaccept all peoples. In the context of the sometimes rude and cruel treatment of the Indians by the Spaniards, the apparition was a rebuke to the Spaniards and an event of vast significance for the indigenous population. While a number of them had converted before this incident, they now came in droves. According to a contemporary chronicler, nine million Indians became Catholic in a very short time. In these days when we hear so much about God‚Äôs preferential option for the poor, Our Lady of Guadalupe cries out to us that God‚Äôs love for and identification with the poor is an age-old truth that stems from the Gospel itself.

        "Social Security Fairness Act Senate vote": [
            {
                "title": "\n    The Social Security Fairness Act has bipartisan support, but time is running out for Senate vote - CBS News",
                "content": "Watch CBS News By Kate Gibson Edited By Anne Marie Lee Updated on: December 11, 2024 / 2:01 PM EST / CBS News The House-passed Social Security Fairness Act enjoys rare bipartisan support on Capitol Hill, yet the odds of it getting enacted are growing smaller with each passing day. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are calling on Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to schedule a vote on the bill that would expand Social Security benefits to roughly 2.8 million retirees. Schumer, a Democrat and cosponsor of the legislation, could invoke a Senate rule that would skip a committee hearing and send the bill directly to a floor vote by the full Senate. On December 10, first responders gathered in Louisville, Kentucky, to call on Republican Senator Mitch McConnell to support to vote on the measure, according to local CBS affiliate WLKY. \"Retirees shouldn't have to choose between paying their bills or buying medication and groceries,\" said Eddie Campbell, president of the Kentucky Education Association. The legislation would eliminate a provision that cuts Social Security payments to some retirees who also collect a pension from jobs not covered by the retirement program. That includes state and federal workers like teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers. It would also end a second provision that reduces Social Security benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members. \"With just eight legislative days remaining in the 118th Congress, Sen. Schumer, a cosponsor of Senate bill S.597, must now step up and take action. It's time for him to follow through and bring it to the floor for a vote,\" Shannon Benton executive director of The Senior Citizens League (TSCL), told CBS MoneyWatch on Friday. The Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) \"penalize families across the country who worked a public service job for part of their career with a separate pension,\" Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy told colleagues earlier in the week. When those workers \"have second jobs, second careers or get married, they receive less from Social Security than if they had never worked in public service at all. That's not right.\" In an impassioned speech, Cassidy called on Schumer to schedule a vote, saying lawmakers would approve the legislation. \"If Schumer brings it up, it'll pass,\" Cassidy stated of the bill, which has 62 sponsors. A similar plea was also made by New York Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who late last month held a press conference to urge passage of the measure. \"Retired teachers &firefighters deserve access to the Social Security benefits they've earned. That's why I'm working to repeal provisions that unfairly reduce Social Security benefits for public servants. Let's get it done!\" Gillibrand also posted on social media. Introduced by Reps. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., and Garret Graves, R-La., the bill was passed by the House on Nov. 11 in a 327-75 vote. The following day, Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown and Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins, wrote to Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican of Kentucky, urging action. \"You have the opportunity to bring this bill across the finish line,\" they stated in a letter. Various forms of the measure have been introduced over the years, but like many legislative proposals, they had failed to get enacted. \"I've been working at the league 25 years, and I don't remember ever not having a version,\" said Benton. \"There is so much momentum, if it doesn't get passed now, a lot of people will lose hope.\" Schumer did not respond to requests for comment. \"His office will probably say something about not having time because of the confirmation hearings, etc. We say, 'Add a day to the schedule.' It's been done before,\" Benton said. Kate Gibson is a reporter for CBS MoneyWatch in New York, where she covers business and consumer finance. ¬© 2024 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Today, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 82, the Social Security Fairness Act, by a vote of 327 to 75. H.R. 82 has been a top priority for the IAFF. The bill eliminates the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO), provisions that unfairly punish retired fire fighters, police officers, teachers, and other public servants. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs vote was a major step toward ensuring fire fighters and other public servants receive the full retirement they‚Äôve earned and paid for,‚Äù said General President Edward A. Kelly. ‚ÄúWhile we‚Äôre proud of the work our team did to get this bill through the House, this is only half the battle. Now it‚Äôs time for Senators to step up and send this bill to the President‚Äôs desk.‚Äù The vote on the House floor was the culmination of a multi-year effort by the IAFF, which worked closely with lawmakers and their staff to stress the impact these unfair penalties have on fire fighters and emergency medical workers. Despite H.R. 82 being one of the most bipartisan bills introduced in the 118th Congress, the bill has been stalled in the powerful House Ways and Means Committee for nearly two years. Many believed that the bill‚Äôs detractors would successfully prevent it from coming up for a vote of the whole House. In September, the IAFF, along with Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-V.A.) and Rep. Garret Graves (R-L.A.) ‚Äì the bill‚Äôs leading sponsors ‚Äì led a successful discharge petition on H.R. 82. Discharge efforts give lawmakers a chance to bypass the committee of jurisdiction and send a bill directly to the House floor. While discharge petitions are rarely successful, 171 Democrats and 47 Republicans agreed to discharge the Social Security Fairness Act. While we‚Äôre proud of the work our team did to get this bill through the House, this is only half the battle. Now it‚Äôs time for Senators to step up and send this bill to the President‚Äôs desk. Now that H.R. 82 has passed the House, the bill moves to the Senate. Unlike the House, where the majority party can move legislation through the body relatively quickly if they have the votes, the Senate gives each Senator unique powers to slow down the legislative process. These powers include the right to offer amendments to legislation, and the right to speak on a bill. Because of this, the Senate must vote to end debate on a bill before it can be finally voted on and passed. This process, known as invoking cloture, requires a 60-vote threshold. Currently, the Senate version of the Social Security Fairness Act has 62 co-sponsors, meaning if all those who have co-sponsored the bill vote to invoke cloture, a vote on final passage would be guaranteed. The IAFF is asking all members to join the fight to pass WEP/GPO repeal. Senators need to hear directly from those most impacted by these unfair penalties. ‚ÄúNow is the time to make our voices heard to the Senate,‚Äù said Kelly. ‚ÄúOur fire fighters, emergency medical workers, and other dedicated public servants deserve to retire with dignity. Repealing the WEP/GPO helps ensure that.‚Äù Contact your Senators through the IAFF‚Äôs Advocacy Center and tell them to support the Social Security Fairness Act. Privacy Policy | ¬© 2024 IAFF.

                "content": "Manage your account Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer committed Wednesday to hold a vote on a Social Security bill to repeal the penalty on public servants before the current Congress ends Dec. 20. Schumer told a group of teachers, firefighters and other public servants during a labor union rally at Upper Senate Park that the Senate will take action on the bill that would benefit about 90,000 Louisiana retirees and spouses. The 1980s-era Windfall Elimination Penalty and Government Pension Offset prevent about 2.8 million government retirees nationwide who earned pensions from those careers from collecting their full Social Security benefits earned while working outside of government. House Resolution 82 ‚Äî the Social Security Fairness Act ‚Äî by Republican Louisiana Rep. Garrett Graves of Baton Rouge and Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia already was approved by the House in November on a bipartisan vote of 327-75. \"The Senate Majority Leader has called for a vote on our bill H.R. 82 provided he gets the necessary 60 votes to get it to the floor,\" Graves said in a text statement to USA Today Network. \"More than 60 Senators support our Social Security Fairness Act. \"In the House we have labored for years to build a coalition, resulting in the most cosponsored bill in the Congress. We defied the odds and fought back sneak attacks to successfully complete a discharge petition that resulted in the first vote in history to repeal the WEP and GPO. The heavy lifting is done. The path to victory could not be clearer. A WEP-GPO repeal could be in the stockings of millions of public services retirees this Christmas.\" Republican Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy is among those in the Senate advocating for the bill. He delivered a floor speech last week calling for a vote. \"I'm absolutely working to get a vote on the floor with this,\" Cassidy said Tuesday. Opponents of the effort to remove WEP and GPO restrictions argue that repealing the current law will increase the strain already placed on Social Security and its future viability.

                "content": "The Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball program is the men's college basketball team of the University of Kentucky. It has eight NCAA championships, the best all-time winning percentage, and the most all-time victories.[2] The Wildcats compete in the Southeastern Conference and are coached by Mark Pope.[3] Adolph Rupp first brought Kentucky to national prominence, winning four NCAA titles. Since then, Joe B. Hall, Rick Pitino, Tubby Smith, and John Calipari each won a national championship, making Kentucky the only school with five coaches to win NCAA championships and placing it second only to UCLA for most titles. Kentucky has finished as the NCAA runner-up four times, making it tied with UCLA and North Carolina for all-time title game appearances at 12. The program has played in 17 NCAA Final Fours, tying Duke for third-all time behind North Carolina and UCLA. Kentucky leads all schools in several NCAA tournament stats: Elite Eight appearances at 38, Sweet Sixteen appearances at 45, total NCAA tournament appearances at 60, and tournament games played at 184. The program is behind only North Carolina with 131 NCAA tournament wins, North Carolina has 132. Kentucky has also won the National Invitation Tournament twice, making it the only school to win multiple NCAA and NIT championships, and it leads all schools in total postseason appearances at 68. Additionally, the Helms Athletic Foundation declared Kentucky the 1933 and 1954 national champions, the latter being Kentucky's only undefeated team in the modern era (post-1930). The 1948 NCAA champion team, coached by Rupp, represented the United States in the Olympics and won a gold medal. Kentucky was the first program to 1000 wins in 1968 and the first to 2000 wins in 2009. The program leads all schools with sixty-three 20-win seasons, sixteen 30-win seasons, and six 35-win seasons. Additionally, Kentucky is second among all teams in conference regular season championships with 53. Throughout its history, the Kentucky basketball program has featured many notable and successful players, both on the collegiate level and the professional level. Five players have been named national player of the year, with Anthony Davis in 2012 and Oscar Tshiebwe in 2022 being consensus selections. Three players have been named national freshman of the year: John Wall in 2010, Davis in 2012, and Reed Sheppard in 2024. Thirty-nine players have been selected as All-Americans a total of 51 times. Kentucky holds the record for the most overall NBA Draft selections (128) and three Wildcats have been selected as the first overall pick (Wall, Davis, and Karl-Anthony Towns). Thirty-nine players have been honored with jersey retirements, as well as Rupp, Hall, Pitino, Smith, equipment manager Bill Keightly, and broadcaster Cawood Ledford. Seven players have been enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame, as well as Rupp, Pitino, Calipari, Eddie Sutton, and Ledford. During Kentucky's earliest seasons the program went through multiple coaches, with the majority staying only one or two seasons. Records indicate that the first head coach of the Wildcats was W. W. H. Mustaine, who in 1903 called together some students, took up a collection totaling $3 for a ball, and told the students to start playing.[4] The first recorded intercollegiate game at the college was a 15‚Äì6 defeat to nearby Georgetown College. The team went 1‚Äì2 for their first \"season\", also losing to Kentucky University (later Transylvania University) but defeating the Lexington YMCA.[5] Through 1908, the team did not manage a winning season, and had an all-time record of 15‚Äì29. In the fall of that year a full-time head coach was hired, Edwin Sweetland. This made him the first paid coach in Kentucky's basketball history.[6] That year, the team went 5‚Äì4, and only three years later, boasted their first undefeated season with nine victories and no losses.[7] The 1914 team under Alpha Brummage, led by brothers Karl and Tom Zerfoss, went 12‚Äì2 and defeated all its Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association opponents. In 1919, George Buchheit became the new head coach of the Wildcats. An alumnus of the University of Illinois, he brought with him a new system of basketball. The \"Buchheit system\" or \"Illinois system\", focused on defense and featured one player standing under each basket, while three roamed the court. Bucheit varied the system he learned in Illinois in one important way. While the Illinois system employed a zone defense, Buchheit's system used an aggressive man-to-man scheme. On offense, he used a complicated system of passing called the \"zig-zag\" or \"figure eight\" offense.[8] Although the team had a losing season in Buchheit's first year, they won the first-ever Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association tournament the next year, defeating the heavily favored Georgia Bulldogs. Both of these teams were composed entirely of native Kentuckians, anchored by All-American Basil Hayden. The tournament victory was considered Kentucky's first major success, and the 1921 team became known as the \"Wonder Team.\"[9] In 1922, the team was unable to build on the success of the \"Wonder Team.\" Although every player was eligible in 1922, two key players, Hayden and Sam Ridgeway, were injured before the start of the season. Hayden returned from his knee injury during the season, but was never able to play at the level he had the previous year. Ridgeway fought a year-long battle with diphtheria, and although he recovered, never played for the Wildcats again. The remaining three members of the \"Wonder Team\" went 9‚Äì5 for the season, and bowed out of the SIAA tournament in the second round.[10] Buchheit remained as coach through the 1924 season before moving on to coach Trinity College (later Duke University). A different coach would guide the team for each of the next four years. C.O. Applegran immediately followed Buchheit, and his 1925 team posted a respectable 13‚Äì8 record. Applegran in college had played for the University of Illinois, where he became an All-American. The next year, Ray Eklund led the team to a 15‚Äì3 record, and produced UK's second All-American, Burgess Carey.[11] The record was enough for Kentucky to win their first regular season conference championship in the Southern Conference. Seeing the cupboard largely bare for the upcoming year, Eklund resigned shortly before the start of the 1927 season. The team scrambled to find a new coach, and former player Basil Hayden left his coaching job at Kentucky Wesleyan College to answer the call. An inexperienced coach and a roster largely depleted of talent left the Wildcats with a 3‚Äì13 record that year. The disappointment convinced Hayden that he wasn't the \"coaching type\", and he resigned after the season. Fortunately for the Wildcats, 1927 would be their last losing season for six decades.[12] The Wildcats' new coach for the 1927‚Äì28 season was John Mauer. Although he had a talented group of players moving up from the junior varsity team, Mauer quickly discovered that his players did not know the fundamentals of the game. He began a regimen of three-hour practices five days a week during the preseason. The practice began with half an hour of shooting drills and usually ended with a full-court scrimmage. Between the two, Mauer worked on skill drills and scenarios. Mauer's teams were nicknamed the \"Mauermen.\"[13] Teamwork was the hallmark of Mauer's system. Every player worked on every aspect of the game; there were no specialists. Like Buchheit, Mauer employed a strong man-to-man defense. He utilized a slow-break offense that relied on a complicated system of short passes to get a good shot. Two elements of Mauer's system were new to basketball in the south ‚Äì the offensive screen and the bounce pass. The latter was so new to most of UK's opponents that it was referred to as the \"submarine attack.\"[14] Over his three-year tenure, Mauer led the Wildcats to an overall record of 40‚Äì14. One major prize eluded him, however. Despite having teams that were almost universally acknowledged as the \"class of the South\", Mauer never led a team to the Southern Conference title. Despite his innate ability for coaching, Mauer lacked the ability to heighten his team's emotions for a big game, a fault that was cited as the reason for his lack of tournament success. Mauer left the Wildcats to coach the Miami University Redskins following the 1930 season.[15] In 1930, the university hired Adolph Rupp, who had played as a reserve for the University of Kansas 1922 and 1923 Helms National Championship teams,[16] under coach Forest C. \"Phog\" Allen. At the time of his hiring, Rupp was a high school coach in Freeport, Illinois.[4] Rupp coached the University of Kentucky men's basketball team from 1930 to 1972. There, he gained the nicknames, \"Baron of the Bluegrass\", and \"The Man in the Brown Suit\". Rupp, who was an early innovator of the fast break and set offense, gained a reputation as an intense competitor, a strict motivator, and strategist. Rupp's Wildcat teams won 4 NCAA championships (1948, 1949, 1951, 1958), one NIT title in 1946, appeared in 20 NCAA tournaments, had 6 NCAA Final Four appearances, captured 27 Southeastern Conference (SEC) regular season titles, and won 13 SEC tournaments. Rupp's Kentucky teams also finished ranked No. 1 on 6 occasions in the final Associated Press college basketball poll and 4 times in the United Press International (Coaches) poll. In addition, Rupp's 1966 Kentucky squad (nicknamed \"Rupp's Runts\", as no starting player on the squad was taller than 6'5\") finished runner-up in the NCAA tournament, and his 1947 Wildcats finished runner-up in the NIT. Rupp's 1933 and 1954 Kentucky squads were also awarded the Helms National Championship, and his 1934 and 1947 teams were retroactively recognized as the national champion by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.[17][18][19][20] Rupp gave the '44 team the nickname \"the Beardless Wonders\" and \"Wildkittens\" because according to Rupp, \"It was like running a Kindergarten\".[citation needed] Of the young players, Kentucky's best player was freshman Chad Anderson who, at the age of 17, was named consensus All-American, making him the youngest player to ever earn the title. The Beardless Wonders won 19 of their 21 games, enough to be invited into the NIT. There they were matched up with a Utah team nicknamed the \"Blitz Kids\".[citation needed] Both teams went into the half tied at 24, but with the help of Brannum Kentucky pulled away to win 46‚Äì38. Kentucky lost the next game to home town Saint John's.[citation needed] On the way to its first NCAA title, Kentucky went on to a record of 36‚Äì3. Of these three losses, all were either away or at neutral sites, keeping Kentucky undefeated at home throughout the entire season. Kentucky started off the beginning of the season with a 7‚Äì0 record heading into their away game at Temple. However, Temple was able to give the Cats their first loss by one point, 60‚Äì59. But the Wildcats rolled off an 11-win streak before playing at Notre Dame, where they lost 55‚Äì64. They did not lose a game for the rest of the regular season. Kentucky continued through the NCAA tournament to the finals, where they faced the Baylor Bears. Kentucky won its first NCAA title in a decisive 58‚Äì42 victory. The season did not end after the NCAA tournament, as Kentucky who would play in the Olympic Trials, where they went 2‚Äì1, only losing to the Phillips Oilers once. This was performance enough to represent the United States in the 1948 Olympic Games. Despite only being a college team, the starting 5 of Kentucky defeated all of its competition in London, making Kentucky the only team to win both an NCAA title and an Olympic gold medal.[citation needed] Adolph Rupp soon gave this team the nickname \"The Fabulous Five\", in honor of their accomplishments.[citation needed][21] For the 1949 season Kentucky had high expectations with most of the Fabulous Five returning. Big Blue Nation's expectations were met as the 1949 team won one more game than the previous year including both a SEC regular season and SEC tournament championship, while also getting back to the Final Four that March. In the finals Kentucky faced the Oklahoma A&M Cowboys, a team that had previously seen success in the tournament with back-to-back championships in 1945 and 1946. The Fab Five would succeed again winning 46‚Äì36 and Kentucky's only back-to-back NCAA championship. Kentucky was the second program in NCAA history to win back-to-back championships (there have been six other schools since). With a returning star player like Bill Spivey, Kentucky hoped to carry their success into the new decade. The Wildcats lost their first game by 11 to Saint John's at home, but they would pull it together for the Sugar Bowl Tournament, which they won, beating NCAA runner-up Bradley. After losing to Tennessee, Kentucky struggled to chain two wins together, losing every other game. They defeated their next 14 opponents, including getting revenge in SEC tournament championship over Tennessee. Heading into the post-season, No. 3 Kentucky played CCNY in the NIT, missing the NCAA tournament. The Wildcats were no match and were thrashed by the CCNY Beavers, 50‚Äì83. Over the season Kentucky defeated four top 10 teams, and were ranked in the top 5 the entire season. Vanderbilt, however, knocked off the top ranked Wildcats in the SEC tournament finals denying them an eighth straight SEC tournament title. Kentucky then defeated fourth ranked Kansas State 68‚Äì58 in the NCAA finals, . Adolph Rupp was the head coach at Kentucky during the year of the point-shaving scandal of 1951. In 1945 former Kentucky football player Nick Englisis met Kentucky player Ralph Beard while the two played football at Kentucky. Englisis entered the gambling business when he left the football team in 1946, then approached three Kentucky basketball players Ralph Beard, Alex Groza, and Dale Barnstable with his associates in late 1948 about potentially point shaving (fixing the score of games) during the upcoming season in exchange for money. The three players agreed to point shave and successfully shaved points in several games during the 1948‚Äì1949 season until an effort to point shave caused the Wildcats to lose to the Loyola Ramblers in the National Invitation Tournament. Groza, Beard, and Barnstable attempted to win the game under the point spread but kept the score too close, allowing the Ramblers to win the game with an impressive performance at the end of the second half. Kentucky faced Villanova in their first game of the NCAA tournament following the loss to Loyola and the three players attempted to win over the point spread. When Groza, Beard, and Barnstable failed to win over the point spread, it caused Englisis to lose all of his money and ended the point shaving deals between Englisis and these three players.[22] On October 20, 1951, Alex Groza, Ralph Beard, and Dale Barnstable were arrested for taking bribes from gamblers to shave points during several games including the National Invitation Tournament game against the Loyola Ramblers in the 1948‚Äì49 season.[23][24] At the conclusion of this scandal, a subsequent NCAA investigation found that Kentucky had committed several rule violations, including giving illegal spending money to players on several occasions, and also allowing some ineligible athletes to compete.[24] As a result, the Southeastern Conference voted to ban Kentucky from competing for a year and the NCAA requested all other basketball-playing members not to schedule Kentucky, with eventually none doing so.[25] As a result of these actions, Kentucky was forced to cancel the entire 1952‚Äì53 basketball season. Years later, Walter Byers, the first executive director of the NCAA, unofficially referred to this punishment as the first de facto NCAA death penalty, despite the current rule first coming into effect in 1985, thus the NCAA having no such enforcement power previous to that.[26][27] Echoing Mr. Byers' view, the NCAA's official stance is very much the same, and they now state in hindsight, \"In effect, it was the Association's first death penalty, though its enforcement was binding only through constitutional language that required members to compete against only those schools that were compliant with NCAA rules. Despite fears that it would resist, Kentucky accepts the penalty and, in turn, gives the NCAA credibility to enforce its rules.\" [28] The team posted a perfect 25‚Äì0 record in the next year (Rupp's only undefeated season), for which it was awarded the 1954 Helms National Championship. In addition, Kentucky also finished ranked No. 1 in the final Associated Press poll. On the team were three players who had graduated at the conclusion of the previous academic year. When, at the last minute, the NCAA ruled these players ineligible from post-season play, Rupp decided to skip the 1954 NCAA Tournament in protest.[citation needed] The \"Fiddlin' Five\" team earned their name though playing around and mistakes, which Rupp described as fiddling. The Fiddlin' Five still has the most losses out of any Kentucky's championships, with six, three of those were in four games.[citation needed] Unlike the Fab Five or the 1951 teams, the Fiddling Five would yoyo in the rankings with their lowest a No. 13 coming after 56‚Äì57 loss to unranked Loyola Chicago. Kentucky improved through the tournament though, and won their fourth title over No. 18 Seattle in the confines of Louisville's Freedom Hall. Rupp's last Final Four team and one of his last chances at a 5th NCAA title occurred in the 1965‚Äì66 season, with Kentucky going all the way to the NCAA title game. The 1966 NCAA championship game against Texas Western (now University of Texas-El Paso or UTEP) marked the first occurrence that an all-white starting five (Kentucky) played an all-black starting five (Texas Western) in the NCAA championship game.[citation needed] Texas Western won the game 72‚Äì65, on the night of March 19, 1966. Kentucky entered the tournament with only one loss and ranked No. 1, Texas Western also had only one loss and entered the tournament ranked second. Kentucky was a 6.5 point favorite in the game[29] The game was depicted in the film Glory Road.[citation needed] This game, and the result of it, were especially significant as the game came at a time when the civil rights movement was coming into full swing around the country. In 1969, after actively recruiting black players for over six years (his first formal scholarship offer was to Wes Unseld in 1964), despite most of the other SEC teams threatening to boycott if a black player took the court), Rupp finally signed his first black player, Tom Payne, an athletic 7'-1\" center out of Louisville. This ended the aspect of all-white Kentucky teams forever, and marked a new era with many notable black Kentucky basketball legends, including Jack Givens, Sam Bowie, Kenny Walker, Jamal Mashburn, Tayshaun Prince, Rajon Rondo, John Wall, Anthony Davis, and Karl Anthony Towns.[30] The late Rupp years looked promising with Dan Issel's commitment to the Wildcats in 1966. Over the next four years Issel scored an average of 25.7 per game, adding up to 2,137 points in his college career. This made Issel the player with the most points to ever play at Kentucky, a feat that has not been matched to this day. This included his 53 points scored against Mississippi State in 1970, the most by a Kentucky player in a single game until Jodie Meeks made 54 against rival Tennessee on January 13, 2009. Issel did not capture the national championship in his college years, but would go on to make a name for himself in the ABA.[citation needed] After 1966 Rupp saw continued success, but the Final Four eluded him. The Wildcats ended with a 13‚Äì13 season and missed the tournament altogether in 1967, then reach the Elite Eight and Sweet Sixteen in the next two years. Ranked #1 in the nation with a 26‚Äì1 record overall, Kentucky nearly missed a Final Four berth in a 106‚Äì100 shootout against Jacksonville. [citation needed] Rupp was forced into retirement in March 1972, after reaching age 70. At the time, this was the mandatory retirement age for all University of Kentucky employees. He was a 5-time National Coach-of-the-Year award winner, a 7-time Conference Coach-of-the-Year award winner, and was elected a member of both the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and College Basketball Hall of Fame. Further, since 1972, the Adolph Rupp Trophy, considered one of the nation's premier basketball awards, has been given by Commonwealth Athletic Club to the nation's top men's college basketball player. In addition, the University of Kentucky retired a jersey in his honor in the rafters of Rupp Arena, a 23,500-seat arena named after him, dedicated in 1976.[17][18] Joe B. Hall was the head basketball coach at Kentucky from 1972 to 1985. Although he had been an assistant at Kentucky since 1965, Coach Hall was given a difficult task: to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor, Adolph Rupp. In the 1978 NCAA tournament, he coached the Wildcats to their fifth NCAA championship. He was named National Coach of the Year in 1978 and SEC Coach of the Year on four occasions. His record at UK was 297‚Äì100, and 373‚Äì156 over his career. Coach Hall won the title once in 1978, as well as making the final four in 1975 and 1984, and the elite eight in 1972, 1973, 1977, 1983.[citation needed] Coach Hall is one of only three men to both play on an NCAA championship team (1949‚Äì Kentucky) and coach an NCAA championship team (1978‚Äì Kentucky), and the only one to do so for the same school.[citation needed] The only others to achieve this feat are: After a year of playing in the freshman league and a disappointing sophomore season, Hall's Super Kittens returned with hopes of finally bringing Kentucky its fifth title. They nearly did just that, guiding Kentucky to a runner-up finish to UCLA in the 1975 NCAA tournament but not before avenging their 20-point defeat to an undefeated Indiana team. Despite losing in the championship game, it would give freshman Jack Givens a taste for success that would help propel Kentucky to the title three years later. It had been 20 years without a championship in Lexington, and along with pressure of following a hall of fame coach, Hall would nickname the 1978 season the \"Season Without Celebration.\" The pressure to win was immense on both players and coach to bring home the title, especially with a senior laden team that had gone to the finals as freshmen. Kentucky would hardly lose its composure all season or break under pressure, winning 30 of 32 games and defeating eight ranked teams along the way. By the time Kentucky reached the tournament finals they seemed bound to win the title, though Duke would give Kentucky their all. With the help of senior Jack \"Goose\" Givens' 41 points, Kentucky defeated the Blue Devils 94‚Äì88, and finally won their fifth title and first in 20 years. In 1985, Eddie Sutton succeeded Joe B. Hall. He coached the Wildcats for four years, leading them to the Elite Eight of the 1986 NCAA tournament. Two seasons later, Sutton and the 25‚Äì5 Wildcats captured their 37th SEC title and were ranked as the 6th college basketball team in the nation by the Associated Press and UPI[31][32] before losing to Villanova in the Tournament. Kentucky entered the 1988‚Äì89 season with a gutted roster. Ed Davender, Robert Lock and Winston Bennett had all graduated from school, while All-SEC sophomore Rex Chapman left school early to enter the 1988 NBA draft. Additionally, sophomore standout Eric Manuel was suspected of cheating on his college entrance exam and voluntarily agreed to sit out until the investigation was finished. Potential franchise recruit Shawn Kemp transferred out of Kentucky after signing with the school early that year.[33] Unfortunately, Manuel was forced to sit out the entire season as the investigation dragged on, essentially leaving the Wildcats in the hands of inexperienced sophomore LeRon Ellis and true freshman Chris Mills. The two underclassmen struggled to fill the talent vacuum on the court and the Wildcats finished with a losing record of 13‚Äì19, the team's first losing full-season record since 1927.[32] To add insult to injury, the NCAA announced at the end of the season that its investigation into the basketball program had found the school guilty of violating numerous NCAA policies.[34] The scandal broke when Emery Worldwide employees claimed to have discovered $1,000 in cash in an envelope Kentucky assistant coach Dwane Casey sent to Mills' father.[35] Later Emery settled a libel lawsuit filed by Casey for a substantial amount of money. Casey was not in Lexington when the envelope was supposedly mailed and the father of Mills said they received no money. The NCAA rescinded its show cause order immediately after the settlement of the lawsuit, and Casey's career has flourished as an NBA coach.[36] Another player, Eric Manuel, was alleged to have received improper assistance on his college entrance exams and was banned from NCAA competition. Whether Manuel was directly involved has been questioned.[37] Kentucky was already on probation stemming from allegations of an extensive scheme of payments to recruits, and the NCAA seriously considered hitting the Wildcats with the \"death penalty\", which would have shut down the entire basketball program (as opposed to simply being banned from postseason play) for up to two years. However, school president David Roselle forced Sutton and athletic director Cliff Hagan to resign. The Wildcats were slapped with three years' probation, a two-year ban from postseason play, the vacating of their two NCAA tournament wins in the 1988 season, and a ban from live television in 1989‚Äì90.[38][39] In 1989, Rick Pitino left the NBA's New York Knicks and became the coach at a Kentucky program reeling from the aforementioned scandal. Kentucky would be banned from the 1990 and 1991 post season, with the 1990 season suffering a 14‚Äì14 record. Kentucky would improve in 1991 with a beavy of home-grown upperclassmen such as Sean Woods, John Pelphrey, Richie Farmer, Deron Feldhaus, and Reggie Hanson along with the talented freshman Jamal Mashburn. Despite their record of 22‚Äì6, Kentucky was still banned from the post season and would have to wait another year to see the Unforgettables succeed in the tournament. Beginning with the 1992 season, Kentucky was free of post season bans. Though they lost one more game than last season, this team was most memorable for going to the Elite Eight (for the first time since Sutton's 1986 team) with many returning upperclassmen from Kentucky. The team is also known for playing in what could be considered one of the greatest games in NCAA tournament history against Duke. In this game defending champion Duke were looking to return to the Final Four once again, Kentucky for the first time in almost a decade. The game was hard-fought and physical on both sides all game including Laettner's infamous stomp on Aminu Timberlake, which resulted in a technical. The teams took the lead back and forth until the final minute of the game which resulted in a first buzzer beater shot by Kentucky's Sean Woods to take the lead 103‚Äì102, and then Laettner's shot to win the game for the Blue Devils in the final seconds 104‚Äì103. This team came to be known as the \"Unforgettables\" for helping put Kentucky back on the path to success in the 1990s and because the team was made up of home grown Kentucky kids. Kentucky returned a junior Mashburn, along with Travis Ford and Tony Delk. They were expected to reach the Final Four for the first time since Joe B. Hall's 1984 team. The expectations were right, as Kentucky would head into the post-season with only 2 losses and a No. 5 ranking. After winning the SEC Tournament once again, Kentucky stormed to the NCAA Final Four to meet up with Michigan's \"Fab Five\" a team of young and highly talented recruits that brought Michigan to the championship game the year before. As talented as Kentucky was they would fail to reach the championship game with a 78‚Äì81 overtime loss to the Wolverines. But this would be the just a glimpse of a run Kentucky would have later in the decade. Kentucky started the next season ranked #1 but would underachieve, falling short of the Elite Eight for the only time under Pitino. The highlight of the season was the \"Mardi Gras Miracle\", a game where Kentucky trailed LSU 68‚Äì37 with 15:34 left, but outscored them 62‚Äì27 over the remainder of regulation to win 99‚Äì95.[40] Starting in 1996, Kentucky would put together a string of Final Fours with help from 9 future NBA players. The \"Untouchables\" as they were nicknamed, would only lose twice, to Final Four bound UMass Minutemen (coached by former Kentucky coach John Calipari) and Mississippi State. It was with their overwhelming talent and chemistry that would win Kentucky their sixth national title in the 1996 NCAA tournament, Kentucky's first NCAA championship in 18 years. The following year, Pitino's Kentucky team made it back to the national title game, losing to Arizona in overtime in the finals of the 1997 NCAA tournament. Pitino's fast-paced teams at Kentucky were favorites of the school's fans. It was primarily at Kentucky where he implemented his signature style of full-court pressure defense. By the end of the Pitino era, Kentucky went from banned from the post season to going to three of the last five Final Fours and five of the last six Elite Eights. For this the 1997 team was dubbed the \"Unbelievables\" for taking a team that was not expected much of to return the Wildcats back to the championship game for a second time. Pitino left Kentucky in 1997 to coach the NBA's Boston Celtics, he then went on to coach Kentucky's in-state rival, the University of Louisville. Orlando \"Tubby\" Smith was introduced by UK Athletic Director C.M. Newton as the Wildcats' 20th head coach on May 12, 1997, charged with the unenviable task of replacing popular coach Rick Pitino. The Wildcats were at the top of the basketball world at the time, having won a national title in 1996 and, according to many, missing a second straight title in 1997 by the torn ACL of shooting guard Derek Anderson.[41] (Anderson tore his ACL in January against SEC foe Auburn; Kentucky lost the 1997 title game in overtime to the Arizona Wildcats.) The team Smith inherited sported seven players from the Arizona loss, and five from the 1996 championship team. However, since most of the players who had left after the 1996 and 1997 seasons were high NBA draft picks, his team had the lowest pre-season ranking since Kentucky came off probation in 1991.[42] In his first season at UK, he coached the Wildcats to their seventh NCAA championship, including a come-from-behind victory against Duke in the Elite Eight, and another comeback win against Stanford, then Utah in the Finals. His 1998 National Championship is unique in modern times, as being along with 1985 Villanova the 2nd team in over 20 years to win without a First Team All American or future NBA Lottery Pick (see 1998 NCAA tournament). The 1998 team was also unlike Kentucky's past two championship teams, often falling behind in games before roaring back to win rather than dominating their competition. Smith's teams, known primarily for a ball line defense-oriented slower style of play coined \"Tubbyball\", received mixed reviews among Kentucky fans who have historically enjoyed a faster, higher-scoring style of play under previous coaches. Smith was also under pressure from Kentucky fans to recruit better players. After leading Kentucky to one National Championship in 1998, Kentucky would complete a perfect 16‚Äì0 regular season conference record in 2003, win five SEC regular season championships (1998, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2005) and five SEC Tournament titles (1998, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2004). Smith led the Wildcats to six Sweet Sixteen appearances (1998, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005) and four Elite Eight appearances (1998, 1999, 2003, 2005) in his ten seasons. He totaled 100 wins quicker than any other Wildcat coach before him except Hall of Famer Adolph Rupp, reaching the plateau in 130 games (John Calipari subsequently broke this record in 114 games). In 2003, he was named AP College Coach of the Year. In 1998, the reserve guard J.P. Blevins scored 9 points, all on 3-pointers sparking the Wildcats to come back from a 15-point deficit in the first half to upset the number 5 seed, Michigan State 60‚Äì58. Averaging only 2.2 points a game all season, Blevins was the unlikely hero for the Wildcats who were 6‚Äì4, to give the Spartans who were 8-3 an unlikely upset. Especially since they fell behind 26‚Äì11 in the first half.[43] Although Smith compiled an impressive resume during his UK career, he came under considerable pressure from many UK fans, who believed that his failure to achieve even a single Final Four appearance in his last nine seasons was inadequate by UK standards. He was infamously dubbed \"Ten Loss Tubby\" by several disgruntled UK fans. Smith's Final Four drought is the longest of any coach in UK history,[44] although Smith did come just a double-overtime loss short of another Final Four appearance in 2005. On March 22, 2007, Smith resigned his position of UK Head Coach to accept the head coach position at the University of Minnesota.[45] On April 6, 2007, Billy Gillispie was formally announced as the new head coach of the University of Kentucky by UK athletic director Mitch Barnhart. He fielded questions from the media during the press conference held at UK's new practice facility, the Joe Craft Center. He expressed his excitement and joy to be not only considered for the position but to have been given the honor and the opportunity to coach what former UK coach Rick Pitino referred to as the \"Roman Empire\" of college basketball. \"I'm very, very grateful and honored to be here, but we have a lot of work to do.\"[46] Gillispie became only the sixth head coach in the last 76 years at the school.[47] Gillispie's second season again started out rocky in 2008 as the 'Cats fell to Virginia Military Institute in their season opener. The second game of the season saw the Wildcats fall to North Carolina by 19 points. UK rebounded to win 11 of their next 12 games, improving their record to 11‚Äì3. On January 4, the Wildcats lost a heart breaker to archrival Louisville 74‚Äì71 after a 25 ft. shot by Edgar Sosa with 2.3 seconds remaining in the game. Prior to the shot, UK was down 7 with 38.5 seconds left, and Jodie Meeks was fouled shooting a three, proceeded to make all three free throw shots, Patrick Patterson stole an inbound and passed it to Meeks who laid it in to bring the game to 71‚Äì69 with 29.6 left, and then an inbound pass went long and Meeks snatched the pass, drove to the hoop and was fouled, and then made both free throws to tie the game at 71 with 22.9 left. So all in all, UK and Meeks got seven points in about 15 seconds to tie the game.[48] Kentucky disposed of Vanderbilt to win their SEC opener on January 10, 70‚Äì60. On January 13, in a road game against Tennessee, Jodie Meeks set a new Kentucky scoring record by dropping 54 points on the Volunteers. This total bested Dan Issel's 39-year-old scoring record by 1 point, and propelled UK to a 90‚Äì72 win and 2‚Äì0 start in conference play.[49] Kentucky followed up this effort with a 68‚Äì45 victory at Georgia, improving to 14‚Äì4 on the season. With wins over Auburn and Alabama, Kentucky moved to 5‚Äì0 in the SEC. On January 26, UK was ranked in the AP Poll (24th) for the first time since week 1 of the 2007‚Äì08 season.[50] UK promptly dropped 3 in a row (to Ole Miss, South Carolina, and Mississippi State) before rebounding at home with a thrilling 68‚Äì65 win over Florida. Jodie Meeks scored 23 points in the contest, including the fade-away contested 3-point basket with less than 5 seconds remaining to seal the win for UK. On Valentine's Day Kentucky handily defeated Arkansas at Bud Walton Arena 79‚Äì63 behind another strong performance from Meeks. Meeks contributed 45 points and helped UK win despite the absence of Patrick Patterson (sprained ankle). With the win, UK remained tied with South Carolina and Tennessee for 1st in the SEC East at 7‚Äì3.[51] Following the win UK completely collapsed, losing 5 of its last 6 games to finish the regular season 19‚Äì12 with an 8‚Äì8 SEC record. Entering the SEC tournament many felt UK would need to win the championship game to get into the NCAA tournament, but UK was defeated in the second game vs. LSU. With an unimpressive regular season and quick elimination in the SEC tournament, UK did indeed miss the NCAA tournament for the first time in 18 years and instead received an invitation to the NIT tournament where the team was defeated in the quarterfinal round against Notre Dame.[52][53] On March 27, 2009, an 18-minute-long meeting occurred between Billy Gillispie, President Dr. Lee Todd, Jr. and Athletic Director Mitch Barnhart, after which it was announced that Gillispie would not be returning as the head coach the next season. Barnhart stressed the firing was due to more than wins and losses, citing \"philosophical differences\" and \"a clear gap in how the rules and responsibilities overseeing the program are viewed\".[54] On April 1, 2009, John Calipari replaced former head coach Billy Gillispie as the Wildcats head coach. To begin his tenure at the University of Kentucky, John Calipari signed one of the best all time recruiting classes.[55] The class was headlined by four five-star recruits: John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins, Daniel Orton, and Eric Bledsoe.[56] On December 19, 2009, the Wildcats defeated Austin Peay 90‚Äì69 extending their record to 11‚Äì0, and John Calipari broke Adolph Rupp's record for the most consecutive wins to start a season for a first-year head coach at Kentucky. Kentucky defeated the Drexel Dragons 88‚Äì44 on December 21, 2009, to become the first program in college basketball history to claim their 2000th victory.[57] By January 25, 2010, Coach \"Cal\" had the Kentucky Wildcats ranked No. 1 in both the ESPN/Coaches poll and AP poll with a record of 19‚Äì0.[58] Calipari helped raise in excess of $1.5 million to aid the country of Haiti during the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. President Barack Obama called the Wildcats to thank them for their relief efforts and wish them luck in their future endeavors. To finish off the 2009‚Äì10 regular season, Kentucky won its 44th SEC regular season championship (with a final 14‚Äì2 SEC record), and won its 26th SEC tournament championship, beating Mississippi State in the finals. The Wildcats then received a No. 1 seed (their 10th No. 1 seed in history) in the East Regional of the NCAA tournament, where they eventually lost to West Virginia in the Elite Eight. This also marked Kentucky's record 50th NCAA Tournament appearance. In 2011 the Wildcats got off to a good start in the regular season with a record of 12‚Äì2, with their only losses being North Carolina away and UConn in the Maui Invitational Finals. Conference play was a different matter, and Kentucky would struggle in the SEC losing 6 out of their 8 away games, all of one were against unranked opponents. To close out the season with a three-game defeat No. 13 Florida, No. 23 Vanderbilt and Tennessee at home for a 22‚Äì8 record. The hot streak would continue and Kentucky would win their 27th SEC Tournament Title. This was enough for No. 4 seed on the East regional where they played Princeton in a very close first-round game that ended in a 59‚Äì57 victory for the Cats. Knight, Jones and company would exact their revenge in the second round against West Virginia, who knocked off Kentucky in the 2010 tourney. In the Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight they would upset the No. 1 seed Ohio State Buckeyes and No. 2 seed North Carolina Tar Heels on their way to the school's 14th Final Four. They lost in the Final Four to eventual National Champion No. 3 seed UConn 56‚Äì55. In the 2011‚Äì12 season, Calipari led Kentucky to being 16‚Äì0 in SEC regular season play, clinching its 45th SEC regular season championship. The last team to do so in the SEC was the 2002‚Äì03 Kentucky Wildcats, and before that, the 1995‚Äì96 Kentucky Wildcats. Kentucky's regular season record was 30‚Äì1, with its only loss being by one point coming from a 3-pointer buzzer-beater by the Indiana Hoosiers' Christian Watford at Assembly Hall on December 10, 2011. In the SEC Tournament, Kentucky fell to Vanderbilt in the championship game, making its overall record 32‚Äì2 going into the NCAA tournament. Kentucky was both selected as the No. 1 seed in the South Region and also the No. 1 seed overall of the entire NCAA Tournament. The Sweet 16 match-up on March 23, 2012, was a rematch against Indiana, in which this time the Wildcats prevailed over the Hoosiers 102‚Äì90. On March 25, 2012, Kentucky won the South Regional, setting up a Final Four semifinal with the Louisville Cardinals. Calipari's Wildcats defeated the Cardinals (coached by former Kentucky coach Rick Pitino) by a score of 69‚Äì61. This sent Kentucky to the National Championship game against the Kansas Jayhawks, where they defeated Kansas 67‚Äì59, winning UK's 8th NCAA championship, along with John Calipari's first NCAA Championship as a head coach. This Kentucky team had a record six players drafted in the 2012 NBA draft, including the first time two teammates have been chosen with the first two picks: Anthony Davis (1st overall), Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (2nd), Terrence Jones (18th), Marquis Teague (29th), Doron Lamb (42nd) and Darius Miller (46th). The 2012‚Äì13 season's recruiting class ranked either first or second by various recruiting experts led by top center Nerlens Noel, guard Archie Goodwin, forward Alex Poythress, and four-star center Willie Cauley-Stein. Kentucky also brought in transfer guard Julius Mays, a graduate student who had previously played at Wright State University and North Carolina State. Mays was eligible to play immediately, because UK offered a master's degree program that Wright State did not. However, the only returner that saw significant minutes from the championship squad was back-up power forward Kyle Wiltjer, who averaged 11 minutes per game (Ryan Harrow sat out the previous season after transferring from NC State before the 2011‚Äì12 season). Although the team saw the rise of Jarrod Polson in the first game of the season against Maryland, they struggled to close out closer games and play with the will to win that Calipari demands. On February 12, Noel tore his ACL in a loss against Florida. UK was 17‚Äì7 including that game, and went 4‚Äì5 the remainder of the season, losing all 5 games away from Rupp Arena. The fourth of those losses was against Vanderbilt in the first round of the SEC tournament, and UK missed the NCAA tournament altogether, being the overall No. 1 seed of the NIT. UK was upset by Robert Morris in the first round of the NIT, ending their season with a 21‚Äì12 record. In the press conference following the loss to Robert Morris, Calipari stated that his 2013‚Äì14 team would be a \"tough, hard-nosed, fighting team.\" Noel and Goodwin both entered the NBA draft and were both taken in the first round at 6th and 29th, respectively. Ryan Harrow transferred to Georgia State to be closer to his father that had suffered from a stroke, and Kyle Wiltjer transferred to Gonzaga. Kentucky brought in the No. 1 recruiting class, featuring a record six McDonald's All-Americans in Julius Randle, Andrew Harrison, Aaron Harrison, James Young, Dakari Johnson, and Marcus Lee, as well as Kentucky natives Derek Willis and Dominique Hawkins, and walk-on E. J. Floreal (son of Edrick Flor√©al, head coach of UK's track and field team). Alex Poythress and Willie Cauley-Stein did not declare for the 2013 NBA draft, and decided to return for their sophomore seasons. In 2013‚Äì14, Kentucky looked to make up for its struggles in the previous season. Despite making the NIT, there were high expectations for this team. The team, however, would be without some of its top players from the 2012‚Äì13 team including Nerlens Noel[59] and starting shooting guard Archie Goodwin,[60] who were first-round draft choices in the 2013 NBA draft. Starting power forward Kyle Wiltjer transferred to Gonzaga[61] and starting point guard Ryan Harrow transferred to Georgia State.[62] Returning was former McDonald's All-American Alex Poythress and starting center Willie Cauley-Stein.[60] The poor success of the 2012‚Äì13 team did not stop John Calipari from again producing another number one recruiting class. The entering class included a record six McDonald's All-Americans[63] highlighted by Julius Randle and the Harrison Twins from Texas, Aaron and Andrew. Many recruiting analysts and experts proclaimed that the 2013 signing class was the greatest recruiting class since the infamous Fab Five in the 1990s.[64] The team began the season ranked number one in both the AP and Coaches polls.[65][66] The season was full of ups and downs. Early in the season the team experienced close losses to Baylor, Michigan State, and North Carolina. Despite those losses the team was able to defeat in-state rival Louisville. Nothing changed in SEC play for them either. The team ended the regular season losing three of their last four games including once to South Carolina, who finished the season 14‚Äì20 overall. The team limped into the SEC tournament unranked, and desperately looking for any answer to their disappointing season. Calipari during his weekly radio call-in show mentioned the team was given a \"tweak\".[67] The \"tweak\" sparked speculation and curiosity among the fans and the media to what it could be. The \"tweak\" was never fully revealed. However, the \"tweak\" caused the team to go on an historic run through both the SEC and NCAA tournaments. UK was the runner-up to number one Florida in the SEC Tournament. During the NCAA tournament UK became the first team in history to eliminate three teams from the previous Final Four (Wichita State, Louisville, Michigan). UK was the National Runner-up after losing to Connecticut in the national championship game. After the 2014 season, Kentucky only lost Julius Randle and James Young to the NBA draft.[68][69] The returning players consisted of a record-tying nine McDonald's All-Americans. Juniors Cauley-Stein and Poythress returned with sophomores Aaron and Andrew Harrison, Johnson, and Lee to join the No. 2 ranked 2015 recruiting class which was highlighted of Gatorade Player of the Year Karl-Anthony Towns for the 2015 season.[70] The team began its season in the Bahamas on a six-game tour against international clubs and teams.[71] While in the Bahamas the team established a \"platoon system\" which featured two groups of five players that would rotate every four minutes within the game.[72] The \"platoon system\" was put on display nationally in a 72‚Äì40 victory over No. 5 Kansas in the Champions Classic in November.[73] In December, the team defeated UCLA 83‚Äì44. Kentucky led 41‚Äì7 at halftime, the lowest UCLA point total for a half in its storied history.[74] The SEC regular season began with two overtime victories over Ole Miss and Texas A&M, the closest games Kentucky would play all season. Kentucky finished the regular season with a perfect 31‚Äì0 record, the best start in school history.[75] In the SEC tournament, the team won each game by double digits, including a 78‚Äì63 victory over Arkansas in the finals. Cauley-Stein was named the MVP of the Tournament. In the NCAA tournament Kentucky played its first two games at the KFC Yum! Center in Louisville. Prior to the regional semifinal against West Virginia, Mountaineers guard Daxter Miles proclaimed that Kentucky would be 36‚Äì1 after the game. The comment fueled the team as they defeated West Virginia 78‚Äì39, tying the largest margin of victory in the Sweet 16 in NCAA Tournament history.[76] In the regional final Kentucky narrowly defeated Notre Dame 68‚Äì66. The only loss of the season was in the Final Four to Wisconsin, who Kentucky defeated the previous season in the Final Four. The 2014‚Äì15 team tied the NCAA record for most wins in a season (38).[77] After the season Cauley-Stein and Towns were named consensus All-Americans among other awards received. The Kentucky Wildcats represented USA Basketball, at Globl Jam 2023, and defeated Canada to win the gold medal. Following a first round upset as a 2 seed in the 2024 NCAA Tournament, John Calipari resigned his position of Head Coach to accept the same role at the University of Arkansas. He was officially announced as the Razorbacks Head Coach on April 10, 2024, marking the end of his storied tenure at Kentucky. On April 12, 2024, Kentucky hired BYU head coach Mark Pope for the same position in Lexington,[78] days after Calipari left for the vacant head coaching post at Arkansas.[79] Pope was a member of the Wildcats' 1995-1996 team that won the NCAA Tournament. The Wildcats have had 23 coaches in their 112-year history. Mark Pope is the current head coach. Six Wildcats coaches have won the National Coach-of-the-Year award: Adolph Rupp in 1950, 1954, 1959, 1966, and 1970, Joe B. Hall in 1978, Eddie Sutton in 1986, Rick Pitino in 1990 and 1992, Tubby Smith in 1998, 2003, and 2005, and John Calipari in 2012 and 2015. Additionally, seven Wildcats coaches have been named Southeastern Conference Coach-of-the-Year: Adolph Rupp in 1964, 1966, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971 and 1972, Joe B. Hall in 1973, 1975, 1978 and 1983, Eddie Sutton in 1986, Rick Pitino in 1990, 1991 and 1996, Tubby Smith in 1998, 2003, and 2005, Billy Gillispie in 2008, and John Calipari in 2010, 2012, and 2015.[80] The following is a list of Kentucky's 8 National Championships: The NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition. The * represents overall number one seed which began with the 2004 Tournament. Kentucky has 42 men's basketball players, coaches, and contributors honored in Rupp Arena with banners representing their numbers hung from the rafters. Due to the number of players honored, the fact that several of them have shared numbers, the numbers are not officially retired. Some of the jersey numbers were before the NCAA rule change before the 1957‚Äì58 season that outlawed teams wearing jerseys with a number higher than 5 on it that was not changed until 2023.[81] To have a banner hung, the individual must be elected to the UK Athletics Hall of Fame.[82] The following Kentucky players, coaches, and contributors have been enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. The following Kentucky players and coaches have represented their country in basketball in the Summer Olympic Games: The Kentucky Wildcats presently play their home games in 20,545-seat Rupp Arena. When it opened in 1976, it was the largest arena in the United States built specifically for basketball, and retained that status for much of the following 40-plus years. It was opened in 1976 and is named after legendary Kentucky head coach Adolph Rupp. Located off-campus, in downtown Lexington, the facility's official capacity was 23,500+[89] until a renovation project in the 2019 offseason reduced the capacity to 20,545.[90] The Wildcats have consistently led the country in home attendance since the 1976‚Äì77 season (when Rupp Arena first opened), winning the National Attendance Title a record 25 times, including 17 of the past 20 seasons, and 8 of the last 10 seasons. Kentucky also has an impressive 529‚Äì64 (.892) all-time record in Rupp Arena.[91] In 2007, the university unveiled the Joe Craft Center, a state-of-the-art basketball practice facility and athletics office building attached to the north side of Memorial Coliseum on the \"Avenue of Champions\" at the University of Kentucky campus in Lexington, Kentucky.[91] The 102,000 ft2 structure contains separate practice courts for the men's and women's basketball programs, separate men's and women's locker rooms, state-of-the-art video rooms for game film viewing, new coaches offices, a ticket office, and athletic administration offices.[92] As a result, Memorial Coliseum has more ample space for volleyball and gymnastics practice and games. The facility is named after businessman and philanthropist Joe Craft, a Hazard, Kentucky native, who pledged $6 million towards the completion of the $30 million project.[92][93] Coming off back-to-back national championships, the team moved to Memorial Coliseum in 1950. Nicknamed \"The House That Rupp Built\", the multipurpose facility cost $4 million and seated 12,000 people. It also housed a swimming pool, physical education equipment, and offices for the athletics staff. The team occupied Memorial Coliseum for twenty-six seasons, and sold out all 345 home games they played there during that period. Kentucky also played a 2009 NIT game at Memorial Coliseum due to Rupp Arena being booked. The Wildcats are 307‚Äì38 (.890) all-time at Memorial Coliseum.[89][91][94] Today, Memorial Coliseum is home to three UK women's teams‚Äîbasketball, gymnastics, and volleyball. In 1924, Alumni Gymnasium was completed. It included seating for 2,800 people and cost $92,000 to construct.[95] Kentucky played 271 games at Alumni Gymnasium from 1924 to 1950, going 247‚Äì24 (.911).[91][96] After a major renovation completed in 2018, it is now a student recreation facility known as Alumni Gym Fitness Center.[97] Woodland Park Auditorium, opened in 1906 and closed in 1941, was located on the corner of East High Street and Kentucky Avenue in Lexington, Kentucky. Kentucky used this facility for home games during World War I between 1914 and 1916 going 15‚Äì7 there all-time.[91][98] The Wildcats played 84 home games at Buell Armory Gymnasium from 1910 to 1924. It was named for Union Civil War General Don Carlos Buell who was a member of the first board of trustees at Kentucky.[99] The armory was also used during World War I to teach truck maintenance and repair among other skills.[100] Kentucky was 59‚Äì25 all-time at Buell Armory Gymnasium.[101] The first home court for the Wildcats was simply called \"The Gymnasium\" or State College Gymnasium until 1910. It was located in the north wing of Barker Hall on the university campus. Constructed in 1902, it also housed the university's physical education classes until 1909. The facility had a capacity of 650 people, and with no bleachers or seats, fans had to stand to watch the games that were played there.[95] By the 1920s, it had become clear that \"The Gymnasium\" (by then renamed \"The Ladies' Gym\") was inadequate to house the university's basketball team. Records show Kentucky was 17‚Äì14 at State College Gymnasium.[91][100][102] (Of the 71 major categories listed above, Kentucky is No. 1 in 50 of them, No. 2 in 16 of them, No. No. 3 in 3 of them, No. 4 in 1 of them, and No. 8 in 1 of them.) Kentucky can also lay claim to several individual achievements for both players and coaches: Kentucky also holds several other NCAA records and various additional accomplishments:",

                "content": "The Kentucky Wildcats are the men's and women's intercollegiate athletic squads of the University of Kentucky (UK), a founding member of the Southeastern Conference. The Kentucky Wildcats is the student body of the University of Kentucky. 30,473 students attend the university. Historically, the women's teams and athletes were referred to as the \"Lady Kats\", but all athletic squads adopted the \"Wildcats\" nickname in 1995. Collectively, the fans of the Kentucky Wildcats are often referred to as the Big Blue Nation. Their main and most intense rival is the University of Louisville. The Wildcats are composed of 25 varsity teams that compete nationally‚Äî23 in NCAA-recognized sports, plus the cheerleading squad and dance team. The nickname \"Wildcats\" became synonymous with UK shortly after a 6‚Äì2 football road victory over Illinois on October 9, 1909. Commandant Philip W. Corbusier, then head of the military department at old State University, told a group of students in a chapel service following the game that the Kentucky football team had \"fought like Wildcats.\" Later the name Wildcats became more and more popular among UK followers as well as with members of the media. As a result, the nickname was adopted by the university.[2] The university adopted blue and white as its official colors in 1892. Originally, however, UK students had decided on blue and light yellow prior to the Kentucky-Centre College football game on December 19, 1887. The shade of blue, which is close to a royal blue, was chosen when a student asked the question, \"What color blue?\" At the time, Richard C. Stoll (who lettered in football at UK in 1889‚Äì94) pulled off his necktie and held it up. The students then adopted that particular shade of blue. A year later, UK students officially dropped the light yellow color for white because the two colors did not look good together.[2] UK has won 13 national championships including the 2012 men's basketball title. UK also boasts the 1988 women's cross country national championship; 2020‚Äì21 women's volleyball championship; 2011, 2018, and 2021 rifle championships, and 8 men's basketball titles. UK was also crowned an NCAA co-champion, after knocking off #1 Oklahoma in the 1951 Sugar Bowl to win the 1950 National Championship in college football. Beginning in the 1890s, students at the University of Kentucky started scheduling football games with neighboring colleges.[3] The basketball program began on campus in 1902, originally as a women's sport;[3] a men's team was added one year later. Several decades later, in 1930, then-high school coach Adolph Rupp was hired as a basketball coach for the university, a career that would span over 40 years until 1972.[4] During his tenure, he led the Kentucky Wildcats to four NCAA crowns in 1948, 1949, 1951 and 1958.[3] The Wildcats later won a fifth championship under Joe B. Hall in 1978, another in 1996 under Rick Pitino, in 1998 under Orlando \"Tubby\" Smith, and its most recent in 2012 under Coach John Calipari.[3] Calipari has been the coach since the 2009‚Äì10 season. In 2007, the university unveiled the Joe Craft Center, a $30 million state-of-the-art basketball practice facility for both the men's and women's teams, named after businessman and philanthropist Kentuckian Joe Craft. Considered to be an elite NCAA basketball program, the University of Kentucky men's basketball team is the winningest program in the history of college basketball. The team was the first ever Division I squad to reach 2,000 victories after defeating Drexel University on December 21, 2009.[citation needed] Kentucky also leads all NCAA schools in all-time winning percentage (.762) with an all-time record of 2111‚Äì661. The men's team has earned a total of eight NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championships, second only to UCLA's eleven championships. UK's eight championships were won by five different coaches ‚Äì Adolph Rupp in 1948, 1949, 1951 and 1958, Joe B. Hall in 1978, Rick Pitino in 1996, Tubby Smith in 1998, and John Calipari in 2012. Kentucky's 1933 and 1954 teams were also awarded the Helms national championship, and his 1934, 1947, and 1948 teams were retroactively recognized as the national champion by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.[5][6] The Wildcats also won two NIT Championships in 1946 and 1976. The program has garnered 45 SEC regular season titles. Since the 2009‚Äì10 season, John Calipari has coached the Wildcats with a \"one-and-done\" approach to recruiting, resulting in freshman-laden lineups ‚Äì including a record 5 first round draft picks in the 2010 NBA draft and 6 Wildcats taken in the 2012 NBA draft. The first University of Kentucky women's basketball team was organized in 1902, competing for the first time on February 21, 1903. However, in 1924, the University Senate passed a bill to abolish women's basketball in part because \"basketball had proven to be a strenuous sport for boys and therefore was too strenuous for girls.\" After a 50-year absence, women's basketball finally reached varsity status in 1974. The team was given the nickname \"Lady Kats\" and was coached by Debbie Yow.[7] Led by UK all-time leading scorer Valerie Still, Patty Jo Hedges, and Lea Wise, the Lady Kats won the SEC Tournament in 1982. The following year, the same trio led the team to a #4 ranking in the country, the highest in the team's history. The team was previously coached by Matthew Mitchell, named as the SEC Coach of the Year in 2010 after leading the 2009‚Äì10 team to a surprising 28‚Äì8 season in which they set school records for best start, most consecutive SEC wins, best SEC finish, and most wins in a season, culminating in their first NCAA regional final since 1982. The team also had the conference Player of the Year in Victoria Dunlap and Freshman of the Year in A'dia Mathies. The team is now coached by Kyra Elzy, who took the position in December 2020. The Wildcats would upset top-ranked South Carolina in the 2022 SEC Women's Basketball Tournament finals.[8] Kentucky plays at Kroger Field (formerly Commonwealth Stadium from 1973 to 2017), which replaced Stoll Field in 1973. Paul \"Bear\" Bryant was Kentucky's head football coach for eight seasons. Under Bryant the Wildcats won the 1947 Great Lakes Bowl, lost the 1950 Orange Bowl, won the 1951 Sugar Bowl and the 1952 Cotton Bowl Classic. In final AP polls, the Wildcats were ranked #11 in 1949, #7 in 1950, #15 in 1951, #20 in 1952 and #16 in 1953. At the time of the 1951 Sugar Bowl win over #1 Oklahoma, the final polls were taken before the bowl games. The NCAA has never officially recognized a national champion from among the bowl coalition institutions, but in 2004 the NCAA commissioned Jeff Sagarin to use his computer model to retroactively determine the highest ranked teams for the years prior to the BCS. His champion for the 1950 season is Kentucky. The 1976 Wildcats retroactively claimed a share of the Southeastern Conference championship under coach Fran Curci via a loss later forfeited by Mississippi State (and despite losing at home to conference champion Georgia) and won the Peach Bowl, finishing #18 in the final AP poll. The 1977 Kentucky team went 10‚Äì1 and was undefeated in SEC play but, despite finishing the season ranked #6 in the AP poll, did not play in a bowl game due to NCAA sanctions. Kentucky finished at #6 and Penn State at #5 despite the fact that Kentucky defeated Penn State at Penn State during the regular season. Coach Jerry Claiborne led the Wildcats to the 1983 Hall of Fame Bowl. In 1984 Kentucky returned to the Hall of Fame Bowl and defeated a ranked Wisconsin team to finish the season with a 9‚Äì3 record and a #19 ranking in the final AP poll. The Wildcats played in the 1993 Peach Bowl under coach Bill Curry. Coach Hal Mumme led the Wildcats to the 1998 Outback Bowl and the 1999 Music City Bowl but the program was hit with severe sanctions for infractions during Mumme's tenure. Under coach Guy Morriss the Wildcats posted a 7‚Äì5 record in 2002 but were not eligible for postseason play due to NCAA sanctions. Coach Rich Brooks led the team to an 8‚Äì5 regular season record in 2006, including a memorable upset over the defending SEC champion Georgia, snapping a nine-game losing streak to the Bulldogs. Brooks also led the football team to its first bowl game since 1999 and its first bowl game victory since 1984, as Kentucky defeated the Clemson University Tigers 28‚Äì20 in the 2006 Music City Bowl.[9] On September 15, 2007. Brooks led UK to a 40‚Äì34 win over number 9 ranked Louisville. This marked UK's first win over a top 10 team since #4 Penn State in 1977. The Wildcats were ranked 8th in the nation before a loss to South Carolina on October 4. After the loss to South Carolina, Kentucky bounced back on October 13 to defeat #1 LSU in an historic triple overtime game. The 2007 Kentucky Wildcats football defeated the Florida State Seminoles 35‚Äì28 in the 2007 Music City Bowl in Nashville, Tennessee, on December 31, 2007. It was the Wildcats second straight bowl appearance. Quarterback Andre' Woodson was named the Music City Bowl MVP for the second year in a row. The last three bowl appearances for the Cats have been in the Music City Bowl, which they have appeared in more than any other SEC team in the conference's affiliation with the game, which dates back to the inaugural game in 1998. On January 2, 2009, Kentucky football set a record with the school's first back to back to back bowl games. After a bad start in the Liberty Bowl, Kentucky made a comeback from a 16‚Äì3 deficit at halftime to beat East Carolina 25‚Äì19. After a fumble by the East Carolina running back, UK Defensive Tackle Ventrell Jenkins returned the ball over 50 yards for the score that gave Kentucky their first lead of the game. Former Wildcat wide receiver and longtime assistant coach Joker Phillips was formally named head coach January 6, 2010 after Brooks' retirement.[10] Phillips took Kentucky to the BBVA Compass Bowl in Birmingham, Alabama in his first season as a head coach, losing to Big East Conference co-champion Pittsburgh 27‚Äì10. However, the Wildcats would not return to a bowl in either of the next two seasons. The main highlight of those years came in 2011, when Kentucky defeated Tennessee for the first time since 1984. Phillips was fired in November 2012, effective at season's end. Phillips was replaced by Florida State defensive coordinator Mark Stoops, younger brother of Oklahoma head coach Bob Stoops. Stoops has gone on to become the winningest coach in Kentucky's history. In 2018, Stoops and Kentucky had arguably the best season in program history going 10‚Äì3 and beating Penn State 27‚Äì24 in the 2019 Citrus Bowl which was led by 2019 7th overall pick Josh Hines-Allen and all-time leading rusher Benny Snell. Stoops also led Kentucky to win the Belk Bowl along with the Gator Bowl. After a historic 6‚Äì0 start in 2021, the Wildcats lost three games in a row to fall out of contention for the conference title. The Wildcats baseball team began play in their new stadium, Kentucky Proud Park, in fall 2018, replacing Cliff Hagan Stadium, where they had played since 1969. The baseball program, partly hampered by being the northernmost school in the heavily warm-weather SEC[citation needed], has historically achieved only modest success at best. Wildcats baseball hit bottom at the turn of the 21st century, with only one winning season from 1997 through 2004, and last-place finishes in the SEC East division in every season from 2001 through 2005. In 2003, after the retirement of longtime coach Keith Madison, Kentucky hired Florida assistant John Cohen as head coach. Cohen was able to lead the Cats to a winning overall season in 2005, despite another SEC cellar finish. In 2008, Cohen left Kentucky to accept the coaching position at Mississippi State University. He was replaced by former Kentucky assistant Gary Henderson. Few could have expected the Cinderella season the Cats would have in 2006. They literally went from worst to first in the SEC, winning a regular-season conference title for the first time in three decades, and being ranked as high as fourth in the country by one major baseball poll during the season[citation needed]. However, the newly energized Kentucky baseball faithful saw the Cats crash out of the SEC tournament early and fail to make it out of the regionals of the NCAA tournament at home. In 2012, Kentucky garnered its most successful season ever in program history. Henderson was voted SEC Coach of the Year by the league coaches. Henderson directed the Wildcats to a school-record 45-win season, with UK completing its best finishes in the SEC and NCAA tournaments in school annals. The 2012 season also marked the first time that UK had ever been ranked No. 1. UK finished the season with a No. 11 ranking by Baseball America. UK also achieved a program record by winning seven of ten series in SEC play. UK also ran up a school-record 22-game winning streak, which is the second longest in SEC history. In 2014, Kentucky produced its first ever College Baseball National Player of the Year in A. J. Reed. During the regular season Reed was 11‚Äì2 with a 2.10 earned-run average on the mound and at the plate led the nation in home runs (23)‚Äîmore than 193 entire Division I teams[citation needed] ‚Äî slugging percentage (.768) and OPS (1.259). Reed also won SEC Player of the Year honors. The Wildcats made it to the Semifinals of the SEC Tournament and played in the Louisville regional of the 2014 NCAA tournament. In 2017, Henderson had resigned and was replaced by Nick Mingione, who had been an assistant in the 2006 season. Mingione brought a new attitude to the team and they had a 43‚Äì23 record with 19‚Äì11 in the SEC. They went on to host an NCAA regional NCAA Regional.[11] The Cats won the Regional and advanced on the Super Regional and were defeated by Louisville. Minione was named SEC coach of the year.[12] The University of Kentucky softball team had their inaugural season in 1997.[13] University of Kentucky Athletic Director Mitch Barnhart hired Rachel Lawson in July 2007. Since Lawson's hire she has become the winningest coach in program history. She has also guided UK to six NCAA Super Regionals since 2011 including an appearance in the 2014 College World Series, the program's first. Now sitting at 361‚Äì232 in her eleven seasons at Kentucky, Lawson is the winningest head coach in school history and already has more wins in SEC play than UK had total as a program when she took over in 2007. UK also finished 2016 in the top 14 of both collegiate softball rankings for the third time in school history with eleven wins over ranked teams. Another accomplishment since Lawson's hire in 2007 is the integration of John Cropp Stadium. The facility cost $9.5 million, and debuted for the 2013 season. UK hosted the 2013 SEC Tournament as well as an NCAA regional, another first for the program. Since 2013, UK has hosted an NCAA regional in 2014 and 2016‚Äì2018. Edrick Flor√©al was hired a UK Track and Field coach in 2012,[14] and has led the Wildcats to 6 NCAA individual championships and 29 individual SEC championships. Notable track athletes: The University of Kentucky cheerleaders have won the UCA (Division I-A) Cheerleading Championship 24 times, more than any other school. They are the only school to win more than two consecutive championships, having won each year from 1995 through 2002 and from 2004 through 2006, and are the only school to win consecutive championships on multiple occasions, having done so four times (1987‚Äì1988, 1995‚Äì2002, 2004‚Äì2006, and 2008‚Äì2010). They have won championships in 1985, 1987, 1988, 1992, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019; have also placed second four times, and have finished in the top ten every year since the existence of the UCA National College Championships.[15] The squad has been featured on the \"CBS Evening News\", Connie Chung's \"Eye to Eye\", and the \"CBS Morning Show\", NBC's The Today Show, in \"Southern Living\" and Gentlemen's Quarterly, \"ESPN the Magazine\", and \"Seventeen\" magazines. A reality show on WE: Women's Entertainment called \"Cheerleader U.\" followed the team during the 2006‚Äì07 season. Although cheerleading as a whole has no NCAA recognition, UK considers it to be a varsity sport. In recent years, UK added a team in stunt (often stylized as STUNT), an emerging all-female cheerleading discipline that emphasizes the sport's acrobatic and technical aspects. The stunt program was initially sponsored at club level until being elevated to varsity status in 2022‚Äì23, a year before stunt became part of the NCAA Emerging Sports for Women program.[16] The men's and women's golf teams call the University Club of Kentucky their home course. Notable alumni of the golf team include 1967 Masters tournament winner Gay Brewer, current PGA Tour golfers J. B. Holmes and Steve Flesch, current Champions Tour golfer Russ Cochran, and former Kentucky governor John Y. Brown Jr. The University of Kentucky Men's Tennis Team is coached by longtime assistant coach and former All-American Cedric Kauffmann. They play their home matches at the Boone Tennis Center since January 1986. They have won the SEC Regular season title twice (1992,2012) and the SEC tournament once (1992) Notable Kentucky tennis athletes: The co-ed Rifle team is coached by Harry Mullins. It began as a club sport in 1982. UK is a member of the single-sport Great America Rifle Conference. UK won the team national championship in 2011, as well as the title in smallbore. Individual National Champions include: Nancy Napolski ‚Äì 1994 Air Rifle, Ethan Settlemires ‚Äì 2011 Smallbore, Connor Davis ‚Äì 2014 Air Rifle, Henrik Larsen ‚Äì 2018 Air Rifle, and Mary Tucker - 2021 Smallbore and 2021 Air Rifle. Kentucky has won 14 NCAA team national championships.[18] The following national team titles were not bestowed by the NCAA: UK has a men's hockey team that competes at club level, which means that it is student-operated without university assistance, and they compete in the American Collegiate Hockey Association's Division II level. The University of Kentucky Hockey Team (founded 1984) competes in the American Collegiate Hockey Association. The \"Coolcats\" play their home games at the Lexington Ice Center. In 1998 the cats released their first poster featuring actress and UK alum Ashley Judd. Since the debut of the first poster, the cats have issued an annual poster featuring a celebrity with ties to the bluegrass. The program has achieved success including 3 national tournament appearances, 1992 national runner-up, and 18 winning seasons. Recently, the Cool Cats simply became the Wildcats. The Wildcats have enjoyed a regional bid in the 06‚Äì07 season. In the 2007‚Äì08 season the cats finished in the national tournament failing to make it out of pool play. All home games are played at the Lexington Ice Center at midnight. The University of Kentucky Rugby Club was founded in 1970.[19] The club was organized by an engineering professor Dr. Roy Elmore and two of his students Larry Sonnifield and Rick Wunderlich. The team began competing in the fall of 1971 and quickly become a power in the newly formed SEC Conference. Kentucky won 3 conference titles in their initial Southeastern run in 1979, 1986, and 1987. Despite this success, the program spent much of the 90s and 00s flipping between the Indiana Rugby Union and Ohio Rugby Union Division 3 competitions. In 2011, Kentucky joined the Southeastern Collegiate Rugby Conference. Since then, they have won an additional 3 conference championships in 15s in 2017, 2018, and 2023.[20] In 2019 the Wildcats also won the SCRC Olympic (7s) championship.[21] In 2010 Gary Anderson became an assistant to then Head Coach Tony Vince and began to recruit high school players from Ohio and Indiana. This practice led to the rapid improvement of the program and in 2016 Anderson was named head coach. During his tenure, the club won 3 SCRC championships, 2 in 15s and 1 in 7s. Following their 2017 conference championship, the Wildcats advanced to the USA Rugby D1-AA National Semifinal, falling to eventual champions Mary Washington. In 2018, the Wildcats again won the SCRC and advanced to the national D1-AA tournament, again losing to the eventual national champions, Bowling Green, in the quarterfinal. In 2022, Anderson stepped down as head coach and moved to an administrative role. To replace him, the club hired Samuel Enari to a 3-year contract. This was the first time the club had hired a fully professional head coach. Enari's tenure with UK has been massively successful. In 2022 the Wildcats were undefeated in conference play but did not advance to the conference final. The SCRC had joined the NCR D1-AA competition, but UK had stayed with USA Rugby, thus they were ineligible for postseason play within the conference. Instead, the Wildcats accepted a bid to play in the Mint City Bowl against Colorado State, which they won 32‚Äì15.[22] In 2023, the Wildcats joined NCR and went undefeated in conference play once again. Now able to compete for the conference title, the Wildcats downed Alabama in the SCRC semifinal 27‚Äì10. In the SCRC Championship, they faced Tennessee and won 32‚Äì12. Notably, 2023 featured a first ever SCRC B-Side championship, which Kentucky also won.[23] In the NCR D1-AA Quarterfinal, Kentucky hosted Southern Conference champions North Carolina State and won 32‚Äì12. In the NCR D1-AA Semifinal held in Reading, Pennsylvania, Kentucky beat Boston College 51‚Äì12.[24] One week later, Kentucky met in-state rivals Louisville in Houston at Sabercats Stadium and defeated the Cardinals decisively, 43‚Äì26, at one point leading 40‚Äì0 before a pair of yellow cards allowed Louisville to come back into the game.[25] The program currently plays college rugby in NCR Division 1-AA in the Southeastern Collegiate Rugby Conference. This conference is made up of several of the traditional SEC teams, and is divided into East and West. The program has a fully professional head coach Samuel Enari, and six volunteer coaches, five of which are alumni. The program also offers a limited amount of scholarship funding to rugby players.[26] The program funds itself with the support of an alumni base that puts together events throughout the year. This includes a charity golf tournament held in the fall in honor of alumnus Rob Shelton and is capped off each spring with an Alumni Game where the old boys play against the present UK squad. The University of Kentucky has three official mascots: The true name of the university's costumed mascot has often been disputed ‚Äì even amongst sports industry executives. Some argue for \"Wildcat\", while others vehemently contend it's \"Scratch\". In the absence of a definitive position by the university, fans, pundits and executives alike are left to decide for themselves.

Blanco was initially mentored by songwriter and producer Dr. Luke, who signed Blanco to his production company Kasz Money Productions. Under his tutelage, Blanco co-produced and co-wrote a multitude of hit singles in the late 2000s and thereafter. Blanco's work has led to sales of over 500 million album-equivalent units worldwide for artists including Ed Sheeran, BTS, Eminem, Justin Bieber, Halsey, Katy Perry, Maroon 5, Christina Aguilera, Kesha, Britney Spears, Rihanna, Sia, The Weeknd, Kanye West, Avicii, Selena Gomez, Adam Lambert, Charlie Puth, Keith Urban, OneRepublic, Wiz Khalifa, J Balvin, Ariana Grande, Kali Uchis, Juice Wrld, and SZA.

His debut studio album, Friends Keep Secrets was released in December of that year to modest success.[5] A deluxe issue of the album was released in March 2021, a date which coincided with the original receiving platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[6] Blanco has founded two labels as imprints of Interscope Records‚ÄîMad Love Records and Friends Keep Secrets‚Äîin 2014, through both of which he has signed artists including Tory Lanez, Jessie Ware, and Cashmere Cat, among others.[7] After Friends Keep Secrets and Mad Love were dissolved in 2024, Blanco owns an imprint of Interscope, A&M Records (founded by Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss in 1962). Benjamin Joseph Levin in Reston, Virginia[8] and has an older brother.[9] He is Jewish.[9][10] He began producing hip-hop instrumentals in his bedroom and recording his own vocals on top of them. His first serious exposure to music came in 1994, when he was six years old with Nas's \"The World Is Yours\" and All-4-One's \"I Swear\" on cassette tapes, which influenced his early productions.[11][12] After early experiments with beat making and recording himself on his boombox, Blanco's rapping earned the attention of The Source and executives at Columbia Records. He attended Camp Airy for many years of his childhood in Thurmont, Maryland, where he would routinely perform and host a radio show under the name \"Ebba Ebba\". Blanco eventually secured an apprenticeship with producer Disco D after multiple trips to New York City from his home in Virginia to meet with labels and producers.[12] Blanco was mentored for several years by songwriter and producer Dr. Luke, who signed Blanco to his production company Kasz Money Productions.[13] While under Dr. Luke's tutelage, Blanco co-produced and co-wrote many songs, including hits such as Katy Perry's \"Teenage Dream\", Kesha's \"TiK ToK\", and Taio Cruz's \"Dynamite\". In 2008, he took part in writing and producing Britney Spears' \"Circus\" (with Dr. Luke, and Claude Kelly). The song reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on American pop radio and is her second-best-selling digital song in the United States, having sold over 3.2 million downloads as of July 2016.[14] On a global scale, \"Circus\" was one of the top 10 best-selling songs of 2009 with 5.5 million digital copies sold that year across the world, according to the IFPI.[15] In 2011, Blanco wrote and produced his first charting hits without Dr. Luke, among them Maroon 5's \"Moves Like Jagger\", Gym Class Heroes' \"Stereo Hearts\" and 3OH!3's \"Don't Trust Me\".

Blanco was named Producer of the Year at the 2017 iHeartRadio Music Awards.[19] In 2007, Blanco teamed up with Baltimore rappers Spank Rock to release Spank Rock and Benny Blanco Are...Bangers & Cash, a collaborative EP for both artists based on 2 Live Crew samples that caught the attention of many in the industry and sparked connections to future collaborators Amanda Blank and Santigold. The EP received acclaim from the likes of Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and more. In July 2018, Blanco released his debut song as a standalone solo artist, \"Eastside\" featuring Halsey and Khalid, on his own label Friends Keep Secrets with Interscope Records.

The first episode featured a behind-the-scenes visit to fellow YouTuber Kenny Beats's show The Cave where Blanco teaches Matheson to rap. Additional episodes included Lil Dicky, Mason Ramsey, Diplo, Laird Hamilton and more.[32] On April 16, 2020, Blanco made his TV debut playing a fictionalized version of himself on the first and second seasons of the FXX series Dave with Lil Dicky.[33] On March 31, 2021, Blanco and chef Matty Matheson debuted a new cooking show on Blanco's YouTube channel, called Stupid F*cking Cooking Show. Blanco's first book, Open Wide: A Cookbook for Friends,[34] was published on April 30, 2024, by Dey Street Books/HarperCollins.[35] Co-authored with Jess Damuck, Open Wide debuted on best seller lists from The New York Times, Los Angeles Times and USA Today,[36] sitting on The New York Times list for two weeks at publication.

In 2014, Blanco founded two imprint labels under Interscope, Mad Love Records and Friends Keep Secrets.[37] The former label includes the following artists, many of whom were initially signed with the former, which served as its predecessor.[38][39] As of 2024, they were both defunct, Interscope relaunched a new A&M Records label, operated by Blanco.

                "title": "Bill Belichick - Wikipedia",
                "content": "William Stephen Belichick (/Ààb…õl…™t É…™k, Ààb…õl…™t É…õk/; born April 16, 1952) is an American football coach who is the head football coach at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Widely regarded as one of the greatest head coaches of all time,[1][2][3] he holds numerous coaching records, including the record of most Super Bowl wins (six) as a head coach, all with the New England Patriots, along with two more during his time as the defensive coordinator of the New York Giants, for a record eight combined total Super Bowl victories as coach and coordinator.[4] A renowned American football historian, Belichick is often referred to as a \"student of the game\" with a deep knowledge of the intricacies of each player position.[5][6][7][8] During his tenure with the Patriots, Belichick was a central figure as the head coach and de facto general manager during the franchise's dynasty from 2001 to 2019.[9] Belichick is a descendant of the Bill Parcells coaching tree. He began his coaching career in 1975 as an assistant for the Baltimore Colts and became the defensive coordinator for New York Giants head coach Bill Parcells by 1985. Parcells and Belichick won two Super Bowls together before Belichick left to become the head coach of the Cleveland Browns in 1991. He remained in Cleveland for five seasons but was fired following the team's 1995 season. Belichick rejoined Parcells, first in New England where the team lost Super Bowl XXXI, and later with the New York Jets. After being named head coach of the Jets, Belichick resigned after only one day on the job to accept the head coaching job for the Patriots on January 27, 2000. In 24 seasons under Belichick, the Patriots won 17 AFC East division titles, made 13 appearances in the AFC Championship Game, and appeared in nine Super Bowls, with a record six wins. Overall, Belichick has won eight Super Bowl titles (the most of any individual in NFL history) and finished as runner-up four times from his combined time as an assistant and head coach. At the time Belichick left the Patriots, he was the NFL's longest-tenured active head coach. Belichick has the most playoff coaching wins all-time with 31 and ranks third in regular season coaching wins in the NFL with 302.[10] He is also in second place for combined regular season and postseason wins, and also second place for most regular season coaching wins with one franchise.[11] Belichick is one of only three head coaches who have won six NFL titles.[12] He was named the AP NFL Coach of the Year for the 2003, 2007, and 2010 seasons. Belichick has also been selected to the NFL 2000s All-Decade Team, NFL 2010s All-Decade Team, as well as the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team. Belichick was born in Nashville, Tennessee, on April 16, 1952,[13] the son of Jeannette (n√©e Munn) and Steve Belichick.[14] Belichick was named after College Football Hall of Fame coach Bill Edwards, who was his godfather.[15] He is of Croatian ancestry;[16] his paternal grandparents, Marija Barkoviƒá and Ivan Biliƒçiƒá, emigrated from Draganiƒá in 1897 and settled in Monessen, Pennsylvania, having changed their names to Mary and John Belichick at the suggestion of immigration officers.[17] Belichick was raised in Annapolis, Maryland,[18] where his father was an assistant football coach at the United States Naval Academy. Belichick has said his father is one of his most important football mentors, and Belichick often studied football with him.[19] Bill reportedly learned to break down game films at a young age by watching his father and the Navy staff do their jobs.[20] Belichick graduated from Annapolis High School in 1970, where he was a classmate of Sally Brice-O'Hara, who would later become the Vice Commandant of the Coast Guard.[21][22] While there, Belichick played football and lacrosse, with the latter being his favorite sport.[23] Belichick enrolled at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, for a postgraduate year, with the intention of improving his grades and test scores to be admitted into a quality college.[24] The school honored Belichick 40 years later by inducting him into its Athletics Hall of Honor in 2011.[25] Belichick attended Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, where he played center and tight end. In addition to being a member of the football team, Belichick played lacrosse and squash, serving as the captain of the lacrosse team during his senior season. A member of Chi Psi fraternity,[26] Belichick earned a bachelor's degree in economics in 1975.[27] Eventually, he was part of the inaugural induction class into the university's Athletics Hall of Fame in spring 2008.[28] After graduating, Belichick took a $25-per-week job as an assistant to Baltimore Colts head coach Ted Marchibroda in 1975.[29] In 1976, Belichick joined the Detroit Lions as their assistant special teams coach before adding tight ends and wide receivers to his coaching duties in 1977.[30] Belichick was dismissed along with head coach Tommy Hudspeth and the rest of the coaching staff on January 9, 1978.[31] He spent the 1978 season with the Denver Broncos as their assistant special teams coach and defensive assistant while also serving as director of films.[32][33] In 1979, Belichick began a 12-year stint with the New York Giants alongside head coach Ray Perkins as a defensive assistant and special teams coach.[34] Belichick added linebackers coaching to his duties in 1980 and was named defensive coordinator in 1985 under head coach Bill Parcells, who had replaced Perkins in 1983. The Giants won Super Bowl XXI and Super Bowl XXV following the 1986 and 1990 seasons.[35][36] Belichick's defensive game plan from the New York Giants' 20‚Äì19 upset of the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXV has been placed in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[37] From 1991 until 1995, Belichick was the head coach of the Cleveland Browns. During his tenure in Cleveland, Belichick compiled a 36‚Äì44 record, leading the team to the playoffs in 1994, his only winning year with the team.[38] Coincidentally, Belichick's lone playoff victory during his Browns tenure was achieved against the New England Patriots, who were coached by former Giants head coach Bill Parcells, in the Wild Card Round during that postseason.[39] In Belichick's final season in Cleveland, the Browns finished 5‚Äì11 despite starting 3‚Äì1.[40] One of his most controversial moves was cutting quarterback Bernie Kosar midway through the 1993 season. Kosar was signed by the Dallas Cowboys two days later and won a Super Bowl with the Cowboys in Super Bowl XXVIII as a backup. In November 1995, in the middle of the ongoing football season, Browns owner Art Modell had announced he would move his franchise to Baltimore after the season.[41] After first being given assurances that he would coach the new team that would later become the Baltimore Ravens, Belichick was instead fired on February 14, 1996, a week after the shift was officially announced.[42] In the 2013 episode of A Football Life on the Cleveland Browns relocation controversy, many sports journalists who had covered the Browns at the time had said that in retrospective, Belichick had laid the groundwork for the Ravens success in the ensuring decades including their win in Super Bowl XXXV (with Cleveland holdovers Matt Stover and Rob Burnett still with the team at that point), setting up the infrastructure by giving recently retired tight end Ozzie Newsome his first front-office job and had planned on drafting Ray Lewis in the 1996 NFL Draft if Belichick and the team stayed in Cleveland. (Indeed, the newly-christened Ravens did draft Lewis, who went on to a 17-year Hall of Fame career with the team.) Those who had covered the Browns went on to state that if the original Browns had stayed in Cleveland, Belichick would have seen his work through. For his part, Belichick stated that he was able to learn from some mistakes he had made with the Browns while largely sticking to his blueprint from Cleveland when resurrecting the Patriots, such as factoring in off-the-field issues that can affect performance. Among those interviewed, the general consensus was that Belichick's failure in Cleveland was more to do with Modell's financial struggles (even paying a young Scott Pioli only $14,000/year--equivalent to $32,447 in 2024--as a scout) that eventually led the NFL to force the sale of the Ravens to Steve Bisciotti than Belichick's own doing.[43] After his dismissal by the Cleveland Browns, Belichick served under Parcells again as assistant head coach and defensive backs coach with the New England Patriots for the 1996 season. The Patriots finished with an 11‚Äì5 record and won the AFC Championship over the Jacksonville Jaguars, but they lost to the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XXXI amid rumors of Parcells's impending defection.[44][45] Belichick had two stints as the head coach of the New York Jets without ever coaching a game. In February 1997, Belichick, who had been an assistant coach under Bill Parcells with the New York Giants and New England Patriots, was named the Jets interim head coach while the Jets and Patriots continued to negotiate compensation to release Parcells from his contract with the Patriots and allow Parcells to coach the Jets.[46] Six days later, the Patriots and Jets reached an agreement that allowed Parcells to coach the Jets, and Belichick became the team's assistant head coach and defensive coordinator.[47] When Parcells stepped down as head coach after the 1999 season, he had already arranged with team management to have Belichick succeed him. However, Belichick was the Jets' head coach for only one day. On January 4, 2000, when Belichick was introduced as head coach to the media‚Äîthe day after his hiring was publicized‚Äîhe turned it into a surprise resignation announcement. Before taking the podium, Belichick scrawled a resignation note on a napkin that read, in its entirety, \"I resign as HC of the NYJ.\" He then delivered a half-hour speech explaining his resignation to the assembled press corps.[48] Soon after this bizarre turn of events, Belichick was introduced as the Patriots' 12th full-time head coach, succeeding the recently fired Pete Carroll.[49] The Patriots had inquired to the Jets about permission to interview him for their vacant spot at head coach just prior to Parcells stepping down.[50] Parcells and the Jets claimed that Belichick was still under contract to the Jets, and demanded compensation from the Patriots. NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue agreed, and the Patriots gave the Jets a first-round draft pick in 2000 in exchange for the right to hire Belichick.[51] Soon after hiring Belichick, owner Robert Kraft gave him near-complete control over the team's football operations, making him the de facto general manager as well. Until 2009, Belichick split many of the duties normally held by a general manager on other clubs with player personnel director Scott Pioli, though Belichick had the final say on football matters.[52] Pioli left for the Kansas City Chiefs after the 2008 season.[53] The Patriots went 5‚Äì11 in the 2000 regular season and missed the playoffs.[54] In 2001, the Patriots went 11‚Äì5 in the regular season, and in the playoffs defeated the Oakland Raiders (in the \"Tuck Rule Game\") and Pittsburgh Steelers on the way to the Super Bowl.[55][56] In Super Bowl XXXVI, Belichick's defense held the St. Louis Rams' offense, which had averaged 31 points during the season, to 17 points, and the Patriots won on a last-second field goal by Adam Vinatieri.[57] The win was the first Super Bowl championship in Patriots history.[58] The following season (2002)‚Äîthe first in Gillette Stadium‚Äîthe Patriots went 9‚Äì7 and missed the playoffs.[59] New England finished with the same record as the New York Jets and the Miami Dolphins, but the Jets won the AFC East title as a result of the third tiebreaker (record among common opponents).[60] The Patriots' 2003 season started with a 31‚Äì0 loss to the Buffalo Bills in Week 1, a few days after they released team defensive captain Lawyer Milloy.[61][62] However, they dominated through the remainder of the season to finish 14‚Äì2, setting a new franchise record for wins in a season.[63] In the final week of the regular season, the Patriots avenged their loss to the Bills by the same 31‚Äì0 score.[64] They defeated the Tennessee Titans in the divisional round of the playoffs. Playing against the Indianapolis Colts and Co-MVP Peyton Manning in the AFC Championship Game (Steve McNair of the Titans was also Co-MVP), the Patriots recorded four interceptions, and advanced to Super Bowl XXXVIII, where they defeated the Carolina Panthers 32‚Äì29 on a late Adam Vinatieri field goal.[65][66] Belichick was awarded the NFL Coach of the Year Award. In 2004, the Patriots once again finished with a 14‚Äì2 record, and they defeated the Indianapolis Colts in the divisional round of the playoffs.[67][68] They opened the season at 6‚Äì0, which combined with the 15 straight wins to end the previous season, gave New England 21 consecutive victories to break the record for most wins in a row formerly held by the Miami Dolphins with 18 straight victories in the 1972 and 1973 seasons. They defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Championship Game. In Super Bowl XXXIX, the Patriots beat the Philadelphia Eagles and became only the second team to win three Super Bowls in four years.[69][70] Belichick is the only coach to accomplish the feat as the Dallas Cowboys had two head coaches in the stretch they won three of four from 1992 to 1995. With a new defensive coordinator in Eric Mangini and no named offensive coordinator, the Patriots went 10‚Äì6 in the 2005 season and defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars in the Wild Card Round before losing to the Denver Broncos in the Divisional Round.[71][72][73] Earlier, with a season-opening win over the Oakland Raiders, Belichick notched his 54th win with the Patriots, passing Mike Holovak as the winningest coach in Patriots history. The Patriots finished with a 12‚Äì4 record in the 2006 season and defeated the New York Jets by a score of 37‚Äì16 in the Wild Card Round.[74][75] They then beat the San Diego Chargers the next week in the Divisional Round, before losing to the eventual Super Bowl XLI champion Indianapolis Colts in the AFC Championship by a score of 38‚Äì34.[76][77] The Patriots led 21‚Äì3 midway through the second quarter, but the Colts mounted one of the great comebacks in playoff history.[78] In 2007, Belichick led the Patriots to the first perfect regular season since the introduction of the 16-game regular season schedule in 1978, only the fourth team to do so in National Football League history after the 1934[79] and 1942 Chicago Bears[80] and 1972 Miami Dolphins. In the Divisional Round of the playoffs, they defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars by a score of 31‚Äì20. In the AFC Championship, the Patriots defeated the San Diego Chargers by a score of 21‚Äì12. The Patriots were upset in Super Bowl XLII 17‚Äì14 by the New York Giants, his former team, due to the defense allowing a famous play to David Tyree near the end of regulation.[81] The Patriots' failure to attain a \"perfect season\" (undefeated and untied, including playoffs) preserved the Miami Dolphins as the sole team to do so, having finished their 1972 regular season at 14‚Äì0 and having won three games in the playoffs. Only two other teams in professional football have recorded a perfect season‚Äîthe 1948 Cleveland Browns (14‚Äì0) of the then All-America Football Conference and the 1948 Calgary Stampeders (12‚Äì0) of the Canadian Football League. No team in the former American Football League ever had a perfect season. During the Patriots' 2008 season-opener against the Kansas City Chiefs, quarterback Tom Brady sustained a season-ending injury in the first quarter.[82] Backup quarterback Matt Cassel was named the starter for the remainder of the season. However, with a win in Week 2, the Patriots broke their own record for regular season wins in a row with 21 (2006‚Äì08). After losing over 12 players to the injured reserve list, including Rodney Harrison, Adalius Thomas, and Laurence Maroney, the Patriots still managed their league-leading eighth consecutive season with a winning record, going 11‚Äì5.[83] However, the Patriots, who finished second in the AFC East, missed the playoffs for the first time since 2002, losing on tiebreakers to the Miami Dolphins (who won the division on the fourth tiebreaker, better conference record) and the Baltimore Ravens (who beat out the Patriots for the last playoff spot due to a better conference record).[84] The 1985 Denver Broncos are the only other 11-win team to miss the playoffs in a 16-game season.[85] In 2009, with a fully healthy Tom Brady back as the starting quarterback, Belichick was able to guide the Patriots to yet another AFC East division title with a 10‚Äì6 record.[86] However, the Patriots lost to the Baltimore Ravens in the Wild Card Round.[87] In an incident dubbed \"Spygate\",[88] on September 9, 2007, NFL security caught a Patriots video assistant taping the New York Jets' defensive signals from the sidelines, which is not an approved location. The NFL rules state: \"No video recording devices of any kind are permitted to be in use in the coaches' booth, on the field, or in the locker room during the game.\" Jets coach Eric Mangini, a former Patriots assistant, tipped off league officials that the Patriots might have been filming their signals. After the game, the Jets formally complained to the league. On September 13, the NFL fined Belichick $500,000‚Äîthe largest fine ever imposed on a coach in the league's 87-year history,[89] and fined the Patriots $250,000. Additionally, the Patriots forfeited their first-round draft pick in the 2008 NFL draft. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, a former employee of the Jets, said that he fined the Patriots as a team because Belichick exercises so much control over the Patriots' on-field operations that \"his actions and decisions are properly attributed to the club.\" Goodell considered suspending Belichick but decided that taking away draft picks would be more severe in the long run.[90] Gary Myers, a columnist for New York's Daily News columnist, stated Belichick should have been suspended by Goodell for the Patriots' next game against the Jets.[91] Belichick later issued the following statement: I accept full responsibility for the actions that led to tonight's ruling. Once again, I apologize to the Kraft family and every person directly or indirectly associated with the New England Patriots for the embarrassment, distraction and penalty my mistake caused. I also apologize to Patriots fans and would like to thank them for their support during the past few days and throughout my career. [...] As the Commissioner acknowledged, our use of sideline video had no impact on the outcome of last week's game. We have never used sideline video to obtain a competitive advantage while the game was in progress. [...] Part of my job as head coach is to ensure that our football operations are conducted in compliance of the league rules and all accepted interpretations of them. My interpretation of a rule in the Constitution and Bylaws was incorrect. [...] With tonight's resolution, I will not be offering any further comments on this matter. We are moving on with our preparations for Sunday's game. The sanctions against Belichick were the harshest imposed on a head coach in league history until the New Orleans Saints' Sean Payton was suspended for the entire 2012 season for covering up a scheme in which bounties were paid for deliberately knocking opponents out of games. Following the incident and its fallout, Belichick led the Patriots to a perfect 16‚Äì0 regular season record, and was awarded the 2007 NFL Coach of the Year Award, as voted on by the Associated Press.[92] In the 2010 season, Belichick and the Patriots finished with a 14‚Äì2 record for the top seed in the AFC.[93] However, their postseason ended quickly with a 28‚Äì21 loss to the New York Jets in the divisional round.[94] In the 2011 season, the Patriots topped the AFC with a 13‚Äì3 record.[95] Following a victory over the Denver Broncos in the divisional round of the playoffs, the Patriots won the AFC Championship game, beating the Baltimore Ravens 23‚Äì20 when the Ravens failed to score a touchdown and Baltimore's kicker, Billy Cundiff, missed a routine 32-yard field goal attempt to tie the game and send it into overtime.[96][97] This sent New England to their fifth Super Bowl under Belichick. In Super Bowl XLVI, the Patriots lost in the Super Bowl XLII rematch to the New York Giants by a score of 21‚Äì17.[98] On September 26, 2012, following a 31‚Äì30 loss to the Baltimore Ravens, Belichick was fined $50,000 for grabbing a replacement official's arm while asking for more specific clarity on a ruling after Baltimore had narrowly converted a last-second field goal attempt to secure the win.[99] The Patriots finished the 2012 regular season with a 12‚Äì4 record. In the divisional round of the playoffs, they defeated the Houston Texans by a score of 41‚Äì28 and made it to the AFC Championship Game, where they lost to the eventual Super Bowl XLVII champion Baltimore Ravens by a score of 28‚Äì13, ending their season.[100][101] The Patriots began the 2013 season with much upheaval on the offensive side of the ball with the injury of Rob Gronkowski, the arrest and subsequent release of Aaron Hernandez, the departures of Wes Welker to the Denver Broncos and Danny Woodhead to the San Diego Chargers in free agency, and the release of Brandon Lloyd. To replace them, the Patriots signed Danny Amendola in free agency, drafted rookies Aaron Dobson and Josh Boyce, and signed undrafted rookie free agent Kenbrell Thompkins. The team finished the season with a 12‚Äì4 record, winning the AFC East and securing a playoff berth and a first-round bye, seeding second in the AFC standings.[102] In the Divisional Round, they defeated the Indianapolis Colts by a score of 43‚Äì22.[103] They lost to the Denver Broncos in the AFC Championship Game by a score of 26‚Äì16.[104] In the 2014 season, Belichick's Patriots started 2‚Äì2. At a mid-week press conference following a 41‚Äì14 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, Belichick famously uttered, \"We're on to Cincinnati\" (referring to the Patriots' next opponent), several times in response to follow-up questions and criticisms of his team, Brady in particular.[105] Ultimately, they recorded a 12‚Äì4 record for the third straight season.[106] In the Divisional Round, they defeated the Baltimore Ravens by a score of 35‚Äì31.[107] During the AFC Championship Game, they defeated the Indianapolis Colts by a score of 45‚Äì7.[108] They reached Super Bowl XLIX, where they defeated the Seattle Seahawks by a score of 28‚Äì24.[109] With his fourth championship as head coach, Belichick tied Chuck Noll for most Super Bowl wins by a head coach.[110] In the 2015 season, the Patriots recorded a 12‚Äì4 record for the fourth straight season.[111] They defeated the Kansas City Chiefs in the Divisional Round by a score of 27‚Äì20.[112] During the AFC Championship Game, the Patriots narrowly lost to the eventual Super Bowl 50 champion Denver Broncos by a score of 20‚Äì18.[113] In the 2016 season, the Patriots recorded a 14‚Äì2 record, which earned them the #1 seed for the AFC playoffs.[114] In the Divisional Round, they defeated the Houston Texans by a score of 34‚Äì16.[115] During the AFC Championship Game, they defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers by a score of 36‚Äì17.[116] They reached Super Bowl LI, where they defeated the Atlanta Falcons in a comeback victory by a score of 34‚Äì28 in overtime.[117] The Patriots were down 28‚Äì3 at one point in the third quarter.[118] With the victory, Belichick won his record fifth Super Bowl title as a head coach.[119] In the 2017 season, the Patriots went 13‚Äì3, setting an NFL record eighth consecutive 12-or-more-win seasons, capturing their ninth consecutive AFC East title and their 15th of the last 17 seasons. They defeated the Tennessee Titans in the Divisional Round by a score of 35‚Äì14 and the Jacksonville Jaguars in the AFC Championship Game by a score of 24‚Äì20, claiming their second consecutive AFC title, while also extending their record of consecutive AFC Championship Game appearances with seven.[120][121] Super Bowl LII was Belichick's eighth title game as head coach and his eleventh overall in any capacity, which was also the Patriots' tenth appearance, all extending NFL records. The Ringer wrote that Belichick's \"team is different from many of New England's famous teams from the previous decade: The first iteration of the Patriots dynasty relied on defense. This year, they are 29th in yards allowed (though fifth in points allowed) and instead have perfected the art of situational football.\" The latter Patriots teams were noted for mounting late comebacks in playoff games.[122][123] However, the Patriots fell to the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LII, 41‚Äì33, as Eagles quarterback Nick Foles repeated his dominant NFC Championship Game performance and led Philadelphia to victory in a high-scoring game. The Patriots were down early, as they had been in most of their Super Bowl wins. However, they could not make a comeback this time, although they came very close. Eagles defensive end Brandon Graham strip-sacked Tom Brady to get the ball back with about two minutes to go in the fourth quarter. The Patriots did get the ball again before the end of the game, but they ran out of time to score.[124] In the 2018 season, the Patriots went 11‚Äì5, failing to win 12 or more games for the first time since 2009. Despite this, they still captured their 10th consecutive AFC East title and their 16th of the last 18 years. They defeated the Los Angeles Chargers in the Divisional Round by a score of 41‚Äì28 and the Kansas City Chiefs during the AFC Championship Game 37‚Äì31 in a tough overtime game in Kansas City to advance to their third straight Super Bowl.[125][126] In Super Bowl LIII, the Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams 13‚Äì3 to give Belichick his sixth Super Bowl championship as a head coach and his eighth overall to have the most Super Bowl rings in NFL history. His six championships matched both George Halas and Curly Lambeau for most championships as a head coach. The Patriots' defense held the high-scoring Rams offense to only 260 total yards.[127][128] On May 13, 2019, Belichick announced that he would assume another role as the Patriots' defensive coordinator starting the 2019 season.[129] On October 27, 2019, with the Patriots' win over the Cleveland Browns, Belichick obtained his 300th win, regular and postseason combined, as a head coach.[130] The Patriots finished the 2019 regular season with a 12‚Äì4 record, winning their 11th consecutive AFC East title.[131] However, the Patriots were defeated in the Wild Card Round of the playoffs by the Tennessee Titans, led by former Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel, by a score of 20‚Äì13.[132] Following the departure of Tom Brady to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Belichick and the Patriots were faced with an uncertain quarterback situation for the first time in nearly two decades.[133] During the offseason, the Patriots signed former Carolina Panthers starter Cam Newton for the 2020 NFL season.[134] The off-season routines and schedules, as well as the normal processes of regular season were severely disrupted by the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the unanticipated difficulties and challenges of the pandemic, the Patriots were in the hunt for a playoff spot until late in the season, ultimately finishing 7‚Äì9. The 2020 season was Belichick's first losing season since his first year in New England.[135] In the 2021 NFL draft, the Patriots selected quarterback Mac Jones with the 15th overall pick.[136] After Jones and Newton competed for the starting job during the preseason, Belichick made the decision to release Newton and name Jones the starter for the upcoming season.[137][138] During Week 4, Brady's Tampa Bay Buccaneers visited the Patriots in his first trip to Gillette Stadium since signing with the Buccaneers. A missed 56-yard field goal by Patriots kicker Nick Folk allowed Tampa Bay to narrowly escape with a 19‚Äì17 victory.[139] Immediately after the game, Brady and Belichick shared a quick embrace on the field before Brady greeted his former teammates and other members of the Patriots organization.[140] Though fans criticized Belichick for his lack of warmth displayed towards his former quarterback, the two privately spoke at length in the Buccaneers locker room following the match.[141] Belichick helped lead the Patriots to a 10‚Äì7 record in 2021. The team fell to the Buffalo Bills in the Wild Card Round by a score of 47‚Äì17.[142] In the 2022 season, despite starting quarterback Mac Jones being injured in Week 3 and subsequently missing three more weeks, the Patriots remained in the hunt for a playoff spot until the last week, finishing with a record of 8‚Äì9.[143][144] During Week 4 of the 2023 season, the Patriots lost to the Dallas Cowboys by a score of 38‚Äì3.[145] In doing so, Belichick suffered the worst loss of his coaching career (35 points).[146] The following week, the Patriots lost to the Saints by a score of 34‚Äì0, giving Belichick his worst home loss of his career.[147] Two weeks later, New England upset the Buffalo Bills 29‚Äì25 to earn Belichick his 300th career regular season win as an NFL head coach.[148] After a Week 10 10‚Äì6 loss to the Indianapolis Colts in Germany and subsequent bye week, Belichick named Bailey Zappe the team's starting quarterback.[149] In Belichick's final game with New England, the Patriots lost to the New York Jets 17‚Äì3, snapping the team's 15-game winning streak over the Jets. The Patriots finished the season with a 4‚Äì13 record, the team's worst in Belichick's 24 seasons as head coach.[150] On January 11, 2024, Belichick and the Patriots mutually agreed to part ways.[151] On January 15, Belichick was interviewed by the Atlanta Falcons for their head coaching position, but ultimately did not get the job as the Falcons hired Raheem Morris instead.[152] Under Belichick, the Patriots had a regular-season record of 266‚Äì121‚Äì0 over 24 seasons.[153] Belichick is the most successful coach in Patriots history; his 266 wins with the franchise are more than quadruple those of runner-up Mike Holovak.[154] Belichick also compiled a 30‚Äì12 record in the playoffs with New England, including a 6‚Äì3 record in Super Bowls. He led the Patriots to 17 divisional titles, including five consecutive titles from 2003 to 2007 and eleven consecutive titles from 2009 to 2019. This streak of 11 consecutive playoff appearances is the most in NFL history for any team.[155] On December 11, 2024, Belichick was named the 35th head football coach of the North Carolina Tar Heels football team. This would be Belichick's first time coaching at the collegiate level.[156] While still serving as head coach for the Patriots in 2019, Belichick appeared as one of three main analysts, alongside host Rich Eisen and Cris Collinsworth, for the NFL 100 All-Time Team series on NFL Network, serving as a voter, in addition to providing his analysis of each member's significance and breaking down tape of highlight plays. Belichick was chosen in these roles due to his exceptional knowledge of American football, to the extent that he and fellow former head coach John Madden were specifically assigned to look over film of the earliest players selected to the team.[157] Belichick was awarded a Sports Emmy in 2021 for his contributions to the series.[158] After mutually parting ways with the Patriots in 2024, Belichick, while still declaring himself an active head coach, officially agreed to appear every Monday afternoon during the 2024 NFL season with ESPN's The Pat McAfee Show, first appearing as an analyst on the show during its \"5th Annual Draft Spectacular\", covering the 2024 NFL draft, following a guest appearance weeks prior.[159][160] \"I can't tell you the advantage to having a defensive coach to take the quarterback behind the ropes on that defense, it made me a better quarterback, so Bill's gonna do that. I think the audience is going to be fascinated at how smart he is. Look, you guys saw how witty he is. I watched the Draft show you guys did; it was awesome. He's quick-witted, he's funny and like I said, he's brilliant when it comes to defense and offense, the guy can flat-out coach.\"[161] ‚ÄìPeyton Manning on Belichick as an analyst, May 2024 Peyton Manning revealed during the Netflix special The Roast of Tom Brady that Belichick would join another ESPN program, joining the Manning brothers (Peyton and Eli) in the Manningcast, an alternate live television broadcast of Monday Night Football.[162] A week afterward, Manning stated during an appearance on The Pat McAfee Show that Belichick would appear on every Manningcast broadcast during the 2024 season.[161] Bill Belichick has worked under six head coaches: Twenty of Belichick's assistant coaches have become NFL or NCAA head coaches (not including interim tenures): During the offseason, Belichick visits other football programs to learn from their experiences. For example, he has studied the Navy run offense, sought Bill Walsh (in past years) to understand more about the San Francisco 49ers as an organization and the West Coast offense as a system,[190] and spent time with Jimmy Johnson to learn about drafting and contract negotiations.[191] Belichick also learned about defensive backs from Bill Cowher and wanted to hire Cowher as an assistant, though Cowher opted to stay loyal to Marty Schottenheimer.[192] The track record of Belichick's coaching tree has been characterized as poor. Former assistant coaches under Belichick had a combined 208‚Äì296‚Äì1 (.413) record as head coaches of their own teams through November 28, 2020, and a number of them ended their brief tenures as head coaches by being fired midseason.[193] As of the end of the 2020 season, the only members of this coaching tree to have career NFL head coaching records above .500 were former coaches Groh (9‚Äì7) and O'Brien (52‚Äì48 during season, 2‚Äì4 in playoffs).[194] Nick Saban and Belichick are good friends. In 2007, when Belichick spoke about their relationship, he said: \"Two successful Croats in the same division of NFL. You must admit, you don't see that every day.\"[195] In May 2018, President Donald Trump appointed Belichick to be a member of his Council on Sports, Fitness & Nutrition.[196] Belichick has an Alaskan Klee Kai dog named Nike.[197] Interest in the breed surged after Nike made an appearance on camera during the 2020 NFL draft.[198] Belichick has dual Croatian/American citizenship.[199] He received Croatian citizenship on June 3, 2024, in Banski dvori in Zagreb from the Croatian prime minister Andrej Plenkoviƒá.[200] He was also special guest of the association football friendly match on Stadion Rujevica between Croatia and North Macedonia.[201] Belichick was married to Debby Clarke from 1977 to 2006.[202][203] They have three children. Their daughter Amanda played lacrosse at Wesleyan University, and she is the head women's lacrosse coach at the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts in July 2015.[204] Their son Stephen played lacrosse and football at Rutgers University, served as an assistant coach with the Patriots, and is currently the defensive coordinator for the University of Washington.[205] Their son Brian is an assistant coach with the Patriots.[206] Starting in 2007, Belichick was in a relationship with Linda Holliday, the executive director of the Bill Belichick Foundation.[207][208] The relationship ended in 2023. In June 2024, it was reported that Belichick was in a relationship with Jordon Hudson, who is a 24-year-old former cheerleader.[209] On January 10, 2021, Politico reported then-President Donald Trump planned to award Belichick the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[210] Belichick indicated that he was flattered to be considered for the honor, but declined the award in a statement issued the next day.[211] His statement referenced the January 6 United States Capitol attack, which the House of Representatives had accused Trump of provoking when it impeached for the second time of his presidency, and cited Belichick's \"great reverence for our nation's values, freedom and democracy\" in light of that event.[212][213] A number of Massachusetts politicians, including Senator Ed Markey and Representative Jim McGovern, had previously called on him to decline after news of the award became public.[214] # denotes interim head coach # denotes de facto general manager # denotes interim head coach # denotes de facto general manager",

                "content": "Editions: En/nfl Hudson expresses joy over Bill's coaching role Bill Belichick's recent move to Chapel Hill has stirred excitement not only among sports enthusiasts but also in his personal circle. His girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, couldn't contain her joy regarding his new role as the head coach of the North Carolina Tar Heels. The 24-year-old former cheerleader took to social media to share her enthusiasm, posting an image of the announcement that Belichick would be taking on this prestigious position at UNC. She captioned her Instagram story with, \"We are onto Chapel Hill!!!\" This was a playful nod to Belichick's famous \"we're on to Cincinnati\" remark from a press conference a decade ago. The University of North Carolina made it official on Wednesday night, confirming they had secured the six-time Super Bowl champion for the next five years. This move marks a significant shift in Belichick's illustrious career, as he will be coaching a college program for the first time in his 49-year coaching journey. Reflecting on this new chapter, Belichick stated, \"I am excited for the opportunity at UNC-Chapel Hill. I grew up around college football with my dad and treasured those times. I have always wanted to coach in college and now I look forward to building the football program in Chapel Hill.\" His statement highlights a deep-rooted passion for college football, fueled by cherished memories from his childhood. Belichick's departure from the New England Patriots came after an impressive 24 seasons, during which he led the team to six Super Bowl victories. His transition to UNC has sparked various reactions across the sports community. Notably, Lawrence Taylor expressed enthusiasm about Belichick's move, while Tom Brady also weighed in on this unexpected career shift. Hudson and Belichick's relationship has also been a topic of interest for many, especially given their 48-year age gap. The couple first caught public attention in June when news of their relationship surfaced. Recently, they made their first major red carpet appearance at The Museum Gala held at the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan. This event marked a significant moment for the couple, showcasing their relationship under the public eye. In addition to celebrating Belichick's new role, Hudson has been sharing glimpses of their personal life on social media. She recently posted photos of the couple enjoying the holiday season in Nantucket, Massachusetts. These posts reflect a shared joy and excitement for the future, both personally and professionally. ¬© Unidad Editorial Informaci√≥n Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved. Follow us",

                "title": "Sources -- Bill Belichick speaks with UNC about head coach job - ESPN",
                "content": "NEW! Find where to watch all of your favorite sports! Bill Belichick, who won six Super Bowl championships with the New England Patriots, has had discussions with North Carolina about the Tar Heels' head-coaching job, sources told ESPN on Thursday. Belichick, 72, has been out of football this year after leaving the Patriots following the 2023 season. Sources told ESPN that Belichick, who has spent his career in the NFL, wants to coach again and is open to listening to people at the college and NFL level. UNC fired Mack Brown on Nov. 26 after six seasons with the Tar Heels. The 73-year-old Brown, a College Football Hall of Famer, was in his second stint at the school. Belichick is only a year younger than Brown, who was the oldest coach in the FBS this season. The Tar Heels went 44-33 under Brown from 2019 to 2024 and finished 6-6 this season. Brown will not coach in UNC's bowl game, and Freddie Kitchens, a former Cleveland Browns coach who has served as UNC's run game coordinator and tight ends coach the past two seasons, is serving as interim head coach while the school seeks a replacement. Belichick is far and away the biggest name to surface in the North Carolina search, and sources said there was genuine interest on both sides. But Tulane's Jon Sumrall was also at or near the top of North Carolina's list and was expected to speak formally with school officials after the Green Wave's AAC championship game against Army on Friday. Other candidates for the job include Iowa State's Matt Campbell, Georgia defensive coordinator Glenn Schumann, and Steve Wilks, who was the Arizona Cardinals' head coach in 2018 and the Carolina Panthers' interim head coach in 2022. Wilks was a volunteer assistant this season at Charlotte. North Carolina had initially targeted Pittsburgh Steelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith, a UNC graduate, but he declined the Tar Heels' overtures and instead wanted to remain in the NFL. During Belichick's hiatus from coaching, he has made the media rounds this season. He's a regular on the \"ManningCast\" during ESPN's \"Monday Night Football\" and \"The Pat McAfee Show\" on ESPN and also part of the \"Inside the NFL\" crew on the CW Network. Belichick was with the Patriots for 24 seasons. He was also a part of two Super Bowl-winning teams with the New York Giants as Bill Parcells' defensive coordinator. Belichick's 333 wins as a head coach are second all time in the NFL to Don Shula's 347. Although Belichick never has coached in college, his father, Steve, was a longtime assistant at the U.S. Naval Academy, and Belichick grew up in Annapolis, Maryland. InsideCarolina.com was the first to report that Belichick had interviewed with UNC. Information from ESPN's Adam Schefter was used in this report.",
