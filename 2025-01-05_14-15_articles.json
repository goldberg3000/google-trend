                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. BALTIMORE (AP) The road to a division title was bumpy for the Baltimore Ravens, who started 0-2, faced a schedule packed with playoff teams and had to rally from a two-game deficit with four to play. Having overcome all that, Lamar Jackson is looking ahead to the most important challenges of all - in the postseason. “I'm focused on the wild-card game, I'm not going to lie to you,” Jackson said. “I'm cool with what's going on today. I'm cool, don't get me wrong, but my mind's on something else.” Jackson threw two touchdown passes, and the Ravens won the AFC North for the second straight season, clinching the division with a 35-10 victory over the Cleveland Browns on Saturday. Now the Ravens (12-5) will try to reach the Super Bowl for the first time with Jackson. They open the playoffs at home against either the Los Angeles Chargers or Pittsburgh Steelers. Baltimore was two games behind the Steelers in the division before closing with four consecutive victories. Cleveland (3-14) ended a dreadful season with six straight losses. Both Bailey Zappe and Dorian Thompson-Robinson took snaps at quarterback in the finale. Neither could move the ball much, and Zappe had an interception returned 26 yards for a touchdown by rookie Nate Wiggins for the game's first points. The biggest concern coming out of this game for the Ravens was the health of Pro Bowl receiver Zay Flowers, who left in the second quarter with a right knee injury. Jackson threw TD passes to Mark Andrews in the second quarter and Rashod Bateman in the third, finishing a spectacular statistical season that might be good enough to earn him a third MVP award. Jackson finished the season with 4,172 yards passing, 41 touchdown passes and four interceptions. He became the first quarterback to reach 4,000 yards passing with 40 TD passes and four or fewer interceptions. Jackson also finished the season with 915 yards rushing, becoming the first player to throw for 4,000 yards and rush for at least 800. His passer rating of 119.6 wasn't quite high enough to break the single-season record of 122.5 held by Aaron Rodgers. Zappe threw for 170 yards with two interceptions. His 16-yard scoring pass to Jordan Akins made it 21-10 in the fourth, but the Ravens answered with 70-yard drive that ended with a 2-yard touchdown run by Derrick Henry. Henry, who turned 31 on Saturday, added a 43-yard scoring run late in the fourth. He finished the season with 1,921 yards rushing and a franchise-record 16 touchdowns on the ground. Cleveland has now gone 28 consecutive games without allowing a 300-yard passer. Jackson finished 16 of 32 for 217 yards. “I respect this game, these players do. It’s a privilege to play, it’s a privilege to coach,” said Browns coach Kevin Stefanski, whose team was a 20-point underdog shortly before kickoff according to BetMGM. “If they’re keeping score, we’re going to compete to the end.” Cleveland's Myles Garrett entered the game tied for the NFL lead with 14 sacks, but although the Browns pressured Jackson at times, nobody could sack him. Garrett did have a tackle for loss. Cincinnati's Trey Hendrickson, who also came into the day with 14, moved ahead of Garrett with an early sack in the Bengals' game against Pittsburgh on Saturday night. “Lamar is a very difficult quarterback to sack, but Myles played the run and battled,” Stefanski said. Ravens defensive lineman Michael Pierce, listed at a rotund 355 pounds, picked off a pass late in the fourth - his first interception in nine NFL seasons. He had some room to run but gave himself up with a fairly nimble slide before being mobbed by teammates. “The most amazing play in NFL history right there,” coach John Harbaugh said. Although the Ravens finished against the last-place Browns, Harbaugh said they should be well prepared for the postseason. In fact, unless Miami snags the final wild card, Baltimore will have already faced every other team in the AFC playoff field. “Same level of competition that we’ve been playing against,\" Harbaugh said. \"We’ve played all the teams in the playoffs.” Cleveland DT Mike Hall Jr. was carted off with a knee injury in the third quarter. ... Browns CB Mike Ford Jr. injured his forearm. ... Cleveland CB Martin Emerson Jr. injured an ankle. Baltimore's postseason opener could feature a coaching matchup between Harbaugh and his brother, Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh. Or perhaps a divisional clash between the Ravens and Steelers. Cleveland can look ahead to the draft after the team's quarterback situation appeared as unstable as ever this season. --- AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl Copyright 2025 STATS LLC and Associated Press.

                "title": "Browns lose game to Ravens as Lamar Jackson, Derrick Henry star",
                "content": "BALTIMORE — The Baltimore Ravens are AFC North champions. The Cleveland Browns are waiting to see if they'll pick No. 1 overall in April's draft. Cleveland lingered around for the better part of three quarters before the Ravens opened things up in the fourth quarter. The result was a 35-10 Baltimore win that ended the Browns' season at 3-14. It's the worst mark for Cleveland since it finished 0-16 in 2017. Baltimore, which clinched the division title with the win, is 12-5. Bailey Zappe was 16-of-31 passing for 171 yards with a touchdowns and two interceptions, one of which was returned for a Ravens touchdown, in his first start for the Browns. Dorian Thompson-Robinson was 2-of-3 passing for 13 yards in his only series. The Browns need both the New England Patriots and Tennessee Titans to lose on Sunday in order to jump to No. 1 in the draft. They can't draft any lower than No. 3. Here's how today's season finale in Charm City unfolded for the Browns: Wide receiver Jerry Jeudy took two short passes to open the Browns' drive to pass Ozzie Newsome and Kellen Winslow II for the franchise record for receptions with 90. His total topped Ozzie Newsome, who did it twice, and Kellen Winslow II in 2006, for the mark. The Ravens now lead 35-10 with 3:04 remaining after Derrick Henry got loose for a 43-yard touchdown run. Henry has 138 yards, 130 of those in the second half, on 20 carries with two touchdowns. The Ravens had a forceful answer to the Browns' touchdown. Running back Derrick Henry's 2-yard touchdown run with 6:44 remaining capped an eight-play, 70-yard scoring drive to make it 28-10 Baltimire. It was Henry's 15th rushing touchdown of the season, setting a new Baltimore single-season record. The former mark of 14 was set by Jamal Lewis in 2003. The Browns have reached double figures for the first time since their Week 14 loss in Pittsburgh. Quarterback Bailey Zappe hit tight end Jordan Akins for a 16-yard touchdown with 11:33 remaining, cutting the Ravens lead to 21-10. Jamari Thrash grabbed a pass down the left sideline from quarterback Bailey Zappe. The rookie wide receiver was credited with a touchdown, even though the ball came loose after he was in the end zone. Replay showed Thrash never completed the catch, making it second and 10 from the Ravens 30 with 13:42 remaining. The Ravens lead by 18 points going into the final 15 minutes. The Browns currently face a third and 16 at their own 38. The Browns announced cornerback Martin Emerson Jr. has an ankle injury. He is questionable to return. Cornerback Mike Ford Jr. went to the locker room after a visit to the medical tent for the Browns. He was shaken up on a 2-yard run by Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson. Ford is questionable to return with a forearm injury. Lamar Jackson fired a strike to a wide-open Rashod Bateman for a 7-yard touchdown pass with 10:42 remaining in the third quarter. It gave the Ravens a 21-3 lead. Browns rookie Mike Hall Jr. sustained an injury to his right knee that required him to have an air cast placed on it. He was carted off the field after the injury, which occurred with 13:27 remaining in the third quarter. Hall, the Streetsboro High School and Ohio State product, spent four weeks on injured reserve after an MCL in his right knee prior to the Week 11 game against the New Orleans Saints. He also lost five games to a suspension for a domestic violence charge he was arrested for in August. The Browns announced he was out shortly afterward. The Ravens will take an 11-point lead into the locker room for halftime. Baltimore will also have the second-half kickoff to receive. Bailey Zappe was 5-of-11 passing for 55 yards with an interception and a 22.9 passer rating. Dorian Thompson-Robinson was 2-of-3 passing for 13 yards and a 75.7 rating in his one series for the Browns. Baltimore's Lamar Jackson was 10-of-21 passing for 108 yards with a touchdown and a 79.1 rating. He's also gained 59 yards on six rushing attempts. The Browns defense bowed up again, this time on a fourth and 3 from their own 23. Quarterback Lamar Jackson was pressured by multiple defensive linemen and threw a pass to tight end Mark Andrews that was broken up by cornerback Cameron Mitchell. The deflected ball nearly was caught by a diving wide receiver Rashod Bateman, but he couldn't hold on with 2:55 remaining in the second quarter. Dustin Hopkins made a 23-yard field goal to get Cleveland on the board. The Browns trail the Ravens 14-3 with 6:33 remaining in the second quarter. Two penalties on Baltimore nose tackle Travis Jones helped set up the Browns at the Ravens 10. One was a roughing the passer on third and 3 from the Baltimore 33, the other a holding call after a 3-yard D'Onta Foreman run on second and 10 from the Baltimore 18. Bailey Zappe returned to quarterback for the Browns to start their fifth possession. Dorian Thompson-Robinson was in for one series, going 2 of 3 for 13 yards. The Ravens have pushed their lead to 14-0 as quarterback Lamar Jackson found tight end Mark Andrew on a 12-yard touchdown pass. Baltimore suffered a significant injury on the drive as wide receiver Zay Flowers sustained a knee injury on a 12-yard catch and run and is questionable to return. The Ravens have a 7-0 lead over the Browns at the end of one quarter. Cleveland has a third and 14 from its own 16 to start the second quarter. The Browns made a quarterback change on their fourth possession, going to Dorian Thompson-Robinson. Bailey Zappe was 1 of 3 for 21 yards with an interception returned for a touchdown. The Browns defense managed to turn the Ravens away. But not without Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson almost pulling another sensational play out. On fourth and 1 from the Browns 9, Jackson took off running to the right. Just as he was getting hit by safety Grant Delpit, he threw what looked like almost a baby hook of a pass to running back Derrick Henry, who was in the end zone. Henry got a finger on the pass, but couldn't bring it in. That gave the Browns the ball back with 2:41 remaining in the first quarter. The Browns tried to go for it on fourth and 1 from their own 39. They faked a run and quarterback Bailey Zappe threw a deep slant to wide receiver Jerry Jeudy that cornerback Marlon Humphrey broke up. Ravens first-round draft pick, cornerback Nate Wiggins, picked off Bailey Zappe on the second play of the second Browns possession. He returned it 26 yards for a Baltimore touchdown and a 7-0 lead with 8:32 left in the first quarter. That was the 22nd interception thrown by a Browns quarterback this season. Cleveland has intercepted four passes as a defense. The Ravens had to punt on their first drive, but not before reaching the Browns 47. It was also after they failed to connect on two potential big plays. On first down from the Baltimore 47, tight end Mark Andrews beat cornerback Martin Emerson Jr., but the pass was too long. On third and 5 from the Cleveland 47, a slant pass to Zay Flowers was dropped. The Browns may have lost another running back before he even carried the ball. John Kelly Jr. was questionable to return after the first Cleveland series due to a groin injury. Kelly was signed to the active roster on Tuesday due to injuries to Jerome Ford and Pierre Strong. Here's the first 11 on the field for the Browns defense: The Ravens won the toss and deferred. The Browns took the football and started with these 11 players: Shortly before the start of the season finale, Browns cornerback Martin Emerson Jr. was fined $8,012 for a facemask in the third quarter of last Sunday's loss to the Miami Dolphins. He was flagged for the penalty, which occurred with 14:09 remaining in the third quarter when he grabbed Miami's Tyreek Hill's facemask. Devin Bush was a late addition to the Browns injury report on Saturday. Turns out, the thigh injury the linebacker sustained will keep him out of the game. Bush was the only real surprise to the inactive list, only because of the late nature of the injury. He wasn't on the injury list before Saturday. The rest of the inactive players for the Browns are About four hours before kickoff, the Browns added another player to their injury list. This time, it was linebacker Devin Bush, who was questionable with a thigh injury. Kickoff is at 4:30 p.m. Tickets for Saturday's game on StubHub can be purchased on StubHub from $32 before fees. It's a mostly but chilly January afternoon in Baltimore, with the temperature at kickoff expected to be a high near 34, according to the National Weather Service. Breezy, with a west wind 13 to 20 mph, with gusts as high as 32 mph. Cleveland fell to 3-13 for the season with a 20-3 loss to the Miami Dolphins last Sunday afternoon in Cleveland. The Browns failed to score on three red-zone trips, while quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson threw an interception and also fumbled on a sack. The Ravens improved to 11-5 by beating the Houston Texans 31-2 on Christmas Day in Houston. Derrick Henry rushed for 147 yards and a touchdowns for the Ravens, while Lamar Jackson threw for 168 yards and a score, along with 87 rushing yards and a score. So what should we expect from the Browns this afternoon against the Ravens? Click here to see what our writers project as the score of today's game. Today is the 52nd all-time regular-season or playoff meeting between the Browns and the Ravens, which dates back to 1999, when Cleveland was awarded an expansion franchise to replace the former one which had moved to Baltimore in 1996 to become the Ravens. Here's a look at the series between the Browns and Ravens. The Browns announced Friday they were placing running backs Jerome Ford and Pierre Strong and tight end David Njoku on injured reserve. They also announced defensive tackle Dalvin Tomlinson, originally listed as questionable on Thursday with a knee injury, has been downgraded to out for the finale. The corresponding roster additions involved signing wide receiver Kaden Davis, defensive tackle Michael Dwumfour and safety Christopher Edmonds to the active roster from the practice squad. They also did standard game day elevations for cornerback Kahlef Hailassie and running back Jacob Kibodi from the practice squad. Chris Easterling can be reached at ceasterling@thebeaconjournal.com.

                "title": "Ravens vs. Browns score, takeaways: Baltimore secures AFC North title, No. 3 seed in AFC with blowout win - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Baltimore Ravens are AFC North champions and will enter the playoffs as the No. 3 seed in the conference. This division title comes as Baltimore came away with a 35-10 win over the Cleveland Browns at home to wrap up the regular season. This loss drops Cleveland to 3-14 to end its 2024 campaign. The Ravens were a bit slow to jump out to their lead, as the offense took a few drives to get moving. However, that didn't stop John Harbaugh's team from getting points on the scoreboard early. During Cleveland's second offensive possession of the night, rookie corner Nate Wiggins picked off Browns starter Bailey Zappe for his first career interception and returned it 26 yards for a touchdown. From there, Jackson led a touchdown drive in the opening minutes of the second quarter to build up a two-score lead at the break. Then the Ravens opened up the third quarter with a seven-play, 70-yard touchdown drive where Jackson found a wide-open Rashod Bateman to extend the lead. The second half -- particularly the fourth quarter -- was where Baltimore blew the doors open. After Zappe scored Cleveland's lone touchdown of the game on a pass to Jordan Akins, Baltimore scored back-to-back touchdowns to make it a 25-point lead. Derrick Henry was the catalyst of that run as he piled up 130 yards rushing and two touchdowns in the second half en route to the win and the division title. Lamar Jackson finished his night completing 16 of his 32 passes for 217 yards and two touchdowns. He also rushed for 63 yards. Thanks to those totals, Jackson became the first quarterback ever with 4,000 yards passing and 800 yards rushing in a single season. As for Zappe, he concluded his game 16 of 31 for 170 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions. For more on how this game unfolded, check out our main takeaways below. Simply put, Baltimore didn't beat itself in this game. They entered the matchup as roughly a 20-point favorite and largely executed as such. Defensively, they left little wiggle room for Bailey Zappe and the rest of the Browns offense to function. A first-quarter pick six by Nate Wiggins gave the Ravens the early lead, and the defense continued to smother the Browns, particularly on key downs. On third down, Baltimore allowed Cleveland to move the chains on just four of its 12 attempts and turned the ball over on downs on both fourth-down tries. Offensively, Lamar Jackson was largely in control throughout the evening, even as the unit struggled to put up points in the first half. Derrick Henry was limited to just 8 rushing yards over the first two quarters, but exploded with 130 yards rushing in the second half to go along with his two touchdowns. That helped slam the door shut on Cleveland, keeping this remotely close. The Browns were able to put together a punchy effort, but this was a David vs. Goliath matchup that they weren't set up to win. The club was put into an early hole after Zappe tossed that first-quarter pick six, which then had them playing from behind throughout the night. While they were forced into a more pass-heavy script, they couldn't run the football effectively anyway, as their backs averaged just 3.4 yards per attempt. While the defense did its best to slow down Lamar Jackson and Co. over the first half, the offense couldn't muster any more than a field goal to make it a game. And just as the offense started to get into a rhythm with Zappe connecting with Jordan Atkins for a 16-yard touchdown in the opening minutes of the fourth quarter to make it an 11-point deficit, the floor fell out from under the defense. Baltimore scored back-to-back touchdowns, sparked by Henry to push the lead to 25. Even with the Ravens holding a double-digit lead at halftime, Baltimore started to run away with this game out of the game to begin the second half. Lamar Jackson and Co. made it a 21-3 lead after marching 70 yards down the field on a seven-play drive that saw MVP flashes from Jackson. The two-time (maybe soon to be three-time?) MVP dropped a second-and-15 pass in the tiniest of windows to Mark Andrews, who made a tremendous sliding reception for 30 yards. That throw put Baltimore in the red zone, and Jackson then found a wide-open Rashod Bateman for the 7-yard touchdown just two plays later to blow the game open and the Browns were never able to cut it to single digits after that. You may look at this and think it's a rather run-of-the-mill touchdown pass from Lamar Jackson to Mark Andrews, but this toss made some tremendous NFL history. That throw crossed Jackson over the 4,000-passing yard threshold on the season. This makes him the first player in NFL history to have at least 4,000 passing yards and 800 rushing yards in a single season. Jackson is also the first player in NFL history to have 40 passing touchdowns and 800 yards rushing in a season. That's quite the exclamation point on Jackson's MVP argument. Speaking of the MVP award, Jackson is the first reigning NFL MVP to throw for 40 touchdowns the following season. From here, the Ravens will stick around M&T Bank Stadium as the No. 3 seed and gear up for the opening round of the playoffs. They'll also wait to see how the rest of the Week 18 slate unfolds to see who they'll host on Super Wild Card Weekend. As for the Browns, they'll be scoreboard-watching on Sunday as well. This loss locked them into a top-three pick at the 2025 NFL Draft, but wins by both the Patriots and Titans on Sunday would shoot them up to the No. 1 overall pick. As the clock hits zeros, the Baltimore Ravens clinch the AFC North and will be the No. 3 seed in the conference. Meanwhile, the Browns have clinched a top-three pick at the 2025 NFL Draft. And we have ourselves a big man interception! Defensive tackle Michael Pierce picks off Bailey Zappe! And there's your exclamation point! Derrick Henry lays the hammer down with a 43-yard touchdown run. I'm pretty surprised the Ravens still have their starters out there at this point, if we're being honest. It's an 18-point lead with under five minutes to go. The birthday boy gets into the end zone. Derrick Henry barrels in for a 2-yard touchdown to help make it a 28-10 lead for Baltimore with just under seven minutes to play in regulation. Bateman is having himself a day. He's up to 76 yards on five catches to go with a touchdown to begin the second half. As we noted, Lamar Jackson, Derrick Henry and Co. come back onto the field for this drive. That touchdown was the first for the Browns in the last 25 offensive drives. Another wrinkle to that score to make it an 11-point game is that the Ravens will likely keep their starters on the field. The Cleveland Browns are in the end zone. Bailey Zappe finds Jordan Akins for a 16-yard touchdown. Those Ravens -20 bettors are likely sweating quite a bit right now. Upon review, the call is reversed. It's an incomplete pass. This might be too close to reverse, but I did think that the ball was knocked free before that third foot was down. The Ravens biggest opponent tonight has mostly been themselves. They've been called for nine penalties for 78 yards. On his sixth target of the day, Jerry Jeudy records his first reception. That's a great well-timed hit by Humphrey to knock the ball out of Jerry Jeudy's hands. Jeudy is without a catch currently. With the Ravens inching closer to locking up the AFC North and No. 3 seed, it's worth noting that they could either play the Pittsburgh Steelers or the Los Angeles Chargers. Some would say it's a \"slow\" day for Derrick Henry, but that 20-plus yard rush now has him averaging 5.7 yards per carry. The Baltimore Ravens need to be careful here. Now it's Kyle Hamilton who is down on the field. John Harbaugh may soon consider resting some key players with a 21-3 lead. Rashod Bateman was WIDE open on that touchdown. That's No. 41 for Lamar Jackson through the air this season. That's such a tiny window for Lamar Jackson to fit that ball into and a remarkable sliding catch by Mark Andrews. This duo has heated up over the second half of the season and will be a force in the playoffs. Per CBS Research, Derrick Henry is the fourth player in NFL history with 1,800+ rush yards in multiple seasons. The cart is coming out for Hall, who is being put in an air cast. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

                "title": "Cincinnati Bengals vs. Pittsburgh Steelers Live Score and Stats - January 4, 2025 Gametracker - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. PITTSBURGH (AP) Joe Burrow will head to Cincinnati's training facility on Sunday. He'll lift weights. He might watch some video. And then he'll join the rest of his teammates and hope. It's not much. But it's the only thing left for Burrow and a Bengals team that certainly looks playoff-worthy everywhere but the standings after a 19-17 victory at Pittsburgh late Saturday night kept Cincinnati's slim postseason hopes flickering into the season's final day. “It's not ideal,” Burrow said after throwing for 277 yards and a touchdown. “But we put ourselves in this position.” In multiple ways. The Bengals were floundering at 4-8 a month ago, with seven of the losses coming by eight points or less. They responded by ripping off five straight to wrap up the regular season, including a win over the reeling Steelers. For the Bengals to grab the final playoff spot in the AFC, they need Patrick Mahomes-less Kansas City to beat Denver and the New York Jets to summon the energy at the end of a chaotic season to topple Miami. Yeah, it'll be weird rooting for the Chiefs. It beats having nothing to root for at all, which is certainly where Cincinnati seemed headed a month ago. “I don't know how many guys will be playing for (Kansas City),\" Burrow said with a small laugh. “Hopefully some.” While Burrow threw an interception and had his NFL-record streak of consecutive games with at least 250 yards passing and three touchdowns come to an end, he did enough to send the Steelers (10-7) reeling into the playoffs with a four-game losing streak. Pittsburgh will be the fifth seed and travel to AFC South champion Houston if the Los Angeles Chargers lose at Las Vegas. If the Chargers win, the Steelers will be the sixth seed and visit AFC North rival Baltimore next weekend. “We’re in a single-elimination tournament now, so we better turn our attention toward playing good football and better than we have particularly in recent weeks,” Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin said. If Tomlin wants a lesson on how to get it together under challenging circumstances, Cincinnati's play over the last month has provided it. The Bengals’ late run began after a 44-38 loss to the Steelers on Dec. 1 dropped them to 4-8. They haven’t lost since, with Burrow playing at an MVP level and their once porous defense playing its best football of the season. Burrow completed 37 of 46 passes, including a 12-yard touchdown to Ja'Marr Chase on Cincinnati's first possession that gave the Bengals a lead they never gave up. Chase finished with 10 receptions for 96 yards to put the NFL's “Triple Crown” for receivers (catches, yards and touchdowns) within reach. Cincinnati held reeling Pittsburgh (10-7) to 193 yards - more than 300 less than the 520 the Steelers rolled up in the first meeting - and turned aside a late rally. Trey Hendrickson sacked Russell Wilson 3 1/2 times to boost his season total to an NFL-leading 17 1/2 on a night the Bengals never let the playoff-bound Steelers get on track. “Obviously, our season hasn't gone the way we wanted, but we like how we closed out to get over .500 and give ourselves a chance,” Cincinnati cornerback Mike Hilton said. Wilson passed for 148 yards and a touchdown, both the score and the vast majority of the yards coming during the fourth quarter when the Steelers were desperately playing catchup. Wilson hit Pat Freiermuth for a 19-yard touchdown pass and Chris Boswell hit a 54-yard field goal to get Pittsburgh within two. The Steelers got the ball back just after the 2-minute warning but never made it to Cincinnati territory. Wilson threw incomplete to Freiermuth on fourth down and Burrow came out for a kneeldown that extended the Bengals' season to the final day. Whether Burrow and his teammates head to work on Monday to prepare for a trip to Buffalo or to clean out their lockers and turn their attention to what could be an eventful offseason is uncertain. Considering where his team was a month ago, Burrow will take it. “I know that if we get in, we can make some noise with the players and coaches that we have in this building,” he said. “We've just got to hope for some help tomorrow and sit back and watch it.” Bengals: Burrow was tended to by trainers on the field after taking a sack in the third quarter. He was evaluated in the medical tent for a concussion but did not miss an offense snap. ... WR Tee Higgins exited with a left ankle injury in the second half and did not return to what could be his final game with Cincinnati. ... Guard Cody Ford sustained a chest injury in the third quarter but stayed in the game. Steelers: Running back Najee Harris exited in the fourth quarter with a head injury following a 12-yard reception but was on the field for Pittsburgh's final drive. Bengals: Hope for some help on Sunday. Steelers: At either Houston or Baltimore next week. --- AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl Copyright 2025 STATS LLC and Associated Press.

The division was already decided by the time this game kicked off, but with playoff fates still on the line, that didn't stop either team from fighting for all four quarters. While all 17 games are important to every NFL team, this game took on extra significance for the Bengals. They've been clinging to their playoff hopes for numerous weeks and needed a win in this one to keep their dream alive. In a game highlighted by offensive shortcomings and a handful of key defensive plays, Cincinnati will live to see another day following a 19-17 victory over Pittsburgh. With the last Sunday slate of the NFL regular season set to kick off, everyone in Cincinnati now becomes Chiefs and Jets fans for the day in hopes that they'll be able to sneak into the AFC's No. 7 seed. Joe Burrow (37-of-46, 277 yards, TD, INT) didn't put up his usual gaudy numbers, but he did just enough with Ja'Marr Chase (10-96-1) to overcome for the loss Tee Higgins (ankle) in the second half. Trey Hendrickson wreaked havoc on the defensive end, racking up 3.5 sacks to maintain the NFL lead with 17.5. On the other side of the ball, this marked the fourth game in a disheartening losing streak for the Steelers. After recording just 193 yards of offense, it's clear that Pittsburgh will need to make some changes on offense as the playoffs approach. Russell Wilson (17-of-31, 148 yards, TD) led a late rally that saw Pittsburgh score the game's final 10 points, but a potential game-winning drive came up short after a turnover on downs in the final minute. George Pickens had a particularly tough night, catching just 1-of-6 targets for no yards while dropping several key passes. The Steelers are likely ticketed for a first-round matchup with the AFC North champion Ravens, though a Raiders' upset of the Chargers would send them to Houston instead of Baltimore. The game may be over, but The Sporting News tracked all of the key plays and moments from this divisional nail-biter. Check out the highlights that you may have missed from this one. SN's NFL HQ: Live NFL scores | Updated NFL standings | Full NFL schedule (All times Eastern) 11:09 p.m. TURNOVER ON DOWNS— With the game on the line, Wilson goes to his trusty tight end, Pat Friermuth. The pass slips through his hands and the Bengals take over on downs. Joe Burrow takes a knee and the Bengals have now won five straight games. 11:07 p.m. — Pittsburgh has to get the ball moving downfield to set up for a field goal. Pickens is open downfield but Wilson can't connect with him, bringing up 4th down. 11:06 p.m. — Trey Hendrickson is unconscious! He sacks Russell Wilson for his 3.5 sack on the night and bring up 3rd & 12. Pittsburgh is forced to use their final timeout on the play. 11:04 p.m. — Pittsburgh is down two and they need to get into field goal range with less than two minutes remaining. Wilson hooks up with Pat Friermuth for a 17-yard gain to get the ball to the Pittsburgh 42. 11:00 p.m. — The Pittsburgh defense comes up big on what may have been the most important play of the game! Keeanu Benton recorded his first sack of the season with a shoe-string tackle on Burrow as he tried to escape the pocket. Keeanu Benton's first sack of the season is a BIG one for the @Steelers! They force the punt down two with two minutes to go 👀📺: #CINvsPIT on ESPN/ABC📱: Stream on #NFLPlus and ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/0AHKxgstAc 10:59 p.m. — With just a couple of first downs needed to close out the game, the Bengals turned to their No. 1 receiver, Ja'Marr Chase on a quick screen. He was able to pick up a handful of yards to bring up 3rd & 3. 10:56 p.m. FIELD GOAL — Following a holding penalty, the Steelers were backed up into the outskirts of field goal range. The 54-yard kick was no problem for Pro Bowl kicker Chris Boswell, who drilled the kick with plenty of distance to spare. 10:54 p.m. — Trey Hendrickson has taken down Russell Wilson yet again! He records his second sack of the game to force Pittsburgh into third and long. 10:52 p.m. FUMBLE — The Steelers get the break they needed! The punt bounces of DJ Ivey's foot and Pittsburgh is able to recover the ricochet. Pittsburgh takes over on the Cincinnati 38-yard line. Chaos happening! 😱 pic.twitter.com/ddHXnBpW2q 10:50 p.m. — It's quickly third down for the Steelers. Wilson is looking for Pickens, but Cam Taylor-Britt has him blanketed. With the ball deep in their own territory, Pittsburgh will have to punt. 10:47 p.m. — Burrow finds Gesicki once again on third down, but it's short of the sticks. The completion brings up 4th & 6 and the punting unit takes the field. Calvin Austin cleanly fields the punt and Russell Wilson is back on the field. 10:44 p.m. — After a batted pass on first down, Burrow silences the crowd in Pittsburgh with a nice play. He steps up in the pocket and finds Mike Gesicki (of course) to give the Bengals a first down. 10:41 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — Cincinnati has a breakdown in the secondary and leave Pat Friermuth wide open. Wilson hits the open man and Friermuth strolls in for the touchdown. We've got a one-score game in Pittsburgh! Wilson to Freiermuth for six! The @Steelers cut it to a one-score game.📺: #CINvsPIT on ESPN/ABC📱: Stream on #NFLPlus and ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/UzcZkx6XnQ 10:40 p.m. — Russell Wilson has the crowd fired up for the first time in the second half. After bobbling the snap, he runs up the middle for a 12-yard game. 10:36 p.m. — Najee Harris just made a big man play, shedding several tackles and carrying multiple defenders for a gritty 12 yards. Unfortunately, he was shaken up on the play and is in the medical tent. 10:34 p.m. — With the clock dwindling, Russell Wilson is finally starting to find his groove. He's hooked up with Van Jefferson for three quick passes to send Pittsburgh into Cincinnati territory. 10:29 p.m. FIELD GOAL — Neither offense has been able to meet expectations tonight. For the Bengals, their struggles have come in the red zone. After missing Mike Gesicki on 3rd & Goal, Cade York lined up for another short field goal. His 23-yard kick extends Cincinnati's lead to 12 points. 10:27 p.m. — Joe Burrow put his elite pocket presence on display yet again. He perfectly navigated the pass rush to find Tanner Hudson for a first down. Burrow stays calm and finds the open man for the first down.📺: #CINvsPIT on ESPN/ABC📱: Stream on #NFLPlus and ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/kJb5ZsevCk 10:25 p.m. — Tee Higgins left the field with an ankle injury a few plays ago. He has not yet returned to the field and is officially \"questionable\". Ideally, the Bengals will be able to lean on Chase and the ground game to close out this game. 10:23 p.m. — The Bengals' drive rolls on following a phenomenal sideline snag from Ja'Marr Chase. That was a vintage Burrow-Chase play right there. Burrow. Chase. Back shoulder. Too good.📺: #CINvsPIT on ESPN/ABC📱: Stream on #NFLPlus and ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/ccXIzcL35I 10:16 p.m. — Khalil Herbert picks up a first down after two consecutive carries to open the drive. As the offense gets moving, the Bengals are certainly thinking about finding the endzone to build their lead to three scores. 10:12 p.m. — Arthur Smith understands that he needs to get the downfield passing game going in the second half and he dials up a shot to George Pickens which is unfortunately broken up by DJ Ivey. The Steelers punt it to the Bengals and Burrow is back on the field for Cincinnati's ensuing drive. 10:10 p.m. — Pittsburgh is starting to find some rhythm on offense, sparked by a couple of nice carries from Jaylen Warren and Najee Harris. They'll have to get the passing attack going as well to threaten the Cincinnati secondary. 10:06 p.m. FIELD GOAL — Another Cincinnati drive stalls out in the red zone. Cade York hits his third field goal of the night, this one from 35 yards. 10:03 p.m. — It's 3rd & 2 for Cincinnati and Burrow is doing his best Houdini impression. He dodges a few defenders before being swallowed up by the Pittsburgh pass rush. It's Nick Herbig on the sack to force 4th down. Burrow landed on the football and was banged up on the play; this will be something to keep an eye on. He's since entered the blue medical tent. 10:01 p.m. — The Bengals' first drive of the second half is eerily similar to what we saw on their opening drive of the game. A couple of nice gains from Ja'Marr Chase and Khalil Herbert have the Bengals inside the 10-yard line. 9:57 p.m. — As we've seen throughout the night, Tee Higgins and Mike Gesicki are picking up first downs for Cincinnati. The Bengals are already within field goal range after just a couple of plays. 9:53 p.m. — Najee Harris gets two touches to start the drive for just two yards across both plays. It's third down once again and Calvin Austin shakes free on his route. Russell Wilson can't quite put the ball on target and the pass goes incomplete. It's Pittsburgh's third three-and-out of the night. 9:51 p.m. — Cade York kicks off for a touchback to get the second half started. The Pittsburgh offense takes the field and they'll look to find their footing on their opening drive of the half. 9:35 p.m. FIELD GOAL — After an uncharacteristic drop for Ja'Marr Chase, Cade York knocks in a 27-yard field goal with 16 seconds remaining in the first half. 9:34 p.m. — The Bengals can't get anything going in this goal-to-go situation. Burrow throws a perfectly-placed ball to Ja'Marr Chase on 3rd & Goal but it goes in and out of his hands to end their hopes of finding the endzone. 9:31 p.m. — After a couple of quick hitters to start the drive, Burrow finds Tee Higgins for a spectacular completion. Higgins high-points the ball and comes down with it to set up the Bengals on the Pittsburgh nine-yard line. Burrow to Higgins for 18 yards!📺: #CINvsPIT on ESPN/ABC📱: Stream on #NFLPlus and ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/OuxB3YD68w 9:28 p.m. TURNOVER ON DOWNS — Pittsburgh actually snaps the ball on 4th down! They hand the ball off to Jaylen Warren and he's blown up behind the first down line. Cincinnati takes over on the Pittsburgh 37 and will have an opportunity to score before the half is over. 9:25 p.m. — After a nine-yard gain from Friermuth on second down, Pittsburgh opts to go with a Russell Wilson QB sneak to pick up the first down. Originally called a first down, the officials reviewed the spot and ruled him short. It's 4th & 1 on the Pittsburgh 38 and they're lined up to go for it! 9:21 p.m. — Pat Friermuth has the Pittsburgh offense humming. Gains of 11 and 9 yards have the Steelers moving in the two minute drill. They'll be looking for a field goal to close out the half and tie up the game. 9:16 p.m. INTERCEPTION — Burrow's looking for his go-to guy, Ja'Marr Chase on second down. The pass ping-pongs off Chase and Patrick Queen, ultimately landing in the waiting hands of Beanie Bishop! PICK. Beanie Bishop Jr. comes down with the @steelers interception!📺: #CINvsPIT on ESPN/ABC📱: Stream on #NFLPlus and ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/cmw1cNspYZ 9:13 p.m. — Another week and another strip sack for T.J. Watt. He makes his way to Burrow in the backfield and is able to knock the ball out of his hands. Unfortunately, the play is negated by a defensive holding downfield; it's an automatic first down for Cincinnati to keep the drive alive. 9:07 p.m. FUMBLE — Calvin Austin fields Ryan Rekhow's punt but coughs up the ball on the return! Cincinnati recovers and immediately takes over deep in Pittsburgh territory. This could be one of the big turning points of the game. FUMBLE. The @Bengals recover the ball on the punt return!📺: #CINvsPIT on ESPN/ABC📱: Stream on #NFLPlus and ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/WnRoWUUw9Y 9:06 p.m. — Burrow is brought down for a sack on third down! Preston Smith blows by Cordell Volson and gets to the quarterback to force a stop for the Steelers. 9:05 p.m. — A penalty on center Ted Karras puts the Bengals off schedule on their first set of downs on the drive. They're able to recover and get to 3rd & 3 following a completion to Ja'Marr Chase. 8:59 p.m. — Pittsburgh's drive starts off with two carries for Jaylen Warren. He sets Pittsburgh up with a manageable 3rd & 3. Bengals' corner Josh Newton makes a strong play on the ball to break up Wilson's pass to force a punt. It's another three-and-out for Pittsburgh. 8:56 p.m. TURNOVER ON DOWNS — It's 4th & 1 and the Bengals are lined up to go for it. Burrow's pass is intended for Gesicki once again, but Cam Heyward tips it at the line! The Steelers get the stop they desperately need. 8:54 p.m. — Another Cincinnati drive gets going with a first down from Mike Gesicki. Burrow finds his tight end on a crossing route to convert on 2nd & 5 and Cincinnati is into Pittsburgh territory. 8:47 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — With the ball on the one, the Steelers turn to their battering ram, Najee Harris. He punches it in with ease to bring this to a one-score game. Pittsburgh is officially on the board! Najee Harris gets the @Steelers on the board!📺: #CINvsPIT on ESPN/ABC📱: Stream on #NFLPlus and ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/FxUtb5EQyg 8:46 p.m. — It's 3rd & Goal and Russell Wilson is looking for his big tight end Darnell Washington. The pass falls incomplete but there's another flag. It's a second PI call on Taylor-Britt and Pittsburgh has if 1st & Goal from the one-yard line. 8:45 p.m. — Pittsburgh converts on yet another third down. Russell Wilson takes a sneak for a first down and it's 1st & Goal for the Steelers. 8:42 p.m. — The Bengals force an incompletion on a crucial third down but there's a flag on the play. A pass interference call on Cam Taylor-Britt gives Pittsburgh a first down. 8:37 p.m. — On the final play of the first quarter, Wilson connects with Mike Williams on a patented Russell Wilson moon ball. The reception is good for 25 yards and Pittsburgh is threatening in Cincinnati territory. Hands + feet on point for @darealmike_dub pic.twitter.com/0CLugpYknb 8:35 p.m. — Najee Harris gets the Pittsburgh offense going with a hard-fought 10 yards on first down. He breaks a couple of tackles to get Pittsburgh their first fresh set of downs on the night. 8:31 p.m. FIELD GOAL — After a miscue on his first kickoff of the night, Cade York redeems himself by drilling a 48-yard field goal. 8:30 p.m. — Burrow is under siege on third down and can't find a receiver quick enough. Patrick Queen lands a hit on Burrow and the Bengals line up for a field goal. 8:28 p.m. — With a strong first-down run from Khalil Herbert, Cincinnati is putting together yet another strong drive. They're on the cusp of the red zone yet again. 8:26 p.m. — The Bengals are back on the field and they're still rolling. Burrow hooks up with Gesicki for a third time tonight to move the chains on third and short. 8:20 p.m. — Looking to answer the quick start from the Bengals, Russell Wilson and the Steelers can't get anything going on their opening series. Pittsburgh goes three-and-out, capped off by a sack from Trey Hendrickson, his 15th of the year. 8:14 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — Burrow finds Chase for an easy touchdown to cap off a surgical opening drive. Chase beats his man on the inside and it's pitch and catch for the long-time teammates.

He's connected with Mike Geiscki and Tee Higgins to complete each of his first three passes of the game for 37 yards. 8:09 p.m. — Cincinnati starts the game on the ground. Khalil Herbert gets stuffed for no gain in his first start in Bengals uniform. 8:07 p.m. — The Steelers have won the coin toss and deferred. Joe Burrow and the Bengals will take the field first. 7:54 p.m. — As kickoff approaches, the wind is whipping in Pittsburgh and the temperature is in the low 20s. Get ready for some January football between two teams in one of the NFL's grittiest divisions. 7:15 p.m. — In the midst of a three-game losing streak, the Steelers are looking to build some positive momentum heading into the playoffs. Russell Wilson and George Pickens finding their downfield connection against an attackable Cincinnati secondary will be critical for Pittsburgh to win this one. 6:44 p.m. — With Chase Brown sidelined, look for Joe Burrow to sling the ball all over the field on Saturday night. On the other side of the ball, Pittsburgh's stud pass rusher, T.J. Watt, will be doing his best to disrupt Burrow's rhythm and keep the Cincinnati passing attack in check. 6:13 p.m. — Chase Brown has been ruled out for Saturday's AFC North clash. Cincinnati will turn to former Chicago Bear, Khalil Herbert, at running back. Sources: #Bengals standout RB Chase Brown is OUT today vs the #Steelers.Brown went through a pregame workout, and as one source said: “He did everything he could all week to put himself in a position to play,” but it was too quick a turnaround after the high ankle sprain. pic.twitter.com/9mNNl4eole 5:58 p.m. — It's a chilly evening in Pittsburgh and players are beginning to take the field for pregame warmups. Bengals breakout running back, Chase Brown, was labeled a gametime decision, but things don't seem to be going well in warmups. Chase Brown just tried to do some cutting drills, shook his head no and is now walking off the field. Saturday's AFC North clash between the Bengals and Steelers will kick off from Acrisure Stadium in Pittsburgh at 8 p.m. ET. Bengals vs. Steelers will be broadcast on both ESPN and ABC on Saturday night. Additionally, the game will be streamed on ESPN+ and Fubo.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. PITTSBURGH (AP) Joe Burrow will head to Cincinnati's training facility on Sunday. He'll lift weights. He might watch some video. And then he'll join the rest of his teammates and hope. It's not much. But it's the only thing left for Burrow and a Bengals team that certainly looks playoff-worthy everywhere but the standings after a 19-17 victory at Pittsburgh late Saturday night kept Cincinnati's slim postseason hopes flickering into the season's final day. “It's not ideal,” Burrow said after throwing for 277 yards and a touchdown. “But we put ourselves in this position.” In multiple ways. The Bengals were floundering at 4-8 a month ago, with seven of the losses coming by eight points or less. They responded by ripping off five straight to wrap up the regular season, including a win over the reeling Steelers. For the Bengals to grab the final playoff spot in the AFC, they need Patrick Mahomes-less Kansas City to beat Denver and the New York Jets to summon the energy at the end of a chaotic season to topple Miami. Yeah, it'll be weird rooting for the Chiefs. It beats having nothing to root for at all, which is certainly where Cincinnati seemed headed a month ago. “I don't know how many guys will be playing for (Kansas City),\" Burrow said with a small laugh. “Hopefully some.” While Burrow threw an interception and had his NFL-record streak of consecutive games with at least 250 yards passing and three touchdowns come to an end, he did enough to send the Steelers (10-7) reeling into the playoffs with a four-game losing streak. Pittsburgh will be the fifth seed and travel to AFC South champion Houston if the Los Angeles Chargers lose at Las Vegas. If the Chargers win, the Steelers will be the sixth seed and visit AFC North rival Baltimore next weekend. “We’re in a single-elimination tournament now, so we better turn our attention toward playing good football and better than we have particularly in recent weeks,” Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin said. If Tomlin wants a lesson on how to get it together under challenging circumstances, Cincinnati's play over the last month has provided it. The Bengals’ late run began after a 44-38 loss to the Steelers on Dec. 1 dropped them to 4-8. They haven’t lost since, with Burrow playing at an MVP level and their once porous defense playing its best football of the season. Burrow completed 37 of 46 passes, including a 12-yard touchdown to Ja'Marr Chase on Cincinnati's first possession that gave the Bengals a lead they never gave up. Chase finished with 10 receptions for 96 yards to put the NFL's “Triple Crown” for receivers (catches, yards and touchdowns) within reach. Cincinnati held reeling Pittsburgh (10-7) to 193 yards - more than 300 less than the 520 the Steelers rolled up in the first meeting - and turned aside a late rally. Trey Hendrickson sacked Russell Wilson 3 1/2 times to boost his season total to an NFL-leading 17 1/2 on a night the Bengals never let the playoff-bound Steelers get on track. “Obviously, our season hasn't gone the way we wanted, but we like how we closed out to get over .500 and give ourselves a chance,” Cincinnati cornerback Mike Hilton said. Wilson passed for 148 yards and a touchdown, both the score and the vast majority of the yards coming during the fourth quarter when the Steelers were desperately playing catchup. Wilson hit Pat Freiermuth for a 19-yard touchdown pass and Chris Boswell hit a 54-yard field goal to get Pittsburgh within two. The Steelers got the ball back just after the 2-minute warning but never made it to Cincinnati territory. Wilson threw incomplete to Freiermuth on fourth down and Burrow came out for a kneeldown that extended the Bengals' season to the final day. Whether Burrow and his teammates head to work on Monday to prepare for a trip to Buffalo or to clean out their lockers and turn their attention to what could be an eventful offseason is uncertain. Considering where his team was a month ago, Burrow will take it. “I know that if we get in, we can make some noise with the players and coaches that we have in this building,” he said. “We've just got to hope for some help tomorrow and sit back and watch it.” Bengals: Burrow was tended to by trainers on the field after taking a sack in the third quarter. He was evaluated in the medical tent for a concussion but did not miss an offense snap. ... WR Tee Higgins exited with a left ankle injury in the second half and did not return to what could be his final game with Cincinnati. ... Guard Cody Ford sustained a chest injury in the third quarter but stayed in the game. Steelers: Running back Najee Harris exited in the fourth quarter with a head injury following a 12-yard reception but was on the field for Pittsburgh's final drive. Bengals: Hope for some help on Sunday. Steelers: At either Houston or Baltimore next week. --- AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl Copyright 2025 STATS LLC and Associated Press.

                "content": "The Cincinnati Bengals’ playoff hopes are still alive after narrowly defeating the Pittsburgh Steelers 19-17 on Saturday. Despite starting the season 4-8, the Bengals have closed on a five-game win streak and have a path to the postseason if the Denver Broncos lose to the Kansas City Chiefs and the Miami Dolphins lose to or tie the New York Jets on Sunday. Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow said it’s “not great” that their fate is in someone else’s hands, “but we put ourselves in this position. No one to blame but ourselves.\" \"We’ll enjoy this win and go and watch some football tomorrow and hope for the best,” Burrow added. Burrow completed 37 of 46 passes on Saturday for 277 yards, one touchdown and one interception. He was sacked four times for 31 yards, including one where he ended up in the blue tent. “I’ll be a little sore tomorrow, but I’ll be all good,” Burrow said. NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more. The Steelers have a streak of their own going, losing the last four games of the regular season. The Steelers had an opportunity to steal the game late, but TE Pat Freiermuth couldn't catch a fourth down pass that would have given Pittsburgh a first down. Freiermuth had a team-high eight receptions for 85 yards and one touchdown. Russell Wilson completed 17 of 31 passes for 148 yards and one touchdown. He was sacked four times, 3.5 of them coming from Bengals star Trey Hendrickson. Check out the highlights and top moments from the Bengals-Steelers clash on Saturday night below: Pittsburgh forced a three-and-out to give itself a chance to win, but its last-gasp drive came up empty. Russell Wilson was tackled in bounds on a run, then was sacked in a disastrous sequence that proved fatal to the Steelers' hopes of pulling off an improbable victory. The Steelers punted the ball away, but got it right back. The Bengals' D.J. Ivey inadvertently kicked the ball while trying to block on the punt return. It was recovered by Connor Heyward before going out of bounds. Chris Boswell went on to kick a 54-yard field goal to cut the Steelers’ deficit to 19-17 with 2:39 remaining. The Steelers running back is questionable to return with a possible head injury after a helmet-to-helmet hit. He was evaluated in the blue tent before heading back to the locker room. Harris exited the contest with 12 carries for 38 yards and three receptions for 22 yards. He did return, however, catching a pass on the Steelers' final drive. The Steelers have life. TE Pat Freiermuth caught a 19-yard touchdown pass with 8:07 remaining in the fourth quarter to cut the Bengals' lead to five points, 19-14. The touchdown was set up by Russell Wilson’s 12-yard scramble to get a first down at Cincinnati’s 31-yard line. Running back Najee Harris went down on the drive after what appeared to be a helmet-to-helmet hit. The Steelers said Harris was \"being evaluated for a possible head injury\" and was questionable to return. Bengals WR Ja'Marr Chase says he’s always open and he highlighted that on a 19-yard reception from Joe Burrow. Chase caught the pass over his back shoulder before turning and dragging his foot along the sideline. The Bengals' drive stalled, however, and they weren’t able to capitalize on another trip to the red zone. Cincinnati settled for a field goal to go up 19-7. Joe Burrow is out of the blue tent and back in the game. Burrow was evaluated for a concussion after he was driven to the ground on a sack, but he was cleared to return without missing a drive. WR Tee Higgins, however, was deemed questionable to return with an ankle injury. The Steelers punted yet again after a costly drop. Facing third-and-8 on their own 44-yard line, Russell Wilson targeted George Pickens for the second time on Saturday with a deep ball along the sidelines that would have given the Steelers a first down. Pickens beat his defender, but dropped the ball. Pickens only has one reception for no yards on the night. The Steelers' defense stepped up again. On third-and-2 at Pittsburgh’s 5-yard line, Joe Burrow was sacked for a loss of 12 yards by Nick Herbig and Cameron Heyward, who both landed on top of Burrow. The Bengals QB landed face down and remained down on the field with pieces of turf stuck in his face guard. Burrow was able to walk off the field under his own power and immediately went to the blue tent for evaluation. No penalty flag was thrown for roughing the passer. The Bengals settled for a 35-yard field goal try, which Cade York knocked through to push Cincinnati's lead to 16-7. Burrow exited the tent and remained on the sideline and was back in the game for the Bengals' next series. The Bengals have a slight lead heading into halftime, up 13-7 over Pittsburgh through two quarters. The Steelers' defense has kept the score close, but their offense must get going if they want to snap their three-game losing streak. Pittsburgh only recorded 75 total yards in the first half, 48 of those yards coming on the ground. QB Russell Wilson completed four of eight passes for 45 yards. He was sacked two times for 18 yards. Bengals QB Joe Burrow completed 21 of 27 passes for 153 yards, one touchdown and one interception. WR Ja’Marr Chase has five receptions for 41 yards and one touchdown. The Bengals extended their lead over the Steelers to six points with a 27-yard field goal with 16 seconds remaining in the first half. Cincinnati received the ball at Pittsburgh’s 37-yard line and made it to the red zone, but the Bengals were unable to score after Joe Burrow threw three straight incompletions. The Steelers turned the ball over on downs at their own 37-yard line with 49 seconds left in the first half after they failed to pick up 1 yard on two consecutive plays. Russell Wilson’s quarterback sneak came up short on third-and-1 and running back Jaylen Warren wasn’t able to move the chains on fourth-and-1. The Bengals looked like they were going to put more points on the board heading into halftime, but the Steelers forced a turnover. Joe Burrow’s pass intended for Ja'Marr Chase was deflected and bobbled in the air by Steelers LB Patrick Queen. Beanie Bishop Jr. completed the interception at Pittsburgh’s 17-yard-line. The Bengals started their possession behind the sticks after being called for an ineligible man downfield and Cincinnati wasn’t able to recover. Steelers LB Preston Smith sacked Bengals QB Joe Burrow on third down at Cincinnati's 19-yard line, leading to a punt. Cincinnati, however, was able to get the ball right back. The Steelers’ Calvin Austin III fumbled on the punt return after Bengals LB Shaka Heyward appeared to punch the ball out. Cincinnati recovered the fumble on Pittsburgh’s 33-yard line. Instead of settling for another field goal, the Bengals went for it on fourth-and-1 at Pittsburgh’s 37-yard line. Enter Cameron Heyward. The Steelers' 35-year-old defensive tackle tipped Joe Burrow’s pass, resulting in a turnover on downs. The Steelers cashed in on their trip to the red zone and they had help along the way. QB Russell Wilson kept Pittsburgh’s drive alive with a 25-yard completion to WR Mike Williams, who showcased his twinkle-toes along the sidelines on third-and-long to get into Cincinnati territory. A pass interference penalty was called on Bengals CB Cam Taylor-Britt for impeding TE Pat Freiermuth, setting up the Steelers at the Bengals’ 29-yard line. Taylor-Britt was called for pass interference again on TE Darnell Washington in the end zone, putting the Steelers at the Bengals’ 1-yard line. RB Najee Harris punched it in for a 1-yard touchdown. The Steelers' defense held the Bengals to a field goal. Facing third-and-6 on Pittsburgh’s 26-yard line, Bengals QB Joe Burrow was sacked by LB Patrick Queen and fumbled the ball. It was recovered by Cincinnati and the Bengals settled for a 48-yard field goal to extend their lead to 10 points. The Steelers had no response to the Bengals’ opening touchdown. Despite starting on its own 40-yard line, Pittsburgh went three-and-out on its first drive. QB Russell Wilson was sacked by Bengals DE Trey Hendrickson on third-and-7 for a 9-yard loss. It marked Hendrickson’s 15th sack of the season, the most in the league. The Bengals are off to a red-hot start, despite the frigid temperatures. QB Joe Burrow completed six of six passes on the Bengals’ nine-play, 73-yard opening touchdown drive. Three of those receptions went to WR Ja'Marr Chase, including a 12-yard touchdown pass right up the middle to give the Bengals a 7-0 lead over the Steelers. Bengals TE Mike Gesicki is $125,000 richer. He entered Saturday’s matchup against the Steelers needing 3 receiving yards to reach 600 on the season to trigger a six-digit incentive. It didn’t take long. Gesicki caught a 12-yard pass from QB Joe Burrow on the Bengals’ opening drive to collect the extra money. He can pick up another $125,000 if he gets two touchdown grabs. The Bengals still are a long shot to reach the playoffs. Cincinnati first must win its matchup against the Steelers on Saturday in Pittsburgh. The Bengals will then need some help the rest of the way. They need the Denver Broncos to lose to the Kansas City Chiefs and the Miami Dolphins to lose or tie the New York Jets on Sunday. The Baltimore Ravens clinched the AFC North and the No. 3 seed Saturday with a 35-10 win over the Cleveland Browns. Ravens QB Lamar Jackson completed 16 of 32 passes for 217 yards and two touchdowns, in addition to nine carries for 63 yards. Running back Derrick Henry celebrated his 31st birthday with 20 carries for 138 yards and two touchdowns. The win wasn’t without any difficulties. Receiver Zay Flowers went down clutching his knee in the first half and was ruled out the remainder of the game. His status for the playoffs is not clear. The Steelers will be the No. 5 seed, facing the AFC South champion Houston Texans, if they beat the Bengals Saturday night. If the Steelers lose to the Bengals, they could slip to the No. 6 seed — where they would face the Ravens — if the Chargers win Sunday. Pickens’ wallet got a little lighter after Christmas and it had nothing to do with shopping. Pickens was fined $10,231 for unsportsmanlike conduct in the Steelers’ 29-10 Christmas Day loss to the Kansas City Chiefs for removing his helmet. Pickens was called for a false start on a fourth-down attempt, resulting in him putting his hands to his head and removing his helmet in frustration on the field. Donte Jackson came into Saturday listed as questionable, but he won’t suit up against the Cincinnati Bengals due to a back injury. Jackson landed on the Steelers’ inactive list, alongside WR Scott Miller, DE Isaiahh Loudermilk, DE Dean Lowry and QB Kyle Allen. It’s do or die for the Bengals and they will be down their starting running back. Chase Brown was listed as inactive vs. the Steelers on Saturday due to an ankle injury. It’s a big blow for the Bengals. Brown has recorded 990 rushing yards and seven touchdowns on the ground, in addition to 360 receiving yards and four touchdowns in 16 games this season. WR Charlie Jones, DE Isaiah Thomas, OT Andrew Stueber, WR Jermaine Burton, TE Tanner McLachlan and DE Sam Hubbard are also on the Bengals’ inactive list. Stakes are high for the Pittsburgh Steelers and Cincinnati Bengals in their matchup on Saturday, but temperatures at Acrisure Stadium will be very low. According to The Weather Channel, the temperature in Pittsburgh is expected to drop to 21 degrees at kickoff at 8:00 p.m. ET. Fans and players not only have to brave the cold, they also have to withstand 10 mph winds that will increase to 12 mph throughout the contest. The frigid forecast states that it will feel like 10 degrees in Pittsburgh. The Steelers and Bengals are set to kick off at 8 p.m. ET on Saturday night. ABC and ESPN will simulcast the Steelers-Bengals matchup on Saturday night. Chris Fowler (play-by-play) will be flanked by Louis Riddick and Dan Orlovsky in the broadcast booth. Here's how the USA TODAY Sports staff feels the matchup between the Bengals and Steelers will go: Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Jermaine Burton is facing an eviction notice from his apartment, according to court documents. Burton, a rookie out of Alabama, also did not travel with the team for Saturday's night game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, head coach Zac Taylor said. Taylor said it was his decision to leave his third-round draft pick behind, but did not comment on the reason for the choice. — Cameron Knight, Cincinnati Enquirer The USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news — fast.

He was 47. His death was confirmed by a representative, who did not cite a cause. The Los Angeles police responded on Friday morning to a death investigation at an address that matched records for Mr. Baena. The Los Angeles County medical examiner’s office later said that Mr. Baena had died by suicide. Mr. Baena often elevated dark thematic elements with humor in his works. There were zombies and romance in “Life After Beth” (2014), and improper nuns in “The Little Hours” (2017). He was married to the actress Aubrey Plaza, who played the titular character in “Life After Beth,” about a woman who comes back from the dead after a fatal snake bite, and acted in “The Little Hours,” and “Spin Me Round” (2022), which Mr. Baena directed and co-wrote with the actress Alison Brie. Mr. Baena also co-wrote the 2004 film “I Heart Huckabees,” a dark comedy that stars Dustin Hoffman, Jude Law, Jason Schwartzman, Lily Tomlin and Mark Wahlberg. The film, about an environmentalist who hires “existential detectives,” was not a box office success but developed a cult following for its quirky plotlines and characters. “My parents were divorced, so I’m sure the trauma of divorce helped inform my sense of humor,” Mr. Baena said in an interview on Fresh Fiction, a YouTube channel, in 2022. “Most comedy probably comes from drama.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

                "content": "Jeffrey Baena (June 29, 1977 – January 3, 2025) was an American screenwriter and film director. He wrote and directed Life After Beth (2014), Joshy (2016), The Little Hours (2017), Horse Girl (2020), and Spin Me Round (2022), and co-wrote I Heart Huckabees (2004). He was known for his frequent collaborations with actresses Alison Brie, with whom he co-wrote Horse Girl and Spin Me Round, Molly Shannon, and his wife, Aubrey Plaza. Baena was born on June 29, 1977,[2] and grew up in a secular Jewish family in Miami.[3][4] He graduated from the New York University Tisch School of the Arts with a degree in film and moved to Los Angeles to pursue directing.[1] Baena became a production assistant for filmmaker Robert Zemeckis on What Lies Beneath and Cast Away (both 2000).[5][6] After working with Zemeckis, Baena became an assistant editor for writer-director David O. Russell. After a year and a half of working together, a minor car accident injured one of Baena's eyes. Partially to keep his spirits up and pass the time during his recovery, Russell began discussing story ideas with Baena. The two ended up collaborating on four scripts together, including I Heart Huckabees, which Russell directed in 2004, and Jay Roach's Meet the Fockers (also 2004), for which they made uncredited revisions.[5][7]: 146–147 Baena had planned for the comedy-drama Joshy to be his directorial debut, but actor and collaborator Adam Pally had to postpone due to personal reasons. He then decided to work on the zombie comedy Life After Beth, from a script he started writing in 2003.[8] His directorial debut, the film starred Aubrey Plaza and premiered at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival.[9][10] Baena returned to direct Joshy, which premiered at Sundance in 2016 to positive reviews.[5] The film's Rotten Tomatoes critics' consensus highlights Baena's direction for \"strik[ing] a unique, disarmingly heartfelt blend of dark humor and tragedy\".[11] His next film was the 2017 dark comedy The Little Hours, featuring actors Alison Brie, Dave Franco, Kate Micucci, Plaza, John C. Reilly, and Molly Shannon.[12] He would direct Brie two more times in the films Horse Girl (2020) and Spin Me Round (2022), which they co-wrote together. The latter also featured Plaza.[13][14] Baena had been in a relationship with actress Aubrey Plaza since 2011. In 2021, on their tenth anniversary of being together, they were married in a small ceremony in their backyard.[15] On January 3, 2025, Baena's body was discovered at his home in Los Angeles by his assistant, and he was pronounced dead at the scene. Baena was 47.[16] The Los Angeles County medical examiner reported the cause of death as suicide by hanging.[17][18] Film Television",

His body was discovered by an assistant at his Los Angeles home on Friday morning, where he was later pronounced dead, media reports say. The American director, best known for films The Little Hours, Life After Beth and Joshy, married Ms Plaza in 2021. The family told Deadline they were \"devastated\" and asked for privacy at this difficult time. Ms Plaza, 40, star of TV series The White Lotus and Parks and Recreation, has not yet commented publicly on the death of her husband. The circumstances of his death remain unclear. Mr Baena graduated from New York University with a degree in film before moving to LA to pursue directing. He worked in production under filmmakers Robert Zemeckis and David O'Russell, before breaking away to make his own films. He made his directorial debut in 2014 with the release of the zombie comedy film Life After Beth, which featured Plaza. The pair would go on to collaborate on several projects.

Law enforcement sources confirmed to TMZ that Baena’s body was discovered by an assistant at a Los Angeles-area home on Friday, January 3. The Los Angeles Medical Examiner has since ruled his death a suicide by hanging. Celebrated for his offbeat and thought-provoking storytelling, Baena co-wrote David O. Russell’s I Heart Huckabees in 2004 and directed five feature films, four of which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. His directorial debut, the 2014 zombie comedy Life After Beth, starred Plaza and marked the beginning of their creative partnership. The Miami native, son of a teacher and attorney, found his passion for film after watching Stanley Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange and Federico Fellini’s 8 1/2 as a child. In a 2017 interview with Marc Maron, he shared, “I was always drawn to left-of-center things.” Baena’s other works include Joshy (2016), The Little Hours (2017), Horse Girl (2020), and Spin Me Round (2022). His collaborations with Plaza, who appeared in four of his films, were a source of deep fulfillment for the couple. “The opportunities to create together... how rare is that? She’s so talented, so I’m really lucky,” Baena reflected in a 2021 interview. The couple, who married in 2021, had been together for over a decade. Plaza, known for her Emmy-nominated role in The White Lotus, survives Baena along with his parents, stepparents, brother, and stepsiblings.

        "Premier League": [
            {
                "title": "Premier League - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Premier League is a professional association football league in England and the highest level of the English football league system. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League (EFL). Seasons usually run from August to May, with each team playing 38 matches: two against each other team, one home and one away.[1] Most games are played on weekend afternoons, with occasional weekday evening fixtures.[2] The competition was founded as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992, following the decision of First Division (the top-tier league from 1888 until 1992) clubs to break away from the English Football League. However, teams may still be relegated to and promoted from the EFL Championship. The Premier League is a corporation managed by a chief executive, with member clubs acting as shareholders.[3] The Premier League takes advantage of a £5 billion television rights deal, with Sky and BT Group securing the domestic rights to broadcast 128 and 32 games, respectively.[4][5] This deal will rise to £6.7 billion for the four seasons from 2025 to 2029.[6] The league is projected to earn $7.2 billion in overseas TV rights from 2022 to 2025.[7] Clubs were apportioned central payment revenues of £2.4 billion in 2016–17, with a further £343 million in solidarity payments to EFL clubs.[8] The Premier League is the most-watched sports league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes, with a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people.[9][10] For the 2023–24 season, the average Premier League match attendance was 38,375,[11] second to the German Bundesliga's 39,512,[12] whilst aggregated attendance across all matches in a 38-game season is the highest of any association football league.[13] Most stadium occupancies are near capacity.[14] As of 2023[update], the Premier League is ranked first in the UEFA coefficient rankings based on performances in European competitions over the past five seasons, ahead of Spain's La Liga.[15] The English top-flight has produced the second-highest number of European Cup / UEFA Champions League titles, with a record six English clubs having won fifteen European championships in total.[16] Fifty-one clubs have competed in the Premier League since its inception in 1992: 49 from England and 2 from Wales. Seven of them have won the title: Manchester United (13), Manchester City (8), Chelsea (5), Arsenal (3), Blackburn Rovers (1), Leicester City (1), and Liverpool (1).[17] Only six clubs have played in every season to date: Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United, and Tottenham Hotspur.[18] Despite significant European success in the 1970s and early 1980s, the late 1980s marked a low point for English football. Stadiums were deteriorating, supporters endured poor facilities, hooliganism was rife, and English clubs had been banned from European competition for five years following the Heysel Stadium disaster between the fans of Liverpool Football Club and the fans of Juventus in 1985.[19] The Football League First Division, the top level of English football since 1888, was behind leagues such as Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga in attendance and revenues, and several top English players had moved abroad.[20] By the turn of the 1990s, the downward trend was starting to reverse. At the 1990 FIFA World Cup, England reached the semi-finals; UEFA, European football's governing body, lifted the five-year ban on English clubs playing in European competitions in 1990, resulting in Manchester United lifting the Cup Winners' Cup in 1991. The Taylor Report on stadium safety standards, which proposed expensive upgrades to create all-seater stadiums in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster; between the fans of Liverpool and the fans of Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield, Yorkshire on 15 April 1989, was published in January 1990.[21] During the 1980s, major English clubs began to transform into business ventures, applying commercial principles to club administration to maximise revenue. Martin Edwards of Manchester United, Irving Scholar of Tottenham Hotspur, and David Dein of Arsenal were among the leaders in this transformation.[22] The commercial imperative led to the top clubs seeking to increase their power and revenue: the clubs in Division One threatened to break away from the Football League, and in doing so, they managed to increase their voting power and gain a more favourable financial arrangement, taking a 50% share of all television and sponsorship income in 1986.[22] They demanded that television companies should pay more for their coverage of football matches,[23] and revenue from television grew in importance. The Football League received £6.3 million for a two-year agreement in 1986, but by 1988, in a deal agreed with ITV, the price rose to £44 million over four years, with the leading clubs taking 75% of the cash.[24][25] According to Scholar, who was involved in the negotiations of television deals, each of the First Division clubs received only around £25,000 per year from television rights before 1986, this increased to around £50,000 in the 1986 negotiation, then to £600,000 in 1988.[26] The 1988 negotiations were conducted under the threat of ten clubs leaving to form a \"super league\", but they were eventually persuaded to stay, with the top clubs taking the lion's share of the deal.[24][27][28] The negotiations also convinced the bigger clubs that, in order to receive enough votes, they needed to take the whole of the First Division with them instead of a smaller \"super league\".[29] By the beginning of the 1990s, the big clubs again considered breaking away, especially now that they had to fund the cost of stadium upgrades as proposed by the Taylor Report.[30] In 1990, the managing director of London Weekend Television (LWT), Greg Dyke, met with the representatives of the \"big five\" football clubs in England (Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur, Everton, and Arsenal) over a dinner.[31] The meeting was to pave the way for a breakaway from the Football League.[32] Dyke believed that it would be more lucrative for LWT if only the larger clubs in the country were featured on national television and wanted to establish whether the clubs would be interested in a larger share of television rights money.[33] The five clubs agreed with the suggestion and decided to press ahead with it; however, the league would have no credibility without the backing of the Football Association, and so David Dein of Arsenal held talks to see whether the FA were receptive to the idea. The FA did not have an amicable relationship with the Football League at the time and considered it a way to weaken the Football League's position.[34] The FA released a report in June 1991, Blueprint for the Future of Football, that supported the plan for the Premier League, with the FA as the ultimate authority that would oversee the breakaway league.[29] At the close of the 1990–1991 season, a proposal was tabled for the establishment of a new league that would bring more money into the game overall. The Founder Members Agreement, signed on 17 July 1991, by the game's top-flight clubs, established the basic principles for setting up the FA Premier League.[35] The newly formed top division was to have commercial independence from the Football Association and the Football League, giving the FA Premier League licence to negotiate its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements. The argument given at the time was that the extra income would allow English clubs to compete with teams across Europe.[20] Although Dyke played a significant role in the creation of the Premier League, he and ITV (of which LWT was part) lost out in the bidding for broadcast rights: BSkyB won with a bid of £304 million over five years, with the BBC awarded the highlights package broadcast on Match of the Day.[31][33] Luton Town, Notts County, and West Ham United were the three teams relegated from the old First Division at the end of the 1991–92 season, and did not take part in the inaugural Premier League season. They were replaced by Ipswich Town, Middlesbrough, and Blackburn Rovers, promoted from the old Second Division.[36] The 22 First Division clubs resigned en masse from the Football League in 1992, and on 27 May that year, the FA Premier League was formed as a limited company, working out of an office at the Football Association's then headquarters in Lancaster Gate.[20] The 22 inaugural members of the new Premier League were:[37] This meant a break-up of the 104-year-old Football League that had operated until then with four divisions; the Premier League would operate with a single division and the Football League with three. There was no change in competition format; the same number of teams competed in the top flight, and promotion and relegation between the Premier League and the new First Division remained the same as the old First and Second Divisions, with three teams relegated from the league and three promoted.[28] The league held its first season in 1992–93. It was composed of 22 clubs for that season (reduced to 20 in the 1995–96 season). The first Premier League goal was scored by Brian Deane of Sheffield United in a 2–1 win against Manchester United.[38] Manchester United won the inaugural edition of the new league, ending a twenty-six year wait to be crowned champions of England. Bolstered by this breakthrough, United immediately became the competition's dominant team, winning seven of the first nine trophies, two League and FA Cup 'doubles' and a European treble, initially under a team of hardened veterans such as Bryan Robson, Steve Bruce, Paul Ince, Mark Hughes, and Eric Cantona, before Cantona, Bruce, and Roy Keane led a young, dynamic new team filled with the Class of 92, a group of young players including David Beckham who came through the Manchester United Academy. Between 1993 and 1997, Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United came close to challenging Manchester United's early dominance; Blackburn won the 1994–95 FA Premier League and Newcastle led the title charge over United for much of the 1995–96 season. As the decade closed, Arsenal replicated Manchester United's dominance by winning the League and FA Cup double in 1997–98, and together they would form a duopoly over the league between 1997 and 2003. The 2000s saw the rise of Liverpool alongside the \"Big 2\", followed by Chelsea finally breaking the Arsenal–Man United duopoly by winning the league in 2004–05. The dominance of the so-called \"Big Four\" clubs – Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, and Manchester United[39][40] – saw them finish at the top of the table for most of the decade, thereby guaranteeing qualification for the UEFA Champions League. Only three other clubs managed to qualify for the competition during this period: Newcastle United (2001–02 and 2002–03), Everton (2004–05), and Tottenham Hotspur (2009–10) – each occupying the final Champions League spot, with the exception of Newcastle in the 2002–03 season, who finished third. Following the 2003–04 season, Arsenal acquired the nickname \"The Invincibles\" as they became the first and, to date, only club to complete a Premier League campaign without losing a single game.[41][42] In May 2008, Kevin Keegan stated that \"Big Four\" dominance threatened the division: \"This league is in danger of becoming one of the most boring but great leagues in the world.\"[43] Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said in defence: \"There are a lot of different tussles that go on in the Premier League depending on whether you're at the top, in the middle, or at the bottom that make it interesting.\"[44] Between 2005 and 2012, there was a Premier League representative in seven of the eight Champions League finals, with only the \"Big Four\" clubs reaching that stage. Liverpool (2005), Manchester United (2008), and Chelsea (2012) won the competition during this period, with Arsenal (2006), Liverpool (2007), Chelsea (2008), and Manchester United (2009 and 2011) all losing Champions League finals.[45] Leeds United were the only non-\"Big Four\" side to reach the semi-finals of the Champions League, in the 2000–01 season. There were three Premier League teams in the Champions League semi-finals in 2006–07, 2007–08, and 2008–09, a feat only ever achieved five times (along with Serie A in 2002–03 and La Liga in 1999–2000). Additionally, between the 1999–2000 and 2009–10 seasons, four Premier League sides reached the UEFA Cup or Europa League finals, with only Liverpool managing to win the competition in 2001. Arsenal (2000), Middlesbrough (2006), and Fulham (2010) all lost their finals.[46] Although the group's dominance was reduced to a degree after this period with the emergence of Manchester City and Tottenham, in terms of all-time Premier League points won, they remain clear by some margin. As of the end of the 2021–22 season – the 30th season of the Premier League – Liverpool, in fourth place in the all-time points table, were over 300 points ahead of the next team, Tottenham Hotspur. They are also the only teams to maintain a winning average of over 50% throughout their entire Premier League tenures.[47] The years following 2009 marked a shift from the \"Big Four\" with Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City breaking into the top four places on a regular basis, turning the \"Big Four\" into the \"Big Six\".[48] In the 2009–10 season, Tottenham finished fourth and became the first new team to finish in the top four since Everton five years prior.[49] Criticism of the gap between an elite group of \"super clubs\" and the majority of the Premier League has continued, nevertheless, due to their increasing ability to spend more than the other Premier League clubs.[50] Manchester City won the title in the 2011–12 season, becoming the first club outside the \"Big Four\" to win since Blackburn Rovers in the 1994–95 season. That season also saw two of the \"Big Four\" (Chelsea and Liverpool) finish outside the top four places for the first time since that season.[48] With only four UEFA Champions League qualifying places available in the league, greater competition for qualification now exists, albeit from a narrow base of six clubs. In the five seasons following the 2011–12 campaign, Manchester United and Liverpool both found themselves outside of the top four three times, whilst Chelsea finished 10th in the 2015–16 season. Arsenal finished 5th in 2016–17, ending their record run of 20 consecutive top-four finishes.[51] In the 2015–16 season, underdogs Leicester City won the Premier League. With 5000/1 odds of winning the league at the beginning of the season, Leicester became the first club outside the \"Big Six\" to win the Premier League since Blackburn Rovers in the 1994–95 season.[52] Off the pitch, the \"Big Six\" wield significant financial power and influence, with these clubs arguing that they should be entitled to a greater share of revenue due to the greater stature of their clubs globally and the attractive football they aim to play.[53] Objectors argue that the egalitarian revenue structure in the Premier League helps to maintain a competitive league which is vital for its future success.[54] The 2016–17 Deloitte Football Money League report showed the financial disparity between the \"Big Six\" and the rest of the division. All of the \"Big Six\" had revenues greater than €350 million, with Manchester United having the largest revenue in the league at €676.3 million. Leicester City was the closest club to the \"Big Six\" in terms of revenue, recording a figure of €271.1 million for that season – helped by participation in the Champions League. The eighth-largest revenue generator, West Ham – who did not play in European competition – had revenues of €213.3 million, less than half of those of the club with the fifth-largest revenue, Liverpool (€424.2 million).[55] A substantial part of the clubs' revenue by then came from television broadcast deals, with the biggest clubs each taking from around £150 million to nearly £200 million in the 2016–17 season from such deals.[56] In Deloitte's 2019 report, all the \"Big Six\" were in the top ten of the world's richest clubs.[57] From the 2019–20 season, video assistant referees were used in the league.[58] The 2019–20 season saw Liverpool win their first Premier League trophy, their first top-flight trophy in 30 years.[59] Project Big Picture was announced in October 2020 that described a plan to reunite the top Premier League clubs with the English Football League, proposed by leading Premier League clubs Manchester United and Liverpool.[60] It has been criticised by the Premier League leadership and the UK government's Department for Culture, Media and Sport.[61] On 26 April 2021, play was stopped during a match between Leicester City and Crystal Palace to allow players Wesley Fofana and Cheikhou Kouyaté to break Ramadan fast. It is believed to be the first time in Premier League history that a game was paused to allow Muslim players to eat and drink after the sun had set in accordance with the rules of the faith.[62] The 2022–23 season was the first to take a six-week break between November and December 2022 to allow for the first winter World Cup,[63] with a return for the Boxing Day fixtures.[64] The Premier League players decided to take the knee at selected \"significant moments\". They assured to \"remain resolutely committed to eradicate racial prejudice\".[65] That season was notable for Newcastle United and Brighton & Hove Albion breaking the traditional \"Big Six\" as they finished fourth and sixth, respectively, whilst \"Big Six\" teams Tottenham and Chelsea finished eighth and twelfth.[66][67] Meanwhile, 2015–16 champions Leicester City were relegated, becoming the second league-winning club to suffer relegation since 1992, after Blackburn Rovers in the 2011–12 season.[68] In the 2023–24 season, Manchester City won the Premier League for the sixth time in seven years to become the first top-flight team to win four consecutive league titles in English football history.[69] Meanwhile, non-Big Six club Aston Villa finished fourth and qualified for the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League.[70] The Football Association Premier League Ltd (FAPL)[71][72][73] is operated as a corporation and is owned by the 20 member clubs. Each club is a shareholder, with one vote each on issues such as rule changes and contracts. The clubs select a chairman, chief executive, and board of directors to oversee the daily operations of the league.[74] The Football Association is not directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the Premier League, but has veto power as a special shareholder during the election of the chairman and chief executive and when new rules are adopted by the league.[75] The current chief executive is Richard Masters, who was appointed in December 2019.[76] The chair is currently Alison Brittain, who took over the role in early 2023.[77] The Premier League sends representatives to UEFA's European Club Association, the number of clubs and the clubs themselves chosen according to UEFA coefficients. For the 2023–24 season, the Premier League has 13 representatives in the Association: Arsenal, Aston Villa, Brighton & Hove Albion, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Newcastle United, Nottingham Forest, Tottenham Hotspur, West Ham United, and Wolverhampton Wanderers.[78] The European Club Association is responsible for electing three members to UEFA's Club Competitions Committee, which is involved in the operations of UEFA competitions such as the Champions League and UEFA Europa League.[79] The Premier League has faced criticism of its governance due to an alleged lack of transparency and accountability. Following the Premier League's blocking of the attempted takeover of Newcastle United by a PIF-backed consortium through the league's Owners' and Directors' test, many MPs, Newcastle United fans and related parties to the deal denounced the Premier League for its perceived lack of transparency and accountability throughout the process.[80][81][82] On 6 July 2021, consortium member Amanda Staveley of PCP Capital Partners said that \"fans surely deserve absolute transparency from the regulators across all their processes – to best ensure that they act responsibly. They (the Premier League) are performing a function like that of a government regulator – but without the same systems for accountability.\"[82] On 22 July 2021, Tracey Crouch MP – chair of the fan-led review into the UK's football governance – announced in the review's interim findings that the Premier League had \"lost the trust and confidence\" of fans. The review also recommended that a new independent regulator be created to oversee matters such as club takeovers.[83][84] Premier League chief executive Richard Masters had earlier spoken out against the implementation of an independent regulator, saying in May 2021, \"I don't think that the independent regulator is the answer to the question. I would defend the Premier League's role as regulator of its clubs over the past 30 years.\"[85] [The Premier League] is very tough and is different. If you compare this league to another league, it's like playing another sport. In [The Premier League] you never really know what is going to happen, there is very little between the teams. There are 20 clubs in the Premier League. During the course of a season (from August to May) each club plays the others twice (a double round-robin system), once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents, for 38 games. Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw. No points are awarded for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, then goal difference, and then goals scored. If still equal, teams are deemed to occupy the same position. If there is a tie for the championship, for relegation, or for qualification to other competitions, the head-to-head record between the tied teams is taken into consideration (points scored in the matches between the teams, followed by away goals in those matches.) If two teams are still tied, a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank.[88] A system of promotion and relegation exists between the Premier League and the EFL Championship. The three lowest placed teams in the Premier League are relegated to the Championship, and the top two teams from the Championship promoted to the Premier League,[89] with an additional team promoted after a series of play-offs involving the third, fourth, fifth and sixth placed clubs.[90] The number of clubs was reduced from 22 to 20 in 1995, when four teams were relegated from the league and only two teams promoted.[91][92] The top flight had only been expanded to 22 teams at the start of the 1991–92 season – the year prior to the formation of the Premier League.[92] On 8 June 2006, FIFA requested that all major European leagues, including Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga, be reduced to 18 teams by the start of the 2007–08 season. The Premier League responded by announcing their intention to resist such a reduction.[93] Ultimately, the 2007–08 season kicked off again with 20 teams.[94] Video assistant referee (VAR), was introduced to the Premier League at the beginning of the 2019–20 season. It uses technology and officials to assist the referee in making decisions on the pitch.[95] However, its use has been met with mixed receptions from fans and pundits, with some praising its accuracy whilst others criticise its impact on the flow of the game and consistency of decision-making. The on-field referee still makes the final decision, but VAR can assist the referee in the decision-making process. VAR can only be used for four types of decisions: goals, penalty decisions, direct red card incidents, and cases of mistaken identity. VAR officials review the video footage and communicate with the on-field referee via a headset. The VAR officials are located in a central control room, which is equipped with multiple camera angles and the ability to replay footage at various speeds. A study evaluating fan reception of VAR in the Premier League was made by Otto Kolbinger and Melanie Knopp and was done by analysing Twitter data.[96] The researchers used sentiment analysis to measure the overall positive or negative attitudes towards VAR, as well as topic modelling to identify specific issues that fans are discussing related to VAR. The study found that the reception of VAR on Twitter is largely negative, with fans expressing frustration and criticism of the technology's impact on the flow of the game and the inconsistency of decisions. The researchers also identified specific issues, such as handball and offside decisions, that fans are particularly critical of. The study concludes that VAR has not been well received by fans in the Premier League, and that efforts to improve the technology and increase transparency in decision-making are needed to address these concerns. Fifty-one clubs have played in the Premier League from its inception in 1992, up to and including the 2023–24 season.[97] Titles won by club (%) Italics indicate former Premier League champions that are currently outside the Premier League. Twenty clubs are competing in the 2024–25 season – top seventeen from the previous season and three promoted from the Championship. In 2011, after Swansea City gained promotion, a Welsh club participated in the Premier League for the first time.[98][99] The first Premier League match to be played outside England was Swansea City's home match at Liberty Stadium against Wigan Athletic on 20 August 2011.[100] The number of Welsh clubs in the Premier League increased to two in 2013–14, as Cardiff City gained promotion,[101] but they were relegated after their maiden season.[102] Cardiff were promoted again in 2017–18 but the number of Welsh clubs remained the same for the 2018–19 Premier League season, as Swansea City had been relegated from the Premier League in 2017–18.[103] Following Cardiff City's relegation after the 2018–19 season, there are currently no Welsh clubs participating in the Premier League.[104] Because they are members of the Football Association of Wales (FAW), the question of whether clubs like Swansea should represent England or Wales in European competitions has caused long-running discussions in UEFA. Swansea took one of England's three available places in the Europa League in 2013–14 by winning the League Cup in 2012–13.[105] The right of Welsh clubs to take up such English places was in doubt until UEFA clarified the matter in March 2012, allowing them to participate.[106] Participation in the Premier League by some Scottish or Irish clubs has sometimes been discussed, but without result. The idea came closest to reality in 1998, when Wimbledon received Premier League approval to relocate to Dublin, Ireland, but the move was blocked by the Football Association of Ireland.[107][108][109][110] Additionally, the media occasionally discusses the idea that Scotland's two biggest teams, Celtic and Rangers, should or will take part in the Premier League, but nothing has come of these discussions.[111] The top four teams in the Premier League qualify automatically for the subsequent season's UEFA Champions League league phase. The champions of the Champions League and UEFA Europa League may earn an additional qualification for the subsequent season's Champions League league phase if did not finish in the top four. If this means six Premier League teams qualify, then the fourth-placed team in the Premier League is instead entered in the Europa League, as any single nation is limited to a maximum of five teams in the Champions League. However, starting from the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League there are additional berths for the two best associations in the previous season's ranking, which may result in a maximum of six teams from one association in the Champions League. The fifth-placed team in the Premier League, as well as the winners of the FA Cup, qualify for the subsequent season's Europa League league phase, but if the winner of the FA Cup also finishes in the top five places in the Premier League or has won one of UEFA's major tournaments, then this place reverts to the team that finished sixth. The winner of the EFL Cup qualifies for the subsequent season's UEFA Conference League, but if the winner had already qualified for a UEFA competition via their performance in another competition, then this place reverts to the team that finished sixth in the Premier League, or seventh if the FA Cup result had already caused the sixth-placed team to qualify.[112] The number of places allocated to English clubs in UEFA competitions is dependent upon the position the country holds in the UEFA coefficient rankings, which are calculated based on the performance of teams in UEFA competitions over the previous five years. Currently, England is ranked first, ahead of Spain. As of 26 September 2024, the coefficients for are as follows (only top five European leagues are shown):[113][114] An exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions League the season before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers.[115] The governing body subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that if the Champions League winners finished outside the top four in its domestic league, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team. At that time, no association could have more than four entrants in the Champions League.[116] This occurred in 2012, when Chelsea – who had won the Champions League that summer, but finished sixth in the league – qualified for the 2012–13 Champions League in place of Tottenham Hotspur, who went into the Europa League.[117] From 2015–16, the Europa League champions qualify for the Champions League, increasing the maximum number of participants per country to five.[118] This took effect in England in 2016–17, when Manchester United finished sixth in the Premier League and won the Europa League, giving England five Champions League entrants for 2017–18.[119] In these instances, any Europa League berth vacated is not handed down to the next-best Premier League finisher outside of a qualifying place. If both Champions League and Europa League winners are of the same association and both finish outside the top four, then the fourth-placed team is transferred to the Europa League. With 48 continental trophies won, English clubs are the third-most successful in European football, behind Italy (50) and Spain (67). In the top-tier UEFA Champions League, a record six English clubs have won a total of 15 titles and lost a further 11 finals, behind Spanish clubs with 20 and 11, respectively.[120] In the second-tier UEFA Europa League, English clubs are third, with nine victories and eight losses in the finals.[121] In the former second-tier UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, English teams won a record eight titles and had a further five finalists.[122] In the non-UEFA organised Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, English clubs provided four winners and four runners-up, the second-most behind Spain with six and three, respectively.[123] In the newly created third-tier UEFA Conference League, English clubs have won a joint-record one title so far.[124] In the former fourth-tier UEFA Intertoto Cup, England won four titles and had a further final appearance, placing it fifth in the rankings, although English clubs were notorious for treating the tournament with disdain, either sending \"B\" squads or withdrawing from it altogether.[125][126][127] In the one-off UEFA Super Cup, England has ten winners and ten runners-up, the second-most behind Spain with 17 and 15, respectively.[128] Similarly to the Intertoto Cup, English teams did not take the former Intercontinental Cup seriously enough, despite its international status of the Club World Championship. They a made a total of six appearances in the one-off competition, winning only one of them, and withdrew a further three times.[129] English clubs have won the FIFA-organised Club World Cup four times, tied for the second-most with Brazil, and behind only Spain, with eight.[130][127] After an inaugural season with no sponsorship, the Premier League was sponsored by Carling from 1993 until 2001, during which time it was known as the FA Carling Premiership. In 2001, a new sponsorship deal with Barclaycard saw the league rebranded the FA Barclaycard Premiership, which was changed to the FA Barclays Premiership in time for the 2004–05 season. For the 2007–08 season, the league was rebranded the Barclays Premier League.[131][132] Barclays' deal with the Premier League expired at the end of the 2015–16 season. The organisation announced on 4 June 2015 that it would not pursue any further title sponsorship deals for the Premier League, arguing that they wanted to build a \"clean\" brand for the competition more in line with those of major U.S. sports leagues.[134] As well as sponsorship for the league itself, the Premier League has a number of official partners and suppliers.[135] The official ball supplier for the league is Nike who have had the contract since the 2000–01 season when they took over from Mitre.[136] Under its Merlin brand, Topps held the licence to produce collectables for the Premier League between 1994 and 2019 including stickers (for their sticker album) and trading cards.[137] Launched in the 2007–08 season, Topps' Match Attax, the official Premier League trading card game, is the best selling boys collectable in the UK, and is also the biggest selling sports trading card game in the world.[137][138] In October 2018, Panini were awarded the licence to produce collectables from the 2019–20 season.[139] The chocolate company Cadbury has been the official snack partner of the Premier League since 2017, and sponsored the Golden Boot, Golden Glove and Playmaker of the Season awards from the 2017–18 season to 2019–20 season.[140][141] The Coca-Cola Company (under its Coca-Cola Zero Sugar product line) sponsored these awards during the 2020–21 season with Castrol being the current sponsor as of the 2021–22 season.[142] The Premier League has the highest revenue of any association football league in the world, with total club revenues of €2.48 billion in 2009–10.[143][144] In 2013–14, due to improved television revenues and cost controls, the Premier League clubs collectively made a net profit in excess of £78 million, exceeding all other football leagues.[145] In 2010 the Premier League was awarded the Queen's Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category for its outstanding contribution to international trade and the value it brings to English football and the United Kingdom's broadcasting industry.[146] The Premier League includes some of the richest football clubs in the world. Deloitte's \"Football Money League\" listed seven Premier League clubs in the top 20 for the 2009–10 season,[147] and all 20 clubs were in the top 40 globally by the end of the 2013–14 season, largely as a result of increased broadcasting revenue.[148] In 2019, the league generated around £3.1 billion per year in domestic and international television rights.[4] Premier League clubs agreed in principle in December 2012, to radical new cost controls. The two proposals consist of a break-even rule and a cap on the amount clubs can increase their wage bill by each season. With the new television deals on the horizon, momentum has been growing to find ways of preventing the majority of the cash going straight to players and agents.[149] Central payments for the 2016–17 season amounted to £2,398,515,773 across the 20 clubs, with each team receiving a flat participation fee of £35,301,989 and additional payments for TV broadcasts (£1,016,690 for general UK rights to match highlights, £1,136,083 for each live UK broadcast of their games and £39,090,596 for all overseas rights), commercial rights (a flat fee of £4,759,404) and a notional measure of \"merit\" which was based upon final league position.[8] The merit component was a nominal sum of £1,941,609 multiplied by each finishing place, counted from the foot of the table (e.g., Burnley finished 16th in May 2017, five places counting upwards, and received 5 × £1,941,609 = £9,708,045 merit payment).[8] Since its split with the Football League, established clubs in the Premier League have a funding disparity from counterparts in lower leagues. Revenue from television rights between the leagues has played a part in this.[150] Promoted teams have found it difficult to avoid relegation in their first Premier League season. One Premier League newcomer has been relegated back to the Football League every season, save the 2001–02, 2011–12, 2017–18 & 2022–23 seasons. In the 1997–98 and 2023–24 seasons, all three promoted clubs were relegated by the season's end.[151] The Premier League distributes a portion of its television revenue as \"parachute payments\" to relegated clubs for adjustment to television revenue loss. The average Premier League team receives £41 million[152] whilst the average Championship club receives £2 million.[153] Starting with the 2013–14 season, these payments are in excess of £60 million over four seasons.[154] Critics maintain that the payments widen the gap between teams that have reached the Premier League and those that have not,[155] leading to the common occurrence of teams \"bouncing back\" soon after their relegation. Clubs which have failed to win immediate promotion back to the Premier League have seen financial problems, in some cases administration or liquidation. Further relegations down the footballing ladder have occurred for multiple clubs unable to cope with the gap.[156][157] Television has played a major role in the history of the Premier League. The League's decision to assign broadcasting rights to Sky in 1992 was at the time a radical decision, but one that has paid off. At the time, paid television was an almost untested proposition in the UK market as was charging fans to watch live televised football. However, a combination of Sky's strategy, the quality of Premier League football and the public's appetite for the game has seen the value of the Premier League's TV rights soar.[25] The Premier League sells its television rights on a collective basis. This is in contrast to some other European leagues, including La Liga, in which each club sells its rights individually, leading to a much higher share of the total income going to the top few clubs.[159] The money is divided into three parts:[160] half is divided equally between the clubs; one quarter is awarded on a merit basis based on final league position, the top club getting twenty times as much as the bottom club, and equal steps all the way down the table; the final quarter is paid out as facilities fees for games that are shown on television, with the top clubs generally receiving the largest shares of this. The income from overseas rights is divided equally between the twenty clubs.[161] Not all Premier League matches are televised in the United Kingdom, as the league upholds the long-standing prohibition on telecasts of any association football match (domestic or otherwise) that kicks off between 2:45 p.m. and 5:15 p.m. on Saturday matchdays.[162][163][164] The first Sky television rights agreement was worth £304 million over five seasons.[165] The next contract, negotiated to start from the 1997–98 season, rose to £670 million over four seasons.[165] The third contract was a £1.024 billion deal with BSkyB for the three seasons from 2001 to 2004. The league brought in £320 million from the sale of its international rights for the three-year period from 2004 to 2007. It sold the rights itself on a territory-by-territory basis.[166] Sky's monopoly was broken from August 2006 when Setanta Sports was awarded rights to show two out of the six packages of matches available. This occurred following an insistence by the European Commission that exclusive rights should not be sold to one television company. Sky and Setanta paid £1.7 billion, a two-thirds increase which took many commentators by surprise as it had been widely assumed that the value of the rights had levelled off following many years of rapid growth. Setanta also hold rights to a live 3 pm match solely for Irish viewers. The BBC retained the rights to show highlights for the same three seasons (on Match of the Day) for £171.6 million, a 63 per cent increase on the £105 million it paid for the previous three-year period.[167] Sky and BT Group (via its new channel BT Sport, now TNT Sports) agreed to jointly pay £84.3 million for delayed television rights to 242 games (that is the right to broadcast them in full on television and over the internet) in most cases for a period of 50 hours after 10 p.m. on matchday.[168] Overseas television rights fetched £625 million, nearly double the previous contract.[169] The total raised from those deals was more than £2.7 billion, giving Premier League clubs an average media income from league games of around £40 million-a-year from 2007 to 2010.[170] The TV rights agreement between the Premier League and Sky faced accusations of being a cartel, and a number of court cases arose as a result.[171] An investigation by the Office of Fair Trading in 2002 found BSkyB to be dominant within the pay TV sports market, but concluded that there were insufficient grounds for the claim that BSkyB had abused its dominant position.[172] In July 1999 the Premier League's method of selling rights collectively for all member clubs was investigated by the UK Restrictive Practices Court, which concluded that the agreement was not contrary to the public interest.[173] The BBC's highlights package on Saturday and Sunday nights, as well as other evenings when fixtures justify, ran until 2016.[174] Television rights alone for the period 2010 to 2013 were purchased for £1.782 billion.[175] On 22 June 2009, due to troubles encountered by Setanta Sports after it failed to meet a final deadline over a £30 million payment to the Premier League, ESPN was awarded two packages of UK rights containing 46 matches that were available for the 2009–10 season as well as a package of 23 matches per season from 2010 to 2013.[176] On 13 June 2012, the Premier League announced that BT had been awarded 38 games a season for the 2013–14, 2014–15 and 2015–16 seasons at £246 million-a-year. The remaining 116 games were retained by Sky, which paid £760 million-a-year. The total domestic rights raised £3.018 billion, an increase of 70.2% over the 2010–11 to 2012–13 rights.[177] The value of the licensing deal rose by another 70.2% in 2015, when Sky and BT paid £5.136 billion to renew their contracts with the Premier League for another three years up to the 2018–19 season.[178] A new rights cycle began in the 2019–20 season, with the domestic package increasing to 200 matches overall; in February 2018, BT were awarded the package of 32 lunchtime fixtures on Saturdays, whilst Sky was awarded four of the seven packages, covering the majority of weekend fixtures (including eight new prime time fixtures on Saturdays), as well as Monday and Friday matches. Two remaining packages of 20 fixtures each were to be sold at a later date, including three rounds of mid-week fixtures and a bank holiday round. As Sky already owned the maximum number of matches it could hold without breaching a 148-match cap, it was speculated that at least one of the new packages could go to a new entrant, such as a streaming service. The five packages sold to BT and Sky were valued at £4.464 billion.[179] In June 2018, it was announced that Amazon Prime Video and BT had acquired the remaining two packages; Amazon acquired rights to 20 matches per-season, covering a mid-week round in December, and all Boxing Day fixtures.[180] The Amazon telecasts are produced in association with Sunset + Vine and BT Sport.[181] With the resumption of play in the 2019–20 Premier League due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, the Premier League announced that all remaining matches would be carried on British television, split primarily across Sky, BT, and Amazon. A large number of these matches were also scheduled for free-to-air broadcasts, with Sky airing 25 on Pick, Amazon streaming its four matches on Twitch, and the BBC – for the first time in league history – carrying four live matches.[182][183][184][185] As matches would continue to be played without spectators upon the start of the 2020–21 Premier League, its clubs voted on 8 September to continue broadcasting all matches through at least September (with the BBC and Amazon each holding one additional match), and \"appropriate arrangements\" being made for October.[186][187] It was later announced that matches not selected for broadcast would be carried on pay-per-view via BT Sport Box Office and Sky Box Office at a cost of £14.95 per-match. The PPV scheme was poorly received; the Football Supporters' Federation felt that the price was too high, and there were concerns that it could encourage piracy. There were calls from supporters to boycott the pay-per-views, and make donations to support charitable causes instead (with Newcastle's \"Charity Not PPV\" campaign raising £20,000 for a local food bank, and Arsenal fans raising £34,000 for Islington Giving). On 13 November, amid the reintroduction of measures across the UK, the Premier League officially announced that the non-televised matches would be assigned to its main broadcast partners, and again including additional matches for the BBC and Amazon Prime.[188][189][190][191] The next cycle of rights between 2022–23 and 2024–25 season was renewed without tender due to compelling and exceptional circumstances in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, rights remained as they were since the 2019–20 season.[192] UK highlights In August 2016, it was announced the BBC would be creating a new magazine-style show for the Premier League entitled The Premier League Show.[193] The Premier League is the most-watched football league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people.[9] The Premier League's production arm, Premier League Productions, is operated by IMG Productions and produces content for its international television partners.[194] On 22 November 2024, the Premier League announced plans to end its agreement with IMG and take Premier League Productions in-house beginning in 2026–27.[195] The Premier League is the most widely distributed sports programme in Asia.[196] In the Indian subcontinent, the matches are broadcast live on STAR Sports.[197] In MENA region, BeIN Sports holds exclusive rights to the Premier League.[198] In China, the broadcast rights were awarded to iQiyi, Migu and CCTV that began in the 2021–22 season.[199][200][201] SCTV broadcast the matches for Indonesia, and Astro for Malaysia. In Australia, Optus telecommunications holds exclusive rights to the Premier League, providing live broadcasts and online access (Fox Sports formerly held rights).[202] As of the 2022–23 season, Canadian media rights to the Premier League are owned by FuboTV,[203] after having been jointly owned by Sportsnet and TSN, and most recently DAZN.[204] The Premier League is broadcast in the United States by NBC Sports, a division of Sky parent Comcast.[205] Acquiring the rights to the Premier League in 2013 (replacing Fox Soccer and ESPN), NBC Sports has been widely praised for its coverage.[206][207][208] NBC Sports reached a six-year extension with the Premier League in 2015 to broadcast the league until the end of the 2021–22 season in a deal valued at $1 billion (£640 million).[209][210] In November 2021, NBC reached another six-year extension through 2028 in a deal valued at $2.76 billion (£2 billion).[211][212] The Premier League is broadcast by SuperSport across sub-Saharan Africa.[213] Broadcasters to continental Europe until 2025 include Canal+ for France,[214] Sky Sport Germany for Germany and Austria,[215] Match TV for Russia,[216] Sky Sport Italy for Italy,[217] Eleven Sports for Portugal,[218] DAZN for Spain,[219] beIN Sports Turkey to Turkey,[220] Digi Sport for Romania,[221] and NENT to Nordic countries (Sweden, Denmark and Norway),[222] Poland and the Netherlands.[223] In South America, ESPN covers much of the continent,[224] with coverage in Brazil shared between ESPN Brasil and ESPN4.[225][226] Paramount+ broadcasts the league in Central America.[227] As of the 2023–24 season, Premier League football has been played in 61 stadiums since the formation of the division.[228] The Hillsborough disaster in 1989 and the subsequent Taylor Report saw a recommendation that standing terraces should be abolished. As a result, all stadiums in the Premier League are all-seater.[229][230] Since the formation of the Premier League, football grounds in England have seen constant improvements to capacity and facilities, with some clubs moving to new-build stadiums.[231] Eleven stadiums that have seen Premier League football have now been demolished. The stadiums for the 2023–24 season show a large disparity in capacity. For example, Old Trafford, the home of Manchester United, has a capacity of 74,031 whilst Dean Court, the home of Bournemouth, has a capacity of 11,307. The combined total capacity of the Premier League in the 2023–24 season is 787,002 with an average capacity of 39,350. Stadium attendances are a significant source of regular income for Premier League clubs.[232] For the 2022–23 season, average attendances across the league clubs were 40,235 for Premier League matches with an aggregate attendance of 15,289,340.[233] This represents an increase of 19,109 from the average attendance of 21,126 recorded in the Premier League's first season (1992–93).[234] However, during the 1992–93 season, the capacities of most stadiums were reduced as clubs replaced terraces with seats in order to meet the Taylor Report's 1994–95 deadline for all-seater stadiums.[235][236] The 2022–23 season also set a competition record for total attendance with more than 15 million spectators, with average attendance also reaching record levels, surpassing the previous record of 39,989 set in the 2021–22 season, which in turn broke over 70 years old record set in 1948–49 season.[237] In October 2024 it was reported that the government is planning to grant the independent regulator authority to stop Premier League clubs from selling their stadiums to affiliated or third-party companies.[238] I have never known this level before. Of course, there are managers in Germany, Italy, and Spain, but in the Premier League, these are the best managers, the elite managers. The quality, the preparation. The level is so high. Managers in the Premier League are involved in the day-to-day running of the team, including the training, team selection and player acquisition. Their influence varies from club-to-club and is related to the ownership of the club and the relationship of the manager with fans.[240] Managers are required to have a UEFA Pro Licence which is the final coaching qualification available, and follows the completion of the UEFA 'B' and 'A' Licences.[241] The UEFA Pro Licence is required by every person who wishes to manage a club in the Premier League on a permanent basis (i.e., more than 12 weeks, the amount of time an unqualified caretaker manager is allowed to take control).[242] Caretaker appointments are managers that fill the gap between a managerial departure and a new appointment. Several caretaker managers have gone on to secure a permanent managerial post after performing well as a caretaker, including Paul Hart at Portsmouth, David Pleat at Tottenham Hotspur and Ole Gunnar Solskjær at Manchester United. Arsène Wenger is the longest-serving manager, having been in charge of Arsenal in the Premier League from 1996 to his departure at the conclusion of the 2017–18 season, and holds the record for most matches managed in the Premier League with 828, all with Arsenal. He broke the record set by Alex Ferguson, who had managed 810 matches with Manchester United from the Premier League's inception to his retirement at the end of the 2012–13 season. Ferguson was in charge of Manchester United from November 1986 until his retirement at the end of the 2012–13 season, meaning he was manager for the last five years of the old Football League First Division and all of the first 21 seasons of the Premier League.[243] Notably, since its creation the Premier League has never been won by an English manager. There have been several studies into the reasoning behind, and effects of, managerial sackings. Most famously, Sue Bridgewater of the University of Liverpool and Bas ter Weel of the University of Amsterdam, performed two separate studies which helped to explain the statistics behind managerial sackings. Bridgewater's study found clubs generally sack their managers upon dropping below an average of one point per match.[244] Player transfers may only take place within transfer windows set by the Football Association. The two transfer windows run from the last day of the season to 31 August and from 31 December to 31 January. Player registrations cannot be exchanged outside these windows except under specific licence from the FA, usually on an emergency basis.[246] As of the 2010–11 season, the Premier League introduced new rules mandating that each club must register a maximum 25-man squad of players aged over 21, with the squad list only allowed to be changed in transfer windows or in exceptional circumstances.[247][248] This was to enable the \"home grown\" rule to be enacted, whereby the Premier League would also from 2010 require at least eight members of the named 25-man squad to be \"home-grown players\".[247] At the inception of the Premier League in 1992–93, just 11 players named in the starting line-ups for the first round of matches hailed from outside of the United Kingdom or Ireland.[249] By 2000–01, the number of foreign players participating in the Premier League was 36% of the total. In the 2004–05 season, the figure had increased to 45%. On 26 December 1999, Chelsea became the first Premier League side to field an entirely foreign starting line-up,[250] and on 14 February 2005, Arsenal were the first to name a completely foreign 16-man squad for a match.[251] By 2009, under 40% of the players in the Premier League were English.[252] By February 2020, 117 different nationalities had played in the Premier League, and 101 nationalities had scored in the competition.[253] In 1999, in response to concerns that clubs were increasingly passing over young English players in favour of foreign players, the Home Office tightened its rules for granting work permits to players from countries outside of the European Union.[254] A non-EU player applying for the permit must have played for his country in at least 75 per cent of its competitive 'A' team matches for which he was available for selection during the previous two years, and his country must have averaged at least 70th place in the official FIFA world rankings over the previous two years. If a player does not meet those criteria, the club wishing to sign him may appeal.[255] Following the implementation of Brexit in January 2021, new regulations were introduced which require all foreign players to obtain a Governing Body Endorsement (GBE) in order to play football in the United Kingdom, regardless of EU status.[256] Italics denotes players still playing professional football,Bold denotes players still playing in the Premier League. The Premier League Golden Boot is awarded each season to the top scorer in the division. Former Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United striker Alan Shearer holds the record for most Premier League goals with 260.[258] Thirty-three players have reached the 100-goal mark.[259] Since the first Premier League season in 1992–93, 23 players from 11 clubs have won or shared the top scorer title.[260] Thierry Henry won his fourth overall scoring title by scoring 27 goals in the 2005–06 season. Erling Haaland holds the record for most goals in a Premier League season (38 matches) with 36 goals as of 15 May 2023.[261] Ryan Giggs of Manchester United holds the record for scoring goals in consecutive seasons, having scored in the first 21 seasons of the league.[262] Giggs also holds the record for the most Premier League assists, with 162.[263] There is no team or individual salary cap in the Premier League. As a result of the increasingly lucrative television deals, player wages rose sharply following the formation of the Premier League, when the average player wage was £75,000 per year.[264] In the 2018–19 season the average annual salary stood at £2.99 million. The total salary bill for the 20 Premier League clubs in the 2018–19 season was £1.62 billion; this compares to £1.05 billion in La Liga, £0.83 billion in Serie A, £0.72 billion in Bundesliga, and £0.54 billion in Ligue 1. The club with the highest average wage is Manchester United at £6.5 million. This is smaller than the club with the highest wage bill in Spain (Barcelona £10.5 million) and Italy (Juventus £6.7 million), but higher than in Germany (Bayern Munich £6.4 million) and France (Paris Saint-Germain £6.1 million). For the 2018–19 season, the ratio of the wages of the highest-paid team to lowest-paid in the Premier League is 6.82 to 1. This is much lower than in La Liga (19.1 to 1), Serie A (16 to 1), Bundesliga (20.5 to 1), and Ligue 1 (26.6 to 1). Because of the lower differential between team wage bills in the Premier League, it is often regarded as being more competitive than other top European leagues.[265] The record transfer fee for a Premier League player has risen steadily over the lifetime of the competition. Before the start of the first Premier League season, Alan Shearer became the first British player to command a transfer fee of more than £3 million.[266] The record has increased steadily and Enzo Fernández is now the most expensive transfer fee paid by a Premier League club at £106.8 million, whilst Philippe Coutinho is the biggest transfer involving a Premier League club at £105 million. The Premier League maintains two trophies – the genuine trophy (held by the reigning champions) and a spare replica. Two trophies are held for the purpose of making the award within minutes of the title being secured, in the event that on the final day of the season two clubs are still within reach of winning the League.[293] In the rare event that more than two clubs are vying for the title on the final day of the season, a replica won by a previous club is used.[294] The current Premier League trophy was created by Royal Jewellers Garrard & Co/Asprey of London and was designed in house at Garrard & Co by Trevor Brown and Paul Marsden. It consists of a trophy with a golden crown and a malachite plinth base. The plinth weighs 33 pounds (15 kg) and the trophy weighs 22 pounds (10.0 kg).[295] The trophy and plinth are 76 cm (30 in) tall, 43 cm (17 in) wide and 25 cm (9.8 in) deep.[296] Its main body is solid sterling silver and silver gilt, whilst its plinth is made of malachite, a semi-precious stone. The plinth has a silver band around its circumference, upon which the names of the title-winning clubs are listed. The green of the malachite represents the green field of play.[296] The design of the trophy is based on the heraldry of Three Lions that is associated with English football. Two of the lions are found above the handles on either side of the trophy – the third is symbolised by the captain of the title-winning team as he raises the trophy, and its gold crown, above his head at the end of the season.[297] The ribbons that drape the handles are presented in the team colours of the league champions that year. In 2004, a special gold version of the trophy was commissioned to commemorate Arsenal winning the title without a single defeat.[298] In addition to the winner's trophy and the individual winner's medals awarded to players who win the title, the Premier League also issues other awards throughout the season. A man-of-the-match award is awarded to the player who has the greatest impact in an individual match. Monthly awards are also given for the Manager of the Month, Player of the Month and Goal of the Month.[299] These are also issued annually for Manager of the Season,[300] Player of the Season[301] and Goal of the Season. The Young Player of the Season award is given to the most outstanding U-23 player starting from the 2019–20 season.[302] The Golden Boot award is given to the top goalscorer of every season, the Playmaker of the Season award is given to the player who makes the most assists of every season,[141] and the Golden Glove award is given to the goalkeeper with the most clean sheets at the end of the season.[303] Starting with the 2021–22 season, four new awards are given. The Save of the Season is awarded to the goalkeeper deemed to have made the most impressive save.[304] The Game Changer of the Season is earned by the player with the single most game-changing performance over the course of the campaign.[305] The Most Powerful Goal is given to the player whose goal-scoring shot had the highest average velocity from the time it was struck to the time it crossed the goal line, and the Most Improbable Comeback award is meant for the team that, based on calculations performed by Oracle Corporation, goes behind and overcomes a deficit to win their respective match.[306] From the 2017–18 season, players receive a milestone award for 100 appearances and every century there after and also players who score 50 goals and multiples thereof. Each player to reach these milestones is to receive a presentation box from the Premier League containing a special medallion and a plaque commemorating their achievement.[307] In 2012, the Premier League celebrated its second decade by holding the 20 Seasons Awards:[308] Bibliography",

                "content": "George Soros[a] HonFBA (born György Schwartz; August 12, 1930)[1][2] is an American[b] investor and philanthropist.[7][8] As of October 2023[update], he had a net worth of US$6.7 billion,[9][10] having donated more than $32 billion to the Open Society Foundations,[11] of which $15 billion has already been distributed, representing 64% of his original fortune. In 2020, Forbes called Soros the \"most generous giver\" (in terms of percentage of net worth).[12] He is a resident of New York.[13] Born in Budapest to a non-observant Jewish family, Soros survived the Nazi occupation of Hungary and moved to the United Kingdom in 1947. He studied at the London School of Economics and was awarded a BSc in philosophy in 1951, and then a Master of Science degree, also in philosophy, in 1954.[14][15][16] Soros started his career working in British and American merchant banks, before setting up his first hedge fund, Double Eagle, in 1969.[17] Profits from this fund provided the seed money for Soros Fund Management, his second hedge fund, in 1970. Double Eagle was renamed Quantum Fund and was the principal firm Soros advised. At its founding, Quantum Fund had $12 million in assets under management, and as of 2011[update] it had $25 billion, the majority of Soros's overall net worth.[18] Soros is known as \"The Man Who Broke the Bank of England\" as a result of his short sale of US$10 billion worth of pounds sterling, which made him a profit of $1 billion, during the 1992 Black Wednesday UK currency crisis.[19] Based on his early studies of philosophy, Soros formulated the General Theory of Reflexivity for capital markets, to provide insights into asset bubbles and fundamental/market value of securities, as well as value discrepancies used for shorting and swapping stocks.[20] Soros supports progressive and liberal political causes, to which he dispenses donations through the Open Society Foundations.[21] Between 1979 and 2011, he donated more than $11 billion to various philanthropic causes;[22][23] by 2017, his donations \"on civil initiatives to reduce poverty and increase transparency, and on scholarships and universities around the world\" totaled $12 billion.[24] He influenced the fall of communism in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s,[25] and provided one of Europe's largest higher education endowments to the Central European University in his Hungarian hometown.[26] Soros's extensive funding of political causes has made him a \"bugaboo of European nationalists\".[27] Numerous far-right theorists have promoted claims that characterize Soros as a dangerous \"puppet master\" behind alleged global plots.[28][29][30] Criticisms of Soros, who is of Jewish descent, have often been called antisemitic.[31][32][33] In 2018, The New York Times reported that \"conspiracy theories about him have gone mainstream, to nearly every corner of the Republican Party\".[28] György Schwartz was born on 12 August 1930 in Budapest in the Kingdom of Hungary to a prosperous non-observant Jewish family, who, like many upper-middle class Hungarian Jews at the time, were uncomfortable with their roots. Soros has wryly described his home as a Jewish antisemitic home.[34] The family of his mother Erzsébet (also known as Elizabeth) operated a successful silk store.[35] His father Tivadar (also known as Teodoro Ŝvarc) was a lawyer and a well-known Esperanto author who edited the Esperanto literary magazine Literatura Mondo and raised his son to speak the language.[35][36] Tivadar had also been a prisoner of war during and after World War I until he escaped from Russia and rejoined his family in Budapest.[37][38] His parents married in 1924. In 1936, Soros's family changed their name from the German-Jewish \"Schwartz\" to \"Soros\", as protective camouflage in increasingly antisemitic Hungary.[39][40] Tivadar liked the new name because it is a palindrome and because of its meaning. In Hungarian, soros means \"next\"; in Esperanto it means \"will soar\".[41][42][43] Soros was 13 years old in March 1944 when Nazi Germany occupied Hungary.[44] The Nazis barred Jewish children from attending school, and Soros and the other schoolchildren were made to report to the Judenrat (\"Jewish Council\"), which had been established during the occupation. Soros later described this time to writer Michael Lewis: The Jewish Council asked the little kids to hand out the deportation notices. I was told to go to the Jewish Council. And there I was given these small slips of paper ... I took this piece of paper to my father. He instantly recognized it. This was a list of Hungarian Jewish lawyers. He said, \"You deliver the slips of paper and tell the people that if they report they will be deported\". I'm not sure to what extent he knew they were going to be gassed. I did what my father said.[45][46] Soros did not return to that job; his family survived the war by purchasing documents to say that they were Christians.[47] Later that year at age 14, Soros posed as the Christian godson of an official of the collaborationist Hungarian government's Ministry of Agriculture, who himself had a Jewish wife in hiding. On one occasion, rather than leave the 14-year-old alone, the official took Soros with him while completing an inventory of a Jewish family's confiscated estate. Tivadar saved not only his immediate family, but also many other Hungarian Jews, and Soros later wrote that 1944 had been \"the happiest [year] of his life\", for it had given him the opportunity to witness his father's heroism.[48][49] In 1945, Soros survived the Siege of Budapest, in which Soviet and German forces fought house-to-house through the city. George and his mother also spent some time hiding with the family of Elza Brandeisz and even attended their Lutheran church with them.[50] When he was 17, Soros relocated to Paris before eventually moving to England.[51] There he became a student at the London School of Economics.[52] While a student of the philosopher Karl Popper, Soros worked as a railway porter and as a waiter, and once received £40 from a Quaker charity.[53] Soros would sometimes stand at Speakers' Corner lecturing about the virtues of internationalism in Esperanto, which he had learned from his father.[54] Soros obtained his Bachelor of Science in philosophy in 1951 and a Master of Science in philosophy in 1954 from the London School of Economics.[14] After graduating, he wanted to stay in the university and work as a professor, but his grades were not high enough, prompting him to work for an investment firm in London.[51] In a discussion at the Los Angeles World Affairs Council in 2006, Alvin Shuster, former foreign editor of the Los Angeles Times, asked Soros, \"How does one go from an immigrant to a financier? ... When did you realize that you knew how to make money?\". Soros replied, \"Well, I had a variety of jobs and I ended up selling fancy goods on the seaside, souvenir shops, and I thought, that's really not what I was cut out to do. So, I wrote to every managing director in every merchant bank in London, got just one or two replies, and eventually that's how I got a job in a merchant bank.\"[55] In 1954, Soros began his financial career at the merchant bank Singer & Friedlander of London. He worked as a clerk and later moved to the arbitrage department. A fellow employee, Robert Mayer, suggested he apply at his father's brokerage house, F.M. Mayer of New York.[56] In 1956, Soros moved to New York City, where he worked as an arbitrage trader for F. M. Mayer (1956–59). He specialized in European stocks, which were becoming popular with U.S. institutional investors following the formation of the Coal and Steel Community, which later became the Common Market.[57] In 1959, after three years at F. M. Mayer, Soros moved to Wertheim & Co. He planned to stay for five years, enough time to save $500,000, after which he intended to return to England to study philosophy.[58] He worked as an analyst of European securities until 1963. During this period, Soros developed the theory of reflexivity to extend the ideas of his tutor at the London School of Economics, Karl Popper.[59] Reflexivity posits that market values are often driven by the fallible ideas of participants, not only by the economic fundamentals of the situation. Ideas and events influence each other in reflexive feedback loops. Soros argued that this process leads to markets having procyclical \"virtuous\" or \"vicious\" cycles of boom and bust, in contrast to the equilibrium predictions of more standard neoclassical economics.[60][61] From 1963 to 1973, Soros's experience as a vice president at Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder resulted in little enthusiasm for the job; business was slack following the introduction of the Interest Equalization Tax, which undermined the viability of Soros's European trading. He spent the years from 1963 to 1966 with his main focus on the revision of his philosophy dissertation. In 1966, he started a fund with $100,000 of the firm's money to experiment with his trading strategies. In 1969, Soros set up the Double Eagle hedge fund with $4m of investors' capital including $250,000 of his own money.[62] It was based in Curaçao, Dutch Antilles.[63] Double Eagle itself was an offshoot of Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder's First Eagle fund established by Soros and that firm's chairman Henry H. Arnhold in 1967.[64][65] In 1973, the Double Eagle Fund had $12 million and formed the basis of the Soros Fund. George Soros and Jim Rogers received returns on their share of capital and 20 percent of the profits each year.[57] In 1970, Soros founded Soros Fund Management and became its chairman. Among those who held senior positions there at various times were Jim Rogers, Stanley Druckenmiller, Mark Schwartz, Keith Anderson, and Soros's two sons.[66][67][68] In 1973, due to perceived conflicts of interest limiting his ability to run the two funds, Soros resigned from the management of the Double Eagle Fund. He then established the Soros Fund and gave investors in the Double Eagle Fund the option of transferring to that or staying with Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder. It was later renamed the Quantum Fund, after the physical theory of quantum mechanics. By that time the value of the fund had grown to $12m, only a small proportion of which was Soros's own money. He and Jim Rogers reinvested their returns from the fund, and also a large part of their 20% performance fees, thereby expanding their stake.[56] By 1981, the fund had grown to $400m, and then a 22% loss in that year and substantial redemptions by some of the investors reduced it to $200m.[69] In July 2011, Soros announced that he had returned funds from outside investors' money (valued at $1 billion) and instead invested funds from his $24.5 billion family fortune, due to changes in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure rules, which he felt would compromise his duties of confidentiality to his investors. The fund had at that time averaged over 20% per year compound returns.[70] In 2013, the Quantum Fund made $5.5 billion, making it again the most successful hedge fund in history. Since its inception in 1973, the fund has generated $40 billion.[71] The fund announced in 2015 that it would inject $300 million to help finance the expansion of Fen Hotels, an Argentine hotel company. The funds will develop 5,000 rooms over the next three years throughout various Latin American countries.[72] Soros had been building a huge short position in pounds sterling for months leading up to the Black Wednesday of September 1992. Soros had recognized the unfavorable position of the United Kingdom in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. For Soros, the rate at which the United Kingdom was brought into the European Exchange Rate Mechanism was too high, their inflation was also much too high (triple the German rate), and British interest rates were hurting their asset prices.[73] By September 16, 1992, the day of Black Wednesday, Soros's fund had sold short more than $10 billion in pounds,[66] profiting from the UK government's reluctance to either raise its interest rates to levels comparable to those of other European Exchange Rate Mechanism countries or float its currency. Finally, the UK withdrew from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, devaluing the pound. Soros's profit on the bet was estimated at over $1 billion.[74] He was dubbed \"the man who broke the Bank of England\".[75] The estimated cost of Black Wednesday to the UK Treasury was £3.4 billion.[76] Stanley Druckenmiller, who traded under Soros, originally saw the weakness in the pound and stated: \"[Soros's] contribution was pushing him to take a gigantic position\".[77][78] On October 26, 1992, The New York Times quoted Soros as saying: \"Our total position by Black Wednesday had to be worth almost $10 billion. We planned to sell more than that. In fact, when Norman Lamont said just before the devaluation that he would borrow nearly $15 billion to defend sterling, we were amused because that was about how much we wanted to sell.\" Soros was believed to have traded billions of Finnish markkas on February 5, 1996, in anticipation of selling them short. The markka had been put floating as a result of the early 1990s depression. The Bank of Finland and the Finnish Government commented at the time they believed that a \"conspiracy\" was impossible.[79] During the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the prime minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad, accused Soros of using the wealth under his control to punish the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) for welcoming Myanmar as a member. With a history of antisemitic remarks, Mahathir made specific reference to Soros's Jewish background (\"It is a Jew who triggered the currency plunge\")[80] and implied Soros was orchestrating the crash as part of a larger Jewish conspiracy. Nine years later, in 2006, Mahathir met with Soros and afterward stated that he accepted that Soros had not been responsible for the crisis.[81] In 1998's The Crisis of Global Capitalism: Open Society Endangered, Soros explained his role in the crisis as follows: The financial crisis that originated in Thailand in 1997 was particularly unnerving because of its scope and severity ... By the beginning of 1997, it was clear to Soros Fund Management that the discrepancy between the trade account and the capital account was becoming untenable. We sold short the Thai baht and the Malaysian ringgit early in 1997 with maturities ranging from six months to a year. (That is, we entered into contracts to deliver at future dates Thai baht and Malaysian ringgit that we did not currently hold.) Subsequently, Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia accused me of causing the crisis, a wholly unfounded accusation. We were not sellers of the currency during or several months before the crisis; on the contrary, we were buyers when the currencies began to decline—we were purchasing ringgits to realize the profits on our earlier speculation. (Much too soon, as it turned out. We left most of the potential gain on the table because we were afraid that Mahathir would impose capital controls. He did so, but much later.)[82] In 1999, economist Paul Krugman was critical of Soros's effect on financial markets: [N]obody who has read a business magazine in the last few years can be unaware that these days there really are investors who not only move money in anticipation of a currency crisis, but actually do their best to trigger that crisis for fun and profit. These new actors on the scene do not yet have a standard name; my proposed term is \"Soroi\".[83] In an interview concerning the late-2000s recession, Soros referred to it as the most serious crisis since the 1930s. According to Soros, market fundamentalism with its assumption that markets will correct themselves with no need for government intervention in financial affairs has been \"some kind of an ideological excess\". In Soros's view, the markets' moods—a \"mood\" of the markets being a prevailing bias or optimism/pessimism with which the markets look at reality—\"actually can reinforce themselves so that there are these initially self-reinforcing but eventually unsustainable and self-defeating boom/bust sequences or bubbles\".[84] In reaction to the Great Recession, he founded the Institute for New Economic Thinking in October 2009. This is a think tank composed of international economic, business, and financial experts, who are mandated to investigate radical new approaches to organizing the international economic and financial system. In 1988, Soros was contacted by a French financier named Georges Pébereau, who asked him to participate in an effort to assemble a group of investors to purchase a large number of shares in Société Générale, a leading French bank that was part of a privatization program (something instituted by the new government under Jacques Chirac).[85] Soros eventually decided against participating in the group effort, opting to personally move forward with his strategy of accumulating shares in four French companies: Société Générale, as well as Suez, Paribas, and the Compagnie Générale d'Électricité. In 1989, the Commission des Opérations de Bourse (COB, the French stock exchange regulatory authority) conducted an investigation of whether Soros's transaction in Société Générale should be considered insider trading. Soros had received no information from the Société Générale and had no insider knowledge of the business, but he did possess knowledge that a group of investors was planning a takeover attempt. Initial investigations found Soros innocent, and no charges were brought forward.[86] However, the case was reopened a few years later, and the French Supreme Court confirmed the conviction on June 14, 2006,[87] although it reduced the penalty to €940,000.[87] Soros denied any wrongdoing, saying news of the takeover was public knowledge[88] and it was documented that his intent to acquire shares of the company predated his own awareness of the takeover.[87] In December 2006, he appealed to the European Court of Human Rights on various grounds, including that the 14-year delay in bringing the case to trial precluded a fair hearing.[89] On the basis of Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights, stating that no person may be punished for an act that was not a criminal offense at the time that it was committed, the court agreed to hear the appeal.[85] In October 2011, the court rejected his appeal in a 4–3 decision, saying that Soros had been aware of the risk of breaking insider trading laws.[90] Until the 2004 presidential election, Soros had not been a large donor to U.S. political campaigns. According to OpenSecrets, during the 2003–2004 election cycle, Soros donated $23,581,000 to various 527 Groups (tax-exempt groups under the United States tax code, 26 U.S.C. § 527). The groups aimed to defeat President George W. Bush. After Bush's reelection, Soros and other donors backed a new political fundraising group called Democracy Alliance, which supports progressive causes and the formation of a stronger progressive infrastructure in America.[91] In August 2009, Soros donated $35 million to the state of New York to be earmarked for underprivileged children and given to parents who had benefit cards at the rate of $200 per child aged 3 through 17, with no limit as to the number of children that qualified. An additional $140 million was put into the fund by the state of New York from money they had received from the 2009 federal recovery act.[53] Soros was an initial donor to the Center for American Progress, and he continues to support the organization through the Open Society Foundations. In October 2011, a Reuters story, \"Soros: not a funder of Wall Street Protests\", was published after several commentators pointed out errors in an earlier Reuters story headlined \"Who's Behind the Wall St. Protests?\" with a lead stating that the Occupy Wall Street movement \"may have benefited indirectly from the largesse of one of the world's richest men [Soros]\". Reuters's follow-up article also reported a Soros spokesman and Adbusters' co-founder Kalle Lasn both saying that Adbusters—the reputed catalyst for the first Occupy Wall Street protests—had never received any contributions from Soros, contrary to Reuters's earlier story that reported that \"indirect financial links\" existed between the two as late as 2010.[92][93] On September 27, 2012, Soros announced that he was donating $1 million to the super PAC backing President Barack Obama's reelection Priorities USA Action.[94] In October 2013, Soros donated $25,000 to Ready for Hillary, becoming a co-chairman of the super PAC's national finance committee.[95] In June 2015, he donated $1 million to the Super PAC Priorities USA Action, which supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race. He donated $6 million to the PAC in December 2015 and $2.5 million in August 2016.[96] Soros launched a new super PAC called Democracy PAC for the 2020 election cycle. By July 2019, he had donated $5.1 million to it.[97] Since 2016, Soros has been donating sums exceeding $1 million to the campaigns of progressive criminal justice reform proponents through the Safety and Justice PAC in local district attorney elections. In many districts, such large contributions were unprecedented and the campaigning strategy was \"turned on its head\" with a focus on incarceration, police misconduct and bail system, according to the Los Angeles Times.[98][99] Larry Krasner was elected as the District Attorney of Philadelphia with the help of a $1.5 million ad campaign funded by Soros in 2017.[100] Soros was the largest donor supporting the campaign of George Gascón for Los Angeles County District Attorney in 2020, contributing $2.25 million to superPACs in Gascón's favor.[101] Soros gave $2 million to a PAC supporting Kim Foxx's campaign for Cook County State's Attorney in 2020.[102] In the second quarter of 2020, Soros gave at least $500,000 to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, becoming one of the campaign's largest donors.[103] For the 2022 United States elections, Soros was the country's largest donor. He donated $128.5 million to support the Democratic Party in the election cycle.[104] According to Waldemar A. Nielsen, an authority on American philanthropy,[105] \"[Soros] has undertaken... nothing less than to open up the once-closed communist societies of Eastern Europe to a free flow of ideas and scientific knowledge from the outside world\".[106] From 1979, as an advocate of 'open societies', Soros financially supported dissidents including Poland's Solidarity movement, Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia and Andrei Sakharov in the Soviet Union.[107] In 1984, he founded his first Open Society Institute in Hungary with a budget of $3 million.[108] Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Soros's funding has played an important role in the newly independent countries. A 2017 study found that a grant program by George Soros which awarded funding to over 28,000 scientists in the former Soviet republics shortly after the end of the Soviet Union \"more than doubled publications on the margin, significantly induced scientists to remain in the science sector, and had long-lasting [beneficial] impacts\".[109] His funding of pro-democratic programs in Georgia was considered by Georgian nationalists to be crucial to the success of the Rose Revolution, although Soros has said that his role has been \"greatly exaggerated\".[110] Alexander Lomaia, secretary of the Georgian Security Council and former Minister of Education and Science, is a former executive director of the Open Society Georgia Foundation (Soros Foundation), overseeing a staff of 50 and a budget of $2.5 million.[111] Former Georgian foreign minister Salomé Zourabichvili wrote that institutions like the Soros Foundation were the cradle of democratization and that all the NGOs that gravitated around the Soros Foundation undeniably carried the revolution. She opines that after the revolution the Soros Foundation and the NGOs were integrated into power.[112] Some Soros-backed pro-democracy initiatives have been banned in Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.[113] Ercis Kurtulus, head of the Social Transparency Movement Association (TSHD) in Turkey, said in an interview 2006 that \"Soros carried out his will in Ukraine and Georgia by using these NGOs ... Last year Russia passed a special law prohibiting NGOs from taking money from foreigners. I think this should be banned in Turkey as well.\"[114] In 1997, Soros closed his foundation in Belarus after it was fined $3 million by the government for \"tax and currency violations\". According to The New York Times 1997, the Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko has been widely criticized in the West and in Russia for his efforts to control the Belarus Soros Foundation and other independent NGOs and to suppress civil and human rights. Soros called the fines part of a campaign to \"destroy independent society\".[115] In June 2009, Soros donated $100 million to Central Europe and Eastern Europe to counter the impact of the Great Recession on the poor, voluntary groups and non-government organisations.[116] Since 2012, the Hungarian Fidesz government has labelled George Soros as an enemy of the state. The government has disagreed with Soros's involvement in the 2015 European migrant crisis. The government has attacked OSF, the international civil support foundation created by George Soros, and tried to revoke the licence of Central European University (Budapest) (which failed mostly due to significant public outrage).[117] In response, Soros called the government \"a mafia state\".[118] As the 2018 election period started, the government introduced public posters with a photo of Soros[119] to create hostility in the general public towards him, using statements such as \"Soros wants millions of migrants to live in Hungary\", and \"Soros wants to dismantle the border fence\". The government also prepared a three-part law plan called the \"Stop Soros package\" (which followed other various law changes[120] in the same year, hindering the workings of several international NGOs in Hungary), which would include various steps against NGOs doing volunteer work related to the refugee crisis. In March 2017, six US senators sent a letter to then secretary of state Rex Tillerson[121] asking that he look into several grants the State Department and the US Agency for International Development (USAID) have given to groups funded by \"left-wing\" Soros. In the same context, the conservative group Judicial Watch has filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit against the U.S. Department of State and USAID compelling them to release records regarding $5 million transferred from USAID to Soros's Open Society branch in Macedonia. The suit alleges that the money was deliberately used to destabilize the Macedonian government.[122] The Open Society Foundation has said its activities in Macedonia were aimed at ethnic reconciliation with the Albanian minority and other forms of assistance since the collapse of Yugoslavia.[123] In January 2017, the \"Stop Operation Soros\" (SOS) initiative was launched in Macedonia. SOS seeks to present \"questions and answers about the way Soros operates worldwide\" and invites citizens to contribute to the research. In a press conference held during the same month, Nenad Mircevski, one of the founders of the initiative, stated that SOS would work towards the \"de-Soros-ization\" of Macedonia.[124] On May 16, 2018, Soros's Open Society Foundations announced they would move its office from Budapest to Berlin, blaming the move on an \"increasingly repressive\" environment in Hungary.[125][126][127] The Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa is a Soros-affiliated organization.[128] In November 2005, Soros said: \"My personal opinion is there's no alternative but to give Kosovo independence\".[129] Soros has helped fund the non-profit group Independent Diplomat, established by the former British diplomat Carne Ross.[130] Soros has funded worldwide efforts to promote drug policy reform. In 2008, Soros donated $400,000 to help fund a successful ballot measure in Massachusetts known as the Massachusetts Sensible Marijuana Policy Initiative which decriminalized possession of less than 1 oz (28 g) of marijuana in the state. Soros has also funded similar measures in California, Alaska, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Nevada and Maine.[131] Among the drug decriminalization groups that have received funding from Soros are the Lindesmith Center and Drug Policy Foundation.[132] Soros donated $1.4 million to publicity efforts to support California's Proposition 5 in 2008, a failed ballot measure that would have expanded drug rehabilitation programs as alternatives to prison for persons convicted of non-violent drug-related offenses.[133] In October 2010, Soros donated $1 million to support California's Proposition 19.[134] According to remarks in an interview in October 2009, it is Soros's opinion that marijuana is less addictive[compared to?] but not appropriate for use by children and students. He himself has not used marijuana for years.[135] Soros has been a major financier of the Drug Policy Alliance – an organization that promotes cannabis legalization – with roughly $5 million in annual contributions from one of his foundations.[136] The Project on Death in America, active from 1994 to 2003,[137] was one of the Open Society Institute's projects, which sought to \"understand and transform the culture and experience of dying and bereavement\".[138] In 1994, Soros delivered a speech in which he reported that he had offered to help his mother, a member of the right-to-die advocacy organization Hemlock Society, commit suicide.[139] In the same speech, he also endorsed the Oregon Death with Dignity Act,[140] proceeding to help fund its advertising campaign.[141] Because of his Jewish identity, wealth, and philanthropy, Soros has been described as \"the perfect code word\" for conspiracy theories that unite antisemitism and Islamophobia. One prominent Soros-related conspiracy theory is that he is behind the 2015 European migrant crisis or importing migrants to European countries. The Hungarian government spent millions of dollars on a poster campaign demonizing Soros. According to anthropologist Ivan Kalmar, \"Many of his most outspoken enemies inside and outside Hungary saw him as leading an international cabal that included other Jews such as the Rothschilds, as well as Freemasons and Illuminati\".[142][143] A pipe bomb was placed in the mailbox at Soros's home in Katonah, New York, on October 22, 2018, as part of the October 2018 United States mail bombing attempts. The package was discovered by a caretaker,[144] who removed it and notified authorities. It was photographed and exploded by the FBI, which launched an investigation.[145][146] For several days afterward, similar bombs were mailed to Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and other Democrats and liberals.[147] On October 26, 2018, Cesar Sayoc Jr. was arrested in Aventura, Florida, on suspicion of mailing the bombs.[148] In August 2019, Sayoc was sentenced to 20 years in prison for mailing 16 pipe bombs to 13 victims. None of the devices exploded.[149] Soros's writings focus heavily on the concept of reflexivity, where the biases of individuals enter into market transactions, potentially changing the fundamentals of the economy. Soros argues that different principles apply in markets depending on whether they are in a \"near to equilibrium\" or a \"far from equilibrium\" state. He argues that, when markets are rising or falling rapidly, they are typically marked by disequilibrium rather than equilibrium, and that the conventional economic theory of the market (the \"efficient market hypothesis\") does not apply in these situations. Soros has popularized the concepts of dynamic disequilibrium, static disequilibrium, and near-equilibrium conditions.[61] He has stated that his own financial success has been attributable to the edge accorded by his understanding of the action of the reflexive effect. Reflexivity is based on three main ideas:[61] A recent example (circa 2008) of reflexivity in modern financial markets is that of the debt and equity of housing markets.[61] Lenders began to make more money available to more people in the 1990s to buy houses. More people bought houses with this larger amount of money, thus increasing the prices of these houses. Lenders looked at their balance sheets, which not only showed that they had made more loans, but that the collaterals backing the loans – the value of the houses – had gone up (because more money was chasing the same amount of housing, relatively). Thus they lent out more money because their balance sheets looked good, and prices rose higher still. This was further amplified by public policy. In the US, home loans were guaranteed by the Federal government. Many national governments saw home ownership as a positive outcome and so introduced grants for first-time home buyers and other financial subsidies, such as the exemption of a primary residence from capital gains taxation. These further encouraged house purchases, leading to further price rises and further relaxation of lending standards. The concept of reflexivity attempts to explain why markets moving from one equilibrium state to another tend to overshoot or undershoot. Soros's theories were originally dismissed by economists,[150] but have received more attention after the 2008 crash including becoming the focus of an issue of the Journal of Economic Methodology.[151] The notion of reflexivity provides an explanation of the theories of complexity economics, as developed at the Santa Fe Institute, although Soros had not publicized his views at the time the discipline was originally developed there in the 1980s.[152][153][154] Although the primary manifestation of the reflexive process that Soros discusses is its effects in the financial markets, he has also explored its effects in politics. He has stated that whereas the greatest threats to the \"open society\" in the past were from communism and fascism (as discussed in The Open Society and Its Enemies by his mentor Karl Popper), the largest current threat is from market fundamentalism. He has suggested that the contemporary domination of world politics and world trade by the United States is a reflexive phenomenon, insofar as the success of military and financial coercion feeds back to encourage increasingly intense applications of the same policies to the point where they will eventually become unsustainable.[155] Soros argues that the current system of financial speculation undermines healthy economic development in many underdeveloped countries. He blames many of the world's problems on the failures inherent in what he characterizes as market fundamentalism.[156] Soros's book The New Paradigm for Financial Markets (May 2008), described a \"superbubble\" that had built up over the past 25 years and was ready to collapse. This was the third in a series of books he has written that have predicted disaster. As he states: I have a record of crying wolf ... I did it first in The Alchemy of Finance (in 1987), then in The Crisis of Global Capitalism (in 1998), and now in this book. So it's three books predicting disaster. [After] the boy cried wolf three times ... the wolf really came.[157] He ascribes his own success to being able to recognize when his predictions are wrong: I'm only rich because I know when I'm wrong ... I basically have survived by recognizing my mistakes. I very often used to get backaches due to the fact that I was wrong. Whenever you are wrong you have to fight or [take] flight. When [I] make the decision, the backache goes away.[157] In February 2009, Soros said the world financial system had in effect disintegrated, adding that there was no prospect of a near-term resolution to the crisis.[158] \"We witnessed the collapse of the financial system ... It was placed on life support, and it's still on life support. There's no sign that we are anywhere near a bottom.\" In January 2016, at an economic forum in Sri Lanka, Soros predicted a financial crisis akin to the 2007–2008 financial crisis based on the state of the global currency, stock and commodity markets as well as the sinking Chinese yuan.[159][160] When asked what he thought about Israel, in The New Yorker, Soros replied: \"I don't deny Jews the right to a national existence – but I don't want to be a part of it\".[161] According to hacked emails released in 2016, Soros's Open Society Foundation has a self-described objective of \"challenging Israel's racist and anti-democratic policies\" in international forums, in part by questioning Israel's reputation as a democracy.[162] He has funded NGOs which have been actively critical of Israeli policies[163][164][165] including groups that campaign for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel.[163] Speaking before a 2003 conference of the Jewish Funders Network, Soros said that the administrations of George W. Bush in the U.S. and Ariel Sharon in Israel, and even the unintended consequences of some of his own actions, were partially contributing to a new European antisemitism. Soros, citing accusations that he was one of the \"Jewish financiers\" who, in antisemitic terms, \"ruled the world by proxy\", suggested that, if the direction of those policies were changed, then anti-Semitism would diminish. Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League later said that Soros's comments held a simplistic view, were counterproductive, biased and a bigoted perception of the situation, and \"blamed the victim\" when holding Jews responsible for antisemitism. Jewish philanthropist Michael Steinhardt, who arranged for Soros's appearance at the conference, clarified that \"George Soros does not think Jews should be hated any more than they deserve to be\".[166] Soros has also said that Jews can overcome antisemitism by \"giv[ing] up on the tribalness\".[167] In a subsequent article for The New York Review of Books, Soros emphasized that: I do not subscribe to the myths propagated by enemies of Israel and I am not blaming Jews for anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism predates the birth of Israel. Neither Israel's policies nor the critics of those policies should be held responsible for anti-Semitism. At the same time, I do believe that attitudes toward Israel are influenced by Israel's policies, and attitudes toward the Jewish community are influenced by the pro-Israel lobby's success in suppressing divergent views.[168] In 2017, Israeli businessman Beny Steinmetz filed a $10-million lawsuit against Soros, alleging that Soros had influenced the government of Guinea to freeze Steinmetz's company BSG Resources out of iron ore mining contracts in the African country due to \"long-standing animus toward the state of Israel\".[169][170][171] Steinmetz claims that Soros engaged in a \"smear\" campaign against him and his companies and blames Soros for scrutiny of him by American, Israeli, Swiss, and Guinean authorities.[172] Soros called Steinmetz's suit \"frivolous and entirely false\" and said that it was \"a desperate PR stunt meant to deflect attention from BSGR's mounting legal problems across multiple jurisdictions\".[173] During an award ceremony for Imre Kertész, Soros said that the victims of violence and abuse were becoming \"perpetrators of violence\", suggesting that this model explained Israel's behavior towards the Palestinians, which led to walkouts and Soros being booed.[174] In July 2017, a Hungarian billboard campaign backed by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, which was considered to be anti-semitic by the country's Jewish groups, vilified Soros as an enemy of the state, using the slogan \"Let's not allow Soros to have the last laugh\".[175] The campaign was estimated to have cost 5.7bn forints (then US$21 million).[176] According to the Israeli ambassador, the campaign \"evokes sad memories but also sows hatred and fear\", a reference to Hungary's role in the deportation of 500,000 Jews during the Holocaust.[177] Lydia Gall of Human Rights Watch asserted that it was reminiscent of Nazi posters during the Second World War featuring \"'the laughing Jew'\".[178] Orbán and his government's representative said they had a \"zero tolerance\" of antisemitism, explaining the posters were aiming to persuade voters that Soros was a \"national security risk\".[175] Hours later, in an apparent attempt to ally Israel with Hungary, Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a \"clarification\", denouncing Soros, stating that he \"continuously undermines Israel's democratically elected governments by funding organizations that defame the Jewish state and seek to deny it the right to defend itself\".[179] Soros's son Alexander said in an interview that his father cares about Israel, and that he \"would like to see Israel in Yitzhak Rabin's image. His views are more or less the common views in Meretz and in the Labor Party.\" According to Alexander, Soros supports a two-state solution. The younger Soros recounts that after his bar mitzvah in 1998, his father told him: \"If you're serious about being Jewish, you might want to consider immigrating to Israel\".[180] In a 2018 interview with The New York Times, Alex Soros, the son of George Soros, when asked why his father fights for an open society, Soros replied that in a non-Jewish state, a Jew can only feel safe when other minorities are protected, which is one of the most important driving forces why his father has been active in his philanthropy: But he had always \"identified firstly as a Jew\", and his philanthropy was ultimately an expression of his Jewish identity, in that he felt a solidarity with other minority groups and also because he recognized that a Jew could only truly be safe in a world in which all minorities were protected. Explaining his father's motives, he said, \"The reason you fight for an open society is because that's the only society that you can live in, as a Jew—unless you become a nationalist and only fight for your own rights in your own state\".[181] In December 2023, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan, accused Soros of supporting pro-Palestinian organizations \"that seek the destruction of the State of Israel as a Jewish state\".[182] Soros' son Alexander dismissed accusations of anti-Semitism as \"distorted and dishonest right-wing attacks.\"[183] On November 11, 2003, in an interview with The Washington Post, Soros said that removing President George W. Bush from office was the \"central focus of my life\" and \"a matter of life and death\". He said he would sacrifice his entire fortune to defeat Bush \"if someone guaranteed it\".[184][185] Soros gave $3 million to the Center for American Progress, $2.5 million to MoveOn.org, and $20 million[186] to America Coming Together. These groups worked to support Democrats in the 2004 election. On September 28, 2004, he dedicated more money to the campaign and kicked off his own multistate tour with a speech, \"Why We Must Not Re-elect President Bush\",[187] delivered at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. The online transcript of this speech received many views after Dick Cheney accidentally referred to FactCheck.org as \"factcheck.com\" in the vice presidential debate, causing the owner of that domain to redirect all traffic to Soros's site.[188] His 2003 book, The Bubble of American Supremacy,[189] was a forthright critique of the Bush administration's \"War on Terror\" as misconceived and counterproductive, and a polemic against the re-election of Bush. He explains the title in the closing chapter by pointing out the parallels in this political context with the self-reinforcing reflexive processes that generate bubbles in stock prices. When Soros was asked in 2006 about his statement in The Age of Fallibility that \"the main obstacle to a stable and just world order is the United States\", he responded that \"it happens to coincide with the prevailing opinion in the world. And I think that's rather shocking for Americans to hear. The United States sets the agenda for the world. And the rest of the world has to respond to that agenda. By declaring a 'war on terror' after September 11, we set the wrong agenda for the world ... When you wage war, you inevitably create innocent victims.\"[190] In 2017, Soros described Donald Trump as a con man, and predicted Trump would fail because he believed Trump's ideas were self-contradictory.[191] Soros also said he believed Trump was preparing for a trade war and expected financial markets to do poorly.[192] In October 2011, Soros drafted an open letter entitled \"As concerned Europeans we urge Eurozone leaders to unite\",[193] in which he calls for a stronger economic government for Europe using federal means (Common EU treasury, common fiscal supervision, etc.) and warns against the danger of nationalistic solutions to the Great Recession. The letter was co-signed by Javier Solana, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, Andrew Duff, Emma Bonino, Massimo D'Alema, and Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga. In October 2015, Soros criticized Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and his handling of the 2015 European migrant crisis: \"His plan treats the protection of national borders as the objective and the refugees as an obstacle. Our plan treats the protection of refugees as the objective and national borders as the obstacle.\"[194] Soros expected that Brexit would fail and the Premiership of Theresa May would last only a short time.[192] Soros is opposed to Brexit and donated £400,000 to the anti-Brexit 'Best for Britain' group.[195] Soros also hosted a dinner for Conservative donors at his London home to encourage them to follow his lead. Soros's Open Society Foundations also donated a total of £303,000 to two pro-EU organizations, the European Movement UK and Scientists for EU, and a center-right think-tank, Bright Blue.[196] In 2018, Soros highlighted that Europe faces major challenges related to immigration, austerity, and nations leaving the EU.[197] He holds that Europe is facing an existential crisis, in view of the rise of populism, the refugee crisis and a growing rift between Europe and the United States.[198] Soros has also stated that \"the euro has many unresolved problems\" which \"must not be allowed to destroy the European Union\". He advocated replacing the notion of a multi-speed Europe by the aim of a \"multi-track Europe\" that would allow member states a wider variety of choices.[199] In view of the possibility of a further increase of the number of refugees from Africa to Europe, Soros proposes that the European Union devise a \"Marshall Plan for Africa\" (see Marshall Plan), fostering education and employment in Africa in order to reduce emigration.[197][199] Soros has expressed concern about the growth of Chinese economic and political power, saying, \"China has risen very rapidly by looking out for its own interests ... They have now got to accept responsibility for world order and the interests of other people as well\". Regarding the political gridlock in America, he said, \"Today, China has not only a more vigorous economy but actually a better functioning government than the United States\".[200] In July 2015, Soros stated that a \"strategic partnership between the US and China could prevent the evolution of two power blocks that may be drawn into military conflict\".[201] In January 2016, during an interview at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Soros stated that \"[a] hard landing is practically unavoidable\". Chinese state media responded by stating \"Soros' challenge to the RMB and Hong Kong dollar are doomed to fail, without any doubt\".[202] In January 2019, Soros used his annual speech at the World Economic Forum, in Davos, to label Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and President of China, as the \"most dangerous opponent of open societies\", saying: \"China is not the only authoritarian regime in the world but it is the wealthiest, strongest and technologically most advanced\". He also urged the United States not to allow the Chinese technology companies Huawei and ZTE to dominate the 5G telecommunications market as this would present an \"unacceptable security risk for the rest of the world\".[203][204] Soros also criticized the newest form of China's Big Brother-like system of mass surveillance called the Social Credit System, saying it would give Xi \"total control\" over the people of China.[205] Additionally, Soros is very critical of American companies that ignore Chinese human rights violations for business reasons, for example slamming BlackRock's decision to invest big in China as detrimental to worldwide democracy and US national security.[206] In May 2014, Soros told CNN's Fareed Zakaria: \"I set up a foundation in Ukraine before Ukraine became independent from Russia. And the foundation has been functioning ever since and played an important part in events now.\"[207] In January 2015, he said that \"Europe needs to wake up and recognize that it is under attack from Russia\" and urged Western countries to expand economic sanctions against Russia for its support of separatists in eastern Ukraine.[208] In January 2015, Soros called on the European Union to give $50 billion of bailout money to Ukraine.[209] In July 2015, Soros stated that Putin's annexation of Crimea was a challenge to the \"prevailing world order\", specifically the European Union. He hypothesized that Putin wants to \"destabilize all of Ukraine by precipitating a financial and political collapse for which he can disclaim responsibility, while avoiding occupation of a part of eastern Ukraine, which would then depend on Russia for economic support\".[201] In November 2015, Russia banned the Open Society Foundations (OSF) and the Open Society Institute (OSI)—two pro-democracy charities founded by Soros—stating they posed a \"threat to the foundations of the constitutional system of the Russian Federation and the security of the state\".[210][211] In January 2016, 53 books related to Soros's \"Renewal of Humanitarian Education\" program were withdrawn at the Vorkuta Mining and Economic College in the Komi Republic, with 427 additional books seized for shredding. A Russian intergovernmental letter released in December 2015 stated that Soros's charities were \"forming a perverted perception of history and making ideological directives, alien to Russian ideology, popular\". Most of these books were published with funds donated by Soros's charities.[212][213] In May 2022, Soros stated that the Russian invasion of Ukraine may be the start of \"a third world war\" and that Putin must be defeated \"as soon as possible\". He also stated that \"Other issues that concern all of humanity—fighting pandemics and climate change, avoiding nuclear war, maintaining global institutions—have had to take a back seat to that struggle. That's why I say civilization may not survive.\"[214] In February 2023, Soros criticized Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his alleged Islamophobia, cronyism and authoritarianism, saying that \"India is...a democracy. But its leader, Narendra Modi, is no democrat. Inciting violence against Muslims was an important factor in his meteoric rise.\"[215] Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party accused Soros of trying to undermine Indian democracy.[216] Indian foreign minister S. Jaishankar claimed that Soros is a \"dangerous\" person.[217] India allegedly ran a disinformation campaign against Soros.[218] As of March 2020[update], Forbes magazine listed Soros as the 162nd richest person in the world, with a net worth of $8.3 billion.[219] He has also donated 64% of his original fortune, and distributed more than $15 billion through his Open Society Foundations (an international grantmaking network that supports advancing justice, education, public health and independent media). Forbes has called him the most generous giver (when measured as a percentage of net worth).[12] Soros has been active as a philanthropist since the 1970s, when he began providing funds to help black students attend the University of Cape Town in apartheid South Africa,[107] and began funding dissident movements behind the Iron Curtain.[citation needed] Soros's philanthropic funding includes efforts to promote non-violent democratization in the post-communist states. These efforts, mostly in Central and Eastern Europe, occur primarily through the Open Society Foundations (originally Open Society Institute or OSI) and national Soros Foundations, which sometimes go under other names (such as the Stefan Batory Foundation in Poland). As of 2003, PBS estimated that he had given away a total of $4 billion.[88] The OSI says it has spent about $500 million annually in recent years. In 2003, former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker wrote in the foreword of Soros's book The Alchemy of Finance: George Soros has made his mark as an enormously successful speculator, wise enough to largely withdraw when still way ahead of the game. The bulk of his enormous winnings is now devoted to encouraging transitional and emerging nations to become \"open societies\", open not only in the sense of freedom of commerce but—more important—tolerant of new ideas and different modes of thinking and behavior.[220] Time magazine in 2007 cited two specific projects—$100 million toward Internet infrastructure for regional Russian universities, and $50 million for the Millennium Promise to eradicate extreme poverty in Africa—noting that Soros had given $742 million to projects in the U.S., and given away a total of more than $7 billion.[221] Other notable projects have included aid to scientists and universities throughout central and eastern Europe, help to civilians during the siege of Sarajevo, and Transparency International. Soros also pledged an endowment of €420 million to the Central European University (CEU). According to National Review Online[222] the Open Society Institute gave $20,000 in September 2002 to the Defense Committee of Lynne Stewart, the lawyer who has defended controversial, poor, and often unpopular defendants in court and was sentenced to 2⁠1/3⁠ years in prison for \"providing material support for a terrorist conspiracy\" via a press conference for a client. An OSI spokeswoman said \"it appeared to us at that time that there was a right-to-counsel issue worthy of our support\", but claimed later requests for support were declined.[citation needed] In September 2006, Soros pledged $50 million to the Millennium Promise, led by economist Jeffrey Sachs to provide educational, agricultural, and medical aid to help villages in Africa enduring poverty. The New York Times termed this endeavor a \"departure\" for Soros whose philanthropic focus had been on fostering democracy and good government, but Soros noted that most poverty resulted from bad governance.[223] In May 2011, Soros donated $60 million to Bard College, establishing the Bard College Center for Civic Engagement.[224] Soros played a role in the peaceful transition from communism to democracy in Hungary (1984–89)[25] and provided a substantial endowment to Central European University in Budapest.[225] The Open Society Foundations has active programs in more than 60 countries around the world with total expenditures currently averaging approximately $600 million a year.[3][226] On October 17, 2017, it was announced that Soros had transferred $18 billion to the Open Society Foundations.[227] In October 2018, Soros donated $2 million to the Wikimedia Foundation via the Wikimedia Endowment program.[228] In January 2020, Soros announced a $1 billion endowment donation at the World Economic Forum, establishing the Open Society University Network a global network of educational institutions in partnership with Bard College and the Central European University.[229] Bard College president Leon Botstein serves as chancellor of the Open Society University Network.[230] In July 2020, Soros's Foundations announced plans to give $220 million in grants for racial justice groups, criminal justice reform and civic engagement.[231] In July 2020, Soros donated $100 million to Bard College, to strengthen and expand Bard's Center for Civic Engagement initiatives, and its leadership role as a founding partner of the Open Society University Network.[232] In April 2021, Soros pledged $500 million to the endowment of Bard College. The donation sits among the largest ever made to higher education in the United States.[233] Following the $500 million donation Soros donated $25 million to the Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College in August 2021,[234] as well as an additional $25 million donation to Bard in September 2022.[235] Soros has been married three times and divorced twice. In 1960, he married Annaliese Witschak (born January 3, 1934). Annaliese was an ethnic German immigrant, who had been orphaned during the war. Although she was not Jewish, she was well-liked by Soros's parents, as she had also experienced the privation and displacement brought about by World War II.[236] They divorced in 1983. They had three children: In 1983, George Soros married Susan Weber. They divorced in 2005. They have two children: As a child, Soros fantasized about being a God.[242] In his book Underwriting Democracy, he wrote, \"If truth be known, I carried some rather potent messianic fantasies with me from childhood, which I felt I had to control, otherwise they might get me in trouble.\"[243] He later elaborated on that passage in an interview saying, \"It is a sort of disease when you consider yourself some kind of god, the creator of everything, but I feel comfortable about it now since I began to live it out.\"[244] In a 1998 interview with CBS News, Soros said he was not religious and does not believe in God.[245] In 2008, Soros met Tamiko Bolton;[246] they married on September 21, 2013.[247] His older brother, Paul Soros, a private investor and philanthropist, died on June 15, 2013.[248] As of 2022[update], Soros owned homes on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, in The Hamptons on Long Island, and in Katonah, New York, within Westchester County.[13] In December 2023, Soros was swatted during a period of similar harassment targeting American political figures.[249] Soros has received honorary doctoral degrees from the New School for Social Research in New York, the University of Oxford in 1980, the Corvinus University of Budapest, and a Doctor of Humane Letters from Yale University in 1991.[250][251] He received an honorary laurea degree in economics from the University of Bologna in 1995.[252][251] In 2005, Soros was a minority partner in a group that tried to buy the Washington Nationals, a Major League baseball team. Some Republican lawmakers suggested that they might move to revoke Major League Baseball's antitrust exemption if Soros bought the team.[253] In 2008, Soros's name was associated with AS Roma, an Italian association football team, but the club was not sold. Soros was a financial backer of Washington Soccer L.P., the group that owned the operating rights to Major League Soccer club D.C. United when the league was founded in 1995, but the group lost these rights in 2000.[254] On August 21, 2012, BBC reported SEC filings showing Soros acquired roughly a 2% stake in English football club Manchester United through the purchase of 3 million of the club's Class-A shares.[255] In 2008, Soros was inducted into Institutional Investors Alpha's Hedge Fund Manager Hall of Fame along with Alfred Jones, Bruce Kovner, David Swensen, Jack Nash, James Simons, Julian Roberston, Kenneth Griffin, Leon Levy, Louis Bacon, Michael Steinhardt, Paul Tudor Jones, Seth Klarman, and Steven A. Cohen.[256] In January 2014, Soros was ranked number 1 in LCH Investments list of top 20 managers having posting gains of almost $42 billion since the launch of his Quantum Endowment Fund in 1973.[257] In July 2017, Soros was elected an Honorary Fellow of the British Academy (HonFBA), the United Kingdom's national academy for the humanities and social sciences.[258] Soros was the Financial Times Person of the Year for 2018, with the FT describing him as \"a standard bearer for liberal democracy, an idea under siege from populists\".[259] In April 2019, Soros was awarded the Ridenhour Prize for Courage.[260] In his acceptance address Soros said: \"In my native Hungary, the government of [Prime Minister] Viktor Orbán has turned me into the super villain of an alleged plot to destroy the supposed Christian identity of the Hungarian nation... [I] donate the prize money associated with this award to the Hungarian Spectrum, an online English-language publication that provides daily updates on Hungarian politics. It renders an important service by exposing to the world [in English] what Prime Minister Viktor Orbán is telling his own people [in Hungarian]. It [Hungarian Spectrum] deserves to be better known and supported.\"[261] In January 2025, United States President Joe Biden awarded Soros the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[262]",

He has given away more than $32 billion of his personal fortune to fund the Open Society Foundations’ work around the world. He is also the founder and primary funder of the Central European University in Budapest, a leading regional center for the study of the social sciences. Under his leadership, the Open Society Foundations have supported individuals and organizations across the globe fighting for freedom of expression, accountable government, and societies that promote justice and equality. The foundations have also provided school and university fees for thousands of promising students who would otherwise have been excluded from opportunities because of their identity or where they live. This giving has often focused on those who face discrimination purely for who they are. He has supported groups representing Europe’s Roma people, and others pushed to the margins of mainstream society, such as drug users, sex workers, and LGBTI people. Soros has experienced such intolerance firsthand. Born in Hungary in 1930, he lived through the Nazi occupation of 1944–1945, which resulted in the murder of over 500,000 Hungarian Jews. His own Jewish family survived by securing false identity papers, concealing their backgrounds, and helping others do the same. Soros later recalled that “instead of submitting to our fate, we resisted an evil force that was much stronger than we were—yet we prevailed. Not only did we survive, but we managed to help others.” As the Communists consolidated power in Hungary after the war, Soros left Budapest in 1947 for London, working part-time as a railway porter and as a night-club waiter to support his studies at the London School of Economics. In 1956, he emigrated to the United States, entering the world of finance and investments, where he was to make his fortune. In 1970, he launched his own hedge fund, Soros Fund Management, and went on to become one of the most successful investors in the history of the United States. Soros used his fortune to create the Open Society Foundations—a network of foundations, partners, and projects in more than 100 countries. Their name and work reflect the influence on Soros’s thinking of the philosophy of Karl Popper, which Soros first encountered at the London School of Economics. In his book Open Society and Its Enemies, Popper argues that no philosophy or ideology is the final arbiter of truth, and that societies can only flourish when they allow for democratic governance, freedom of expression, and respect for individual rights—an approach at the core of the Open Society Foundations’ work. Soros began his philanthropy in 1979, giving scholarships to black South Africans under apartheid. In the 1980s, he helped promote the open exchange of ideas in Communist Hungary, by funding academic visits to the West, and supporting fledgling independent cultural groups and other initiatives. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, he created the Central European University as a space to foster critical thinking—at that time an alien concept at most universities in the former Communist bloc. With the Cold War over, he gradually expanded his philanthropy to the United States, Africa, Latin America, and Asia, supporting a vast array of new efforts to create more accountable, transparent, and democratic societies. He was one of the early prominent voices to criticize the war on drugs as “arguably more harmful than the drug problem itself,” and helped kick-start America’s medical marijuana movement. In the early 2000s, he became a vocal backer of same-sex marriage efforts. Though his causes evolved over time, they continued to hew closely to his ideals of an open society. His giving has reached beyond his own foundations, supporting independent organizations such as Global Witness, the International Crisis Group, the European Council on Foreign Relations, and the Institute for New Economic Thinking. Now in his 80s, Soros continues to take an active personal interest in the Open Society Foundations’ work, traveling widely to support their work and advocating for positive policy changes with world leaders both publicly and privately. In 2017, the Open Society Foundations announced that Soros had transferred $18 billion of his fortune towards funding the future work of the Foundations, bringing his total giving to the Foundations since 1984 to over $32 billion. Throughout Soros’s philanthropic legacy, one thing has remained constant: a commitment to fighting the world’s most intractable problems. He has been known to emphasize the importance of tackling losing causes. Indeed, many of the issues Soros has taken on—and he would be the first to admit this—are the types of issues for which a complete solution might never emerge. “My success in the financial markets has given me a greater degree of independence than most other people,” Soros once wrote. That independence has allowed him to forge his own path towards a world that’s more open, more just, and more equitable for all. See all Essays → See All Books → © 2025 GeorgeSoros.com.

                "title": "George Soros | Biography & Facts | Britannica Money",
                "content": "George Soros (born August 12, 1930, Budapest, Hungary) is a Hungarian-born American financier, author, philanthropist, and activist whose success as an investor made him one of the wealthiest men in the world. He is also known as a powerful and influential supporter of liberal social causes. Soros, who was born into a prosperous Jewish family, had his upbringing disrupted by the Nazis’ arrival in Hungary in 1944. The family split up and used false papers to avoid being sent to concentration camps. In 1947 they moved to London. Soros studied philosophy under Karl Popper at the London School of Economics, but he abandoned his plans to become a philosopher. He joined the London merchant bank Singer & Friedlander. In 1956 he moved to New York City, where he worked initially as an analyst of European securities and rapidly made his mark. In 1973 Soros established the Soros Fund (later Quantum Endowment Fund), a hedge fund that subsequently spawned a range of associated companies. His daring investment decisions caused the funds to grow rapidly, but not all his gambles succeeded. He correctly foresaw the worldwide stock market crash of October 1987—but wrongly predicted that Japanese stocks would fall hardest of all. Soros’s status as an almost mythical financier was established in September 1992 when the British government devalued the pound sterling. Through his Quantum group of companies, Soros had sold billions of pounds during the days preceding devaluation, much of it purchased with borrowed money. Afterward Soros bought back pounds, repaid the money he had borrowed, and made a profit of about $1 billion. Others also profited from the pound’s fall, but the scale of Soros’s operations dwarfed those of everyone else, and the gambit earned him the nickname “the man who broke the Bank of England.” In 1994, however, his instincts appeared to fail him—at least temporarily—as he speculated that the dollar would rise in value against the Japanese yen. Instead, the dollar fell all year, and the Quantum Fund reportedly lost hundreds of millions on a single day in February. Although he denied involvement in speculative attacks on the Thai baht in 1997, Soros’s name was soon linked with the financial crisis that swept Asia the following year. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad singled out Soros, stating that he was responsible for the decline of the ringgit. In reality, Soros’s funds had lost billions as a result of the crisis. Soros recovered with early gains on Internet stocks in 1999, but his investment style became more conservative in the wake of the implosion of the technology bubble in 2000. In December 2002 a French court convicted Soros of insider trading for a 1988 stock deal involving financial services company Société Générale, and he was fined €2.2 million ($2.9 million). Soros appealed the ruling, but it was upheld by the Cour de Cassation (France’s highest court) in 2006. Facing new federal regulations concerning hedge funds, Soros announced in July 2011 that the Quantum Endowment Fund would no longer manage the money of outside investors. Instead, it would only handle the assets of Soros and his family. In 1984 Soros used some of his profits to create the Open Society Foundations, a philanthropic organization that included a network of foundations. Much of the initial work focused on eastern Europe—starting with Hungary, where he awarded scholarships, provided technical assistance, and helped modernize schools and businesses. Even though Hungary was still a communist state, Soros obtained guarantees that his foundation could operate without government interference. As the Cold War ended and the Soviet regime collapsed, Soros established foundations in Czechoslovakia, Poland, Russia, and Yugoslavia. Some critics argued that he was being inconsistent—condemning “short-termism” in Western governments while making money from short-term currency speculation. However, he continued to spend significant sums to help establish democracy in eastern Europe and elsewhere. In the early 21st century Open Society Foundations was active in more than 70 countries. In 2017 it was reported that Soros had given some $18 billion to the organization in recent years, making it one of the world’s largest philanthropic groups. Soros was also involved in political activism and other philanthropic efforts. In 2003 he provided start-up funding for the liberal think tank the Center for American Progress, and he pledged millions of dollars to groups such as MoveOn.org to oppose the reelection of Pres. George W. Bush, a Republican, in 2004. He later was a prominent supporter of Democratic Sen. Barack Obama’s presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2012, and he donated to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election and to Joe Biden in 2020. In 2010 Soros gave $100 million to the nongovernmental organization Human Rights Watch. With his support of Democrats and liberal causes, Soros frequently drew criticism from Republicans and conservatives, and he was often the focus of unfounded conspiracy theories. Soros wrote several books, including The Alchemy of Finance (1987), The Crisis of Global Capitalism: Open Society Endangered (1998), and The New Paradigm for Financial Markets: The Credit Crisis of 2008 and What It Means (2008). He was the subject of the documentary Soros (2019).",

                "title": "Jimmy Carter - Wikipedia",
                "content": "James Earl Carter Jr. (October 1, 1924 – December 29, 2024) was the 39th president of the United States, serving from 1977 to 1981. A member of the Democratic Party, Carter served as the 76th governor of Georgia from 1971 to 1975 and in the Georgia State Senate from 1963 to 1967. He was the longest-lived president in U.S. history and the first to reach the age of 100. Born and raised in Plains, Georgia, Carter graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1946 and joined the United States Navy's submarine service. He married Rosalynn Smith, and they worked closely together throughout their lives. Carter returned home after his military service and revived his family's peanut-growing business. Opposing racial segregation, Carter supported the growing civil rights movement and became an activist within the Democratic Party. After serving in the Georgia State Senate and then as governor of Georgia, Carter ran for president in 1976. Initially a dark horse candidate not well known outside Georgia, he secured the Democratic nomination and selected Walter Mondale as his running mate. They narrowly defeated the Republican Party's ticket of President Gerald Ford and Senator Bob Dole. On his second day in office, Carter pardoned all Vietnam War draft evaders. He created a national energy policy that included conservation, price control, and new technology. Carter successfully pursued the Camp David Accords, the Panama Canal Treaties, and the second round of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. He also confronted stagflation. He signed into law bills that established the United States Department of Energy and the United States Department of Education. The last two years of Carter's presidency were marked by the Iran hostage crisis and an energy crisis due to the Iranian Revolution, the Three Mile Island accident, the establishment of diplomatic relations with China, the Nicaraguan Revolution, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. In response to the invasion, he escalated the Cold War by ending détente, imposing a grain embargo against the Soviets, enunciating the Carter Doctrine, and leading the multinational boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. Carter and Mondale sought re-election in 1980, and they were renominated by the Democratic Party after Carter defeated Senator Ted Kennedy in the party's primaries. They lost by a landslide to the Republican ticket of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. After Carter's presidential term ended, he established the Carter Center to promote and expand human rights; leading to him receiving a Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his work in relation to it. He traveled extensively to conduct peace negotiations, monitor elections, and further the eradication of infectious diseases. Carter was a key figure in the nonprofit housing organization Habitat for Humanity. He also wrote numerous books, ranging from political memoirs to poetry, while continuing to comment on global affairs; two of his books are about the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Polls of historians and political scientists ranked Carter's presidency to be below-average. Many generally view his post-presidency—the longest in U.S. history—more favorably. James Earl Carter Jr. was born on October 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia, at the Wise Sanitarium, where his mother worked as a registered nurse.[1] Carter thus became the first American president born in a hospital.[2] He was the eldest child of Bessie Lillian Gordy and James Earl Carter Sr., and a descendant of English immigrant Thomas Carter, who settled in the Colony of Virginia in 1635.[3][4] In Georgia, numerous generations of Carters worked as cotton farmers.[5] Plains was a boomtown of 600 people at the time of Carter's birth. His father was a successful local businessman who ran a general store and was an investor in farmland.[6] Carter's father had previously served as a reserve second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps during World War I.[6] During Carter's infancy, his family moved several times, settling on a dirt road in nearby Archery, which was almost entirely populated by impoverished African American families.[2][7] His family eventually had three more children, Gloria, Ruth, and Billy.[8] Carter had a good relationship with his parents, even though his mother was often absent during his childhood since she worked long hours. Although his father was staunchly pro-segregation, he allowed Jimmy to befriend the black farmhands' children.[9] Carter was an enterprising teenager who was given his own acre of Earl's farmland, where he grew, packaged, and sold peanuts.[10] Carter also rented out a section of tenant housing he had purchased.[2] Carter attended Plains High School from 1937 to 1941, graduating from the 11th grade; the school did not have a 12th grade.[11] By that time, Archery and Plains had been impoverished by the Great Depression, but the family benefited from New Deal farming subsidies, and Carter's father took a position as a community leader.[10][12] Carter was a diligent student with a fondness for reading.[13] According to a popular anecdote, he was passed over for valedictorian after he and his friends skipped school to venture downtown in a hot rod. Carter's truancy was mentioned in a local newspaper, although it is not clear he would otherwise have been valedictorian.[14] As an adolescent, Carter played on the Plains High School basketball team and joined Future Farmers of America, which helped him develop a lifelong interest in woodworking.[14] Carter had long dreamed of attending the United States Naval Academy.[10] In 1941, he started undergraduate coursework in engineering at Georgia Southwestern College in nearby Americus, Georgia.[15] The next year, Carter transferred to the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, where civil rights icon Blake Van Leer was president.[16] While at Georgia Tech, Carter took part in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps.[17] In 1943, he received an appointment to the Naval Academy from U.S. Representative Stephen Pace, and Carter graduated with a Bachelor of Science in 1946.[18][17] He was a good student, but was seen as reserved and quiet, in contrast to the academy's culture of aggressive hazing of freshmen.[19] While at the academy, Carter fell in love with Rosalynn Smith, a friend of his sister Ruth.[20] The two wed shortly after his graduation in 1946, and were married until her death on November 19, 2023.[21][22] Carter was a sprint football player for the Navy Midshipmen and a standout freshman cross country runner.[23][24] He graduated 60th out of 821 midshipmen in the class of 1947[a] with a Bachelor of Science degree and was commissioned as an ensign.[26] From 1946 to 1953, the Carters lived in Virginia, Hawaii, Connecticut, New York, and California, during his deployments in the Atlantic and Pacific fleets.[27] In 1948, he began officer training for submarine duty and served aboard USS Pomfret.[28] Carter was promoted to lieutenant junior grade in 1949, and his service aboard Pomfret included a simulated war patrol to the western Pacific and Chinese coast from January to March of that year.[29] In 1951, Carter was assigned to the diesel/electric USS K-1 (SSK-1), qualified for command, and served in several positions, to include executive officer.[30] In 1952, Carter began an association with the Navy's fledgling nuclear submarine program, led by then-Captain Hyman G. Rickover.[31] Rickover had high standards and demands for his men and machines, and Carter later said that, next to his parents, Rickover had the greatest influence on his life.[32] Carter was sent to the Naval Reactors Branch of the Atomic Energy Commission in Washington, D.C., for three-month temporary duty, while Rosalynn moved with their children to Schenectady, New York.[33] On December 12, 1952, an accident with the experimental NRX reactor at Atomic Energy of Canada's Chalk River Laboratories caused a partial meltdown, resulting in millions of liters of radioactive water flooding the reactor building's basement. This left the reactor's core ruined.[34] Carter was ordered to Chalk River to lead a U.S. maintenance crew that joined other American and Canadian service personnel to assist in the shutdown of the reactor.[35] The painstaking process required each team member to don protective gear and be lowered individually into the reactor for 90 seconds at a time, limiting their exposure to radioactivity while they disassembled the crippled reactor. When Carter was lowered in, his job was simply to turn a single screw.[36] During and after his presidency, Carter said that his experience at Chalk River had shaped his views on atomic energy and led him to cease the development of a neutron bomb.[37] In March 1953, Carter began a six-month course in nuclear power plant operation at Union College in Schenectady.[27] His intent was to eventually work aboard USS Seawolf, which was intended to be the second U.S. nuclear submarine.[38] His plans changed when his father died of pancreatic cancer in July, two months before construction of Seawolf began, and Carter obtained a release from active duty so he could take over the family peanut business.[39][40] Deciding to leave Schenectady proved difficult, as Rosalynn had grown comfortable with their life there.[41][42] She later said that returning to small-town life in Plains seemed \"a monumental step backward.\"[43] Carter left active duty on October 9, 1953.[44][45] He served in the inactive Navy Reserve until 1961 and left the service with the rank of lieutenant.[46] Carter's awards include the American Campaign Medal, World War II Victory Medal, China Service Medal, and National Defense Service Medal.[47] As a submarine officer, he also earned the \"dolphin\" badge.[48] After debt settlements and division of his father's estate among its heirs, Jimmy inherited comparatively little.[49] For a year, he, Rosalynn, and their three sons lived in public housing in Plains.[b] Carter was knowledgeable in scientific and technological subjects, and he set out to expand the family's peanut-growing business.[51] Transitioning from the Navy to farming was difficult as his first-year harvest failed due to a drought, and Carter had to open several bank lines of credit to keep the farm afloat.[52] Meanwhile, he took classes and studied agriculture while Rosalynn learned accounting to manage the business's books.[53] Though they barely broke even the first year, the Carters grew the business and became quite successful.[50][53] As racial tension inflamed in Plains by the 1954 Supreme Court of the United States ruling in Brown v. Board of Education,[54] Carter favored racial tolerance and integration but often kept those feelings to himself to avoid making enemies. By 1961, Carter began to speak more prominently of integration as a member of the Baptist Church and chairman of the Sumter County school board.[55][56] In 1962, he announced his campaign for an open Georgia State Senate seat 15 days before the election.[57] Rosalynn, who had an instinct for politics and organization, was instrumental to his campaign. While early counting of the ballots showed Carter trailing his opponent, Homer Moore, this was later proven to be the result of fraudulent voting. The fraud was found to have been orchestrated by Joe Hurst, the chairman of the Democratic Party in Quitman County.[57] Carter challenged the election result, which was confirmed fraudulent in an investigation. Following this, another election was held, in which Carter won against Moore as the sole Democratic candidate, with a vote margin of 3,013 to 2,182.[58] The civil rights movement was well underway when Carter took office. He and his family had become staunch supporters of John F. Kennedy. Carter remained relatively quiet on the issue at first, even as it polarized much of the county, to avoid alienating his segregationist colleagues. Carter did speak up on a few divisive issues, giving speeches against literacy tests and against an amendment to the Georgia Constitution that he felt implied a compulsion to practice religion.[59] Carter entered the state Democratic Executive Committee two years into office, where he helped rewrite the state party's rules. He became the chairman of the West Central Georgia Planning and Development Commission, which oversaw the disbursement of federal and state grants for projects such as historic site restoration.[60] When Bo Callaway was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1964, Carter immediately began planning to challenge him. The two had previously clashed over which two-year college would be expanded to a four-year college program by the state, and Carter saw Callaway—who had switched to the Republican Party—as a rival who represented aspects of politics he despised.[61] Carter was reelected to a second two-year term in the state Senate,[62] where he chaired its Education Committee and sat on the Appropriations Committee toward the end of the term. He contributed to a bill expanding statewide education funding and getting Georgia Southwestern State University a four-year program. He leveraged his regional planning work, giving speeches around the district to make himself more visible to potential voters. On the last day of the term, Carter announced his candidacy for the House of Representatives.[63] Callaway decided to run for governor instead;[64] Carter changed his mind, deciding to run for governor too.[65] In the 1966 gubernatorial election, Carter ran against liberal former governor Ellis Arnall and conservative segregationist Lester Maddox in the Democratic primary. In a press conference, he described his ideology as \"Conservative, moderate, liberal and middle-of-the-road ... I believe I am a more complicated person than that.\"[66] He lost the primary but drew enough votes as a third-place candidate to force Arnall into a runoff election with Maddox, who defeated Arnall.[67] In the general election, Republican nominee Callaway won a plurality of the vote but less than a majority, allowing the Democratic-majority Georgia House of Representatives to elect Maddox as governor.[67] This resulted in a victorious Maddox, whose victory—due to his segregationist stance—was seen as the worst outcome for the indebted Carter.[67] Carter returned to his agriculture business, carefully planning his next campaign. This period was a spiritual turning point for Carter; he declared himself a born again Christian, and his last child, Amy, was born during this time.[68][69] In the 1970 gubernatorial election, liberal former governor Carl Sanders became Carter's main opponent in the Democratic primary. Carter ran a more modern campaign, employing printed graphics and statistical analysis. Responding to polls, he leaned more conservative than before, positioning himself as a populist and criticizing Sanders for both his wealth and perceived links to the national Democratic Party. He also accused Sanders of corruption, but when pressed by the media, he did not provide evidence.[70][71] Throughout his campaign, Carter sought both the black vote and the votes of those who had supported prominent Alabama segregationist George Wallace. While he met with black figures such as Martin Luther King Sr. and Andrew Young and visited many black-owned businesses, he also praised Wallace and promised to invite him to give a speech in Georgia. Carter's appeal to racism became more blatant over time, with his senior campaign aides handing out a photograph of Sanders celebrating with Black basketball players.[70][71] Carter came ahead of Sanders in the first ballot by 49 percent to 38 percent in September, leading to a runoff election. The subsequent campaign was even more bitter. Despite his early support for civil rights, Carter's appeal to racism grew, and he criticized Sanders for supporting Martin Luther King Jr. Carter won the runoff election with 60 percent of the vote and won the general election against Republican nominee Hal Suit. Once elected, Carter changed his tone and began to speak against Georgia's racist politics. Leroy Johnson, a black state senator, voiced his support for Carter: \"I understand why he ran that kind of ultra-conservative campaign. I don't believe you can win this state without being a racist.\"[70] Carter was sworn in as the 76th governor of Georgia on January 12, 1971. In his inaugural speech, he declared that \"the time for racial discrimination is over\",[72] shocking the crowd and causing many of the segregationists who had supported him during the race to feel betrayed. Carter was reluctant to engage with his fellow politicians, making him unpopular with the legislature.[73][74] He expanded the governor's authority by introducing a reorganization plan submitted in January 1972. Despite initially having a cool reception in the legislature, the plan passed at midnight on the last day of the session.[75] Carter merged about 300 state agencies into 22, although it is disputed whether that saved the state money.[76] On July 8, 1971, during an appearance in Columbus, Georgia, he stated his intention to establish a Georgia Human Rights Council to help solve issues ahead of any potential violence.[77] In a news conference on July 13, 1971, Carter announced that he had ordered department heads to reduce spending to prevent a $57 million deficit by the end of the 1972 fiscal year, specifying that each state department would be affected and estimating that 5 percent over government revenue would be lost if state departments continued to fully use allocated funds.[78] On January 13, 1972, he requested that the state legislature fund an early childhood development program along with prison reform programs and $48 million (equivalent to $270 million in 2023) in paid taxes for nearly all state employees.[79] On March 1, 1972, Carter said he might call a special session of the general assembly if the Justice Department opted to turn down any reapportionment plans by either the House or Senate.[80] He pushed several reforms through the legislature, providing equal state aid to schools in Georgia's wealthy and poor areas, setting up community centers for mentally disabled children, and increasing educational programs for convicts. Under this program, all such appointments were based on merit rather than political influence.[81][82] In one of his more controversial decisions, he vetoed a plan to build a dam on Georgia's Flint River, which attracted the attention of environmentalists nationwide.[83][84] Civil rights were a high priority for Carter, who added black state employees and portraits of three prominent black Georgians to the capitol building: Martin Luther King Jr., Lucy Craft Laney, and Henry McNeal Turner. This angered the Ku Klux Klan.[84] He favored a constitutional amendment to ban busing for the purpose of expediting integration in schools on a televised joint appearance with Florida governor Reubin Askew on January 31, 1973,[85] and co-sponsored an anti-busing resolution with Wallace at the 1971 National Governors Conference.[86][87] After the U.S. Supreme Court threw out Georgia's death penalty statute in Furman v. Georgia (1972), Carter signed a revised death-penalty statute that addressed the court's objections, thus reintroducing the practice in the state. He later regretted endorsing the death penalty, saying, \"I didn't see the injustice of it as I do now.\"[88] Ineligible for a consecutive second term under the 1945 Georgia Constitution, Carter looked toward a potential presidential run and engaged in national politics. He was named to several southern planning commissions and was a delegate to the 1972 Democratic National Convention, where liberal U.S. Senator George McGovern was the likely nominee. Carter tried to ingratiate himself with the conservative and anti-McGovern voters. He was fairly obscure at the time, and his attempt at triangulation failed; the 1972 Democratic ticket was McGovern and senator Thomas Eagleton.[89][c] On August 3, Carter met with Wallace in Birmingham, Alabama, to discuss preventing the Democrats from losing in a landslide,[91] but they did.[92] Carter regularly met with his fledgling campaign staff and decided to begin putting a presidential bid for 1976 together. He tried unsuccessfully to become chairman of the National Governors Association to boost his visibility. On David Rockefeller's endorsement, he was named to the Trilateral Commission in April 1973. The next year, he was named chairman of both the Democratic National Committee's congressional and gubernatorial campaigns.[93] In May 1973, Carter warned his party against politicizing the Watergate scandal,[94] which he attributed to president Richard Nixon's isolation from Americans and secretive decision-making.[95] On December 12, 1974, Carter announced his presidential campaign at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. His speech contained themes of domestic inequality, optimism, and change.[96][97] Upon his entrance in the Democratic primaries, he was competing against sixteen other candidates, and was considered to have little chance against the more nationally known politicians such as Wallace.[98] His name recognition was very low, and his opponents derisively asked \"Jimmy Who?\".[99] In response to this, Carter began to emphasize his name and what he stood for, stating \"My name is Jimmy Carter, and I'm running for president.\"[100] This strategy proved successful. By mid-March 1976, Carter was not only far ahead of the active contenders for the presidential nomination, but led incumbent Republican president Gerald Ford by a few percentage points.[101] As the Watergate scandal was still fresh in the voters' minds, Carter's position as an outsider, distant from Washington, D.C. proved helpful. He promoted government reorganization. In June, Carter published a memoir titled Why Not the Best? to help introduce himself to the American public.[102] Carter became the front-runner early on by winning the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. His strategy involved reaching a region before another candidate could extend influence there, traveling over 50,000 miles (80,000 kilometres), visiting 37 states, and delivering over 200 speeches before any other candidate had entered the race.[103] In the South, he tacitly conceded certain areas to Wallace and swept them as a moderate when it became clear Wallace could not win the region. In the North, Carter appealed largely to conservative Christian and rural voters. While he did not achieve a majority in most Northern states, he won several by building the largest singular support base. Although Carter was initially dismissed as a regional candidate, he would clinch the Democratic nomination.[104] In 1980, Lawrence Shoup noted that the national news media discovered and promoted Carter, and stated: What Carter had that his opponents did not was the acceptance and support of elite sectors of the mass communications media. It was their favorable coverage of Carter and his campaign that gave him an edge, propelling him rocket-like to the top of the opinion polls. This helped Carter win key primary election victories, enabling him to rise from an obscure public figure to President-elect in the short space of 9 months.[105] During an interview in April 1976, Carter said, \"I have nothing against a community that is... trying to maintain the ethnic purity of their neighborhoods.\"[106] His remark was intended as supportive of open housing laws, but specifying opposition to government efforts to \"inject black families into a white neighborhood just to create some sort of integration\".[106] Carter's stated positions during his campaign included public financing of congressional campaigns,[107] his support for the creation of a federal consumer protection agency,[108] creating a separate cabinet-level department for education,[109] signing a peace treaty with the Soviet Union to limit nuclear weapons,[110] reducing the defense budget,[111] a tax proposal implementing \"a substantial increase toward those who have the higher incomes\" alongside a levy reduction on taxpayers with lower and middle incomes,[112] making multiple amendments to the Social Security Act,[113] and having a balanced budget by the end of his first term of office.[114] On July 15, 1976, Carter chose U.S. senator Walter Mondale as his running mate.[115] Carter and Ford faced off in three televised debates,[116] the first United States presidential debates since 1960.[116][117] For the November 1976 issue of Playboy, which hit newsstands a couple of weeks before the election, Robert Scheer interviewed Carter. While discussing his religion's view of pride, Carter said: \"I've looked on a lot of women with lust. I've committed adultery in my heart many times.\"[118][119] This response and his admission in another interview that he did not mind if people uttered the word \"fuck\" led to a media feeding frenzy and critics lamenting the erosion of boundary between politicians and their private intimate lives.[120] Carter once had a sizable lead over Ford in national polling, but by late September his lead had narrowed to only several points.[121][122] In the final days before the election, several polls showed that Ford had tied Carter, and one Gallup poll found that he was now slightly ahead.[123] Most analysts agreed that Carter was going to win the popular vote, but some argued Ford had an opportunity to win the electoral college and thus the election.[124][125] Carter and Mondale ultimately defeated Ford and his runningmate (Senator Bob Dole), receiving 297 electoral votes and 50.1% of the popular vote to Ford's 240 electoral votes and 48.0% of the popular vote.[126] Carter's victory was attributed in part[127] to his overwhelming support among black voters in states decided by close margins, such as Louisiana, Texas, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Mississippi, Wisconsin, and Ohio.[128] In Ohio and Wisconsin, where the margin between Carter and Ford was under two points, the black vote was crucial for Carter; if he had not won both states, Ford would have won the election.[128][129] Ford phoned Carter to congratulate him shortly after the race was called. He was unable to concede in front of television cameras due to bad hoarse voice, and so First Lady Betty did so for him.[130] Vice President Nelson Rockefeller oversaw the certification of election results on January 6, 1977. Although Ford carried Washington, Mike Padden, an elector from there, cast his vote for Ronald Reagan, the then-governor of California and Carter's eventual successor.[131] Preliminary planning for Carter's presidential transition had already been underway for months before his election.[132][133] Carter had been the first presidential candidate to allot significant funds and a significant number of personnel to a pre-election transition planning effort, which then became standard practice.[134] He set a mold that influenced all future transitions to be larger, more methodical and more formal than they were.[134][133] On November 22, 1976, Carter conducted his first visit to Washington, D.C. after being elected, meeting with director of the Office of Management and Budget James Lynn and United States secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld at the Blair House, and holding an afternoon meeting with President Ford at the White House.[135] The next day, he conferred with congressional leaders, saying that his meetings with cabinet members had been \"very helpful\" and that Ford had offered his assistance if he needed anything.[136] Relations between Ford and Carter were relatively cold during the transition.[137] During his transition, Carter announced the selection of numerous designees for positions in his administration.[138] A few weeks before his inauguration, Carter moved his peanut business into the hands of trustees to avoid a potential conflict of interest.[139] He also asked incoming members of his administration to divest themselves of assets through blind trusts.[140] Carter was inaugurated as the 39th president on January 20, 1977.[141] One of Carter's first acts was the fulfillment of a campaign promise by issuing an executive order declaring unconditional amnesty for Vietnam War-era draft evaders, Proclamation 4483.[142][143] Carter's tenure in office was marked by an economic malaise, a time of continuing inflation and recession and a 1979 energy crisis. Under Carter, in May 1980, the Federal Trade Commission became \"apparently the first agency ever closed by a budget dispute\", but Congress took action and the agency opened the next day.[144] Carter attempted to calm various conflicts around the world, most visibly in the Middle East with the signing of the Camp David Accords;[145] giving back the Panama Canal to Panama; and signing the SALT II nuclear arms reduction treaty with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. His final year was marred by the Iran hostage crisis, which contributed to his losing the 1980 election to Ronald Reagan.[146] Whistleblowers have alleged, most recently in 2023, that people working on the Reagan campaign's behalf convinced Iran to prolong the crisis to reduce Carter's chance of reelection.[147] Carter's presidency had a troubled economic history of two roughly equal periods. The first two years were a time of intense stagflation, primarily due to recovery from a previous recession that had left fixed investment at extreme lows and unemployment at 9%.[148] Under Carter, the unemployment rate declined from 8.1% when he took office to 5.7% by July 1978,[149][150] but during the early 1980s recession it returned to its pre-1977 level.[151] The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) measured a 6.6% unemployment rate average during the Carter administration.[152] His last two years were marked by double-digit inflation, very high interest rates,[153] oil shortages, and slow economic growth.[154] Due to economic stimulus legislation, such as the Public Works Employment Act of 1977, proposed by Carter and passed by Congress, real household median income had grown by 5.2%, with a projection of 6.4% for the next quarter.[155] The 1979 energy crisis ended this period of growth, and as inflation and interest rates rose, economic growth, job creation and consumer confidence declined sharply.[153] Federal Reserve Board chairman G. William Miller's relatively loose monetary policy had already contributed to somewhat higher inflation,[156] rising from 5.8% in 1976 to 7.7% in 1978. The sudden doubling of crude oil prices by OPEC, the world's leading oil exporting cartel,[157] forced inflation to double-digit levels, averaging 11.3% in 1979 and 13.5% in 1980.[148] The sudden shortage of gasoline as the 1979 summer vacation season began exacerbated the problem and came to symbolize the crisis to the general public;[153] the acute shortage, originating in the shutdown of Amerada Hess refining facilities, led the federal government to sue the company that year.[158] During his 1976 campaign, Carter promised to sign into law any bills Congress passed to regulate strip mining. This promise was partially in response to President Gerald Ford's having twice vetoed such bills.[159] In 1977, he signed the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, which regulated strip mining.[160] In 1978, Carter declared a federal emergency in the neighborhood of Love Canal in the city of Niagara Falls, New York. More than 800 families were evacuated from the neighborhood, which had been built on top of a toxic waste landfill. The Superfund law was created in response to the situation.[161] Federal disaster money was appropriated to demolish the approximately 500 houses, the 99th Street School, and the 93rd Street School, which had been built on top of the dump; and to remediate the dump and construct a containment area for the hazardous wastes. This was the first time that such a process had been undertaken. Carter acknowledged that several more \"Love Canals\" existed across the country, and that discovering such hazardous dumpsites was \"one of the grimmest discoveries of our modern era\".[162] Carter used the 1906 Antiquities Act and his executive order power to designate 56,000,000 acres (23,000,000 ha) of land in the state of Alaska as a national monument in December 1978. This executive order protected the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge until Congress codified it into law with the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980, which doubled the amount of public land set aside for national parks and wildlife refuges.[163][164] Moralism typified much of Carter's action.[165] On April 18, 1977, he delivered a televised speech declaring that the current energy crisis was the \"moral equivalent of war\". He encouraged energy conservation and installed solar water heating panels on the White House.[166][167] He wore a cardigan[168] to offset turning down the heat in the White House.[169] On August 4, 1977, Carter signed the Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977, forming the Department of Energy, the first new cabinet position in eleven years.[170] Carter emphasized that the House of Representatives had \"adopted almost all\" of the energy proposal he had made five months earlier and called the compromise \"a turning point in establishing a comprehensive energy program.\"[171] The following month, on October 13, Carter stated he believed in the Senate's ability to pass the energy reform bill and identified energy as \"the most important domestic issue that we will face while I am in office.\"[172] On January 12, 1978, during a press conference, Carter said the continued discussions about his energy reform proposal had been \"long and divisive and arduous\" as well as hindering to national issues that needed to be addressed with the implementation of the law.[173] In an April 11, 1978, news conference, Carter said his biggest surprise \"in the nature of a disappointment\" since becoming president was the difficulty Congress had in passing legislation, citing the energy reform bill in particular: \"I never dreamed a year ago in April when I proposed this matter to the Congress that a year later it still would not be resolved.\"[174] The Carter energy legislation was approved by Congress after much deliberation and modification on October 15, 1978. The measure deregulated the sale of natural gas, dropped a longstanding pricing disparity between intra- and interstate gas, and created tax credits to encourage energy conservation and the use of non-fossil fuels.[175] On March 1, 1979, Carter submitted a standby gasoline rationing plan per the request of Congress.[176] On April 5, he delivered an address in which he stressed the urgency of energy conservation and increasing domestic production of energy sources such as coal and solar.[177] During an April 30 news conference, he said it was imperative that the House commerce committee approve the standby gasoline rationing plan and called on Congress to pass the several other standby energy conservation plans he had proposed.[178] On July 15, 1979, Carter delivered a nationally televised address in which he identified what he believed to be a \"crisis of confidence\" among American people,[179] under the advisement of pollster Pat Caddell who believed Americans faced a crisis in confidence from events of the 1960s and 1970s, before his presidency.[180] Some later called this his \"malaise speech\",[179] memorable for mixed reactions[181][182] and his use of rhetoric.[180] The speech's negative reception centered on a view that he did not emphasize his own efforts to address the energy crisis and seemed too reliant on Americans.[183] Carter typically refused to conform to Washington's rules.[184] He avoided phone calls from members of Congress and verbally insulted them. He was unwilling to return political favors. His negativity led to frustration in passing legislation.[185] During a press conference on February 23, 1977, Carter stated that it was \"inevitable\" that he would come into conflict with Congress and added that he had found \"a growing sense of cooperation\" with Congress and met in the past with congressional members of both parties.[186] Carter developed a bitter feeling following an unsuccessful attempt at having Congress enact the scrapping of several water projects,[187] which he had requested during his first 100 days in office and received opposition from members of his party.[188] As a rift ensued between the White House and Congress afterward, Carter noted that the Democratic Party's liberal wing opposed his policies the most ardently, attributing this to Ted Kennedy's wanting the presidency.[189] Thinking he had support from 74 Congressmen, Carter issued a \"hit list\" of 19 projects that he claimed were \"pork barrel\" spending that he said he would veto if they were included in legislation.[190] He found himself again at odds with Congressional Democrats, as House Speaker Tip O'Neill found it inappropriate for a president to pursue what had traditionally been the role of Congress. Carter was also weakened by signing a bill that contained many of the \"hit list\" projects he had intended to veto.[191] In an address to a fundraising dinner for the Democratic National Committee on June 23, 1977, Carter said, \"I think it's good to point out tonight, too, that we have evolved a good working relationship with the Congress. For eight years we had government by partisanship. Now we have government by partnership.\"[192] At a July 28 news conference, assessing the first six months of his presidency, Carter spoke of his improved understanding of Congress: \"I have learned to respect the Congress more in an individual basis. I've been favorably impressed at the high degree of concentrated experience and knowledge that individual members of Congress can bring on a specific subject, where they've been the chairman of a subcommittee or committee for many years and have focused their attention on this particular aspect of government life which I will never be able to do.\"[193] On May 10, 1979, the House voted against giving Carter authority to produce a standby gas rationing plan.[194] The following day, Carter delivered remarks in the Oval Office describing himself as shocked and embarrassed for the American government by the vote and concluding \"the majority of the House Members are unwilling to take the responsibility, the political responsibility for dealing with a potential, serious threat to our Nation.\" He furthered that a majority of House members were placing higher importance on \"local or parochial interests\" and challenged the lower chamber of Congress with composing their own rationing plan in the next 90 days.[195] Carter's remarks were met with criticism by House Republicans, who accused his comments of not befitting the formality a president should have in their public remarks. Others pointed to 106 Democrats voting against his proposal and the bipartisan criticism potentially coming back to haunt him.[196] At the start of a news conference on July 25, 1979, Carter called on believers in the future of the U.S. and his proposed energy program to speak with Congress as it bore the responsibility to impose his proposals.[197] Amid the energy proposal opposition, The New York Times commented that \"as the comments flying up and down Pennsylvania Avenue illustrate, there is also a crisis of confidence between Congress and the President, sense of doubt and distrust that threatens to undermine the President's legislative program and become an important issue in next year's campaign.\"[198] In 1977, Carter appointed Alfred E. Kahn to lead the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). He was part of a push for deregulation of the industry, supported by leading economists, leading think tanks in Washington, a civil society coalition advocating the reform (patterned on a coalition earlier developed for the truck-and-rail-reform efforts), the head of the regulatory agency, Senate leadership, the Carter administration, and even some in the airline industry. This coalition swiftly gained legislative results in 1978.[199] Carter signed the Airline Deregulation Act into law on October 24, 1978. The main purpose of the act was to remove government control over fares, routes and market entry (of new airlines) from commercial aviation. The Civil Aeronautics Board's powers of regulation were to be phased out, eventually allowing market forces to determine routes and fares. The Act did not remove or diminish the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)'s regulatory powers over all aspects of airline safety.[200] In 1978, Carter signed a bill into law \"allowing homebrewing and small-scale craft brewing to operate legally\".[201] The new law deregulated the American beer industry by making it legal to sell malt, hops, and yeast to American home brewers for the first time since the 1920 beginning of prohibition in the United States.[202] This deregulation led to an increase in home brewing over the 1980s and 1990s that by the 2000s had developed into a strong craft microbrew culture in the United States, with 9,118 microbreweries, brewpubs, and regional craft breweries in the United States by the end of 2021.[203] In the late 1970s, the Chrysler Cooperation—one of the \"Big Three\" automobile manufacturers in the U.S.—faced near-certain bankruptcy as it projected a loss of $1 billion.[204] Carter proposed that the company forgo salary increases and bonuses, saying that it might be done \"without decimating the company or putting it on its knees\", but the company had already frozen wage increases and bonuses months before, to no avail.[205] In 1979, Congress began working on a bailout plan for Chrysler, led by Congressman James J. Blanchard. Carter assembled a team that included Vice President Mondale and Assistant Domestic Policy Adviser David Rubenstein to secure a $1.5 billion loan guarantee to rescue Chrysler.[206] In December, Congress passed H.R. 5860, the Chrysler Corporation Loan Guarantee Act of 1979, to bail Chrysler out with $3.5 billion (equivalent to $10.9 billion in 2023) in aid.[207] The bill turned over $162 million in stock to Chrysler's workers, eliminated around $125 million in wage increases, and gave Chrysler $500 million in bank loans.[204] Carter, who had initially opposed the bailout of corporations,[206] signed it into law in January, saying that the bill saved thousands of jobs.[204] The bailout was successful at the time, but Chrysler would eventually file for bankruptcy during the 2008 financial crisis.[206] During his presidential campaign, Carter embraced healthcare reform akin to the Ted Kennedy-sponsored bipartisan universal national health insurance.[208] Carter's proposals on healthcare while in office included an April 1977 mandatory health care cost proposal,[209] and a June 1979 proposal that provided private health insurance coverage.[210] Carter saw the June 1979 proposal as a continuation of progress in American health coverage. President Harry S. Truman proposed a designation of health care as a basic right of Americans and Medicare and Medicaid were introduced under President Lyndon B. Johnson.[211][212] The April 1977 mandatory health care cost proposal was passed in the Senate,[213] but later defeated in the House.[214] During 1978, he met with Kennedy over a compromise healthcare law that proved unsuccessful.[215] He later said Kennedy's disagreements thwarted his plan to provide a comprehensive American health care system.[216] In 1980, Carter signed into law the Mental Health Systems (MHSA) Act, which allocated block grants to states to bolster the establishment and growth of community health services and provided funding to states to create and implement community-based health services. The MHSA was considered landmark legislation in mental health care.[217] By September 1981, the Reagan administration had repealed most of the law.[218] Early into his term, Carter collaborated with Congress to fulfill his campaign promise to create a cabinet level education department. In an address from the White House on February 28, 1978, Carter argued \"Education is far too important a matter to be scattered piecemeal among various government departments and agencies, which are often busy with sometimes dominant concerns.\"[219] On February 8, 1979, the Carter administration released an outline of its plan to establish an education department and asserted enough support for the enactment to occur by June.[220] On October 17, the same year, Carter signed the Department of Education Organization Act into law,[221] establishing the United States Department of Education.[222] Carter expanded the Head Start program with the addition of 43,000 children and families,[223] while the percentage of nondefense dollars spent on education was doubled.[224] Carter was complimentary of the presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson and the 89th United States Congress for having initiated Head Start.[225] In a speech on November 1, 1980, Carter stated his administration had extended Head Start to migrant children and was \"working hard right now with Senator Bentsen and with Kika de la Garza to make as much as $45 million available in federal money in the border districts to help with the increase in school construction for the number of Mexican school children who reside here legally\".[226] During Carter's administration, the United States Foreign Service \"lifted its ban on gay and lesbian personnel\". In 1977, the Carter administration became the first U.S. presidential administration to invite gay male and lesbian rights activists to the White House to discuss federal policy with regard to ending employment discrimination in the federal government on the basis of sexual orientation and related issues (presidential advisor Midge Costanza issued the invitation).[227] From the onset of his presidency, Carter attempted to mediate the Arab–Israeli conflict.[228] After a failed attempt to seek a comprehensive settlement between the two nations in 1977 (through reconvening the 1973 Geneva conference),[229] Carter invited the Egyptian president Anwar Sadat and Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin to the presidential lodge Camp David in September 1978, in hopes of creating a definitive peace. While the two sides could not agree on Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, the negotiations resulted in Egypt formally recognizing Israel, and the creation of an elected government in the West Bank and Gaza. This resulted in the Camp David Accords, which ended the war between Israel and Egypt.[230] The accords were a source of great domestic opposition in both Egypt and Israel. Historian Jørgen Jensehaugen argues that by the time Carter left office in January 1981, he was \"in an odd position—he had attempted to break with traditional U.S. policy but ended up fulfilling the goals of that tradition, which had been to break up the Arab alliance, sideline the Palestinians, build an alliance with Egypt, weaken the Soviet Union and secure Israel.\"[231] In an address to the African officials at the United Nations on October 4, 1977, Carter stated the U.S.'s interest to \"see a strong, vigorous, free, and prosperous Africa with as much of the control of government as possible in the hands of the residents of your countries\" and pointed to their unified efforts on \"the problem of how to resolve the Rhodesian, Zimbabwe question.\"[232] At a news conference later that month, Carter said the U.S. wanted to \"work harmoniously with South Africa in dealing with the threats to peace in Namibia and in Zimbabwe in particular\", to do away with racial issues such as apartheid, and to work for equal opportunities in other facets of society in the region.[233] Despite human rights concerns, Carter continued U.S. support for Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire.[234] Zaire received nearly half the foreign aid Carter allocated to sub-Saharan Africa.[235] Under Carter an alliance with Liberia's Samuel Doe, who had come to power in a 1980 coup, was pursued.[236] Carter visited Nigeria from March 31 to April 3, 1978, to improve relations;[237] the first U.S. president to do so.[238] He reiterated interest in convening a peace conference on Rhodesia that involved all parties and said the U.S. was moving as it could.[239] The elections of Margaret Thatcher as prime minister of the United Kingdom[240] and Abel Muzorewa for Prime Minister of Zimbabwe Rhodesia,[241] South Africa turning down a plan for South West Africa's independence, and domestic opposition in Congress were seen as a heavy blow to the Carter administration's policy toward South Africa.[242] On May 16, 1979, the Senate voted in favor of lifting economic sanctions against Rhodesia, seen by some Rhodesians and South Africans as a potentially fatal blow to joint diplomacy efforts the United States and Britain had pursued in the region for three years and any compromise between the Salisbury leaders and guerrillas.[243] On December 3, Secretary of State Cyrus Vance promised Senator Jesse Helms that when the British governor arrived in Salisbury to implement an agreed Lancaster House settlement and the electoral process began, the President would take prompt action to lift sanctions against Zimbabwe Rhodesia.[244] Carter sought closer relations with the People's Republic of China (PRC), continuing the Nixon administration's drastic policy of rapprochement. The two countries increasingly collaborated against the Soviet Union, and the Carter administration tacitly consented to the Chinese invasion of Vietnam. In December 1978, he announced the United States' intention to formally recognize and establish full diplomatic relations with the PRC starting on January 1, 1979, while severing ties with Taiwan, including revoking a mutual defense treaty with the latter.[245][246] In 1979, Carter extended formal diplomatic recognition to the PRC for the first time. This decision led to a boom in trade between the United States and the PRC, which was pursuing economic reforms under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.[247] Carter supported the China-allied Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia fighting the Soviet-backed Vietnamese invasion.[248] After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Carter allowed the sale of military supplies to China and began negotiations to share military intelligence.[249] In January 1980, Carter unilaterally revoked the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty with the Republic of China (ROC), which had lost control of mainland China to the PRC in 1949, but retained control of the island of Taiwan. Conservative Republicans challenged Carter's abrogation of the treaty in court, but the Supreme Court ruled that the issue was a non-justiciable political question in Goldwater v. Carter. The U.S. continued to maintain diplomatic contacts with the ROC through the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act.[250] During Carter's presidency, the U.S. continued to support Indonesia under Suharto as a cold war ally, despite human rights violations in East Timor. The violations followed Indonesia's December 1975 invasion and occupation of East Timor. Under Carter's administration military assistance to Indonesia increased, peaking in 1978.[251][252] This was antithetical to Carter's stated policy of \"not selling weapons if it would exacerbate a potential conflict in a region of the world\".[253][254] During a news conference on March 9, 1977, Carter reaffirmed his interest in having a gradual withdrawal of American troops from South Korea and said he wanted South Korea to eventually have \"adequate ground forces owned by and controlled by the South Korean government to protect themselves against any intrusion from North Korea.\"[255] On May 19, The Washington Post quoted Chief of Staff of U.S. forces in South Korea John K. Singlaub as criticizing Carter's withdrawal of troops from the Korean peninsula. Later that day, Press Secretary Rex Granum announced that Carter had summoned Singlaub to the White House, and confirmed that Carter had seen the Washington Post article.[256] Carter relieved Singlaub of his duties on May 21 after a meeting between the two.[257][258] During a news conference on May 26, 1977, Carter said South Korea could defend itself with reduced American troops in case of conflict.[259] From June 30 to July 1, 1979, Carter held meetings with president of South Korea Park Chung Hee at the Blue House for a discussion on relations between the U.S. and South Korea as well as Carter's interest in preserving his policy of worldwide tension reduction.[260] On April 21, 1978, Carter announced a reduction in American troops in South Korea scheduled to be released by the end of the year by two-thirds, citing lack of action by Congress in regard to a compensatory aid package for the South Korean government.[261] He supported South Korean President Chun Doo-hwan during the suppression of the Gwangju Uprising in May 1980.[262] South Korean pro-democracy activist Kim Dae-jung was sentenced to death in September 1980, but his sentence was commuted after the intervention of Presidents Carter and Reagan.[263] On November 15, 1977, Carter pledged that his administration would continue positive relations between the U.S. and Iran, calling its contemporary status \"strong, stable and progressive\".[264] On December 31, 1977, he called Iran under the Shah an \"island of stability\" made possible by the \"admiration and love your people give to [the Shah]\".[265][266] Carter praised the Shah's \"great leadership\" and spoke of \"personal friendship\" between them.[267] American support for the unpopular Shah increased anti-American sentiment in Iran, which intensified after the Shah, who was dying of cancer, left Iran for the last time in January 1979 and Carter allowed him to be admitted to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York on October 22, 1979.[268] On November 4, 1979, a group of Iranian students took over the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. The students belonged to the Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line and supported the Iranian Revolution.[269] Fifty-two American diplomats and citizens were held hostage for the next 444 days. They were freed immediately after Ronald Reagan succeeded Carter as president on January 20, 1981. During the crisis, Carter remained in isolation in the White House for more than 100 days, until he left to participate in the lighting of the National Menorah on the Ellipse.[270] A month into the affair, Carter announced his commitment to resolving the dispute without \"any military action that would cause bloodshed or arouse the unstable captors of our hostages to attack them or to punish them\".[271] On April 7, 1980, he issued Executive Order 12205, imposing economic sanctions against Iran,[272] and announced further government measures he deemed necessary to ensure a safe release.[273][274] On April 24, 1980, Carter ordered Operation Eagle Claw to try to free the hostages. The mission failed, leaving eight American servicemen dead and two aircraft destroyed.[275][276] The failure led Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, who had opposed the mission, to resign.[277] Released in 2017, a declassified memo produced by the CIA in 1980 concluded \"Iranian hardliners—especially Ayatollah Khomeini\" were \"determined to exploit the hostage issue to bring about President Carter's defeat in the November elections.\" Additionally, Tehran in 1980 wanted \"the world to believe that Imam Khomeini caused President Carter's downfall and disgrace.\"[278] On February 8, 1977, Carter said he had urged the Soviet Union to align with the U.S. in forming \"a comprehensive test ban to stop all nuclear testing for at least an extended period of time\", and that he was in favor of the Soviet Union ceasing deployment of the RSD-10 Pioneer.[279] During a June 13 press conference, he said that at the beginning of the week, the U.S. would \"work closely with the Soviet Union on a comprehensive test ban treaty to prohibit all testing of nuclear devices underground or in the atmosphere\", and Paul Warnke would negotiate demilitarization of the Indian Ocean with the Soviet Union beginning the following week.[280] At a December 30 news conference, Carter said that during \"the last few months, the United States and the Soviet Union have made great progress in dealing with a long list of important issues, the most important of which is to control the deployment of strategic nuclear weapons\", and that the two countries sought to conclude SALT II talks by the spring of the next year.[281] The talk of a comprehensive test ban treaty materialized with the signing of the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty II by Carter and Leonid Brezhnev on June 18, 1979.[282][283] In 1979, the Soviets intervened in the Second Yemenite War. The Soviet backing of South Yemen constituted a \"smaller shock\", in tandem with tensions that were rising due to the Iranian Revolution. This played a role in making Carter's stance on the Soviet Union more assertive, a shift that finalized with the impending Soviet-Afghan War.[284] In his 1980 State of the Union Address, Carter emphasized the significance of relations between the two regions: \"Now, as during the last 3½ decades, the relationship between our country, the United States of America, and the Soviet Union is the most critical factor in determining whether the world will live at peace or be engulfed in global conflict.\"[285] Communists under the leadership of Nur Muhammad Taraki seized power in Afghanistan on April 27, 1978.[286] The new regime signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union in December of that year.[286][287] Due to the regime's improvement of secular education and redistribution of land coinciding with mass executions and political oppression, Taraki was deposed by rival Hafizullah Amin in September.[286][287][288] Amin was considered a \"brutal psychopath\" by foreign observers and had lost control of much of the country, prompting the Soviet Union to invade Afghanistan on December 24, 1979, execute Amin, and install Babrak Karmal as president.[286][287] In the West, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was considered a threat to global security and the oil supplies of the Persian Gulf, as well as the existence of Pakistan.[287][289] These concerns led Carter to expand collaboration between the CIA and Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), which had begun in July 1979, when the CIA started providing $695,000 worth of non-lethal assistance (e.g., \"cash, medical equipment, and radio transmitters\") to the Afghan mujahideen.[290] The modest scope of this early collaboration was likely influenced by the understanding, later recounted by CIA official Robert Gates, \"that a substantial U.S. covert aid program\" might have \"raise[d] the stakes\", thereby causing \"the Soviets to intervene more directly and vigorously than otherwise intended.\"[289][291] According to a 2020 review of declassified U.S. documents by Conor Tobin in the journal Diplomatic History: \"The primary significance of this small-scale aid was in creating constructive links with dissidents through Pakistan's ISI that could be utilized in the case of an overt Soviet intervention ... The small-scale covert program that developed in response to the increasing Soviet influence was part of a contingency plan if the Soviets did intervene militarily, as Washington would be in a better position to make it difficult for them to consolidate their position, but not designed to induce an intervention.\"[290] On December 28, 1979, Carter signed a presidential finding explicitly allowing the CIA to transfer \"lethal military equipment either directly or through third countries to the Afghan opponents of the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan\" and to arrange \"selective training, conducted outside of Afghanistan, in the use of such equipment either directly or via third country intermediation.\"[290] His finding defined the CIA's mission as \"harassment\" of Soviet troops; at the time, \"this was not a war the CIA expected to win outright on the battlefield,\" in the words of Steve Coll.[292] Carter was determined to respond harshly to what he considered a dangerous provocation. In a televised speech on January 23, 1980, he announced sanctions on the Soviet Union, promised renewed aid and registration to Pakistan and the Selective Service System, and committed the U.S. to the Persian Gulf's defense.[289][291][293][294] Carter imposed an embargo on grain shipments to the USSR, tabled SALT II, requested a 5% annual increase in defense spending,[295][296] and called for a boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, which was ultimately joined by 65 other nations.[297][298][299] British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher enthusiastically backed Carter's tough stance.[289] National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski played a major role in organizing Carter's policies on the Soviet Union as a grand strategy.[300] In early 1980, Carter determined the thrust of U.S. policy for the duration of the war: he initiated a program to arm the mujahideen through Pakistan's ISI and secured a pledge from Saudi Arabia to match U.S. funding for this purpose. Despite huge expenditure, the Soviet Union was unable to quell the insurgency and withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989 amid the economic, political, and social turmoil within the USSR, precipitating its collapse two years later.[301][289] The routing of U.S. aid through Pakistan led to some controversy, as weapons sent to Karachi were frequently controlled by Pakistan, whose government influenced which rebels received assistance. Despite this, Carter has expressed no regret over his decision to support what he still considers the Afghan freedom fighters.[289] Carter made twelve international trips to 25 countries as president.[302] He was the first president to make a state visit to Sub-Saharan Africa when he went to Nigeria in 1978.[238] His travel also included trips to Europe, Asia, and Latin America. He made several trips to the Middle East to broker peace negotiations. His visit to Iran from December 31, 1977, to January 1, 1978, took place less than a year before the overthrow of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.[303] Carter gave his \"Island of Stability\" speech during this visit. The September 21, 1977, resignation of Bert Lance, who was director of the Office of Management and Budget in the Carter administration, occurred amid allegations of improper banking activities before his tenure and was an embarrassment to Carter.[304] He became the first sitting president to testify under oath as part of an investigation of him,[305][306] as a result of United States Attorney General Griffin Bell appointing Paul J. Curran as a special counsel to investigate loans made to the peanut business Carter owned by a bank controlled by Lance and Curran's position as special counsel not allowing him to file charges on his own.[307][d] Curran announced in October 1979 that no evidence had been found to support allegations that funds loaned from the National Bank of Georgia had been diverted to Carter's 1976 presidential campaign, ending the investigation.[308] Carter's reelection campaign was based primarily on attacking Ronald Reagan. The campaign frequently pointed out and mocked Reagan's proclivity for gaffes, using his age and perceived lack of connection to his native California voter base against him.[309] Later, the campaign used similar rhetoric as Lyndon Johnson's 1964 presidential campaign, portraying Reagan as a warmonger who could not be trusted with the nuclear arsenal.[310] Carter attempted to deny the Reagan campaign $29.4 million (equivalent to $91 million in 2023) in campaign funds, due to dependent conservative groups already raising $60 million to get him elected—an amount that exceeded the limit of campaign funds. Carter's attempt was later denied by the Federal Election Commission.[311] Carter announced his reelection campaign in December 1979.[312] A month earlier, Senator Ted Kennedy had announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination.[313] During the Democratic presidential primaries, questions about Kennedy were a frequent subject of Carter's press conferences.[314][315] Despite winning key states such as California and New York, Kennedy surprised his supporters by running a weak campaign. Carter won most of the primaries and secured renomination. He later wrote that the strongest opposition to his policies came from the Democratic Party's liberal wing, which he attributed to Kennedy's ambition to replace him as president.[316] Kennedy had mobilized the liberal wing, which weakened Carter's support in the general election.[317] Carter and Mondale were formally nominated at the 1980 Democratic National Convention in New York City.[318] Carter delivered a speech notable for its tribute to the late Hubert Humphrey, whom he initially called \"Hubert Horatio Hornblower\",[319] and Kennedy made \"The Dream Shall Never Die\" speech, in which he criticized Reagan and did not endorse Carter.[320] Along with Reagan and Kennedy, Carter was opposed by centrist John B. Anderson, who had previously contested the Republican presidential primaries, and upon losing to Reagan, reentered the race as an independent. Anderson advertised himself as a more liberal alternative to Reagan's conservatism.[321] As the campaign went on, Anderson's polling numbers dropped and his base was gradually pulled to Carter or Reagan.[322] Carter had to run against his own \"stagflation\"-ridden economy, while the hostage crisis in Iran dominated the news every week. He was attacked by conservatives for failing to \"prevent Soviet gains\" in less-developed countries, as pro-Soviet governments had taken power in countries including Angola, Ethiopia, Nicaragua and Afghanistan.[323] His brother, Billy Carter, caused controversy due to his association with Muammar Gaddafi's regime in Libya.[324] Carter alienated many liberal college students, who were expected to be one of his strongest support bases, by reactivating the Selective Service System on July 2, 1980, reinstating registration for the military draft. His campaign manager and former appointments secretary, Timothy Kraft, stepped down five weeks before the general election amid what turned out to be an uncorroborated allegation of cocaine use.[325] On October 28, Carter and Reagan participated in the sole presidential debate of the election cycle in which they were both present, due to Carter refusing to participate in debates that included Anderson.[326] Though initially trailing Carter by several points,[327] Reagan experienced a surge in polling after the debate.[328] This was in part influenced by Reagan deploying the phrase \"There you go again\", which became the election's defining phrase.[329] It was later discovered that in the final days of the campaign, Reagan's team acquired classified documents Carter used to prepare for the debate.[330] Reagan and his running mate (George H. W. Bush) defeated Carter and Mondale in a landslide, winning 489 electoral votes. The Senate went Republican for the first time since 1952.[331] In his concession speech, Carter admitted that he was hurt by the outcome of the election but pledged \"a very fine transition period\" with President-elect Reagan.[332] Shortly after losing reelection, Carter told the White House press corps that he intended to emulate the retirement of Harry S. Truman and not use his subsequent public life to enrich himself.[333] Diplomacy was a large part of Carter's post-presidency. These diplomatic efforts began in the Middle East, with a September 1981 meeting with prime minister of Israel Menachem Begin,[334] and a March 1983 tour of Egypt that included meeting with members of the Palestine Liberation Organization.[335] In 2018, official files revealed that, in January 1993, Carter had been suggested for a Northern Ireland peace process role by president-elect Bill Clinton amid speculation that Clinton would appoint a special envoy for Northern Ireland.[336] In 1994, Clinton sought Carter's assistance in a North Korea peace mission, during which Carter negotiated an understanding with Kim Il Sung.[337][338] Carter outlined a treaty with Kim, which he announced to CNN without the Clinton administration's consent to spur American action.[339] In March 1999, Carter visited Taiwan and met with President Lee Teng-hui. During the meeting, Carter praised the progress Taiwan made in democracy, human rights, economy, culture, science and technology.[340] However, even at the time of his death, Carter remained a controversial figure in Taiwan for having ended US diplomatic relations with the Republic of China (Taiwan).[341] In 2003, Carter championed a plan to hold elections in Venezuela amid protests aimed at doing so.[342] Ultimately, no elections were held. In 2006, Carter stated his disagreements with Israel's domestic and foreign policy while saying he supported the country,[343][344] extending his criticisms to Israel's policies in Lebanon, the West Bank, and Gaza.[345] In July 2007, Carter joined Nelson Mandela in Johannesburg, South Africa, to announce his participation in The Elders, a group of independent global leaders who work together on peace and human rights issues.[346][347] After the announcement, Carter participated in visits to Darfur,[348] Sudan,[349][350] Cyprus, the Korean Peninsula, and the Middle East, among others.[351] He attempted to travel to Zimbabwe in November 2008, but was stopped by President Robert Mugabe's government.[352] In December 2008, Carter met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad,[353][354] and in a June 2012 call with Jeffery Brown, stressed that Egyptian military generals could take full executive and legislative power to form a new constitution favoring themselves if their announced intentions came true.[355] On August 10, 2010, Carter traveled to North Korea to secure the release of Aijalon Gomes, successfully negotiating his release.[356][357] Throughout the latter part of 2017, as tensions between the U.S. and North Korea persisted, Carter recommended a peace treaty between the two nations,[358] and confirmed that he had volunteered to the Trump administration to be a diplomatic envoy to North Korea.[359] Carter began his first year out of office with a pledge not to critique the Reagan administration, saying it was \"too early\".[360] He sided with Reagan on issues like building neutron arms after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan,[361] but frequently spoke out against his administration, denouncing many of its actions in the Middle East;[362] in 1987, Carter said that Reagan was incapable of preserving peace in the Middle East.[363] He condemned the handling of the Sabra and Shatila massacre,[364] the lack of efforts to rescue and retrieve four American businessmen from West Beirut in 1984,[365] Reagan's support of the Strategic Defense Initiative in 1985,[366] and his claim of an international conspiracy on terrorism.[367] In 1987 he criticized Reagan for conceding to terrorist demands,[368] nominating Robert Bork for the Supreme Court,[369] and his handling of the Persian Gulf crisis.[370] On January 16, 1989, before the inauguration of George H. W. Bush, Carter told Gerald Ford that Reagan had experienced a media honeymoon, saying that he believed Reagan's immediate successor would be less fortunate.[371] Carter had a mostly poor relationship with Bill Clinton, who snubbed him from his inauguration ceremony. He doubted the morality of the Clinton administration, particularly with respect to the Monica Lewinsky scandal and the pardon of Marc Rich.[372] In July 2001, Carter said he was \"disappointed in almost everything\" President George W. Bush had done, but after the September 11 attacks, he offered only praise, calling on Americans to support Bush with \"complete unity\".[373] Later, Carter opposed the Iraq War[374] and what he considered an attempt by Bush and Tony Blair to oust Saddam Hussein with \"lies and misinterpretations\".[375] In 2004, Carter said that he believed Bush exploited the September 11 attacks and blamed the media for not criticizing him.[376] In 2007, Carter said the Bush administration \"has been the worst in history\" on foreign affairs;[377] he later said he was just comparing Bush's tenure to Nixon's.[378] Tony Fratto responded to Carter's comments on the Bush administration's behalf by saying that the comments increased Carter's irrelevance.[379] By the end of Bush's second term, Carter considered Bush's tenure disappointing, as he told Forward Magazine of Syria.[380] Though he praised President Barack Obama in the early part of his tenure,[381] Carter stated his disagreement with using drone strikes against suspected terrorists, Obama's choice to keep Guantanamo Bay detention camp open,[382] and the federal surveillance programs Edward Snowden revealed.[383][384] During Donald Trump's presidency, Carter spoke favorably of the chance for immigration reform[385] and criticized Trump for his handling of the U.S. national anthem protests.[386] In October 2017, he defended Trump in an interview with The New York Times, criticizing the media's coverage of him as harsher \"than any other president certainly that I've known about\".[387][388] In 2019, Trump called Carter and expressed concern that China was \"getting ahead\" of the United States. Carter agreed, saying that China's strength came from its lack of involvement in armed conflict and calling the U.S. \"the most warlike nation in the history of the world.\"[389] Carter gave his final recorded interview in July 2021, in which he expressed his view that President Joe Biden \"has done very well\" in office.[390] Carter was considered a potential candidate in the 1984 presidential election.[391][392] In May 1982, Carter ruled out another run, and instead endorsed Mondale for the Democratic presidential nomination.[393] After Mondale secured the nomination in the Democratic primaries, Carter critiqued the Reagan campaign,[394] spoke at the 1984 Democratic National Convention, and advised Mondale about his campaign.[395] After the election, in which Reagan defeated Mondale, Carter said the loss was predictable because Mondale's platform included raising taxes.[396] In March 1987, Carter ruled himself out as a candidate in the 1988 presidential election and predicted that Vice President George H. W. Bush would be the Republican nominee.[397] Ahead of the 1988 Democratic National Convention, Carter predicted that the convention would see party unity[398] after tensions arose between presumptive nominee Michael Dukakis and runner-up Jesse Jackson.[399] Carter delivered an address at the convention.[400] After Bush won the election, Carter predicted that Bush's presidency would be more challenging than Reagan's had been, because Bush was not as popular as Reagan.[401] During the 1992 presidential election, Carter met with Senator Paul Tsongas, who sought his advice.[402] Carter spoke favorably of former governor of Arkansas Bill Clinton,[403] and criticized Ross Perot, a Texas billionaire who was running as an independent.[404] As the primary concluded, Carter spoke of the need for the 1992 Democratic National Convention to address certain issues not focused on in the past,[405] and campaigned for Clinton after he became the Democratic nominee,[406] publicly stating his expectation to be consulted during Clinton's presidency.[407] Carter endorsed Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic nominee, days before the 2000 presidential election,[408] and in subsequent years voiced his opinion that Gore won the election,[409] despite Republican nominee George W. Bush having been certified the victor following the Supreme Court's ruling in Bush v. Gore.[410] In the 2004 presidential election, Carter endorsed the Democratic nominee John Kerry and spoke at the 2004 Democratic National Convention.[411] He also voiced concern about another voting mishap in Florida.[412] During the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries, it was speculated that Carter would endorse Barack Obama over his main primary rival Hillary Clinton, as Carter and other members of the Carter family had spoken favorably of Obama.[413][414] Although he did not endorse Obama during the primaries, he said in late May 2008 that Clinton should end her bid and concede to Obama after the final primaries on June 3. Carter predicted that quickly after the June 3 primaries, enough superdelegates would publicly declare their intentions to vote to nominate Obama to make him the presumptive nominee.[415] On June 3, endorsed Obama, and disclosed that he would be casting his vote for Obama as a superdelegate to the 2008 Democratic National Convention[416] (as a former president, Carter was entitled to hold one of 20 superdelegate slots reserved for \"distinguished party leaders\").[417] Before this, he had remained officially neutral, having avoided making any unambiguous declarations of support for Obama.[416] During the election campaign, Carter criticized John McCain, the Republican nominee.[418][419] Once Obama became the presumptive nominee, he advised that Obama should not select Clinton as his running mate.[420] Ahead of the primaries of the 2012 presidential election, Carter expressed his preference for Republican Mitt Romney to win the Republican nomination, though he clarified that his preference of Romney was because he believed him to be the prospective Republican nominee that would most assure a re-election victory for President Obama.[421] Carter pre-recorded an address that was shown at the 2012 Democratic National Convention.[422] For the 2016 presidential election, Carter was critical of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump shortly after the latter entered the primary, predicting that he would lose.[423][424] As the primary continued, Carter said he would prefer Trump over his main rival, Ted Cruz,[425] though he rebuked the Trump campaign during the primary[426] and in his address to the 2016 Democratic National Convention.[427] In August 2016, Carter endorsed the presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.[428] He again expressed his backing of Clinton in his speech to the Democratic convention, which he delivered by video (as opposed to speaking inside the convention hall itself).[427][429] In 2019, Carter charged that Trump would not have been elected without Russia's interference in the 2016 election,[430] and \"that Trump didn't actually win the election in 2016. He lost the election, and he was put into office because the Russians interfered on his behalf.\" When questioned, he agreed that Trump is an \"illegitimate president\".[431][432] In a 2017 discussion with Senator Bernie Sanders, Carter revealed he voted for Sanders in the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries.[433] Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter delivered a recorded audio message endorsing Joe Biden for the virtual 2020 Democratic National Convention. On January 6, 2021, following the U.S. Capitol attack, along with the other three still living former presidents, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton,[434] Jimmy Carter denounced the attack, releasing a statement saying that he and his wife were \"troubled\" by the events, also stating that what had occurred was \"a national tragedy and is not who we are as a nation\", and adding that \"having observed elections in troubled democracies worldwide, I know that we the people can unite to walk back from this precipice to peacefully uphold the laws of our nation\".[435] Carter delivered a recorded audio message for the inauguration of Joe Biden on January 20, 2021, as the Carters were unable to attend the ceremony in person.[436] In November 2022, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overruled a three-judge panel of the court and scheduled a rehearing of the case against the Trump administration-proposed land swap in Alaska to allow a road through the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge. In an unusual action, Carter had filed an opinion in support of the suit by environmental groups, saying the swap violated the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (Anilca) passed in 1980 near the end of Carter's term. Carter said the act \"may be the most significant domestic achievement of my political life\" at the time of his filing.[437] In August 2024, Carter's son Chip said his father wanted to live to 100 to vote for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.[438] He achieved this on October 16, the second day of early voting in Georgia.[439][440] Carter criticized the Bush administration's handling of Hurricane Katrina,[441] and built homes in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.[442] He also partnered with former presidents to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities,[443] in addition to writing op-eds about the goodness seen in Americans who assist each other during natural disasters.[444] The Carter family experienced another dilemma when its peanut business accumulated a $1 million debt in 1981. Carter began writing books to pay off this debt. As of July 2019, he had \"published more than 30, from a children's book to reflections on his presidency\".[445] After he left the White House, \"[o]n average, he completed just about one book per year over those 35 years, including many bestsellers, a novel and a children's book.\"[446] In 1982, Carter founded the Carter Center,[447] a non-governmental and nonprofit organization with the purpose of advancing human rights and alleviating human suffering,[448] including helping improve the quality of life for people in more than 80 countries.[449] Among these efforts has been working with the World Health Organization to eradicate dracunculiasis, also called Guinea worm disease. The incidence of this disease has decreased from 3.5 million cases in the mid-1980s to 25 cases in 2016,[450][451] and four in the first seven months of 2024, according to the Carter Center's statistics.[452] Carter attended the dedication of his presidential library[453] and those of Presidents Ronald Reagan,[454] George H. W. Bush,[455] Bill Clinton,[456][457] and George W. Bush.[458] He delivered eulogies at the funerals of Coretta Scott King,[459] Gerald Ford,[460][461] and Theodore Hesburgh.[462] In 2007, Carter founded the New Baptist Covenant organization for social justice.[463][464] As of August 2019[update], Carter was Honorary Chair of the World Justice Project.[465] He was formerly an honorary chair of the Continuity of Government Commission.[466] He continued to occasionally teach Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist Church as of 2019.[467] Carter also taught at Emory University, and in 2019 was awarded tenure for 37 years of service.[468] Carter's 2006 book Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid, a New York Times Best Seller, generated controversy for characterizing Israel's policies in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip as amounting to apartheid.[469] In an interview, Carter defined apartheid as the \"forced separation of two peoples in the same territory with one of the groups dominating or controlling the other\".[470] In remarks broadcast over radio, he said that Israel's policies amounted to an apartheid worse than South Africa's:[471] When Israel does occupy this territory deep within the West Bank, and connects the 200 or so settlements with each other, with a road, and then prohibits the Palestinians from using that road, or in many cases even crossing the road, this perpetrates even worse instances of apartness, or apartheid, than we witnessed even in South Africa.[471] Carter defended himself against accusations of antisemitism by saying \"the hope is that my book will at least stimulate a debate, which has not existed in this country. There's never been any debate on this issue of any significance.\"[471] He said that Israel would not have peace until it agreed to withdraw from the occupied territories, adding, \"the greatest commitment in my life has been trying to bring peace to Israel.\"[471] In a 2007 speech at Brandeis University, Carter apologized for wording in the book that suggested that Palestinian suicide terror attacks were justified as a political tool. \"That sentence was worded in a completely improper and stupid way. I've written my publishers to change that sentence immediately in future editions of the book. I apologize to you personally and to everyone here.\"[472][473][474][475] In his 2010 book We Can Have Peace in the Holy Land, Carter cites Israel's unwillingness to withdraw from the occupied Palestinian territories and settlement expansion as the primary obstacle to peace in the Middle East.[476] Carter refused to be interviewed by the Atlanta Jewish Times because it called him a parasite in a 2015 editiorial.[477] Carter's hobbies included painting,[478] fly fishing, woodworking, cycling, tennis, and skiing.[479] He also had an interest in poetry, particularly the works of Dylan Thomas.[480] During a state visit to the UK in 1977, Carter suggested that Thomas should have a memorial in Poets' Corner at Westminster Abbey;[481] this came to fruition in 1982.[480][482] In 1994, Carter published a book of poetry, Always a Reckoning and Other Poems, illustrated by his granddaughter Sarah Chuldenko.[483] Carter was a personal friend of Elvis Presley, whom he and Rosalynn met on June 30, 1973, before Presley was to perform onstage in Atlanta.[484] They remained in contact by telephone two months before Presley's sudden death in August 1977. Carter later recalled an abrupt phone call received in June 1977 from Presley who sought a presidential pardon from Carter, to help George Klein's criminal case; at the time Klein had been indicted for only mail fraud, and was later found guilty of conspiracy.[485][486] According to Carter, Presley was almost incoherent because of barbiturates; although he phoned the White House several times again, this was the last time they spoke.[487] The day after Presley's death, Carter issued a statement and explained how he had \"changed the face of American popular culture\".[488] Carter filed a report with both the International UFO Bureau and the National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena,[489] stating that he sighted an unidentified flying object in October 1969.[490][491][492] From a young age, Carter showed a deep commitment to evangelical Christianity.[493][494] Carter taught Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains, Georgia.[495] At a private inauguration worship service, the preacher was Nelson Price, the pastor of Roswell Street Baptist Church of Marietta, Georgia.[496] An evangelical Christian, Carter appealed to voters after the scandals of the Nixon Administration, and is credited with popularizing the term \"born again\" into American lexicon during the 1976 American presidential campaign.[494][497][498][499] As president, Carter prayed several times a day, and professed that Jesus was the driving force in his life. He was greatly influenced by a sermon he had heard as a young man that asked: \"If you were arrested for being a Christian, would there be enough evidence to convict you?\"[500] In 2000, after the Southern Baptist Convention announced it would no longer permit women to become pastors, he renounced his membership, saying: \"I personally feel that women should play an absolutely equal role in service of Christ in the church.\"[501] He remained a member of the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship.[493] Carter's support for the Equal Rights Amendment[502] led many evangelical conservatives to leave the Democratic Party, contributing to the development of the Christian right in American politics.[503] Carter had three younger siblings, all of whom died of pancreatic cancer: sisters Gloria Spann (1926–1990) and Ruth Stapleton (1929–1983), and brother Billy Carter (1937–1988).[504] He was first cousin to politician Hugh Carter and a distant cousin to the Carter family of musicians.[505] He was related to Motown founder Berry Gordy by way of their white great-grandfather James Thomas Gordy, who fathered a child with a black woman he enslaved.[506] Carter married Rosalynn Smith on July 7, 1946, in the Plains Methodist Church, the church of Rosalynn's family.[507] They had three sons, Jack, James III \"Chip\", and Donnel; one daughter, Amy; nine grandsons (one of whom is deceased), three granddaughters, five great-grandsons, and eight great-granddaughters.[508] Mary Prince (an African American woman wrongly convicted of murder, and later pardoned) was their daughter Amy's nanny for most of the period from 1971 until Jimmy Carter's presidency ended.[509][510][511] Carter had asked to be designated as her parole officer, thus helping to enable her to work in the White House.[510][e] The Carters celebrated their 77th anniversary on July 7, 2023. On October 19, 2019, they became the longest-wed presidential couple, having overtaken George and Barbara Bush at 26,765 days.[514] After Rosalynn's death on November 19, 2023, Carter released the following statement: Rosalynn was my equal partner in everything I ever accomplished. She gave me wise guidance and encouragement when I needed it. As long as Rosalynn was in the world, I always knew somebody loved and supported me.[515] The Carters' eldest son, Jack Carter, was the 2006 Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate in Nevada and lost to Republican incumbent John Ensign. Jack's son Jason Carter is a former Georgia state senator,[516] and in 2014 was the Democratic nominee for governor of Georgia, losing to the Republican incumbent, Nathan Deal. On December 20, 2015, while teaching a Sunday school class, Carter announced that his 28-year-old grandson Jeremy Carter had died of unspecified causes.[517] On August 3, 2015, Carter underwent an elective surgery to remove a small mass on his liver, and his prognosis for a full recovery was initially said to be excellent. On August 12, he announced he had been diagnosed with cancer that had metastasized, without specifying where the cancer had originated.[518] On August 20, Carter disclosed that melanoma had been found in his brain and liver, and that he had begun treatment with the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab and was about to start radiation therapy. His healthcare was managed by Emory Healthcare of Atlanta. His family history of cancer includes both of his parents and all three of his siblings.[519] On December 5, he announced that his medical scans no longer showed any cancer.[520] Carter broke his hip in a fall at his Plains home on May 13, 2019, and underwent surgery the same day at the Phoebe Sumter Medical Center in Americus, Georgia.[521] On October 6, an injury above his left eyebrow received in another fall at home required 14 stitches[522] and resulted in a black eye.[523] On October 21, Carter was admitted to the Phoebe Sumter Medical Center after sustaining a minor pelvic fracture from falling at home for the third time in 2019.[524] He was able to resume teaching Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist Church on November 3.[525][526] On November 11, 2019, Carter was hospitalized at the Emory University Hospital in Atlanta for a procedure to relieve pressure on his brain caused by bleeding connected with his falls.[527][528] He was released from the hospital on November 27.[529][527] On December 2, 2019, Carter was readmitted to the hospital for a urinary tract infection. He was released on December 4.[530][531] On February 18, 2023, the Carter Center announced that following a \"series of short hospital stays\", Carter decided to \"spend his remaining time at home with his family\" in Plains to \"receive hospice care instead of additional medical intervention\"[532][533] for an unspecified illness.[534][535] At 100 years old, Carter was the longest-lived former U.S. president, a title he held until his death.[536] He was the second presidential candidate from a major political party to achieve this age, following Alf Landon, who was the Republican nominee in the 1936 United States presidential election.[537][538] Carter was the earliest-serving living former president since Gerald Ford's death in 2006. In 2012, he surpassed Herbert Hoover as the longest-retired president. In 2017 and 2021, Carter became the first president to live to the 40th anniversary of his inauguration and post-presidency respectively. In 2017, Carter, then 92, became the oldest former president ever to attend an American presidential inauguration.[539][540] On March 22, 2019, he became the longest-lived U.S. president, surpassing George H. W. Bush, who died a few months earlier at the age of 94 years, 171 days.[541] He said in a 2019 interview with People that he never expected to live as long as he had and that the best explanation for longevity was a good marriage.[542] Carter entered hospice care six months before celebrating his 99th birthday at his home.[543] The Carter Center announced Jimmy Carter 100: A Celebration in Song, an event concert to celebrate Carter's 100th birthday that featured appearances by musicians and celebrities. The event took place on September 17, 2024, at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta, Georgia.[544] On October 1, 2024, Carter turned 100, the first president to do so.[545] Local events to celebrate his birthday included a F-18 Super Hornet flyover formation by eight Navy pilots from Naval Air Station Oceana, which Carter viewed from his backyard, and a naturalization ceremony for 100 new citizens at Plains High School, which Chip Carter attended.[546][547] Carter made arrangements to be buried in front of his home at 209 Woodland Drive in Plains. In 2006, he said that a funeral in Washington, D.C., with visitation at the Carter Center, was also planned.[548] Carter asked President Biden to deliver his eulogy.[549] Carter died at his home in Plains, Georgia, on December 29, 2024, at the age of 100.[550][551][552] This followed his February 2023 decision to enter hospice.[553] Shortly after the announcement, President Joe Biden released a statement honoring Carter's legacy, calling him a \"man of principle, faith, and humility.\" The Biden administration also announced plans to hold an official state funeral, and a day of mourning for him on January 9, 2025.[554] When Carter left office in 1981, scholars and even many Democrats viewed his presidency as a failure.[555][556][557][558] Betty Glad, a political scientist at the University of Illinois, summarized the public consensus on Carter: \"he didn't have a well-developed political philosophy and gave people a feeling he didn't quite know where he was headed.\"[559] Historians have ranked Carter's presidency as below average.[560][561] After leaving office, he told allies he predicted history would be kinder to him than voters were in the 1980 election.[559] In a 1982 Chicago Tribune survey, when 49 historians and scholars were asked to rank the best and worst U.S. presidents, Carter was ranked the tenth worst.[562] In 2006, conservative British historian Andrew Roberts ranked Carter the worst U.S. president.[563] Yet some of Carter's policy accomplishments have been more favorably received.[564] The 2009 documentary Back Door Channels: The Price of Peace credits Carter's efforts at Camp David, which brought peace between Israel and Egypt, with bringing the only meaningful peace to the Middle East.[565][566] Stuart E. Eizenstat, who served as Carter's chief White House domestic policy adviser, wrote, \"Carter's accomplishments at home and abroad were more extensive and longer lasting than those of almost all modern presidents.\"[567] While historians generally consider Carter a below-average president, his post-presidency activities have been universally praised, including his peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts.[560][561] The Independent wrote in 2009, \"Carter is widely considered a better man than he was a president.\"[568] In exit polls from the 1976 presidential election, many voters still held Ford's pardon of Nixon in 1974 against him.[569] By comparison, Carter was viewed as a sincere, honest, and well-meaning southerner.[568] During his presidency, polls generally showed that most Americans saw Carter as likable and \"a man of high moral principles\".[570] In the 1980 election, Reagan projected an easy self-confidence, in contrast to Carter's serious and introspective temperament. Carter was portrayed as more pessimistic and indecisive than Reagan, who was known for his charm and delegation of tasks to subordinates.[571] Reagan used the economic issues, the Iran hostage crisis, and the lack of Washington cooperation to portray Carter as a weak and ineffectual leader. Carter was the first elected incumbent president since Herbert Hoover in 1932 to lose a reelection bid.[572] Carter began his presidency with an approval rating between 66% and 75%.[573][574] He maintained approval ratings above 50% until March 1978,[574] and the following month his approval rating fell to 39%,[575] primarily due to the declining economy.[576] His ratings briefly rebounded after the Camp David Accords in late 1978[577] but dipped during the 1979 energy crisis and got as low as 28% in July 1979.[578] At the beginning of the Iran hostage crisis, his approval rating surged to 61%, up 23 points from his pre-crisis rating.[579] Polls also found that up to 77% of Americans approved of Carter's initial response to the crisis,[579] but by June 1980, amid heated criticism from across the political spectrum[580] for his failure to free the hostages, his approval rating slumped to 33%; that same month Reagan surpassed Carter in pre-1980 election polling.[581] As Carter was leaving office, a Gallup poll found that 48% of Americans thought he had been an \"average\" or \"above average\" president, 46% said he had been \"below average\" or \"poor\", and only 3% thought he had been \"outstanding\".[582] His average approval rating during his entire presidency was 46%,[583][584] and he left office as one of the most unpopular U.S. presidents in history.[585] In a 1990 Gallup survey, 45% of respondents said they approved of the overall job Carter did as president, leaving only Nixon and Lyndon B. Johnson with lower ratings.[586] In a 2006 poll, 61% of respondents said they approved of the job Carter did as president, his highest rating since 1979.[587] In a 2021 survey, 27% of respondents said he had been an \"outstanding\" or \"above average\" president, 43% regarded him as \"average\", and only 24% said he had been \"below average\" or \"poor\".[588] Carterpuri, a village in Haryana, India, was renamed in his honor after he visited in 1978.[589] [590] Carter received the American Academy of Achievement's Golden Plate Award in 1984.[145] The Jimmy Carter Library and Museum was opened in 1986.[591] The following year, buildings connected to Carter's life were granted status as National Historic Sites[592] and in 2021 were collectively renamed the Jimmy Carter National Historic Park.[593] In 1991, Carter was made an honorary member of Phi Beta Kappa at Kansas State University,[594] and was elected to the American Philosophical Society.[595] In 1998, the U.S. Navy named the third and final Seawolf-class submarine USS Jimmy Carter, honoring Carter and his service as a submarine officer.[596] Carter received the United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights, given in honor of human rights achievements,[597] and the Hoover Medal, recognizing engineers who have contributed to global causes.[598] Carter's 2002 Nobel Peace Prize[599] was partially a response to president George W. Bush's threats of war against Iraq and Carter's criticism of the Bush administration.[600] In 2009, the Souther Field Airport in Americus, Georgia, was renamed Jimmy Carter Regional Airport.[601] In November 2024, Carter received his 10th nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for audio recordings of his books. He has won three times—for Our Endangered Values: America's Moral Crisis (2007), A Full Life: Reflections at 90 (2016), and Faith: A Journey For All (2018).[602][603][604][605][606][607] On February 21, 2024, the White House Historical Association unveiled its official 2024 White House Christmas ornament honoring Carter's naval service and efforts for peace. This was the first time a president being honored was alive at the time of the unveiling.[608]",

                "content": "James Earl Carter Jr. (October 1, 1924 – December 29, 2024) was an American politician and humanitarian. He was the 39th president of the United States from 1977 to 1981. He was a member of the Democratic Party. Before becoming president, Carter was a Georgia state senator from 1963 to 1967 and the 80th governor of Georgia from 1971 to 1975. He was born and grew up in Plains, Georgia. Carter graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1946 with a Bachelor of Science degree and joined the United States Navy. In 1953, Carter left the military and returned home to Georgia to take charge of the family's peanut-growing business. Carter was against racial segregation and supported the growing civil rights movement. He became an activist in the Democratic Party. From 1963 to 1967, Carter was in the Georgia State Senate, and in 1970, he was elected as Governor of Georgia. He was governor until 1975. At first, he was not seen as a serious presidential candidate as not many people knew him outside of Georgia. Carter eventually won the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination and was elected president, beating then-Republican President Gerald Ford. On his second day in office, Carter pardoned all the Vietnam War draft evaders. During Carter's term as president, he created the Department of Energy and the Department of Education. He also created a national energy policy that included conservation, price control, and new technology. In foreign affairs, Carter helped create the Camp David Accords, the Panama Canal Treaties, the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT II), and the return of the Panama Canal Zone to Panama. However, the economy during his presidency was bad as it had stagflation, high inflation, high unemployment and slow economic growth. The end of his presidential term was remembered for the 1979–1981 Iran hostage crisis, the 1979 energy crisis, the Three Mile Island nuclear accident, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. In 1980, Carter ran against Senator Ted Kennedy in the Democratic primaries and won re-nomination at the 1980 Democratic National Convention. Carter lost the 1980 presidential election. He lost to the Republican nominee Ronald Reagan, who won in a huge victory. Polls of historians and political scientists usually see Carter as an below-average president. He became more popular for his humanitarian work after leaving office. In 1982, Carter created the Carter Center to focus on human rights across the world. He traveled around the world to support peace talks, look over elections, and supported ending deadly diseases. In 2002, he won the Nobel Peace Prize. Carter was seen as an important person in the Habitat for Humanity charity. He wrote over 30 books from memoirs to poetry. Carter was the longest-lived president, the longest-retired president, the first to live forty years after their inauguration, and the first former president to reach the age of 100. Carter died on December 29, 2024 while in hospice care in Plains. Carter was born on October 1, 1924, at Lillian Carter Health and Rehabilitation in Plains, Georgia.[1] Carter was the first U.S. president to be born in a hospital.[2] He was the oldest son of Bessie Lillian (née Gordy) and James Earl Carter Sr.[3] The family moved many times when Carter was an infant.[4] The Carters settled on a dirt road in nearby Archery.[5] His family eventually had three more children: Gloria, Ruth, and Billy.[6] Carter had a good relationship with his parents even though his mother worked long hours, about twenty hours every day.[7] His father supported segregation, which allowed Carter to become friends with his family farm's Black workers.[8] Carter went to Plains High School from 1937 to 1941.[9] He also joined the Future Farmers of America and liked woodworking.[10][11] He also played basketball during his high school years.[8] After high school, Carter went to Georgia Southwestern College, in Americus, Georgia.[12] He took extra math classes at Georgia Tech.[13] In 1943, Carter was accepted to the United States Naval Academy.[14] While at the academy, Carter fell in love with Rosalynn Smith.[15] The two married shortly after his graduation in 1946.[15] He was a sprint football player for the Navy Midshipmen.[16] Carter graduated 60th out of 820 midshipmen in the class of 1946 with a Bachelor of Science degree and became an ensign.[17][18] From 1946 to 1953, Carter and Rosalynn lived in Virginia, Hawaii, Connecticut, New York and California, during his time in the Atlantic and Pacific fleets.[18] In 1948, he began officers' training for being in a submarine.[18] He was promoted to lieutenant junior grade in 1949.[18] In 1952, Carter began his work with the US Navy's nuclear submarine program.[19] He was sent to the Naval Reactors Branch of the Atomic Energy Commission in Washington, D.C. for three month.[20] During this time, Rosalynn moved with their children to Schenectady, New York.[19][20] In March 1953, Carter began nuclear power school at Union College in Schenectady.[21] Carter's father died and he was released from active duty to allow him to take over the family peanut business.[22] Carter left active duty on October 9, 1953.[22] He was not active at the Navy Reserve until 1961, and left the service as a lieutenant.[23] His awards included the American Campaign Medal, World War II Victory Medal, China Service Medal, and National Defense Service Medal.[24] Carter's father, James died after having recently been elected to the Georgia House of Representatives.[25] For a year, Jimmy, Rosalynn, and their three sons lived in public housing in Plains.[26] Carter is the only U.S. president to have lived in public housing before he took office.[26] Carter wanted to expand the family's peanut-growing business.[27] His first-year harvest failed because of droughts, however Carter wanted to open many bank lines of credit to keep the farm going.[27] He also took classes and read on agriculture while Rosalynn learned accounting to manage the business.[28] Even though they struggled at first, the Carters grew the peanut business and became successful.[27][28] Carter, who was against racial segregation, was inspired to run for office over the racial tensions in the country.[29] By 1961 he was a known member of the Plains community and the Baptist Church as well as chairman of the Sumter County school board.[30] At the school board, Carter spoke against racial segregation in public schools.[30] In 1962, Carter announced his run for a seat in the Georgia State Senate.[31] At first, the results showed Carter losing, but this was the result of fraudulent voting done by the Democratic Party chairman in Quitman County.[32] Carter challenged the results; when fraud was confirmed, a new election was held, which he won.[31] Beginning in 1962, Americus was known where black protesters were hit and abused.[33] Carter did not say anything about this at first.[34] He did speak about some race issues such as giving speeches against literacy tests and against a change to the state constitution.[34] When President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, Carter called it \"the greatest blow that I had suffered since my father died\".[35] Two years later, Carter was in charge of the Democratic Executive Committee, where he helped rewrite the state party's rules.[36] He became chairman of the West Central Georgia Planning and Development Commission.[36] When Bo Callaway was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in November 1964, Carter wanted to run against him in the next election.[37] The two had fought over which two-year college would be expanded to a four-year college.[37] Carter wanted it to go to his alma mater, Georgia Southwestern College, but Callaway wanted the funding to go to downtown Columbus.[37] Carter was re-elected in 1964 to a second two-year term.[38] For a time in the State Senate, he was in charge of its Education Committee and also was part of the Appropriations Committee toward the end of his second term.[39] Before his term ended he worked on a bill expanding statewide education funding and getting Georgia Southwestern a four-year program.[40] The last day of the term, he announced his run for the United States House of Representatives.[41] Carter ran for the United States House of Representatives for Georgia's 3rd district in 1966 against Bo Callaway.[37] However, Callaway ended his campaign to run for Governor of Georgia.[37] Callaway became a Republican in 1964.[42] Carter later wanted to run for governor against Callaway.[37] In the Democratic primary, he ran against the liberal former Governor Ellis Arnall and the conservative Lester Maddox.[43] Governor Maddox was not allowed to run for a second term as governor in 1970.[44] Carter had to run against Carl Sanders in the 1970 Democratic primary.[45] Carter was more conservative than before during this primary election.[46] That September, Carter was beating Sanders in the first round by 49% to 38%.[47] Since no one won more than half the vote, they went into a second round.[47] Carter won the Democratic nomination with 59% of the vote against Sanders's 40%.[48] In the general election, Carter beat Republican candidate Hal Suit, winning 59% of the vote against Suit's 40%.[49] Carter became the 76th Governor of Georgia on January 12, 1971.[50] In his inaugural speech, he said that \"the time of racial discrimination is over. ... No poor, rural, weak, or black person should ever have to bear the additional burden of being [without] the opportunity for an education, a job or simple justice\".[50] Time ran a story on the progressive \"New South\" governors elected that year in a May 1971 cover.[51] The cover of the magazine had Carter.[51] Lester Maddox, who Carter replaced as governor, became lieutenant governor.[50] Richard Russell Jr., then President pro tempore of the United States Senate, died in office during Carter's second week in office.[52] Carter picked David H. Gambrell, state Democratic Party chair, to replace Russell's in the United States Senate.[52] Carter wanted to grow the governor's power while making the state government easier to run.[53] He supported a bill that could give him the power of executive restructuring and to force a vote on it.[53][54] The plan was not popular in the state legislature.[53] But after two weeks of talking about the plan, it was passed.[53] He lowered the number of state agencies from 300 to 22.[55] In April 1971, while on television, Carter was asked if he supported the idea of governor and lieutenant governor running together.[56] He said, \"I've never really thought we needed a lieutenant governor in Georgia. The lieutenant governor is part of the executive branch of government and I've always felt—ever since I was in the state Senate—that the executive branches should be separate\".[56] In July 1971, while in Columbus, Georgia, Carter created a Georgia Human Rights Council that would help solve issues in the state of any possible violence.[57] In January 1972, Carter wanted to give state money for an Early Childhood Development Program and prison reform programs.[58] In April 1972, Carter went to Latin and South America for a possible trade deal with Georgia.[59] Carter said that he had met with Brazilian President Emílio Garrastazu Médici.[59] Many said he was acting like President Kennedy.[59] The number of black state workers, judges, and board members grew when Carter was governor.[60] He put paintings of Martin Luther King Jr. in the capitol building, while the Ku Klux Klan were at the ceremony protesting.[61] While on television with Governor of Florida Reubin Askew in January 1973, Carter said he supported a constitutional amendment to ban busing and to make desegregation in schools faster.[62] He supported an anti-busing plan with George Wallace at the 1971 National Governors Conference.[63][64] Carter signed a new death penalty law after the United States Supreme Court rejected it.[65] Carter later said he did not support the death penalty, saying, \"I didn't see the injustice of it as I do now\".[65] Carter wanted to give equal state aid to schools in the rich and poor areas of Georgia.[66] He helped create centers for mentally handicapped children and education programs for convicts.[67][68] He also wrote a program that made picking federal judges based on their experience over their political party possible.[69][70] In an unpopular move,[71] Carter rejected a plan to build a dam on Georgia's Flint River.[72] He said that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was not giving the right numbers on the project's cost and possible harm on the region.[72] The veto became popular with environmentalists across the country.[72] Carter was not allowed to run for re-election because of term limits.[73] Wanting to run for president, Carter was active in national politics and public appearances.[74] He was a delegate to the 1972 Democratic National Convention, where Carter hoped he would be George McGovern's vice presidential pick.[74] He supported Senator Henry \"Scoop\" Jackson, to not support George Wallace.[75][76] In May 1973, Carter told the Democratic Party to not make the Watergate scandal a political issue.[77] On December 12, 1974, Carter announced his candidacy for President of the United States at National Press Club in Washington, D.C.[78] He talked about inequality, optimism, and change.[79][80] When Carter first announced his presidential run for the Democratic Party presidential nomination, he was seen as having little chances against better-known politicians.[81] However, by March 1976 Carter was doing better in polls against other candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination.[81] He was also ahead of President Ford by a few percentage points.[81] Carter wrote Why Not the Best? in June 1976 to help make his name known for the American public.[82] Carter won the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary.[81] In the South, Carter ran as a moderate and in the North, Carter ran as a conservative Christian.[83] He had visited 37 states, and gave over 200 speeches before any other candidate entered the race.[84] Carter ended up winning 30 states, with a total of 6,235,609 (39.2%) of the popular vote.[85] He was officially nominated as the Democratic nominee at the national convention.[86] He picked U.S. Senator Walter Mondale from Minnesota as his vice president pick.[86] During his presidential campaign in April 1976, Carter said to an interviewer, \"I have nothing against a community that is ... trying to maintain the ethnic purity of their neighborhoods\".[87] Carter said he understood why some neighborhoods were against desegregation.[87] However, he also supported open-housing laws that make it illegal not to sell or rent a house or apartment to a person based on their race.[87] His comments were unpopular with many Americans.[87] Carter's campaign supported congressional campaigns using public financing,[88] creating a federal agency for consumer protection,[89] creating a separate department for education,[90] signing an agreement that would stop the Soviet Union from using nuclear weapons,[91] lowering money given to the military,[92] increasing taxes for the rich and lowering them for the middle class,[93] supporting the Social Security Act,[94] and having a budget that would give money to government resources.[95] Carter and President Gerald Ford were in three televised debates during the 1976 election.[96] The debates were the first presidential debates since 1960.[96][97] Carter was interviewed by Robert Scheer of Playboy for the November 1976 issue, which hit the newsstands a couple of weeks before the election.[98] While discussing his religion's view of pride, Carter said: \"I've looked on a lot of women with lust. I've committed adultery in my heart many times\".[98][99] He also said in another interview that he did not mind if people said the word \"fuck\".[100] This led to a media to criticize the idea if politicians should be separated from their political campaigns and their private intimate lives.[100] Carter began the race with a lead over Ford, who narrowed the gap during the campaign, but lost to Carter in by a small margin on November 2, 1976.[101] Carter won the popular vote by 50.1 percent to 48.0 percent for Ford, and received 297 electoral votes to Ford's 240.[102] Carter won fewer states than Ford, with Carter winning 23 states compared to Ford winning 27.[102] Carter was inaugurated as president on January 20, 1977.[3] On April 18, 1977, Carter gave a televised speech saying that the U.S. energy crisis during the 1970s was like war.[103] He supported energy conservation by all Americans and added solar water heating panels on the White House.[104][105] He wore sweaters because he turned down the heat in the White House.[106] On August 4, 1977, Carter created the Department of Energy.[107] During the signing event, Carter said the current \"crisis of energy shortages\" made him create the Department of Energy.[108] Carter said that the House of Representatives had created many energy saving ideas.[109] A month later, on October 13, Carter stated he believed in the Senate's power to pass the energy reform bill.[110] He said that \"the most important domestic issue that we will face while I am in office\" was the energy crisis.[110] On January 12, 1978, during a press conference, Carter said plans about his energy reform proposal were not being made and that Congress was not being respectful.[111] In April 1978, Carter said his biggest surprise since becoming president was the how hard it was for Congress to pass an energy reform bill.[112] On March 1, 1979, Carter wanted to create a gasoline rationing plan with Congress approving it.[113] On April 5, he talked about how important energy conservation is.[114] At the end of the month, Carter said it was important that the Congress pass his gas rationing plan.[115] On July 15, 1979, Carter said the crisis was a \"crisis of confidence\" among the American people.[116][117] Many did not like Carter's speech.[118][119][120] People thought Carter for not doing enough to solve the crisis.[121] Many believed he wanted Americans to do most of the work instead of the government.[121] In 1978, Carter said the Love Canal accident in the city of Niagara Falls, New York was a federal emergency.[122] During the 1940s, the canal was used as the site to dump chemical products from dyes, perfumes, and solvents for rubber and synthetic resins.[123] More than 800 families were evacuated from the neighborhood, which was built on top of a toxic waste landfill.[122] The Superfund law was created because of Love Canal.[124] Carter said that many places like \"Love Canals\" existed across the country.[125] He said that discovering hazardous dumpsites was \"one of the [saddest] discoveries of our modern era\".[125] In 1979, the Environmental Protection Agency said that people living near the Love Canal accident were at risk for leukemia.[126][127][128] Carter had many problems with the economy when he became president.[129] He tried to continue the recovery from the severe 1973–75 recession.[130] His economy also had high inflation, with very high interest rates, oil shortages, and slow economic growth.[129] In his first two years, Carter created millions of new jobs.[131][132] The 1979 energy crisis ended job growth, however, and both inflation and interest rates rose.[133] Economic growth, job creation, and consumer confidence quickly went down.[133] There was also not a lot of gasoline because of the oil crisis.[134] Carter signed the Airline Deregulation Act into law on October 24, 1978.[135] The main purpose was to remove government control over fees, routes and airline market from commercial aviation.[135] The Civil Aeronautics Board's powers of regulation were removed.[135] The act did not remove the FAA's powers over airline safety.[136] In 1979, Carter deregulated the American beer industry by making it legal to sell malt, hops, and yeast to American home brewers for the first time since the beginning of Prohibition in the United States.[137] This led to an increase in home brewing over the 1980s and 1990s that by the 2000s.[138] During his presidential campaign, Carter wanted to fix healthcare in the country.[139] Carter's plans on healthcare included an April 1977 mandatory health care cost proposal,[140] and a June 1979 plan that gave private health insurance coverage.[141] Carter saw the June 1979 plan as a growing part of Medicare and Medicaid.[142][143] The April 1977 mandatory health care cost plan was passed in the Senate,[144] and later was not approved in the House.[145] During 1978, Carter also had meetings with Kennedy for a healthcare law that did not pass the U.S. House.[146] Carter later blamed Kennedy for his healthcare plans not being approved in Congress.[147] Carter worked with Congress to create an education department.[148] In February 1978, Carter said that education is very important and should not be in control over many departments.[149] On February 8, 1979, Carter released a plan to create an education department.[148] On October 17, 1979, Carter signed a law that created the United States Department of Education.[150] Carter grew the Head Start program by adding 43,000 children and families.[151] In a November 1980 speech, Carter said he would allow the Head Start to migrant children and wanted to increase building schools near the Mexico–United States border in Texas.[152] In September 1977, Carter and General Omar Torrijos signed the Panama Canal Treaty.[153] The treaties would give Panama control of the Panama Canal after 1999.[153] This would remove United States control of the canal.[153] The second treaty said that Panama would have full control of the canal.[153] The treaty was not popular with conservatives.[153] In September 1978, Carter created many political agreements between Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin at Camp David.[154] The two agreements were signed at the White House.[154] The second of these frameworks helped create the 1979 Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty.[155] Carter spoke to African officials at the United Nations about his support of democratic elections and power in African countries.[156] Carter later said his plans for wanting \"to work with South Africa in dealing with the threats to peace in Namibia and in Zimbabwe\" and to end racial issues like apartheid.[157] Carter visited Nigeria from March 31 to April 3, 1978, trying to fix relations with the country.[158] He was the first U.S. president to visit Nigeria.[159] Carter wanted to create peace in Rhodesia.[160] On May 16, 1979, the Senate voted in favor of President Carter ending economic sanctions against Rhodesia.[161] In November 1977, Carter said he wanted to have a good partnership between the United States and Iran.[162] In November 1979, a group of Iranian students took over the United States Embassy in Tehran.[163] The students were in support of the Iranian Revolution.[163] 52 Americans were held hostage for the next 444 days until they were freed on January 20, 1981.[164] They were freed on the day Ronald Reagan replaced Carter as president.[164] During the crisis, Carter never left the White House for more than 100 days.[165] In December 1979, Carter said he wanted to solve the issue without using the military or violence.[166] On April 7, 1980, Carter passed Executive Order 12205, adding economic sanctions against Iran[167] and announced more action to make sure the hostages were released safely.[168][169] On April 24, 1980, Carter pushed for Operation Eagle Claw to try to free the hostages.[170] The mission failed as military helicopters crashed killing eight American military people.[170][171] Whistleblowers have said that people working on Ronald Reagan's campaign convinced Iran to not release the hostages to make sure Carter was not re-elected.[172] On February 8, 1977, Carter said he had wanted the Soviet Union to work with the United States to stop nuclear testing.[173] During a June 13 meeting, Carter said that the United States would begin to talk to the Soviet Union about demilitarization of the Indian Ocean.[174] On December 30, Carter said that the United States and the Soviet Union have made great progress on talking about important issues.[175] These talks helped create the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty II by Carter and Leonid Brezhnev on June 18, 1979.[176][177] Nur Muhammad Taraki and other Communists took power in Afghanistan on April 27, 1978.[178] Following an uprising in April 1979, Taraki was removed by Khalq rival Hafizullah Amin in September.[179] By December, Amin's government had lost control of much of the country.[178] This caused the Soviet Union to invade Afghanistan.[178] Carter was surprised by the invasion.[180] The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was seen as a threat and Carter saw the Soviet Union as dangerous.[181] Carter announced sanctions on the Soviet Union.[181][182] He created an embargo on grain to the Soviet Union.[183][184] Carter also supported not taking part of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.[185] British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher supported Carter's actions towards the Soviet Union.[186] In early 1980, Carter created a program to arm the mujahideen.[187] The Soviets were unable to fight off them off and left Afghanistan in 1989.[187] In March 1977, Carter supported removing American troops from South Korea.[188] He wanted South Korea to have their own military forces to protect themselves from North Korea.[188] Carter's move to remove the troops was unpopular with military officials.[189] In May, Carter said he believed South Korea would be able to defend themselves without as many American troops.[190] From June 30 to July 1, 1979, Carter had meetings with President of South Korea Park Chung-hee at the Blue House.[191] Carter said that the liberal part of the Democratic Party did not support his policies the most.[192] He said they were caused by Senator Ted Kennedy's plan to replace him as president.[192] Kennedy announced his plans to run for president in November 1979.[193][194][195] Kennedy did not run a good campaign and Carter won most of the primaries.[196] Carter won the Democratic re-nomination, however, Kennedy gave Carter weak support from the Liberal Democrats in the general election.[196] Carter and Vice President Walter Mondale were nominated at the Democratic National Convention in New York City.[197] Carter's campaign for re-election in 1980 was not easy as he ran against Republican Ronald Reagan.[198] His campaign manager and former appointments secretary, Timothy Kraft, left the campaign five weeks before the election because of possible cocaine use.[199] On October 28, Carter and Reagan had the only presidential debate of the election.[200] Reagan was losing to Carter at first,[201] but after the debates, Reagan became popular.[202] Carter lost his re-election to Reagan in a landslide victory.[198] Reagan won 489 of the electoral votes and Carter won 49.[198] After the election, Carter said that he was hurt by the outcome of the election.[203] Shortly after losing his re-election bid, Carter told the White House press corps that he wanted his retirement to be similar than that of Harry S. Truman and not use his public life to make himself rich.[204] In October 1986, his presidential library was opened in Atlanta, Georgia.[205] At aged 88, Carter built homes in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy,[206] and partnered with former presidents to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities.[207] Carter went to the opening ceremonies of his presidential library[205] and those of Presidents Ronald Reagan,[208] George H. W. Bush,[209] Bill Clinton,[210][211] and George W.

Bush, Carter was against the Iraq War.[249] He believed Bush wanted to remove Saddam Hussein by using lies.[250] In May 2007, Carter stated the Bush administration \"has been the worst in history\" in terms of its impact in foreign affairs,[251] Carter did not support Bush administration's handling of Hurricane Katrina.[252] Though he supported President Barack Obama in the early part of his presidency,[253] Carter criticized his use of drone strikes against suspected terrorists, Obama's choice to keep Guantanamo Bay detention camp open,[254] and use of surveillance programs.[255][256] In July 2016, Carter announced his support of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's presidential nomination during the 2016 Democratic National Convention.[257] Carter said that the 2016 election would \"define the US for a generation\".[257] He originally supported Vermont U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and voted for him during the primaries in 2016.[258] During the Donald Trump presidency, Carter supported immigration reform through Congress,[259] and did not support Trump's response during the national anthem protests.[260] In September 2019, Carter said he would support an \"age-limit\" for presidential candidates.[258] In August 2020, he supported former Vice President Joe Biden for president during a video played at the 2020 Democratic National Convention.[261] In October 2024, weeks after turning 100, Carter voted for Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election by absentee ballot.[262] Carter and Rosalynn Smith had three sons, one daughter, eight grandsons, three granddaughters, and two great-grandsons.[263][264][265] Carter and Rosalynn were well known for their work as volunteers with Habitat for Humanity.[266] Carter's hobbies included painting,[267] fly-fishing, woodworking, cycling, tennis, and skiing.[268] He also liked poetry.[269] Carter was also a personal friend of Elvis Presley.[270] Carter and Rosalynn met him on June 30, 1973, before Presley was to perform onstage in Atlanta.[270] The day after Presley's death, Carter issued a statement and explained how he had \"changed the face of American popular culture\".[271] In 2000, Carter ended his membership with the Southern Baptist Convention, saying the group's ideas did not support with his Christian beliefs.[272] Carter became the oldest to ever attend a presidential inauguration in 2017, at age 92, and the first to live to the 40th anniversary of their own.[273][274] Two years later, on March 22, 2019, he became the nation's longest-lived president.[275] On October 1, 2019, Carter became the first U.S. president to live to the age of 95.[276] In May 2023, it was announced that his wife Rosalynn had dementia.[277][278] She entered hospice care alongside her husband on November 17, 2023,[279] and died two days later at the age of 96.[280] He went to her funeral in Atlanta on November 28 alongside all living former first ladies, former President Bill Clinton and President Joe Biden.[281] She was buried at their home that they built, where Carter also planned to be buried.[282] On October 1, 2024, Carter turned 100, the first president to do so.[283][284] On August 3, 2015, Carter had surgery to remove \"a small mass\" on his liver. On August 12, however, Carter announced he had been diagnosed with cancer that had metastasized.[285] On August 20, he said that melanoma had been found in his brain and liver.[286] On December 6, 2015, Carter said that his medical scans no longer showed any cancer.[287] On May 13, 2019, Carter broke his hip at his Plains home and had surgery in Americus, Georgia.[288] On October 6, 2019, Carter got 14 stitches above his left eyebrow after injuring it during another fall at home.[289] A few weeks later, Carter was hospitalized after having a minor pelvic fracture after falling again at home.[290] A month after his fall, Carter was hospitalized in November at the Emory University Hospital in Atlanta to relieve pressure on his brain.[291] The surgery was successful, and Carter was released from the hospital on November 27.[292][293] In February 2021, it was announced that Carter and his wife both received their doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.[294] In late February 2023, Carter stopped medical treatment and started hospice care at home.[295] He was being treated for an \"aggressive form\" of melanoma.[296] On March 13, 2023 it was revealed by President Joe Biden that Carter had asked him to deliver his eulogy after his death.[297] His grandson said in June 2024 that Carter is no longer awake every day.[298] Two months later, Carter said he hoped to vote for the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, in the 2024 presidential election.[299] Later that month, his grandson said that Carter was really sick, although he hoped to turn 100 years old and vote to in the 2024 election.[300] Carter died at his home in Plains on December 29, 2024, almost three months after his 100th birthday.[301][302][303] Shortly after his death, President Joe Biden honored Carter's legacy, calling him a \"man of principle, faith, and humility.\"[304] President-elect Donald Trump and former Presidents Bill Clinton, George W.

Johnson with lower ratings.[323] In a 2018 retrospective poll, Carter's presidency received a 55% favorability rating, its highest since 1980.[324] Carter has had many awards since his presidency. In 1998, the U.S. Navy named the third and last Seawolf-class submarine honoring former President Carter and his service as a submariner officer.[325] That year he also received the United Nations Human Rights Prize, given in honor of human rights achievements,[326] and the Hoover Medal.[327] He won the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize.[328] Carter has been nominated ten times for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for audio recordings of his books, and has won three times in 2007, 2016 and 2019.[329][330][331][332] In November 2024, at age 100, Carter got his tenth nomination.[333] This made him the oldest nominee ever.[333] The Souther Field Airport in Americus, Georgia was renamed Jimmy Carter Regional Airport in 2009.[334] Death and state funeral of Jimmy Carter Dunant / Passy (1901) · Ducommun / Gobat (1902) · Cremer (1903) · IDI (1904) · Suttner (1905) · Roosevelt (1906) · Moneta / Renault (1907) · Arnoldson / Bajer (1908) · Beernaert / Estournelles de Constant (1909) · IPB (1910) · Asser / Fried (1911) · Root (1912) · La Fontaine (1913) · International Committee of the Red Cross (1917) · Wilson (1919) · Bourgeois (1920) · Branting / Lange (1921) · Nansen (1922) · Chamberlain / Dawes (1925) Briand / Stresemann (1926) · Buisson / Quidde (1927) · Kellogg (1929) · Söderblom (1930) · Addams / Butler (1931) · Angell (1933) · Henderson (1934) · Ossietzky (1935) · Lamas (1936) · Cecil (1937) · Nansen Office (1938) · International Committee of the Red Cross (1944) · Hull (1945) · Balch / Mott (1946) · QPSW / AFSC (1947) · Boyd Orr (1949) · Bunche (1950) Jouhaux (1951) · Schweitzer (1952) · Marshall (1953) · UNHCR (1954) · Pearson (1957) · Pire (1958) · Noel‑Baker (1959) · Lutuli (1960) · Hammarskjöld (1961) · Pauling (1962) · International Committee of the Red Cross / League of Red Cross Societies (1963) · King (1964) · UNICEF (1965) · Cassin (1968) · ILO (1969) · Borlaug (1970) · Brandt (1971) · Kissinger / Le (1973) · MacBride / Sato (1974) · Sakharov (1975) B.Williams / Corrigan (1976) · AI (1977) · Sadat / Begin (1978) · Mother Teresa (1979) · Esquivel (1980) · UNHCR (1981) · Myrdal / García Robles (1982) · Wałęsa (1983) · Tutu (1984) · IPPNW (1985) · Wiesel (1986) · Arias (1987) · UN Peacekeeping Forces (1988) · Dalai Lama (1989) · Gorbachev (1990) · Suu Kyi (1991) · Menchú (1992) · Mandela / de Klerk (1993) · Arafat / Peres / Rabin (1994) · Pugwash Conferences / Rotblat (1995) · Belo / Ramos-Horta (1996) · ICBL / J.Williams (1997) · Hume / Trimble (1998) · Médecins Sans Frontières (1999) · Kim (2000) UN / Annan (2001) · Carter (2002) · Ebadi (2003) · Maathai (2004) · IAEA / ElBaradei (2005) · Yunus / Grameen Bank (2006) · Gore / IPCC (2007) · Ahtisaari (2008) · Obama (2009) · Xiaobo (2010) · Sirleaf / Gbowee / Karman (2011) · EU (2012) · Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (2013) · Yousafzai / Satyarthi (2014) · Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet (2015) · Juan Manuel Santos (2016) · International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (2017) · Mukwege / Murad (2018) · Ahmed (2019) · World Food Programme (2020) · Ressa / Muratov (2021) · Bialiatski / Memorial / Center for Civil Liberties (2022) · Mohammadi (2023) · Nihon Hidankyo (2024)",

Jimmy Carter served as the 39th President of the United States from 1977 to 1981. He was awarded the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize for work to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development. Jimmy Carter aspired to make Government “competent and compassionate,” responsive to the American people and their expectations. His achievements were notable, but in an era of rising energy costs, mounting inflation, and continuing tensions, it was impossible for his administration to meet these high expectations. Carter, who has rarely used his full name–James Earl Carter, Jr.–was born October 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia. Peanut farming, talk of politics, and devotion to the Baptist faith were mainstays of his upbringing. Upon graduation in 1946 from the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, Carter married Rosalynn Smith. The Carters have three sons, John William (Jack), James Earl III (Chip), Donnel Jeffrey (Jeff), and a daughter, Amy Lynn. After seven years’ service as a naval officer, Carter returned to Plains. In 1962 he entered state politics, and eight years later he was elected Governor of Georgia. Among the new young southern governors, he attracted attention by emphasizing ecology, efficiency in government, and the removal of racial barriers. Carter announced his candidacy for President in December 1974 and began a two-year campaign that gradually gained momentum. At the Democratic Convention, he was nominated on the first ballot. He chose Senator Walter F. Mondale of Minnesota as his running mate. Carter campaigned hard against President Gerald R. Ford, debating with him three times. Carter won by 297 electoral votes to 241 for Ford. Carter worked hard to combat the continuing economic woes of inflation and unemployment. By the end of his administration, he could claim an increase of nearly eight million jobs and a decrease in the budget deficit, measured in percentage of the gross national product. Unfortunately, inflation and interest rates were at near record highs, and efforts to reduce them caused a short recession. Carter could point to a number of achievements in domestic affairs. He dealt with the energy shortage by establishing a national energy policy and by decontrolling domestic petroleum prices to stimulate production. He prompted Government efficiency through civil service reform and proceeded with deregulation of the trucking and airline industries. He sought to improve the environment. His expansion of the national park system included protection of 103 million acres of Alaskan lands. To increase human and social services, he created the Department of Education, bolstered the Social Security system, and appointed record numbers of women, blacks, and Hispanics to Government jobs. In foreign affairs, Carter set his own style. His championing of human rights was coldly received by the Soviet Union and some other nations. In the Middle East, through the Camp David agreement of 1978, he helped bring amity between Egypt and Israel. He succeeded in obtaining ratification of the Panama Canal treaties. Building upon the work of predecessors, he established full diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of China and completed negotiation of the SALT II nuclear limitation treaty with the Soviet Union. There were serious setbacks, however. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan caused the suspension of plans for ratification of the SALT II pact. The seizure as hostages of the U. S. embassy staff in Iran dominated the news during the last 14 months of the administration. The consequences of Iran’s holding Americans captive, together with continuing inflation at home, contributed to Carter’s defeat in 1980. Even then, he continued the difficult negotiations over the hostages. Iran finally released the 52 Americans the same day Carter left office.

He was educated in the public school of Plains, attended Georgia Southwestern College and the Georgia Institute of Technology, and received a B.S. degree from the United States Naval Academy in 1946. In the Navy he became a submariner, serving in both the Atlantic and Pacific fleets and rising to the rank of lieutenant. Chosen by Admiral Hyman Rickover for the nuclear submarine program, he was assigned to Schenectady, New York, where he took graduate work at Union College in reactor technology and nuclear physics and served as senior officer of the pre-commissioning crew of the Seawolf, the second nuclear submarine. On July 7, 1946, he married Rosalynn Smith of Plains. When his father died in 1953, he resigned his naval commission and returned with his family to Georgia. He took over the Carter farms, and he and Rosalynn operated Carter's Warehouse, a general-purpose seed and farm supply company in Plains. He quickly became a leader of the community, serving on county boards supervising education, the hospital authority, and the library. In 1962 he won election to the Georgia Senate. He lost his first gubernatorial campaign in 1966, but won the next election, becoming Georgia's 76th governor on January 12, 1971.

He championed human rights throughout the world. On the domestic side, the administration's achievements included a comprehensive energy program conducted by a new Department of Energy; deregulation in energy, transportation, communications, and finance; major educational programs under a new Department of Education; and major environmental protection legislation, including the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, which doubled the size of the national park system and tripled the wilderness areas.

                "content": "Watch the Game Highlights from Barbastro vs. Barcelona, 01/04/2025 Barcelona kicked off their Copa del Rey campaign with a 4-0 win at fourth-tier Barbastro on Saturday to progress into the round of 16, with striker Robert Lewandowski scoring either side of the break. Defender Eric García put Barca in front with a bullet header in the 21st minute before Lewandowski nodded home from close range 10 minutes later. The Poland striker added a third goal two minutes into the second half with a simple low finish from near the penalty spot and Pablo Torre made it 4-0 after capitalising on an error by Barbastro goalkeeper Arnau Fabrega. \"We had to start the year like this,\" coach Hansi Flick told a news conference. \"We were very good in defence. We didn't give our rivals any chance.\" The win saw Flick reach the 100th victory of his managerial career while Barcelona's emergency signing Wojciech Szczesny made his debut in goal for the club. Former Poland keeper Szczesny came out of retirement when he joined the LaLiga giants in October to replace the injured Marc-Andre Ter Stegen but had to wait to make his debut while his competition between the posts Iñaki Peña maintained good form. Barcelona took the lead when defender Ronald Araújo nodded on a long pass inside the box by Frenkie De Jong for García to net into a bottom corner. Araújo was making his season debut after suffering a hamstring injury in July during the Copa America. \"Ronald was injured but today we saw that he is fine,\" Flick said. \"We have to be careful with him but he played well for 90 minutes. He is a leader, a captain. It's good to have him.\" The hosts thwarted many of the visitors' attempts but Lewandowski, LaLiga's top scorer with 16 goals, doubled the lead after the ball deflected off a defender. The 36-year-old added another goal after the break as Barcelona continued to dominate possession, with around 80% throughout the game. Torre sealed the win in the 56th minute, calmly scoring after home keeper Fabrega failed to find one of his defenders with a low pass which ended up at the feet of the Barcelona midfielder instead. Barcelona, who face Athletic Club in a Spanish Super Cup semifinal on Wednesday, rested forward Raphinha, while midfielder Marc Casadó and defender Alejandro Balde remained on the bench. Aragonian club Barbastro sit 16th in Group Two of the Segunda Federacion. The two teams met at the same stage of the Copa del Rey last year when Barcelona won 3-2.",

                "content": "Derrick Lamar Henry Jr.[1][2] (born January 4, 1994)[1] is an American professional football running back for the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League (NFL). Nicknamed \"King Henry\",[3][4] he is known for his imposing style of play and larger build than the average running back. Born and raised in Yulee, Florida, Henry set the national high school football record for career rushing yards with the Yulee Hornets. He played college football for the Alabama Crimson Tide, where during his junior season, he broke Herschel Walker's single-season college rushing yards record in the Southeastern Conference (SEC), won the 2015 Heisman Trophy, the Doak Walker Award, the Maxwell Award, and the Walter Camp Award, and was a key part of the 2015 Alabama Crimson Tide football team that won the 2016 College Football Playoff National Championship. Henry was selected by the Tennessee Titans in the second round of the 2016 NFL draft, where he was a four-time Pro Bowl selection. A backup for most of his first two seasons in the league, Henry emerged as the Titans' feature back near the end of the 2018 season. He led the NFL in rushing yards for the 2019 season, as well as rushing touchdowns (tied with Green Bay Packers running back Aaron Jones). In 2020, Henry again led the league in rushing yards and touchdowns and became the eighth player in NFL history to rush for over 2,000 yards in a single season, and the second Tennessee Titan to do so, after Chris Johnson achieved it in 2009. Henry won the 2020 Associated Press NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award. After missing more than half of the 2021 season to injury, he made his third and fourth Pro Bowl appearances in the subsequent two seasons. After eight seasons with Tennessee, Henry signed with the Ravens in 2024. Derrick Lamar Henry Jr. was born in Yulee, Florida, to Stacy Veal and Derrick Henry Sr., aged 15 and 16 respectively.[5] Henry's father was absent for much of his childhood, having been arrested 20 times for various crimes including drug and prostitution-related offenses, and was consequently in and out of prison and had trouble maintaining employment. His mother became a hemodialysis technician. Henry was raised primarily by his grandmother, Gladys, who nicknamed him \"Shocka\", as his birth shocked the whole family, given his parents' young ages. He developed a close relationship to his grandmother, whom he cites as very influential in his upbringing.[6][7] Henry attended Yulee High School, where he was a three-sport star in football, basketball, and track. He played as a running back for the Yulee Hornets football team.[8] He ran for 2,465 yards and 26 touchdowns as a freshman in 2009. He was named a first-team All-Coast selection at running back in 2010 after rushing for 2,788 yards and 38 touchdowns while averaging 8.9 yards per attempt. He rushed for 2,610 yards and 34 scores as a junior in 2011 to earn first-team All-Coast honors from the Florida Times-Union. He set the Florida high school record with a 510-yard performance against Jacksonville Jackson (a record he held until 2021[9]) and averaged 9.2 yards per carry and 327.8 yards per game as a senior, finishing the season with a state-record 4,261 yards and 55 touchdowns.[10] He finished his high school football career with 12,124 career rushing yards, which broke Ken Hall's career record.[11][12] During this time, Henry began receiving the nickname \"King Henry\" by stadium crowds and local television news reports as he began aiming to break the national high school rushing title.[13] He also rushed for 153 career touchdowns. His career touchdown totals rank fifth all-time. In four years at Yulee he averaged more than 250 yards a game and never rushed for fewer than 100 yards in a game.[14] He played for the East squad in the 2013 U.S. Army All-American Bowl, where he rushed for 53 yards with a touchdown and a two-point conversion.[15][16] As a track & field athlete, Henry competed as a sprinter at Yulee from 2010 to 2011. He posted a personal-best time of 11.11 seconds in the 100-meter dash at the 2011 FHSAA 2A District 3 Championships, where he placed seventh.[17] He was also a member of the 4×100 and 4×400 squads.[18] Considered a five-star recruit by ESPN.com, Henry was listed as the No. 1 athlete (player with no designated position) in the nation in 2013.[19] After originally committing to the University of Georgia, Henry committed to the University of Alabama on September 28, 2012.[20] He held offers from many of the top college football programs in the country, including USC, Notre Dame, Tennessee, Florida, and Clemson.[21] His number was eventually retired by Yulee.[22] Henry attended and played college football for the University of Alabama from 2013 to 2015 under head coach Nick Saban.[23][24] He majored in communication. He graduated on May 4, 2018.[25] That same day, he published an article in The Players' Tribune thanking his late grandmother for the inspiration to continue pursuing his degree.[25][26] As a true freshman in 2013, Henry rushed for 382 yards on 36 carries with three touchdowns in a backfield largely dominated by T. J. Yeldon and Kenyan Drake.[27][28] On October 19, against Arkansas, he had 111 rushing yards and his first collegiate rushing touchdown in the 52–0 victory.[29] During the 2014 Sugar Bowl, he rushed for 100 yards and a touchdown on eight carries and had a 61-yard touchdown reception in the 45–31 loss to the Oklahoma Sooners.[30][31] In that game, Spanish-language broadcaster Pablo Viruega on ESPN Deportes nicknamed him \"El Tractorcito\" (The Little Tractor) due to his long stride and powerful gait. The nickname became a popular internet meme.[32] In the 2014 season, Henry and Yeldon split a majority of the work in the backfield.[33] In the season opener against West Virginia, he had 113 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown in the 33–23 victory in the Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game.[34] On September 20, against Florida, he had 111 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown in the 42–21 victory.[35] On October 18 against Texas A&M, he had 70 rushing yards, one rushing touchdown, and a 41-yard receiving touchdown in the 59–0 victory.[36] On November 22, against Western Carolina, he had 92 rushing yards, two rushing touchdowns, and a nine-yard receiving touchdown in the 48–14 victory.[37] In the annual rivalry game against Auburn, he had 72 rushing yards and a touchdown in the high-scoring 55–44 installment of the rivalry.[38] In the SEC Championship against Missouri, he had 141 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in the 42–13 victory.[39] Alabama qualified for the College Football Playoff and faced off against Ohio State in the National Semifinals in the Sugar Bowl.[40] Henry had 95 rushing yards, one rushing touchdown, and two receptions for 54 yards as Alabama fell 42–35 to the Buckeyes.[41] In his sophomore year, Henry rushed for 990 yards on 172 carries with 11 touchdowns.[42] After Yeldon left for the NFL, Henry took over as the starting running back as a junior in 2015. In the season opener against Wisconsin, he had 147 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns in the 35–17 victory.[43] In the next game, against Middle Tennessee State, he had 96 rushing yards and another game with three rushing touchdowns in the 37–10 victory.[44] In the next game against Ole Miss, he had 127 rushing yards, one rushing touchdown, and five receptions for 39 yards in Alabama's only loss of the season, a 43–37 decision.[45] After rushing for 52 yards against Louisiana–Monroe, he had 148 rushing yards and a touchdown in a 38–10 victory over previously undefeated Georgia.[46][47] On October 10, he rushed for 95 yards and a touchdown against Arkansas in a 27–14 victory.[48] After the victory over the Razorbacks, he went on an impressive stretch of performances. On October 17, against Texas A&M, he had 236 rushing yards, two rushing touchdowns, and an 18-yard reception in a 41–23 victory.[49] In the next game, a narrow 19–14 victory over Tennessee, he had 143 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns.[50] In the following game, a much-anticipated matchup with fellow Heisman contender Leonard Fournette of LSU, he had 210 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns in the 30–16 victory over the previously undefeated team.[51][52] In the next game, against Mississippi State, he had 204 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in the 31–6 victory.[53] In the next game, against Charleston Southern, he had 68 rushing yards and two more rushing touchdowns in a limited role in the 56–6 victory.[54] In the Iron Bowl against Auburn, he had 271 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown on 46 carries in the 29–13 victory.[55] In the SEC Championship against Florida, he had 44 carries for 189 yards and a touchdown in the 29–15 victory.[56] Alabama qualified for the College Football Playoff and faced off against Michigan State in the National Semifinals.[57] In the 38–0 victory over the Spartans in the Cotton Bowl, he had 75 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns.[58] During Alabama's 45–40 victory over Clemson in the 2016 College Football Playoff National Championship, he rushed for 158 yards on 36 carries with three touchdowns.[59] During the game, he also broke Shaun Alexander's record for most career rushing yards in Alabama history.[60] Playing in all 15 games, he rushed for SEC records 2,219 yards and 28 touchdowns on 395 carries. In addition, he scored at least one touchdown in each game.[61][62][63] He led the NCAA in rushing attempts, rushing yards, rushing touchdowns, and points scored.[64] Henry won the Heisman Trophy, beating out finalists Christian McCaffrey and Deshaun Watson.[65] He won numerous other awards including the Doak Walker Award, Walter Camp Award, and Maxwell Award.[66] Henry declared for the 2016 NFL Draft after his junior season.[25] Coming out of Alabama, Henry was projected by the majority of analysts to be either drafted in the late first or second round. Scouts regarded his main assets to be his large frame, violent running, ability to break tackles with ease, speed, long strides, superior conditioning, and consistent play. The main concerns were about the wear and tear his body took as a workhorse at Alabama, his slow acceleration, average foot quickness, below-average catching ability, narrow based running style, sluggish cutbacks, and running tall.[67] Henry was drafted by the Tennessee Titans in the second round (45th overall) of the 2016 NFL draft.[70] He was the second running back taken that year, after #4 Ezekiel Elliott.[71] He was reunited with his former fullback at Alabama Jalston Fowler.[72] On May 9, 2016, the Titans signed Henry to a four-year, $5.40 million contract with $3.30 million guaranteed and a signing bonus of $2.13 million.[73] Henry began his rookie season as the backup running back to veteran DeMarco Murray. He wore the No. 2 jersey throughout training camp and preseason and donned the No. 22 once running back Dexter McCluster was cut on September 2, 2016.[74] Henry made his NFL debut and earned his first NFL start in the Titans' season-opening loss to the Minnesota Vikings. He finished the game with five carries for three yards and two receptions for 41 yards.[75] During Week 8, Henry scored his first NFL touchdown on a 6-yard rush in a 36–22 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars. He finished the game with 16 carries for a then career-high 60 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown and four catches for 37 yards.[76] On December 18, 2016, he had nine rushing attempts for 58 rushing yards and a season-high two rushing touchdowns in a 19–17 road victory over the Kansas City Chiefs.[77] During the season finale against the Houston Texans, he ran for a then-career-high 65 rushing yards on 15 carries and scored a touchdown in the 24–17 victory.[78] Henry finished his rookie season with 110 carries for 490 yards (both sixth among NFL rookies in 2016) and five touchdowns in 15 games and two starts.[79] He also caught 13 passes for 137 yards.[80] For most of the 2017 season, Henry split carries with DeMarco Murray and run-oriented quarterback Marcus Mariota. During Week 2, Henry ran for 92 yards and a touchdown on 14 carries in a 37–16 road victory against the Jaguars.[81] On October 16, 2017, on Monday Night Football, Henry ran for a then career-best 131 yards on 19 carries, including a 72-yard touchdown late in the fourth quarter of the 36–22 victory over the Indianapolis Colts. In addition, he had a 14-yard reception in the victory.[82] During Week 13, Henry ran for 109 yards on 11 carries and beat his longest rush of the year with a 75-yard rushing touchdown late in the fourth quarter of the 24–13 victory over the Texans.[83] In the regular season finale against the Jaguars, Henry caught his first receiving touchdown on a 66-yard reception from Marcus Mariota in the 15–10 victory.[84] The Titans finished second in the AFC South with a 9–7 record and made the playoffs as a Wild Card team.[85][86] In the Wild Card Round, the Titans played the Chiefs. Because DeMarco Murray was out with a knee injury, Henry got the start.[87] In a 22–21 road victory, Henry had the best performance of his career up to that point, rushing for 156 yards and a touchdown on 23 carries and catching two passes for 35 yards.[88] His 191 yards-from-scrimmage was a franchise record. In the Divisional Round against the New England Patriots, Henry had 28 rushing yards and 21 receiving yards in the 35–14 road loss.[89] Henry finished the regular season with 176 carries for 744 rushing yards and five touchdowns in 15 games and two starts. He also caught 11 passes for 136 yards and a touchdown. In the postseason, Henry ran for 184 yards and a touchdown on 35 carries and caught five passes for 56 yards.[90] During the 2018 offseason, Matt LaFleur was hired as the Titans' new offensive coordinator and the team also acquired running back Dion Lewis.[91] Lewis's pass-catching ability was seen as a fit for LaFleur's offensive scheme, which often employed running backs to catch passes out of the backfield, and leading to success with Todd Gurley in the previous season as offensive coordinator with the Rams.[92] This led to speculation that LaFleur would favor Lewis over Henry.[93] Henry ended up splitting carries with Lewis and run-oriented quarterback Marcus Mariota for most of the 2018 season. During Week 2, Henry recorded an eight-yard pass completion, the first of his career, to wide receiver Taywan Taylor in the Titans' 20–17 victory over the Texans.[94] He also had 18 carries in that game and the next against the Jaguars, but was used much less frequently through the middle of the season. From Weeks 4–13, Henry averaged nine carries for only 37 yards per game, and never rushed for over 60 yards.[80] This all changed in Week 14 against the Jaguars. In the second quarter, Henry had a 99-yard touchdown run, fending off three tacklers, tying him with Tony Dorsett for the longest NFL touchdown run. He finished the game with four rushing touchdowns and 238 rushing yards on 17 carries, breaking Chris Johnson's franchise record of 228 yards in 2009.[95][96][97] He also became the ninth player in NFL history to record a 200+ yard and 4+ touchdown game, and the first to do so on fewer than 22 carries.[98] His 238 rushing yards were the most by any player for a single game for the 2018 season.[99] Henry was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week due to his spectacular performance.[100] During Week 15, the Titans went on the road to face the New York Giants. In a cold and rainy game, Henry led the NFL in rushing for the second consecutive week with 170 yards and two touchdowns on a career-high 33 carries, along with a one-yard reception and six-yard pass completion in the 17–0 shutout.[101] In Weeks 16 and 17, he combined for 177 rushing yards and a touchdown in the two games against the Washington Redskins and Colts.[102][103] He was later named the AFC Offensive Player of the Month for December.[104] Henry finished the 2018 season with 1,059 rushing yards and 12 touchdowns along with 15 receptions for 99 yards.[105] After the season, he was ranked 99th on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2019.[106] In the 2019 season opener against the Cleveland Browns, Henry rushed 19 times for 84 yards and a touchdown. He also caught one pass for a 75-yard touchdown as the Titans won on the road 43–13.[107] During Week 2 against the Colts, he rushed 15 times for 81 yards and a touchdown as the Titans narrowly lost 19–17.[108] Two weeks later against the Atlanta Falcons, Henry had his first 100-yard game of the season when he rushed for 100 yards on 27 carries in a 24–10 road victory.[109] In the next game against the Buffalo Bills, he rushed for 78 yards and a touchdown as the Titans lost by a score of 14–7.[110] After a season-low 28 yards in a Week 6 shutout loss to the Denver Broncos, Henry sank to 12th in the league in rushing, over 200 yards behind the league leaders he would eventually catch.[111] Henry responded with 90 rushing yards and a touchdown in a 23–20 victory against the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 7.[112] During Week 9 against the Carolina Panthers, Henry rushed 13 times for 63 yards and a touchdown and caught three passes for 36 yards and a touchdown in the 30–20 road loss.[113] In the next game against the Chiefs, he finished with 188 rushing yards and two touchdowns as the Titans narrowly won 35–32.[114] Henry won the FedEx Ground Player of the Week for his efforts.[115] During a Jaguars rematch in Week 12 after a Week 11 bye, Henry had a 74-yard rushing touchdown in the third quarter. Overall, he finished the 42–20 victory with 159 rushing yards and two touchdowns along with one reception for 16 yards.[116] In the next game, a rematch against the Colts, he rushed 26 times for 149 yards and a touchdown in the 31–17 road victory.[117] During Week 14 against the Oakland Raiders, Henry ran for 103 yards and two touchdowns in the 42–21 road victory.[118] During the regular-season finale against the Texans, Henry finished with 211 rushing yards and three touchdowns as the Titans won 35–14 and made it to the playoffs as a Wild Card team. During the game, Henry narrowly won the 2019 rushing title over Nick Chubb of the Cleveland Browns, with the winning rush being a 53-yard touchdown run.[119] This was Henry's first career rushing crown and the first Titan to win it since Chris Johnson in 2009.[120] Henry finished the regular season setting career-highs in carries with 303, rushing yards with 1,540, and rushing touchdowns with 16, which all led the league, despite only playing in 15 games, missing the Week 16 game against the New Orleans Saints due to a hamstring injury.[121] He also set career-highs in receptions with 16, receiving yards with 206, and receiving touchdowns with two.[122] On December 17, 2019, he was selected to his first Pro Bowl.[123] On January 3, 2020, he was named to the second-team All-Pro at both the running back and flex position, both behind Christian McCaffrey.[124] He was ranked 10th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2020.[125] With the Titans finishing the season 9–7, the team narrowly clinched a wild card spot for the #6 seed. In the Wild Card Round against the defending Super Bowl champion Patriots, which was played on his 26th birthday, Henry rushed for over 100 yards and a touchdown in the first half, finishing with 182 yards (the most ever against a Bill Belichick-led team, and the third most ever in a postseason road game) and a 22-yard reception in the 20–13 road victory. Henry became the first rushing champion with a 100-yard playoff game since Terrell Davis in 1998, the first to win a playoff game since LaDainian Tomlinson in 2007, and the second Titan with multiple post-season 100+ rushing games.[126] He also broke his own franchise record for most yards-from-scrimmage with 204.[127] During the Divisional Round against the Baltimore Ravens, Henry rushed 30 times for 195 yards and threw a three-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Corey Davis in the 28–12 road victory.[128] He became the second player in NFL history with three postseason games with at least 150 rushing yards, joining Terrell Davis, who had four. In addition, he became the only player with at least 175 rushing yards in consecutive games. Davis is the only other with two such games in a career.[129] In the AFC Championship against the Chiefs, Henry was mostly held in check. During the game, he rushed 19 times for 69 yards and a touchdown in the 35–24 road loss.[130] On March 16, 2020, the Titans placed the franchise tag on Henry.[131] He signed the tag on April 2, 2020.[132] Henry signed a new four-year $50 million contract with the team on July 15, 2020.[133] Despite leading the league in rushing yards for most of the first four weeks of the 2020 season, Henry was limited to no more than 3.7 yards per carry for all but one of them. These struggles ended in the week 6 game against the Texans, Henry finished with 212 rushing yards, 52 receiving yards, and two touchdowns (including a 94-yard rushing touchdown). In overtime, he finished the game with a five-yard touchdown to end the game as the Titans won 42–36.[134] Henry was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance in Week 6.[135] He was also named AFC Offensive Player of the Month for October after racking up 399 scrimmage yards with 344 yards rushing and five touchdowns.[136] During a Week 8 31–20 road loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, he ran for 112 yards and a touchdown.[137] In Week 11 against the Ravens, Henry had 133 rushing yards and the game-winning touchdown in overtime to defeat the Ravens on the road 30–24.[138][139] In a 45–26 road victory against the Colts in Week 12, Henry had 27 carries for 178 rushing yards and three touchdowns.[140] In Week 14 against the Jaguars, Henry rushed 26 times for 215 yards and two touchdowns during the 31–10 victory.[141] In Week 15 against the Detroit Lions, Henry rushed for 147 yards and a touchdown during the 46–25 win.[142] In Week 17 against the Houston Texans, Henry rushed for a career-high 250 rushing yards and two touchdowns during the 41–38 road victory.[143] Henry was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance.[144] During the game, Henry became the eighth running back in NFL history to surpass 2,000 rushing yards.[145] This also made him the only player to have 2,000 yard rushing seasons in high school, college, and the NFL.[146] In addition to his 2,027 rushing yards, Henry established career highs in carries (378), yards-per-carry (5.4) and rushing touchdowns (17).

[197] Standing at 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) tall and weighing 247 pounds (112 kg), Henry is much larger than most running backs and has a frame comparable to that of a linebacker.[198] Henry is a \"power back\", using his large size and strength to overpower defenders, stiff arm and break tackles. In 2020, he accumulated 1,073 yards after contact, over 300 yards more than any running back in the league, and led the league in broken tackles with 34.[199] He couples that strength and size with surprising speed relative to his size.[200] Henry is adept at using the stiff-arm to repel defenders, with it being described as his \"signature\".[201][202] As a power back, his playing style contrasts with those of smaller, so-called \"scat backs\", who have greater elusiveness due to their faster ability to change directions. Henry is not usually used as a pass catcher, but he makes up for his lack of productiveness as a pass-catcher using his dominance as a pure runner.[199] Observers have also noted that Henry has a tendency to get better, particularly in yards per carry, in the later stages of a game, as his strength and toughness wears down opponents.[203] Henry's successful running game has also permitted the offense success with play-action.[204] In 2018, Henry fulfilled a promise to his grandmother by graduating from Alabama with a bachelor's degree in communications.[215] In November 2019, Henry's hometown of Yulee, Florida, celebrated him with a welcome sign in his honor. Fundraising for the sign came from local residents and businesses.[216] Henry has been in a relationship with Adrianna Rivas since 2016. They have two daughters.[217][218] Italics denotes active player",

                "content": "Manchester City thrashed West Ham United 4-1 in the Premier League on Saturday for their first back-to-back wins since October thanks to two goals from Erling Haaland and one of their best all-around performances in weeks. The reigning champions are sixth in the table on 34 points, 11 behind leaders Liverpool who have two games in hand. The Hammers, who were coming off a 5-0 rout by Liverpool six days earlier, are 13th with 23 points. City got on the scoresheet in the 10th minute when United defender Vladimir Coufal deflected Savinho’s angled shot into the far corner. Haaland bagged his first in the 42nd minute when Savinho whipped in a long cross that the big Norwegian leapt sideways to head in. Haaland notched his second shortly after the break when Savinho sent a through ball that the 24-year-old nonchalantly chipped over goalkeeper Alphonse Areola. Phil Foden padded City’s lead in the 58th minute before Niclas Fullkrug pulled a late goal back for the Hammers, but the game was already well out of reach. Follow all the action from the Etihad Stadium with our live blog below: Man City host West Ham in the Premier League 71’ GOAL! Fullkrug pulls one back for the Hammers (MCI 4-1 WHU) 58’ GOAL! Foden makes it four as City run riot (MCI 4-0 WHU) 55’ GOAL! Haaland adds a third as City cruise further ahead (MCI 3-0 WHU) 42’ GOAL! Haaland meets Savinho’s pass to double lead (MCI 2-0 WHU) 10’ GOAL! Savinho strikes from the right and the ball deflects in (MCI 1-0 WHU) Manchester City FC 4 - 1 West Ham United FC 16:58 Manchester City cruise to victory after early resistance from West Ham, winning 4-1 at the Etihad Stadium thanks to two goals in either half. Despite looking the more dynamic side in the opening period of play, the Hammers were punished for a lack of clinical finishing and were undone at the other end just 10 minutes in, when Savinho’s shot was turned past Areola by an unwitting Coufal. Despite more good work from Lopetegui’s side in the interim, they were pegged back once again three minutes from half-time, with Haaland leaping to connect with Savinho’s cross to double City’s advantage. Within a quarter-hour of the restart, West Ham found themselves 4-0 behind, thanks to a second goal from Haaland - and assist from Savinho - before a mistake in possession allowed De Bruyne to set Foden up with a close-range finish. The visitors did manage to pull one back through Fullkrug’s second goal of the season with 19 minutes to play but it was too little, too late for the Irons, who lose by three goals despite closer-than-expected xG totals, with Guardiola’s team leading the way 1.97 to 1.19. The three points keeps Manchester City in sixth place in the league, and they’ll host Salford City next weekend in the FA Cup. West Ham stay 13th and have Premier League opponents coming up in the FA cup, as they travel to play Aston Villa in six days. That concludes our commentary of the Premier League fixture between Manchester City and West Ham - we hope you’ve enjoyed it! 16:56 Manchester City are looking to run out the clock in an effort to see out the three-goal victory, with Guardiola eager to register back-to-back victories in any competition for the first time since October 2024. West Ham, on the other hand, will likely fall to two-consecutive losses for the first time since the beginning of December, when they were defeated by Arsenal and Leicester City. 16:56 FULL-TIME: MANCHESTER CITY 4-1 WEST HAM 16:53 Foden plays a pass across the face of the 18-yard box for Grealish with Silva running the opposite direction to draw defenders away, but the England international is unable to hit the target after stepping inside, with his right-footed shot blocked behind for a corner by a combination of Coufal and Mavropanos. 16:50 The fourth official indicates six minutes will be added to the end of the match for stoppages. 16:50 Haaland has scored nine goals in just six Premier League games against West Ham including today, with 33.3 per cent of those strikes coming at the Etihad Stadium. 16:45 Substitution Edson Omar Álvarez Velázquez Daniel William John Ings 16:45 JUST WIDE! Alvarez shows off his footwork, dribbling past Walker in a tight area before leaving the ball for Paqueta, whose first-time shot is blazed wide of the post! 16:43 Paqueta’s outswinging corner finds the unmarked Soucek 14 yards from goal, but the captain fails to hit the target with his header. 16:43 Substitution Erling Braut Haaland Jack Peter Grealish 16:42 Paqueta plays a long ball over the top of the Manchester City defence from inside his own half for Fullkrug, who latches onto it before holding up play ahead of two centre-backs and laying it off to Summerville. The winger attempts an acrobatic, off-balance effort from close range but it fails to come off, with Ortega not called into action. 16:39 McAtee is given 10 minutes to impress, with Savinho given an early rest after an impressive performance. 16:39 Guilherme’s cross towards the penalty spot is chested down by Fullkrug, allowing Wan-Bissaka to strike the ball from 20 yards out, but the full-back drives his wild effort wide of the near post. 16:37 Carson has retaken his place on the bench as Ortega looks capable of continuing - at least for now - with the starting goalkeeper keen to see out the game. 16:35 With Ortega on the ground receiving treatment, and Ederson unavailable due to injury, 39-year-old Carson is getting prepared to warm up on the touchline, with his presence a potential necessity in the last quarter-hour of the game. The situation draws a wry smile from the backup goalkeeper, who hasn’t featured since the 2020/21 season. 16:33 Looking to capitalise on the momentum, Coufal gets forward down the right and hangs an inviting cross to the far post for Soucek, who nods the ball back into the six-yard box for Fullkrug. Ortega is first on the scene and gets two hands to the ball but leaps over the back of the striker to do so, before landing awkwardly. 16:30 Substitution Mohammed Kudus Luis Guilherme Lira dos Santos 16:29 Goal Niclas Füllkrug 16:29 Summerville floats a cross-cum-shot towards the back post but he fails to hit the target while also sending the ball just above the head of the awaiting Kudus - giving Ortega a goal-kick. 16:27 Paqueta cleverly chips a pass over the top of the Manchester City defence for Soucek, who lunges forward to poke the ball towards goal. Ortega manages to time his step to perfection though and blocks the effort with his chest, while also pushing it to safety to prevent a follow-up chance. 16:24 JUST OVER! Paqueta steps up and curls his left-footed free-kick up and over the wall, but the ball fails to come back down in time and lands on the roof of the goal! 16:23 In 2024, West Ham conceded more goals than any other Premier League side (79), finishing the year with a 5-0 home defeat against Liverpool. 16:22 Yellow Card Kyle Andrew Walker 16:21 It looks to be a long way back for West Ham, who haven’t been able to replicate any of the positives from the first half, while making a number of mistakes that has led to an even greater deficit. They’ve seen more of the ball since the restart but done less with it, firing just three shots to an xG of 0.09 in the quarter-hour since the second-half kicked off. 16:20 Substitution Nathan Benjamin Aké Kyle Andrew Walker 16:20 Substitution Mateo Kovačić İlkay Gündoğan 16:17 Assist Kevin De Bruyne 16:17 Haaland has scored his 16th goal of the Premier League this season, more than any other Manchester City player, while netting twice in the same game for the first time since September 14 against Brentford. 16:16 Goal Philip Walter Foden 16:14 Goal Erling Braut Haaland 16:13 Play is brought to a halt for Haaland, who is down on the pitch holding a very sensitive area after holding the ball up for Silva in midfield. He’s eventually able to climb back to his feet but he looks to be in some discomfort as he attempts to run off the issue. 16:12 Substitution Jean-Clair Dimitri Roger Todibo Konstantinos Mavropanos 16:10 Coufal fires a first-time shot towards the goal after Kudus’ shot is blocked from close range by Gvardiol, but Ortega throws up an arm to block the strike, while keeping the ball in play. 16:08 West Ham have conceded 21 first-half goals in 20 games, only Southampton (22) and Leicester City (22) have conceded more in the Premier League this season. 16:06 Alvarez’s cross from a central position to the edge of the six-yard box is headed on by Summerville ahead of Lewis, but the winger can only pop his effort up to provide Ortega with an easy catch. 16:04 West Ham get the match restarted from the kick-off! 15:52 West Ham are left with little alternative but to open up and attack as they continue to search for a way back in the game. The absence of Bowen is an issue for the attack, but Soler and Ings - who could make his 400th appearance in club football - are options off the bench for Lopetegui; especially as Fullkrug has already been booked. Guardiola will be keen for a second clean sheet in-a-row and could introduce veterans Gundogan and Walker to see out the result in the second half, while Doku is a likely entrant to stretch the pitch late in place of Foden. 15:50 Manchester City take a two-goal advantage into the half-time interval at the Etihad Stadium, leading West Ham 2-0, though it has been a much tighter match than the score line suggests. The visitors started the brighter of the two sides and fashioned two half-chances within the first nine minutes, with Kudus looking a lively outlet on the right flank, but they were unable to make the most of their opportunities, and were duly punished at the other end with Coufal’s own goal at the 10th minute following Savinho’s shot. While the lead seemed to give the hosts confidence, they were unable to completely shut down their opponents, who continued to trouble on the counter-attack , only to be let down by their finishing. Areola made a couple of good saves to end the half but it wasn’t enough, as Haaland popped up with three minutes to go and outjumped Kilman to win a back-post header and double City’s lead. Despite being outproduced in xG for large parts of the half, Guardiola’s side lead in the metric 0.95 to 0.52, after having taken the lead with an expected goals of just 0.02. 15:48 HALF-TIME: MANCHESTER CITY 2-0 WEST HAM 15:47 The fourth official indicates one minute will be added to the end of the half for stoppages. 15:43 Assist Sávio Moreira de Oliveira 15:43 Wan-Bissaka curls a deep cross to the far post from the left wing for Soucek, but it’s easily cleared by the head of Gvardiol. 15:41 GOOD SHOT - BETTER SAVE! Savinho uses close control to dribble into the penalty area before playing a square pass to an unmarked Lewis 20 yards from goal. With time and space, the full-back winds up and places a powerful shot to the top corner but Areola leaps across his line and claws the ball away with two hands! 15:38 Manchester City have won all eight of their Premier League home games against West Ham under Pep Guardiola – only Arsene Wenger has a better 100 per cent home win rate against an opponent in the competition (11/11 vs Leicester, 10/10 vs Stoke). 15:37 Having worked out Manchester City’s tactics, Summerville immediately charges forward after De Bruyne plays his corner short to Savinho and intercepts the return before sprinting away on the counter. After spotting Kudus in support, he squares the ball to his team-mate, who fails to hit the target with his shot thanks in part to Foden closing down the angle. 15:35 GREAT WORK FROM AREOLA! De Bruyne threads a pass through the West Ham defence for Haaland, who gets into the penalty area before cutting back to play the ball square to Silva. Unmarked, the Portugal international lashes a first-time effort towards goal through the legs of Wan-Bissaka, but Areola gets down quickly and manages to make the save with his legs! 15:33 Savinho gets to the edge of Areola’s penalty area and looks to have a shot but he slips during his dispatch, which provides the West Ham goalkeeper with an easy save. 15:30 CHANCE! Paqueta finds himself in a pocket of space 20 yards from goal and turns before dragging a left-footed shot through the crowd of bodies and wide of the far post! 15:29 Kovacic’s poorly timed sliding challenge through the back of Summerville inside the centre-circle earns the Croatia international a yellow card. 15:28 West Ham have conceded at least once in each of their last 24 Premier League games against Manchester City – only against Sunderland have they had a longer run without a clean sheet in their league history (25 between 1923 and 1968), a run they ended with an 8-0 win with Geoff Hurst scoring six goals. 15:26 Wan-Bissaka and Paqueta play a lovely give-and-go inside Manchester City’s 18-yard box, with the full-back teasing a lovely pass back to the penalty spot, but no West Ham player in the area gambles to attack the delivery, allowing Savinho to calmly dribble the ball away. 15:24 Summerville looks to be through on goal, with the entire Manchester City half at his mercy after the winger storms through to steal the ball from Akanji following a free-kick, but referee Michael Salisbury blows his whistle for a foul during the tackle - much to the frustration of the visiting players. 15:23 West Ham again look to play it out from the back, taking a risk as they draw in the Manchester City press, but again Kudus is a lively outlet down the flank, attacking Soucek’s hurried pass before beating Kovacic to the ball to force a sliding clearance. 15:20 Despite taking the lead after just 10 minutes, Manchester City still technically haven’t had a shot on target, creating an xG of just 0.02 for their lead, while West Ham are forced to search for an equaliser after an output of 0.33. 15:18 From the left, De Bruyne this time plays a pass to Savinho from the corner-kick before sweeping a first-time cross into the 18-yard box that’s met by Kilman’s clearing header. 15:17 Savinho again gets the better of Coufal and plays a low pass into the penalty area looking for the run of Silva at the near post, but a sliding Soucek puts it behind for a third Manchester City corner. 15:15 Yellow Card Niclas Füllkrug 15:14 De Bruyne and Silva attempt a short-corner routine, but Coufal and Soucek are quick to leave their posts and defend, eventually poking the ball behind for a second set-piece. 15:11 SOUCEK CAN’T TEST ORTEGA! Again Kudus is causing issues down the right flank, providing an option for Coufal as he drives towards the byline before cutting back a low cross to the penalty spot for the unmarked Soucek. With time and space, the Czechia international goes for it at the first time of asking but drags his effort wide! 15:10 Own goal Vladimír Coufal 15:08 SIDE-NETTING! Building out from the back, West Ham manage to suck their opponents in before hitting on the counter, with Fullkrug and Summerville linking up to play Kudus into the penalty area, but the Ghana international is unable to find the target with his right-footed shot from close range, sending his effort into the side of the goal! 15:07 Paqueta’s volleyed pass out to the right flank for Kudus is tracked down by the winger, who takes on Gvardiol before attempting a cross that’s easily blocked by the recovering defender. 15:04 Haaland drops back to receive Ake’s pass and play one-touch football with Kovacic, but the offside flag is immediately raised - giving West Ham a chance to regain possession in midfield. 15:03 Foden slips a pass to the byline from a position deep on the right wing looking for the incisive run of Lewis, who keeps the ball in play before digging out an off-balance cross that hits the side-netting. 15:01 Manchester City get the match under way from the kick-off! 14:48 West Ham make four alterations from the side that lost 5-0 to Liverpool on Sunday. Todibo is preferred to Mavropanos in defence, while Soucek gets the nod in midfield ahead of Soler. Summerville replaces the uninvolved Emerson Palmieri on the left flank and in attack, an injury to Jarrod Bowen sees Fullkrug lead the line. 14:48 Manchester City name an unchanged XI from the side that beat Leicester City six days ago. Ortega keeps his place between the posts behind a defence consisting of Gvardiol, Ake, Akanji and Lewis. Kovacic sits in midfield behind Silva and De Bruyne, while Savinho and Foden look to supply Haaland from the wings. 14:48 WEST HAM SUBS: Aaron Cresswell, Carlos Soler, Konstantinos Mavropanos, Luis Guilherme, Danny Ings, Wes Foderingham, Guido Rodriguez, Andy Irving, Ollie Scarles. 14:48 WEST HAM XI (4-2-3-1): Alphonse Areola; Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Maximilian Kilman, Jean-Clair Todibo, Vladimir Coufal; Tomas Soucek, Edson Alvarez; Crysencio Summerville, Lucas Paqueta, Mohammed Kudus; Niclas Fullkrug. 14:48 MANCHESTER CITY SUBS: Kyle Walker, Jack Grealish, Jeremy Doku, Ilkay Gundogan, Matheus Nunes, Scott Carson, Jahmai Simpson-Pusey, Nico O’Reilly, James McAtee. 14:48 MANCHESTER CITY XI (4-1-4-1): Stefan Ortega; Josko Gvardiol, Nathan Ake, Manuel Akanji, Rico Lewis; Mateo Kovacic; Savinho, Bernardo Silva, Kevin De Bruyne, Phil Foden; Erling Haaland. 14:48 With 15 minutes to go before kick-off, let’s take a look at how the two sides are lining up - starting with our hosts! 14:37 West Ham's 5-0 defeat at the hands of Liverpool ended a run of four straight games without defeat for Julen Lopetegui's side, who managed eight points in that time. Sitting in 13th position - just one above Manchester United - the Hammers will be eager to take to the pitch after Tottenham's loss earlier today, which gives them the opportunity to finish the day in 11th should they manage a first league win against Manchester City since September 2015. 14:32 Manchester City's 2-0 win over Leicester City last time out was just their second victory in their last 14 fixtures in all competitions and left them in sixth place; four points behind Chelsea for the final Champions League spot and 14 off league-leading Liverpool. Looking to get back to the form that saw them win the Premier League each of the last four seasons, Pep Guardiola could not have hand-picked a better opponent, as Manchester City have beaten today’s opponents in every one of their last five meetings, with each of the last three games ending 3-1. 14:32 Hello and welcome to our LIVE commentary of the Premier League fixture between Manchester City and West Ham! 13:51 , Mike Jones Man City XI: Ortega Moreno, Lewis, Akanji, Ake, Gvardiol, Kovacic, De Bruyne, Bernardo, Savinho, Foden, Haaland Your first City XI of 2025 🩵XI | Ortega Moreno, Lewis, Akanji, Ake, Gvardiol, Kovacic, De Bruyne (C), Bernardo, Savinho, Foden, HaalandSUBS | Carson, Walker, Grealish, Doku, Gundogan, Nunes, Simpson-Pusey, O'Reilly, McAtee#ManCity | @etihad pic.twitter.com/lxOUCTmSLw — Manchester City (@ManCity) January 4, 2025 West Ham XI: Areola, Coufal, Todibo, Kilman, Wan-Bissaka, Alvarez, Soucek, Paqueta, Kudos, Fullkrug, Summerville Starting 2025 like this 👇 pic.twitter.com/z7SojQ32oW — West Ham United (@WestHam) January 4, 2025 13:00 Follow all the goals and latest action from the Premier League here with The Independent.

                "title": "City overpower West Ham to usher in 2025 in winning style",
                "content": "Men's Team Haaland struck either side of the break and in the process became the third highest Premier League scorer at the Etihad, extending his tally to 46 overall. Both goals were set up by the impressive Savinho who had had earlier helped fire City ahead, his 10th minute shot being deflected in by Coufal. Foden’s 66th minute effort then helped add the gloss to a memorable afternoon that saw skipper Kevin De Bruyne chalk up his 400th City career appearance. Though Niklas Fullkrug struck on 71 minutes for the visitors it proved little more than a consolation effort. Victory also made it back-to-back wins for Pep Guardiola’s side to ensure we began the New Year in ideal style. With snow and ice forecast later in the day there was a cold, chilly backdrop to the game as the action got underway. In what was our first game of 2025, City had stepped out looking to build on the momentum of last weekend’s 2-0 win at Leicester. STRIKE ONE: Vladimir Coufal deflects Savinho's effort into the West Ham goal. Men's Team However, it was the Hammers who created the game’s first opening on six minutes, a quickfire break stretching City’s backline with Mohammed Kudus bursting through on the right edge of the box. Fortunately, however the Ghanaian could only drill a 12-yard shot into the side netting. There was another warning for City three minutes later as another visitors’ attack ended with Thomas Soucek drilling a shot wide from an inviting Kudus assist. It was a wake-up call – and City responded in exemplary fashion by taking a 10th minute lead with our first meaningful attack of the game via a Coufal own goal. Savinho was the architect, the Brazilian winger firing an angled effort in from the left edge of the box and the ball took a crucial defection off Coufal to wrong foot Hammers’ keeper Alphonse Areola and fire City ahead. SLIDE RULE: Savinho gets the celebrations started after City's opener. Men's Team There was then another heart in the mouth moment when the dangerous Crysencio Summerville broke clear of Manuel Akanji and looked to be one on one with Stefan Ortega. However, referee Michael Salisbury blew for a foul on the Swiss defender – much to the Etihad’s relief. A bursting run by Josko Gvardiol on the half hour got the Etihad crowd on their feet again but from the resulting lay-off a low dipping Savinho effort was gratefully gobbled up by Areola. Two minutes later a wonderful City move almost resulted in a second goal. A pinpoint De Bruyne ball picked out the advancing Haaland. The Norwegian squared the ball back to the advancing Bernardo Silva in the centre of the Hammers box whose goal bound shot was somehow kept out by Areola’s legs. And the Hammers keeper then earned his spurs again on 38 minutes spectacularly diving to his right to keep out an arcing Rico Lewis effort. DRIVING FORCE: Phil Foden powers through for City. Men's Team City were not to be denied however and a second goal arrived on 42 minutes via the familiar figure of Haaland. The impressive Savinho was again the architect, the Brazilian latching onto a fine Foden ball before then powering past Coufal on the left flank and delivering a quite wonderful looping cross to the back post. Haaland needed no second invitation to leap and guide home what was his 45th league goal at the Etihad. It was a crucial cushion for the Blues but five minutes after the restart came a reminder that there was work still to be done, Ortega needing to be alert to deal with a Coufal effort after a fine initial drive by Summerville. Once again that alert sparked the perfect response – and once more it was the Savinho/Haaland combo that did the trick on 56 minutes. A brilliant Savinho through ball sliced the Hammers defence open and put Haaland in the clear. THE BOSS: Pep Guardiola looks on. Club News The City striker rounded Areola before despatching the most delicate of chips for his second and City’s third – with Haaland in the process also becoming the third highest Premier League scorer at the Etihad. One sensed the Hammers’ resistance starting to dissipate and within two minutes City further extended our lead through Foden. De Bruyne seized onto an errant West Ham pass before teeing up Foden who made no mistake from 12 yards. To their credit, the Hammers kept pushing with Ortega needing to be alert to deny Soucek on 67 minutes. And their persistence paid off when they finally breached the City back line on 71 minutes, Fullkrug firing home from Soucek’s inviting pass. However that effort failed to take the gloss off what was an ideal way to kick-start the New Year for the reigning champions. ON CLOUD NINE: Erling Haaland and Savinho celebrate after City's second goal. Features CITY XI: Ortega Moreno, Lewis, Akanji, Ake (Walker 61), Gvardiol, Kovacic (Gundogan 61), De Bruyne (C), Bernardo, Savinho (McAtee 81), Foden, Haaland (Grealish 83) Subs: Carson, Doku, Nunes, Simpson-Pusey, O’Reilly WEST HAM XI: Areola, Coufal, Todibo (Mavropanos 53), Kilman, Wan-Bissaka, Alvarez, Soucek (C), Paqueta, Kudus, Fullkrug, Summerville Subs: Foderingham, Cresswell, Soler, Guilherme, Ings, Rodriguez, Irving, Scarles Att: 52, 737. TREBLE YELL: Erling Haaland is all smiles after City's third goal. Features For the second game running Savinho again really caught the eye with a vibrant display of attacking wing play. With his confidence buoyed by his first goal for the Club at Leicester last weekend, the Brazilian picked up where he had left off. It was his drive and shot that led to City’s opener via Coufal’s deflection. And Savinho then delivered a quite stunning cross to set up Haaland’s header before following suit with a sublime pass for Erling’s second and City’s third. It all augurs well looking to the rest of the season and beyond. FOUR PLAY: Phil Foden makes it 4-0 in clinical fashion. EDS & Academy The sight of the West Ham defence seems to bring the best out of Erling Haaland! His brace today marked the Norwegian striker’s eighth and ninth Premier League strikes against the Londoners in just six appearances and also took his overall league tally at the Etihad to 46. That elevated him to third in the all-time Premier League tally of Etihad goal scorers. Not too shabby! We are not in our level. We won and we are so happy. We are judged on results and our performance was not good. We work and the first minute they deserve to be 0-1 or 0-2. We ran a lot and were composed with the ball. Very pleased with the result but now you cannot ask me if the old City is back because we were not. Savinho doesn’t think too much in his head. When you are many years here players think they deserve something special for what they have done. That is a big mistake. Savinho has everything to win and prove. Having old fashioned football with left on the left and right on the right, helps the kind of striker we have. He has a lot to improve but right now he has something special to help the team. The goal was lucky but two assists were brilliant. It is a little step. Moments we played good. I think it was much better against Leicester. We lost some energy but there were some improvements so that is alright. We understand a bit more what we have done in the last 10 years and how hard it is. At the moment we are a bit below that. We are working really hard and the team is coming back fitness wise. There were moments we played well, other moments less. It’s a bit of an improvement but we understand it still has to be better. You don’t put yourself down too much. We have not been at this level this year. Everybody said, ‘City are winning all the time, it must be easy,’ it is not. Victory sees City remain in sixth place in the Premier League table. Pep Guardiola’s side now have 34 points from 20 games and lie a point behind fifth placed Newcastle United. The focus switches to the FA Cup for our next match. City are back at the Etihad a week today on Saturday, January 11 when we play host to Salford City in the third round of the Cup. Kick-off at the Etihad is slated for 17.45 (UK).

He finished the game with 62 total yards.[21] In Week 17, after scoring a 75-yard touchdown against the Miami Dolphins, Flowers set a Ravens franchise record for most receptions (77) and receiving yards (858) by a rookie.[22] In the fourth quarter of the AFC Championship Game against the Kansas City Chiefs, Flowers fumbled at the goal line and the Chiefs recovered the ball in the end zone for a touchback. This occurred after getting a 15-yard taunting penalty earlier in the drive.[23] Flowers finished the game with five receptions for 115 yards and a touchdown as the Ravens lost 10–17.[24] In Week 2 against the Las Vegas Raiders, Flowers had 7 catches for 91 yards and a touchdown in the 26–23 loss.[25] In Week 5 against the Cincinnati Bengals, Flowers led the Ravens with 7 catches for 111 yards in the 41–38 comeback overtime win.

                "content": "Editorial Director Leading Ravens Pro Bowl wide receiver Zay Flowers suffered a knee injury in the regular-season finale against the Cleveland Browns. After the game, Head Coach John Harbaugh said it's something \"he has a chance to be OK with.\" Harbaugh said he will know more after an MRI tomorrow. He was originally ruled questionable to return, but ruled out at the start of the second half. Flowers grabbed for his knee after making a 12-yard catch in the second quarter. Flowers' knee was hit hard by Browns linebacker Mohamoud Diabate as Flowers went to the ground. After being tended to by trainers, Flowers got up and walked off the field under his own power with a slight limp. He first went to the blue tent, then was taken to the locker room. Flowers leads the Ravens with 74 catches for 1,059 yards this season, earning his first Pro Bowl accolades. Flowers has not missed a game due to injury yet in his two-year career. Fellow starting wide receiver Rashod Bateman took a big hit earlier in the game from safety Juan Thornhill but returned on the next play after being seen by trainers. The Ravens overcame an 0-2 start and overcame the Steelers down the stretch. Lamar Jackson became the first player in NFL history to hit 4,000 passing yards and 800 rushing yards in a single season. The 355-pound nose tackle had the Ravens sideline going nuts after his pick. The jury on the 2024 Ravens is now in session. Zay Flowers' status is uncertain. Derrick Henry continues to roll. Baltimore's defense is shining heading into the postseason. The Ravens will host a Wild-Card game after their 35-10 win over the Browns. As division winners, the Ravens will host the Texans and Rams and travel to Kansas City. The Ravens host the Browns at 4:30 p.m. on Saturday. Ravens starting left guard Patrick Mekari is active while Jameis Winston is designated as Cleveland's emergency No. 3 quarterback. Needing a victory to clinch the AFC North, the Ravens (11-5) host the Cleveland Browns (3-13) on Saturday afternoon in the regular season finale. Pro Bowl snub may fuel Kyle Van Noy during playoffs. Derrick Henry has over 300 carries and looks as fresh as Week 1. Ravens fans should pull for these teams in the final week of the regular season. Copyright © 2025 Baltimore Ravens.

The Baltimore Ravens lost one of their key offensive contributors in Week 18 against the Cleveland Browns with wide receiver Zay Flowers going down with a knee injury. Flowers is believed to have suffered a sprain, according to NFL Media, which added there is a real chance that Flowers could miss Baltimore's wild-card round matchup against either the Steelers or Chargers. Flowers will undergo an MRI to confirm his status. Early in the second quarter, Flowers caught a short pass toward the left sideline from quarterback Lamar Jackson, and at the tail end of his 12-yard gain, Flowers tumbled to the ground and grabbed his knee. The Ravens initially listed him as questionable to return with a knee injury, but they ruled him out as the second half began. WR Zay Flowers (knee) has been ruled out for the rest of the game. The Ravens (12-5) played their starters on Saturday since a win against the Cleveland Browns (3-14) would clinch the AFC North division title and the AFC's No. 3 postseason seed. Flowers entered Week 18 as Baltimore's leader in receptions (73) and receiving yards (1,047), and he became the first wide receiver in franchise history to earn a Pro Bowl selection at the position. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

                "content": "Barcelona (/ˌbɑːrsəˈloʊnə/ ⓘ BAR-sə-LOH-nə; Catalan: [bəɾsəˈlonə] ⓘ; Spanish: [baɾθeˈlona] ⓘ) is a city on the northeastern coast of Spain. It is the capital and largest city of the autonomous community of Catalonia, as well as the second-most populous municipality of Spain. With a population of 1.6 million within city limits,[8] its urban area extends to numerous neighbouring municipalities within the province of Barcelona and is home to around 5.3 million people,[3] making it the fifth most populous urban area of the European Union after Paris, the Ruhr area, Madrid and Milan.[3] It is one of the largest metropolises on the Mediterranean Sea, located on the coast between the mouths of the rivers Llobregat and Besòs, bounded to the west by the Serra de Collserola mountain range. According to tradition, Barcelona was founded by either the Phoenicians or the Carthaginians, who had trading posts along the Catalonian coast.[9] In the Middle Ages, Barcelona became the capital of the County of Barcelona. After joining with the Kingdom of Aragon to form the confederation of the Crown of Aragon, Barcelona, which continued to be the capital of the Principality of Catalonia, became the most important city in the Crown of Aragon and the main economic and administrative centre of the Crown, only to be overtaken by Valencia, wrested from Moorish control by the Catalans, shortly before the dynastic union between the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon in 1492. Barcelona became the centre of Catalan separatism, briefly becoming part of France during the 17th century Reapers' War and again in 1812 until 1814 under Napoleon. It was the capital of Revolutionary Catalonia during the Spanish Revolution of 1936, and the seat of government of the Second Spanish Republic later in the Spanish Civil War, until its capture by the fascists in 1939. After the Spanish transition to democracy in the 1970s, Barcelona once again became the capital of an autonomous Catalonia. Barcelona has a rich cultural heritage and is today an important cultural centre and a major tourist destination. Particularly renowned are the architectural works of Antoni Gaudí and Lluís Domènech i Montaner, which have been designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The city is home to two of the most prestigious universities in Spain: the University of Barcelona and Pompeu Fabra University. The headquarters of the Union for the Mediterranean are located in Barcelona. The city is known for hosting the 1992 Summer Olympics as well as world-class conferences and expositions. In addition, many international sport tournaments have been played here. Barcelona is a major cultural, economic, and financial centre in southwestern Europe,[10] as well as the main biotech hub in Spain.[11] As a leading world city, Barcelona's influence in global socio-economic affairs qualifies it for global city status (Beta +).[12] Barcelona is a transport hub, with the Port of Barcelona being one of Europe's principal seaports and busiest European passenger port,[13] an international airport, Barcelona–El Prat Airport, which handles over 50-million passengers per year,[14] an extensive motorway network, and a high-speed rail line with a link to France and the rest of Europe.[15] The name Barcelona comes from the ancient Iberian Baŕkeno, attested in an ancient coin inscription found on the right side of the coin in Iberian script as ,[16] in Ancient Greek sources as Βαρκινών, Barkinṓn;[17][18] and in Latin as Barcino,[19] Barcilonum[20] and Barcenona.[21][22][23] Other sources suggest that the city may have been named after the Carthaginian general Hamilcar Barca, who was supposed to have founded the city in the 3rd century BC,[9][24] but there is no evidence its name in antiquity, Barcino, was connected with the Barcid family of Hamilcar.[25] During the Middle Ages, the city was variously known as Barchinona, Barçalona, Barchelonaa, and Barchenona. An abbreviated form sometimes used by locals for the city is Barna. Barça is only applied to the local football club FC Barcelona, not to the city. Another common abbreviation is 'BCN', which is also the IATA airport code of the Barcelona-El Prat Airport. The city is referred to as the Ciutat Comtal in Catalan and Ciudad Condal in Spanish (i.e., \"Comital City\" or \"City of Counts\"), owing to its past as the seat of the Count of Barcelona.[26] The origin of the earliest settlement at the site of present-day Barcelona is unclear. The ruins of an early settlement have been found, including different tombs and dwellings dating to earlier than 5000 BC.[27][28] In Greek mythology, the founding of Barcelona had been attributed to the mythological Hercules. According to tradition, Barcelona was founded by Punic (Phoenician) settlers, who had trading posts along the Catalonian coast.[9][29][30] In particular, some historians attribute the foundation of the city directly to the historical Carthaginian general, Hamilcar Barca, father of Hannibal, who supposedly named the city Barcino after his family in the 3rd century BC,[9][31] but this theory has been questioned.[25] Archeological evidence in the form of coins from the 3rd century BC have been found on the hills at the foot of Montjuïc with the name Bárkeno written in an ancient script in the Iberian language[citation needed]. Thus, we can conclude[clarification needed] that the Laietani[citation needed], an ancient Iberian (pre-Roman) people of the Iberian peninsula, who inhabited the area occupied by the city of Barcelona around 3–2 BC[clarification needed], called the area Bàrkeno, which means \"The Place of the Plains\" (Barrke = plains/terrace).[32][better source needed] In about 15 BC, the Romans redrew the town as a castrum (Roman military camp) centred on the \"Mons Taber\", a little hill near the Generalitat (Catalan Government) and city hall buildings. The Roman Forum, at the crossing of the Cardo Maximus and Decumanus Maximus, was approximately placed where current Plaça de Sant Jaume is. Thus, the political centre of the city, Catalonia, and its domains has remained in the same place for over 2,000 years. Under the Romans, it was a colony with the surname of Faventia,[33] or, in full, Colonia Faventia Julia Augusta Pia Barcino[34] or Colonia Julia Augusta Faventia Paterna Barcino. Pomponius Mela[35] mentions it among the small towns of the district, probably as it was eclipsed by its neighbour Tarraco (modern Tarragona), but it may be gathered from later writers that it gradually grew in wealth and consequence, favoured as it was with a beautiful situation and an excellent harbour.[36] It enjoyed immunity from imperial burdens.[37] The city minted its own coins; some from the era of Galba survive. Important Roman vestiges are displayed in Plaça del Rei underground, as a part of the Barcelona City History Museum (MUHBA); the typically Roman grid plan is still visible today in the layout of the historical centre, the Barri Gòtic (Gothic Quarter). Some remaining fragments of the Roman walls have been incorporated into the cathedral.[38] The cathedral, Catedral Basílica Metropolitana de Barcelona, is also sometimes called La Seu, which simply means cathedral (and see, among other things) in Catalan.[39][40] It is said to have been founded in 343. The city was conquered by the Visigoths in the early 5th century, becoming for a few years the capital of all Hispania. After being conquered by the Umayyads in the early 8th century, it was conquered after a siege in 801 by Charlemagne's son Louis, who made Barcelona the seat of the Carolingian \"Hispanic March\" (Marca Hispanica), a buffer zone ruled by the Count of Barcelona.[41] The Counts of Barcelona became increasingly independent and expanded their territory to include much of modern Catalonia, although in 985, Barcelona was sacked by the army of Almanzor.[42] The sack was so traumatic that most of Barcelona's population was either killed or enslaved.[43] In 1137, Aragon and the County of Barcelona merged in dynastic union[44][45] by the marriage of Ramon Berenguer IV and Petronilla of Aragon, their titles finally borne by only one person when their son Alfonso II of Aragon ascended to the throne in 1162. His territories were later to be known as the Crown of Aragon, which conquered many overseas possessions and ruled the western Mediterranean Sea with outlying territories in Naples and Sicily and as far as Athens in the 13th century. Barcelona was the leading slave trade centre of the Crown of Aragon up until the 15th century, when it was eclipsed by Valencia.[46] It initially fed from eastern and Balkan slave stock later drawing from a Maghribian and, ultimately, Subsaharan pool of slaves.[47] The Bank or Taula de canvi de Barcelona, often viewed as the oldest public bank in Europe, was established by the city magistrates in 1401. It originated from necessities of the state, as did the Bank of Venice (1402) and the Bank of Genoa (1407).[48] In the beginning of the Early Modern period, Barcelona lost political primacy, but the economy managed to achieve a balance between production capacity and imports.[49] In the context of the wider early recovery of Catalonia from the 17th-century crisis in the second half of the century, increasing maritime activity since 1675 doubled traffic in the port of Barcelona compared to figures from the beginning of the 17th century.[50] In the late 17th and early 18th century, Barcelona repeatedly endured the effects of war, including the 1691 bombing, the sieges of 1697, 1704, 1705, 1706, and the 1713 blockade and ensuing 1714 siege and assault.[51] In the 18th century, the population grew from 30,000 to about 100,000 inhabitants, as the city became one of the key mercantile centres in the Western Mediterranean, with inland influence up to Zaragoza, and to the south up to Alicante.[52] A fortress was built at Montjuïc that overlooked the harbour. Much of Barcelona was negatively affected by the Napoleonic wars, but the start of industrialization saw the fortunes of the province improve. In the mid-1850s, Barcelona was struggling with population density as it became an industrial, port city and European capital. The city's density was at 856 people per hectare, more than double that of Paris. Mortality rates were on the rise and any outbreaks of disease would devastate the population. To solve the issue, a civil engineer named Ildefons Cerdà proposed a plan for a new district known as the Eixample. The citizens of Barcelona had begun to demolish the medieval wall surrounding and constricting the city. Cerdà thought it best to transform the land outside the walls into an area characterized by a scientific approach to urbanization. His proposal consisted of a grid of streets to unite the old city and surrounding villages. There would also be wide streets to allow people to breathe clean air, gardens in the centre of each street block, integration of rich and poor giving both groups access to the same services, and smooth-flowing traffic. Urban quality, egalitarianism, hygiene, sunlight, and efficiency were all major keys for Cerdà's vision. Not everything he imagined would be realized within the Eixample district, but the iconic octagonal superblocks with chamfered corners for better visibility are his direct brainchild and remain immensely helpful even 170 years later. The district and its ideals were not appreciated at the time. The city council awarded the design of the extension plan to another architect. The Spanish government was the one to step in and impose Cerdà's plan, laying the groundwork for many more tensions between the Spanish and Catalan administrations. Regardless, some of the upper class citizens of Barcelona were excited by the new plan and began a race to build \"the biggest, tallest, most attractive house\" in the district. Their interest and money fueled the rich diversity that we now see in the district's architecture. In the end, Cerdà's ideas would have a lasting impact on Barcelona's development, earning it international recognition for its highly efficient approach to urban planning and design.[53][54] During the Spanish Civil War, the city, and Catalonia in general, were resolutely Republican. Many enterprises and public services were collectivized by the CNT and UGT unions. As the power of the Republican government and the Generalitat diminished, much of the city was under the effective control of anarchist groups. The anarchists lost control of the city to their own allies, the Communists and official government troops, after the street fighting of the Barcelona May Days. The fall of the city on 26 January 1939, caused a mass exodus of civilians who fled to the French border. The resistance of Barcelona to Franco's coup d'état was to have lasting effects after the defeat of the Republican government. The autonomous institutions of Catalonia were abolished,[57] and the use of the Catalan language in public life was suppressed. Barcelona remained the second largest city in Spain, at the heart of a region which was relatively industrialized and prosperous, despite the devastation of the civil war. The result was a large-scale immigration from poorer regions of Spain (particularly Andalusia, Murcia and Galicia), which in turn led to rapid urbanization. In 1992, Barcelona hosted the Summer Olympics. The after-effects of this are credited with driving major changes in what had, up until then, been a largely industrial city. As part of the preparation for the games, industrial buildings along the sea-front were demolished and 3 km (2 mi) of beach were created. New construction increased the road capacity of the city by 17%, the sewage handling capacity by 27% and the amount of new green areas and beaches by 78%. Between 1990 and 2004, the number of hotel rooms in the city doubled. Perhaps more importantly, the outside perception of the city was changed making, by 2012, Barcelona the 12th most popular city destination in the world and the 5th amongst European cities.[58][59][60][61][62] The death of Franco in 1975 brought on a period of democratization throughout Spain. Pressure for change was particularly strong in Barcelona, which considered that it had been punished during nearly forty years of Francoism for its support of the Republican government.[63] Massive, but peaceful, demonstrations on 11 September 1977 assembled over a million people in the streets of Barcelona to call for the restoration of Catalan autonomy. It was granted less than a month later.[64] The development of Barcelona was promoted by two events in 1986: Spanish accession to the European Community, and particularly Barcelona's designation as host city of the 1992 Summer Olympics.[65][66] The process of urban regeneration has been rapid, and accompanied by a greatly increased international reputation of the city as a tourist destination. The increased cost of housing has led to a slight decline (−16.6%) in the population over the last two decades of the 20th century as many families move out into the suburbs. This decline has been reversed since 2001, as a new wave of immigration (particularly from Latin America and from Morocco) has gathered pace.[67] In 1987, an ETA car bombing at Hipercor killed 21 people. On 17 August 2017, a van was driven into pedestrians on La Rambla, killing 14 and injuring at least 100, one of whom later died. Other attacks took place elsewhere in Catalonia. The Prime Minister of Spain, Mariano Rajoy, called the attack in Barcelona a jihadist attack. Amaq News Agency attributed indirect responsibility for the attack to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).[68][69][70] During the 2010s, Barcelona became the focus city[citation needed] for the ongoing Catalan independence movement, its consequent standoff between the regional and national government and later protests.[71] In July 2023, Barcelona was announced as the UNESCO-UIA World Capital of Architecture for the 2024–2026 term. This means it will be the hub for discussion around global challenges including culture, heritage, urban planning and architecture. In addition to being the capital through 2026, it will also host the UIA World Congress of Architects for that year. The honour is befitting of Barcelona, as its history is peppered with architectural achievement and various iconic styles and influences. From its ancient Roman roots, to the Gothic and Modernisme movements, Barcelona has thrived through the way it ties together architecture and culture.[72] Barcelona is located on the northeast coast of the Iberian Peninsula, facing the Mediterranean Sea, on a plain approximately 5 km (3 mi) wide limited by the mountain range of Collserola, the Llobregat river to the southwest and the Besòs river to the north.[73] This plain covers an area of 170 km2 (66 sq mi),[73] of which 101 km2 (39.0 sq mi)[74] are occupied by the city itself. It is 120 km (75 mi) south of the Pyrenees and the Catalan border with France. Tibidabo, 512 m (1,680 ft) high, offers striking views over the city[75] and is topped by the 288.4 m (946.2 ft) Torre de Collserola, a telecommunications tower that is visible from most of the city. Barcelona is peppered with small hills, most of them urbanized, that gave their name to the neighbourhoods built upon them, such as Carmel (267 m or 876 ft), Putxet (es) (181 m or 594 ft) and Rovira (261 m or 856 ft). The escarpment of Montjuïc (173 m or 568 ft), situated to the southeast, overlooks the harbour and is topped by Montjuïc Castle, a fortress built in the 17–18th centuries to control the city as a replacement for the Ciutadella. Today, the fortress is a museum and Montjuïc is home to several sporting and cultural venues, as well as Barcelona's biggest park and gardens. The city borders on the municipalities of Santa Coloma de Gramenet and Sant Adrià de Besòs to the north; the Mediterranean Sea to the east; El Prat de Llobregat and L'Hospitalet de Llobregat to the south; and Sant Feliu de Llobregat, Sant Just Desvern, Esplugues de Llobregat, Sant Cugat del Vallès, and Montcada i Reixac to the west. The municipality includes two small sparsely-inhabited exclaves to the north-west. According to the Köppen climate classification, Barcelona has a hot summer Mediterranean climate (Csa), with mild winters and warm to hot summers,[76] while the rainiest seasons are autumn and spring. The rainfall pattern is characterized by a short (3 months) dry season in summer, as well as less winter rainfall than in a typical Mediterranean climate. However, both June and August are wetter than February, which is unusual for the Mediterranean climate. This subtype, labelled as \"Portuguese\" by the French geographer George Viers after the climate classification of Emmanuel de Martonne[77] and found in the NW Mediterranean area (e.g. Marseille), can be seen as transitional to the humid subtropical climate (Cfa) found in inland areas. Barcelona is densely populated, thus heavily influenced by the urban heat island effect. Areas outside of the urbanized districts can have as much as 2 °C of difference in temperatures throughout the year.[78] Its average annual temperature is 21.2 °C (70.2 °F) during the day and 15.1 °C (59.2 °F) at night. The average annual temperature of the sea is about 20 °C (68 °F). In the coldest month, January, the temperature typically ranges from 12 to 18 °C (54 to 64 °F) during the day, 6 to 12 °C (43 to 54 °F) at night and the average sea temperature is 13 °C (55 °F).[79] In the warmest month, August, the typical temperature ranges from 27 to 31 °C (81 to 88 °F) during the day, about 23 °C (73 °F) at night and the average sea temperature is 26 °C (79 °F).[79] Generally, the summer or \"holiday\" season lasts about six months, from May to October. Two months – April and November – are transitional; sometimes the temperature exceeds 20 °C (68 °F), with an average temperature of 18–19 °C (64–66 °F) during the day and 11–13 °C (52–55 °F) at night. December, January and February are the coldest months, with average temperatures around 15 °C (59 °F) during the day and 9 °C (48 °F) at night. Large fluctuations in temperature are rare, particularly in the summer months. Because of the proximity to the warm sea plus the urban heat island, frosts are very rare in the city of Barcelona. Snow is also very infrequent in the city of Barcelona, but light snowfalls can occur yearly in the nearby Collserola mountains, such as in the Fabra Observatory located in a nearby mountain.[80] Barcelona averages 78 rainy days per year (≥ 1 mm), and annual average relative humidity is 72%, ranging from 69% in July to 75% in October. Rainfall totals are highest in late summer and autumn (September–November) and lowest in early and mid-summer (June–August), with a secondary winter minimum (February–March). Sunshine duration is 2,524 hours per year, from 138 (average 4.5 hours of sunshine a day) in December to 310 (average 10 hours of sunshine a day) in July.[81] According to Barcelona's City Council, the city's population as of 1 January 2016[update] was 1,608,746 people,[86] on a land area of 101.4 km2 (39 sq mi). It is the main component of an administrative area of Greater Barcelona, with a population of 3,218,071 in an area of 636 km2 (246 sq mi) (density 5,060 inhabitants/km2). The population of the urban area was 4,840,000.[3] It is the central nucleus of the Barcelona metropolitan area, which relies on a population of 5,474,482.[4] In 1900, Barcelona had a population of 533,000,[73] which grew steadily but slowly until 1950, when it started absorbing a high number of people from other less-industrialized parts of Spain. Barcelona's population peaked in 1979 at 1,906,998, and fell throughout the 1980s and 1990s as more people sought a higher quality of life in outlying cities in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area. After bottoming out in 2000 with 1,496,266 residents, the city's population began to rise again as younger people started to return, causing a great increase in housing prices.[87] Spanish is the most spoken language in Barcelona (according to the linguistic census held by the Government of Catalonia in 2013) and it is understood almost universally. Catalan is also very commonly spoken in the city: it is understood by 95% of the population, while 72.3% can speak it, 79% can read it, and 53% can write it.[88] Knowledge of Catalan has increased significantly in recent decades thanks to a language immersion educational system. After Catalan and Spanish, the most spoken languages in Barcelona are those from North Africa, such as Amazigh and Arabic, followed by Bengali, Urdu, Panjabi, Mandarin Chinese, Romanian, English, Russian and Quechua, according to data collected by the University of Barcelona.[89] Barcelona is one of the most densely populated cities in Europe. For the year 2008 the city council calculated the population to 1,621,090 living in the 102.2 km2 sized municipality, giving the city an average population density of 15,926 inhabitants per square kilometre with Eixample being the most populated district.[90][full citation needed] In the case of Barcelona though, the land distribution is extremely uneven. Half of the municipality or 50.2 km2, all of it located on the municipal edge is made up of the ten least densely populated neighbourhoods containing less than 10% of the city's population, the uninhabited Zona Franca industrial area and Montjuïc forest park. Leaving the remaining 90% or slightly below 1.5 million inhabitants living on the remaining 52 km2 (20 sq mi) at an average density close to 28,500 inhabitants per square kilometre.[90][full citation needed] Of the 73 neighbourhoods in the city, 45 had a population density above 20,000 inhabitants per square kilometre with a combined population of 1,313,424 inhabitants living on 38.6 km2 at an average density of 33,987 inhabitants per square kilometre. The 30 most densely populated neighbourhoods accounted for 57.5% of the city population occupying only 22.7% of the municipality, or in other words, 936,406 people living at an average density of 40,322 inhabitants per square kilometre. The city's highest density is found at and around the neighbourhood of la Sagrada Família where four of the city's most densely populated neighbourhoods are located side by side, all with a population density above 50,000 inhabitants per square kilometre.[90][full citation needed] In 1900, almost a third (28.9 percent) of the population were children (aged younger than 14 years). In 2017, this age group constituted only 12.7% of the population. In 2017, people aged between 15 and 24 years made up 9 percent of the population; those aged between 25 and 44 years made up 30.6 percent of the population; while those aged between 45 and 64 years formed 56.9% of all Barcelonans. In 1900, people aged 65 and older made up just 6.5 percent of the population. In 2017, this age group made up 21.5 percent of the population.[91][92] In 2016, about 59% of the inhabitants of the city were born in Catalonia and 18.5% coming from the rest of the country. In addition to that, 22.5% of the population was born outside of Spain, a proportion which has more than doubled since 2001 and more than quintupled since 1996 when it was 8.6% and 3.9% respectively.[86] The most important region of origin of migrants is Europe, with many coming from Italy (26,676) or France (13,506).[86] Moreover, many migrants come from Latin American nations such as Bolivia, Ecuador or Colombia. Since the 1990s, and similar to other migrants, many Latin Americans have settled in northern parts of the city.[94] There exists a relatively large Pakistani community in Barcelona with up to twenty thousand nationals. The community consists of significantly more men than women. Many of the Pakistanis are living in Ciutat Vella. First Pakistani migrants came in the 1970s, with increasing numbers in the 1990s.[95] Other significant migrant groups come from Asia as from China and the Philippines.[86] There is a Japanese community clustered in Bonanova, Les Tres Torres, Pedralbes, and other northern neighbourhoods, and a Japanese international school serves that community.[96] In 2007, most of the inhabitants stated they are Roman Catholic (208 churches).[97] In a 2011 survey conducted by InfoCatólica, 49.5% of Barcelona residents of all ages identified themselves as Catholic.[98] This was the first time that more than half of respondents did not identify themselves as Catholic Christians.[98] The numbers reflect a broader trend in Spain whereby the numbers of self-identified Catholics have declined.[98] In 2019, a survey by Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas showed that 53.2% of residents in Barcelona identified themselves as Catholic (9.9% practising Catholics, 43.3% non-practising Catholics).[99] The province has the largest Muslim community in Spain, 322,698 people in Barcelona province are of Muslim religion.[100] A considerable number of Muslims live in Barcelona due to immigration (169 locations, mostly professed by Moroccans in Spain).[97] In 2014, 322,698 out of 5.5 million people in the province of Barcelona identified themselves as Muslim,[100] which makes 5.6% of the total population. The city also has the largest Jewish community in Spain, with an estimated 3,500 Jews living in the city.[101] There are also a number of other groups, including Evangelical (71 locations, mostly professed by Roma), Jehovah's Witnesses (21 Kingdom Halls), Buddhists (13 locations),[102] and Eastern Orthodox.[103] The Barcelona metropolitan area comprises over 66% of the people of Catalonia, one of the richer regions in Europe and the fourth richest region per capita in Spain, with a GDP per capita amounting to €28,400 (16% more than the EU average). The greater Barcelona metropolitan area had a GDP amounting to $177 billion (equivalent to $34,821 in per capita terms, 44% more than the EU average), making it the 4th most economically powerful city by gross GDP in the European Union, and 35th in the world in 2009.[104] Barcelona city had a very high GDP of €80,894 per head in 2004, according to Eurostat.[105] Furthermore, Barcelona was Europe's fourth best business city and fastest improving European city, with growth improved by 17% per year as of 2009[update].[106] Barcelona was the 24th most \"livable city\" in the world in 2015 according to lifestyle magazine Monocle.[107] Similarly, according to Innovation Analysts 2thinknow, Barcelona occupies 13th place in the world on Innovation Cities™ Global Index.[108] At the same time it is according to the Global Wealth and Lifestyle Report 2020 one of the most affordable cities in the world for a luxury lifestyle.[109] Barcelona has a long-standing mercantile tradition. Less well known is that the city industrialized early, taking off in 1833, when Catalonia's already sophisticated textile industry began to use steam power. It became the first and most important industrial city in the Mediterranean basin. Since then, manufacturing has played a large role in its history. Borsa de Barcelona (Barcelona Stock Exchange) is the main stock exchange in the northeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula. Barcelona was recognized as the Southern European City of the Future for 2014/15, based on its economic potential,[110] by FDi Magazine in their bi-annual rankings.[111] It also has several congress halls, notably Fira de Barcelona – the second largest trade fair and exhibition centre in Europe, that host a quickly growing number of national and international events each year (at present above 50). The total exhibition floor space of Fira de Barcelona venues is 405,000 m2 (41 ha), not counting Gran Via centre on the Plaza de Europa. However, the Eurozone crisis and deep cuts in business travel affected the council's positioning of the city as a convention centre. An important business centre, the World Trade Center Barcelona, is located in Barcelona's Port Vell harbour. The city is known for hosting well as world-class conferences and expositions, including the 1888 Exposición Universal de Barcelona, the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition (Expo 1929), the 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures and the 2004 World Urban Forum.[112] Barcelona was the 20th-most-visited city in the world by international visitors and the fifth most visited city in Europe after London, Paris, Istanbul and Rome, with 5.5 million international visitors in 2011.[113] By 2015, both Prague and Milan had more international visitors.[114] With its popular tree-lined pedestrian street, Les Rambles (Las Ramblas), Barcelona is ranked the most popular city to visit in Spain.[115] Barcelona is an internationally renowned tourist destination, with numerous recreational areas, one of the best beaches in the world,[116][117] mild and warm climate, historical monuments, including eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites, 519 hotels as of March 2016[update][118] including 35 five-star hotels,[119] and developed tourist infrastructure. Due to its large influx of tourists each year, Barcelona, like many other tourism capitals, has to deal with pickpockets, with wallets and passports being commonly stolen items. Despite its moderate pickpocket rate, Barcelona is considered one of the safest cities in terms of security and personal safety,[120] mainly because of a sophisticated policing strategy that has dropped crime by 32% in just over three years and has led it to be considered the 15th safest city in the world by Business Insider in 2016.[121] While tourism produces economic benefits, according to one report,[citation needed] the city is \"overrun [by] hordes of tourists\". In early 2017, over 150,000 protesters warned that tourism is destabilizing the city. Slogans included \"Tourists go home\", \"Barcelona is not for sale\" and \"We will not be driven out\". By then, the number of visitors had increased from 1.7 million in 1990 to 32 million in a city with a population of 1.62 million, increasing the cost of rental housing for residents and overcrowding the public places. While tourists spent an estimated €30 billion in 2017, they are viewed by some as a threat to Barcelona's identity.[122] A May 2017 article in the British online daily The Independent included Barcelona among the \"Eight Places That Hate Tourists the Most\" and included a comment from Mayor Ada Colau, \"We don't want the city to become a cheap souvenir shop\", citing Venice as an example.[123] To moderate the problem, the city has stopped issuing licenses for new hotels and holiday apartments; it also fined AirBnb €30,000. The mayor has suggested introducing a new tourist tax and setting a limit on the number of visitors.[123] One industry insider, Justin Francis, founder of the Responsible Travel agency, stated that steps must be taken to limit the number of visitors that are causing an \"overtourism crisis\" in several major European cities. \"Ultimately, residents must be prioritised over tourists for housing, infrastructure and access to services because they have a long-term stake in the city's success\", he said.[124] \"Managing tourism more responsibly can help\", Francis later told a journalist, \"but some destinations may just have too many tourists, and Barcelona may be a case of that\".[125] Industry generates 21% of the total gross domestic product (GDP) of the region,[126] with the energy, chemical and metallurgy industries accounting for 47% of industrial production.[127] The Barcelona metropolitan area had 67% of the total number of industrial establishments in Catalonia as of 1997.[128] Barcelona has long been an important European automobile manufacturing centre. Formerly there were automobile factories of AFA, Abadal, Actividades Industriales, Alvarez, America, Artés de Arcos, Balandrás, Baradat-Esteve, Biscúter, J.

There is also a Nissan factory in the logistics and industrial area of the city.[131] The factory of Derbi, a large manufacturer of motorcycles, scooters and mopeds, also lies near the city.[132] As in other modern cities, the manufacturing sector has long since been overtaken by the services sector, though it remains very important. The region's leading industries are textiles, chemical, pharmaceutical, motor, electronic, printing, logistics, publishing, in telecommunications industry and culture the notable Mobile World Congress, and information technology services. The traditional importance of textiles is reflected in Barcelona's drive to become a major fashion centre. There have been many attempts to launch Barcelona as a fashion capital, notably Gaudi Home.[citation needed] Beginning in the summer of 2000, the city hosted the Bread & Butter urban fashion fair until 2009, when its organizers announced that it would be returning to Berlin. This was a hard blow for the city as the fair brought €100 m to the city in just three days.[133][134] From 2009, The Brandery, an urban fashion show, was held in Barcelona twice a year until 2012. According to the Global Language Monitor's annual ranking of the world's top fifty fashion capitals Barcelona was named as the seventh most important fashion capital of the world right after Milan and before Berlin in 2015.[135] As the capital of the autonomous community of Catalonia, Barcelona is the seat of the Catalan government, known as the Generalitat de Catalunya; of particular note are the executive branch, the parliament, and the High Court of Justice of Catalonia. The city is also the capital of the Province of Barcelona and the Barcelonès comarca (district). Barcelona is governed by a city council formed by 41 city councillors, elected for a four-year term by universal suffrage. As one of the two biggest cities in Spain, Barcelona is subject to a special law articulated through the Carta Municipal (Municipal Law). A first version of this law was passed in 1960 and amended later, but the current version was approved in March 2006.[136] According to this law, Barcelona's city council is organized in two levels: a political one, with elected city councillors, and one executive, which administers the programs and executes the decisions taken on the political level.[137] This law also gives the local government a special relationship with the central government and it also gives the mayor wider prerogatives by the means of municipal executive commissions.[138] It expands the powers of the city council in areas like telecommunications, city traffic, road safety and public safety. It also gives a special economic regime to the city's treasury and it gives the council a veto in matters that will be decided by the central government, but that will need a favourable report from the council.[136] The Comissió de Govern (Government Commission) is the executive branch, formed by 24 councillors, led by the Mayor, with 5 lieutenant-mayors and 17 city councillors, each in charge of an area of government, and 5 non-elected councillors.[139] The plenary, formed by the 41 city councillors, has advisory, planning, regulatory, and fiscal executive functions.[140] The six Commissions del Consell Municipal (City council commissions) have executive and controlling functions in the field of their jurisdiction. They are composed by a number of councillors proportional to the number of councillors each political party has in the plenary.[141] The city council has jurisdiction in the fields of city planning, transportation, municipal taxes, public highways security through the Guàrdia Urbana (the municipal police), city maintenance, gardens, parks and environment, facilities (like schools, nurseries, sports centres, libraries, and so on), culture, sports, youth and social welfare. Some of these competencies are not exclusive, but shared with the Generalitat de Catalunya or the central Spanish government. In some fields with shared responsibility (such as public health, education or social services), there is a shared Agency or Consortium between the city and the Generalitat to plan and manage services.[142] The executive branch is led by a Chief Municipal Executive Officer which answers to the Mayor. It is made up of departments which are legally part of the city council and by separate legal entities of two types: autonomous public departments and public enterprises.[143] The seat of the city council is on the Plaça de Sant Jaume, opposite the seat of Generalitat de Catalunya. Since the coming of the Spanish democracy, Barcelona had been governed by the PSC, first with an absolute majority and later in coalition with ERC and ICV. After the May 2007 election, the ERC did not renew the coalition agreement and the PSC governed in a minority coalition with ICV as the junior partner. After 32 years, on 22 May 2011, CiU gained a plurality of seats at the municipal election, gaining 15 seats to the PSC's 11. The PP hold 8 seats, ICV 5 and ERC 2. Since 1987, the city has been divided into 10 administrative districts (districtes in Catalan, distritos in Spanish): The districts are based mostly on historical divisions, and several are former towns annexed by the city of Barcelona in the 18th and 19th centuries that still maintain their own distinct character. Each district has its own council led by a city councillor. The composition of each district council depends on the number of votes each political party had in that district, so a district can be led by a councillor from a different party than the executive council. Barcelona has a well-developed higher education system of public universities. Most prominent among these are the University of Barcelona (established in 1450) and the more modern Pompeu Fabra University.[144][145] Barcelona is also home to the Polytechnic University of Catalonia, and in the private sector the EADA Business School (founded in 1957), which became the first Barcelona institution to run manager training programmes for the business community. IESE Business School, as well as the largest private educational institution, the Ramon Llull University, which encompasses schools and institutes such as the ESADE Business School. The Autonomous University of Barcelona, another public university, is located in Bellaterra, a town in the Metropolitan Area. Toulouse Business School and the Open University of Catalonia (a private Internet-centred open university) are also based in Barcelona. The city has a network of public schools, from nurseries to high schools, under the responsibility of a consortium led by city council (though the curriculum is the responsibility of the Generalitat de Catalunya). There are also many private schools, some of them Roman Catholic. Most such schools receive a public subsidy on a per-student basis, are subject to inspection by the public authorities, and are required to follow the same curricular guidelines as public schools, though they charge tuition. Known as escoles concertades, they are distinct from schools whose funding is entirely private (escoles privades). The language of instruction at public schools and escoles concertades is Catalan, as stipulated by the 2009 Catalan Education Act. Spanish may be used as a language of instruction by teachers of Spanish literature or language, and foreign languages by teachers of those languages. An experimental partial immersion programme adopted by some schools allows for the teaching of a foreign language (English, generally) across the curriculum, though this is limited to a maximum of 30% of the school day. No public school or escola concertada in Barcelona may offer 50% or full immersion programmes in a foreign language, nor does any public school or escola concertada offer International Baccalaureate programmes. Barcelona's cultural roots go back 2000 years. Since the arrival of democracy, the Catalan language (very much repressed during the dictatorship of Franco) has been promoted, both by recovering works from the past and by stimulating the creation of new works. Barcelona is designated as a world-class city by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network.[146] It has also been part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a City of Literature since 2015.[147] Barcelona has many venues for live music and theatre, including the world-renowned Gran Teatre del Liceu opera house, the Teatre Nacional de Catalunya, the Teatre Lliure and the Palau de la Música Catalana concert hall. Barcelona also is home to the Barcelona Symphony and Catalonia National Orchestra (Orquestra Simfònica de Barcelona i Nacional de Catalunya, usually known as OBC), the largest symphonic orchestra in Catalonia. In 1999, the OBC inaugurated its new venue in the brand-new Auditorium (L'Auditori). It performs around 75 concerts per season and its current director is Eiji Oue.[148] It is home to the Barcelona Guitar Orchestra, directed by Sergi Vicente. The major thoroughfare of La Rambla is home to mime artists and street performers. Yearly, two major pop music festivals take place in the city, the Sónar Festival and the Primavera Sound Festival. The city also has a thriving alternative music scene, with groups such as The Pinker Tones receiving international attention.[149] Barcelona is an international hub of highly active and diverse nightlife with bars, dance bars and nightclubs staying open well past midnight.[150] El Periódico de Catalunya, La Vanguardia and Ara are Barcelona's three major daily newspapers (the first two with Catalan and Spanish editions, Ara only in Catalan) while Sport and El Mundo Deportivo (both in Spanish) are the city's two major sports daily newspapers, published by the same companies. The city is also served by a number of smaller publications such as Ara and El Punt Avui (in Catalan), by nationwide newspapers with special Barcelona editions such as El País (in Spanish, with an online version in Catalan) and El Mundo (in Spanish), and by several free newspapers like 20 minutos and Què (all bilingual). Barcelona's oldest and main online newspaper VilaWeb is also the oldest one in Europe[citation needed] (with Catalan and English editions). Several major FM stations include Catalunya Ràdio, RAC 1, RAC 105 and Cadena SER. Barcelona also has a local TV station, Betevé, owned by city council. The headquarters of Televisió de Catalunya, Catalonia's public network, are located in Sant Joan Despí, in Barcelona's metropolitan area. Barcelona has a long sporting tradition and hosted the highly successful 1992 Summer Olympics as well as several matches during the 1982 FIFA World Cup (at the two stadiums). It has hosted about 30 sports events of international significance.[citation needed] FC Barcelona is a sports club best known worldwide for its football team, one of the largest and the wealthiest in the world.[151] It has 74 national trophies (while finishing 46 times as runners-up) and 17 continental prizes (with being runners-up 11 times), including five UEFA Champions League trophies out of eight finals and three FIFA Club World Cup wins out of four finals. The club won six trophies in a calendar year in 2009, becoming one of only 2 male football teams in the world to win the coveted sextuple, apart from FC Bayern Munich in 2020. FC Barcelona also has professional teams in other sports like FC Barcelona Regal (basketball), FC Barcelona Handbol (handball), FC Barcelona Hoquei (roller hockey), FC Barcelona Ice Hockey (ice hockey), FC Barcelona Futsal (futsal) and FC Barcelona Rugby (rugby union), all at one point winners of the highest national or European competitions. The club's museum is the second most visited in Catalonia. The matches against cross-town rivals RCD Espanyol are of particular interest, but there are other Barcelonan football clubs in lower categories, like CE Europa and UE Sant Andreu. FC Barcelona's basketball team has a noted rivalry in the Liga ACB with nearby Joventut Badalona. Barcelona has three UEFA elite stadiums: FC Barcelona's Camp Nou, the largest stadium in Europe with a capacity of 99,354; the publicly owned Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys, with a capacity of 55,926; used for the 1992 Olympics; and Estadi Cornellà-El Prat, with a capacity of 40,500. Furthermore, the city has several smaller stadiums such as Mini Estadi (also owned by FC Barcelona) with a capacity of 15,000, Camp Municipal Narcís Sala with a capacity of 6,563 and Nou Sardenya with a capacity of 7,000. The city has a further three multifunctional venues for sports and concerts: the Palau Sant Jordi with a capacity of 12,000 to 24,000 (depending on use), the Palau Blaugrana with a capacity of 7,500, and the Palau dels Esports de Barcelona with a capacity of 3,500. Barcelona was the host city for the 2013 World Aquatics Championships, which were held at the Palau San Jordi.[152] Several road running competitions are organized year-round in Barcelona: the Barcelona Marathon every March with over 10,000 participants in 2010, the Cursa de Bombers in April, the Cursa de El Corte Inglés in May (with about 60,000 participants each year), the Cursa de la Mercè, the Cursa Jean Bouin, the Milla Sagrada Família and the San Silvestre. There is also the Ultratrail Collserola which passes 85 km (53 mi) through the Collserola forest. The Open Seat Godó, a 50-year-old ATP World Tour 500 Series tennis tournament, is held annually in the facilities of the Real Club de Tenis Barcelona. Each year on Christmas Day, a 200-meter swimming race across the Old Port of Barcelona takes place.[153] Near Barcelona, in Montmeló, the 107,000 capacity Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya racetrack hosts the Formula One Spanish Grand Prix, the Catalan motorcycle Grand Prix, the Spanish GT Championship and races in the GP2 Series. Skateboarding and cycling are also very popular in Barcelona; in and around the city there are dozens of kilometers of bicycle paths.[citation needed] Barcelona is also home to numerous social centres and illegal squats that effectively form a shadow society mainly made up of the unemployed, immigrants, dropouts, anarchists, anti-authoritarians and autonomists.[154] Peter Gelderloos estimates that there around 200 squatted buildings and 40 social centres across the city with thousands of inhabitants, making it one of the largest squatter movements in the world. He notes that they pirate electricity, internet and water allowing them to live on less than one euro a day. He argues that these squats embrace an anarcho-communist and anti-work philosophy, often freely fixing up new houses, cleaning, patching roofs, installing windows, toilets, showers, lights and kitchens. In the wake of austerity, the squats have provided a number of social services to the surrounding residents, including bicycle repair workshops, carpentry workshops, self-defense classes, free libraries, community gardens, free meals, computer labs, language classes, theatre groups, free medical care and legal support services.[155] The squats help elderly residents avoid eviction and organize various protests throughout Barcelona. Notable squats include Can Vies and Can Masdeu.[citation needed] Barcelona is served by Barcelona-El Prat Airport, about 17 km (11 mi) south-west of the centre of Barcelona. It is the second-largest airport in Spain, and the largest on the Mediterranean coast, which handled more than 50.17 million passengers in 2018, showing an annual upward trend.[156] It is a main hub for Vueling Airlines and Ryanair, and also a focus for Iberia and Air Europa. The airport mainly serves domestic and European destinations, although some airlines offer destinations in Latin America, Asia and the United States. The airport is connected to the city by highway, metro (Airport T1 and Airport T2 stations), commuter train (Barcelona Airport railway station) and scheduled bus service. A new terminal (T1) has been built, and entered service on 17 June 2009. Some low-cost airlines, also use Girona-Costa Brava Airport, about 90 km (56 mi) to the north, Reus Airport, 77 km (48 mi) to the south, or Lleida-Alguaire Airport, about 150 km (93 mi) to the west, of the city. Sabadell Airport is a smaller airport in the nearby town of Sabadell, devoted to pilot training, aerotaxi and private flights. The Port of Barcelona has a 2000-year-old history and a great contemporary commercial importance. It is Europe's ninth largest container port, with a trade volume of 1.72 million TEU's in 2013.[157] The port is managed by the Port Authority of Barcelona. Its 10 km2 (4 sq mi) are divided into three zones: Port Vell (the old port), the commercial port and the logistics port (Barcelona Free Port). The port is undergoing an enlargement that will double its size thanks to diverting the mouth of the Llobregat river 2 km (1 mi) to the south.[158] The Barcelona harbour is the leading European cruiser port and a very important Mediterranean turnaround base.[159] In 2013, 3.6 million pleasure cruise passengers used the Port of Barcelona.[157] The Port Vell area also houses the Maremagnum (a commercial mall), a multiplex cinema, the IMAX Port Vell and one of Europe's largest aquariums – Aquarium Barcelona, containing 8,000 fish and 11 sharks contained in 22 basins filled with 4 million litres of sea water. The Maremagnum, being situated within the confines of the port, is the only commercial mall in the city that can open on Sundays and public holidays. Barcelona is a major hub for the Spanish rail network. The city's main Inter-city rail station is Barcelona Sants railway station, whilst Estació de França terminus serves a secondary role handling suburban, regional and medium distance services. Freight services operate to local industries and to the Port of Barcelona. RENFE's AVE high-speed rail system, which is designed for speeds of 310 km/h (193 mph), was extended from Madrid to Barcelona in 2008 in the form of the Madrid–Barcelona high-speed rail line. A shared RENFE-SNCF high-speed rail connecting Barcelona and France (Paris, Marseilles and Toulouse, through Perpignan–Barcelona high-speed rail line) was launched in 2013. Both these lines serve Barcelona Sants terminal station.[160][161] Barcelona is served by an extensive local public transport network that includes a metro system, a bus network, a regional railway system, trams, funiculars, rack railways, a Gondola lift and aerial cable cars. These networks and lines are run by a number of different operators but they are integrated into a coordinated fare system, administered by the Autoritat del Transport Metropolità (ATM). The system is divided into fare zones (1 to 6) and various Integrated Travel Cards are available.[162] The Barcelona Metro network comprises twelve lines, identified by an \"L\" followed by the line number as well as by individual colours. The Metro largely runs underground; eight Metro lines are operated on dedicated track by the Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB), whilst four lines are operated by the Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya (FGC) and some of them share tracks with RENFE commuter lines. In addition to the city Metro, several regional rail lines operated by RENFE's Rodalies de Catalunya run across the city, providing connections to outlying towns in the surrounding region. The city's two modern tram systems, Trambaix and Trambesòs, are operated by TRAMMET.[163] A heritage tram line, the Tramvia Blau, also operates between the metro Line 7 and the Funicular del Tibidabo.[164] Barcelona's metro and rail system is supplemented by several aerial cable cars, funiculars and rack railways that provide connections to mountain-top stations. FGC operates the Funicular de Tibidabo up the hill of Tibidabo and the Funicular de Vallvidrera (FGC), while TMB runs the Funicular de Montjuïc up Montjuïc. The city has two aerial cable cars: the Montjuïc Cable Car, which serves Montjuïc castle, and the Port Vell Aerial Tramway that runs via Torre Jaume I and Torre Sant Sebastià over the port. Buses in Barcelona are a major form of public transport, with extensive local, interurban and night bus networks. Most local services are operated by the TMB, although some other services are operated by a number of private companies, albeit still within the ATM fare structure. There are 21 night lines, 19 of them go through Plaça de Catalunya, where you can change to other lines. The frequency is 15/20 minutes between 22:20 and 06:00. A separate private bus line, known as Aerobús, links the airport with the city centre, with its own fare structure. The Estació del Nord (Northern Station), a former railway station which was renovated for the 1992 Olympic Games, now serves as the terminus for long-distance and regional bus services. Barcelona has a metered taxi fleet governed by the Institut Metropolità del Taxi (Metropolitan Taxi Institute), composed of more than 10,000 cars. Most of the licences are in the hands of self-employed drivers. With their black and yellow livery, Barcelona's taxis are easily spotted, and can be caught from one of many taxi ranks, hailed on street, called by telephone or via app.[165][166] On 22 March 2007,[167] Barcelona's City Council started the Bicing service, a bicycle service understood as a public transport. Once the user has their user card, they can take a bicycle from any of the more than 400 stations spread around the city and use it anywhere the urban area of the city, and then leave it at another station.[168] The service has been a success, with 50,000 subscribed users in three months.[169] Barcelona lies on three international routes, including European route E15 that follows the Mediterranean coast, European route E90 to Madrid and Lisbon, and European route E09 to Paris. It is also served by a comprehensive network of motorways and highways throughout the metropolitan area, including A-2, A-7/AP-7, C-16, C-17, C-31, C-32, C-33, C-60. The city is circled by three half ring roads or bypasses, Ronda de Dalt (B-20) (on the mountain side), Ronda del Litoral (B-10) (along the coast) and Ronda del Mig (separated into two parts: Travessera de Dalt in the north and the Gran Via de Carles III), two partially covered[170] fast highways with several exits that bypass the city. The city's main arteries include Diagonal Avenue, which crosses it diagonally, Meridiana Avenue which leads to Glòries and connects with Diagonal Avenue and Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, which crosses the city from east to west, passing through its centre. The famous boulevard of La Rambla, whilst no longer an important vehicular route, remains an important pedestrian route. The Barri Gòtic (Catalan for \"Gothic Quarter\") is the centre of the old city of Barcelona. Many of the buildings date from medieval times, some from as far back as the Roman settlement of Barcelona. Catalan modernista architecture (related to the movement known as Art Nouveau in the rest of Europe) developed between 1885 and 1950 and left an important legacy in Barcelona. Several of these buildings are World Heritage Sites. Especially remarkable is the work of architect Antoni Gaudí, which can be seen throughout the city. His best-known work is the immense but still unfinished church of the Sagrada Família, which has been under construction since 1882 and is still financed by private donations. As of 2015[update], completion is planned for 2026.[171] Barcelona was also home to Mies van der Rohe's Barcelona Pavilion. Designed in 1929 for the International Exposition for Germany, it was an iconic building that came to symbolize modern architecture as the embodiment of van der Rohe's aphorisms \"less is more\" and \"God is in the details\".[172] The Barcelona pavilion was intended as a temporary structure and was torn down in 1930 less than a year after it was constructed. A modern re-creation by Spanish architects now stands in Barcelona, however, constructed in 1986. Barcelona won the 1999 RIBA Royal Gold Medal for its architecture,[173] the first (and as of 2015[update], only) time that the winner has been a city rather than an individual architect. Barcelona is the home of many points of interest declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO:[174] Barcelona has a great number of museums, which cover different areas and eras. The National Museum of Art of Catalonia possesses a well-known collection of Romanesque art, while the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art focuses on post-1945 Catalan and Spanish art. The Fundació Joan Miró, Picasso Museum, and Fundació Antoni Tàpies hold important collections of these world-renowned artists, as well as the Can Framis Museum, focused on post-1960 Catalan Art owned by Fundació Vila Casas. Several museums cover the fields of history and archaeology, like the Barcelona City History Museum (MUHBA), the Museum of the History of Catalonia, the Archeology Museum of Catalonia, the Maritime Museum of Barcelona, the Music Museum of Barcelona and the privately owned Egyptian Museum. The Erotic museum of Barcelona is among the most peculiar ones, while CosmoCaixa is a science museum that received the European Museum of the Year Award in 2006.[175] The Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona was founded in 1882 under the name of \"Museo Martorell de Arqueología y Ciencias Naturales\"[176][177] (Spanish for \"Martorell Museum of Archaeology and Natural Sciences\"). In 2011 the Museum of Natural Sciences ended up with a merge of five institutions: the Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona (the main site, at the Forum Building), the Martorell Museum (the historical seat of the Museum, opened to the public from 1924 to 2010 as a geology museum), the Laboratori de Natura, at the Castle of the Three Dragons (from 1920 to 2010: the Zoology Museum), the Historical Botanical Garden of Barcelona, founded 1930, and the Botanical garden of Barcelona, founded 1999. Those two gardens are a part of the Botanical Institute of Barcelona too. The FC Barcelona Museum is the third most popular tourist attraction in Catalonia, with 1,51 million visitors in 2013.[178] Barcelona contains sixty municipal parks, twelve of which are historic, five of which are thematic (botanical), forty-five of which are urban, and six of which are forest.[179] They range from vest-pocket parks to large recreation areas. The urban parks alone cover 10% of the city (549.7 ha or 1,358.3 acres).[74] The total park surface grows about 10 ha (25 acres) per year,[180] with a proportion of 18.1 m2 (195 sq ft) of park area per inhabitant.[181] Of Barcelona's parks, Montjuïc is the largest, with 203 ha located on the mountain of the same name, and includes the Botanical Garden of Barcelona, the Mossèn Costa i Llobera Gardens, and more.[74] It is followed by Parc de la Ciutadella (which occupies the site of the old citadel and which houses the Parliament building, the Barcelona Zoo, and several museums); 31 ha or 76.6 acres including the zoo), the Guinardó Park (19 ha or 47.0 acres), Park Güell (designed by Antoni Gaudí; 17.2 ha or 42.5 acres), Oreneta Castle Park (also 17.2 ha or 42.5 acres), Diagonal Mar Park (13.3 ha or 32.9 acres, inaugurated in 2002), Nou Barris Central Park (13.2 ha or 32.6 acres), Can Dragó Sports Park and Poblenou Park (both 11.9 ha or 29.4 acres), the Labyrinth Park (9.10 ha or 22.5 acres), named after the garden maze it contains.[74] There are also several smaller parks, for example, the Parc de Les Aigües (2 ha or 4.9 acres). A part of the Collserola Park is also within the city limits. PortAventura World, one of the largest resort in Europe, with 5,837,509 visitors per year, is located one hour's drive from Barcelona.[182][183] Also, within the city lies Tibidabo Amusement Park, a smaller amusement park in Plaza del Tibidabo, with the Muntanya Russa amusement ride. Barcelona beach was listed as number one in a list of the top ten city beaches in the world according to National Geographic[116] and Discovery Channel.[184] Barcelona contains seven beaches, totalling 4.5 km (2+3⁄4 mi) of coastline. Sant Sebastià, Barceloneta and Somorrostro beaches, both 1,100 m (3,610 ft) in length,[74] are the largest, oldest and the most-frequented beaches in Barcelona. The Olympic Harbour separates them from the other city beaches: Nova Icària, Bogatell, Mar Bella, Nova Mar Bella and Llevant. These beaches (ranging from 400 to 640 m (1,310 to 2,100 ft) were opened as a result of the city restructuring to host the 1992 Summer Olympics, when a great number of industrial buildings were demolished. At present, the beach sand is artificially replenished given that storms regularly remove large quantities of material. The 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures left the city a large concrete bathing zone on the eastmost part of the city's coastline. Most recently, Llevant is the first beach to allow dogs access during summer season. Barcelona is twinned with:[185] Barcelona also cooperates with:[185]",

                "title": "Derrick Rose - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Derrick Martell Rose (born October 4, 1988) is an American former professional basketball player. He played one year of college basketball for the Memphis Tigers before being drafted first overall by his hometown Chicago Bulls in the 2008 NBA draft.[1] Nicknamed \"D-Rose\", and sometimes referred to as \"the Windy City Assassin\" or simply \"Pooh\",[2] he was named the NBA Rookie of the Year in 2009 and became the youngest player to win the NBA Most Valuable Player Award in 2011 at the age of 22 years and 7 months. Rose was born and raised in Chicago, and attended Simeon Career Academy. He was highly recruited by colleges, eventually choosing to join the University of Memphis under coach John Calipari. Rose led the Tigers to the most wins in NCAA history (a 38–2 record), their first number 1 ranking in 25 years, and an appearance in the NCAA championship game. In 2009, an NCAA investigation revealed that Rose's SAT scores had been invalidated, and as a result, the NCAA vacated Memphis' entire 2007–08 season.[3] Rose struggled with significant knee injuries throughout his career. In the first round of the 2012 NBA playoffs against the Philadelphia 76ers, Rose tore his ACL in his left knee. He required surgery and was subsequently sidelined for the entire 2012–13 season.[4] Rose returned to play in 2013–14, but in November 2013, he injured his right meniscus, causing him to miss the remainder of the season.[5] He returned once again the following season, but knee injuries continued to impact his availability and production. In June 2016, Rose was traded to the New York Knicks, where he finished the final year of his contract. He signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers on a minimum salary for the 2017–18 season but was hobbled by ankle injuries, which led to him being traded to, and subsequently waived by, the Utah Jazz in February 2018.[6] He signed with the Minnesota Timberwolves a month later on a rest-of-season contract; he stayed with the team through the following season and enjoyed a revived role as a sixth man off the bench despite missing 31 games due to injury management. For the 2019–20 season, the Detroit Pistons signed Rose to his first non-minimum salary contract since 2012, and he continued to be successful off the bench.[7] The following season, he was reunited with his former coach Tom Thibodeau when the Knicks re-acquired him in a trade. In July 2023, Rose signed to the Memphis Grizzlies in free agency, where he remained until September 2024, when Rose was released by the Grizzlies, and subsequently announced his own retirement. Rose was born and raised in the Englewood area, one of the most dangerous neighborhoods on Chicago's South Side.[8] He is the youngest son of Brenda Rose after Dwayne, Reggie, and Allan. All three were talented basketball players who taught Rose the ins and outs of basketball on nearby courts.[8][9] As his talent for the sport grew, Rose began to attract much more outside attention in Chicago's basketball circles, leading his mother and brothers to restrict outside contact to him. She feared he would be exploited and his path to the NBA diverted by outside parties like street agents, similar to what happened to former Chicago prospect Ronnie Fields.[10] By the time Rose enrolled at Simeon Career Academy in 2003, he was a hot commodity for collegiate coaches. Despite his reputation, he played freshmen and JV basketball for the Wolverines. He wore No. 25 in honor of Ben \"Benji\" Wilson, a promising player who was murdered by a gang member during his senior year in 1984.[11] Rose was not allowed on varsity due to a long-standing tradition that head coach Bob Hambric, who had been with the school since 1980 had no freshmen on the varsity team. That rule did not lessen Rose's play, and he went on to put up 18.5 points, 6.6 assists, 4.7 rebounds and 2.1 steals per game and led both the freshmen and sophomores to city championships with a 24–1 record.[12] Hambric softened his stance and allowed the freshman a chance to play on varsity in the state tournament, but Rose declined, wanting the players to get due credit.[13] The next year Hambric retired and Robert Smith was hired, opening the path to varsity. In Rose's debut, he had 22 points, 7 rebounds and 5 steals over Thornwood High School in a sold-out game filled with college scouts and coaches.[14] He led the Wolverines to a 30–5 mark while averaging 19.8 points, 5.1 rebounds, 8.3 assists and 2.4 steals but the season ended after a loss in state regionals. Rose's play garnered him his first national award: a Parade All-American third team spot.[15] During Rose's junior year in 2006, the Simeon Wolverines broke through and won the Chicago Public League championship held at the United Center, where Rose starred with 25 points and crowd pleasing dunks. The team advanced through the playoffs and earned a berth in the Class AA state championship against Richwoods High School, where a fourth quarter buzzer beater by Richwood forced overtime. The score was knotted at 29 late in the extra period when Rose stole the ball and buried the game winning jumper as time expired, giving Simeon its first state title since the Wilson-led Wolverines won in 1984. The team finished 33–4 and ranked nationally,[16] and Rose was awarded with an All-State Illinois mention, EA Sports All-American Second Team pick[17] and another Parade All-American selection.[18] Entering his senior year, Rose was ranked the fifth best prospect in the nation by Sports Illustrated. In January 2007, Simeon traveled to Madison Square Garden to play Rice High School and star guard Kemba Walker.[19] The Wolverines lost 53–51.[20][21] The season's highlight was a nationally televised contest on ESPN against Virginia perennial power Oak Hill Academy two weeks later. Matched up with hyped junior guard Brandon Jennings, Rose had 28 points, 9 assists, and 8 rebounds and in a 78–75 win.[22][23] For his performance, USA Today named him their high school player of the week.[24] Simeon went on to repeat as Public League champions[25] and defended their state championship, defeating O'Fallon High School 77–54.[26] In doing so, Simeon became the first Chicago Public League school to win two straight state championships. In his final high school game, Rose scored 2 points, but pulled down 7 rebounds and totaled 8 assists, while Simeon big man Tim Flowers scored 35 points.[27] The Wolverines ended the season 33–2 and ranked first in the nation by Sports Illustrated[28] and 6th on USA Today's Super 25.[29] Rose averaged 25.2 points, 9.1 assists, 8.8 rebounds and 3.4 steals. Overall, Simeon's record while Rose played was 120–12.[12] After his senior year, Rose was again All-State after being named Illinois Mr. Basketball[30] and was named to the McDonald's All-American team.[31] He was also awarded with First Team honors by Parade selection and USA Today[32] and USA Today First Team All-American. Rose was selected to play in the Jordan Brand All-Star Game and Nike Hoop Summit. In 2009, Rose was named the decade's third greatest high school point guard by ESPN RISE magazine behind Chris Paul and T. J. Ford,[33] and had his jersey number (#25) retired along with Ben Wilson.[34] Rose accepted a scholarship to play for the University of Memphis Tigers under John Calipari, who recruited him after seeing him play in an AAU game.[35] Strong efforts were made by Indiana University and in-state University of Illinois to sign Rose to their own programs.[36] Illinois in particular planned to pair Rose and their five-star recruit Eric Gordon, who had played AAU basketball with Rose.[37] Gordon, however, retracted his verbal commitment from the Fighting Illini, opting to play for Indiana, and Rose subsequently gave his verbal commitment before the start of his senior season.[38] Rose chose Memphis because of the school's history of putting players in the NBA and the prospect of Rod Strickland, a 17-year veteran of the league, mentoring him. Rose switched to #23, due to the fact that #25 had been retired by the school in honor of Penny Hardaway.[39] With the addition of Rose and led by veteran upperclassmen Joey Dorsey and Chris Douglas-Roberts, the Tigers started out the season ranked third in the nation. Memphis sprinted to a 26–0 start and claimed the number one ranking in the country for the first time in over 25 years before falling to the University of Tennessee Volunteers 66–62 in February.[40] Memphis was able to bounce back and capture the Conference USA tournament to qualify for the \"Big Dance\" with a 33–1 record.[41] Rose averaged 14.9 points per game, 4.7 assists and 4.5 rebounds per game during the regular season and earned All-American Third Team honors among others.[42] He finished as a finalist for the Bob Cousy Award as well as the John R. Wooden Award.[43] Memphis was seeded No. 1 in the South Region. Rose earned high praise for his increased focus on defense, hounding Texas Longhorn guard D. J. Augustin into a low-percentage game in the Elite Eight.[44] In a match-up against UCLA in the Final Four, Rose finished with 25 points and 9 rebounds to lead the Tigers to an 85–67 win and a trip to the NCAA championship game against the Kansas Jayhawks.[45] The win set an NCAA mark for most wins in a season (38).[46] Against Kansas, Rose scored 17 points on 7–of–17 shooting, along with six rebounds and seven assists, but missed a critical free throw at the end of the second half as Memphis fell in overtime, 75–68.[47] Memphis concluded the season 38–2. Rose was named to the All-Final Four team after averaging 20.8 points, 6.5 rebounds and 6.0 assists per game.[48] On April 15, Rose announced he would forgo his final three seasons at Memphis and declared for the 2008 NBA draft.[49] According to Sheri Lipman of the University of Memphis legal counsel, a month after the loss to Kansas, the NCAA sent a letter to the school stating that Rose had \"an invalidated standardized test score the previous year at Chicago's Simeon High School.\" The next January, the NCAA sent another letter, charging Memphis with knowing that Rose had someone else take his SAT for him.[50] Memphis started its own investigation and sent its response back on April 24.[51] On May 28, 2009, the Memphis Commercial Appeal obtained the letter through the Freedom of Information Act and released it. Although the player's name was redacted due to privacy laws, process of elimination, and sources revealed the player as Derrick Rose. The next day, in a separate investigation, James Sullivan, Inspector General of the Chicago Public Schools district's Board of Education, released a report of his investigation stating that four student-athletes of a CPS school had one-month grade boosts to alter their college transcripts.[52] The Chicago Sun-Times revealed the school as Simeon Career Academy and that three of the four were Rose and his former teammates Kevin Johnson and Tim Flowers, prominent members of the back-to-back championship teams.[52] The newspaper claimed that Rose's grade was changed from a D to a C.[52] Another part of the report stated that \"high school staff lost the original permanent records for three of the above mentioned students athletes\" (including the unknown four).[53] Sullivan started the investigation because \"none of the grade changes were supported by any documentation.\" He also failed to find a suspect as \"at least seven people at Simeon had the ability to access student grades and records.\"[52] Illinois High School Association (IHSA) executive director Marty Hickman reacted by saying, \"It is obvious that this is worth taking a look into.\"[53] Robert Smith, who coached the Wolverines from 2004 to 2007, denied any wrongdoing.[52] District spokeswoman Monique Bond said the students involved probably did not know about the grade change. Allegations surfaced that Rose's brother, Reggie, had been allowed to travel with the team for free on several occasions.[54] Memphis contended that it had learned of the allegations about Rose's SAT score shortly after he enrolled at the school. It conducted its own investigation, in which Rose was questioned by four school officials. Ultimately, Memphis was unable to find any evidence that Rose had cheated based on what was available at the time and cleared him to play.[55] Rose released a statement through his lawyer Daniel E. Reidy: \"Mr. Rose is aware of the allegations reported in the press. Mr. Rose cooperated fully with the University of Memphis' athletic and legal departments’ investigation of this issue when he was a student, and that investigation uncovered no wrongdoing on his part.\" On August 20, 2009, the NCAA vacated Memphis' 2007–08 season. It took the position that because the Educational Testing Service voided Rose's SAT score after Rose's freshman year at Memphis, strict liability required that Rose be retroactively declared ineligible.[56] It also determined that even without the questions about his test score, Rose would have lost his eligibility in December 2007 due to Reggie Rose being allowed to travel for free.[57] On May 28, 2010, Rose, former Memphis basketball coach John Calipari, and Memphis athletic director R.C. Johnson reached a $100,000 out-of-court settlement with three attorneys who represented Memphis season ticket holders and threatened a lawsuit over the vacated 2007–08 season. The Memphis Commercial Appeal first reported on this settlement in October 2011.[58] Rose was selected with the first overall pick in the 2008 draft by the Chicago Bulls.[1][59] He was selected to the U.S. Select Team to scrimmage against and prepare the National Team for the Olympics in Beijing.[60][61][62] In mid-July, he played two games in the Orlando Pro Summer League until forced out by tendinitis in his right knee, ending his summer,[63] but returned in October to play all eight preseason games.[64] Rose became the first Bulls draftee to score 10 points or more in his first 10 games since Michael Jordan,[65] and earned Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month honors for November and December.[66][67] During the All-Star Weekend, Rose played in the Rookie Challenge,[68] and won the Skills Challenge, where he beat out several All-Stars to become the first rookie to claim the trophy.[69] Overcoming a January and February slump, Rose returned to form and won monthly rookie honors in March. Meanwhile, the Bulls, re-energized by the trade deadline acquisitions of John Salmons and Brad Miller, finished the regular season on a 12–4 spurt to qualify as the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference. Rose won Rookie of the Year, joining Jordan (1985) and Elton Brand (2000) as the only Bulls to do so.[70] He was also the first number-one draft pick since LeBron James to win the award. He averaged 16.8 points on 47.5% field goal shooting, 6.3 assists (leading all rookies) and 3.9 rebounds per game and was also named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team.[71] In his playoff debut against the defending champion Boston Celtics, Rose recorded 36 points (tying Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's NBA record for points scored by a rookie in his playoff debut, set in 1970), 11 assists, and 4 rebounds as the Bulls prevailed in a 105–103 overtime win on the road.[72][73][74] Rose became the second player in NBA history to record 35 points and 10 assists in his playoff debut, after Chris Paul. Rose averaged 19.7 points on 47.5% shooting, 6.3 assists and 4.9 rebounds per game in his first playoff series, as the Bulls were defeated by the Celtics in seven games.[75] Rose's sophomore season started off with an ankle injury in his first preseason game. Rose would go on to miss the rest of the preseason. Rose started the Bulls' season opener against the San Antonio Spurs but played limited minutes. Rose's ankle bothered him for most of November, but as his ankle healed, his game improved. On January 16, 2010, against the Washington Wizards, Rose recorded 37 points, including a layup to win the game 121–119 with 5.4 seconds to go in the second overtime.[76] On January 28, Rose was elected to his first career All-Star Game as a reserve for the Eastern Conference, making him the first Bulls player to be selected since Michael Jordan in 1998.[77] Rose ended up with eight points, four assists and three steals in the game. On April 13, 2010, Rose scored 39 points against the Boston Celtics, making 15–22 field goals and 9–10 free throws. The Bulls once again made the playoffs in the 2009–10 season, finishing with a 41–41 record. In the playoffs Rose averaged 26.8 points and 7.2 assists, but the Bulls lost in five games to the Cleveland Cavaliers.[78] On October 30, 2010, in the Bulls' second game of the season, Rose scored 39 points in a 101–91 win against the Detroit Pistons. Two days after, Rose contributed 13 assists, helping Luol Deng score a career-high 40 points in a win against the Portland Trail Blazers. On December 10, Rose scored 29 points and had 9 assists, leading the Bulls to their first victory over the Los Angeles Lakers since December 19, 2006. On January 16, 2011, Rose outdueled fellow Chicago native Dwyane Wade in a 99–96 win over the Miami Heat, scoring 34 points, of which 11 in the fourth quarter.[79] On January 17, he recorded his first career triple-double with 22 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists in a 96–84 win over the Memphis Grizzlies.[80] On January 27, Rose was announced as a starting guard on the 2011 NBA All-Star Team for the East squad.[81] On February 17, in the Bulls' last game before the All-Star break, Rose set a career-high with 42 points, while also recording 8 assists and 5 rebounds, as the Bulls beat the San Antonio Spurs 109–99. On March 19, he equalled that tally in a 115–108 overtime loss by the Indiana Pacers.[82] The loss was only one of two that the Bulls suffered in the last 23 games of the season. On March 26, Rose had a career-high 17 assists, along with 30 points, in a 95–87 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks. On April 10, Rose scored 39 points on 13-of-17 shooting in a 102–99 win over the Orlando Magic, in one of the final regular season matches of the season which saw the Bulls go undefeated in the month of April. On April 13, Rose put on a show at the Madison Square Garden with 26 points, shooting 10-of-19 and throwing down several crowd-pleasing dunks in a 103–90 win over the Knicks, leading coach Mike D'Antoni to compliment him in the post-game interview: \"His athletic ability is ridiculous. He's come farther, quicker, faster than anyone expected; he's playing at a level that not many people play.\"[83] At the end of the 2010–11 NBA season the Bulls finished with a league leading record of 62–20.[84] Their 60+ wins was the Bulls' first such season since 1997–98 and sixth 60+ win in franchise history.[85] At season's end, Rose became only the third player since the 1972–73 NBA season to record 2,000 points and 600 assists in a single season. The other two players were LeBron James and Michael Jordan.[86] On May 3, Rose was named the NBA Most Valuable Player, joining Jordan as the only players to receive the award in Chicago Bulls history.[87] At 22 years and 6 months old, Rose also became the youngest player to receive the award (Wes Unseld, formerly the youngest MVP, won the award in 1968–69 at age 23 years, 2 months). In the 2011 NBA playoffs, the Bulls defeated the Indiana Pacers and Atlanta Hawks in the first two rounds. In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Bulls faced the Miami Heat, led by James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. The Bulls lost the series in five games. During the 2011 playoffs, Rose averaged 27.1 points per game, but only shot 39% from the field and 24% for three-pointers.[88] In December 2011, Rose signed a five-year contract extension with the Bulls for $94.8 million. The contract was 30 percent of the Bulls' salary cap, the maximum allowed under a rule dubbed the \"Derrick Rose Rule\" from the 2011 NBA Collective Bargaining Agreement.[89] On December 25, in the Christmas Day matchup against the Los Angeles Lakers, Rose scored 22 points on 9-from-13 shooting, and hit a game winning floater with 4.8 seconds left to secure an 88–87 win for the Bulls.[90] On January 11, 2012, Rose had a double-double in a 111–100 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves, scoring 31 points (of which 14 on 6-of-7 shooting in the first quarter) and dishing 11 assists in a much-anticipated battle with young Spanish guard Ricky Rubio.[91] On January 30, against the Eastern Conference rival Miami Heat, Rose scored 34 points, but missed two key free throws with 22 seconds left, and then had a jumper bounce off the rim with three seconds on the clock, resulting with a 97–93 loss for the Bulls.[92] However, he bounced back the next day, scoring a season-high 35 points in a 98–88 win over the Washingtons Wizards, with coach Tom Thibodeau stating after the game that Rose \"imposes his will on everybody\".[93] In February 2012, Rose was voted as an All-Star Game starter for the second consecutive year. He was the second leading vote getter behind Orlando Magic center Dwight Howard. On March 5, 2012, Rose tied his season-high with 35 points against the Philadelphia 76ers, including a basket with 20 seconds left to seal a 96–91 win. Philadelphia coach Doug Collins tried to have defensive specialists Jrue Holiday, Andre Iguodala and Evan Turner take turns guarding Rose, but to little effect, as he hit a series of spectacular shots and added eight assists to announce his return to MVP form.[94] On March 7, Rose confirmed his clutch reputation as he hit a step back fadeaway jumper to beat the buzzer against the Milwaukee Bucks, handing the Bulls a 106–104 win. He recorded another double-double with 30 points and 11 assists.[95] The Bulls ended the season on a high, winning 18 out of their last 20 games, as Rose averaged 21.8 points per game, along with a career-high 7.9 assists in 35.3 minutes per game. Despite having played a career low 39 games due to injuries, Rose managed to record nine double-doubles. He also helped Luol Deng become an All-Star for the first time in his career. During Game 1 of the first round of the playoffs against the Philadelphia 76ers, Rose injured his left knee while trying to jump. He was immediately helped off the court. The injury occurred when the Bulls were leading by 12 points with 1:22 left to play. Rose came up just short of a triple-double, finishing with 23 points, 9 assists, and 9 rebounds in 37 minutes of action.[96] An MRI later revealed that Rose tore the ACL in his left knee and would miss the rest of the playoffs.[97] Rose had surgery performed on May 12, 2012, with an estimated recovery period of 8–12 months.[4] Rose returned to full contact practice in January 2013,[98] and was cleared by doctors to play in March,[99] but he did not appear in a game during the 2012–13 NBA season. He was heavily criticized by Bulls fans for his decision to sit out the season, but maintained that he must listen to his body and will only return when he's 100 percent healed.[100][101] Despite Rose's absence, the Bulls advanced to the Eastern Conference Semifinals, where they lost to the eventual champions, the Miami Heat. Rose's much awaited return came on October 5, 2013, in a pre-season game against the Indiana Pacers. He had a slow start but scored his first point in the first quarter. He finished the game with 13 points in 20 minutes of play.[102] On October 16, 2013, Rose returned to play in Chicago for the first time, scoring 22 points against the Detroit Pistons. \"I think I'm way more explosive now. Like getting to the rim. I think I can take contact a little bit better. And as far as jumping-wise, I think I can jump even higher. They tested my vertical — I increased it by 5 inches,\" Rose said after the win.[103] During the pre-season, Rose averaged 20.7 points and 5.0 assists. His first official game was in 107–95 loss against the defending champions Miami Heat on October 29. Rose was limited to 12 points, while having four assists in 34 minutes of play. He played his usual minutes, but was inefficient from the field, shooting 4–15.[104] Two days later, he played his first official home game against the New York Knicks where he hit the game-winning floater in an 82–81 win. He had 18 points, six rebounds and 3 assists.[105] On November 3, 2013, Rose scored 13 points and committed 8 turnovers in the loss against the Philadelphia 76ers.[106] He struggled in his return, shooting 28.8% from the field and averaging 5.7 turnovers in his first three games.[107] On November 22, Rose injured his right knee during a game against the Portland Trail Blazers. An MRI the next day confirmed that Rose tore his right knee meniscus and that surgery was required.[108] At the time, Rose was averaging 15.9 points and 4.3 assists in 31.1 minutes per game. On November 25, Rose underwent surgery on the torn meniscus in his right knee.[5] The same day, the Bulls announced Rose was out for the season, after a successful surgery.[109] Rose returned from injury to play in the Bulls' season opener against the New York Knicks on October 29, 2014, and recorded 13 points and five assists in 21 minutes of action. He went on to score a season-high 32 points on January 14, 2015, against the Washington Wizards.[110] On January 28, Rose scored a step-back jumper with seven seconds on the clock to give the Bulls a 113–111 overtime win over the Golden State Warriors; however he only made 13 out of 33 shots from the field, and had a career-high 11 turnovers.[111] Two weeks later Rose was ruled out again with another knee injury. On February 24, it was announced Rose required another round of surgery on his right knee and was ruled out indefinitely. An exam and subsequent MRI confirmed a medial meniscus tear of the right knee, the same injury he sustained on November 22, 2013, against the Portland Trail Blazers.[112][113] On February 27, he was deemed a possibility of returning toward the end of the season after he underwent successful surgery and was ruled out for just four to six weeks.[114] Rose returned to action on April 8 after a 20-game absence, and working on a minutes restriction, he was 3-of-9 from the field and finished with nine points in 19 minutes as the Bulls lost to the Orlando Magic.[115] He appeared in 51 games, the most he'd played since the 2010–11 season.[116] On April 18, 2015, Rose played in his first playoff game since Game 1 of the 2012 playoffs (the game where he tore his left ACL). Rose finished with 23 points and seven assists on 9-of-16 shooting.[117] He had a vintage performance in Game 3 in which he scored 34 points, making five three-pointers from nine attempts and adding eight assists in a tight 113–106 win in overtime, helping his team to a 3–0 lead against the Milwaukee Bucks.[118] During the Bulls' first round series against the Bucks, Rose averaged 21.5 points per game. On May 8, Rose banked in a three-pointer at the buzzer and scored 30 points to give the Bulls a 99–96 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers and a 2–1 lead in the Eastern Conference semi-finals.[119] He followed up that performance by recording 31 points in Game 4, including a contested layup to tie the game at 84–84; however, after the referees failed to award a technical foul to Cavaliers coach David Blatt for attempting to call a timeout without having any remaining, LeBron James hit a jumper from the corner in the last second to win the game 86–84 and tie the series 2–2.[120] After the deflating loss, the Bulls couldn't stop the Cavaliers who won the final two games to take the series in six games. A preseason left orbital bone fracture saw Rose begin the regular season wearing a face mask.[121] On November 5, 2015, Rose scored a then season-high 29 points on 12-of-25 shooting in a 104–98 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder. He showed signs of his old MVP ability as he scored 10 points over the final three and a half minutes to lift the Bulls after they blew a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter.[122] On December 18, he scored a season-high 34 points in a 147–144 quadruple overtime loss to the Detroit Pistons.[123] On February 5, 2016, he had a season-best game with 30 points, 9 rebounds and 8 assists in a 115–110 loss to the Denver Nuggets.[124] On February 19, in a rematch of the previous playoffs' Eastern Conference semi-finals, Rose won the individual matchup against Cleveland Cavaliers point guard Kyrie Irving, scoring 28 points to Irving's 19, but the Cavaliers prevailed 106–95 over the Bulls.[125] On February 22, Rose spoiled Kobe Bryant's farewell tour in his final season as an NBA player, as he led the Bulls in scoring with 24 points in a 126–115 win over the Lakers in Bryant's last game at the United Center.[126] On March 25, Rose again dazzled the Madison Square Garden, scoring 30 points with a variety of acrobatic finishes and circus shots; however the Bulls lost 106–94 against the Knicks.[127] The season ended with a disappointment for the Bulls, as they didn't reach the playoffs for the first time since 2008, leading to a change in direction for the franchise. While Rose averaged a respectable 16.4 points and 4.7 assists per game in 66 games, the decline of his production, efficiency and on-court impact indicated that he was no longer capable of performing at same level as his pre-injury MVP self.[128][129] Journalist A.J. Neuharth-Keutsch asserted for USA Today that Rose \"struggled to find the explosiveness, confidence and versatility that he once possessed\",[130] while ESPN's Nick Friedell lamented that \"whatever the reason, Rose evolved into a different player - glimpses of brilliance were still there on certain nights, but the virtuoso performances were not\".[131] On June 22, 2016, Rose was traded, along with Justin Holiday and a 2017 second-round draft pick, to the New York Knicks in exchange for José Calderón, Jerian Grant and Robin Lopez.[132] Rose opted for the number 25 shirt which he wore in his high school days, and stated that the Knicks are a \"super team\" with him, Carmelo Anthony and Kristaps Porziņģis among the ranks.[133] It was later revealed that the point guard cried upon receiving the news from his agent that the Bulls decided to trade him.[134] Rose made his debut for the Knicks in the team's season opener on October 25 against the Cleveland Cavaliers. In 29 minutes of action, he scored 17 points on 7-of-17 shooting in a 117–88 loss.[135] On November 4, Rose returned to Chicago for the first time as a member of the Knicks, recording 15 points and 11 assists in a 117–104 win over the Bulls.[136] On November 17, he scored a season-high 27 points in a 119–112 loss to the Washington Wizards.[137] He topped that mark on November 28, scoring 30 points in a 112–103 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder.[138] On December 3, Rose scored 24 points on 9-of-15 shooting against the Minnesota Timberwolves, hitting two key free throws with half a minute to go, to give the Knicks an insurmountable eight-point lead before ultimately winning 118–114.[139] On December 12, he scored 25 points in a 118–112 win over the Los Angeles Lakers, hitting a clutch push shot with 19.4 seconds left to put the game beyond doubt.[140] On January 10, 2017, Rose was fined an undisclosed amount after he reportedly flew to Chicago to be with his mother but did not notify team officials ahead of their game against the New Orleans Pelicans on January 9.[141] Eight days later, he matched his season high with 30 points in a 117–106 win over the Boston Celtics.[142] As the season progressed, Rose increasingly expressed frustration with coach Jeff Hornacek's implementation of the triangle offense, describing it as \"random\" and \"confusing\".[143] On April 2, 2017, he was ruled out for the rest of the season after tearing the meniscus in his left knee, necessitating a fourth round of knee surgery for Rose in his nine-year career.[144] The Knicks vastly underperformed in the 2016–17 season, ending with a 31–51 record and missing the playoffs. On July 25, 2017, Rose signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers, joining forces with LeBron James.[145] In his debut for the Cavaliers in their season opener against the Boston Celtics on October 17, 2017, Rose scored 14 points in a 102–99 win.[146] In his highest-scoring game for the Cavaliers, on November 4, Rose recorded 20 points in a 130–122 win over the Washington Wizards. Four days later, against the Milwaukee Bucks, he suffered an ankle injury, after being fouled by Greg Monroe on a drive to the basket. On November 24, 2017, Rose left the team to re-evaluate his future in the NBA. His persistent injury issues caused him to question his desire to continue playing.[147] He returned to working with the Cavaliers' medical staff in early December in hopes of recovering from a sprained left ankle and bone spurs.[148] On January 18, 2018, Rose returned to the line-up after missing more than two months with ankle injuries and scored nine points in 13 minutes in a 104–103 win over the Orlando Magic.[149] On February 8, 2018, Rose was acquired by the Utah Jazz in a three-team trade that also involved the Cavaliers and the Sacramento Kings.[150] Two days later, he was waived by the Jazz.[151] On March 8, 2018, Rose signed with the Minnesota Timberwolves,[152] reuniting him with Tom Thibodeau, Jimmy Butler and Taj Gibson. After slowly getting back to his rhythm towards the end of the regular season, Rose averaged 14.2 points in 23.8 minutes per game in the playoffs, as the Timberwolves lost 4–1 to the Houston Rockets in the first round.[153] His best performance of the series came on April 24, 2018, in Game 5, as he scored 17 points on 7-of-11 shooting in 32 minutes on the floor, including 2-of-2 from distance; however the Rockets won 119–100 after outscoring the Timberwolves 50–20 in the third quarter which Rose started on the bench.[154] On July 4, 2018, Rose re-signed with the Timberwolves for the 2018–19 season.[155] On October 31, in his first start of the season, Rose scored a career-high 50 points in a 128–125 win over the Utah Jazz, securing the victory with a block on Utah's final shot as time expired.[156] Rose shot 19-of-31 in 41 minutes on the court, hit four three pointers, and had 15 points in the last quarter, of which six came in the last minute. After the buzzer sounded, an emotional Rose burst into tears as his teammates swarmed him while MVP chants came from the crowd. In the post-game interview, when asked what the feat meant to him, Rose said: \"Everything, I worked my [expletive] off\".[157] He received praise from players all over the league; LeBron James called Rose \"a superhero\" and a true definition of perseverance, while Dwyane Wade said that Rose was an example of never giving up on yourself.[158] Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau after the game said that Rose \"has the character, the humility and the courage\", adding that he is among the most mentally tough people he had come across.[159] On November 8, Rose recorded 31 points in a 114–110 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers, hitting a career-best 7 three pointers from 9 attempts.[160] On December 26, he had 24 points and eight assists and again received MVP chants in a 119–94 win over the Bulls in Chicago. It was only his second career game in the United Center against his former team.[161] On January 15, 2019, against the Philadelphia 76ers, Rose reached 10,000 career points.[162] On January 20, he scored 29 of his 31 points in the second half and hit an 18-footer with 0.6 seconds left to give the Timberwolves a 116–114 victory over the Phoenix Suns.[163] Right ankle trouble saw Rose miss 11 of 19 games spanning late December to late January.[164] He missed an additional three games in early February.[165] On March 21, he was ruled out for the rest of the season with a right elbow injury.[166] Rose ended the season with 18.0 points and 4.3 assists per game, with a career-high 37% field goal percentage for three pointers. However, the Timberwolves missed the playoffs, as they ended the season with a 36–46 record, enough only for the 11th spot in the Western Conference. On July 7, 2019, Rose signed with the Detroit Pistons.[167] On October 23, he made his debut for the Pistons, logging 18 points, three rebounds, and nine assists in a 119–110 win over the Indiana Pacers.[168] On December 9, Rose scored the game winner in a 105–103 win over the New Orleans Pelicans, hitting a buzzer beater with a close range fadeaway jumper against Jrue Holiday. Rose scored 17 out of his 21 points in the fourth quarter, where he shot 7-of-8 from the field, including two three pointers from two attempts.[169] On December 15, in the 115–107 win against the Houston Rockets, he had a double-double with 20 points and 12 assists, scoring ten points in the final quarter.[170] Rose became the first player in Pistons history to record seven consecutive 20+ point games as a reserve, which also coincided with his career-high 14-game streak of scoring 20 points or more.[171] The most notable games of the streak included a 116–103 win over the Boston Celtics on January 15, 2020, in which Rose scored 22 points on 11-of-13 shooting,[172] followed by a 136–103 win against the Atlanta Hawks three days later, where he had 27 points and 9 assists.[173] The streak ended after he suffered a groin injury during a game against the Denver Nuggets.[174] During the month of January when he accomplished the feat, Rose averaged 22 points, six assists and three rebounds, while shooting 51% from the floor.[175] In his third game after returning from injury, Rose scored a season-high 31 points en route to a win against the Phoenix Suns.[176][177] Despite a strong individual season by Rose as the team's sixth man, the Pistons ended the season at the 13th place in the Eastern Conference with a disappointing 20–46 record, having struggled without their best player Blake Griffin, who featured in only 15 games due to injuries. On February 8, 2021, Rose was traded back to the New York Knicks for Dennis Smith Jr. and a 2021 second-round draft pick, once again reuniting him with coach Tom Thibodeau and former teammate Taj Gibson.[178] Rose made his return debut on February 20 in a 98–96 loss against the Miami Heat, in which he provided an immediate offensive spark for the Knicks, scoring 14 points and dishing three assists.[179] He peaked in May, scoring 25 points on 11-of-15 shooting in the 118–104 win against the Memphis Grizzlies on May 4,[180] and equalling that tally while adding eight assists six days later in a 106–100 win against the Los Angeles Clippers.[181] On May 12, in an overtime loss against the Los Angeles Lakers, he recorded a season-high 27 points with 6 assists and 6 rebounds.[182] Rose was a major contributor coming from the bench, helping the Knicks finish fourth in the East and placing third in the Sixth Man of the Year voting.[183] On May 24, 2021, in his first playoff game since 2018, Rose had 17 points, five assists and five rebounds off the bench as the Knicks lost to the Atlanta Hawks 107–105.[184] In Game 2, coach Thibodeau put Rose in the starting unit for the second half after initially being on the bench, and he responded with a game-high 26 points for the Knicks, leading his team to a 101–92 win to even the series.[185] On May 28, during Game 3 of the Knicks' first round series against the Atlanta Hawks, Rose made his first playoff start since the 2015 conference semifinals, recording a season-high 30 points, as well as six rebounds and five assists, in a 105–94 loss as Atlanta took a 2–1 series lead.[186] The Hawks went on to win the series 4–1, as Rose suffered a knee injury in the closing of the series.[187] He averaged 19.4 points over the five games, leading the Knicks in scoring for the series. On August 18, 2021, the Knicks extended Rose's contract by three years with a $43 million deal.[188][189] On November 3, Rose surpassed 12,000 career points in a 111–98 loss against the Indiana Pacers.[190] On November 6, Rose helped the Knicks erase a 21-point deficit against the champion Milwaukee Bucks, scoring 23 points off the bench on 10-of-18 shooting in a 113–98 win.[191] On December 17, 2021, in a 116–103 win over the Houston Rockets, Rose suffered a right ankle injury.[192] Five days later, he had surgery on his ankle and was ruled out for at least two months.[193] On February 25, 2022, Rose underwent another procedure to address a skin infection on his ankle and was ruled out indefinitely.[194] In the 2022–23 season, Rose averaged only 12 minutes per game from the bench and was removed from the Knicks rotation by Tom Thibodeau in December 2022.[195] On June 24, 2023, the Knicks declined Rose's team option for the 2023–24 season, rendering him a free agent.[196] On July 3, 2023, Rose signed with the Memphis Grizzlies.[197] He chose to wear the number 23, the same number he wore when playing for the University of Memphis.[198] He received an ovation in his debut from Memphis fans on October 26, as he scored 8 points in 16 minutes off the bench in a 111–104 loss to the New Orleans Pelicans.[199] In November 2023, Rose missed eight games due to left knee soreness.[200] On November 24, Rose scored a then season-high 17 points on 8-of-9 shooting in a 110–89 loss to the Phoenix Suns.[201] Rose was named a starter for the Grizzlies for the first time on November 30 against the Utah Jazz, helping his team to a 105–91 win with 14 points on 7-of-11 shooting from the field, and nine assists.[202] On December 14, Rose posted a season-high 19 points in a 117–104 loss against the Houston Rockets, playing a season-high 31 minutes. Two days later, in a rematch against the Rockets, Rose suffered a hamstring injury on his left leg, which kept recurring in January and February, reducing him to sporadic appearances and limited minutes for the Grizzlies.[citation needed] On March 30, 2024, he was ruled out for the rest of the season with a lower back injury suffered in the beginning of March.[203] He finished the season with an average of 8 points, 3 assists and 2 rebounds in 16 minutes per game, having played in only 24 games due to injuries.[citation needed] Rose indicated his intention to return to the Grizzlies for the 2024–25 season.[204] However, on September 23, 2024, he was waived by the Grizzlies.[205] On September 26, 2024, Rose announced his retirement.[206] Rose was a member of the United States men's national basketball teams that won gold medals at the 2010 and 2014 FIBA World Cup. Standing at 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 m) and weighing 200 pounds (91 kg), Rose played mostly at the point guard position. He averaged 17.4 points per game for his career.[207] Rose has one All-NBA selection to his name in 2011, the year he was also voted NBA MVP of the regular season. He also won the NBA Rookie of the Year award in 2009.[208] In his prime in Chicago, Rose was widely considered to be one of the most athletic point guards in NBA history before a string of knee injuries slowed him down.[209] A combination of explosiveness, leaping ability and speed allowed him to attack the basket frequently, using a repertoire of acrobatic finishes to score over taller players. Rose clocked in a maximum vertical jump of 40 inches during the 2008 NBA Combine.[210] After the injuries, Rose compensated for his loss of athleticism by becoming more patient, methodical and creative with his shot selection, which increased his efficiency compared to his early years when he considered himself to be more \"reckless\".[211] His control, composure and finesse helped him keep his place among the best rim finishers in the NBA in the 2019–20 season, with his 4.7 field goals made on drives coming second behind only Luka Dončić and Russell Westbrook with 4.8, while he ranked first in the league in field goal percentage on attempts from drives among players with at least 6.0 attempts with 56.4%.[212] In the process of reinventing his game, Rose also increased his reliance on floaters, runners and push shots, leading the league in the 2020–21 season in accuracy with 53% from the field on these attempts.[213] Due to Rose's injury history, in his later years his minutes on the court were reduced and he became more of a role player. Rose was never a knock-down shooter from the arc, shooting 30 percent during his career.[214] However, in the later stages of his career, he improved his shooting mechanics and managed to develop a reliable three point shot.[215] In his second stint with the New York Knicks, Rose shot above 40 percent from three. Rose started using the bank shot more frequently and with greater success during the 2015–16 season, after struggling with his shooting due to what he attributed to depth perception issues following eye surgery in 2015.[216][217] Rose received criticism about his defense early in his career,[218][219] but he was praised for his defensive contributions as a veteran in his second Knicks stint.[220] Rose has also been widely recognized for his leadership skills and mentoring of younger players.[221][222] Rose is a Christian and has spoken about his faith, saying \"God does everything for a reason\".[238] He wears a wristband that says \"In Jesus' Name I Play\"[239][240] and has several tattoos about his faith.[241] On October 9, 2012, Rose's ex-girlfriend, Mieka Reese, gave birth to their son Derrick Jr.[242] In 2016, Rose started dating model and fitness influencer Alaina Anderson. The two married on September 7, 2023, in Los Angeles, after getting engaged in 2021.[243][244] Their daughter Layla was born in 2018 and their son London in 2019.[245] Rose's agent is former Bulls guard B. J. Armstrong.[246] In 2018, Rose introduced The Rose Scholars, a scholarship program to help students achieve a higher education.[247][248] Rose is an avid chess player, with The Sporting News saying, \"There is no bigger (chess) fanatic in the NBA than Rose.\"[249][250] In 2016, Rose was involved in a federal civil lawsuit to assess whether he and two friends raped an unnamed former girlfriend in August 2013.[251] In the months before the alleged gang-rape, Rose's accuser, referred to as \"Jane Doe\" in court transcripts, testified that Rose made her uncomfortable by asking her to perform sexual acts for him or to involve other people in their sex life; he would sometimes get angry when she refused.[252] Doe also mentioned that on the day of the incident, she was drugged against her consent, and alternated in and out of consciousness.[253] During the trial, Rose expressed difficulty and uncertainty with the definition of the word \"consent\".[254] In October 2016, he was found not liable by an eight-member jury.[255] An appeal in 2018 was denied.[256] Rose was the cover athlete of NBA 2K13 alongside fellow NBA players Kevin Durant and Blake Griffin.[257] Rose was the lone cover athlete for the 2K Sports Downloadable Content game, NBA 2K10 Draft Combine, which was released on Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3.[258] Rose is a part-owner and spokesman for the Chicago-based Giordano's Pizzeria.[259] In 2008, Rose signed a shoe deal with Adidas for $1 million per year.[260][261] He has also signed with Wilson Sporting Goods.[262] Other endorsement deals include Skullcandy headphones, Powerade, Force Factor sports drinks and a suburban Chicago Nissan dealership.[263] In May 2018, it was announced that the Adidas D Rose 9's would be released in July 2018.[264] In 2011, Rose was estimated by Crain's Chicago Business to earn $1.5–$2.5 million annually in endorsements, ranking just outside the top 10 NBA players in that category.[265] In 2012, it was reported that Rose signed a contract extension with Adidas, worth $185 million over 14 years.[266]",

CHICAGO -- \"MVP\" chants bounced off the walls inside of a sold-out United Center, but it wasn't for any of the current Chicago Bulls players or the visiting New York Knicks. Fans were on their feet as Bulls legend and Chicago native Derrick Rose walked out of the home tunnel at halftime of the Bulls' 139-126 win over the Knicks Saturday night. Rose has walked out of that tunnel 447 times in a Bulls jersey, but on Saturday he donned a black and red pinstripe suit as he stepped onto the court for Derrick Rose Night. Rose formally announced his retirement prior to the start of the season, and the Bulls wasted no time honoring the city's favorite son, who was Chicago's No. 1 overall pick in 2008 and played seven seasons with the team. DRose comes out to MVP chants in Chicago! 🌹🗣️ pic.twitter.com/VhvCR4BzAX Several of Rose's former teammates were on hand for the night's festivities, including Joakim Noah and Luol Deng, as well as his college coach John Calipari. Noah gave an impassioned speech at halftime honoring Rose, bringing the Chicago native to tears as Noah led what was one of many \"MVP\" chants of the night. \"You're not only the MVP, you're the People's Champ,\" Noah said of Rose, who became the youngest MVP in NBA history at the age of 22. \"You're not only the MVP. You're The People's Champ\" –– Derrick Rose tears up during Joakim Noah's tribute pic.twitter.com/M4dq0Lw8dO Earlier in the day, the Bulls announced that the team would retire Rose's No. 1 jersey next season, something he said he still hasn't processed, but he certainly will at a later date.. \"[Tonight] is about me giving everybody that's in this room, everybody that was a part of the story, the journey, the good, the bad, the ugly. It's celebrating everyone,\" Rose said. As the Bulls were giving Rose his flowers -- both literally and metaphorically -- for what he meant to the franchise, he in turn gave the city his thanks. In the days leading up to Rose's celebration, the Chicago native could be seen around the city hosting a pop-up flower shop, playing at his alma mater Simeon Career Academy alongside his son in a pickup game and opening a community garden in his childhood neighborhood of Englewood. \"I understand, coming from Chicago that it's tough love, you know, I mean, it's a lot of tough love,\" Rose said. \"I was just telling my friends that you can forget about the the love sometimes, and just give toughness out. Coming back, me being raised off of that tough love, I just wanted to show the love. There's toughness too, but you don't gotta be tough all the time.\" Hosting \"Derrick Rose Night\" when the Knicks were in town was planned precisely so that the guy who coached Rose more than any other person in his career -- current Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau -- could be in attendance. It also worked because Rose played four seasons over two different stints with the Knicks. So naturally, both the Bulls and Knicks players wore special shooting shirts that had \"1.4.25\" written across the chest to signify Rose's three jersey numbers from the Bulls, Knicks and Simeon. It also just so happened to work out to the exact date the Bulls would be honoring Rose, which has now been officially deemed Derrick Rose day in Chicago. Here's a look at the full halftime ceremony from Saturday night. The full Derrick Rose Night halftime ceremony 🌹 pic.twitter.com/uBLp92TBKk \"He's probably the most beloved player in the league by everybody,\" Thibodeau said. \"We're thrilled that he's being honored.I always say the true measure of a man is how he handles adversity. And nobody did it better. He never stayed down. He always found a way to rise above and I'm thrilled for him, for the career he had. I think he's Hall of Fame. There's no question in my mind he's a Hall of Fame player.\" During the halftime celebration, Rose spoke to the fans for nearly three minutes. He reflected on the expectations that followed him since he was in sixth grade, and called out the many highs and lows of his career before once again honoring his hometown. \"Thank you, Chicago,\" he said. \"For forcing me to be great.\" © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

                "content": "Derrick Rose opened up about how his career might have turned out had he not been injury-prone. Rose is one of the NBA's biggest \"what ifs,\" as he became the youngest NBA MVP in league history and was named an All-Star three times before injuries. During a press conference on Saturday, D-Rose looked back on his career path, acknowledging that despite the setbacks, the experience led him to a greater sense of self-awareness and personal growth. However, given his fierce competitive nature, Rose expressed that if he had won a championship with the Bulls, it wouldn't have been just one title.

Rose added that as a Chicago native, he learned to be resilient and to make the most of the challenges he faced. While Derrick Rose was never able to reach the heights he dreamed of, fans and people in the NBA acknowledge the contributions he has made to the league. The Chicago Bulls announced they would retire Rose's jersey number next season. The organization made the announcement in front of Rose himself. A video of the former star guard went viral on X as D-Rose found himself in tears after the Bulls’ front office told him the news. Derrick Rose was selected by the Bulls as the No. 1 pick in the 2008 NBA draft. He quickly proved why he was the deserving top pick, winning the 2009 NBA Rookie of the Year award by averaging 16.8 points, 6.3 assists and 3.9 rebounds. In his sophomore year, Rose was named an All-Star, averaging 20.8 ppg, 6.0 apg and 3.8 rpg. Then, at the age of 22, in his third season with the Bulls, Rose was named the MVP, becoming the youngest player to win the prestigious award. Unfortunately for Derrick Rose, his fourth year with the Chicago Bulls marked his last All-Star season, as it was the beginning of his injury-prone era. Since then, Rose was never able to play at the same level and slowly became a shell of his former self. Nevertheless, his short-lived superstardom will forever be remembered by the league and fans, hence his upcoming jersey retirement next season. Chicago Bulls Fan?

                "content": "National Football League (1970–present) The Kansas City Chiefs are a professional American football team based in Kansas City, Missouri. The Chiefs compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) West division. The Chiefs started playing in 1959 as the Dallas Texans by businessman Lamar Hunt and was a charter member of the American Football League (AFL).[12] In 1963, the team moved to Kansas City,[13][14] and kept its current name.[15][16] The Chiefs joined the NFL as a result of the 1970 AFL–NFL merger; entering the 2024 season, the team is valued at over US$4.85 billion. After Hunt's death in 2006, his wife, Norma, and children became legal owners of the team. After Norma's death in 2023, the Hunt children inherited her stake in the franchise. Clark Hunt, one of the Hunts' children, has served as chairman and CEO since 2006 and is the ultimate authority over personnel decisions. He is also the team representative at league owner meetings. The Chiefs were victorious and won three AFL championships, in 1962, 1966, and 1969,[17][18] and were the second AFL team (after the New York Jets) to defeat an NFL team in a Super Bowl when they defeated the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl IV, which was the final game before the league merger went into full effect. The Chiefs were also the second team, after the Green Bay Packers (whom they played in Super Bowl I), to appear in more than one Super Bowl (and the first AFL team to do so) and the first to appear in the championship game in two different decades. Despite this post-season success, the team failed to find success in the playoffs for decades, including losing ten of eleven playoff games from 1993 to 2018, which included an eight-game losing streak. Since then, the Chiefs have risen to dynastic performance under head coach Andy Reid, quarterback Patrick Mahomes, tight end Travis Kelce, and defensive tackle Chris Jones, appearing in four Super Bowls since 2019 and being victorious in three: LIV, LVII, and LVIII.[19][20][21] In 1959, Lamar Hunt began discussions with other businessmen to establish a professional football league that would rival the National Football League.[17][22][23] Hunt's desire to secure a football team was heightened after watching the 1958 NFL Championship Game between the New York Giants and Baltimore Colts.[22][24] After unsuccessful attempts to purchase and relocate the NFL's Chicago Cardinals to his hometown of Dallas, Texas,[17][25] Hunt went to the NFL and asked to create an expansion franchise in Dallas. The NFL turned him down, so Hunt then established the American Football League and started his own team, the Dallas Texans, to begin play in 1960. Hunt hired a little-known assistant coach from the University of Miami football team, Hank Stram, to be the team's head coach[22] after the job offer was declined by Bud Wilkinson and Tom Landry.[22] After Stram was hired, Don Klosterman was hired as head scout, and was credited by many for bringing a wealth of talent to the Texans after luring it away from the NFL, often hiding players and using creative means to land them. The Texans shared the Cotton Bowl with the NFL's Dallas Cowboys for three seasons. The Texans were to have exclusive access to the stadium until the NFL put an expansion team, the Dallas Cowboys, there.[22] While the team averaged a league-best 24,500 at the Cotton Bowl, the Texans gained less attention due to the AFL's relatively lower profile compared to the NFL's.[22] In the franchise's first two seasons, the team managed only an 8–6 and 6–8 record, respectively.[26] In their third season, the Texans tallied an 11–3 record and a berth in the team's first American Football League Championship Game, against the Houston Oilers.[25][26] The game was broadcast nationally on ABC and the Texans defeated the Oilers 20–17 in double overtime.[25] The game lasted 77 minutes and 54 seconds, which, at the time, was the longest game in the history of professional American Football. It is still the longest championship game in American Football League history.[25] It turned out to be the last game the team would play as the Dallas Texans. Despite competing against a Cowboys team that managed only a 9–28–3 record in their first three seasons, Hunt decided that the Dallas–Fort Worth media market just couldn't sustain two professional football franchises.[25][27] He considered moving the Texans to either Atlanta or Miami for the 1963 season.[25] He was ultimately swayed by an offer from Kansas City Mayor Harold Roe Bartle.[25][27][28] Bartle promised to triple the franchise's season ticket sales and expand the seating capacity of Municipal Stadium to accommodate the team.[25][27][28] Hunt agreed to relocate the franchise to Kansas City on May 22, 1963,[13][14] and on May 26, the team was renamed the Kansas City Chiefs.[15][25][27][28] Hunt and head coach Hank Stram initially planned to retain the Texans name, but a fan contest determined the new \"Chiefs\" name in honor of Mayor Bartle's nickname that he acquired in his professional role as Scout Executive of the St. Joseph and Kansas City Boy Scout Councils, and founder of the Scouting Society, the Tribe of Mic-O-Say.[25][28] Despite the historical use of Native American features, it has been acknowledged that the team's naming was not a direct reference to Native Americans but only to Bartle's nickname \"Chief\".[29][30] Business Insider journalist Meredith Cash even stated in January 2020 that Bartle \"insisted on the team being named after himself\" and that \"Bartle was known as Chief Lone Bear within Mic-O-Say circles, and eventually the nickname \"Chief\" caught on among people throughout Kansas City.\"[31] The franchise became one of the strongest teams in the now thriving American Football League,[17] with the most playoff appearances for an AFL team (tied with the Oakland Raiders), and the most AFL Championships (three).[25] The team's dominance helped Lamar Hunt become a central figure in negotiations with NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle to agree on an AFL–NFL merger.[25][32] In the meetings between the two leagues, a merged league championship game was agreed to be played in January 1967 following the conclusion of the leagues' respective 1966 seasons. Hunt insisted on calling the game the \"Super Bowl\" after seeing his children playing with a popular toy at the time, a Super Ball.[25][32][33] While the first few games were designated the \"AFL–NFL World Championship Game\", the Super Bowl name became its officially licensed title in years to come.[34] The Chiefs cruised to an 11–2–1 record in 1966, and defeated the defending AFL Champion Buffalo Bills in the AFL Championship Game.[35] The Chiefs were invited to play the NFL's league champion Green Bay Packers in the first AFL–NFL World Championship Game. Kansas City and Green Bay played a close game for the first half, but Green Bay took control in the final two quarters, winning the game by a score of 35–10.[36] The Chiefs lost the game but gained the respect of several Packers opponents following the game.[37] The Chiefs' inter-league match-up with the Packers was not the last time that they would face an NFL opponent, especially on the championship stage.[25] The following August, Kansas City hosted the NFL's Chicago Bears in the 1967 preseason and won the game 66–24.[25] Despite losing to the division rival Oakland Raiders twice in the regular season in 1969, the two teams met for a third time in the AFL Championship Game, where Kansas City won 17–7.[26] Backup quarterback Mike Livingston led the team in a six-game winning streak after Len Dawson suffered a leg injury which kept him out of most of the season's games.[25] While getting plenty of help from the club's defense, Dawson returned from the injury and led the Chiefs to Super Bowl IV.[25] Against the NFL champion Minnesota Vikings,[17] who were favored by 12+1⁄2, the Chiefs dominated the game 23–7 to claim the team's first Super Bowl championship.[25] Dawson was named the game's Most Valuable Player after completing 12-of-17 passes for 142 yards and one touchdown, with 1 interception.[38] The following season, the Chiefs and the rest of the American Football League merged with the National Football League after the AFL–NFL merger became official.[25] The Chiefs were placed in the American Football Conference's West Division.[26] From 1960 to 1969, the Chiefs/Texans won 87 games, which is the most in the ten-year history of the AFL.[39] In 1970, the Chiefs went 7–5–2 and missed the playoffs.[40] The following season, the Chiefs tallied a 10–3–1 record and won the AFC West Division.[41] Head coach Hank Stram considered his 1971 Chiefs team as his best, but they failed to capture their championship dominance from 1969.[41] Most of the pieces of the team which won Super Bowl IV two years earlier were still in place for the 1971 season.[41] The Chiefs tied with the Miami Dolphins for the best record in the AFC, and both teams met in a Christmas Day playoff game which the Chiefs lost 27–24 in double overtime.[41] The Dolphins outlasted the Chiefs with a 37-yard field goal.[41] The game surpassed the 1962 AFL Championship Game as the longest ever at 82 minutes and 40 seconds.[41] The game was also the final football game at Kansas City's Municipal Stadium.[41] In 1972, the Chiefs moved into the newly constructed Arrowhead Stadium at the Truman Sports Complex outside of downtown Kansas City.[41] The team's first game at Arrowhead was against the St. Louis Cardinals, a preseason game that the Chiefs won 24–14.[41] Linebacker Willie Lanier and quarterback Len Dawson won the NFL Man of the Year Award in 1972 and 1973, respectively.[42] The Chiefs did not return to the post-season for the remainder of the 1970s, and the 1973 season was the team's last winning season for seven years.[41] Hank Stram was fired following a 5–9 season in 1974, and many of the Chiefs' future Hall of Fame players departed by the middle of the decade.[41] From 1975 to 1988, the Chiefs had become a team that rarely won, which provided Chiefs fans with nothing but futility.[43][44] Five head coaches struggled to achieve the same success as Stram, compiling an 81–121–1 record.[43] In 1980, Coach Marv Levy cut future Hall of Fame Kicker Jan Stenerud for little-known Nick Lowery, who would become the most accurate kicker in NFL history over the next fourteen years. In 1981, running back Joe Delaney rushed for 1,121 yards and was named the AFC Rookie of the Year.[45] The Chiefs finished the season with a 9–7 record and entered the 1982 season with optimism.[45] The NFL Players Association strike curbed the Chiefs' chances of returning to the postseason for the first time in over a decade.[45] The Chiefs tallied a 3–6 record[26] and in the off-season, Joe Delaney died while trying to save several children from drowning in a pond near his home in Louisiana.[46] The Chiefs drafted quarterback Todd Blackledge over future greats such as Jim Kelly and Dan Marino in the 1983 NFL draft.[47][48] Blackledge never started a full season for Kansas City while Kelly and Marino played Hall of Fame careers.[48] While the Chiefs struggled on offense in the 1980s, they had a strong defensive unit consisting of Pro Bowlers such as Bill Maas, Albert Lewis, Art Still and Deron Cherry.[45] John Mackovic took over head coaching duties for the 1983 season after Marv Levy was fired.[45] Over the next four seasons, Mackovic coached the Chiefs to a 30–34 record, but took the team to its first postseason appearance in 15 years in the 1986 NFL playoffs.[26] They lost to the New York Jets in the wild-card round.[45] Despite leading the Chiefs to only their third winning season and second playoff appearance since the merger, Mackovic was fired for what Hunt described as a lack of chemistry.[49] Frank Gansz served as head coach for the next two seasons, but won only eight of 31 games.[50][51] On December 19, 1988, owner Lamar Hunt hired Carl Peterson as the team's new president, general manager, and chief executive officer. Peterson fired head coach Frank Gansz two weeks after taking over and hired Marty Schottenheimer as the club's seventh head coach.[45] In the 1988 and 1989 NFL Drafts, the Chiefs selected both defensive end Neil Smith and linebacker Derrick Thomas, respectively.[45][53] The defense that Thomas and Smith anchored in their seven seasons together was a big reason why the Chiefs reached the postseason in six straight years.[54] In Schottenheimer's ten-season tenure as head coach, the Chiefs became a perennial playoff contender, featuring offensive players including Steve DeBerg, Christian Okoye, Stephone Paige and Barry Word, a strong defense, anchored by Thomas, Smith, Albert Lewis and Deron Cherry, and on special teams, Nick Lowery, who was then the most accurate kicker in NFL History.[17] The team recorded a 101–58–1 record, and clinched seven playoff berths.[55] The Chiefs' 1993 season was the franchise's most successful in 22 years.[53] With newly acquired quarterback Joe Montana and running back Marcus Allen, two former Super Bowl champions and Most Valuable Player Award winners, the Chiefs further strengthened their position in the NFL.[53] The 11–5 Chiefs defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers and Houston Oilers on their way to the franchise's first AFC Championship Game appearance against the Buffalo Bills.[53] The Chiefs were overwhelmed by the Bills and lost the game by a score of 30–13.[53] The Chiefs' victory on January 16, 1994, against the Oilers remained the franchise's last post-season victory for 22 years until their 30–0 victory over the Houston Texans on January 9, 2016.[56] In the 1995 NFL playoffs, the 13–3 Chiefs hosted the Indianapolis Colts in a cold, damp late afternoon game at Arrowhead Stadium.[26][53] Kansas City lost the game 10–7 against the underdog Colts, after kicker Lin Elliot missed three field-goal attempts and quarterback Steve Bono threw three interceptions.[53] The Chiefs selected tight end Tony Gonzalez with the 13th overall selection in the 1997 NFL draft, a move which some considered to be a gamble being that Gonzalez was primarily a basketball player at California. During a 1997 season full of injuries to starting quarterback Elvis Grbac, backup quarterback Rich Gannon took the reins of the Chiefs' offense as the team headed to another 13–3 season.[26][53] Head coach Marty Schottenheimer chose Grbac to start the playoff game against the Denver Broncos despite Gannon's successes in previous weeks.[53] Grbac's production in the game was lacking, and the Chiefs lost to the Broncos 14–10.[53] Denver went on to capture their fifth AFC Championship by defeating Pittsburgh, and then defeated the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XXXII. Coach Schottenheimer announced his resignation from the Chiefs following the 1998 season.[57] Following Schottenheimer's resignation, defensive coordinator Gunther Cunningham took over coaching duties for the next two seasons, compiling a 16–16 record.[53] By the end of the Chiefs' decade of regular-season dominance, Gannon had signed with the Oakland Raiders, Neil Smith signed with the Denver Broncos, and Derrick Thomas was paralyzed in a car accident on January 23, 2000.[53] Thomas died from complications of his injury weeks later.[53] After allegedly reading online that he would be relieved of duties, head coach Gunther Cunningham was fired.[58][59] Looking to change the Chiefs' game plan which relied on a tough defensive strategy for the past decade, Carl Peterson contacted Dick Vermeil about the Chiefs' head coaching vacancy for the 2001 season.[58] Vermeil previously led the St. Louis Rams to a victory in Super Bowl XXXIV.[59] Vermeil was hired on January 12.[60] The Chiefs then traded a first-round draft pick in the 2001 NFL draft to St. Louis for quarterback Trent Green and signed free agent running back Priest Holmes to be the team's cornerstones on offense.[61][62] In Vermeil's first season with the Chiefs, he led the team to a 6–10 record.[63] The team improved to a 8–8 record in 2002 but still missed the postseason.[64] In 2003, Kansas City began the season with nine consecutive victories, a franchise record.[65] They finished the season with a 13–3 record and the team's offense led the NFL in several categories under the direction of USA Today's Offensive Coach of the Year honoree, Al Saunders.[59] Running back Priest Holmes surpassed Marshall Faulk's single-season touchdown record by scoring his 27th rushing touchdown against the Chicago Bears in the team's regular-season finale.[59][66] The team clinched the second seed in the 2003 NFL playoffs and hosted the Indianapolis Colts in the AFC Divisional Playoffs.[67] In a game where neither team punted, the Chiefs lost the shoot-out 38–31.[68] It was the third time in nine seasons that the Chiefs went 8–0 at home in the regular season, only to lose their post-season opener at Arrowhead. After a disappointing 7–9 record in 2004, the 2005 Chiefs finished with a 10–6 record but no playoff berth.[69][70] They were the fourth team since 1990 to miss the playoffs with a 10–6 record.[59] Running back Larry Johnson started in place of the injured Priest Holmes and rushed for 1,750 yards in only nine starts.[71] Prior to the Chiefs' final game of the season, head coach Dick Vermeil announced his retirement.[72] The Chiefs won the game 37–3 over the playoff-bound Cincinnati Bengals.[73] Within two weeks of Vermeil's retirement, the Chiefs returned to their defensive roots with the selection of its next head coach.[59] The team introduced Herm Edwards, a former Chiefs scout and head coach of the New York Jets, as the team's tenth head coach after trading a fourth-round selection in the 2006 NFL draft to the Jets.[74] Quarterback Trent Green suffered a severe concussion in the team's season opener to the Cincinnati Bengals which left him out of play for eight weeks.[75] Backup quarterback Damon Huard took over in Green's absence and led the Chiefs to a 5–3 record.[76] Kansas City was awarded a Thanksgiving Day game against the Denver Broncos in response to owner Lamar Hunt's lobbying for a third Thanksgiving Day game.[59] The Chiefs defeated the Broncos 19–10 in the first Thanksgiving Day game in Kansas City since 1969.[59] Hunt was hospitalized at the time of the game and died weeks later on December 13 due to complications of prostate cancer.[32][59] The Chiefs honored their owner for the remainder of the season, as did the rest of the league.[59] Trent Green returned in the middle of the season, but struggled in the final stretch,[59] and running back Larry Johnson set an NFL record with 416 carries in a season.[77] Kansas City managed to clinch their first playoff berth in three seasons with a 9–7 record and a bizarre sequence of six losses from other AFC teams on New Year's Eve, culminating with a Broncos loss to the 49ers.[59] The Indianapolis Colts hosted the Chiefs in the Wild Card playoffs and defeated Kansas City 23–8.[78] In 2007, Trent Green was traded to the Miami Dolphins[79] leaving the door open for either Damon Huard or Brodie Croyle to become the new starting quarterback.[59] After starting the season with a 4–3 record, the Chiefs lost the remaining nine games when running back Larry Johnson suffered a season-ending foot injury and the quarterback position lacked stability with Huard and Croyle.[59] Despite the team's 4–12 record, tight end Tony Gonzalez broke Shannon Sharpe's NFL record for touchdowns at the position (63) and defensive end Jared Allen led the NFL in quarterback sacks with 15.5.[80][81] The Chiefs began their 2008 season with the youngest team in the NFL.[82] The starting lineup had an average of 25.5 years of age.[82] By releasing several veteran players such as cornerback Ty Law and wide receiver Eddie Kennison and trading defensive end Jared Allen,[83] the Chiefs began a youth movement.[82][84] The Chiefs had a league-high thirteen selections in the 2008 NFL draft and chose defensive tackle Glenn Dorsey and offensive lineman Branden Albert in the first round. Analysts quickly called Kansas City's selections as the best of the entire draft.[83][85][86][87] Entering the season, the Chiefs were unsure if injury-prone quarterback Brodie Croyle, who was the incumbent starter, could be their quarterback in the long-term.[87] Croyle was injured in the team's first game of the season and Damon Huard started in Croyle's absence.[88] Tyler Thigpen become the third Chiefs starting quarterback in as many games for a start against the Atlanta Falcons.[89][90] After a poor performance by Thigpen, in which he threw three interceptions against the Falcons defense,[90] Huard was retained as the starting quarterback.[91] The Chiefs struggled off the field as much as on as tight end Tony Gonzalez demanded a trade and running back Larry Johnson was involved in legal trouble.[92][93][94][95] Croyle returned for the Chiefs' game against the Tennessee Titans, but both he and Damon Huard suffered season-ending injuries in the game.[96] The Chiefs reorganized their offense to a new spread offense game plan focused around Tyler Thigpen.[84][88][97][98] The Chiefs' new offense was implemented to help Thigpen play to the best of his abilities and also following the absence of Larry Johnson, who was suspended for his off-field conduct.[93][97][98][99] The Chiefs made a huge gamble by using the spread offense, as most in the NFL believe that it cannot work in professional football, and also head coach Herm Edwards was traditionally in favor of more conservative, run-oriented game plans.[98] The 2008 season ended with a franchise worst 2–14 record, where the team suffered historic blowout defeats nearly week-in and week-out,[26][90][100] a 34–0 shut-out to the Carolina Panthers,[101] and allowed a franchise-high 54 points against the Buffalo Bills.[102] The team's general manager, chief executive officer, and team president Carl Peterson resigned at the end of the season,[103] and former New England Patriots vice president of player personnel Scott Pioli was hired as his replacement for 2009.[104] On January 23, 2009, Herm Edwards was fired as head coach,[105][106] and two weeks later Todd Haley signed a four-year contract to become Edwards' successor.[107][108] Haley had a background with Pioli, which made him an attractive hire for Pioli's first coach in Kansas City. In April 2009, Tony Gonzalez was traded to the Atlanta Falcons after failed trade attempts over the previous two seasons.[109] Notably, head coach Todd Haley fired offensive coordinator Chan Gailey just weeks before the start of the 2009 season and chose to take on the coordinator duties himself. Throughout 2009 the Chiefs acquired veterans to supplement the Chiefs' young talent including Matt Cassel, Mike Vrabel, Bobby Engram, Mike Brown, Chris Chambers, and Andy Alleman.[110][111][112] The team finished with a 4–12 record, just a two-game improvement upon their record from the 2008 season. For the 2010 season, the Chiefs made significant hires for their coaching staff, bringing on former Patriots assistant coaches Charlie Weis and Romeo Crennel to coach the offense and defense, respectively.[113] The coaching additions proved to be very successful, as the Chiefs would go on to secure their first AFC West title since 2003. Their ten victories in the 2010 season combined for as many as the team had won in their previous three seasons combined.[114] On January 9, 2011, the Chiefs lost their home Wild Card playoff game to the Baltimore Ravens 30–7.[115] Six players were chosen for the Pro Bowl: Dwayne Bowe, Jamaal Charles, Brian Waters, Tamba Hali, Matt Cassel, and rookie safety Eric Berry. Jamaal Charles won the FEDEX ground player of the year award and Dwayne Bowe led the NFL in touchdown receptions.[116] For their first pick in the 2011 NFL draft, the team selected Jon Baldwin.[117] After a poor start, Haley was relieved of duties as head coach on December 12. Clark Hunt made note of \"bright spots at different points this season,\" but felt that overall the Chiefs were not progressing.[118] The highest point of the 2011 season was an upset win against the Packers, who at that time, were undefeated with a 13–0 record.[119] Defensive coordinator Romeo Crennel would be named the team's interim head coach for the remaining three games of the season, including the aforementioned Packers game.[120] On January 9, 2012, Crennel was named the 11th full-time head coach in Chiefs history.[121] The 2012 Chiefs became the first team since the 1929 Buffalo Bisons to not lead in regulation through any of their first nine games.[122] The Chiefs tied their franchise-worst record of 2–14 and clinched the No. 1 overall pick in the 2013 NFL draft.[123] It is the first time since the merger they have held the first overall pick.[124] Following the 2012 season, the Chiefs fired head coach Romeo Crennel and general manager Scott Pioli.[125][126] Former Philadelphia Eagles head coach Andy Reid was brought in as head coach to work with new general manager John Dorsey, a former Green Bay Packers head scout.[127][128] The Chiefs acquired quarterback Alex Smith from the San Francisco 49ers for the Chiefs' second-round pick, 34th overall, in the 2013 draft and a conditional pick in the 2014 draft.[129] Matt Cassel was released shortly after.[130] The Chiefs selected Eric Fisher with the first overall pick of the 2013 NFL draft.[131] In 2013, the Chiefs started 9–0 for the second time in team history.[132] The team finished with a 11–5 record and made the playoffs.[133] They led in their wildcard game against the Indianapolis Colts 38–10 shortly after halftime, but collapsed late and lost 45–44.[134] In 2014, the Chiefs attempted to make the playoffs for the second straight season for the first time since 1995, finishing 9–7 and getting eliminated in Week 17.[135] After a promising win for the Chiefs against Houston in Week 1, Kansas City went on a five-game losing streak culminating in a 16–10 loss to Minnesota and the loss of Jamaal Charles to a torn ACL.[136] They made one of the most improbable season comebacks in the NFL and won ten straight to improve their record from 1–5 to 11–5. The team clinched a playoff berth after a 17–13 win over Cleveland in Week 16 to become only the second post-merger NFL team to make the playoffs following a 1–5 start.[137] The streak achieved by the Chiefs broke a franchise record for nine straight (2003, 2013) and second nine plus game win streak under Reid. After a Week 17 win over Oakland 23–17, the Chiefs achieved their longest winning streak in franchise history at ten games. They qualified for the playoffs, playing in the 2015 AFC Wild-Card playoff game, held at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas on January 9, 2016. The Chiefs defeated the Houston Texans 30–0 to earn their first NFL playoff win in 23 seasons, dating back to the 1993–94 NFL playoffs, a win that also came in Houston. The Chiefs' Wild-Card playoff victory ended what was at the time the third-longest drought in the NFL, and it also ended a then NFL record eight-game playoff losing streak.[138] Riddled with injuries, they were defeated by the New England Patriots 27–20 in the AFC Divisional Round.[139] The Chiefs first game of the 2016 season was against their division rival, the San Diego Chargers. After facing a 24–3 deficit with six minutes left in the 3rd quarter, the Chiefs engineered a 33–27 comeback win ending with a two-yard touchdown run by Alex Smith in overtime to give the Chiefs their largest regular season comeback to start the season at 1–0.[140] On Christmas Day, the Chiefs defeated the Denver Broncos 33–10 to give Kansas City their tenth straight win against divisional opponents. On January 1, 2017, the Chiefs clinched the AFC West and the second seed going into the playoffs that year, where they fell to the Pittsburgh Steelers 18–16 in the divisional round as Chris Boswell hit six field goals.[141] The Chiefs finished the 2017 season with a 10–6 record, and won the AFC West.[142] This was the first time in Chiefs history that they won the AFC West in back-to-back years.[143] In the Wild Card round, the Chiefs lost a tight game to the Tennessee Titans 22–21, allowing Derrick Henry to rush for 156 yards. The loss extended their NFL record for most consecutive home playoff losses to six.[144] The game marked the end of Alex Smith's five-year tenure with the Chiefs, as he was traded to the Washington Redskins a few weeks later.[145] Patrick Mahomes made his NFL debut and first career start in the December 31, 2017, game against the Denver Broncos. The Chiefs won the game 27–24, with Mahomes going 22 for 35 with 284 yards and one interception.[146] The Chiefs began the 2018 season with first-year starter Mahomes as their quarterback and finished the regular season with a record of 12–4, clinching the AFC West for the third year in a row and the AFC's top seed. This included victories over division rivals Los Angeles Chargers, Oakland Raiders and Denver Broncos (twice), along with important conference victories over the Pittsburgh Steelers, Cincinnati Bengals, and Jacksonville Jaguars. Their first loss of the season came at the hands of the New England Patriots with a last-second field goal.[147] Their second loss of the season came against the Los Angeles Rams with a final score of 51–54, in which the Kansas City Chiefs made history by becoming the first NFL team to lose a game after scoring more than 50 points.[148] Mahomes finished the season with 5,097 yards and 50 touchdowns, both team records.[149] He became the 11th quarterback to throw for 5,000 yards and the third to throw for 50 touchdowns.[150] He joined Peyton Manning as only the 2nd player in NFL history to throw for 5,000 yards and 50 touchdowns.[151] For his performance during the season, he was named AP NFL MVP, the first Chief to ever win the award.[152] In the AFC Divisional round on January 12, 2019, the Chiefs defeated the Indianapolis Colts 31–13 to move on to the AFC Championship Game.[153] This marked the Chiefs' first playoff win in Arrowhead Stadium in 25 years.[154] This also enabled the Chiefs to host the AFC Championship Game for the first time ever.[155] The next week, Kansas City's bid for its first Super Bowl berth in 49 years ended with a 37–31 overtime loss to the New England Patriots.[156] The Chiefs finished the 2019 regular season with a 12–4 record, winning the AFC West division title for the fourth straight year, and clinched the AFC's second seed behind the Baltimore Ravens.[157] The Chiefs defeated the Houston Texans 51–31 in the AFC Divisional Game after falling behind 24–0 at the start of the second quarter with Mahomes throwing for five touchdowns.[158] The Chiefs hosted their second AFC Championship game in consecutive years facing the sixth-seed Tennessee Titans. The Chiefs then defeated the Titans 35–24 and advanced to Super Bowl LIV.[159] This marked their first Super Bowl appearance in 50 years, since Super Bowl IV.[160] On February 2, 2020, in Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, the Chiefs played against the NFC's top seed, the San Francisco 49ers. Following halftime when both teams were tied at ten points, Mahomes threw 2 interceptions in back to back drives in the 3rd and 4th quarters, resulting in the 49ers having a 20–10 lead with under 12 minutes remaining in the game. Sparked by a 44-yard completion to Tyreek Hill on 3rd and 15, the Chiefs scored touchdowns on their next two possessions, with Mahomes throwing touchdowns to Travis Kelce and Damien Williams.[161] With a 24–20 lead with under two minutes remaining, Williams had a 38-yard touchdown run to effectively seal the game for the Chiefs. This marked the first time in NFL postseason history that a team faced ten point deficits in three straight games and won all three by double-digit margins. Mahomes won the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award, ending the Chiefs' Super Bowl drought dating back to the AFL-NFL Merger.[162] On July 6, 2020, Mahomes signed a record ten–year, $503 million contract extension keeping him under contract until the conclusion of the 2031 season. The contract is the largest ever signed in North American sports, more than tripling the value of the previous largest contract signed (although said contract was for a shorter 5 years, signed by Matt Ryan of the Atlanta Falcons).[163] With their week 14 victory over the Miami Dolphins, the Chiefs clinched their fifth consecutive division title. The victory also gave the Chiefs their first 12–1 record in franchise history. They would later win 14 games for the first time in franchise history. In the playoffs they defeated the Cleveland Browns and Buffalo Bills to win the AFC Championship for the second consecutive year.[164][165] The Chiefs would face the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Super Bowl LV at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, ultimately losing 9–31, failing to score a touchdown in the game.[166] In their 2021 season, the Chiefs beat the Pittsburgh Steelers 36–10, earning the team's sixth straight AFC West title on December 26, 2021.[167] The Chiefs began their playoff slate with a win against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the Wild Card round, and advanced to play the Buffalo Bills in the divisional round. Their 42–36 victory over Buffalo came in a game sports commentators and analysts dubbed as one of the greatest modern day NFL playoff games.[168][169][170][171][172][173] Despite being the first team to host the AFC Championship game for four consecutive seasons, the team finished the season losing 24–27 in overtime to the Cincinnati Bengals. The Chiefs began their 2022 season by trading Tyreek Hill to the Miami Dolphins,[174] and instead opting to stock up on picks in the 2022 NFL draft. They finished the season with a 14–3 regular season record, with losses coming from the Colts, Bills, and Bengals. All three losses were by margins of less than four points. The Chiefs won their seventh consecutive AFC West division championship, and secured the #1 seed in the AFC playoffs.[175] The team hosted their fifth consecutive AFC Championship Game,[176] and second consecutive against the Cincinnati Bengals, winning 23–20 on a game-winning field goal from Harrison Butker.[177] In Super Bowl LVII, the Chiefs defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 38–35 again on a field goal from Butker.[178] With the victory, Mahomes became the first player since Kurt Warner in 1999 to win both the NFL MVP Award and Super Bowl MVP Award in the same season.[179] Head coach Andy Reid won his second Super Bowl championship over the Eagles, the team he had previously led to a Super Bowl appearance.[180] Entering the 2023 season as defending champions, the Chiefs failed to improve on their 14–3 record from the previous season, despite this they secured their eleventh consecutive winning season and became division champions for the eighth consecutive season.[181][182][183] Their overall record was 11–6, their least successful record under quarterback Patrick Mahomes. In the playoffs, the Chiefs defeated the Miami Dolphins 26–7 in the wildcard round in frigid weather. In the divisional round, the team held on to a narrow 27–24 win over the Buffalo Bills on the road. This was the Chiefs third playoff win in four years over the Bills. They made their sixth consecutive AFC Championship Game appearance, but their first on the road, defeating the Baltimore Ravens 17–10 to advance to their fourth Super Bowl in five years. In a rematch of Super Bowl LIV, the Chiefs overtime defeat of the San Francisco 49ers 25–22 in Super Bowl LVIII moved the franchise to four Super Bowl titles, becoming the seventh franchise to accomplish that number. This was only the second overtime game in Super Bowl history.[184] This marked the first back-to-back Super Bowl wins since Super Bowl XXXIX, making it three Super Bowl wins in five years and cementing them as a dynasty.[185][186] The Chiefs have won four Super Bowl Championships and three AFL Championships – the latter of which were won twice as the Kansas City Chiefs and once under their original name, the Dallas Texans.[187][188] When the Texans began playing in 1960, the team's logo consisted of the state of Texas in white with a yellow star marking the location of the city of Dallas. Originally, Hunt chose Columbia blue and orange for the Texans' uniforms, but Bud Adams chose Columbia blue and scarlet for his Houston Oilers franchise.[5] Hunt reverted to red and gold for the Texans' uniforms, which even after the team relocated to Kansas City, remain as the franchise's colors to this day.[5] The state of Texas on the team's helmet was replaced by an arrowhead design originally sketched by Lamar Hunt on a napkin.[5] Hunt's inspiration for the interlocking \"KC\" design was the \"SF\" inside of an oval on the San Francisco 49ers helmets.[5] Unlike the 49ers' logo, Kansas City's overlapping initials appear inside a white arrowhead instead of an oval and are surrounded by a thin black outline.[5] From 1960 to 1973, the Chiefs had grey facemask bars on their helmets, but changed to white facemasks in 1974, making them one of the first teams (alongside the San Diego Chargers, who introduced a yellow facemask that same year) in the NFL to use a non-gray facemask.[5] The Chiefs' uniform design has essentially remained the same throughout the club's history with only four minor changes occurring.[5] It consists of a red helmet, and either red or white jerseys with the opposite color numbers and names.[5] White pants were used with both jerseys from 1960 to 1967, and 1989 to 1999.[5] Beginning in 2009, during the Pioli/Haley era, the team has alternated between white and red pants for road games during the season. Prior to September 15, 2013, the Chiefs always wore white pants with their red jerseys. The Chiefs do not have an official alternate jersey, although unofficial alternate jerseys are sold for retail. The Chiefs wore their white jerseys with white pants at home for the 2006 season opener against the Cincinnati Bengals. The logic behind the uniform selection that day was that the Bengals would have to wear their black uniform on a day when hot temperatures were forecast.[189] In 2007, the Kansas City Chiefs honored Lamar Hunt and the AFL with a special patch.[190] It features the AFL's logo from the 1960s with Hunt's \"LH\" initials inside the football.[190] In 2008, the patch became permanently affixed to the left chest of both Kansas City's home and away jerseys.[190] In select games for the 2009 season, the Chiefs, as well as the other founding teams of the American Football League, wore a \"throwback\" uniform to celebrate the AFL's 50th anniversary.[191] For the first time in team history, the Chiefs wore red jerseys with red pants, forming an all-red combo in their home opener against the Dallas Cowboys on September 15, 2013.[192] The all-red uniform is now an official uniform combination and has been used multiple times since. It is commonly used for prime-time games at home. The all-red look also served as the basis for the Chiefs' Color Rush design. Arrowhead Stadium has been the Chiefs' home field since 1972 and has a capacity of 76,416,[193] which makes it the fifth-largest stadium in the NFL. The stadium underwent a $375 million renovation, completed in mid-2010, which included new luxury boxes, wider concourses and enhanced amenities.[194][104] The stadium renovation was paid for by $250 million in taxpayer money and $125 million from the Hunt Family.[108] The stadium cost $53 million to build in 1972, and an average ticket in 2009 costs $81.[194] Aramark serves as the stadium's concession provider and T-Mobile, Anheuser-Busch and Coca-Cola are major corporate sponsors.[194] Dating back to the Chiefs' home opener in 1991 to mid-2009, the Chiefs had 155 consecutive sellout games.[194] The streak ended with the final home game of the 2009 season against the Cleveland Browns, resulting in the first local TV blackout in over 19 years.[195] Arrowhead has been called one of the world's finest stadiums[17] and has long held a reputation for being one of the toughest and loudest outdoor stadiums for opposing players to play in.[104][196][197][198] All noise is directly attributed to its fans[199] and was once measured at 116 decibels by the Acoustical Design Group of Mission, Kansas.[200] By way of comparison, take-off of aircraft may lead to a sound level of 106 decibels at the ground.[200] Sports Illustrated named Arrowhead Stadium the \"toughest place to play\" for opposing teams in 2005.[201] The tailgate party environment outside the stadium on gameday has been compared to a \"college football\" atmosphere.[202] Arrowhead Stadium features frequent fly-overs from a B-2 Spirit stealth bomber from nearby Whiteman Air Force Base. Since the 1994 NFL season, the stadium has had a natural grass playing surface.[203] From 1972 to 1993, the stadium had an artificial AstroTurf surface.[203] During the game against the Oakland Raiders on October 13, 2013, Arrowhead Stadium once again became the loudest stadium in the world when the fans set the Guinness Book of World Records record for loudest crowd in an outdoor stadium (137.5 dB), breaking the record set by the Seattle Seahawks just four weeks prior. A few weeks after, Seattle re-gained the record by reaching a noise level of 137.6 decibels.[204][205] Chiefs fans have reclaimed the record once again on September 29, 2014, on ESPN's Monday Night Football against the New England Patriots, the fans recorded a sound reading of 142.2 decibels.[206] The stadium has been officially named GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium (pronounced G.E.H.A.) since 2021. The stadium was renamed after GEHA signed a naming rights deal with the Chiefs.[207] When the franchise was based in Dallas, the team conducted their inaugural training camp at the New Mexico Military Institute in Roswell, New Mexico.[25] They moved camp to Southern Methodist University, owner Lamar Hunt's alma mater, for 1961 and continued to practice there until 1965.[25] From 1966 to 1971, the Chiefs practiced in Swope Park in Kansas City,[208] and from 1972 to 1991 held camp at William Jewell College in Clay County, Missouri–where Lamar Hunt had extensive business dealings including Worlds of Fun, Oceans of Fun and SubTropolis.[53] From 1992 to 2009 the Chiefs conducted summer training camp at the University of Wisconsin–River Falls in River Falls, Wisconsin.[209] The Chiefs' 2007 training camp was documented in the HBO/NFL Films documentary reality television series, Hard Knocks.[210] Following the passage of a $25 million state tax credit proposal, the Chiefs moved their training camp to Missouri Western State University in St. Joseph, Missouri, in 2010.[211] The bulk of the tax credits went for improvements to Arrowhead Stadium with $10 million applied to the move to Missouri Western.[212] A climate-controlled, 120-yard NFL regulation grass indoor field, and office space for the Chiefs was constructed at Missouri Western adjacent to the school's Spratt Stadium before the 2010 season.[213] Outside of training camp and during the regular season, the Chiefs conduct practices at their own training facility nearby Arrowhead Stadium. The facility is located near the Raytown Road entrance to the Truman Sports Complex just east of Interstate 435 and features three outdoor fields (two grass and one artificial turf) as well as an indoor facility with its own full-size field. The rivalry between the Chiefs and the Las Vegas Raiders is considered as one of the NFL's most bitter, extending back into the infancy of the AFL.[214] Most notably during the era; both the Chiefs and Raiders appeared in the first two Super Bowl games.[215][216][217] Since the AFL was established in 1960, the Chiefs and Raiders have shared the same division, first being the AFL Western Conference, and since the AFL–NFL merger, the AFC West. The Chiefs lead the regular season series 73–55–2 as of the end of the 2023 season, including a 2–1 playoff record against Las Vegas.[218] A historic divisional battle for the Chiefs; the rivalry with the Los Angeles Chargers reignited during the 2020s as matchups would feature an offensive battle between Patrick Mahomes and Chargers' pro-bowl quarterback Justin Herbert.[219] The Chiefs lead 69–58–1 as of the end of the 2023 season,[220] but the Chargers won 17–0 in the only playoff meeting between the two teams, a 1992 AFC wild card game.[221] Chiefs lead 72–56 as of the 2023 season, which included a run of 16 straight wins,[222] but the Broncos won the only playoff game between the two teams, a 1997 AFC Divisional game.[223][224] The series originated during the American Football League's inaugural season in 1960, as both the Kansas City Chiefs, then known as the Dallas Texans, and Buffalo Bills were charter teams in the league.[225] Despite being in two different divisions since their founding in 1960, the Bills and Chiefs have had many notable moments in NFL postseason history, most notably the 1966 AFL Championship Game, the 2021 AFC Divisional playoff game (known especially for the infamous '13 Seconds'), and the 2024 AFC Divisional playoff game (known as 'Wide Right II'). Since 2020, the rivalry has redeveloped as both teams consistently contended for the AFC title. A rivalry has also developed between Bills quarterback Josh Allen and Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, with many comparing it to the former rivalry between Tom Brady and Peyton Manning.[226] As of 2023, Buffalo leads the series 29–25–1, but Kansas City leads the playoff series 4–2. Of the six playoff meetings the teams have contested, three were AFL/AFC championship games.[227] A relatively new rivalry for the Chiefs has formed in the 2020s with the Cincinnati Bengals. Prior to 2021, the rivalry was nonexistent. By 2021 though, the Bengals became a rising team in the AFC with the arrival of a healthy top tier quarterback in Joe Burrow, the #1 pick in the 2020 NFL draft, who could go toe to toe with Patrick Mahomes.[228] The Bengals beat the Chiefs in the 2021 regular season in Cincinnati 34–31, and then followed that up with a victory in that year's AFC Championship Game at Arrowhead, a game in which the Cincinnati defense shut the Kansas City offense down in the second half and kicker Evan McPherson hit a game winning field goal in overtime to advance to Super Bowl LVI. In 2022, the Chiefs and Bengals again met in the regular season, with the Bengals prevailing 27–24 and sealing the game off of a rare Travis Kelce fumble. The Chiefs again met the Bengals in the AFC Championship game that season. The Chiefs won the game on a walk off field goal and advanced to Super Bowl LVII thanks to Bengals defensive end Joseph Ossai hitting Patrick Mahomes out of bounds when Mahomes was scrambling for a first down, leading to an unnecessary roughness penalty.[229] The two teams met again in 2023, but did not face Joe Burrow due to Burrow suffering a season ending wrist injury earlier in the season. To date, the Joe Burrow led Bengals are the only AFC team to have a winning record against the Chiefs since Patrick Mahomes became their starting quarterback. As of 2023, the Bengals lead the all-time series 18–16.[230] When St. Louis, Missouri had NFL teams, namely the Cardinals and later the Rams, a cross-state rivalry existed with the Chiefs; with a trophy being awarded to the winner of each game. The series was active with the Cardinals from 1960 to 1988 prior to their relocation to Arizona. The series found new life from 1995 to 2015 after the Rams played in St. Louis for a 20-year tenure. Despite this, the series ended permanently following the Rams' relocation back to Los Angeles in 2016. Though, following the Rams' return to Los Angeles; the two teams would play each other during the 2018 season in a historic matchup which set the record for the third-highest scoring game of all time,[231] hailed by many as one of the greatest games in league history.[232][233] As of the 2023 season, the Chiefs lead the all-time series 8–5.[234] The Chiefs' first mascot was Warpaint, a nickname given to several breeds of pinto horse. Warpaint served as the team's mascot from 1963 to 1988.[24][235][236] The first Warpaint (born in 1955, died in 1992) was ridden bareback by rider Bob Johnson who wore a full Native American headdress.[24][235] Warpaint circled the field at the beginning of each Chiefs home game and performed victory laps following each Chiefs touchdown.[24][235] On September 20, 2009, a new Warpaint horse was unveiled at the Chiefs' home opener.[237] Warpaint was ridden by a cheerleader in its return.[238] The Chiefs again retired Warpaint in 2021 as a part of their commitment to stop the use of Native American imagery.[239] In the mid-1980s, the Chiefs featured a short-lived unnamed \"Indian man\" mascot which was later scrapped in 1988.[235] Since 1989 the cartoon-like K. C. Wolf, portrayed by Dan Meers in a wolf costume, has served as the team's mascot.[24][240] The mascot was named after the Chiefs' \"Wolfpack\", a group of rabid fans from the team's days at Municipal Stadium.[235] K. C. Wolf is one of the most popular NFL mascots and was the league's first mascot inducted into the Mascot Hall of Fame in 2006.[241] The Chiefs have employed a cheerleading squad since the team's inception in 1960.[242] In the team's early days, the all-female squad was referred to as the Chiefettes.[243] In addition to the Cheerleaders, in the early 1970s, there was also a dance/drill team that performed for pre-game and halftime. From 1986 to 1992, the cheerleader squad featured a mix of men and women.[242] From 1993 to 2019, the all-female squad has been known as the Chiefs Cheerleaders, and in 2020, one male joined the team.[235][242][243] Running backs (RB) Wide receivers (WR) Tight ends (TE) Defensive linemen (DL) Defensive backs (DB) Special teams Reserve 53 active, 10 reserve, 16 practice squad (+2 exempt) Twenty-five members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame spent at least some portion of their career with the Chiefs. Thirteen spent the majority of the career with the Chiefs. Ten of the Chiefs in the Hall of Fame were involved with the Chiefs during their Super Bowl Championship season of 1969. The Chiefs have 3 contributors, 3 coaches, and 18 players in the Hall of Fame. Derrick Thomas is the only Chief in the Hall of Fame that was inducted posthumously. Listed below are only people whose tenure with the Chiefs is their reason for induction, not former Chiefs coaches inducted as a player, the only exception being Emmitt Thomas who was inducted as a player for the Chiefs and later become an assistant coach for the team. Established in 1970, the Chiefs Hall of Fame has inducted a new member, with the exception of the 1983 and 2020 seasons, every year to honor their players, coaches, and contributors in an annual ceremony.[244][245] The requirements for induction are that a player, coach, or contributor must have been with the Chiefs for four seasons and been out of the NFL for four seasons at the time of induction.[244] There are some exceptions, such as Joe Delaney and Derrick Thomas, Delaney was with the team for only two seasons before his death, Thomas was inducted 1 year after his death in January 2000 (2 years after his final season). The Chiefs have the second-most enshrinees of any NFL team in their team Hall of Fame behind the Green Bay Packers, who have enshrined over 100 players and team contributors over the years in the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame.[244] Nineteen players and the coach of the Super Bowl IV championship team have been inducted into the ring of honor. Three players were posthumously inducted, Derrick Thomas, Joe Delaney, and Mack Lee Hill. *Posthumous induction†Hall's primary position was wide receiver and is listed in the Chiefs Hall of Honor as a receiver. However, he was inducted because of his accomplishments as a return specialist. Three Chiefs players own major NFL records. Patrick Mahomes owns the record for career quarterback rating with a minimum of 1,500 attempts with 103.9,[246] Derrick Thomas owns the record for sacks in a single game with 7 which he accomplished in 1990,[247] and Travis Kelce owns the record for career receptions in the playoffs.[248] Additionally, Tony Gonzalez, who spent the majority his career with the Chiefs, is the career receiving yards and receptions leader among tight ends. Chiefs players own several less notable records, for example, Mahomes owns the record for fastest quarterback to 100 career passing touchdowns. For a list of franchise records, see List of Kansas City Chiefs records Thirteen head coaches have served the Texans/Chiefs franchise since their first season in 1960.[249] Hank Stram, the team's first head coach, led the Chiefs to three AFL championship victories and two appearances in the Super Bowl.[250] Stram was the team's longest-tenured head coach, holding the position from 1960 to 1974.[41] Marty Schottenheimer was hired in 1989 and led Kansas City to seven playoff appearances in his ten seasons as head coach.[45][53] Schottenheimer had the best winning percentage (.634) of all Chiefs coaches.[55] Gunther Cunningham was on the Chiefs' coaching staff in various positions from 1995 to 2008, serving as the team's head coach in between stints as the team's defensive coordinator.[58][59] Dick Vermeil coached the team to a franchise-best 9–0 start in the 2003 season.[251] Of the ten Chiefs coaches, Hank Stram, Marv Levy, and Dick Vermeil have been elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, Levy is more well known for his time with the Buffalo Bills.[252] Herm Edwards served as the team's head coach from 2006 to 2008, compiling a 15–33 record and a franchise worst 6–26 record over a two-year span.[105][106][253][254] Todd Haley compiled a 19–26 record with the team from 2009 to 2011, including an AFC West division title in 2010.[107] Haley was fired with three games left in the 2011 season. Romeo Crennel was named interim coach, and was promoted to full-time coach in January 2012. Crennel was fired on Monday, December 31, 2012, after finishing the 2012 season with a 2–14 record. On January 5, 2013, the Chiefs hired Andy Reid to be their next head coach. In Reid's tenure, the Chiefs have never had a sub-.500 season, making the playoffs in 10 of his 11 seasons as head coach, winning the division six times, and twice having two consecutive Super Bowl appearances, and three wins. With a 21–14 victory over the Miami Dolphins, on November 5, 2023, in Frankfurt Germany, Andy Reid tied former Chiefs head coach Hank Stram on the franchise's all-time regular season wins list with 124 victories.[255][256] The franchise was founded in 1959 by Lamar Hunt after a failed attempt by Hunt to purchase an NFL franchise and relocate them to Texas.[257] Hunt remained the team's owner until his death in 2006.[257] The Hunt family kept ownership of the team following Lamar's death and Clark Hunt, Lamar's son, represents the family's interests.[194] While Hunt's official title is CEO and Chairman of the Board, he represents the team at all owner meetings.[258][259] In 2010, Hunt assumed role as CEO alongside his role as chairman of the board.[260] According to Forbes, the team began the 2024 season valued at $4.85 billion USD, ranking them 24th among the 32 NFL teams.[261] Owner Lamar Hunt served as the team's president from 1960 to 1976. Because of Lamar Hunt's contributions to the NFL, the AFC Championship trophy is named after him.[262] He promoted general manager Jack Steadman to become the team's president in 1977.[262] Steadman held the job until Carl Peterson was hired by Hunt in 1988 to replace him.[262] Peterson resigned the title as team president in 2008.[263] Denny Thum became the team's interim president following Peterson's departure and was officially given the full position in May 2009.[263][264] Thum resigned from his position on September 14, 2010.[260] Don Rossi served as the team's general manager for half of the 1960 season, resigning in November 1960.[25] Jack Steadman assumed duties from Rossi and served in the position until 1976.[25][41][262] Steadman was promoted to team president in 1976 and despite being relieved of those duties in 1988,[262] he remained with the franchise until 2006 in various positions.[41][45] Jim Schaaf took over for Steadman as general manager until being fired in December 1988.[45] Carl Peterson was hired in 1988 to serve as the team's general manager, chief executive officer and team president.[45][262] Peterson remained in the position for nineteen years until he announced his resignation from the team in 2008.[263][265] Denny Thum served as interim general manager[263] until January 13, 2009, when the Chiefs named New England Patriots executive Scott Pioli the team's new general manager.[104][266] Pioli was released in early January after the hiring of Andy Reid, and was replaced by John Dorsey. Pioli's record as the Chief's general manager was 23–41. On June 22, 2017, the Chiefs fired Dorsey.[267] They hired Brett Veach as the new general manager on July 10, 2017.[268] → Coaching staff → Front office → More NFL staffs Kansas City radio station KFNZ-FM (96.5) is the flagship station for The Chiefs Football Radio Network. The network has affiliates across Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, and Texas, and national reach through desktop and mobile devices. AFC Championship and Super Bowl broadcasts are exclusive to KCSP and WDAF-FM due to NFL rules surrounding the exclusivity of Westwood One's coverage outside of the immediate Kansas City area. As part of the newest television contracts, non-primetime games are broadcast on CBS or Fox with the biggest markets being the metropolitan areas of Kansas City, Wichita, and Omaha. The Chiefs' in-house production company is named 65 Toss Power Trap Productions, after a play from the Chiefs Super Bowl IV victory which led to a five-yard touchdown run by Mike Garrett.[269] The Chiefs boast one of the most loyal fan bases in the NFL.[195][270] Kansas City is the sixth-smallest media market with an NFL team, but they have had the second-highest attendance average over the last decade.[199] Studies by Bizjournals in 2006 gave the Chiefs high marks for consistently drawing capacity crowds in both good seasons and bad.[271] The Chiefs averaged 77,300 fans per game from 1996 to 2006, second in the NFL behind the Washington Redskins.[271] The franchise has an official fan club called Chiefs Kingdom which gives members opportunities to ticket priority benefits and VIP treatment.[272][273] At the end of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" before home games, many Chiefs fans intentionally yell out \"CHIEFS!\" rather than singing \"brave\" as the final word.[274] This can also occasionally be heard in road games[275] and even at sporting events for the nearby University of Kansas.[276] In 1996, general manager Carl Peterson said \"We all look forward, not only at Arrowhead, but on the road, too, to when we get to that stanza of the National Anthem... Our players love it.\"[274] After the September 11, 2001 attacks, Chiefs fans refrained from doing so in honor of those who lost their lives in the tragedy and continued to do so for the remainder of the 2001 season.[277] At the Chiefs' September 23, 2001, home game against the New York Giants, fans gave the opposing Giants a standing ovation.[198] In the past, fans would chant while pointing in the direction of the visiting team, \"We're gonna beat the hell outta you...you...you, you, you, you!\" over the song \"Rock and Roll Part 2\".[278] The chant starts after the third \"hey!\" in the song.[278] The original version of the song by Gary Glitter was previously used until the NFL banned his music from its facilities in 2006 following the British rocker's conviction on sexual abuse charges in Vietnam.[278] A cover version of the song played by Tube Tops 2000[278] was used from 2006 until the 2015 season.[279] The practice was later completely discontinued prior to the 2015 season after Glitter was arrested again.[280] The team would eventually adopt Beastie Boys' \"(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)\" after Travis Kelce shouted the main chorus while celebrating victories in the AFC Championship Game and Super Bowl.[281] Notable fans include Brad Pitt, Paul Rudd, Jason Sudeikis, Henry Cavill, David Koechner, Rob Riggle, Taylor Swift, Heidi Gardner, John Amos, Melissa Etheridge, and Eric Stonestreet.[282] Arrowhead Stadium is also recognized by Guinness World Records as having the loudest outdoor stadium in the world. This was achieved on September 29, 2014, in a Monday Night Football game against the New England Patriots when the crowd achieved a roar of 142.2 decibels[283] which is comparable to standing 100 feet (30 m) from a jet engine, which even with short term exposure, can cause permanent damage.[284] The NFL introduced the league's international home marketing area program in 2021,[285] which sees teams secure international marketing rights in countries beyond the United States. The Chiefs were designated as a home team to Germany alongside the Carolina Panthers, New England Patriots, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In 2023 the NFL also granted the Chiefs permission to expand its marketing and fan outreach to Austria and Switzerland.[286] The Chiefs hosted a game in Germany during their 2023 season against the Miami Dolphins.[287][288] The Chiefs have played international regular season games against Detroit in 2015 in London, and against the LA Chargers in 2019 in Mexico City. The team participated in preseason exhibition games dubbed the American Bowl in Berlin (1990), Tokyo (1994 and 1998), and Monterrey, Mexico (1996).[287] The Chiefs' fan base has expanded across the world like many other NFL teams. A Twitter account is dedicated to Chiefs fans in the UK and has been recognized by the Kansas City Chiefs and is their official UK fan page. They have many dedicated fans writing articles and interviewing players of the team such as Tamba Hali.[289] From various periods between 1963 and the 2008 season, trumpeter Tony DiPardo and The T.D. Pack Band played live music at every Chiefs home game.[290][291] The band was known as The Zing Band when the team was located at Municipal Stadium. DiPardo was honored by head coach Hank Stram in 1969 with a Super Bowl ring for the team's victory in Super Bowl IV.[290] When his health was declining, DiPardo took a leave of absence from the band from 1983 to 1988.[291] DiPardo's daughter took over as bandleader in 1989, by which time DiPardo returned to the band by popular demand.[291][292] For the 2009 season, due to renovations at Arrowhead Stadium, the band did not return to perform at the stadium. DiPardo died on January 27, 2011, at age 98. He had been hospitalized since December 2010 after suffering a brain aneurysm.[293] For various reasons, the team has faced charges of racism and anti-Indigenous cultural appropriation and misuse of names, symbols, and practices.[295][296] The name comes from the nickname of former Kansas City mayor Harold Roe Bartle, who nicknamed himself \"Chief\" as part of creating the Tribe of Mic-O-Say, a group affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America.[297] Over the life of the franchise the following have also been displayed: an arrowhead logo, fans' \"tomahawk chop\" gestures during games, a horse named Warpaint, the use of a large drum, and the wearing of face paint, headdresses, and other Native American symbols.[298][299] Chiefs fans also carry on a tradition that began at Florida State University in the mid-1980s by using the Seminole WarChant as a rallying cry during key moments in their football games.[300][301] Prior to each home game, a former Chiefs player[302] or a famous Chiefs fan (such as NASCAR driver Clint Bowyer[303] or rapper Tech N9ne[304]), called the honorary drum leader, bangs on a drum with a large drum stick to start the Tomahawk chop. The Chiefs' and their fans' use of Native American imagery and stereotypes has been the source of controversy, as some decry usage of symbols like the \"war drum,\" songs and spectacles like the \"Tomahawk Chop,\" and stereotypical dress of fans in faux war paint and headdresses. In 2016, Native American groups asked the Kansas City Chiefs to stop doing the tomahawk chop.[305] In the same year a similar request was made of Exeter Chiefs.[306] The editorial board of the Kansas City Star newspaper called for the cessation of the \"Tomahawk Chop\" in late 2019, noting opposition from Native Americans and Tribes, and stating that the practice stereotypes and dehumanizes Native Americans.[307] The National Congress of American Indians and the Kansas City Indian Center have called for the mascot to be retired.[308] Secretary Deb Haaland (Laguna Pueblo), the first Indigenous US Secretary of the Interior has called for teams with Native-themed mascots to change mascots, including the Chiefs.[309] Lily Gladstone (Siksikaitsitapii, Nimíipuu), the first Indigenous person nominated for an Academy Award, has also called on the Chiefs to change.[310] The Chiefs have escaped the more intense criticism of other teams, such as the Washington Redskins and Cleveland Indians who changed their names beginning with their 2022 seasons, for using Native American names and logos. Attention increased in 2020 in advance of their appearance in Super Bowl LIV.[311] While there have been efforts to address other issues, such as fans wearing warpaint and headdresses, the tomahawk chop and the accompanying chant is defended, including by some local Native Americans. In a national survey, half of Native Americans said the \"tomahawk chop\" bothered or offended them, rising to 65% among those more engaged in Native traditions.[312]",

                "content": "NEW! Find where to watch all of your favorite sports! Georgia coach Kirby Smart's father, Sonny, died early Saturday morning after suffering complications from hip surgery he underwent following a fall in New Orleans before the Allstate Sugar Bowl, the school announced. He was 76. Sonny Smart was a longtime high school football coach in Alabama and Georgia. In a statement, the University of Georgia said he died at 12:15 a.m. ET Saturday while surrounded by his wife, Sharon, and their three children: Karl, Kirby and Kendall. \"Sonny fell while walking during the day on New Year's Eve in New Orleans and fractured his hip,\" the school said. \"He was hospitalized and underwent hip surgery; unfortunately, complications arose. He fought valiantly but was unable to overcome his injuries.\" Kirby Smart spent part of New Year's Day with his father at the hospital after the Sugar Bowl was pushed back to Thursday because of a terrorist attack on Bourbon Street in which a pickup truck driver killed 14 people and injured dozens more. The Georgia coach returned to the hospital shortly after the Bulldogs' 23-10 loss to Notre Dame in a CFP quarterfinal Thursday. In the statement, the Smart family expressed their gratitude to the Ochsner Medical Center staff in New Orleans. \"Additionally, they ask for your continued prayers for those affected by the tragic events that occurred in the early hours of New Year's Day,\" the statement said. \"The Smart family treasures everyone's thoughts and prayers and now prays for God's comfort, strength, and guidance.\" South Carolina coach Shane Beamer offered his condolences on X, saying his \"heart hurts for the Smart family.\" Sonny Smart played football at Samford University in Birmingham, Alabama. He was a football coach at Holtville High School in Alabama and led the baseball team to a state title in 1982. He later coached at Bainbridge High in Georgia, where Kirby Smart played safety for him, and Rabun County High in north Georgia. \"He's taught me so much just about the way you handle things, the right way, the wrong way,\" Kirby Smart said of his father in January 2023. \"Control the controllables. The moment's never too big if you're prepared. And I always watched the way he prepared our teams and our staff in high school. \"He was a very wise man, a man of few words. I tried to follow his mantra as a coach. I've certainly evolved from going to coach for other people, but a lot of my core beliefs came from the way he ran our programs in high school.\"",

(Dean Legge/Dawg Post). Sonny Smart, the father of Georgia football head coach Kirby Smart and Rabun County resident and former Wildcat coach, passed away due to hip surgery complications after falling in New Orleans, La., early on Saturday, Jan. 4. As of late Jan. 4, funeral arrangements for Sonny Smart, 76, had not been announced. While in New Orleans to watch his son lead the Bulldogs to a hopeful victory over Notre Dame in the Allstate Sugar Bowl, Smart fell on New Year’s Eve, hours after the tragic attack on Bourbon Street that left 15 dead and dozens more injured. Smart was taken to Ochsner Medical Center soon after, but it wasn’t until nearly a day after the Bulldogs lost 23-10 to the Irish that he would lose his valiant fight. The University of Georgia released a statement regarding the Smart family. “The Smart family expresses their heartfelt gratitude to the Ocshner hospital and medical staff for the exceptional care provided to Sonny,” the statement reads. “Additionally, they ask for your continued prayers for those affected by the tragic events that occurred in the early hours of New Year’s Day. The Smart family treasures everyone’s thoughts and prayers and now prays for God’s comfort, strength and guidance.” Smart is the father of one of the most prolific coaches in college football today, Kirby Smart. However, Sonny Smart will also be known for the years of being a highly favored high school football coach, leader and friend to many. Smart finished his football career as a player at Samford University in Birmingham, Ala. Later he became the head football coach at Holtville High School in Alabama, where he also led the baseball team to a state championship in 1982. Smart also was the head football coach at Bainbridge High School, with Kirby playing for him at safety. From 1995 to 2003, Smart was the head coach at Rabun County High School and helped lead the Wildcats from a 3-7 season in his first year to an 11-2 region championship in 1998. During his head coaching tenure at RCHS, Smart's son, Kirby, also served as a community coach. Former Wildcat quarterback Billy Edwards Jr. was Sonny Smart’s gunslinger for four seasons and remembers Smart as an individual who taught him everything about the game of football and how to be an upstanding human being. “He had an ability to bring the best out in people and help them really reach heights and goals that they never knew they could really obtain themselves,” Edwards said of Sonny. “He is going to be deeply missed. He and his family have been a huge part in Rabun County and helping better the county. He's just made such an impact on so many young people, so many other people that he’s come in contact with, and he has left the world a better place.” Edwards said he immediately felt sadness when hearing of his former coach’s death. Edwards remembered back to when he made many trips to Athens with the Smart family to watch Kirby Smart play for the Bulldogs from 1995 to 1998. Sonny and his wife Sharon, who was an English teacher in Rabun County, were a huge part in Edwards’ young life. In comparison to Kirby Smart's UGA coaching style, Sonny had a very calm demeanor while coaching the Wildcats from the sidelines. Edwards said he kept his players “calm, cool and collected.” “Don’t get me wrong, he definitely had that passion about him, and I can tell you this right now, I think this is one of the things that has stuck with me forever, is that he could be as loud as it can be,” Edwards said. “But as far as his demeanor on the sideline and during any kind of intense situation, he was very calm.” Edwards said that no matter how loud the whistles of the referees and the yelling of teammates were, he could always hear Sonny’s voice stretch across the field calling his quarterback’s name. Edwards would always hear and answer the call. Smart taught Edwards everything that a good quarterback should know – whether it’s reading defensive coverages; throwing on the run; or leading an offense to a touchdown score. However, Smart believed in having a great work ethic in the classroom, being a good person and being a good community member. Edwards said Sonny helped teach all of those things to his players. Sonny also taught the Wildcats that it didn’t matter where they lived. They could become a great football team. While thinking back on the 1998 season, when the Wildcats went 9-1 in the regular season and won two playoff games before falling to Taylor County, Edwards said Sonny was a driving factor in proving that a group of mountain boys could win football games at a high level. There have been many coaches who have helped Rabun football become what it is today, most recently current Dawson County head coach Jaybo Shaw and current Wildcat head coach Michael Davis. Shaw's father, Lee, was inducted into the Rabun County Athletic Hall of Fame in 2024. Sonny sits on that list of influential coaches who have transcended the Wildcats into a winning program. “Just because we were a bunch of kids from the mountains (didn’t mean) that we were always going to be mediocre … I think him coming here proved to us that we can be competitive and we can be a program that has become what it is today,” Edwards said. Since Sonny coached in Rabun County, the Houston County, Ga., native kept close ties to the community, living here in the Northeast Georgia mountains during his retirement. Nearly 13 years ago, Sonny helped start Georgia Mountain Senior Golf (GAMS), which is an organization that brings golfers over the age of 50 together to join in fellowship, while competing in golf around the state of Georgia. In 2024, ending its 12th year, GAMS ended its season with 160 members and averaged over 90 members playing in each tournament. “He was just the consummate coach,” GAMS member Terry Graham said of Sonny. “He was a great guy, a good friend, and he’d always have time to talk with you.” Members of GAMS, Graham and Jeff Reeves of Reeves Hardware in Clayton, remembered Sonny as a great friend. “I call (GAMS) fellowship,” Reeves said. “I’ve got some really close friends that I never would have met without what coach (Sonny) Smart has done.” Sonny stepped down from his leadership role of GAMS and handed the reins to John Hood, father of former Rabun standout student-athletes Lucy and Jack Hood. However, Reeves remembers Sonny still being an advocate of the rules of golf. “We’re going to miss him every two weeks, getting onto us about slow play or not picking the ball up when you’re out of the hole,” Reeves said with a laugh. “When he spoke, people listened, that’s the character he had and it wasn’t because he thought he was better than anybody else.” Reeves described him as a regular guy who viewed himself as someone who puts his pants on the same way as anybody else. It didn’t matter if he was the head coach of a good football team or the father of the Bulldogs’ head coach. Reeves, an alumnus of Clemson University, remembered never having a quarrel with the Georgia staple who was clearly an avid fan for the Bulldogs. “He didn’t put himself on any pedestal; didn’t think that he was better than the rest of us; and that’s a problem in the world today, is (not) having some humble pride about yourself,” Reeves said. “I know he was proud of what he did as a coach and what his son has done and all of his grandchildren, but he knew what he was,” Reeves said. “He was just a regular guy (and) didn’t try to be anything more than to do the best he could with the teams that he had here.” There will be a somber feeling throughout the state of Georgia, with the loss in the Sugar Bowl and the loss to the state’s beloved Sonny Smart. However, the Northeast Georgia community can take solace in the fact that it was impacted by one of the Georgia greats.

By The Associated Press ATHENS, Ga. — Georgia coach Kirby Smart's father, Sonny, died early Saturday of complications from hip surgery after falling in New Orleans ahead of the Sugar Bowl, the school announced. Sonny Smart, a longtime high school football coach in Alabama and Georgia, fell while walking on New Year's Eve and fractured his hip. He was hospitalized and had hip surgery at Ochsner Medical Center, where he died surrounded by his family, Georgia said in a statement that did not provide his age. The Smart family was in New Orleans for the Sugar Bowl, which was pushed back a day because a man rammed a pickup truck into a crowd of New Year's revelers in the French Quarter, killing 14 people and injuring about 30. Kirby Smart's Bulldogs lost to Notre Dame 23-10 in the game, a College Football Playoff semifinal, on Thursday. Sonny Smart couldn't make it to the national title game in 2023 when Georgia beat TCU 65-7 to repeat as national champions because of health issues. Before those arose, he had been a regular at his son's games since Kirby became head coach at his alma mater in 2016. Sonny Smart, who coached Kirby when he was in high school, is survived by his wife, Sharon, and their three children, Karl, Kirby and Kendall. The Smart family said in a statement issued by Georgia that it \"expresses their heartfelt gratitude to the Ochsner hospital and medical staff for the exceptional care provided to Sonny. \"Additionally, they ask for your continued prayers for those affected by the tragic events that occurred in the early hours of New Year's Day. \"The Smart family treasures everyone's thoughts and prayers and now prays for God's comfort, strength, and guidance.\" ___ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

The 31-year-old was among 14 people killed in a vehicle attack on New Year's Day. His stepmother Alexandra \"Tiggy\" Pettifer, née Legge-Bourke, cared for Prince William and Prince Harry in the 1990s. Prince William said: \"Our thoughts and prayers remain with the Pettifer family and all those innocent people who have been tragically impacted by this horrific attack.\" This comes after palace sources said King Charles was \"deeply saddened\" by the death and has been in touch with Mr Pettifer's family. The 1 January attack saw a 42-year-old US Army veteran drive a pick-up truck into crowds along New Orleans's famous Bourbon Street before being shot dead by police. The New Orleans coroner gave Mr Pettifer's preliminary cause of death as \"blunt force injuries\", PA reports. In a tribute, Mr Pettifer's family described him as a \"wonderful son, brother, grandson, nephew and friend to so many\". Prince Harry has also been informed but will not be commenting publicly on the news. The suspect, named as Shamsud-Din Jabbar, is believed to have acted alone in a \"premeditated and evil act\", the FBI said. It added that a flag of the Islamic State group was found inside the vehicle. Two improvised explosive devices were also found nearby, according to police. A well-known American college football player, a young aspiring nurse and a mother of a four-year-old are among the victims. At least 39 people were also injured during the attack, which took place in the city's French Quarter - a bustling nightspot popular with locals and tourists - at around 03:15 (09:15 GMT) on Wednesday. Some of the injured have been discharged from hospital - but more than a dozen remain, with some being treated in the ICU. Mr Pettifer, of Chelsea, London, was named by the Metropolitan Police as among the victims on Saturday morning. His family said in a statement they were \"devastated at the tragic news of Ed's death in New Orleans\". \"We will all miss him terribly. Our thoughts are with the other families who have lost their family members due to this terrible attack. \"We request that we can grieve the loss of Ed as a family in private. Thank you.\" Foreign Secretary David Lammy said in a statement that he was \"extremely saddened to hear the tragic news that a British man was among those killed during the attack in New Orleans\". \"We are supporting their family and are united with the US against terror threats,\" the statement said. Ms Pettifer joined King Charles's staff in 1993 when he was the Prince of Wales. She became a close companion to the young princes following the separation of Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales. Ms Pettifer often accompanied the two princes on holiday and, following the death of Diana, she helped them adjust to the loss of their mother. In 1999, Ms Pettifer - née Legge-Bourke - married security consultant Charles Pettifer at a private ceremony in Wales, which was attended by William and Harry. He reportedly placed explosives in the area before changing clothes and driving into pedestrians. Officials still do not know why a US Army soldier drove the Tesla more than 800 miles from Colorado to Las Vegas. Las Vegas police say the driver of the burned vehicle is US Green Beret Matthew Livelsberger of Colorado. People partake in a moment of silence to remember the victims of Wednesday's deadly attack.

                "content": "Russell Carrington Wilson (born November 29, 1988) is an American professional football quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League (NFL). He previously played 10 seasons for the Seattle Seahawks and two seasons for the Denver Broncos. With the Seahawks, Wilson was named to the Pro Bowl nine times and helped Seattle win their first Super Bowl championship in Super Bowl XLVIII. He is regarded as one of the greatest dual-threat quarterbacks of all time.[1] Wilson played college football and baseball for the NC State Wolfpack from 2008 to 2010 before transferring to the Wisconsin Badgers in 2011, where he set the single-season FBS record for passer rating and led them to a Big Ten title and the 2012 Rose Bowl. He also played minor league baseball for the Tri-City Dust Devils in 2010 and the Asheville Tourists in 2011 as a second baseman. The Seattle Seahawks selected Wilson in the third round (75th overall) of the 2012 NFL draft. He tied the rookie record for most passing touchdowns and was named Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Year.[2] Wilson then led the Seahawks to consecutive Super Bowl appearances, winning Super Bowl XLVIII and losing Super Bowl XLIX after Wilson was intercepted at the goal line by Malcolm Butler. Wilson holds the record for most wins by an NFL quarterback through nine seasons and is one of five quarterbacks with a career passer rating over 99.[3] In 2019, he signed a four-year, $140 million contract extension with the Seahawks, becoming the highest-paid NFL player at the time. In 2020, he became the third quarterback in NFL history to throw 30 touchdowns in four consecutive seasons.[4] Wilson was traded to the Broncos in 2022 and later signed a five-year, $245 million extension. His time with the Broncos was marred with disappointment, with the Broncos having the league's worst scoring offense in 2022. Wilson was benched near the end of the 2023 season and was released in the offseason, later signing a one-year deal with the Steelers. Noted for his philanthropy, Wilson was named the Walter Payton Man of the Year in 2020 and was the recipient of the Bart Starr Award in 2022. Wilson is also part owner of the Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer (MLS). After he purchased his minority stake, the Sounders won the 2019 MLS Cup. Wilson was born at The Christ Hospital in Cincinnati,[5] and grew up in Richmond, Virginia. His parents are Harrison Benjamin Wilson III, a lawyer, and Tammy Wilson (née Turner), a nurse director.[6][7][8] He has an older brother, Harrison IV, and a younger sister, Anna.[9] Wilson started playing football with his father and brother at the age of four, and played his first organized game for the Tuckahoe Tomahawks youth football team in sixth grade.[6][10] Wilson's great-great-grandfather was enslaved to a Confederate colonel and was freed after the American Civil War.[11] Wilson's paternal grandfather, Harrison B. Wilson Jr., was a former president of Norfolk State University who played football and basketball at Kentucky State University, and his paternal grandmother, Anna W. Wilson, was on the faculty at Jackson State University.[12] Wilson's maternal grandfather was noted painter A. B. Jackson.[13] According to genetic admixture analysis, Wilson is 62% African, 36% European, 1% West Asian, and 1% Central Asian.[14][15][16] His European family lineage has been traced back to 524 A.D. to Saint Arnulf of Metz via Charlemagne.[17][18][19][20][21] Wilson has also said he has some Native American ancestry, although he did not explicitly say which tribe he came from.[22][23] Wilson's father played football and baseball at Dartmouth and was a wide receiver for the San Diego Chargers preseason squad in 1980. Wilson's brother, Harry, played football and baseball at the University of Richmond, and his sister Anna played basketball at Stanford.[24][25][26][27][28] Wilson's father died of complications from diabetes on June 9, 2010, at age 55,[24] the day after Wilson was drafted by the Rockies.[29] Wilson attended Collegiate School, a preparatory school in Richmond, Virginia.[30] As a junior in 2005, he threw for 3,287 passing yards and 40 passing touchdowns and rushed for 634 rushing yards and 15 rushing touchdowns.[31] He was named an all-district, all-region, and all-state player. Wilson was twice named the Richmond Times-Dispatch Player of the Year.[32] As a senior, he threw for 3,009 passing yards, 34 passing touchdowns, and seven interceptions. In addition, he rushed for 1,132 yards and 18 touchdowns.[33] That year, he was named an all-conference and all-state player as well as conference player of the year. He was featured in Sports Illustrated for his performance in the state championship game win. Wilson also served as his senior class president.[34] During his time in high school, Wilson attended the Manning Passing Academy, a summer football clinic run by multiple NFL MVP winner and eventual Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning. Due to this encounter, Manning recognized Wilson many years later when the latter had flown to Denver to discuss the prospect of getting drafted by the Denver Broncos, where Manning had recently signed.[35] Wilson was also a member of the Collegiate School basketball and baseball teams.[36] Sources: Wilson committed to North Carolina State University on July 23, 2006.[37] He also received a football scholarship offer from Duke University.[38] Wilson redshirted during the 2007 season at NC State.[39] In 2008, Wilson initially split time at quarterback with senior Daniel Evans and junior Harrison Beck.[40] However, Evans and Beck saw no regular season action after Week 2 and Week 5, respectively. Thereafter, Wilson led the team to a 4–3 record in the regular season which NC State finished out on a four-game winning streak.[41] During a 30–24 win over East Carolina, Wilson threw for 201 yards and three touchdowns.[42] He threw for two touchdowns in each of the last six games in the regular season.[43] In the 2008 PapaJohns.com Bowl against Rutgers, Wilson threw for 186 yards and a touchdown and rushed for 46 yards before halftime. Late in the first half, he scrambled to the Rutgers' four-yard line, where he was tackled and suffered a knee sprain. With Wilson sitting out the remainder of the game, his replacements threw a combined total of three interceptions with NC State, eventually losing 29–23.[44][40] Over the course of the season, he completed 150 of 275 attempts for 1,955 yards and 17 touchdowns with just one interception. He also recorded 116 carries for 394 yards and four touchdowns.[43] The Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) named him the first-team All-ACC quarterback. It was the first time in conference history that a freshman quarterback was named to the first team.[45] Prior to the 2009 season, Wilson was named quarterback of the pre-season all-ACC football team on July 12. On September 19, Wilson broke Andre Woodson's all-time NCAA record of 325 consecutive pass attempts without an interception against Gardner–Webb.[46] The 379-pass streak ended in a game against Wake Forest on October 3.[47] Wilson held the record until November 10, 2012, when it was broken by Louisiana Tech quarterback Colby Cameron.[48] Wilson was named honorable mention All-ACC in 2009.[49] Wilson finished the 2009 regular season with 3,027 passing yards, 31 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions as the team finished with a 5–7 record.[50][51] Wilson led the 2010 Wolfpack to a 9–4 season that included a 23–7 win over West Virginia in the 2010 Champs Sports Bowl.[52][53] He led the ACC in passing yards per game (274.1) and total offensive yards per game (307.5).[54] He was named second-team All-ACC and runner-up for ACC Football Player of the Year.[49] In May 2010, Wilson graduated from NC State in three years with a BA in communication, and took graduate-level business courses in the fall semester during the 2010 football season.[55][56][57][58][59] In January 2011, Wilson announced that he would report to spring training with the Colorado Rockies organization.[60] NC State head coach Tom O'Brien expressed reservations with Wilson's decision, saying \"Russell and I have had very open conversations about his responsibilities respective to baseball and football. While I am certainly respectful of Russell's dedication to baseball these last several years, within those discussions I also communicated to him the importance of his time commitment to NC State football.\"[61] O'Brien and his staff reached out to NFL coaches and general managers on Wilson's behalf, but he failed to receive an invitation to the 2011 NFL Scouting Combine.[62] On April 29, 2011, O'Brien announced that Wilson was granted a release from his football scholarship with one year of eligibility left.[63] On June 27, 2011, Wisconsin head coach Bret Bielema said that Wilson committed to Wisconsin for the 2011 season.[64] In the season opener against UNLV, Wilson passed for 255 yards and two touchdowns in a 51–17 victory. He also rushed for 62 yards, including a 46-yard touchdown run.[65] In the next three games, Wilson threw for three passing touchdowns in each game, victories over Oregon State, Northern Illinois, and South Dakota.[66][67][68] Following a 48–17 victory over previously undefeated #8 Nebraska, Wilson recorded a receiving touchdown in the 59–7 victory over Indiana.[69][70] Wilson helped lead the Badgers to a 6–0 start and a #4 ranking in the AP Poll.[71] The Badgers dropped their next two games, road losses to Michigan State and Ohio State.[72][73] Wilson and the Badgers reeled off four consecutive wins to end the regular season. Wilson was efficient during the winning streak, passing for nine touchdowns to no interceptions while rushing for two touchdowns.[74] At the end of the regular season, Wilson was named first team All-Big Ten by both the coaches and media. He also won the Griese-Brees Big Ten Quarterback of the Year award.[75] In the inaugural Big Ten Championship Game on December 3, Wilson threw for three touchdowns and led the Badgers to a 42–39 win over the Michigan State Spartans. Wilson was named the game's Grange-Griffin MVP.[76] In December 2011, Wilson was named a third team All-American by Yahoo! Sports, and finished ninth in Heisman Trophy voting with 52 points.[77][78] In the 2012 Rose Bowl against the Oregon Ducks on January 2, 2012, Wilson had 19 pass completions on 25 attempts for 296 yards, 18 rushing yards, and three touchdowns (two passing, one rushing) as the Badgers lost by a score of 45–38.[79] Wilson finished the season with 33 passing touchdowns, which set the single season record at Wisconsin and was the second-most in Big Ten history behind Drew Brees during the 1998 season at Purdue (39).[80] Wilson also set the single season FBS record for passing efficiency (191.8).[81] On January 28, 2012, Wilson completed his college football career at the 2012 Senior Bowl.[82] After transferring to the University of Wisconsin, Wilson earned a master's degree in educational leadership and policy analysis.[83] On January 16, 2012, Wilson began training for the NFL Scouting Combine at the IMG Madden Football Academy in Bradenton, Florida.[84][85] Prior to the 2012 NFL draft, Wilson had been projected by NFL scouts and analysts to be a middle-round pick.[86] In February 2012, former NFL quarterback and director of the IMG Madden Football Academy Chris Weinke said of Wilson, \"If he was 6–5, he'd probably be the No. 1 pick in the draft.\"[84] On April 11, 2012, ESPN Monday Night Football analyst Jon Gruden said, \"The only issue with Russell Wilson is his height. That might be the reason he's not picked in the first couple rounds.\"[87] Wilson was selected by the Seattle Seahawks in the third round (75th overall) of the 2012 NFL Draft,[91] the sixth quarterback selected.[92] The Seahawks received significant criticism for their selections in the draft, and Wilson in particular, as they had just signed free agent Matt Flynn.[93] Two weeks later, Wilson signed a four-year, $2.99 million contract with the Seahawks on May 7, 2012.[94] Wilson made his preseason debut against the Tennessee Titans on August 11, 2012, and had his first preseason start on August 24 against the Kansas City Chiefs.[95][96] Two days later on August 26, 2012, Wilson was named the starting quarterback for the first regular season game after competing with Matt Flynn and Tarvaris Jackson for the position.[97] On September 9, 2012, Wilson made his regular season debut in a 20–16 road loss to the Arizona Cardinals. He had 18 completions on 34 passing attempts for 153 yards, one touchdown, and one interception.[98] In the third regular season game on Monday night, the Seahawks won 14–12 over the Green Bay Packers on a controversial Hail Mary touchdown pass to Golden Tate.[99] The contentious nature of the replacement officials' decision on the play was widely considered to have been the tipping point that led to an agreement being reached to end the referee lockout.[100][101] Wilson earned Rookie of the Week honors for his performance in a 28–7 victory over the New York Jets on November 11; he completed 12 of 19 passes for 188 yards and two touchdowns, and rushed for 34 yards on seven attempts.[102] He was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week and FedEx Player of the Week for his performance in a 23–17 road win over the Chicago Bears in overtime on December 2.[103] In a 50–17 victory over the Buffalo Bills in Toronto on December 16, Wilson had 205 passing yards, one passing touchdown, nine rushes, 92 rushing yards, and a career-high three rushing touchdowns.[104] He earned NFL Offensive Rookie of the Month honors for December 2012 after the Seahawks went 5–0 and he had a passer rating of 115.2.[105] Wilson finished the 2012 regular season ranked fourth in the NFL in passer rating (100.0), beating the previous rookie record set by Ben Roethlisberger in 2004 (98.1), since broken by Robert Griffin III in 2012 (102.4) and Dak Prescott in 2016 (104.9).[106] He threw for 3,118 yards and 26 touchdowns, tying Peyton Manning's record for most touchdowns thrown by a rookie,[107] and rushed for 489 yards and four touchdowns. Wilson's scrambling mobility and ability to extend plays outside the pocket with his legs earned numerous comparisons to Hall of Fame quarterback Fran Tarkenton.[108][109][110] Wilson led the Seahawks to the postseason in his rookie year, with both games on the road in January. He made his postseason debut in the NFC Wild Card Round against the Washington Redskins, passing for 187 yards and rushing for 67 yards as the Seahawks rallied for a 24–14 comeback victory.[111] In the Divisional Round against the Atlanta Falcons, Wilson threw for 385 yards and rushed for 60 yards, and his team had a 28–27 lead with 31 seconds to go, but the Falcons managed to kick the winning field goal.[112] Wilson was selected as an alternate for the 2013 Pro Bowl, filling in for Matt Ryan of Atlanta.[113] At the Pro Bowl in Hawaii on January 27, Wilson completed eight of ten passes for 98 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions for a 147.1 rating.[114] At the end of the season, Wilson earned a bonus of $222,000 through the NFL's Performance-Based Pay program.[115][116] He was ranked 51st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2013.[117] The Seahawks began the 2013 season with the first 4–0 start in franchise history, before losing to the Indianapolis Colts in Week 5.[118] The Seahawks then went on a 7-game winning streak, including a 41–20 victory over the Minnesota Vikings where he posted a career-high 151.4 passer rating and culminating in a 34–7 victory over the New Orleans Saints in Week 13 in which Wilson threw three touchdown passes and earned his second NFC Offensive Player of the Week award.[119][120][121] Over the next three weeks, the Seahawks suffered divisional losses to the San Francisco 49ers and Arizona Cardinals (the loss to the Cardinals was Wilson's first home loss), but defeated the St. Louis Rams in Week 17 to finish the season with a 13–3 record, the NFC West title, and the No. 1 seed in the playoffs.[122] Wilson finished the season with 26 touchdown passes, nine interceptions, and a 101.2 passer rating, becoming the first quarterback in the Super Bowl era to post a 100+ passer rating in each of his first two seasons.[123] Wilson was named to his second Pro Bowl on December 27, 2013.[124] In the Divisional Round, the Seahawks defeated the New Orleans Saints by a score of 23–15. On January 19, 2014, Wilson and the Seahawks defeated the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship by a score of 23–17, advancing to Super Bowl XLVIII.[125] Wilson threw for 206 yards, two touchdowns, and no interceptions for a 123.1 passer rating in a 43–8 win over the Denver Broncos to give the Seahawks their first Super Bowl victory in franchise history.[126][127] With the victory, Wilson became just the second black starting quarterback to win a Super Bowl, joining Super Bowl XXII winner Doug Williams.[128] At 5'11\", he also became the shortest quarterback to win a Super Bowl, shorter than Len Dawson, Joe Theismann, and Drew Brees (all 6'0\").[129] Wilson earned a bonus of $169,141.73 for the 2013 season through the NFL's Performance-Based Pay program.[130] He was ranked 20th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2014.[131] On September 21, 2014, Wilson led the Seahawks on an 80-yard touchdown drive in overtime to defeat the Denver Broncos, 26–20, in a Week 3 rematch of the previous season's Super Bowl.[132][133] On October 6, 2014, against the Washington Redskins, Wilson set a new Monday Night Football record for rushing yards by a quarterback in a single game with 122.[134] The Seahawks clinched a playoff spot in Week 16 when the Dallas Cowboys defeated the Indianapolis Colts by a score of 42–7, eliminating the Philadelphia Eagles from postseason contention and allowing the Seahawks to clinch their spot before their Sunday Night Football matchup. On December 21, 2014, Wilson went 20-of-31 and threw for a then-career-high 339 yards with two touchdown passes and a rushing touchdown against the Arizona Cardinals in a primetime matchup on Sunday Night Football.[135] Wilson also led the offense in gaining 596 yards, setting a franchise record for most yards gained in a game. The Cardinals had the third-best scoring defense heading into Week 16. The Seahawks won 35–6 as they snapped the Cardinals' seven-game home winning streak and regained first place in the NFC West as well as the NFC's #1 seed. The Seahawks defeated the St. Louis Rams 20–6 in Week 17 to clinch the NFC West and the #1 seed for the second consecutive season, securing homefield advantage for the entirety of the NFC playoffs.[136][137] Wilson led the Seahawks to a 31–17 home win over the Carolina Panthers in the Divisional Round, making the Seahawks the first defending Super Bowl Champion to win a playoff game since the 2005 Patriots.[138] The Seahawks hosted the Green Bay Packers in their second consecutive NFC Championship. Wilson threw three first-half interceptions while completing only two passes to his own team as the Seahawks fell behind 16–0 at halftime. With the Packers leading 19–7 and five minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, Wilson threw his fourth interception. Then Wilson led the Seahawks on an improbable comeback. On the Seahawks' next drive, Wilson ran the ball in for a touchdown to cut the deficit to 19–14. After a successful onside kick recovery, Wilson led the Seahawks down the field, and Lynch scored to give the Seahawks a 20–19 lead. Wilson completed a 15-yard, two-point conversion pass to Luke Willson to make it 22–19. The Packers tied it up with a field goal at the end of regulation and forced overtime. The Seahawks won the coin toss, and the offense took the field. Wilson led the Seahawks on an 80-yard drive that was capped by a 35-yard game-winning touchdown pass to Kearse.[139] The Seahawks completed their largest postseason comeback in franchise history and clinched a Super Bowl berth.[140] Wilson would have been selected as an alternate to the Pro Bowl, but did not play because the Seahawks advanced to the Super Bowl; as Wilson did not have a chance to decline the invitation, the NFL recognizes this as a Pro Bowl berth for him.[141] Wilson became the first quarterback in NFL history to start two Super Bowls in his first three professional seasons.[142] The Seahawks became the first defending champion to return to the Super Bowl since the 2004 Patriots.[143] They faced the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX, where they were defeated by a final score of 28–24. Although the Seahawks led 24–14 heading into the fourth quarter, the Patriots scored two consecutive touchdowns to take a four-point lead with 2:02 remaining. Wilson led the Seahawks to the Patriots' one-yard line with 25 seconds remaining, but Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler intercepted a pass intended for Ricardo Lockette, sealing the victory for the Patriots.[144][145] He was ranked 22nd by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2015.[146] On July 31, 2015, the Seahawks and Wilson agreed to a 4-year, $87.6 million contract extension, making him, at the time, the second-highest-paid player in the NFL.[147] In the first nine games of the season, Wilson threw 10 touchdown passes and seven interceptions. Over the next five games, Wilson threw 19 touchdowns and no interceptions, becoming the only quarterback in NFL history to throw 3+ touchdown passes and no interceptions in five consecutive games.[148] After a 2–4 start to the season, Wilson led the Seahawks to win seven of their next eight games and clinch a fourth consecutive playoff appearance in their Week 15 win over the Cleveland Browns.[149][150] His strong performance over the second half of the season, even after losing star running back Marshawn Lynch and tight end Jimmy Graham, led many analysts to consider Wilson an MVP candidate.[151] Wilson broke numerous Seahawks single season passing records in 2015, including most passing yards (4,024), most passing touchdowns (34), and highest passer rating (110.1).[152] He became the first Seahawks quarterback to throw for over 4,000 yards in a season, and finished the year with the highest passer rating in the NFL.[153][154] Wilson's 51.7% deep ball completion percentage was the highest among NFL quarterbacks.[155] On December 22, 2015, Wilson was named to his third Pro Bowl.[156] He was ranked 17th on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016.[157] The Seahawks traveled to Minnesota to face the Minnesota Vikings in the Wild Card Round. The temperature at kickoff was −6 °F (−25 °F wind chill), making it the third coldest game in NFL history.[158] Wilson struggled in the sub-zero temperatures, throwing for 142 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. The Vikings missed a short field goal in the last minute, allowing the Seahawks to advance to the Divisional Round to face the 15–1 Carolina Panthers.[159] Down 31–0 at the half, Wilson helped lead a furious comeback attempt, but the Panthers won 31–24, denying Wilson and the Seahawks their third consecutive in the NFC Championship and a shot at a third consecutive Super Bowl appearance. In that game, Wilson threw for 366 yards, three touchdowns, and two interceptions.[160] Wilson was drafted first overall by Team Irvin in the 2016 Pro Bowl draft,[161] and in the game threw eight completions on 12 attempts for 164 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions for a 149.3 rating.[162] He was named the Pro Bowl offensive MVP.[163] The Seahawks had a solid 2016 season with Wilson at the helm. However, Wilson drew two minor injuries: his ankle during Week 1 against the Miami Dolphins after getting stepped on by defensive lineman Ndamukong Suh,[164] and his left knee against the 49ers during Week 3 after a takedown by linebacker Eli Harold.[165] The injuries hampered Wilson's trademark mobility, and many speculated that he would be rested in order to properly recover.[166] Regardless, Wilson started all 16 games in the season. On November 20, against the Philadelphia Eagles, he had a 15-yard touchdown reception on a pass from Doug Baldwin on a trick play.[167] Wilson also played the worst game of his career in 2016, throwing 5 interceptions in a 38–10 loss to the Green Bay Packers during Week 14. The team finished with a 10–5–1 record and won the NFC West.[168] Wilson put together a season where he recorded a career-high 4,219 passing yards, 21 passing touchdowns, 259 rushing yards, and one rushing touchdown.[169] The Seahawks made the playoffs, where they defeated the Detroit Lions in the Wild Card Round.[170] The win gave Wilson his eighth playoff victory.[171] However, they fell 20–36 to the eventual NFC champion Atlanta Falcons in the Divisional Round at the Georgia Dome.[172] He was ranked 24th by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017.[173] On September 5, 2017, Wilson was voted Seahawks offensive captain for the fifth consecutive season.[174] In Week 3, in a 33–27 loss to the Tennessee Titans, he was 29 of 49 for 373 passing yards and four passing touchdowns.[175] In Week 8 against the Houston Texans, Wilson posted an astounding performance, going 26 of 41 for a career-high 452 passing yards and four touchdowns in a matchup where both he and Deshaun Watson each threw over 400 yards. Wilson also rushed for 30 yards, totaling 482 yards of offense in the 41–38 victory.[176] With his strong performance, Wilson earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[177] On December 21, 2017, the Seahawks were fined $100,000 for failure to properly apply the concussion protocol on a hit Wilson sustained during the Week 10 win over the Arizona Cardinals.[178] In a Week 12 win over the San Francisco 49ers, Wilson became the winningest quarterback in a player's first six seasons with 63 wins, surpassing Joe Flacco.[179] Next week, with his 15-yard touchdown throw to running back J. D. McKissic, the third of his game, Wilson tied Eli Manning in 2011 for the most fourth quarter touchdowns in a single season with 15.[180] He went 20 for 31 for 227 yards and three touchdowns in that game, earning him NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[181] On December 19, 2017, Wilson was named to his fourth Pro Bowl.[182] The Seahawks ended the season with a 9–7 record, ending Wilson's streak of five consecutive seasons with double-digit wins and a playoff appearance. He threw for 34 touchdown passes, finishing the season as the league's leader in touchdowns thrown.[183][184] With 586 rushing yards and three touchdowns, he also finished the season as the team's leading rusher in both categories.[185][186] Wilson was ranked 11th by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2018.[187] With the Seahawks having lost many Pro Bowl starters in the offseason such as Cliff Avril, Michael Bennett, Kam Chancellor, Jimmy Graham, and Richard Sherman, and having star safety Earl Thomas injured in the beginning of the regular season, many considered the team as fringe playoff contenders given the competitiveness of teams in the NFC.[188] In addition to dealing with a re-tooled roster, Wilson also had a new offensive coordinator in Brian Schottenheimer, who replaced Darrell Bevell.[189] Wilson was once again named as a captain for the Seahawks going into the 2018 season.[190] He started the season with 298 passing yards, three touchdowns, and two interceptions in a 27–24 loss to the Denver Broncos in Week 1.[191] In Week 3, against the Dallas Cowboys, he helped lead the Seahawks to their first victory of the season with 192 passing yards and two touchdowns.[192] In Weeks 5–8, against the Los Angeles Rams, Oakland Raiders, and Detroit Lions, he had three consecutive games with three passing touchdowns.[193][194][195] In Week 13, against the San Francisco 49ers, he had 185 passing yards and four touchdowns in the 43–16 victory.[196] In Week 16, the Seahawks faced off against the top-seeded Kansas City Chiefs on NBC Sunday Night Football. Wilson out-dueled the season's eventual MVP Patrick Mahomes to lead the team to a 38–31 victory. This not only ensured another winning season for the Seahawks, but also defied early-season expectations by returning to the post-season after a one-year absence.[197] Wilson finished the season with 35 touchdowns and a 110.9 passer rating, both personal and franchise bests.[198] He also set career franchise records with most quarterback regular-season wins (75) and most touchdowns (196).[199] As the No. 5-seed in the NFC, the Seahawks faced off against the Dallas Cowboys in the Wild Card Round. Wilson passed for 233 yards and one passing touchdown to go along with a rushing touchdown as the Seahawks fell 24–22.[200] Wilson was named to the Pro Bowl for the sixth time in his career, replacing Aaron Rodgers.[201] He was ranked 25th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2019.[202] On April 16, 2019, Wilson signed a four-year, $140 million contract extension to remain with the Seahawks through the 2023 season, making him the highest paid player in the NFL.[203] In Week 2 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Wilson threw for 300 yards and three touchdowns as the Seahawks won 28–26, earning him NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[204][205] In Week 3 against the Saints, Wilson completed 32 passes for 406 yards and two passing touchdowns. In addition, he rushed seven times for 51 yards and two rushing touchdowns in the 33–27 loss.[206] In Week 5 against the Rams, Wilson threw for 268 yards and four touchdowns in the 30–29 win.[207] The next week, in a 32–28 victory over the Browns, he had 295 passing yards and two passing touchdowns.[208] In Week 9 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Wilson threw for 378 yards and five touchdowns in the 40–34 overtime win,[209] taking over the league lead in touchdowns and quarterback rating.[210] He was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance.[211] In Week 10 against the then-undefeated 49ers, Wilson threw for 232 yards, one touchdown, and one interception, and led the Seahawks to a 27–24 overtime win.[212] Wilson finished the 2019 season with 4,110 passing yards, 31 passing touchdowns, and five interceptions to go along with 75 carries for 342 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns as the Seahawks finished with an 11–5 record and made the playoffs as the NFC's #5 seed.[213] He was once again named to the Pro Bowl, but also made his first appearance on the AP All-Pro team, being named second-team quarterback after Lamar Jackson.[214][215] In the Wild Card Round against the Philadelphia Eagles, Wilson completed 18 of 30 passes for 325 yards and a touchdown. In addition, he rushed nine times for 45 yards. He accounted for 95 percent of the Seahawks total offense and led them to a 17–9 victory over the Eagles.[216] In the Divisional Round against the Green Bay Packers, Wilson threw for 277 yards and a touchdown and rushed for 64 yards during the 28–23 loss.[217] Wilson was ranked 2nd on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2020, the highest of his career.[218] Wilson started off the 2020 season going 31 of 35 for 322 passing yards and four passing touchdowns in the 38–25 victory over the Atlanta Falcons.[219] He was named the NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance in Week 1.[220] In Week 2, against the New England Patriots, he had 288 passing yards, five passing touchdowns, and one interception in the 35–30 victory.[221] Wilson continued his great start to the season with 315 passing yards and five touchdowns in the 38–31 victory over the Dallas Cowboys.[222] Wilson set an NFL record most passing touchdowns through three games with 14.[223] He was again named the NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance in Week 3.[224] On October 1, 2020, Wilson was named the NFC Offensive Player of the Month for his performance in September.[225] In Week 4, Wilson passed for 360 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception in the 31–23 victory over the Miami Dolphins.[226] In Week 5 against the Minnesota Vikings, Wilson threw for 217 yards and three touchdowns, including the game-winning six-yard touchdown pass to DK Metcalf with 14 seconds left in the game, during the 27–26 win.[227] This win was his 100th win in 148 total games as starting quarterback for the Seahawks. In Week 7 against the Arizona Cardinals, Wilson completed 33 of 50 passes for 388 yards and three touchdowns, plus rushed 6 times for 48 yards, but threw three interceptions including a costly one to Isaiah Simmons with one minute left in overtime as the Seahawks lost 37–34.[228][229] In Week 8 against the San Francisco 49ers, he threw for 261 yards and four passing touchdowns in the 37–27 victory.[230] In Week 9, against the Buffalo Bills, he had 390 passing yards, two passing touchdowns, and two interceptions to go along with a rushing touchdown in the 44–34 loss.[231] In Week 14 against the New York Jets, Wilson threw for 206 yards, four touchdowns, and one interception during the 40–3 win.[232] In the Week 17 season finale against the San Francisco 49ers, Wilson went 20 of 36 for 181 yards and two touchdowns and also rushed for 29 yards in the 26–23 victory.[233] Overall, Wilson finished the 2020 season with 4,212 passing yards, 40 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions.[234] Wilson broke his own franchise record for passing touchdowns in a single season with his efforts in 2020.[235] In the Wild Card Round, Wilson was unable to continue his success from the regular season, only completing 11 of 27 passes for 174 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception that was returned for a touchdown by Darious Williams in a 30–20 loss to the Los Angeles Rams.[236] A few days later on February 6, Wilson was named the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year for his consistent and outstanding community service throughout the entirety of his career.[237][238][239] Wilson was ranked 12th on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2021, the third highest ranking of his career.[240] During the Week 5 loss to the Los Angeles Rams, Wilson left the game after suffering a broken middle finger on his passing hand in the third quarter.[241] He had surgery to repair the injury on October 8, 2021.[242] On October 15, 2021, he was ruled out for the Week 6 game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. It was the first game he missed in his career, which ended a streak of 149 consecutive games started by an NFL quarterback, which is sixth all-time.[243] He was placed on injured reserve later that same day, ensuring he would miss the next three games at minimum.[244] He was activated off injured reserve November 12.[245] Wilson finished the season with 3,113 passing yards, 25 touchdowns, six interceptions, and an additional two rushing touchdowns as the Seahawks finished with a 7–10 record, their first losing record since Wilson's arrival.[246] Wilson earned his ninth Pro Bowl nomination after Tom Brady was unable to participate.[247] He was ranked 61st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2022.[248] On March 16, 2022, the Seahawks traded Wilson and a fourth-round pick to the Broncos in exchange for two first-round picks, two second-round picks, a fifth-round pick, quarterback Drew Lock, defensive lineman Shelby Harris, and tight end Noah Fant.[249] Teammates said the trade was unavoidable, as Wilson broke with the team and \"checked out\" mid-season.[250] Seahawks chairperson Jody Allen released a statement indicating that the trade was initiated by Wilson.[251] The Seahawks said that Wilson did not approve of the team firing offensive line coach Mike Solari and offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer.[252] Wilson said that while he did not initiate the trade, the decision was mutual.[253] Before he left the Seahawks, Wilson reportedly asked for the firing of coach Pete Carroll and general manager John Schneider,[254] which Wilson denied.[255] On September 1, 2022, Wilson signed a five-year, $245 million contract extension with the Broncos.[256] In the season opener of the 2022 season, against the Seattle Seahawks, Wilson completed 29 of 42 passes for 340 yards and one touchdown in a 17–16 loss to his former team.[257] In Week 2 against the Houston Texans, Wilson went 14 of 31 for 219 yards, one touchdown, and one

Growing up in Richmond, Virginia, Russell developed a love for football at a young age. After high school, Russell went played collegiate football at North Carolina State and the University of Wisconsin where he set numerous records and garnered national acclaim. His success led him to be drafted by the Seattle Seahawks in 2012. In his ten seasons with the team, Russell led the Seahawks to more wins than any other quarterback in team history, including a victory in Super Bowl XLVIII (2013). In 2014, he led Seattle to a second straight Super Bowl berth as a two-time NFC Champion (2013, 2014). He has been recognized as one of the league’s top quarterback with nine NFL Pro Bowl selections to date. Russell recently completed his 10th season with the Seahawks and he holds the NFL record for most regular season wins by a QB in his first nine seasons (98) and the second-highest passer rating in NFL history. In Spring 2022, Russell signed with the Denver Broncos and started his first season with the team in Fall 2022. He is currently the quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers. Off the field, Russell has demonstrated a deep commitment to community service and cause work. In 2014, Russell founded The Why Not You Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to creating real and lasting change in the world by motivating and empowering today’s youth. In addition to financially supporting organizations aligned with the Foundation’s mission, Russell and his wife work to extend the Foundation’s impact by making weekly visits to Seattle Children’s Hospital where he lifts the spirits and brings joy to the hearts of patients and their families. In the fall of 2021, Russell and Ciara celebrated the grand opening of the first Why Not You Academy, a tuition-free charter public high school they founded alongside educational leaders Garth Reeves and Scott Canfield. Why Not You Academy serves systemically underserved students just South of Seattle by providing an innovative and tailored learning experience.

He led the show with a moving speech about the fight for racial equality in response to movement for Black lives across the world. He was recognized with NFL’s prestigious Walter Payton Man of the Year Award in 2021 which honored his longstanding commitment to giving back. He was also awarded the Bart Starr Award for his service, during the 2022 Super Bowl weekend. In the preceding year, he collaborated with Feeding America and Wheels Up to donate 10 million meals to families experiencing food insecurity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Russell’s leadership, passion and business acumen have resulted in assembling an impressive and diverse portfolio of business ventures. He has landed major endorsements and global ambassadorships with companies including Nike, Microsoft, Wilson, Alaska Airlines, Bose, Amazon, Verizon and Fantatics and he is the lead investor in a Juice Press franchise and TruFusion in Seattle. In 2016, Russell launched a men’s lifestyle apparel line, Good Man Brand, which is sold by major department stores including Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus, in addition to having a partnership with Amazon Fashion. The brand’s ethos is drawn from traits Russell found in the good men in his life and the clothing aims to bring out the best in its customers by helping them look good and feel good, so they can live life, work hard and help others. In 2020, Russell expanded his fashion empire with Ciara and together they created The House of LRC, based upon the principles of Love, Respect, and Care. The House of LR&C includes the already established Good Man Brand, Human Nation, a line that promotes the ideas of community, inclusivity, and sustainability, and Lita, an accessible, luxury line for women. As an extension of his work on the field, Russell and the late famed mental conditioning coach Trevor Moawad founded Limitless Minds, a business coaching consultancy dedicated to optimizing performance and enriching culture within some of the world’s top organizations and elite performers. Russell also established the Russell Wilson Quarterback Academy as a springboard to develop quarterback prospects using unique and cutting-edge curriculum based on his own experiences and knowledge. The quarterback school exists as an extension of the Russell Wilson Passing Academy, a summer football camp for children of all ages. Since its inception in 2012, the RWPA has held camps in nine cities and worked with more than 9,000 children. Continuing his commitment creating opportunities for kids to play football, he was recently named the Chairman of NFL Flag and helped found the Russell Wilson NFL Flag league in Seattle.

Report as Newcastle come from behind to win 2-1 at Spurs for a sixth straight win in all competitions; Dominic Solanke gave Spurs a fourth-minute lead before Anthony Gordon controversially equalised despite a Joelinton handball in the build-up; Alexander Isak scored a 38th-minute winner Saturday 4 January 2025 21:34, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player A controversial Anthony Gordon equaliser followed by Alexander Isak's winner saw Newcastle come from a goal down to beat Tottenham 2-1 for a sixth consecutive victory in all competitions. After Dominic Solanke's fourth-minute opener, Spurs were left fuming with Gordon's sixth-minute leveller after the ball hit Joelinton's hand in the build-up but VAR allowed the goal to stand because \"his arm was by his side, in a natural position and the contact was accidental\". Ex-Premier League referee Mike Dean agreed with the decision on Soccer Saturday as Joelinton's alleged handball \"did not lead directly to a goal\" after the deflection fell to Bruno Guimaraes before Gordon expertly finished past Spurs debutant Brandon Austin. The FA laws stipulate that Newcastle's equaliser would have been ruled out if Joelinton had scored immediately after the ball touched his hand - even though the contact has been deemed accidental. But because it was Gordon that scored after a pass from Guimaraes following the ball striking Joelinton's arm, which was deemed to be in a natural position, the goal was given. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player It meant Eddie Howe's fifth-placed side piled more misery on injury-ravaged Tottenham - who finished the game without a recognised centre-back - to leave Ange Postecoglou's side winless in their last six Premier League home games and in the bottom half of the table in 12th putting them closer to the relegation zone than the top four. New England head coach Thomas Tuchel, attending his first match as Three Lions boss, would have been delighted to see two English players score the first two goals in north London as Solanke headed Spurs into a fourth-minute lead. Tottenham: Austin (7); Porro (7), Dragusin (5), Gray (6), Spence (7); Bergvall (6), Sarr (6); Johnson (6), Kulusevski (6), Werner (5); Solanke (7).

Subs: Barnes (6), Willock (6), Longstaff (6), Kelly (6). Player of the Match: Anthony Gordon. But just 140 seconds later Gordon controversially equalised despite a lengthy VAR check for Joelinton's alleged handball. A furious Postecoglou then saw his side lose their momentum as Newcastle turned up the pressure which eventually told in the 38th minute as Isak maintained his red-hot form with a scrappy close-range finish to score for a seventh consecutive Premier League game.

Despite a patched-up defence, Spurs did push for a second-half equaliser as Brennan Johnson hit the post while substitutes James Maddison and Sergio Reguilon both put efforts wide. But Newcastle held on for a perfect start to 2025 to move a point behind fourth-placed Chelsea and heap more pressure on Postecoglou.

He added: \"Considering everything we had to go through and the situation we're in right now, to put on a performance like that, I take my hat off to the players. I thought they were outstanding. \"I'm just really, really angry, as angry as I've ever been in my career, that they were denied the right rewards for a fantastic performance.\" Asked to clarify whether he was angry at the officiating: \"I know you just want me to say something, but I'm not going to. I think it's clear. Whether people agree with me or not, you think it wasn't handball or it was accidental or whatever, I'm just not interested in any of that discussion. \"What I'm saying is that on any given day, with a fair and even playing field and logical thought processes, we would have won that game.

Newcastle United won a fifth consecutive game to pile the misery on Tottenham Hotspur as Eddie Howe’s side came from behind to beat their depleted hosts. Spurs were missing a host of first-time players due to injury or illness but Dominic Solanke gave them an early lead in front of on-looking England manager Thomas Tuchel. But it was quickly cancelled out by Anthony Gordon, much to the fury of Ange Postecoglou after the ball struck off the arm of Newcastle midfielder Joelinton in the build-up. Newcastle took control and Alexander Isak continued his red-hot form as he poked in at the back post to score for the seventh Premier League game in a row and give the visitors a deserved lead. Tottenham improved and were the better team after half-time, as Heung-min Son and James Maddison were called from the bench, but Newcastle held on to climb into fifth place in the Premier League table. Tottenham remain 11th, with just one win from their last eight, but could drop further by the end of the weekend after suffering a 10th league defeat of the season. Follow all the reaction below A fuming Ange Postecoglou said his depleted Tottenham side would have beaten Newcastle had the match taken place on a “an even and fair playing ground” after the visitors scored a controversial equaliser in their 2-1 win. Postecoglou said he was “proud” of his team’s “outstanding” efforts but was furious with Newcastle’s equaliser in the first half, which came just two minutes and 20 seconds after Dominic Solanke’s early opener. Tottenham lost possession playing out from defence but the ball struck Newcastle midfielder Joelinton’s hand in the build-up as up Anthony Gordon went on to score. Newcastle’s equaliser came through a Joelinton handball as Postecoglou said his side deserved to win Newcastle came from behind to clinch a fifth straight Premier League win and inflict more pain on Ange Postecoglou’s depleted Tottenham. Spurs, who were without 11 players, went ahead after four minutes through Dominic Solanke but their celebrations were short-lived with Anthony Gordon able to equalise in the sixth minute. There was an element of controversy about the leveller after Joelinton handled in the build-up, but VAR allowed the goal to stand and Eddie Howe’s men claimed all three points thanks to Alexander Isak’s 14th goal of the season before half-time.

Ange Postecoglou, speaking to TNT Sports, says he is “proud” of his team and believes Tottenham deserved to win the game. “Hugely proud of the players. Outstanding considering the situation we are in. We deserved to win that game. All things being equal we would have.” Asked about Newcastle’s first goal, which hit Joelinton’s hand. “I don’t feel hard done by. That’s the way they want to do things. The last thing I want is an explanation.” Just one Premier League win in eight for Tottenham now since beating Manchester City 4-0 in November. It’s five points from a possible 24 during that run. They could finish the weekend in 14th, but that would require Manchester United beating Liverpool and West Ham beating Man City. A great game for the neutral and Newcastle showed their steel in the second half. It was reminiscent of their top-four campaign from a couple of years ago where Eddie Howe’s team showed lots of fight and grit at times. How Tottenham could use some of that. They contributed to another entertaining game but that’s the problem. They were just a bit too easy to play against at times in the first half, which is understandable given their absences. A very good win for Newcastle, who climb up to fifth! Six wins in a row in all competitions and five in the Premier League. 90+10 mins: We go on. One last chance for Spurs to get it long but Livramento wins the challenge with Son. Tonali wins a throw on the far side, in front of the Newcastle fans. 90+9 mins: Newcastle have the ball back in the corner. Guimaraes and Joelinton are loving it. 90+7 mins: SAVE! Another brilliant Porro delivery from the right is met by Solanke. But he can’t steer the header either side of Dubravka! 90+5 mins: Another save for Brandon Austin as he stands up to save Harvey Barnes’ flick. Bruno Guimaraes celebrates another Newcastle corner - and I don’t think this will come into the box.

Having to contend with a long injury list and an illness which swept through the squad this week, we still produced a display full of character and commitment, with Academy graduate Brandon Austin epitomising the manner of the display with an assured and composed performance in goal on his Spurs debut at the age of 25. This was Austin’s 50th appearance in a Premier League matchday squad and his first competitive game in our colours. We took an early lead through a fine diving header from Dominic Solanke before Newcastle hit back immediately through Anthony Gordon, with Alexander Isak applying the finishing touch to a well-worked move to give the visitors the advantage going into half-time. We were the dominant team throughout most of the second half, Solanke close again with another couple of headers but we just couldn’t fashion that one chance to equalise. It was an explosive start to the game with two goals in the opening six minutes to warm everyone up on a freezing afternoon. We took the lead in the fourth minute, Solanke’s diving header from Pedro Porro’s cross beating Martin Dubravka but the visitors responded almost immediately, Gordon with an angled drive past Austin, although what seemed a clear handball from Joelinton in the build-up was cleared by VAR and the goal stood. A superb run from Brennan Johnson led to another chance for us in the 11th minute, the ball breaking for Solanke whose shot was well blocked by Sven Botman, while Austin made a smart save at the other end to keep out another Gordon effort. A big opportunity came the way of the Magpies just after the half-hour mark, Jacob Murphy’s low ball across the six-yard box touched just wide of the far post by Isak with Gordon waiting at the back post to tap home. However they did take the lead on 38 minutes, Murphy again down the right and this time his cross was diverted by Radu Dragusin onto Isak and he side-footed home from close range. The visitors were certainly having the better of the exchanges at that stage but we kept persevering with our football and Timo Werner almost got on the end of the another dangerous Pedro Porro cross as the half drew to a close. With just a one-goal deficit we were always in the game and almost levelled 10 minutes into second half, Dubravka getting down low to save Pape Matar Sarr’s shot with Johnson firing the rebound against the post from a very tight angle. At the other end, Archie Gray blocked Sandro Tonali’s fierce drive with Gordon blazing the rebound way over the bar. We made a triple change just after the hour with Heung-Min Son, James Maddison and Yves Bissouma on for Werner, Lucas Bergvall and Sarr as we searched for a way back into the game and we certainly had the upper hand for much of the second period. Maddison almost drew us level in the 82nd minute, curling just wide from a short corner before a crazy scramble in the area saw Johnson fizz the ball across the face of goal without it getting a touch before substitute Sergio Reguilon picked it up and drilled back across goal, again nobody on hand to touch it home. With 10 minutes of stoppage time added on, we continued to be the team playing the better football and Solanke was just over the bar with a looping header from Dejan Kulusevski’s cross, although Austin had to be on guard to push away a shot from Harvey Barnes at the other end. Another Solanke header brought a diving save out of Dubravka as the clock ticked down but that proved to be our last chance of the afternoon. Spurs (4-3-3): Austin, Pedro Porro, Dragusin (Reguilon 46), Gray, Spence, Bergvall (Maddison 62), Sarr (Bissouma 62), Kulusevski (c), Johnson, Solanke, Werner (Son 62).

                "title": "Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball program is the men's college basketball team of the University of Kentucky. It has eight NCAA championships, the best all-time winning percentage, and the most all-time victories.[2] The Wildcats compete in the Southeastern Conference and are coached by Mark Pope.[3] Adolph Rupp first brought Kentucky to national prominence, winning four NCAA titles. Since then, Joe B. Hall, Rick Pitino, Tubby Smith, and John Calipari each won a national championship, making Kentucky the only school with five coaches to win NCAA championships and placing it second only to UCLA for most titles. Kentucky has finished as the NCAA runner-up four times, making it tied with UCLA and North Carolina for all-time title game appearances at 12. The program has played in 17 NCAA Final Fours, tying Duke for third-all time behind North Carolina and UCLA. Kentucky leads all schools in several NCAA tournament stats: Elite Eight appearances at 38, Sweet Sixteen appearances at 45, total NCAA tournament appearances at 60, and tournament games played at 184. The program is behind only North Carolina with 131 NCAA tournament wins, North Carolina has 132. Kentucky has also won the National Invitation Tournament twice, making it the only school to win multiple NCAA and NIT championships, and it leads all schools in total postseason appearances at 68. Additionally, the Helms Athletic Foundation declared Kentucky the 1933 and 1954 national champions, the latter being Kentucky's only undefeated team in the modern era (post-1930). The 1948 NCAA champion team, coached by Rupp, represented the United States in the Olympics and won a gold medal. Kentucky was the first program to 1000 wins in 1968 and the first to 2000 wins in 2009. The program leads all schools with sixty-three 20-win seasons, sixteen 30-win seasons, and six 35-win seasons. Additionally, Kentucky is second among all teams in conference regular season championships with 53. Throughout its history, the Kentucky basketball program has featured many notable and successful players, both on the collegiate level and the professional level. Five players have been named national player of the year, with Anthony Davis in 2012 and Oscar Tshiebwe in 2022 being consensus selections. Three players have been named national freshman of the year: John Wall in 2010, Davis in 2012, and Reed Sheppard in 2024. Thirty-nine players have been selected as All-Americans a total of 51 times. Kentucky holds the record for the most overall NBA Draft selections (128) and three Wildcats have been selected as the first overall pick (Wall, Davis, and Karl-Anthony Towns). Thirty-nine players have been honored with jersey retirements, as well as Rupp, Hall, Pitino, Smith, equipment manager Bill Keightly, and broadcaster Cawood Ledford. Seven players have been enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame, as well as Rupp, Pitino, Calipari, Eddie Sutton, and Ledford. During Kentucky's earliest seasons the program went through multiple coaches, with the majority staying only one or two seasons. Records indicate that the first head coach of the Wildcats was W. W. H. Mustaine, who in 1903 called together some students, took up a collection totaling $3 for a ball, and told the students to start playing.[4] The first recorded intercollegiate game at the college was a 15–6 defeat to nearby Georgetown College. The team went 1–2 for their first \"season\", also losing to Kentucky University (later Transylvania University) but defeating the Lexington YMCA.[5] Through 1908, the team did not manage a winning season, and had an all-time record of 15–29. In the fall of that year a full-time head coach was hired, Edwin Sweetland. This made him the first paid coach in Kentucky's basketball history.[6] That year, the team went 5–4, and only three years later, boasted their first undefeated season with nine victories and no losses.[7] The 1914 team under Alpha Brummage, led by brothers Karl and Tom Zerfoss, went 12–2 and defeated all its Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association opponents. In 1919, George Buchheit became the new head coach of the Wildcats. An alumnus of the University of Illinois, he brought with him a new system of basketball. The \"Buchheit system\" or \"Illinois system\", focused on defense and featured one player standing under each basket, while three roamed the court. Bucheit varied the system he learned in Illinois in one important way. While the Illinois system employed a zone defense, Buchheit's system used an aggressive man-to-man scheme. On offense, he used a complicated system of passing called the \"zig-zag\" or \"figure eight\" offense.[8] Although the team had a losing season in Buchheit's first year, they won the first-ever Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association tournament the next year, defeating the heavily favored Georgia Bulldogs. Both of these teams were composed entirely of native Kentuckians, anchored by All-American Basil Hayden. The tournament victory was considered Kentucky's first major success, and the 1921 team became known as the \"Wonder Team.\"[9] In 1922, the team was unable to build on the success of the \"Wonder Team.\" Although every player was eligible in 1922, two key players, Hayden and Sam Ridgeway, were injured before the start of the season. Hayden returned from his knee injury during the season, but was never able to play at the level he had the previous year. Ridgeway fought a year-long battle with diphtheria, and although he recovered, never played for the Wildcats again. The remaining three members of the \"Wonder Team\" went 9–5 for the season, and bowed out of the SIAA tournament in the second round.[10] Buchheit remained as coach through the 1924 season before moving on to coach Trinity College (later Duke University). A different coach would guide the team for each of the next four years. C.O. Applegran immediately followed Buchheit, and his 1925 team posted a respectable 13–8 record. Applegran in college had played for the University of Illinois, where he became an All-American. The next year, Ray Eklund led the team to a 15–3 record, and produced UK's second All-American, Burgess Carey.[11] The record was enough for Kentucky to win their first regular season conference championship in the Southern Conference. Seeing the cupboard largely bare for the upcoming year, Eklund resigned shortly before the start of the 1927 season. The team scrambled to find a new coach, and former player Basil Hayden left his coaching job at Kentucky Wesleyan College to answer the call. An inexperienced coach and a roster largely depleted of talent left the Wildcats with a 3–13 record that year. The disappointment convinced Hayden that he wasn't the \"coaching type\", and he resigned after the season. Fortunately for the Wildcats, 1927 would be their last losing season for six decades.[12] The Wildcats' new coach for the 1927–28 season was John Mauer. Although he had a talented group of players moving up from the junior varsity team, Mauer quickly discovered that his players did not know the fundamentals of the game. He began a regimen of three-hour practices five days a week during the preseason. The practice began with half an hour of shooting drills and usually ended with a full-court scrimmage. Between the two, Mauer worked on skill drills and scenarios. Mauer's teams were nicknamed the \"Mauermen.\"[13] Teamwork was the hallmark of Mauer's system. Every player worked on every aspect of the game; there were no specialists. Like Buchheit, Mauer employed a strong man-to-man defense. He utilized a slow-break offense that relied on a complicated system of short passes to get a good shot. Two elements of Mauer's system were new to basketball in the south – the offensive screen and the bounce pass. The latter was so new to most of UK's opponents that it was referred to as the \"submarine attack.\"[14] Over his three-year tenure, Mauer led the Wildcats to an overall record of 40–14. One major prize eluded him, however. Despite having teams that were almost universally acknowledged as the \"class of the South\", Mauer never led a team to the Southern Conference title. Despite his innate ability for coaching, Mauer lacked the ability to heighten his team's emotions for a big game, a fault that was cited as the reason for his lack of tournament success. Mauer left the Wildcats to coach the Miami University Redskins following the 1930 season.[15] In 1930, the university hired Adolph Rupp, who had played as a reserve for the University of Kansas 1922 and 1923 Helms National Championship teams,[16] under coach Forest C. \"Phog\" Allen. At the time of his hiring, Rupp was a high school coach in Freeport, Illinois.[4] Rupp coached the University of Kentucky men's basketball team from 1930 to 1972. There, he gained the nicknames, \"Baron of the Bluegrass\", and \"The Man in the Brown Suit\". Rupp, who was an early innovator of the fast break and set offense, gained a reputation as an intense competitor, a strict motivator, and strategist. Rupp's Wildcat teams won 4 NCAA championships (1948, 1949, 1951, 1958), one NIT title in 1946, appeared in 20 NCAA tournaments, had 6 NCAA Final Four appearances, captured 27 Southeastern Conference (SEC) regular season titles, and won 13 SEC tournaments. Rupp's Kentucky teams also finished ranked No. 1 on 6 occasions in the final Associated Press college basketball poll and 4 times in the United Press International (Coaches) poll. In addition, Rupp's 1966 Kentucky squad (nicknamed \"Rupp's Runts\", as no starting player on the squad was taller than 6'5\") finished runner-up in the NCAA tournament, and his 1947 Wildcats finished runner-up in the NIT. Rupp's 1933 and 1954 Kentucky squads were also awarded the Helms National Championship, and his 1934 and 1947 teams were retroactively recognized as the national champion by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.[17][18][19][20] Rupp gave the '44 team the nickname \"the Beardless Wonders\" and \"Wildkittens\" because according to Rupp, \"It was like running a Kindergarten\".[citation needed] Of the young players, Kentucky's best player was freshman Chad Anderson who, at the age of 17, was named consensus All-American, making him the youngest player to ever earn the title. The Beardless Wonders won 19 of their 21 games, enough to be invited into the NIT. There they were matched up with a Utah team nicknamed the \"Blitz Kids\".[citation needed] Both teams went into the half tied at 24, but with the help of Brannum Kentucky pulled away to win 46–38. Kentucky lost the next game to home town Saint John's.[citation needed] On the way to its first NCAA title, Kentucky went on to a record of 36–3. Of these three losses, all were either away or at neutral sites, keeping Kentucky undefeated at home throughout the entire season. Kentucky started off the beginning of the season with a 7–0 record heading into their away game at Temple. However, Temple was able to give the Cats their first loss by one point, 60–59. But the Wildcats rolled off an 11-win streak before playing at Notre Dame, where they lost 55–64. They did not lose a game for the rest of the regular season. Kentucky continued through the NCAA tournament to the finals, where they faced the Baylor Bears. Kentucky won its first NCAA title in a decisive 58–42 victory. The season did not end after the NCAA tournament, as Kentucky who would play in the Olympic Trials, where they went 2–1, only losing to the Phillips Oilers once. This was performance enough to represent the United States in the 1948 Olympic Games. Despite only being a college team, the starting 5 of Kentucky defeated all of its competition in London, making Kentucky the only team to win both an NCAA title and an Olympic gold medal.[citation needed] Adolph Rupp soon gave this team the nickname \"The Fabulous Five\", in honor of their accomplishments.[citation needed][21] For the 1949 season Kentucky had high expectations with most of the Fabulous Five returning. Big Blue Nation's expectations were met as the 1949 team won one more game than the previous year including both a SEC regular season and SEC tournament championship, while also getting back to the Final Four that March. In the finals Kentucky faced the Oklahoma A&M Cowboys, a team that had previously seen success in the tournament with back-to-back championships in 1945 and 1946. The Fab Five would succeed again winning 46–36 and Kentucky's only back-to-back NCAA championship. Kentucky was the second program in NCAA history to win back-to-back championships (there have been six other schools since). With a returning star player like Bill Spivey, Kentucky hoped to carry their success into the new decade. The Wildcats lost their first game by 11 to Saint John's at home, but they would pull it together for the Sugar Bowl Tournament, which they won, beating NCAA runner-up Bradley. After losing to Tennessee, Kentucky struggled to chain two wins together, losing every other game. They defeated their next 14 opponents, including getting revenge in SEC tournament championship over Tennessee. Heading into the post-season, No. 3 Kentucky played CCNY in the NIT, missing the NCAA tournament. The Wildcats were no match and were thrashed by the CCNY Beavers, 50–83. Over the season Kentucky defeated four top 10 teams, and were ranked in the top 5 the entire season. Vanderbilt, however, knocked off the top ranked Wildcats in the SEC tournament finals denying them an eighth straight SEC tournament title. Kentucky then defeated fourth ranked Kansas State 68–58 in the NCAA finals, . Adolph Rupp was the head coach at Kentucky during the year of the point-shaving scandal of 1951. In 1945 former Kentucky football player Nick Englisis met Kentucky player Ralph Beard while the two played football at Kentucky. Englisis entered the gambling business when he left the football team in 1946, then approached three Kentucky basketball players Ralph Beard, Alex Groza, and Dale Barnstable with his associates in late 1948 about potentially point shaving (fixing the score of games) during the upcoming season in exchange for money. The three players agreed to point shave and successfully shaved points in several games during the 1948–1949 season until an effort to point shave caused the Wildcats to lose to the Loyola Ramblers in the National Invitation Tournament. Groza, Beard, and Barnstable attempted to win the game under the point spread but kept the score too close, allowing the Ramblers to win the game with an impressive performance at the end of the second half. Kentucky faced Villanova in their first game of the NCAA tournament following the loss to Loyola and the three players attempted to win over the point spread. When Groza, Beard, and Barnstable failed to win over the point spread, it caused Englisis to lose all of his money and ended the point shaving deals between Englisis and these three players.[22] On October 20, 1951, Alex Groza, Ralph Beard, and Dale Barnstable were arrested for taking bribes from gamblers to shave points during several games including the National Invitation Tournament game against the Loyola Ramblers in the 1948–49 season.[23][24] At the conclusion of this scandal, a subsequent NCAA investigation found that Kentucky had committed several rule violations, including giving illegal spending money to players on several occasions, and also allowing some ineligible athletes to compete.[24] As a result, the Southeastern Conference voted to ban Kentucky from competing for a year and the NCAA requested all other basketball-playing members not to schedule Kentucky, with eventually none doing so.[25] As a result of these actions, Kentucky was forced to cancel the entire 1952–53 basketball season. Years later, Walter Byers, the first executive director of the NCAA, unofficially referred to this punishment as the first de facto NCAA death penalty, despite the current rule first coming into effect in 1985, thus the NCAA having no such enforcement power previous to that.[26][27] Echoing Mr. Byers' view, the NCAA's official stance is very much the same, and they now state in hindsight, \"In effect, it was the Association's first death penalty, though its enforcement was binding only through constitutional language that required members to compete against only those schools that were compliant with NCAA rules. Despite fears that it would resist, Kentucky accepts the penalty and, in turn, gives the NCAA credibility to enforce its rules.\" [28] The team posted a perfect 25–0 record in the next year (Rupp's only undefeated season), for which it was awarded the 1954 Helms National Championship. In addition, Kentucky also finished ranked No. 1 in the final Associated Press poll. On the team were three players who had graduated at the conclusion of the previous academic year. When, at the last minute, the NCAA ruled these players ineligible from post-season play, Rupp decided to skip the 1954 NCAA Tournament in protest.[citation needed] The \"Fiddlin' Five\" team earned their name though playing around and mistakes, which Rupp described as fiddling. The Fiddlin' Five still has the most losses out of any Kentucky's championships, with six, three of those were in four games.[citation needed] Unlike the Fab Five or the 1951 teams, the Fiddling Five would yoyo in the rankings with their lowest a No. 13 coming after 56–57 loss to unranked Loyola Chicago. Kentucky improved through the tournament though, and won their fourth title over No. 18 Seattle in the confines of Louisville's Freedom Hall. Rupp's last Final Four team and one of his last chances at a 5th NCAA title occurred in the 1965–66 season, with Kentucky going all the way to the NCAA title game. The 1966 NCAA championship game against Texas Western (now University of Texas-El Paso or UTEP) marked the first occurrence that an all-white starting five (Kentucky) played an all-black starting five (Texas Western) in the NCAA championship game.[citation needed] Texas Western won the game 72–65, on the night of March 19, 1966. Kentucky entered the tournament with only one loss and ranked No. 1, Texas Western also had only one loss and entered the tournament ranked second. Kentucky was a 6.5 point favorite in the game[29] The game was depicted in the film Glory Road.[citation needed] This game, and the result of it, were especially significant as the game came at a time when the civil rights movement was coming into full swing around the country. In 1969, after actively recruiting black players for over six years (his first formal scholarship offer was to Wes Unseld in 1964), despite most of the other SEC teams threatening to boycott if a black player took the court), Rupp finally signed his first black player, Tom Payne, an athletic 7'-1\" center out of Louisville. This ended the aspect of all-white Kentucky teams forever, and marked a new era with many notable black Kentucky basketball legends, including Jack Givens, Sam Bowie, Kenny Walker, Jamal Mashburn, Tayshaun Prince, Rajon Rondo, John Wall, Anthony Davis, and Karl Anthony Towns.[30] The late Rupp years looked promising with Dan Issel's commitment to the Wildcats in 1966. Over the next four years Issel scored an average of 25.7 per game, adding up to 2,137 points in his college career. This made Issel the player with the most points to ever play at Kentucky, a feat that has not been matched to this day. This included his 53 points scored against Mississippi State in 1970, the most by a Kentucky player in a single game until Jodie Meeks made 54 against rival Tennessee on January 13, 2009. Issel did not capture the national championship in his college years, but would go on to make a name for himself in the ABA.[citation needed] After 1966 Rupp saw continued success, but the Final Four eluded him. The Wildcats ended with a 13–13 season and missed the tournament altogether in 1967, then reach the Elite Eight and Sweet Sixteen in the next two years. Ranked #1 in the nation with a 26–1 record overall, Kentucky nearly missed a Final Four berth in a 106–100 shootout against Jacksonville. [citation needed] Rupp was forced into retirement in March 1972, after reaching age 70. At the time, this was the mandatory retirement age for all University of Kentucky employees. He was a 5-time National Coach-of-the-Year award winner, a 7-time Conference Coach-of-the-Year award winner, and was elected a member of both the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and College Basketball Hall of Fame. Further, since 1972, the Adolph Rupp Trophy, considered one of the nation's premier basketball awards, has been given by Commonwealth Athletic Club to the nation's top men's college basketball player. In addition, the University of Kentucky retired a jersey in his honor in the rafters of Rupp Arena, a 23,500-seat arena named after him, dedicated in 1976.[17][18] Joe B. Hall was the head basketball coach at Kentucky from 1972 to 1985. Although he had been an assistant at Kentucky since 1965, Coach Hall was given a difficult task: to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor, Adolph Rupp. In the 1978 NCAA tournament, he coached the Wildcats to their fifth NCAA championship. He was named National Coach of the Year in 1978 and SEC Coach of the Year on four occasions. His record at UK was 297–100, and 373–156 over his career. Coach Hall won the title once in 1978, as well as making the final four in 1975 and 1984, and the elite eight in 1972, 1973, 1977, 1983.[citation needed] Coach Hall is one of only three men to both play on an NCAA championship team (1949– Kentucky) and coach an NCAA championship team (1978– Kentucky), and the only one to do so for the same school.[citation needed] The only others to achieve this feat are: After a year of playing in the freshman league and a disappointing sophomore season, Hall's Super Kittens returned with hopes of finally bringing Kentucky its fifth title. They nearly did just that, guiding Kentucky to a runner-up finish to UCLA in the 1975 NCAA tournament but not before avenging their 20-point defeat to an undefeated Indiana team. Despite losing in the championship game, it would give freshman Jack Givens a taste for success that would help propel Kentucky to the title three years later. It had been 20 years without a championship in Lexington, and along with pressure of following a hall of fame coach, Hall would nickname the 1978 season the \"Season Without Celebration.\" The pressure to win was immense on both players and coach to bring home the title, especially with a senior laden team that had gone to the finals as freshmen. Kentucky would hardly lose its composure all season or break under pressure, winning 30 of 32 games and defeating eight ranked teams along the way. By the time Kentucky reached the tournament finals they seemed bound to win the title, though Duke would give Kentucky their all. With the help of senior Jack \"Goose\" Givens' 41 points, Kentucky defeated the Blue Devils 94–88, and finally won their fifth title and first in 20 years. In 1985, Eddie Sutton succeeded Joe B. Hall. He coached the Wildcats for four years, leading them to the Elite Eight of the 1986 NCAA tournament. Two seasons later, Sutton and the 25–5 Wildcats captured their 37th SEC title and were ranked as the 6th college basketball team in the nation by the Associated Press and UPI[31][32] before losing to Villanova in the Tournament. Kentucky entered the 1988–89 season with a gutted roster. Ed Davender, Robert Lock and Winston Bennett had all graduated from school, while All-SEC sophomore Rex Chapman left school early to enter the 1988 NBA draft. Additionally, sophomore standout Eric Manuel was suspected of cheating on his college entrance exam and voluntarily agreed to sit out until the investigation was finished. Potential franchise recruit Shawn Kemp transferred out of Kentucky after signing with the school early that year.[33] Unfortunately, Manuel was forced to sit out the entire season as the investigation dragged on, essentially leaving the Wildcats in the hands of inexperienced sophomore LeRon Ellis and true freshman Chris Mills. The two underclassmen struggled to fill the talent vacuum on the court and the Wildcats finished with a losing record of 13–19, the team's first losing full-season record since 1927.[32] To add insult to injury, the NCAA announced at the end of the season that its investigation into the basketball program had found the school guilty of violating numerous NCAA policies.[34] The scandal broke when Emery Worldwide employees claimed to have discovered $1,000 in cash in an envelope Kentucky assistant coach Dwane Casey sent to Mills' father.[35] Later Emery settled a libel lawsuit filed by Casey for a substantial amount of money. Casey was not in Lexington when the envelope was supposedly mailed and the father of Mills said they received no money. The NCAA rescinded its show cause order immediately after the settlement of the lawsuit, and Casey's career has flourished as an NBA coach.[36] Another player, Eric Manuel, was alleged to have received improper assistance on his college entrance exams and was banned from NCAA competition. Whether Manuel was directly involved has been questioned.[37] Kentucky was already on probation stemming from allegations of an extensive scheme of payments to recruits, and the NCAA seriously considered hitting the Wildcats with the \"death penalty\", which would have shut down the entire basketball program (as opposed to simply being banned from postseason play) for up to two years. However, school president David Roselle forced Sutton and athletic director Cliff Hagan to resign. The Wildcats were slapped with three years' probation, a two-year ban from postseason play, the vacating of their two NCAA tournament wins in the 1988 season, and a ban from live television in 1989–90.[38][39] In 1989, Rick Pitino left the NBA's New York Knicks and became the coach at a Kentucky program reeling from the aforementioned scandal. Kentucky would be banned from the 1990 and 1991 post season, with the 1990 season suffering a 14–14 record. Kentucky would improve in 1991 with a beavy of home-grown upperclassmen such as Sean Woods, John Pelphrey, Richie Farmer, Deron Feldhaus, and Reggie Hanson along with the talented freshman Jamal Mashburn. Despite their record of 22–6, Kentucky was still banned from the post season and would have to wait another year to see the Unforgettables succeed in the tournament. Beginning with the 1992 season, Kentucky was free of post season bans. Though they lost one more game than last season, this team was most memorable for going to the Elite Eight (for the first time since Sutton's 1986 team) with many returning upperclassmen from Kentucky. The team is also known for playing in what could be considered one of the greatest games in NCAA tournament history against Duke. In this game defending champion Duke were looking to return to the Final Four once again, Kentucky for the first time in almost a decade. The game was hard-fought and physical on both sides all game including Laettner's infamous stomp on Aminu Timberlake, which resulted in a technical. The teams took the lead back and forth until the final minute of the game which resulted in a first buzzer beater shot by Kentucky's Sean Woods to take the lead 103–102, and then Laettner's shot to win the game for the Blue Devils in the final seconds 104–103. This team came to be known as the \"Unforgettables\" for helping put Kentucky back on the path to success in the 1990s and because the team was made up of home grown Kentucky kids. Kentucky returned a junior Mashburn, along with Travis Ford and Tony Delk. They were expected to reach the Final Four for the first time since Joe B. Hall's 1984 team. The expectations were right, as Kentucky would head into the post-season with only 2 losses and a No. 5 ranking. After winning the SEC Tournament once again, Kentucky stormed to the NCAA Final Four to meet up with Michigan's \"Fab Five\" a team of young and highly talented recruits that brought Michigan to the championship game the year before. As talented as Kentucky was they would fail to reach the championship game with a 78–81 overtime loss to the Wolverines. But this would be the just a glimpse of a run Kentucky would have later in the decade. Kentucky started the next season ranked #1 but would underachieve, falling short of the Elite Eight for the only time under Pitino. The highlight of the season was the \"Mardi Gras Miracle\", a game where Kentucky trailed LSU 68–37 with 15:34 left, but outscored them 62–27 over the remainder of regulation to win 99–95.[40] Starting in 1996, Kentucky would put together a string of Final Fours with help from 9 future NBA players. The \"Untouchables\" as they were nicknamed, would only lose twice, to Final Four bound UMass Minutemen (coached by future Kentucky coach John Calipari) and Mississippi State. It was with their overwhelming talent and chemistry that would win Kentucky their sixth national title in the 1996 NCAA tournament, Kentucky's first NCAA championship in 18 years. The following year, Pitino's Kentucky team made it back to the national title game, losing to Arizona in overtime in the finals of the 1997 NCAA tournament. Pitino's fast-paced teams at Kentucky were favorites of the school's fans. It was primarily at Kentucky where he implemented his signature style of full-court pressure defense. By the end of the Pitino era, Kentucky went from banned from the post season to going to three of the last five Final Fours and five of the last six Elite Eights. For this the 1997 team was dubbed the \"Unbelievables\" for taking a team that was not expected much of to return the Wildcats back to the championship game for a second time. Pitino left Kentucky in 1997 to coach the NBA's Boston Celtics, he then went on to coach Kentucky's in-state rival, the University of Louisville. Orlando \"Tubby\" Smith was introduced by UK Athletic Director C.M. Newton as the Wildcats' 20th head coach on May 12, 1997, charged with the unenviable task of replacing popular coach Rick Pitino. The Wildcats were at the top of the basketball world at the time, having won a national title in 1996 and, according to many, missing a second straight title in 1997 by the torn ACL of shooting guard Derek Anderson.[41] (Anderson tore his ACL in January against SEC foe Auburn; Kentucky lost the 1997 title game in overtime to the Arizona Wildcats.) The team Smith inherited sported seven players from the Arizona loss, and five from the 1996 championship team. However, since most of the players who had left after the 1996 and 1997 seasons were high NBA draft picks, his team had the lowest pre-season ranking since Kentucky came off probation in 1991.[42] In his first season at UK, he coached the Wildcats to their seventh NCAA championship, including a come-from-behind victory against Duke in the Elite Eight, and another comeback win against Stanford, then Utah in the Finals. His 1998 National Championship is unique in modern times, as being along with 1985 Villanova the 2nd team in over 20 years to win without a First Team All American or future NBA Lottery Pick (see 1998 NCAA tournament). The 1998 team was also unlike Kentucky's past two championship teams, often falling behind in games before roaring back to win rather than dominating their competition. Smith's teams, known primarily for a ball line defense-oriented slower style of play coined \"Tubbyball\", received mixed reviews among Kentucky fans who have historically enjoyed a faster, higher-scoring style of play under previous coaches. Smith was also under pressure from Kentucky fans to recruit better players. After leading Kentucky to one National Championship in 1998, Kentucky would complete a perfect 16–0 regular season conference record in 2003, win five SEC regular season championships (1998, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2005) and five SEC Tournament titles (1998, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2004). Smith led the Wildcats to six Sweet Sixteen appearances (1998, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005) and four Elite Eight appearances (1998, 1999, 2003, 2005) in his ten seasons. He totaled 100 wins quicker than any other Wildcat coach before him except Hall of Famer Adolph Rupp, reaching the plateau in 130 games (John Calipari subsequently broke this record in 114 games). In 2003, he was named AP College Coach of the Year. In 1998, the reserve guard J.P. Blevins scored 9 points, all on 3-pointers sparking the Wildcats to come back from a 15-point deficit in the first half to upset the number 5 seed, Michigan State 60–58. Averaging only 2.2 points a game all season, Blevins was the unlikely hero for the Wildcats who were 6–4, to give the Spartans who were 8-3 an unlikely upset. Especially since they fell behind 26–11 in the first half.[43] Although Smith compiled an impressive resume during his UK career, he came under considerable pressure from many UK fans, who believed that his failure to achieve even a single Final Four appearance in his last nine seasons was inadequate by UK standards. He was infamously dubbed \"Ten Loss Tubby\" by several disgruntled UK fans. Smith's Final Four drought is the longest of any coach in UK history,[44] although Smith did come just a double-overtime loss short of another Final Four appearance in 2005. On March 22, 2007, Smith resigned his position of UK Head Coach to accept the head coach position at the University of Minnesota.[45] On April 6, 2007, Billy Gillispie was formally announced as the new head coach of the University of Kentucky by UK athletic director Mitch Barnhart. He fielded questions from the media during the press conference held at UK's new practice facility, the Joe Craft Center. He expressed his excitement and joy to be not only considered for the position but to have been given the honor and the opportunity to coach what former UK coach Rick Pitino referred to as the \"Roman Empire\" of college basketball. \"I'm very, very grateful and honored to be here, but we have a lot of work to do.\"[46] Gillispie became only the sixth head coach in the last 76 years at the school.[47] Gillispie's second season again started out rocky in 2008 as the 'Cats fell to Virginia Military Institute in their season opener. The second game of the season saw the Wildcats fall to North Carolina by 19 points. UK rebounded to win 11 of their next 12 games, improving their record to 11–3. On January 4, the Wildcats lost a heart breaker to archrival Louisville 74–71 after a 25 ft. shot by Edgar Sosa with 2.3 seconds remaining in the game. Prior to the shot, UK was down 7 with 38.5 seconds left, and Jodie Meeks was fouled shooting a three, proceeded to make all three free throw shots, Patrick Patterson stole an inbound and passed it to Meeks who laid it in to bring the game to 71–69 with 29.6 left, and then an inbound pass went long and Meeks snatched the pass, drove to the hoop and was fouled, and then made both free throws to tie the game at 71 with 22.9 left. So all in all, UK and Meeks got seven points in about 15 seconds to tie the game.[48] Kentucky disposed of Vanderbilt to win their SEC opener on January 10, 70–60. On January 13, in a road game against Tennessee, Jodie Meeks set a new Kentucky scoring record by dropping 54 points on the Volunteers. This total bested Dan Issel's 39-year-old scoring record by 1 point, and propelled UK to a 90–72 win and 2–0 start in conference play.[49] Kentucky followed up this effort with a 68–45 victory at Georgia, improving to 14–4 on the season. With wins over Auburn and Alabama, Kentucky moved to 5–0 in the SEC. On January 26, UK was ranked in the AP Poll (24th) for the first time since week 1 of the 2007–08 season.[50] UK promptly dropped 3 in a row (to Ole Miss, South Carolina, and Mississippi State) before rebounding at home with a thrilling 68–65 win over Florida. Jodie Meeks scored 23 points in the contest, including the fade-away contested 3-point basket with less than 5 seconds remaining to seal the win for UK. On Valentine's Day Kentucky handily defeated Arkansas at Bud Walton Arena 79–63 behind another strong performance from Meeks. Meeks contributed 45 points and helped UK win despite the absence of Patrick Patterson (sprained ankle). With the win, UK remained tied with South Carolina and Tennessee for 1st in the SEC East at 7–3.[51] Following the win UK completely collapsed, losing 5 of its last 6 games to finish the regular season 19–12 with an 8–8 SEC record. Entering the SEC tournament many felt UK would need to win the championship game to get into the NCAA tournament, but UK was defeated in the second game vs. LSU. With an unimpressive regular season and quick elimination in the SEC tournament, UK did indeed miss the NCAA tournament for the first time in 18 years and instead received an invitation to the NIT tournament where the team was defeated in the quarterfinal round against Notre Dame.[52][53] On March 27, 2009, an 18-minute-long meeting occurred between Billy Gillispie, President Dr. Lee Todd, Jr. and Athletic Director Mitch Barnhart, after which it was announced that Gillispie would not be returning as the head coach the next season. Barnhart stressed the firing was due to more than wins and losses, citing \"philosophical differences\" and \"a clear gap in how the rules and responsibilities overseeing the program are viewed\".[54] On April 1, 2009, John Calipari replaced former head coach Billy Gillispie as the Wildcats head coach. To begin his tenure at the University of Kentucky, John Calipari signed one of the best all time recruiting classes.[55] The class was headlined by four five-star recruits: John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins, Daniel Orton, and Eric Bledsoe.[56] On December 19, 2009, the Wildcats defeated Austin Peay 90–69 extending their record to 11–0, and John Calipari broke Adolph Rupp's record for the most consecutive wins to start a season for a first-year head coach at Kentucky. Kentucky defeated the Drexel Dragons 88–44 on December 21, 2009, to become the first program in college basketball history to claim their 2000th victory.[57] By January 25, 2010, Coach \"Cal\" had the Kentucky Wildcats ranked No. 1 in both the ESPN/Coaches poll and AP poll with a record of 19–0.[58] Calipari helped raise in excess of $1.5 million to aid the country of Haiti during the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. President Barack Obama called the Wildcats to thank them for their relief efforts and wish them luck in their future endeavors. To finish off the 2009–10 regular season, Kentucky won its 44th SEC regular season championship (with a final 14–2 SEC record), and won its 26th SEC tournament championship, beating Mississippi State in the finals. The Wildcats then received a No. 1 seed (their 10th No. 1 seed in history) in the East Regional of the NCAA tournament, where they eventually lost to West Virginia in the Elite Eight. This also marked Kentucky's record 50th NCAA Tournament appearance. In 2011 the Wildcats got off to a good start in the regular season with a record of 12–2, with their only losses being North Carolina away and UConn in the Maui Invitational Finals. Conference play was a different matter, and Kentucky would struggle in the SEC losing 6 out of their 8 away games, all of one were against unranked opponents. To close out the season with a three-game defeat No. 13 Florida, No. 23 Vanderbilt and Tennessee at home for a 22–8 record. The hot streak would continue and Kentucky would win their 27th SEC Tournament Title. This was enough for No. 4 seed on the East regional where they played Princeton in a very close first-round game that ended in a 59–57 victory for the Cats. Knight, Jones and company would exact their revenge in the second round against West Virginia, who knocked off Kentucky in the 2010 tourney. In the Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight they would upset the No. 1 seed Ohio State Buckeyes and No. 2 seed North Carolina Tar Heels on their way to the school's 14th Final Four. They lost in the Final Four to eventual National Champion No. 3 seed UConn 56–55. In the 2011–12 season, Calipari led Kentucky to being 16–0 in SEC regular season play, clinching its 45th SEC regular season championship. The last team to do so in the SEC was the 2002–03 Kentucky Wildcats, and before that, the 1995–96 Kentucky Wildcats. Kentucky's regular season record was 30–1, with its only loss being by one point coming from a 3-pointer buzzer-beater by the Indiana Hoosiers' Christian Watford at Assembly Hall on December 10, 2011. In the SEC Tournament, Kentucky fell to Vanderbilt in the championship game, making its overall record 32–2 going into the NCAA tournament. Kentucky was both selected as the No. 1 seed in the South Region and also the No. 1 seed overall of the entire NCAA Tournament. The Sweet 16 match-up on March 23, 2012, was a rematch against Indiana, in which this time the Wildcats prevailed over the Hoosiers 102–90. On March 25, 2012, Kentucky won the South Regional, setting up a Final Four semifinal with the Louisville Cardinals. Calipari's Wildcats defeated the Cardinals (coached by former Kentucky coach Rick Pitino) by a score of 69–61. This sent Kentucky to the National Championship game against the Kansas Jayhawks, where they defeated Kansas 67–59, winning UK's 8th NCAA championship, along with John Calipari's first NCAA Championship as a head coach. This Kentucky team had a record six players drafted in the 2012 NBA draft, including the first time two teammates have been chosen with the first two picks: Anthony Davis (1st overall), Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (2nd), Terrence Jones (18th), Marquis Teague (29th), Doron Lamb (42nd) and Darius Miller (46th). The 2012–13 season's recruiting class ranked either first or second by various recruiting experts led by top center Nerlens Noel, guard Archie Goodwin, forward Alex Poythress, and four-star center Willie Cauley-Stein. Kentucky also brought in transfer guard Julius Mays, a graduate student who had previously played at Wright State University and North Carolina State. Mays was eligible to play immediately, because UK offered a master's degree program that Wright State did not. However, the only returner that saw significant minutes from the championship squad was back-up power forward Kyle Wiltjer, who averaged 11 minutes per game (Ryan Harrow sat out the previous season after transferring from NC State before the 2011–12 season). Although the team saw the rise of Jarrod Polson in the first game of the season against Maryland, they struggled to close out closer games and play with the will to win that Calipari demands. On February 12, Noel tore his ACL in a loss against Florida. UK was 17–7 including that game, and went 4–5 the remainder of the season, losing all 5 games away from Rupp Arena. The fourth of those losses was against Vanderbilt in the first round of the SEC tournament, and UK missed the NCAA tournament altogether, being the overall No. 1 seed of the NIT. UK was upset by Robert Morris in the first round of the NIT, ending their season with a 21–12 record. In the press conference following the loss to Robert Morris, Calipari stated that his 2013–14 team would be a \"tough, hard-nosed, fighting team.\" Noel and Goodwin both entered the NBA draft and were both taken in the first round at 6th and 29th, respectively. Ryan Harrow transferred to Georgia State to be closer to his father that had suffered from a stroke, and Kyle Wiltjer transferred to Gonzaga. Kentucky brought in the No. 1 recruiting class, featuring a record six McDonald's All-Americans in Julius Randle, Andrew Harrison, Aaron Harrison, James Young, Dakari Johnson, and Marcus Lee, as well as Kentucky natives Derek Willis and Dominique Hawkins, and walk-on E. J. Floreal (son of Edrick Floréal, head coach of UK's track and field team). Alex Poythress and Willie Cauley-Stein did not declare for the 2013 NBA draft, and decided to return for their sophomore seasons. In 2013–14, Kentucky looked to make up for its struggles in the previous season. Despite making the NIT, there were high expectations for this team. The team, however, would be without some of its top players from the 2012–13 team including Nerlens Noel[59] and starting shooting guard Archie Goodwin,[60] who were first-round draft choices in the 2013 NBA draft. Starting power forward Kyle Wiltjer transferred to Gonzaga[61] and starting point guard Ryan Harrow transferred to Georgia State.[62] Returning was former McDonald's All-American Alex Poythress and starting center Willie Cauley-Stein.[60] The poor success of the 2012–13 team did not stop John Calipari from again producing another number one recruiting class. The entering class included a record six McDonald's All-Americans[63] highlighted by Julius Randle and the Harrison Twins from Texas, Aaron and Andrew. Many recruiting analysts and experts proclaimed that the 2013 signing class was the greatest recruiting class since the infamous Fab Five in the 1990s.[64] The team began the season ranked number one in both the AP and Coaches polls.[65][66] The season was full of ups and downs. Early in the season the team experienced close losses to Baylor, Michigan State, and North Carolina. Despite those losses the team was able to defeat in-state rival Louisville. Nothing changed in SEC play for them either. The team ended the regular season losing three of their last four games including once to South Carolina, who finished the season 14–20 overall. The team limped into the SEC tournament unranked, and desperately looking for any answer to their disappointing season. Calipari during his weekly radio call-in show mentioned the team was given a \"tweak\".[67] The \"tweak\" sparked speculation and curiosity among the fans and the media to what it could be. The \"tweak\" was never fully revealed. However, the \"tweak\" caused the team to go on an historic run through both the SEC and NCAA tournaments. UK was the runner-up to number one Florida in the SEC Tournament. During the NCAA tournament UK became the first team in history to eliminate three teams from the previous Final Four (Wichita State, Louisville, Michigan). UK was the National Runner-up after losing to Connecticut in the national championship game. After the 2014 season, Kentucky only lost Julius Randle and James Young to the NBA draft.[68][69] The returning players consisted of a record-tying nine McDonald's All-Americans. Juniors Cauley-Stein and Poythress returned with sophomores Aaron and Andrew Harrison, Johnson, and Lee to join the No. 2 ranked 2015 recruiting class which was highlighted of Gatorade Player of the Year Karl-Anthony Towns for the 2015 season.[70] The team began its season in the Bahamas on a six-game tour against international clubs and teams.[71] While in the Bahamas the team established a \"platoon system\" which featured two groups of five players that would rotate every four minutes within the game.[72] The \"platoon system\" was put on display nationally in a 72–40 victory over No. 5 Kansas in the Champions Classic in November.[73] In December, the team defeated UCLA 83–44. Kentucky led 41–7 at halftime, the lowest UCLA point total for a half in its storied history.[74] The SEC regular season began with two overtime victories over Ole Miss and Texas A&M, the closest games Kentucky would play all season. Kentucky finished the regular season with a perfect 31–0 record, the best start in school history.[75] In the SEC tournament, the team won each game by double digits, including a 78–63 victory over Arkansas in the finals. Cauley-Stein was named the MVP of the Tournament. In the NCAA tournament Kentucky played its first two games at the KFC Yum! Center in Louisville. Prior to the regional semifinal against West Virginia, Mountaineers guard Daxter Miles proclaimed that Kentucky would be 36–1 after the game. The comment fueled the team as they defeated West Virginia 78–39, tying the largest margin of victory in the Sweet 16 in NCAA Tournament history.[76] In the regional final Kentucky narrowly defeated Notre Dame 68–66. The only loss of the season was in the Final Four to Wisconsin, who Kentucky defeated the previous season in the Final Four. The 2014–15 team tied the NCAA record for most wins in a season (38).[77] After the season Cauley-Stein and Towns were named consensus All-Americans among other awards received. The Kentucky Wildcats represented USA Basketball, at Globl Jam 2023, and defeated Canada to win the gold medal. Following a first round upset as a 2 seed in the 2024 NCAA Tournament, John Calipari resigned his position of Head Coach to accept the same role at the University of Arkansas. He was officially announced as the Razorbacks Head Coach on April 10, 2024, marking the end of his storied tenure at Kentucky. On April 12, 2024, Kentucky hired BYU head coach Mark Pope for the same position in Lexington,[78] days after Calipari left for the vacant head coaching post at Arkansas.[79] Pope was a member of the Wildcats' 1995-1996 team that won the NCAA Tournament. The Wildcats have had 23 coaches in their 112-year history. Mark Pope is the current head coach. Six Wildcats coaches have won the National Coach-of-the-Year award: Adolph Rupp in 1950, 1954, 1959, 1966, and 1970, Joe B. Hall in 1978, Eddie Sutton in 1986, Rick Pitino in 1990 and 1992, Tubby Smith in 1998, 2003, and 2005, and John Calipari in 2012 and 2015. Additionally, seven Wildcats coaches have been named Southeastern Conference Coach-of-the-Year: Adolph Rupp in 1964, 1966, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971 and 1972, Joe B. Hall in 1973, 1975, 1978 and 1983, Eddie Sutton in 1986, Rick Pitino in 1990, 1991 and 1996, Tubby Smith in 1998, 2003, and 2005, Billy Gillispie in 2008, and John Calipari in 2010, 2012, and 2015.[80] The following is a list of Kentucky's 8 National Championships: The NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition. The * represents overall number one seed which began with the 2004 Tournament. Kentucky has 42 men's basketball players, coaches, and contributors honored in Rupp Arena with banners representing their numbers hung from the rafters. Due to the number of players honored, the fact that several of them have shared numbers, the numbers are not officially retired. Some of the jersey numbers were before the NCAA rule change before the 1957–58 season that outlawed teams wearing jerseys with a number higher than 5 on it that was not changed until 2023.[81] To have a banner hung, the individual must be elected to the UK Athletics Hall of Fame.[82] The following Kentucky players, coaches, and contributors have been enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. The following Kentucky players and coaches have represented their country in basketball in the Summer Olympic Games: The Kentucky Wildcats presently play their home games in 20,545-seat Rupp Arena. When it opened in 1976, it was the largest arena in the United States built specifically for basketball, and retained that status for much of the following 40-plus years. It was opened in 1976 and is named after legendary Kentucky head coach Adolph Rupp. Located off-campus, in downtown Lexington, the facility's official capacity was 23,500+[89] until a renovation project in the 2019 offseason reduced the capacity to 20,545.[90] The Wildcats have consistently led the country in home attendance since the 1976–77 season (when Rupp Arena first opened), winning the National Attendance Title a record 25 times, including 17 of the past 20 seasons, and 8 of the last 10 seasons. Kentucky also has an impressive 529–64 (.892) all-time record in Rupp Arena.[91] In 2007, the university unveiled the Joe Craft Center, a state-of-the-art basketball practice facility and athletics office building attached to the north side of Memorial Coliseum on the \"Avenue of Champions\" at the University of Kentucky campus in Lexington, Kentucky.[91] The 102,000 ft2 structure contains separate practice courts for the men's and women's basketball programs, separate men's and women's locker rooms, state-of-the-art video rooms for game film viewing, new coaches offices, a ticket office, and athletic administration offices.[92] As a result, Memorial Coliseum has more ample space for volleyball and gymnastics practice and games. The facility is named after businessman and philanthropist Joe Craft, a Hazard, Kentucky native, who pledged $6 million towards the completion of the $30 million project.[92][93] Coming off back-to-back national championships, the team moved to Memorial Coliseum in 1950. Nicknamed \"The House That Rupp Built\", the multipurpose facility cost $4 million and seated 12,000 people. It also housed a swimming pool, physical education equipment, and offices for the athletics staff. The team occupied Memorial Coliseum for twenty-six seasons, and sold out all 345 home games they played there during that period. Kentucky also played a 2009 NIT game at Memorial Coliseum due to Rupp Arena being booked. The Wildcats are 307–38 (.890) all-time at Memorial Coliseum.[89][91][94] Today, Memorial Coliseum is home to three UK women's teams—basketball, gymnastics, and volleyball. In 1924, Alumni Gymnasium was completed. It included seating for 2,800 people and cost $92,000 to construct.[95] Kentucky played 271 games at Alumni Gymnasium from 1924 to 1950, going 247–24 (.911).[91][96] After a major renovation completed in 2018, it is now a student recreation facility known as Alumni Gym Fitness Center.[97] Woodland Park Auditorium, opened in 1906 and closed in 1941, was located on the corner of East High Street and Kentucky Avenue in Lexington, Kentucky. Kentucky used this facility for home games during World War I between 1914 and 1916 going 15–7 there all-time.[91][98] The Wildcats played 84 home games at Buell Armory Gymnasium from 1910 to 1924. It was named for Union Civil War General Don Carlos Buell who was a member of the first board of trustees at Kentucky.[99] The armory was also used during World War I to teach truck maintenance and repair among other skills.[100] Kentucky was 59–25 all-time at Buell Armory Gymnasium.[101] The first home court for the Wildcats was simply called \"The Gymnasium\" or State College Gymnasium until 1910. It was located in the north wing of Barker Hall on the university campus. Constructed in 1902, it also housed the university's physical education classes until 1909. The facility had a capacity of 650 people, and with no bleachers or seats, fans had to stand to watch the games that were played there.[95] By the 1920s, it had become clear that \"The Gymnasium\" (by then renamed \"The Ladies' Gym\") was inadequate to house the university's basketball team. Records show Kentucky was 17–14 at State College Gymnasium.[91][100][102] (Of the 71 major categories listed above, Kentucky is No. 1 in 50 of them, No. 2 in 16 of them, No. No. 3 in 3 of them, No. 4 in 1 of them, and No. 8 in 1 of them.) Kentucky can also lay claim to several individual achievements for both players and coaches: Kentucky also holds several other NCAA records and various additional accomplishments:",

                "title": "Chelsea (given name) - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Chelsea is an English given name derived from the Old English place name ċealc hȳð,[1] or the modern Celcyth, meaning chalk landing place. The name evolved to Chelsea, a location on the River Thames that became a London borough known for its wealthy, socially influential residents. Many locations have been named after the English place name Chelsea.[2] The given name, a transferred use of the place name, was in use for boys in the New England region of the United States by the late 18th century and was first used for American girls in the 1840s.[2] The name was first popularized for girls in larger numbers in the United States by American comedian Chelsea Brown, who was born Lois Brown but chose Chelsea as a stage name. After Brown began appearing on the American television program Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In in 1968, the name quadrupled in use for American girls to 48 uses that year. The name debuted among the 1,000 most popular names for American girls in 1969, in 702nd place. Chelsea Morning, a 1969 hit song written about mornings in Chelsea, Manhattan by Canadian singer Joni Mitchell and later performed by Judy Collins, further popularized the name for girls with its descriptive lyrics such as \"the light poured in like butterscotch.\"[2] The name of Chelsea Clinton, daughter of American President Bill Clinton and former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, was inspired by the song when she was born in 1980. The name Chelsea increased further in popularity in the 1980s due to its use for film and television characters, such as Chelsea Thayer Wayne, a character played by Jane Fonda in the 1981 American film On Golden Pond and Chelsea Reardon, a character played by Kassie DePaiva on the American soap opera Guiding Light beginning in 1986. In 1992, the name reached peak popularity in the United States and would have been the eighth most popular name for American girls in that year if all spellings of the name were combined. The name dramatically declined in use in 1993, during the first year of Bill Clinton's presidency. At the time, it was out of fashion in the United States to name children after politicians and those who were associated with them. The name has continued to decline in use, but remained among the 1,000 most popular names for American girls in 2023.[2] Spelling variants in use in the United States include Chelsey, Chelsi, Chelsie, and Chelsy.[2] The name has also been in regular use throughout the Anglosphere, including Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, as well as in Belgium, France and Netherlands.[3]",

The name was used most in 1992, when it was at #15 in the United States on the USA Social Security Administration baby naming chart.[3] The name might come from the Old English language and mean \"chalk landing place\".

                "title": "Tennessee Volunteers basketball - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Tennessee Volunteers men's basketball team is the collegiate men's basketball program for the University of Tennessee–Knoxville. The Volunteers (commonly referred to as the \"Vols\") compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The Volunteers play their home games in Thompson–Boling Arena, on a court nicknamed \"the Summitt\", after former Tennessee Lady Vols basketball coach Pat Summitt. With a current capacity of 21,678 (formerly 24,535), Tennessee has consistently ranked in the top 15 in the nation in terms of volume of attendance, averaging 14,817 (60.39% capacity) attendance from 1988 through 2006, and averaging 17,194 (79.34% capacity) attendance from 2007 through 2018 after reducing seating capacity prior to the 2007 season.[2][3] Historically, Tennessee ranks third in the SEC in all-time wins.[4] Many notable players have played collegiately at Tennessee—players such as Bernard King, Dale Ellis, Allan Houston, Tobias Harris, Grant Williams, and Dalton Knecht who all play(ed) in the NBA. Chris Lofton, Ron Slay, Tyler Smith, and John Fulkerson are also notable players who later played professionally in other leagues. The Volunteers are currently coached by Rick Barnes, who was hired on March 31, 2015, to replace Donnie Tyndall. In 1963, the University of Tennessee hired Ray Mears to become the head coach of the men's basketball program. The hiring of Mears, who was coming off an NCAA small college championship at Wittenberg University, ushered in the most sustained period of success in Tennessee men's basketball history. In his first year, Mears's Volunteers improved from a 4–19 record in 1962 to 13–11, highlighted by two wins over the Kentucky Wildcats. Before Mears, Tennessee had only beaten the Wildcats twice in 39 meetings. Throughout his career, Mears gained notoriety throughout the SEC for frequently being a thorn in the powerhouse Kentucky's side.[citation needed] In an era where Kentucky was coached by future College Basketball Hall of Fame members Adolph Rupp and Joe B. Hall, winning 75% of their games, Mears recorded a 15–15 record against the Wildcats. Led by A. W. Davis, the Volunteers finished second in the SEC in each of the next two seasons and recorded 20 wins in 1965, reaching that mark for the first time in 17 years. This success and the resultant growing fan support led to the university's decision to expand the 7,500-seat Amory-Fieldhouse to 12,700 seats. It was renamed Stokely Athletic Center to honor William B. Stokely, whose donation funded the renovation. In the expanded Stokely Center's inaugural season, the Volunteers captured the 1967 SEC championship and made the program's first-ever NCAA tournament appearance. Dubbed the \"Fearless Five,\" the 1967 team won road games against top conference teams Florida, Kentucky, and Mississippi State. The win over Mississippi State, coming in double-overtime on a pair of Bill Justus free throws, secured Tennessee's first SEC championship in 24 years and is referred to by some as the greatest basketball game in Tennessee history.[citation needed] From 1968 to 1973, Mears kept Tennessee among the top teams of the SEC, winning a second SEC championship in 1972 and finishing second in every year except 1970. In 1974, Mears and his trusted assistant Stu Aberdeen were able to recruit New York City standout forward Ernie Grunfeld to Knoxville. In his freshman season, Grunfeld led the team in scoring, averaging 17.4 points per game, and received first-team All-SEC honors. The following season, Grunfeld was joined by fellow New Yorker Bernard King. Known as \"The Ernie and Bernie Show,\" King and Grunfeld led the Volunteers to a 61–20 record over three years and an SEC championship in 1977. During their three years together, Tennessee posted a 5–1 record against Kentucky. The Volunteers reached the National Invitation Tournament in 1975 and the NCAA tournament in 1976 and 1977. King was named first-team All-American and SEC Player of the Year in 1975 and 1976, and then shared the honor with Grunfeld in 1977, with both being named SEC Co-Player of the Year. Grunfeld graduated from Tennessee in 1977 and King chose to forgo his senior year to enter the NBA draft. King was drafted 7th overall to the New Jersey Nets and Grunfeld went 11th overall to the Milwaukee Bucks. Both enjoyed long and illustrious NBA careers. Perhaps the biggest impact of the \"Ernie and Bernie\" show was how it changed the national perception of the Tennessee basketball program.[citation needed] This \"Double Trouble from Tennessee\" was featured in the February 1976 edition of Sports Illustrated.[5] In 2013, ESPN premiered a 30 for 30 documentary called \"Bernie and Ernie\" about the all-time great Volunteer basketball players. Following the exit of his two biggest stars, Mears, who long struggled with depression,[6] was not able to coach the team in 1978. Under the watch of interim coach Cliff Wettig, the Volunteers struggled to an 11–16 record, and Mears officially retired for health reasons after the season.[7] Mears is remembered not only as the greatest coach in Tennessee men's basketball history, but also as a great entertainer and marketer.[citation needed] From the beginning of his time at Tennessee, Mears employed marketing tactics to get fans to games—from his patented and provocative orange blazer, to his introduction of the Pride of the Southland Band to basketball games, to his entertaining pre-game warmups that compared to the Harlem Globetrotters for creativity.[8] At the beginning of his tenure, Mears declared, \"This is Big Orange Country,\" and this slogan has lived on long past his coaching years.[9] Don DeVoe was named Mears's successor and took over as head coach for the 1979 season. Despite the losing record in 1978, DeVoe inherited a roster centered on All-American center Reggie Johnson. DeVoe's 1979 Volunteers finished the regular season with a 21–12 record, beating Kentucky twice and earning a second-place finish in the SEC. The 1979 SEC tournament was the first held in 27 years, and the Volunteers reached the tournament finals, where they once again defeated Kentucky by a score of 75–69 to win their first SEC Tournament championship since 1943. With the tournament championship win, the Volunteers were invited back to the NCAA tournament, where they recorded the program's first NCAA tournament win with a defeat of Eastern Kentucky. Tennessee was eliminated in the second round with a loss to Notre Dame. DeVoe led Tennessee to the NCAA tournament each of the next five years, but none of his teams advanced past the second round. Through his first seven years at UT, DeVoe compiled an overall record of 143–79 (.644). The program's momentum under his direction eventually weakened, however, and the Volunteers were not invited to the NCAA tournament or the NIT in 1986 or 1987. Entering the 1989 season, DeVoe's 11th year at Tennessee, his teams had not reached the NCAA tournament or finished above 6th in the SEC since 1983. DeVoe led the Volunteers to a 19–11 record and a berth in the NCAA tournament. After an 84–68 loss to West Virginia in the first round, DeVoe resigned. The growth of UT basketball under DeVoe is still seen today in the Vols' current home arena, Thompson–Boling Arena, which was built during his tenure. By the mid-1980s, the overflow crowds had grown too large for the 12,700-seat Stokley Athletic Center. In 1988, the Volunteers moved to the new $30 million Thompson–Boling Arena, which seated over 24,500 people—at the time, the largest facility ever built specifically for basketball in the United States. Sitting on the banks of the Tennessee River nearby historic Neyland Stadium, the arena has accommodated 21,678 people since a 2007 renovation. In 1990, Wade Houston, an Alcoa, Tennessee native and former assistant coach at Louisville, became the first African-American head coach in Tennessee and SEC history. Houston's son, Allan Houston, came to UT to play for his father and would become one of the most accomplished players in Tennessee history. With 2801 points, Allan Houston finished his career as Tennessee's all-time leading scorer and was named All-American in 1992 and 1993. Houston was fired after a 5–22 campaign in 1994, finishing the worst season in Tennessee history. None of his teams reached the NCAA tournament, and only two of his teams received invitations to the NIT, the two of which were also his only teams to finish with winning records. Houston finished with an overall record of 65–90 at Tennessee. Houston was replaced by Kevin O'Neill in 1995. O'Neill—an intense and somewhat high-strung sideline coach, but also a skilled recruiter[citation needed]—took over a program depleted in talent. He was able to sign talented players such as Brandon Wharton, Tony Harris, and Isiah Victor. O'Neill left Tennessee to become the head coach at Northwestern after the 1997 season. O'Neill was replaced by Oregon Ducks head coach Jerry Green. Green inherited a roster with significant young talent and was able to an immediate improvement in on-court success. His first Tennessee team produced a 20–9 overall record—a nine-win improvement over the 11–16 record of O'Neill's third and final UT team—and advanced to the 1998 NCAA tournament. In his second year, Green's Volunteers won the 1999 SEC East Division championship and defeated Kentucky twice in the same season for the first time since 1979, in what is generally regarded to be the best overall year in school athletics history. (The 1998 Tennessee Football team finished 13–0 and won the first-ever BCS National Championship. In women's basketball, Pat Summitt led the Lady Volunteers to a 39–0 NCAA championship season, the program's third consecutive national title.) The 2000 Tennessee men's basketball team finished 26–7, repeating as SEC East champions, winning the Volunteers' first SEC championship since 1982, and setting a program record for most wins in a single season. In the NCAA tournament, the Volunteers advanced to the first Sweet Sixteen in school history, where they lost a close contest to North Carolina. Green's Volunteers began the 2001 season with a 16–1 record, rising to No. 4 in the AP Poll. Beginning with a ten-point loss at Kentucky in mid-January, Tennessee then struggled to a 22–11 finish. Green's team advanced to the NCAA tournament—the fourth appearance in Green's four seasons—losing in the first round. Coupled with his multiple incidents with local media and Tennessee fans,[10] this disappointing finish to the season led to Green's resignation. He was replaced by Buzz Peterson, who failed to lead the program to an NCAA tournament berth in his four years as head coach. He was fired after the 2005 season, in which his team finished 14–17. After taking Wisconsin–Milwaukee to a Sweet Sixteen in 2005, Bruce Pearl was hired as the new Tennessee men's basketball coach. Pearl's assistants Tony Jones, Steve Forbes, Jacob Nichols, Jason Shay, and Ken Johnson were part of a staff that would help to lead the Volunteers to the NCAA tournament six years in a row. Pearl inherited a roster that had not experienced much winning, but showed promise with future NBA senior point guard C. J. Watson and All-SEC freshman team shooting guard Chris Lofton. Pearl's coaching, which included playing an up-tempo style and pressing defense, led to immediate gains for Tennessee. In his first season, Pearl led the Volunteers to a 22–8 record, an SEC East Division championship, and a no. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament. Pearl's first team achieved some of the more memorable wins in program history, including two wins against the eventual national champion Florida Gators. Another memorable win came when Chris Lofton, who is a Kentucky native, led the Volunteers over Kentucky in Rupp Arena for the program's first win there since 1999. Pearl's 2006 recruiting class was ranked among the top ten in college basketball.[11] Despite the influx of freshmen and their inexperience, the Volunteers were able to open with a 13–2 start to the season. All-American guard Chris Lofton was injured and missed a good portion of January and early February, during which time the Volunteers opened 3–5 in SEC play. After Lofton returned, Tennessee won 7 out of their last 8 regular season games. Given a no. 5 seed, the Volunteers returned to the Sweet Sixteen where they faced no. 1 seed Ohio State. Tennessee led 49–32 at halftime, but the eventual NCAA runner-up Buckeyes mounted a comeback to defeat the Volunteers by a score of 85–84. During the 2006–07 season, the Volunteers were ranked 4th nationally in attendance, with an average of 19,661 fans in Thompson–Boling Arena, which has a capacity of 21,758. This marked an increase in attendance of an average of 7,436 per game since Pearl arrived in March 2005.[citation needed] Preseason expectations for the Volunteers were high entering the 2008 season.[12] Chris Lofton was a preseason pick by some to win National Player of the Year, and he was joined by Tyler Smith, an All-Big Ten freshman transfer from Iowa. Senior guards JaJuan Smith and Jordan Howell, along with rising sophomores Wayne Chism and Ramar Smith, propelled the Volunteers to a preseason no. 7 ranking. The team posted a record of 28–3 in the regular season. The season was highlighted by the rivalry matchup between Tennessee and Memphis. John Calipari's Tigers were undefeated and ranked no. 1 and the Volunteers were no. 2. In front the largest TV audience to date to ever watch a game on ESPN, the two teams remained evenly matched for thirty-nine minutes. The Volunteers trailed 61–60 with 30 seconds left before Tyler Smith made a jump-shot to give UT the lead. The Volunteers added three free throws and took the contest by a score of 66–62. The following Monday, Tennessee was ranked no. 1 in polls for the first time in school history. The Volunteers finished the regular season as the outright SEC champions and the no. 1 seed for the SEC Tournament in Atlanta. The Volunteers won their first game to set up a semifinal matchup against Arkansas in the Georgia Dome. The night before the game, an EF2 tornado hit Downtown Atlanta, damaging the Georgia Dome and much of the surrounding area. Because of this, the tournament was nearly canceled but was ultimately moved to Georgia Tech's Alexander Memorial Coliseum. The Razorbacks were able to upset the Volunteers, denying them a place in the final and a shot at their first SEC Tournament championship in 30 years. The Volunteers received a no. 2 seed in the NCAA tournament. They advanced to the Sweet Sixteen, where they lost to the Louisville Cardinals men's basketball. Despite the disappointing ending, the 2008 season is remembered as one of the best in program history. Replacing Chris Lofton proved a difficult task in the 2009 season. Now led by Tyler Smith, the Volunteers finished with a 21–13 record. However, Tennessee claimed another SEC division championship. The Volunteers advanced to the SEC Tournament Championship in Tampa before losing to Mississippi State 64–61. The Volunteers lost their NCAA tournament first-round game to Oklahoma State. Entering the regular season ranked in the top 10, the Volunteers started the season 10–2. On New Year's Day, players Melvin Goins, Cam Tatum, Brian Williams, and leading scorer Tyler Smith were arrested after a traffic stop when police found marijuana and an illegal firearm.[13] The players were all suspended for multiple games and Tyler Smith was eventually dismissed from the team.[14] After the suspensions, the Volunteers were left with only six scholarship players. The Volunteers defeated Charlotte and then hosted no. 1 Kansas the next game. In front of a sellout crowd, the undermanned Volunteers defeated the Jayhawks 76–68. Tennessee cemented its lead with a shot clock-beating three-point shot with under a minute left by local freshman walk-on Skylar McBee, who entered the rotation due to the suspensions. Tennessee rode the momentum of the Kansas upset to a 23–7 regular season record. This included another upset of second-ranked Kentucky, which featured future NBA All-Stars John Wall and DeMarcus Cousins, as well as four other eventual NBA players. The Volunteers won 74–65 at home in front of a raucous crowd. The Wildcats were able to avenge the loss a week and half later in the SEC Tournament. As a no. 6 seed in a bracket featuring overall top seed Kansas, the Volunteers defeated a Steve Fisher-coached San Diego State team with Kawhi Leonard in the first round. No. 14 seed Ohio upset the no. 3 seed Georgetown Hoyas, setting up a matchup between the Volunteers and the Bobcats in the following round. After winning 83–68, Tennessee advanced to Bruce Pearl's third Sweet Sixteen in five years. In a rematch of the 2007 Sweet Sixteen, the Volunteers faced the Ohio State Buckeyes at the Edward Jones Dome in St. Louis. In a back and forth battle with the Evan Turner-led Buckeyes, Tennessee held a 76–73 lead with 13 seconds left. Turner missed a three-point shot, rebounded his own missed shot, and attempted a final three-point shot that was blocked by J. P. Prince, securing the Volunteers an appearance in the Elite Eight for the first time in program history. Tennessee faced Michigan State in the Elite Eight. After a fast start, the Vols sputtered in the second half and Michigan State was able to keep the game close. Down by one point with 11 seconds left, Tennessee's Scotty Hopson was set to attempt two free throws. He made the first but missed the second. With the score tied, Michigan State advanced the ball and was fouled on a fast break. Raymar Morgan made one of two free throws, and Michigan State was able to defeat Tennessee one game short of the Final Four. Tennessee opened the 2010–11 season with success, winning the Preseason NIT and rising as high as no. 7 in the national polls. In mid-December, the NCAA announced an investigation into Bruce Pearl for his role in a possible recruiting violation.[citation needed] SEC Commissioner Mike Slive suspended Pearl for the first half of the SEC season.[15] Tennessee faltered throughout the rest of the season to a 19–15 record. Tennessee appeared in the NCAA tournament for the sixth consecutive year under Pearl and faced Michigan in the opening round. The Volunteers were defeated 75–45 in what proved to be Pearl's last game. On March 21, 2011, the week after the loss, the university announced the firing of Pearl, based on Pearl's misconduct of lying to the NCAA in the ongoing investigation.[16] Pearl was eventually given a three-year show-cause penalty. On March 27, 2011, the University of Tennessee announced the hiring of Cuonzo Martin as the Volunteers' 18th head coach. Martin had spent the prior three seasons at Missouri State, where he compiled a record of 61–41. Martin was able to lead the Missouri State team from an 11–20 record and a last-place finish in the Missouri Valley Conference to a 26–9 record and a first-place conference finish. Martin took over a depleted roster with low expectations. After the departure of Tobias Harris following his freshman season, the Volunteers were picked to finish near the bottom of the SEC in 2011–12.[citation needed] With the emergence of Jordan McRae and Jeronne Maymon, and the mid-season addition of Jarnell Stokes, Martin took a team that had lost their top three—and seven of their top ten—contributors from the previous season to a second-place finish in the SEC, largely because of their tough defense and lack of turnovers. With an outside chance at the NCAA tournament, the Volunteers lost their first SEC tournament game to Ole Miss, ending their NCAA chances. They played in the NIT before losing in the second round. In 2012–13, the Volunteers started off slowly, posting an 11–10 record before finishing the regular season 8–1. UT was eliminated in the second round of the SEC Tournament and was left out of the NCAA tournament for the second straight year, finishing as one of the last teams out.[citation needed] Expectations were high heading into 2013–14 with a roster many felt could compete for a Sweet Sixteen appearance.[citation needed] However, the fans quickly grew vocally upset after another slow start of 16–11. A petition with thousands of signatures surfaced online for the firing of Cuonzo Martin and the re-hiring of Bruce Pearl, whose show-cause order was ending the next year.[citation needed] Whether the petition motivated the team or not, the Volunteers finished the season 5–1 and earned a place in the \"First Four\" round of the NCAA tournament. They defeated Iowa in the play-in game in Dayton, Ohio to move on to face the UMass Minutemen. Martin's Volunteers, who were the lower seed, were favored by many and easily defeated UMass. In one of the biggest upsets in tournament history, Mercer upset Duke, and the Volunteers went on to defeat Mercer to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. Tennessee then played Michigan in Indianapolis. In front of one of the largest crowds to witness a Sweet Sixteen game, the Volunteers' comeback fell short and UT lost to Michigan by a score of 73–71. Martin resigned from Tennessee and accepted the coaching job at California on April 15, 2014.[17] After a brief coaching search, Tennessee athletics director Dave Hart announced on April 21, 2014 that former Morehead State and Southern Mississippi head coach Donnie Tyndall would become the next head coach of the Tennessee Volunteers.[18] Tyndall inherited a roster that returned one contributing player from the previous year. Also, due to Jarnell Stokes's decision to enter the NBA draft and two other players transferring, Tyndall had to recruit and sign nearly one-third of the 2015 team's roster in less than a month. Under these circumstances, he led the 2015 team to a 16–16 record. After the season was over, Tennessee announced it was firing Tyndall with cause after it learned that he had lied to both UT and the NCAA about the severity of major NCAA violations that had occurred at Southern Miss.[19] Hart said that he would have never hired Tyndall had the true extent of the violations been known. By this time, it was clear that Tyndall would face severe penalties for his role in the violations, including a suspension for part of the season. According to ESPN, Hart and other officials were still smarting from Pearl having to sit out the first half of conference play three years earlier, and were not willing to face the prospect of an equally lengthy suspension for Tyndall.[20] While searching for its third basketball coach in four years, Tennessee sought to make a hire that would bring much-needed stability to the program.[citation needed] During the search process, news broke that Texas had fired their head coach of 17 years, Rick Barnes. Barnes, who had a prior connection to Tennessee athletics director Dave Hart, quickly surfaced as the frontrunner for the job.[citation needed] On March 31, 2015, Barnes was named the new Tennessee men's basketball coach. Barnes boasts the best record of any coach in school history, with an overall record of 604–314 from his previous tenures at Texas, Clemson, and Providence. Barnes is originally from nearby Hickory, North Carolina, and his wife, Candy, graduated from Tennessee in 1975.[21] The Rick Barnes era began on a winning note as Tennessee defeated UNC Asheville, 82–78 in Barnes' debut game at UT. In Barnes' third year as Tennessee's coach he completed quite the turnaround from the previous year's 16–16 (8–10) team, as his team would finish the regular season 26–9 (13–5) and capture a share of the SEC regular season title. This would be Tennessee's first regular season title since 2008 and tenth overall.[22] Tennessee also reached the SEC men's basketball championship final where they were defeated by Kentucky 77–72. In 2019, Tennessee experienced their best season record wise under Barnes. The Volunteers would earn a record of 31–6 (15–3) including an 18-game win streak and a no.1 ranking in the polls for the first time since the 2007–08 season. The Volunteers again reached the SEC men's basketball championship final where they were defeated by Auburn 84–64. The Volunteers proceeded to earn a #2 seed in the 2019 NCAA tournament, where they defeated Colgate 77–70 in the first round.[23] Tennessee overcame a resurgent Iowa Hawkeyes team in the second round by a score of 83–77 in an overtime thriller. The Volunteers fell to Purdue in the Sweet Sixteen in overtime after a thrilling come-from-behind run led by Volunteer guard Admiral Schofield. Purdue's Ryan Cline kept the Boilermakers in the game late and after a controversial call on Lamonte Turner, the Vols lost. Junior forward Grant Williams captured the 2018–19 SEC player of the year award, his second consecutive year obtaining the honor.[24] Source[25][26][27] National champion Postseason invitational champion Conference regular season champion Conference regular season and conference tournament champion Division regular season champion Division regular season and conference tournament champion Conference tournament champion Tennessee plays its home games in Thompson–Boling Arena, which was at one time the largest facility ever built specifically for basketball in the United States, with a seating capacity of 24,678 until its 2007 renovation. Named for the late B. Ray Thompson and former UT President Dr. Edward J. Boling, the arena regularly hosts women's volleyball matches, concerts, camps, conferences, and other special events throughout the year. Thompson–Boling Arena opened during the 1987–88 season, with Tennessee defeating Marquette 82–56 before a crowd of 25,272. In its opening season, the Volunteers finished third nationally in attendance, with an average attendance of more than 20,000 fans per game. Much of the facility's storied history has centered on men's and women's basketball. In the last two decades, the Volunteers and Lady Volunteers have hosted record college basketball crowds, as well as WNBA and NCAA tournament basketball games. The Volunteers have ranked fourth in the nation in average home attendance for each of the past three seasons, including an average of 20,483 fans per game in 2008–09. Tennessee's 1989 men's game against Kentucky set the SEC regular-season record with a crowd of 25,610. The Lady Volunteers drew 24,597 fans for their 1998 game with Connecticut to establish a women's NCAA record, while a Celtics-Bullets game in 1988 attracted a then-NBA-record exhibition crowd of 23,611. The arena's largest basketball crowd since its capacity was reduced to 21,678 prior to the 2007–08 season came on January 7, 2009, when the Vols hosted Gonzaga in front of a sellout crowd of 22,326. UT hosted the NCAA tournament's South Regional Finals in 1994 and 1999 in the spacious facility, as well as the 1990 NCAA Southeast Region's first- and second-round games and the NCAA women's 1990 Final Four. The 1989 SEC Tournament was the first of what promised to be many postseason tournaments to be held in Thompson–Boling Arena. The riverfront arena has drawn rave reviews from teams, administrators, and media for its modern facilities needed for hosting major tournaments. The Volunteers have appeared in the NCAA tournament 26 times. Their combined record is 28–27. The Volunteers have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 13 times. Their combined record is 13–13. †: First Team All-American Tennessee has retired five jersey numbers.[30][31][32][33][34]",
