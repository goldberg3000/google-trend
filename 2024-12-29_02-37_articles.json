                "content": "The Colorado Buffaloes football program represents the University of Colorado Boulder in college football at the NCAA Division I FBS level, and is a member of the Big 12 Conference. The team was a charter member of the Big 12 before leaving to join the Pac-12 Conference after the 2010 season. After 13 seasons in the Pac-12, the Buffaloes returned to the Big 12 in 2024. Before joining the Big 12, they were members of the Big Eight Conference. The CU football team has played at Folsom Field since 1924.[1] The Buffs all-time record is 716–520–36 (.577 winning percentage) as of the 2022 season. Colorado won the 1990 National Championship. The football program is 27th on the all-time win list and 40th in all-time winning percentage. Beginning in 1890, the Buffaloes have appeared in 29 bowl games (36th all-time), and won 27 conference championships, 5 division championships and an AP national championship in 1990. Folsom Field was built in 1924, and since then, Colorado has a 308–169–14 record at home through the 2016 season. The road game against the Nebraska Cornhuskers on November 24, 2006, was Colorado's 1,100th football game. The game on September 12, 2015, against Massachusetts was the school's 1,200th football game. Colorado won one national championship in football for 1990.[4]: 120 [5] Colorado won the national championship in 1990 under the direction of head coach Bill McCartney, who helmed the team from 1982 to 1994. While the Georgia Tech won the United Press International Coaches Poll, Colorado won the Associated Press, Football Writers Association of America and other polls. Colorado played the most difficult schedule in the country, beat more ranked teams and conference champions, and had a more talented roster.[6] Colorado capped the season with a 10–9 win over Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl, a rematch of the 1989 season Orange Bowl Game which Notre Dame won 21–6. Colorado's tie came against Tennessee, who was ranked No. 8, the first week of the season when Colorado was ranked No. 5. The second week gave the Buffs a scare, scoring with 12 seconds left in the game on a 4th and Goal attempt. The next week gave Colorado its only loss of the season, losing 23–22 to Illinois and dropping Colorado to No. 20 in the polls. Colorado then went on to beat teams ranked (at the time) No. 22 Texas, No. 12 Washington, No. 22 Oklahoma, and No. 3 Nebraska. They ended the season 7–0 in the Big Eight Conference for the second straight season. They then capped the season with a win over Notre Dame who were number 1 until a loss in their second to last game of the regular season.[7] Colorado has won 26 conference championships in over a century of college play, spanning through five conferences. † Co-champions † Co-champions The Buffaloes have played in 1,109 games during their 125 seasons, through 2014. In those seasons, 11 coaches have led Colorado to postseason bowl games: Bunny Oakes, Dallas Ward, Marcel M. Mazur, Bud Davis, Eddie Crowder, Bill Mallory, Bill McCartney, Rick Neuheisel, Gary Barnett, Dan Hawkins, Mike MacIntyre and Karl Dorrell.[8] Ten coaches have won conference championships with the Buffaloes: Fred Folsom, Myron Witham, William Saunders, Oakes, Jim Yeager, Sonny Grandelius, Mallory, McCartney and Barnett. The Buffaloes won the national championship in 1990, and have won a total of 28 conference championships. McCartney is the all-time leader in games coached with 153, total wins with 93, and conference wins with 58.[9] Folsom had the longest tenure as head coach, remaining in the position for 15 seasons. Harry Heller and Willis Keinholtz are tied for the highest overall winning percentage. Each served a single season and won eight of his nine games for a winning percentage of .889. Of coaches who served more than one season, Folsom leads with a .765 winning percentage. Davis, in terms of overall winning percentage, is the worst coach the Buffaloes have had with a .200 winning percentage. No Colorado coach has been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, although McCartney was inducted into the Orange Bowl Hall of Fame in 1996. Mike MacIntyre had brief success with the program. Hired on Dec. 10, 2012,[10] MacIntyre compiled a 30–44 record over five-plus seasons at Colorado. In 2016, MacIntyre lead Colorado to a 10–2 regular season and a trip to the Pac-12 Championship Game. It was the first winning season for Colorado since 2005, ending a 10-year streak of finishing below .500. 2016 was also the best season for the Buffaloes since 2001. As well, it marked their first time playing in a conference championship game since the 2005 Big 12 Championship Game. The team also went 8–2 in the Pac-12 after having five conference wins in the previous five seasons. Mike MacIntyre was named the Walter Camp 2016 Coach of the Year by the Walter Camp Foundation, the second Colorado football coach to earn the honor (Bill McCartney in 1989). MacIntyre was also awarded the 2016 Pac-12 Coach of the Year, American Football Coaches Association's coach of the year and comeback coach of the year awards, the Associated Press coach of the year, and the Eddie Robinson coach of the year by the Football Writers Association of America. In 2018, the Buffaloes started out the season 5–0 with wins against rivals Colorado State, Nebraska, Arizona State, and UCLA - however, MacIntyre was fired as the head coach on November 18, 2018, after a six-game losing streak.[11] Mike Sanford was named interim Head Coach after Karl Dorrell was fired during the 2022 season, Sanford was previously the Buffaloes Offensive Coordinator for the start of the 2022 campaign.[12] On December 3, Colorado announced Deion Sanders as Head Football Coach.[13] A traditional college football rivalry with the Nebraska Cornhuskers restarted in the 1980s (many historical documents show the importance of this game going back to 1898) when Bill McCartney declared the conference opponent to be their rival. His theory was since Nebraska was such a powerhouse team, if Colorado was able to beat them then they would be a good team. Colorado began to repeatedly threaten Nebraska in the late 1980s, following their win over the Huskers in 1986, and then surpassed the Huskers for the Big 8 crown in 1989. In 1990, Colorado beat Nebraska 27–12 in Lincoln for the first time since 1967, en route to their first national title. From 1996 to 2000, the series was extremely competitive, with the margin of victory by NU in those five years being only 15 points combined. The rivalry was further buoyed by the introduction of the Big 12 Conference in 1996, which moved Oklahoma and Oklahoma State to the southern division with the four new schools from Texas, formerly in the Southwest Conference. Nebraska had traditionally finished the Big 8 conference schedule with a rivalry game with Oklahoma, but the two were now in different divisions, which meant they met every other year in the regular season. Colorado replaced Oklahoma as Nebraska's final conference game of the regular season, which further intensified the rivalry. In 2001 No. 1 Nebraska came to Folsom Field undefeated and left at the short end of a nationally televised 62–36 blowout. Both teams departed the Big 12 in 2011, as NU headed east to join the Big Ten and the future of the rivalry was in doubt. On February 7, 2013, Colorado and Nebraska agreed to renew the rivalry.[14][15][16][17][18][19] Colorado traveled to Lincoln in 2018 and won 33–28 (winning against Nebraska for the first time since 2007 and the first time in Lincoln since 2004). On September 7, 2019, Colorado mounted an improbable comeback after being down 17–0 at half, to win the game in overtime, 34–31. After a 3-year break, Nebraska lost 36–14 to Colorado in Boulder in 2023, but then won against Colorado 28-10 in 2024. Nebraska leads the series 49–21–2 through the 2023 season.[20] Colorado's in-state rival is the Colorado State Rams of the Mountain West Conference, located north of Boulder in Fort Collins. The two schools are separated by 45 miles (72 km) and both consider it important and noteworthy to beat the other for bragging rights for the next year. The two football teams annually compete in the Rocky Mountain Showdown for the Centennial Cup, played in Denver, Fort Collins, and Boulder. The trophy takes its name from the state of Colorado's nickname of \"The Centennial State\". The Buffaloes lead the series 67–22–2 through the 2023 season.[21] The rivalry with Utah ran from 1903 to 1962, in which Utah and Colorado played each other nearly every year; through 1962 they had met 57 times.[22] At the time, it was the second-most played rivalry for both teams (Utah had played Utah State 62 times;[23] Colorado had played Colorado State 61 times[24]). The rivalry was dormant until 2011, when both teams joined the Pac-12, renewing the rivalry on an annual basis. The Colorado–Utah rivalry remains the fifth-most played rivalry in Utah's history, and eighth-most in Colorado's history.[25][26] Utah leads the series 34-32-3 through the 2022 season.[27] Colorado has participated in 29 bowl games, with a record of 12–17 (.414). Colorado has one inductee into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The following is a list of Consensus All-Americans from CU as listed[when?] in NCAA record books.[2] The following players have been honored by having their uniform numbers designated as retired numbers by the Buffaloes.[42][43] † = Posthumous honored In 2020, Colorado athletic director Rick George announced plans to re-issue uniform numbers 24, 67, and 11, with the support of the noted players (or their families).[42] Contemporary uniforms issued with those numbers will include a commemorative patch.[42] Nonetheless, no player has used any of those numbers since the announcement.[44][45][46][47] Uniform number 19 will remain unused for 19 years, after which it may be re-issued.[42] On November 1, 2023, Colorado's Big 12 opponents from 2024 through 2027 were revealed.[48] Home Schedule Away Schedule Announced schedules as of December 19, 2023.[49] Others beyond 2031: vs. North Texas, Sept. 4, 2032; at North Texas, Sept. 3, 2033; vs. Colorado State, Sept. 17, 2033; at Colorado State, Sept. 16, 2034; vs. Colorado State, Sept. 19, 2037; at Colorado State, Sept. 11, 2038.",

The Buffaloes are led by second-year head coach Deion Sanders. They play their home games on campus at Folsom Field in Boulder, Colorado. Following a win over Cincinnati on October 26, the Buffaloes became bowl eligible for the first time since the shortened 2020 season and for the first time in a full season since 2016.[1] Colorado was a contender to the Big 12 Championship and potentially the College Football Playoff.[2][3] However, a loss to Kansas in week 13 and Arizona State, BYU, and Iowa State winning tiebreaker games the following week eliminated the Buffaloes from contention.[4][5][6] Nevertheless, Colorado accepted an invitation to play in the Alamo Bowl against conference opponent BYU after the conclusion of the regular season.[7] Colorado cornerback and wide receiver Travis Hunter was awarded the Heisman Trophy for his performance during the season, becoming the second Buffalo to win the Heisman.[8][9] The Colorado Buffaloes spring game was held on April 27, 2024 at Folsom Field.[10] The game was televised by the Pac-12 Network.

As a child, she was enrolled in dancing classes to develop her physique, and she performed well enough to become a member of Les Grands Ballets Canadiens at 13, and was chosen as Miss Montreal at 18. As a model in the 1970s and 1980s, Haddon represented Max Factor, Revlon, Estée Lauder, and L'Oréal. She appeared on the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue in 1973 (January 29)[3] and was twice named to Harper's Bazaar's \"Ten Most Beautiful Women.\" She also appeared nude in the April 1973 issue of Playboy. Haddon worked as an actress, appearing in the Disney movie The World's Greatest Athlete (1973) with Jan-Michael Vincent. She moved to Europe, continued modeling and acting, and appeared in a number of film roles in French and English,[5] as well as occasional small parts in American movies. Her best known roles were in Madame Claude (1977), and North Dallas Forty (1979) opposite actor Nick Nolte. Haddon was originally cast for the role of Dale Arden in the 1980 film version of Flash Gordon, but producer Dino De Laurentiis replaced her with Melody Anderson just before filming commenced.[6] During Haddon's tenure as a main face for L'Oréal, sales for the Age Perfect line had increased by 50%.[7] According to The New York Times, Dayle had \"shattered age taboos\" with her multiyear contracts with L'Oréal and Estée Lauder, among other companies.[8] Clairol selected her as a spokesperson, and she later broke barriers for women over the age of 35 when she became the global face of a new anti-aging line for Estée Lauder, a first in the beauty industry. On the day that her Estée Lauder contract expired, L'Oréal signed her. She then had her own company, Dayle Haddon Concepts Inc. In early 2008 she was named a UNICEF ambassador.[9] Haddon was also the founder of a non-profit called WomenOne. The organization's motto is \"changing the world one woman at a time.\"[10] Through WomenOne, Haddon had partnered with Free The Children, an international charity, to provide scholarships for girls’ education in Kenya. Through her organization, she had raised and donated more than $150,000 for one of Free The Children's all-girls secondary schools.[11] Haddon also appeared as the face of a line of socially and environmentally responsible accessories launched by Me to We, Free The Children's partner organization.[12] She was the mother of Ryan Haddon.[13] On December 27, 2024, first responders found her unresponsive in a carriage house in Solebury Township, Pennsylvania just outside New Hope. She was declared dead at the scene, and the cause was announced as accidental carbon monoxide poisoning caused by a defective boiler. She was 76 years old.[14]",

Senior Editor Dayle Haddon, the only model to have had four major cosmetics contracts, died Friday. Haddon died and an unidentified 76-year-old individual was hospitalized due to a carbon monoxide leak in Buck’s County, Pa., according to CBS News. The home where the victims were reportedly found was said to be owned by Haddon’s former journalist daughter Ryan and Ryan’s actor husband, Marc Blucas. Officials at the Solebury, Pa., police department did not respond immediately to media requests Saturday morning about the incident. Representatives from the Bucks County coroner’s office were out on police calls and were not immediately available for comment.

She was everyone’s greatest champion. An inspiration to many.” You May Also Like A believer in beauty being how you treat people, Haddon had a longtime association with L’Oréal, including a few years of philanthropic efforts. In the past few decades she was known more as a model-turned-activist thanks to her years as a UNICEF ambassador and her education-focused nonprofit Women One. By her own account, she consulted with G7 officials about gender equality. In a 2017 interview, Haddon said her definition of beauty had evolved over the years since she began modeling in the Seventies. She said, “The way I looked was not the look at the time — very tall Nordic or Texan blonde girl. I was a very small, dark-haired Canadian with little freckles. It just wasn’t an ‘in’ look. There wasn’t a lot of diversity in looks, which there is now and is great.” Haddon added, “It took me a long time to be successful, which makes you more grateful.” “Owing everything” to fashion photographer Guy Bourdin, whom she worked with more than anyone, Haddon said, “We didn’t care about the paycheck; we only cared about creating great photos.” Sarah Moon, Helmut Newton, Cecil Beaton, Jacques Henri Lartigue and Horst were other collaborators. “For me, modeling has a lot of richness, history and depth for relating, being exposed to creativity and a complicity when people work together on something artistic and really great,” she said. Haddon proved just that earlier this month when attending the Ann Taylor store opening in New York City’s Flatiron district with her daughter. Having appeared in a campaign for the brand more than a decade ago that was shot by Annie Leibovitz, Haddon brought a still to show Ann Taylor executives and reminisced about the shoot. As one of the more seasoned models, who was among the first to get back in front of the camera years after their fame, Haddon was photographed by Leibovitz wearing a pale blue turtleneck, laughing with one hand partially covering one of her eyes. That relaxed and easygoing demeanor and minimalist style was what she presented in interviews too. A 1976 shoot with Lord Snowdon of Haddon dining alone with some high-powered European designers in their homes or wherever they preferred to be photographed was one of her favorites. She told WWD, “Some refused. Some were welcoming. Some destroyed the outfit [she was to wear] and had to stay up all night [to work as a result]. Some decided they wanted to eat caviar on the Champs Elysees.” Haddon said. “[Emanuel] Ungaro said he was too shy and would never bring anyone to his home. He wanted to go to his favorite restaurant. With [Yves] Saint Laurent, I was at his house. [Pierre] Cardin was more emphatic about what he wanted and smart about what he wanted. [Pierre] Balmain did not want to do it but he agreed as long as I did not look at him. I was not allowed to have a glass of wine or eat with him.” Having trained as a dancer, Haddon had a certain poise, with demure features and twinkling blue eyes. “A great model has to bring something of herself, but be in the style of the photographer,” said Haddon, naming Karlie Kloss, Gigi Hadid (“adorable and a look of our time”) and Christy Turlington as current favorites. Along with philanthropic ties, Kloss and Turlington understand that modeling is a business. They know, ‘How do you extend the longevity? How do you turn it into more than your five minutes of fame?’” she said. Her definition of beauty also changed. “Beauty in your 20s is a wrinkle-free beauty, with no marks, no experience. It takes time for experience and that’s a different kind of beauty. For me, a lot of beauty is wrapped up in how you treat people, how you feel about yourself and how generous you are. Generous means many things — listening, including or being kind to people. It can also be about giving, doing what you can, or making a positive difference wherever you are with whoever you meet as best you can. That’s real beauty,” Haddon said in 2017. “You can’t desperately hang onto what you looked like or what you were like in your 20s, 30s or 40s. Even though you let go of some gifts, you embrace some new gifts.” WomenOne sprang from a visit to an Angola health clinic where women had walked all night, in some cases carrying children, to get care. As a longtime UNICEF ambassador, Haddon trekked all over Africa and South America, where cholera and other diseases, hunger and poverty are destroying lives. WomenOne specialized in microdonations that some companies or NGOs might deem too small. In 2017, she was honored by the United Nations Women for Peace Association Awards. That same year Haddon took her empowerment message to Washington, D.C., with the help of Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. In honor of the “International Day of the Girl,” Haddon joined the leader, his then wife Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, Canada’s then Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland, and others who have “generous spirits, had a fierce intellect and deep passion for women’s issues” in a roundtable discussion. She also called on support from the fashion and beauty industries. Haddon told WWD before her United Nations Women for Peace award in 2017, “This is an industry that creates things for women and girls. We have to do something for their benefit not just something they buy,” adding that Apple was supporting her WomenOne initiative. Haddon shared her insights about longevity in her Simon & Schuster-published book “The Five Principles of Ageless Living: A Woman’s Guide to Lifelong Health, Beauty and Well-being.” Aside from her daughter, the names of Haddon’s survivors were not immediately known.

                "content": "Corbin Brian Burnes (born October 22, 1994) is an American professional baseball pitcher who is a free agent. He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Milwaukee Brewers and Baltimore Orioles. The Brewers selected Burnes in the fourth round of the 2016 MLB draft, and he made his MLB debut in 2018. Burnes is a four-time All-Star. He won the National League Cy Young Award in 2021, when he led the National League (NL) in earned run average. He led the NL in strikeouts in 2022. Burnes attended Centennial High School in Bakersfield, California. In 2013, his senior year, he had a 9–4 win–loss record with a 2.23 earned run average (ERA) in 22 appearances.[1] After high school, he enrolled and played college baseball at Saint Mary's College of California.[2][3] In 2015, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Orleans Firebirds of the Cape Cod Baseball League.[4] In 2016, his junior year, he posted a 9–2 record with a 2.48 ERA in 16 starts. After the season, he was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in the fourth round of the 2016 Major League Baseball draft.[5] Burnes made his professional debut with the Arizona League Brewers and was later promoted to the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers.[6] In 35+2⁄3 innings pitched between Arizona and Wisconsin, Burnes posted a 3–0 record with a 2.02 ERA. He started the 2017 season with the Carolina Mudcats and was later promoted to the Biloxi Shuckers after recording a 1.05 ERA after ten starts.[7][8] Burnes finished 2017 with a combined 8–3 record and 1.67 ERA between both teams.[9] The Brewers named him their minor league pitcher of the year after the season.[10] MLB.com ranked Burnes as Milwaukee's second-best prospect going into the 2018 season.[11] He began the season with the Colorado Springs Sky Sox.[12] The Brewers promoted Burnes to the majors for the first time on July 8, 2018.[13] He made his major league debut on July 10, pitching two scoreless innings, striking out one, and recording his first major league save.[14] In the 2018 NLDS against the Colorado Rockies, he pitched four scoreless innings in relief across two appearances, earning the win in the clinching 6–0 Game 3 victory. In the 2018 NLCS, Burnes got the last six outs of their game six win against the Dodgers.[citation needed] To start 2019, Burnes began the year in the starting rotation. However, he struggled in that role, allowing 11 home runs across his first 3 starts. It was announced he would move back to the bullpen. He continued to struggle in the bullpen, compiling a 9.00 ERA through 26 appearances. He was placed on the injured list on July 15 with shoulder discomfort. He finished the season with a 1–5 record and an 8.82 ERA in 49 innings. In the shortened 2020 season, Burnes pitched to a 4–1 record and recorded an ERA of 2.11 while striking out 88 batters in 59+2⁄3 innings. He finished 6th in the NL Cy Young voting.[15] Burnes struck out 40 batters without issuing a walk in his first four starts of 2021, an unprecedented four game stretch for an MLB starting pitcher.[16] On May 13, Burnes set the MLB record for the most strikeouts to begin a season before issuing a walk, with 58, surpassing the previous record of 51, held by Kenley Jansen.[17] Burnes was named to the 2021 MLB All-Star Game.[18] On August 12, Burnes tied an MLB record after striking out 10 consecutive batters in a game against the Chicago Cubs.[19] On September 11, Burnes pitched the first eight innings of a combined no-hitter with Josh Hader against the Cleveland Indians, in which he struck out 14 batters. He held a perfect game until a seventh-inning walk to Myles Straw.[20] Burnes finished the 2021 season with an 11–5 record and led the major leagues in ERA (2.43), strikeouts per nine innings (12.6), home runs per nine innings (0.4), and strikeout-to-walk ratio (6.88).[21] He won the National League Cy Young Award, becoming the third Brewers pitcher to win the award.[22] He was also named to the first 2021 All-MLB Team as a starting pitcher.[23] Burnes was selected as the starter for Game 1 of the 2021 NLDS against the Atlanta Braves. Burnes pitched six shutout innings, striking out six. He was not credited with the win, however, as he battled in a tight pitchers' duel with Atlanta's Charlie Morton. Milwaukee won the game, 2–1.[citation needed] On March 22, 2022, Burnes signed a $6.5 million contract with the Brewers, avoiding salary arbitration.[24] The Brewers named Burnes their Opening Day starting pitcher.[25] He was named to the 2022 MLB All-Star Game.[26] In 2022, Burnes was 12–8 with a 2.94 ERA in 202 innings, and struck out a league-high 243 batters.[27] On defense, he had a .961 fielding percentage.[27] He was a finalist for the NL Gold Glove Award at pitcher, but it was won for the third straight season by Max Fried.[28] Burnes went to salary arbitration with the Brewers, with the arbiter choosing the $10.01 million salary requested by the Brewers, rather than the $10.75 million requested by Burnes. He said that the process \"definitely hurt\" his relationship with the franchise.[29] Burnes started for the Brewers on Opening Day.[30] In 32 starts for Milwaukee, he posted a 10–8 record and 3.39 ERA with 200 strikeouts, and was named an All–Star for the third straight season.[31] On February 1, 2024, the Brewers traded Burnes to the Baltimore Orioles in exchange for DL Hall, Joey Ortiz, and a compensatory draft pick.[32] He made 32 appearances - all starts - for the Orioles in 2024, pitching to a 2.92 ERA and a 15-9 record with 181 strikeouts across 194.1 innings pitched.[33] Burnes also made his fourth consecutive All-Star team.[34] After the 2024 season, Burnes became a free agent.[35] The Orioles extended the qualifying offer of $21.05 million for the 2025 season to Burnes, but he declined.[36] Burnes is a power pitcher who has thrown six different pitches: a four-seam fastball between 94–97 miles per hour (151–156 km/h), a sinker between 95–97 miles per hour (153–156 km/h), a changeup between 88–91 miles per hour (142–146 km/h), a slider between 86–89 miles per hour (138–143 km/h), a curveball between 80–83 miles per hour (129–134 km/h), and a cut fastball between 93–96 miles per hour (150–154 km/h). He virtually abandoned his four-seamer after 2020 after finding far more success exclusively using his cutter.[37] During spring training of 2024, Burnes broke out a second curveball, which he throws about 5 miles per hour (8.0 km/h) faster than his first, in strikeout situations.[38] Burnes is the son of Rick and Kandi Burnes.[39] Burnes and his wife Brooke married in 2020.[40][41] They have three children.[42][43]",

                "title": "Losing Corbin Burnes continues Orioles' underwhelming offseason, but there's still time to salvage it - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Objectively, the Baltimore Orioles are one of the best teams in baseball. They won 101 games in 2023 and 91 games in 2024, and their 192 combined wins from 2023-24 are third most in baseball behind the Dodgers (198) and Braves (193). FanGraphs projections peg the O's as a top five team in baseball, essentially on par with Steve Cohen's big-spending Mets. So why then do they feel so underwhelming? Early Saturday morning, the Orioles lost ace Corbin Burnes to free agency. To the Diamondbacks, specifically. Arizona gave Burnes a six-year, $210 million contract with an opt out after Year 2. The O's were said to have interest in retaining Burnes, who threw 194 1/3 innings with a 2.92 ERA and finished fifth in the Cy Young voting in his lone season in Baltimore, but obviously it did not happen. With Burnes now a D-back, Baltimore's rotation depth chart currently looks like this: Again, underwhelming. I would even take it a step further and say you have to do better than that if your goal is winning the World Series. GM Mike Elias needs to do better by building a rotation capable of supporting a lineup loaded with young talent. New owner David Rubenstein needs to do better investing in his team. Baltimore's estimated 2025 payroll ranks 18th in baseball. Why so low? Earlier this month, Pitcher List's Ben Palmer reported Rubenstein gave Elias to green light to spend, but Elias doesn't want to. My read on that is the GM is falling on the sword for an owner who doesn't really want to spend. The alternative is Rubenstein is feckless, and unwilling to take charge of the team he owns. The owner wants to spend but the big bad GM won't let him 😕. To be fair to the Orioles, they did not make the Burnes trade until Feb. 1 last offseason, so there is plenty of time between now and spring training to do something that really moves the needle. This is a very passive approach to team building, though. The O's went through the ugly rebuild and came out the other side with a boatload of young position players but are timid on the pitching market. I get it: pitchers break, and modern pitch design and analytics allow teams to find quality arms almost anywhere. On waivers, in minor league free agency, in the late rounds of the draft, etc. Why sink $210 million dollars into Burnes' age 30-35 seasons and assume all that risk when you can dig up a Suárez or trade for a lower-salaried Eflin and coach them up? The reason is good players win games and championships, not good value. Also, there is a social contract here. Fans stick with the team through the rebuild because the promise is the team will try its hardest to win a championship down the road. Are Elias, Rubenstein, and O's going all-out to win a title? They aren't with an 18th-ranked payroll and that rotation. The Orioles have been one of the best teams in baseball the last two years and I expect them to again be one of the best teams in baseball next year. But as good as they could be? No, probably not, barring a surprise rotation addition. I mean, forget Burnes. Why weren't the O's in on Juan Soto? He fits their contention window perfectly, yet there wasn't a shred of interest, reportedly. At some point, the Orioles need to put their foot on the gas. The AL is the leanest it's been in a long time -- Burnes is merely the latest high-end player to leave the AL for the NL -- and that should be an invitation to go for it, not hold back and bank on things going your way. The O's are very good, but an underwhelming winter to date leaves them not as good as they could be. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "title": "Corbin Burnes to sign with Diamondbacks: Ace agrees to six-year, $210 million deal with Arizona, per report - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Arizona Diamondbacks have landed the best starting pitcher on the free-agent market. The D-backs and righty Corbin Burnes have agreed to a six-year contract worth $210 million, reports the New York Post. According to Heyman, Burnes' contract with Arizona includes an opt-out after the 2026 season. Burnes, 30, joined the Baltimore Orioles in a three-player trade with the Milwaukee Brewers last offseason. He had a terrific season with the O's, throwing 194 ⅓ innings with a 2.92 ERA and 181 strikeouts. That earned him a fifth-place finish in the AL Cy Young voting. Burnes allowed one run in eight innings in his only start this postseason. Our R.J. Anderson ranked Burnes the second-best free agent available this offseason, behind only Juan Soto. Here's his write-up: At first blush, Burnes is clearly this free-agent class' best and most reliable starting pitcher. He's earned four consecutive trips to the All-Star Game; he's among the league leaders in innings pitched since the pandemic; and he's proved that his game works both inside the American League and outside of Milwaukee, as if there was any doubt. Yet if you look closely enough at his profile, you'll notice some hints of potential decline. For starters, Burnes' strikeout rate deteriorated for a fourth year in a row, dipping beneath a batter per inning for the first time in his career. His trademark cutter, the primary pitch in his bag, returned its worst results (highest average and lowest whiff rate) until some late-season tinkering helped get it back on course. His in-zone contact rate, meanwhile, put him in the same neighborhood occupied by Kyle Gibson, Chris Flexen, and Carson Fulmer, among others. Mind you, none of the above prevented Burnes from notching another high-quality season. His command remains superb, enabling him to control quality of contact the way few others can. Burnes himself has explained away his strikeout rate by saying he was prioritizing early outs. Maybe so, but we suspect teams will think a little longer and a little harder than they expected to before handing him a long-term deal. As noted, Burnes has seen his strikeout rate gradually slip since becoming a full-time member of the rotation in 2021. He struck out 35.6% of the batters he faced in 2021, a top-of-the-line number for a starter. That dipped to 30.5% in 2022, 25.5% in 2023, and an almost perfectly league average 23.1% in 2024. Burnes remains excellent, but that is a noticeable decline. Burnes won the NL Cy Young Award as a member of the Brewers in 2021, and he's now finished in the top 10 of the Cy Young balloting for five straight years. Burnes enters the 2025 season with a career ERA+ of 129 and a career WAR of 17.1 across parts of seven major-league seasons. With Arizona, Burnes joins a potentially strong rotation that also includes Zac Gallen, Eduardo Rodriguez, Merrill Kelly and Brandon Pfaadt. The Diamondbacks, who won the National League pennant in 2023, are coming off a 2024 season in which they went 89-73 and just missed securing a wild-card spot in the postseason. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

                "content": "More on the Meaning of Patriot The word patriot signifies a person who loves their country and is ready to boldly support and defend it. That meaning has endured since the word's arrival in English in the 16th century, but it has not marched through the years unchallenged. Ultimately derived from Greek patrios, meaning \"of one’s father,\" patriot entered English via French patriote—meaning \"fellow countryman\" or \"compatriot\"—during a time of political unrest in western Europe that was characterized by infighting among fellow countrymen—especially among those of the Protestant and Catholic faiths. For much of the 17th century, words like good were attached to patriot to distinguish patriots who shared both a love of country and a common allegiance from those having opposing beliefs and loyalties: to be deemed a \"good patriot\" was to be a lover of country who agreed on political and/or religious matters with whoever was doing the deeming. The Catholiques were knowne good Patriots under our former Kings. — Henry Hammond, A view of some exceptions which have been made by a Romanist to the Lord Viscount Falkland's discourse…, 1646 Patriot was used to mean \"good patriot\" without modification more frequently by the end of the 17th century, but it tended to apply to a supporter of the ruling monarchy. A Patriot, both the King and Country serves; Prerogative, and Privilege preserves. — John Dryden, Fables, Ancient and Modern, 1700 Another effect of the tumultuous times was the development of a derogatory use of patriot to refer to hypocritical patriots: people who claimed devotion to one's country and government but whose actions or beliefs belied such devotion. This ultimately led to the discrediting of the loyalty and steadfastness associated with the word patriot. The years leading up to the American Revolutionary War further propagated the notion of patriot as a name for a seditious rebel against the monarchy. American writers of the 18th century, however, heartily embraced the word to define the colonists who took action against British control. As tensions continued to escalate, a new meaning of patriot came to the forefront, referring to a person who advocates or promotes the independence of their land or people from the country of which they are a colony. Benjamin Franklin provides an early record of this use. It should be no Wonder … if among so many Thousand true Patriots as New England contains there should be found even Twelve Judases. — Benjamin Franklin, letter, 7 July 1773 In the end, the patriots won the war and, centuries after America’s Declaration of Independence, patriot has held its place of honor in the English language as the meritorious name for the brave men and women of the armed forces who defend the rights and freedoms of their country. Stripped of all past disparagement, the word has returned to its original meaning: \"one who loves his or her country.\" Today, active fighting or resistance is not a requirement to being a patriot: a person only needs a strong sense of love for one’s country.

                "content": "The Nebraska Cornhuskers football team competes as part of the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision, representing the University of Nebraska–Lincoln in the Big Ten Conference. Nebraska has played its home games at Memorial Stadium since 1923 and sold out every game at the venue since 1962.[5] Nebraska is among the most storied programs in college football history and has the eighth-most all-time victories among FBS teams.[6] NU has won forty-six conference championships and five national championships (1970, 1971, 1994, 1995, and 1997), along with seven other national titles the school does not claim. Its 1971 and 1995 title-winning teams are considered among the best ever.[7][8] Nebraska's three Heisman Trophy winners – Johnny Rodgers, Mike Rozier, and Eric Crouch – join twenty-four other Cornhuskers in the College Football Hall of Fame.[9] The program's first extended period of success came just after the turn of the twentieth century. Between 1900 and 1916, Nebraska had five undefeated seasons and completed a stretch of thirty-four games without a loss, still a program record.[10] Despite a span of twenty-one conference championships in thirty-four seasons, the Cornhuskers did not experience major national success until Bob Devaney was hired in 1962. Devaney won two national championships and eight conference titles in eleven seasons as head coach, but perhaps his most lasting achievement was the hiring of Tom Osborne as offensive coordinator in 1969.[11] Osborne was named Devaney's successor in 1973 and over the next twenty-five years established himself as one of the best coaches in college football history with his trademark I-formation offense and revolutionary strength, conditioning, and nutrition programs.[12][13][14] Following Osborne's retirement in 1997, Nebraska cycled through five head coaches before hiring Matt Rhule in 2022.[15] Nebraska has had thirty-one head coaches in the program's history, with five others coaching at least one game on a non-permanent basis. The program has been coached by Matt Rhule since 2023. Seven past Nebraska head coaches have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame: Edward N. Robinson, Fielding H. Yost, Dana X. Bible, Biff Jones, Bob Devaney, Tom Osborne, and Frank Solich. Osborne is the program's all-time leader in most major categories; his 0.836 career winning percentage is fifth-highest in major college football history.[17] Thirteen Nebraska coaches have won a conference championship at the school, and Devaney and Osborne combined to win five national titles. Nebraska has won five consensus national championships.[18] The first of these came in 1970 under the leadership of head coach Bob Devaney and featured a unique quarterback rotation between Van Brownson and Jerry Tagge.[19] Nebraska entered the 1971 Orange Bowl ranked third nationally, but losses by No. 1 Texas and No. 2 Ohio State – along with a late game-winning touchdown rush by Tagge – gave NU its first consensus title. The Cornhuskers repeated as national champion the following season with Tagge as the full-time starter, a team that is often considered one of the best in college football history.[20] Nebraska was challenged just once all season, a 35–31 victory over No. 2 Oklahoma in Norman that was billed the \"Game of the Century.\"[20] Wins over Colorado and Alabama (the latter in the 1972 Orange Bowl) made NU the only national champion to defeat the teams that finished No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4 in the final AP poll.[20] Tom Osborne replaced Devaney in 1973, and despite several near-misses, did not win his first national title until over two decades into his tenure.[a] Nebraska's 1994 title-winning season, nearly derailed when star quarterback Tommie Frazier was sidelined with blood clots in September, was capped by a 24–17 victory over Miami in the Orange Bowl.[21] With Frazier at full strength the following season, NU repeated as national champion; its 62–24 Fiesta Bowl victory over Florida was the largest margin of victory in a national title game until 2023. The team is often considered among the best in college football history.[22][23] Osborne's final title came in 1997, two years later. The most significant moment of the season was a game-tying touchdown against Missouri that became known as the \"Flea Kicker.\"[24] Top-ranked Nebraska won the game in overtime, but was jumped in both major polls by Michigan. Postseason wins over Texas A&M and Tennessee vaulted NU back ahead of the Wolverines in the Coaches Poll, though not the AP Poll, sharing the national championship. Unclaimed national championships Nebraska has been awarded seven other national championships from NCAA-designated major selectors the school does not claim.[18] Nebraska has won forty-six conference championships. The earliest of these came in the short-lived Western Interstate University Football Association, one of college football's first conferences, which NU participated in for six seasons with Iowa, Kansas, and Missouri.[25] The conference dissolved in 1897 and NU spent the next decade as an independent until the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association – which became the Big Eight – was founded in 1907. Nebraska dominated the MVIAA in its early years, winning nine championships in twelve years before leaving the conference in 1919 to again play as an independent. NU rejoined in 1921 and won the conference twelve times before 1940. Following Biff Jones's departure to become the athletic director at Army in 1941, NU went twenty-two seasons without a conference championship. Devaney was hired in 1962 and quickly turned NU into a powerhouse, winning eight conference titles and two national titles during his eleven years as head coach. Osborne succeeded him in 1973 and won thirteen conference championships; the late-season meeting between Nebraska and Oklahoma often became a de-facto Big Eight championship game, as the two schools combined to win at least a share of the conference title thirty-three times during Devaney and Osborne's combined thirty-six-year tenure.[7] Osborne's final conference championship was a victory in the 1997 Big 12 Championship Game in the second year of its existence. Nebraska won the Big 12 again two years later, its most recent conference championship. Nebraska won ten division championships. Nine of these were in the Big 12's North Division, which NU played in until its departure for the Big Ten in 2011. Nebraska won one division title across thirteen seasons in the Big Ten's Leaders Division and West Division; the conference disbanded its divisions prior to the 2024 season.[27] † Co-champion Nebraska has played in fifty-three bowl games, including a then-record thirty-five straight from 1969 to 2003, with a record of 26–27.[28] Nebraska declined an invitation to play in the second-ever Rose Bowl Game following the 1915 season and did not make its bowl debut until 1941. Twenty-one years later, Bob Devaney's first season ended with the first bowl victory in program history, a 36–34 victory over Miami (FL) in the 1962 Gotham Bowl.[28] During Devaney's tenure, Nebraska began a stretch of thirty-five consecutive seasons with a bowl appearance, a streak that ended in 2004. The program regularly featured in the Orange Bowl due to the Big Eight's bowl affiliations, playing in the game seventeen times between 1954 and 1997, first against SEC opposition and later against the ACC.[28] Memorial Stadium, known as The Sea of Red, has been home of the Cornhuskers since 1923 and is the location of an ongoing NCAA-record 403-game sellout streak. The sellout streak dates back to 1962, Bob Devaney's first season at Nebraska.[29][30] The stadium becomes the \"third-largest city in Nebraska\" on game days, as its capacity exceeds that of every Nebraska town except for Omaha and Lincoln.[31] The stadium has undergone a series of expansion since 1923, bringing the official capacity to 85,458.[1] The largest crowd in Memorial Stadium history occurred on September 20, 2014, a Nebraska win over Miami with an announced attendance of 91,585.[2] Three statues sit outside of the stadium. The oldest, unveiled in 1997, depicts six Nebraska defenders tackling a ball carrier.[32] Creator Fred Hoppe said, \"the monument displays the sense of pride that Nebraskans have for their football team.\" In 2006, Hoppe created a statue of Tom Osborne with his arm around quarterback Brook Berringer, which is located outside the Osborne Athletic Complex.[33] On August 30, 2013, a bronze statue of Bob Devaney was unveiled at the main entrance of the newly remodeled east stadium. Sculptor Joe Putjenter also created the Tunnel Walk gates inside the stadium.[34] Before the construction of Memorial Stadium, Nebraska played its home games at Antelope Park and Nebraska Field. Gameday traditions Since 1993, Nebraska's home games have opened with the \"Tunnel Walk\" as the team takes the field before kickoff, typically to the Alan Parsons Project instrumental \"Sirius.\" The team first emerged from the southwest corner of the field and later, upon the completion of the Osborne Athletic Complex in 2006, from the northwest corner. When NU's home locker room was moved to the Osborne Legacy Complex in 2023, the team's entrance was moved to the northeast corner of the stadium. The Tunnel Walk is preceded by a \"Husker Power\" chant – half the stadium chants \"Husker\" in unison and the other half responds with \"Power.\"[35] Fans have released red helium balloons when Nebraska scores its first points at home games since the 1930s.[36] Global helium shortages and environmental concerns in recent years have threatened the tradition, which was paused in 2012 and 2022.[37][38] Walk-on program NU accepted its first walk-ons in the early 1960s and Tom Osborne began an official program in 1973 when the NCAA reduced the number of scholarships schools could offer.[39] Nebraska stocked its program with walk-ons from across the region throughout Osborne's and Frank Solich's tenures, and as a result the school's rosters were often unusually large – NU had 202 players on its 2002 Rose Bowl team, while opponent Miami had 107.[40] Osborne credited his walk-ons with providing flexibility to better scout future opponents and provided them the same access to training facilities and academic counseling as those with scholarships.[41] Though NU's expansive walk-on program is most frequently associated with Osborne, the school has typically maintained a larger-than-usual roster since his retirement as well.[40][42] Six former Nebraska walk-ons have become All-Americans and twenty-nine have played in the National Football League.[43] Helmets Nebraska's first helmet was red with a single white stripe, later changed to plain white with a black number on the side. From 1967 to 1969, the helmet featured a red, offset \"NU\" on each side. In 1970, this was changed to the now-familiar single \"N,\" although a few \"NU\" helmets remained as late as 1971. The change was necessitated due to a shortage of \"U\" stickers, and when the program claimed its first national championship, the single N remained.[44] Aside from a facemask swap from gray to red, the helmet design is unchanged since. Jerseys The Cornhuskers wore full shoulder stripes in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which were phased out as mesh and tearaway jerseys became popular. From 1980 to 1983, Nebraska's jerseys featured only a block \"N\" on the sleeves. Stripes and TV numbers were permanently re-added in 1984, although both have decreased in size as jersey sleeves have shortened.[45] A patch was added to the left shoulder to commemorate the hundredth season of Nebraska football in 1989; it remained for future seasons and was altered to read \"Nebraska Football: A Winning Tradition.\"[46] Player last names first appeared on jerseys for road games and bowl games in the late 1970s, but home jerseys remained nameless except for seniors playing their final home game. Last names were permanently affixed to all jerseys in 1988.[45] Nebraska's defense is often referred to as the \"Blackshirts,\" a reference to the black jerseys worn by starting defensive players during practice. The tradition originated in 1964 when Bob Devaney wanted a way to more quickly distinguish between his various units.[47] Depictions of the Blackshirts often include a skull and crossbones. Pants Nebraska traditionally wears white pants at home and red on the road, with rare exceptions. The team first donned red pants with red jerseys for its 1986 contest with Oklahoma; the combination was unofficially retired after a Nebraska loss.[48] Nebraska first wore all-white uniforms in the 1991 Florida Citrus Bowl and again for its first three road games in 1992; NU lost three of these games and \"surrender suits,\" as they became known, were not used again for a decade.[49] Nebraska wore white-on-white in Bill Callahan's final game as head coach, a 65–51 loss to Colorado in 2007, and again on four occasions in 2014.[50] From 1968 through 1994, Nebraska's pants had two stripes down each side. These were removed prior to the 1995 season and the pants remained stripe-less until 2001. In 2002, Nebraska featured large side panels on its jersey and pants, and wore all-white in every road game – the changes were unpopular among fans and most were reverted, which included the return of pant stripes.[45] Pant stripes were again removed during Scott Frost's tenure as head coach as a tribute to the style from his playing career, and returned following his departure.[51] Alternate uniforms The first documented instance of Nebraska wearing alternate uniforms came against South Dakota in 1920 – the Cornhuskers were forced into blue jerseys when the visiting Coyotes mistakenly brought their home reds to Lincoln.[52] The same situation arose three years later against Oklahoma in the first-ever game at Memorial Stadium.[52] Nebraska celebrated the stadium's hundredth anniversary in 2023, wearing blue-trimmed jerseys to commemorate the occasion.[53] Nebraska did not use a pre-planned alternate design until 2009, and has used one each season since 2012. Many of these were throwback or \"fauxback\" uniforms, worn to commemorate past events or championships: 2009 (the 300th consecutive sellout at Memorial Stadium),[54] 2017 (the twentieth anniversary of Nebraska's 1997 national championship),[55] 2018 (the hundredth anniversary of the end of World War I),[56] 2021 (the twentieth anniversary of the September 11 attacks),[57] 2022 (to honor Nebraska's 1983 team),[58] and 2023 (the hundredth anniversary of Memorial Stadium).[53] Nebraska and Wisconsin played the first \"Adidas Unrivaled\" game in 2012; both schools wore uniforms featuring block letters instead of front numbers.[59] NU wore black jerseys with white stencil font numbers against UCLA the following year.[60] Nebraska wore an all-red uniform featuring black metallic stripes on the jersey and pants in 2014, and used similar all-black and all-white designs the next two seasons.[61] Nebraska wore Blackshirt-themed alternate uniforms in 2019, featuring a black jersey with a Blackshirts logo on both sleeves.[62] Scott Frost suggested this iteration may become a permanent alternate design to be worn after Nebraska's defense plays particularly well.[63] Nebraska used the uniforms again in 2020, and unveiled a white version to be worn away from home, but has not used either since.[64] Adidas has been Nebraska's official shoe and uniform sponsor since 1996. In 2017, the school and sponsor signed an eleven-year, $128 million apparel deal.[65] The \"rivalry\" between Nebraska and Colorado, one-sided for much of its history, gained traction with Colorado's resurgence in the 1990s. The teams have met 71 times, with the series dating back to 1898, a 23–10 Nebraska win. The Cornhuskers lead the series 50–21–2. The \"rivalry\" began when Bill McCartney dictated that Nebraska would become Colorado's rival by writing their name in red on the schedule when he arrived in 1982.[66] A bison head named Mr. Chip was presented to the winning team throughout the 1950s, but this exchange ended when Colorado misplaced the trophy in 1961.[67] The teams have not played annually since both programs exited the Big 12 in 2011.[citation needed] The Iowa–Nebraska rivalry debuted in 1891, a 22–0 Iowa win. Since 2011, the game is held annually the Friday after Thanksgiving. Also, the game was named the Heroes Game, and the winner keeps the Heroes Trophy. The teams have met 54 times, with the Cornhuskers leading the series 30–22–3.[citation needed] Nebraska and Kansas share a natural border rivalry and maintained the longest non-interrupted rivalry in college football history at 105 years. The teams have met 117 times, with the series dating back to 1892, a 12–0 Kansas win. The Cornhuskers lead the series 91–23–3, which includes 36 consecutive victories from 1969 to 2004. Since Nebraska's move to the Big Ten in 2011, the series has been dormant. No future games are scheduled.[citation needed] Nebraska and Kansas State were conference rivals from 1913 to 2010. With only 135 miles separating the schools, they were the nearest cross-border rivals in the Big Eight and Big 12 conferences. The teams have met 95 times, with the series dating back to 1911, a 59–0 Nebraska win. Nebraska leads the series 78–15–2, which includes 29 consecutive victories from 1969 to 1997. Since Nebraska's move to the Big Ten in 2011, the series has been dormant. No future games are scheduled.[citation needed] The 1939 game was televised in Manhattan, Kansas, making it the second televised college football game. The 1992 contest was held in Tokyo as the Coca-Cola Classic. Nebraska's series with Miami is among the most significant \"bowl rivalries\" in college football. The teams have met twelve times, with the series dating back to 1951, a 19–7 Miami win. The series is tied, 6–6. No future game is yet scheduled.[citation needed] The rivalry's most notable game is the 1984 Orange Bowl. Top-ranked Nebraska scored with seconds remaining to make the game 31–30, but NU head coach Tom Osborne opted to try for a two-point conversion instead of an extra point, even though a tie would have given Nebraska the national championship. Miami won the game and its first national title.[68] The $5 Bits of Broken Chair Trophy has been awarded to the winner of the Minnesota–Nebraska game since 2014. The teams have met 61 times, dating back to 1900, a 20–12 Minnesota win. The Golden Gophers lead the series 35–25–2. Minnesota holds the trophy after defeating the Cornhuskers in 2023. The teams will meet next in 2025.[citation needed] The Victory Bell (also known as the Missouri–Nebraska Bell) has been awarded to the winner of the Missouri–Nebraska game since 1927. The teams have met 104 times, with the series dating back to 1892, a 1–0 NU win when Missouri forfeited to protest the presence of African-American George Flippin on Nebraska's roster.[69] The Cornhuskers lead the series 65–36–3. Nebraska holds the Victory Bell after defeating the Tigers in 2010. Since Nebraska's move to the Big Ten in 2011, the series has been dormant. No future games are scheduled.[citation needed] Nebraska and Oklahoma has long been considered one of the great college football rivalries. The teams have met 87 times dating back to 1912, a 13–9 Nebraska win. The Sooners lead the series 46–38–3. Since Nebraska's move to the Big Ten in 2011, the series was dormant until 2021 when Oklahoma beat Nebraska 23–16 in Norman. Future non-conference games are scheduled for 2029 and 2030. Notably, the 2021 game in Norman marked the 50th anniversary of Nebraska's 35–31 victory over Oklahoma in the \"Game of the Century\".[citation needed] Nebraska dominated the series until 1942, going 16–3–3 in the first twenty-two meetings. The Sooners then won sixteen consecutive games, the longest streak in the series. Nebraska's 1959 win both ended the Cornhuskers' drought against the Sooners and snapped Oklahoma's 74-game conference win streak. Nebraska won the \"Game of the Century\" in 1971, of which Dave Kindred of The Courier-Journal wrote, \"They can quit playing now, they have played the perfect game.\" Oklahoma won every matchup from 1972 to 1977, a streak that ended in 1978, when Nebraska upset No. 1 Oklahoma; less than two months later, OU won a rematch in the Orange Bowl. Nebraska controlled the 1990s, including a 69–7 win in 1997, the largest margin of victory in series history. When the Big 12 was formed in 1996, the schools no longer played annually, ending a stretch of 68 consecutive years they had met. The teams met for the last time as conference opponents in the 2010 Big 12 Championship Game, when Oklahoma defeated Nebraska 23–20. The two programs combined to win 74 of 89 Big Eight championships, 41 by Nebraska and 33 by Oklahoma. The teams played eighteen times when both were ranked in the AP Poll top ten, and nine times when both were in the top five. The Freedom Trophy has been awarded to the winner of the Nebraska–Wisconsin game since 2014. The teams have met eighteen times, with the series dating back to 1901, an 18–0 Wisconsin win. The Badgers lead the series 13–5. Nebraska holds the Freedom Trophy after defeating the Badgers in 2024. The teams play annually. Winners in bold.

Campbell Trophy AP Player of the Year Twenty-seven former Nebraska coaches and players have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.[70] Nebraska has retired the number of three players and the jersey of twenty-two others.[71] The first of these was Tom Novak, the only four-time first-team all-conference selection in NU history, whose No. 60 was permanently retired shortly after the end of his playing career in 1949.[e][72] Johnny Rodgers became the second player to have his number retired after winning the 1972 Heisman Trophy – though Rodgers allowed his No. 20 to be worn by his son Terry (and several others, most recently in 2008), the university considers it \"permanently retired.\"[73] Rich Glover's jersey was retired at the same time as Rodgers's, but his No. 79 remained in circulation. Over the next several decades Nebraska retired the jersey of each of its major award winners, typically during the offseason following the end of their collegiate career.[73] Bob Brown, the first All-American coached by Bob Devaney at NU, had his No. 64 permanently retired in 2004.[f][73] In 2017, the school recognized eight of its early College Football Hall of Fame inductees – including Guy Chamberlin, whose career predated the use of numbers on jerseys – by retiring their jerseys in a ceremony celebrating the 125th anniversary of the N Club, an organization of past letterwinners.[72] The name and number of each honoree is displayed at Memorial Stadium, directly below the North Stadium press box. Nebraska leads the nation in Academic All-America selections, both in football and across all sports. Nebraska boasts seventy CoSIDA First-Team and 108 overall Academic All-America selections, both tops in the nation. The list includes fifteen Huskers that have been named first team Academic All-Americans twice in their careers. The Huskers also lead the nation with a total of 330 Academic All-Americans across all sports.[74] Nebraska has four players that have been selected as a First Team Academic All-American by entities other than CoSIDA: Don Fricke (1960), Pat Clare (1960), Jim Osberg (1965), and Tony Jeter (1965). Nebraska has had 368 former players drafted into the National Football League, including thirty-four first-round picks, two players selected first overall (Sam Francis in 1937 and Irving Fryar in 1984), and one player selected with the last pick of the draft (Stan Hegener in 1971). Guy Chamberlin, Nebraska's first consensus All-American, signed with the Decautur Staleys (now the Chicago Bears) in 1920 and a year later, scored the game-winning touchdown in the controversial \"Staley Swindle\" game.[75] Chamberlin went on to win four more APFA/NFL championships as a player and coach and still has the highest winning percentage of any coach in NFL history (0.784, among coaches with at least fifty wins).[76] Former Nebraska I-back Roger Craig became the first player in NFL history to score three touchdowns in a Super Bowl in 1985. The following season, he became the first player with 1,000 rushing yards and 1,000 receiving yards in a single NFL season, and in 1988 he was named Offensive Player of the Year.[77] Craig and fullback Tom Rathman, another former Cornhusker, played five seasons together on a high-powered San Francisco 49ers offense, winning two more Super Bowls. Vince Ferragamo, Nebraska's quarterback in 1975 and 1976, started Super Bowl XIV for the Los Angeles Rams, the only former Cornhusker to start at quarterback in a Super Bowl.[78] Zac Taylor, another former Nebraska quarterback, was the head coach of the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl LVI.[78] NU was represented by at least one player in each Super Bowl from 1993 until 2019, the longest active streak of any school at the time it was snapped.[g][79] Five former Nebraska players have been enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[80] There are nineteen Huskers on NFL rosters, along with three coaches.[81] Players Coaches The Big Ten Conference added four new member schools prior to the 2024 season and disbanded the division system it had used in some form since 2011.[82] Nebraska annually faces one protected rivalry in this scheduling format, Iowa. The remaining eight conference games rotate amongst the remaining sixteen teams.[83]",

                "content": "Scott Alexander Scheffler (born June 21, 1996)[1] is an American professional golfer who plays on the PGA Tour. He is currently ranked world number one in the Official World Golf Ranking, and has held that position for over 100 weeks.[3] He has won two major championships, both the 2022 and 2024 Masters Tournament. Scheffler had a successful amateur career, including victory at the U.S. Junior Amateur in 2013 and low-amateur honors at the 2017 U.S. Open. Having turned professional in 2018, he was named Korn Ferry Tour Player of the Year in 2019 and PGA Tour Rookie of the Year in 2020. He had a breakout season in 2022; in the span of three months, he recorded his first victory on the PGA Tour, rose to world number one, and won his first major championship at the 2022 Masters Tournament. Scheffler won The Players Championship in 2023 and 2024, becoming the first to win the title in back-to-back years.[4] He claimed his second major championship at the 2024 Masters Tournament, and won the gold medal in the men's individual tournament at the 2024 Summer Olympics. Scheffler was born in Ridgewood, New Jersey on June 21, 1996. His father, Scott, grew up in Englewood Cliffs, and attended St. Cecilia High School in Englewood. His mother, Diane (née DeLorenzo), grew up in Park Ridge.[5][6] She attended Park Ridge High School, where she was a friend and classmate of James Gandolfini, later known for his lead role in The Sopranos.[7] Scheffler is of Italian descent on his mother's side and German descent on his father's side.[8] His grandfather was a veteran of the U.S. military who served in the Korean War.[9] Scheffler was the only boy among four children. His sisters are named Callie, Molly and Sara.[10] The family lived in Montvale, New Jersey, until Scheffler was aged six, when they moved to Dallas, Texas, in the wake of the September 11 attacks.[11] Scott was a stay-at-home dad, while Diane worked as a business manager at the law firm Skadden in New York City,[7] and later as a chief operating officer at the law firm Thompson & Knight in Dallas.[12] Scheffler's interest in golf began at age three, when his parents gave him a set of plastic clubs and ball.[12] He practiced as a child by hitting ping-pong balls inside his home, curving the ball from one room to the next.[13] While living in New Jersey, Scheffler frequently asked his father to take him to the 9W Driving Range near the Hudson River. In winter, Scheffler's father shoveled snow from the range to allow him to still practice.[7] After the move to Dallas, his parents borrowed $50,000 to join Royal Oaks Country Club,[7] where Scheffler received tutelage under instructor Randy Smith, who coached Justin Leonard to a victory at the 1997 Open Championship.[12] At Royal Oaks, Scheffler also learned from professional golfers such as Justin Leonard, Ryan Palmer, Colt Knost, and Harrison Frazar. He watched them as they practiced, and from the age of nine would challenge them to chipping and putting contests.[14] He had prolific success at the youth level, and won 90 of the 136 tournaments he played on the Northern Texas PGA junior circuit, competing against the likes of fellow Dallas-area golfer Will Zalatoris.[15][16] Entering high school, Scheffler was barely 5 feet (1.5 m) in height, but experienced a large growth spurt and soon measured over 6 feet (1.8 m) tall.[15][17] He played golf and basketball at Highland Park High School in the Dallas enclave of University Park. At Highland Park, Scheffler won individual state titles three years in a row (2012 to 2014), matching a record set by fellow Texan Jordan Spieth. He also had success in AJGA events, and won the 2013 U.S. Junior Amateur, defeating Davis Riley 3 and 2.[18] Scheffler was the top-ranked junior golfer in the country in 2014.[15] He made his PGA Tour debut in May 2014, as a 17-year-old amateur at the HP Byron Nelson Championship. With his sister Callie caddying for him, he made the cut. He recorded a hole-in-one in the third round and ultimately finished at 4-under-par, in a tie for 22nd place. He was ineligible for the $60,000 payout due to his amateur status.[19] Scheffler was then recruited to play golf for the Texas Longhorns at the University of Texas at Austin beginning in 2014. He won his first individual collegiate title in April 2015, the Western Intercollegiate held at Pasatiempo Golf Club.[20] Two weeks later, Scheffler won the Big 12 Individual Championship held at Southern Hills Country Club.[21] He was named 2015 \"Phil Mickelson Freshman of the Year\" and Big 12 Newcomer of the Year due to these performances.[22] He struggled with back injuries during his sophomore season, and recorded only one top-10 finish.[17] Texas Longhorns head golf coach John Fields said Scheffler was still adapting to his physical growth: \"He's gone from 5-foot-2, 100 pounds in eighth grade to almost 6-foot-4, 200 pounds just six years later.\"[22] In June 2016, Scheffler qualified for his first U.S. Open. He opened with a first-round 69 and held the overnight lead,[23] but shot a second-round 78 to miss the cut by one stroke. He was then selected to represent the United States at the 2016 Eisenhower Trophy in September,[24] and won the East Lake Cup held at East Lake Golf Club in October.[25] Scheffler again qualified for the U.S. Open in 2017, after surviving a 4-for-3 playoff to earn a spot in the field.[26] He and Cameron Champ were the only two amateurs to make the cut at the 2017 U.S. Open.[27] Scheffler finished as low amateur at 1-under-par, one stroke ahead of Champ.[28] He was also part of the U.S. team that won the 2017 Walker Cup, where he defeated Connor Syme in the Sunday singles.[29] Scheffler became a member of the Texas Cowboys in the spring of 2017,[30][31] and graduated from the University of Texas at Austin's McCombs School of Business in 2018 with a bachelor's degree in finance.[17][32] In December 2018, Scheffler earned his 2019 Web.com Tour card through qualifying school.[33] On May 26, 2019, Scheffler fired a bogey-free, 9-under 63—playing the back nine in 30—to force a playoff with 54-hole leader Marcelo Rozo in the Evans Scholars Invitational. He then birdied the second extra hole for his first Web.com Tour victory.[34] On August 18, 2019, Scheffler won the Nationwide Children's Hospital Championship in Columbus, Ohio. Scheffler shot 4-under 67 in the final round at Ohio State University's Scarlet Course for a two-shot victory. He totaled a 12-under 272 for the week and finished two shots ahead of Brendon Todd, Beau Hossler and Ben Taylor. This event was part of the Korn Ferry Tour Finals (the Web.com Tour was renamed the Korn Ferry Tour in mid-season).[35] Scheffler led both the Finals points list and the overall points list to earn a fully exempt PGA Tour card for the 2020 season.[36] He was later named Korn Ferry Tour Player of the Year.[37] In his first start of 2020, Scheffler was tied for the lead alongside Andrew Landry after three rounds at The American Express. A final-round 70 saw Scheffler finish third, three shots behind Landry.[38] In August 2020, Scheffler finished tied for fourth at the 2020 PGA Championship.[39] On August 21, 2020, Scheffler shot a 12-under 59 at The Northern Trust. His round was the joint second-lowest in PGA Tour history and just the 12th sub-60 round in PGA Tour history.[40] Scheffler was named the PGA Tour Rookie of the Year for the 2019–20 season.[41] Scheffler recorded the first runner-up finish of his PGA Tour career in March 2021 at the WGC Match Play. He was defeated 2 & 1 by Billy Horschel in the final.[42] At the 2021 Masters Tournament, Scheffler tied for 18th. He then posted top-10 finishes at each of the three other majors: tied-8th at the 2021 PGA Championship, tied-7th at the 2021 U.S. Open, and tied-8th at the 2021 Open Championship.[43] In September 2021, Scheffler was named as a captain's pick by Steve Stricker for the U.S. team in the 2021 Ryder Cup at Whistling Straits in Kohler, Wisconsin. The U.S. team won 19–9 and Scheffler went 2–0–1 including a win in his Sunday singles match against world number one Jon Rahm.[44] Later that fall, he switched caddies, replacing Scott McGuinness with Bubba Watson's former caddie, Ted Scott.[45][46] On February 13, 2022, Scheffler won his first ever PGA Tour title at the WM Phoenix Open on the third hole of a sudden-death playoff against Patrick Cantlay.[47] Three weeks later, Scheffler won his second career PGA Tour title at the Arnold Palmer Invitational in Orlando, Florida. He won by one stroke over Viktor Hovland, Billy Horschel and Tyrrell Hatton.[48] Three weeks after that, Scheffler won the WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play in Austin, Texas, defeating Kevin Kisner in the final match. With this win, Scheffler moved to world number one in the Official World Golf Ranking.[49] On April 10, 2022, Scheffler won the Masters Tournament, defeating Rory McIlroy by three strokes. Scheffler became the fifth golfer to enter the Masters Tournament ranked No. 1 in the world and go on to win the Masters, joining Ian Woosnam (1991), Fred Couples (1992), Tiger Woods (2001, 2002) and Dustin Johnson (2020).[50] The victory was his fourth for the 2022 PGA Tour season, making him the first golfer since Arnold Palmer in 1960, and only the second ever, to win as many events including the Masters in that span of time to begin a season. It was his fourth win in his last 6 starts.[51][52] At the 2022 PGA Championship, he missed the cut by two, his first at the major since he turned pro in 2018.[53] On May 29, 2022, Scheffler lost the Charles Schwab Challenge in a playoff to Sam Burns after Burns made a 38-foot birdie putt.[54] At the U.S. Open, he finished T-2, one stroke behind the winner Matt Fitzpatrick. Entering the 2022 Tour Championship as the leader in the FedEx Cup standings, Scheffler started the tournament in first place with a 2-stroke lead in the starting strokes format. He extended his lead to 6 strokes after 54 holes, but shot a 3-over-par 73 in the final round to lose the tournament by one stroke to Rory McIlroy. This tied Scheffler for the PGA Tour record of largest 54-hole lead blown.[55][56] In September 2022, Scheffler was named 2022 PGA Tour Player of the Year, earning the Jack Nicklaus Award for the first time.[57] Scheffler qualified for the U.S. team at the 2022 Presidents Cup; he lost three of the four matches he played, tying the other.[58] In February 2023, Scheffler successfully defended his title at the WM Phoenix Open. He shot a final round 6-under 65 to beat Nick Taylor by two strokes. With the win, Scheffler returned to number one in the Official World Golf Ranking.[59] In March, Scheffler won The Players Championship by five strokes and regained the number one ranking in the Official World Golf Ranking for the second time in the year. It was the largest margin of victory in The Players Championship since Stephen Ames won by six in 2006.[60] Scheffler joined Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus as the only players to win the Masters Tournament and The Players Championship in a 12-month span.[61] As the defending champion at the 2023 Masters Tournament in April, Scheffler finished tied-10th.[62] At the 2023 PGA Championship in May, he posted a final-round 65 to tie for 2nd, two strokes behind Brooks Koepka. This result returned Scheffler to the number one spot in the Official World Golf Ranking.[63] Scheffler followed this with a 3rd-place finish at the 2023 U.S. Open in June.[64] In the 2022–23 season, Scheffler recorded 18 consecutive top-12 finishes, a streak only bettered by Tiger Woods in 2000–01.[65] For the second year in a row, he entered the Tour Championship as the leader in the FedEx Cup standings,[66] which gave him a starting score of 10-under-par, and a two stroke lead over Viktor Hovland. He finished in a tie for sixth place at 11-under-par, 16 strokes behind the winner, Hovland.[67] In September, Scheffler played on the U.S. team in the 2023 Ryder Cup at Marco Simone Golf and Country Club in Rome, Italy. The European team won 16.5–11.5 and Scheffler went 0–2–2, including a tie in his Sunday singles match against Jon Rahm.[68] In the Saturday morning foursome match, the European pair Ludvig Åberg and Viktor Hovland defeated Scheffler and Brooks Koepka 9 and 7, the biggest victory in an 18-hole match in Ryder Cup history.[69] In December, Scheffler won the Hero World Challenge, an unofficial event on the PGA Tour with a 20-man field. He had finished as runner-up in both of the previous two years at the tournament.[70][71] In March, Scheffler won the Arnold Palmer Invitational for the second time in his career. Scheffler ended the week at Bay Hill 15-under par, the lowest score since Rory McIlroy's 2018 win.[72] The following week, Scheffler won The Players Championship to become the first back-to-back winner in the event's history. Scheffler shot an 8-under 64 in the final round to overcome a five shot deficit, matching the largest comeback by a Players Championship winner at TPC Sawgrass.[73] In his next start at the Houston Open, Scheffler had a chance to win three events in a row. He was in the final group on Sunday and had a birdie putt from six feet on the 18th green to force a playoff. He missed the putt and finished in second place, one stroke behind Stephan Jäger.[74] In April, Scheffler won the Masters Tournament for a second time in three years. He finished 11-under par for the championship, winning by 4 shots over Ludvig Åberg of Sweden. Scheffler, aged 27, became the fourth-youngest player to have two Masters victories.[75] Scheffler additionally joined Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus as the only players to have multiple victories at both the Players Championship and the Masters.[76] One week later, he followed up his Masters victory with a win at the RBC Heritage for his 4th win in five starts.[77] At the 2024 PGA Championship at Valhalla Golf Club, Scheffler opened with a round of 67. On Friday morning prior to his second round, Scheffler was arrested after a traffic incident but was released in time to return to the course and shoot 66. However, in the third round, Scheffler broke his streak of 42 consecutive rounds of par-or-better on the PGA Tour with a two-over 73. He eventually finished the tournament tied 8th.[78][79][80] In his next start, Scheffler was in the final group on Sunday at the Charles Schwab Challenge. He ultimately finished runner-up, five strokes behind Davis Riley.[81][82] In June, Scheffler won the Memorial Tournament for his fifth win on the season. The win pushed him over $24 million in earnings for the year, breaking the PGA Tour season earnings record. Scheffler also become the first player since Tom Watson in 1980 to have won five times on the PGA Tour before the U.S. Open.[83] Two weeks later, Scheffler defeated Tom Kim in a sudden-death playoff at the Travelers Championship to claim his sixth win on the season. This made him the first PGA Tour golfer to win six times in a season since Tiger Woods in 2009, and the first to have won six times before July since Arnold Palmer in 1962.[84][85] As the number one player in the world rankings, Scheffler qualified as one of the four male golfers to represent the United States at the 2024 Paris Olympics in golf.[86] On August 4, he tied the course record at Le Golf National with a final-round 62 to finish at 19-under and win the gold medal.[87][88] Scheffler, who was six strokes behind the lead after the front nine, made six birdies on the back nine to win by one stroke over Tommy Fleetwood.[89][90] At the 2024 Tour Championship held at East Lake Golf Club, Scheffler entered as the leader in the FedEx Cup standings for third year in a row, starting again at 10-under-par. He totaled 30-under-par to claim the first FedEx Cup title of his career.[91] This made him the first player since Tiger Woods in 2007 to record a seven-win season on the PGA Tour,[92][93] and earned him $25 million in bonus prize money.[94][95] Along with the $8 million bonus for leading the regular-season standings and his $29 million official prize money, this brought Scheffler's total on-course earnings for the season to $62 million.[96][97] In December 2024, Scheffler won the Hero World Challenge for the second straight year. He finished at 25-under 263 to tie the tournament record at Albany Golf Course first set by Bubba Watson in 2015.[98] This was his ninth win of the year, although neither the Olympics or Hero World Challenge count as official PGA Tour wins.[99] Scheffler was named 2024 PGA Tour Player of the Year, earning the Jack Nicklaus Award for the third consecutive season, the first to do so since Tiger Woods in 2005–2007.[100][101] Later in December, Scheffler paired with Rory McIlroy against Brooks Koepka and Bryson Dechambeau in an edition of The Match billed as a showdown between the PGA Tour and LIV Golf. Scheffler and McIlroy won the 18-hole, match-play contest.[102][103] Scheffler met his wife, Meredith Scudder, in high school. They married in 2020.[104] On May 8, 2024, their first child was born, a son Bennett.[105][106] Scheffler is Catholic.[107][108] His sponsor for his confirmation in the Catholic Church was Rocky Hambric, founder of Hambric Sports, a sports management agency which has had Scheffler as a client since he turned professional.[16] Scheffler attends Bible study with his caddie Ted Scott, who caddied for Bubba Watson for 15 years. When requesting Scott to be his caddie, Scheffler said \"I really want to work with a Christian. That's how I try to live my life.\"[109] Scheffler and his close friend Sam Burns co-host an annual retreat with members of the College Golf Fellowship, a faith-based ministry.[110] Scheffler appears in the sports documentary series Full Swing, which premiered on Netflix in February 2023.[111] In August 2023, Scheffler became an investor in the Texas Ranchers, a pickleball team.[112] On May 17, 2024, Scheffler was arrested at 6:20 a.m. near Valhalla Golf Club, the venue of the 2024 PGA Championship.[113] He was charged with second-degree assault of a police officer, a class-C felony, and three misdemeanors: third-degree criminal mischief, reckless driving, and disregarding traffic signals from an officer directing traffic.[114] Scheffler was released on his own recognizance at 8:40 the same morning.[115] The charges against Scheffler were dropped on May 29. Both Scheffler and the Louisville Metro Police Department agreed to not pursue legal action related to his arrest.[116] Prosecutor Mike O'Connell stated that Scheffler's characterization of the incident as \"'a big misunderstanding' is corroborated by the evidence.\"[117] Source:[118] 1Started tournament at −10 FedEx Cup playoffs adjustment, scored −20 to par.

                "content": "Scottie Scheffler has made a rapid journey to the top of the golf world. At the start of 2022, he was a rising star in the PGA Tour, without a title win yet ranked 13th in the world. However, by April of that year, the American star had shattered expectations, securing four PGA Tour titles, including a maiden win at the Masters, propelling him to the summit of the World Golf Ranking. Scheffler was introduced to golf at age three courtesy of a set of plastic clubs and ball. Following the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001, the family moved to Dallas, Texas. He went on to dominate at youth level, winning 75 events between 2004 and 2010. While at Highland Park High School, Scheffler followed Jordan Spieth (2009-11) in winning three consecutive individual state titles from 2012-14. In 2013, he won the U.S. Junior Amateur title and was the top-ranked junior golfer in the country in 2014. Transitioning to collegiate golf, Scheffler excelled at the University of Texas, helping the team win three Big 12 championships and advance to the match play finals of the NCAA Championship three times—winning Freshman of the Year along the way. He made two appearances at the US Open, missing the cut in 2016 before finishing tied for 27th in 2017 to win the low amateur prize. The amateur sensation turned professional in late 2018. In his first full year on the Korn Ferry Tour, he won three titles to finish atop the points list and earn a PGA Tour card for the 2020 season. August 2020 was a momentous month for Scheffler as he finished tied for fourth at the PGA Championship before shooting a 59 at the Northern Trust, the 12th sub-60 round in PGA history. He was named PGA Tour Rookie of the Year and his consistent performances earned him a spot in USA's victorious 2021 Ryder Cup team. With Bubba Watson's former caddie Ted Scott on the bag, Scheffler had a 2022 to remember. In February, he clinched his first PGA Tour title at the Phoenix Open and continued in the winning habit. In the next two months, he had further wins at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, the WGC Match Play, and a first major triumph at the Masters where he beat Rory McIlroy by three shots. Those wins saw him go top of the world rankings and, while he was unable to win again in 2022 and lost his number one ranking at the year's end, he was still named 2022 PGA Tour Player of the Year. His ball-striking was statistically on a par with Tiger Woods' in his annus mirabilis of 2000 with just Scheffler's putting letting him down on occasion. In 2023, Scheffler retained his Phoenix Open title before securing a first victory in golf's unofficial fifth major, the PLAYERS Championship at Sawgrass. But it was in 2024 that Scheffler really took his game to another level. Not long after McIlroy suggested he should try a mallet putter, Scheffler tried one for the Arnold Palmer Invitational. His touch on the green was transformed as he holed every putt from inside 15 feet to regain the title. He then retained his PLAYERS crown despite a neck injury which stopped him swinging the club at full speed. After a close second at the Texas Houston Open, Scheffler won the Masters at Augusta by four strokes from Ludvig Åberg to claim his second Green Jacket. Scheffler's hot streak continued with victory at the RBC Heritage making it four wins in five tournaments. With a big lead in the world rankings and his form showing no sign of deserting him, the American arrived for his Olympic debut at Paris 2024 as one of the favourites for the gold medal. Seemingly unfazed by any external pressure or expectations, Scheffler pulled off a 9-under 62 to earn his first (and USA’s third) Olympic gold medal in the men’s individual competition. Following the competition, Scheffler spoke to Olympics.com about what becoming an Olympic champion meant to him: “It's tough to compare accomplishments, but an Olympic gold medal is definitely going to be one of my special memories when I look back on my career.” Athlete Olympic Results Content You may like",

                "content": "This is an accepted version of this page Sven Magnus Øen Carlsen[a] (born 30 November 1990) is a Norwegian chess grandmaster. Carlsen is a five-time World Chess Champion, the reigning five-time World Rapid Chess Champion, the reigning seven-time World Blitz Chess Champion and the reigning Chess World Cup Champion. He has held the No. 1 position in the FIDE world chess rankings since 1 July 2011 and trails only Garry Kasparov in time spent as the highest-rated player in the world.[1] His peak rating of 2882 is the highest in history. He also holds the record for the longest unbeaten streak at an elite level in classical chess at 125 games.[2][3] A chess prodigy, Carlsen finished first in the C group of the Corus chess tournament shortly after he turned 13 and earned the title of grandmaster a few months later. At 15, he won the Norwegian Chess Championship, and later became the youngest ever player to qualify for the Candidates Tournament in 2005.[1] At 17, he finished joint first in the top group of Corus. He surpassed a rating of 2800 at 18, the youngest at the time to do so. In 2010, at 19, he reached No. 1 in the FIDE world rankings, the youngest person ever to do so. Carlsen became World Chess Champion in 2013 by defeating Viswanathan Anand. He retained his title against Anand the following year and won both the 2014 World Rapid Championship and World Blitz Championship, becoming the first player to hold all three titles simultaneously, a feat which he repeated in 2019 and 2022.[4][5] He defended his classical world title against Sergey Karjakin in 2016, Fabiano Caruana in 2018, and Ian Nepomniachtchi in 2021. Carlsen declined to defend his title in 2023, citing a lack of motivation.[6] Known for his attacking style as a teenager, Carlsen has since developed into a universal player. He uses a variety of openings to make it harder for opponents to prepare against him and reduce the utility of pre-game computer analysis.[7] Carlsen was born in Tønsberg, Norway, on 30 November 1990[8][9] to Sigrun Øen (1963–2024), a chemical engineer, and Henrik Albert Carlsen, an IT consultant.[10] The family spent one year in Espoo, Finland, and then in Brussels, Belgium, before returning to Norway in 1998, where they lived in Lommedalen, Bærum. They later moved to Haslum.[11] Carlsen showed an aptitude for intellectual challenges at a young age. At two years, he could solve 500-piece jigsaw puzzles; at four, he enjoyed assembling Lego sets with instructions intended for children aged 10–14.[12] His father, a keen amateur chess player,[13] taught him to play at age five, although he initially showed little interest in it.[14] He has three sisters, and in 2010 stated that one thing that first motivated him to take up chess seriously was the desire to beat his elder sister at the game.[15] The first chess book Carlsen read was a booklet named Find the Plan by Bent Larsen,[16] and his first book on openings was Eduard Gufeld's The Complete Dragon.[17] Carlsen developed his early chess skills playing by himself for hours on end—moving the pieces around, searching for combinations, and replaying games and positions his father showed him. Simen Agdestein emphasises Carlsen's exceptional memory, stating that he was able to recall the locations, populations, flags and capitals of all the countries in the world by age five. Later, he memorised the locations, populations, coats-of-arms and administrative centres of \"virtually all\" 356 Norwegian municipalities.[18] He participated in his first tournament—the youngest division of the 1999 Norwegian Chess Championship—at 8 years and 7 months, and scored 6/11.[19] Carlsen was coached at the Norwegian College of Elite Sport by the country's top player, Grandmaster (GM) Simen Agdestein,[10] who in turn cites Norwegian football manager Egil \"Drillo\" Olsen as a key inspiration for his coaching strategy.[20] In 2000, Agdestein introduced Carlsen to Torbjørn Ringdal Hansen, a former Norwegian junior champion and later International Master (IM) and Grandmaster (GM),[21] as Ringdal served a one-year siviltjeneste (an alternative civilian service programme) at the college. Over the course of that year, Carlsen's rating rose from 904 in June 2000 to 1907. His breakthrough occurred in the Norwegian junior teams championship in September 2000, where he scored 3½/5 against the country's top junior players and gained a tournament performance rating (TPR) of around 2000.[22] Apart from chess, which he studied about three to four hours a day, his favourite pastimes included playing football and reading Donald Duck comics.[23] He also practised skiing until age ten.[24] From autumn 2000 to the end of 2002, Carlsen played almost 300 rated tournament games, as well as in several blitz tournaments, and participated in other minor events.[25] In October 2002, he placed sixth in the European Under-12 Championship in Peñiscola.[26] The following month, he tied for first place in the 2002 World Under-12 Championship in Heraklion, placing second to Ian Nepomniachtchi on tiebreak.[27] He then obtained three IM norms in relatively quick succession: the first at the January 2003 Gausdal Troll Masters (score 7/10, 2453 PR); the second at the June 2003 Salongernas IM-tournament in Stockholm (6/9, 2470 PR); and the third at the July 2003 Politiken Cup in Copenhagen (8/11, 2503 PR). He was officially awarded the IM title on 20 August 2003.[28] After finishing primary school, Carlsen took a year off to participate in international chess tournaments in Europe during the autumn of 2003, then returned to complete secondary education at a sports school.[29][30] During the year away from school, he placed joint-third in the European Under-14 Championship[31] and ninth in the 2003 World Under-14 Championship.[32] Carlsen made headlines after his victory, at the age of 13, in the C group at the 2004 Corus chess tournament in Wijk aan Zee.[33] He obtained a score of 10½/13, losing just one game (against the highest-rated player of the C group, Duško Pavasovič).[34] As a result, he earned his first GM norm, and achieved a PR of 2702. Particularly notable was his win over Sipke Ernst in the penultimate round, when he sacrificed material to give mate in just 29 moves.[35] His victory in the C group qualified him to play in the B group in 2005, and it led Lubomir Kavalek, writing for the Washington Post, to give him the title \"the Mozart of chess\" (although, as pointed out by Edward Winter, the nickname had been given to many illustrious predecessors).[36] Agdestein said that Carlsen had an excellent memory and played an unusually wide range of openings.[37] Carlsen's prowess caught the attention of Microsoft, which became his sponsor.[38] Carlsen obtained his second GM norm at the Moscow Aeroflot Open in February. On 17 March, in a blitz chess tournament in Reykjavík, Iceland, he defeated former World Champion Anatoly Karpov. It was a preliminary event leading up to a rapid knockout tournament beginning the next day. In that event, Carlsen was paired with Garry Kasparov, then the top-rated player in the world. Carlsen achieved a draw in their first game but lost the second, and was thus knocked out of the tournament.[39] In the sixth Dubai Open Chess Championship, held 18–28 April, Carlsen obtained his third GM norm, which made him the world's youngest GM at the time, and the second-youngest GM in history at the time (after Sergey Karjakin, who earned the title at 12 years and 7 months).[40] Carlsen played in the FIDE World Chess Championship, becoming the youngest player ever to participate in one, but was knocked out in the first round by Levon Aronian.[41] In July, Carlsen and Berge Østenstad, then the reigning Norwegian champion, tied for first in the Norwegian Chess Championship, each scoring 7/9. A two-game match between them was arranged to decide the title. Both games were drawn, which left Østenstad the champion because he had superior tiebreaks in the tournament.[42] In the Smartfish Chess Masters event at the Drammen International Chess Festival 2004–05, Carlsen defeated Alexei Shirov, then ranked No. 10[43] in the world, as well as the co-winner of the tournament.[44] In the semi-finals of the Ciudad de León rapid chess tournament in June, Carlsen played a four-game match against Viswanathan Anand, who was ranked No. 2 in the world at the time and had won the 2003 World Rapid Chess Championship.[45] Anand won 3–1.[46] In the Norwegian Chess Championship, Carlsen again finished in shared first place, this time with his mentor Simen Agdestein. A playoff between them was played between 7 and 10 November. This time, Carlsen had the better tiebreaks, but the rule giving the title to the player with better tiebreak scores in the event of a 1–1 tie had been revoked. The match was closely fought—Agdestein won the first game, Carlsen the second—so it went into a series of two-game rapid matches until there was a winner. Carlsen won the first rapid game, Agdestein the second. Then followed three draws until Agdestein won the championship title with a victory in the sixth rapid game.[47] In October, Carlsen took first place at the Arnold Eikrem Memorial in Gausdal with a score of 8/9 and a PR of 2792.[48] At the end of 2005, Carlsen participated at the Chess World Cup in Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia. In the knockout tournament, he upset 44th-ranked Zurab Azmaiparashvili in round one, and proceeded to defeat Farrukh Amonatov and Ivan Cheparinov to reach the round of 16. There he lost to Evgeny Bareev,[49] but won against Joël Lautier and Vladimir Malakhov before losing again to Gata Kamsky. Carlsen finished in tenth place and became the youngest player to be an official World Championship Candidate.[50] Carlsen qualified for a place in the Corus B group due to his first-place finish in Corus group C in 2004. His shared first place with Alexander Motylev with 9/13 (+6−1=6) qualified him to play in the Corus group A in 2007.[51] At the 2006 international 'Bosna' tournament in Sarajevo, Carlsen shared first place with Liviu-Dieter Nisipeanu (who won on tiebreak evaluation) and Vladimir Malakhov; this could be regarded as Carlsen's first \"A\" elite tournament win, although it was not a clear first.[52] Carlsen was close to winning the 2006 Norwegian Chess Championship outright, but a last-round loss to Berge Østenstad dropped him into another tie for first place with Agdestein. It also prevented Carlsen from beating Agdestein's record as the youngest Norwegian champion ever.[53] Nonetheless, in the playoff held from 19 to 21 September, Carlsen won 3–1. After two draws at standard time controls, Carlsen won both rapid games in round two, securing his first Norwegian championship win.[54] Carlsen won the Glitnir Blitz Tournament in Iceland.[55] He achieved a 2–0 win over Viswanathan Anand in the semi-finals and achieved the same score in the finals.[56] He scored 6/8 in the 37th Chess Olympiad and achieved a PR of 2820.[57] In the Midnight Sun Chess Tournament in Tromsø, Carlsen finished second to Sergei Shipov.[58] In the Biel Grandmaster Tournament, he placed second, beating the tournament winner Alexander Morozevich twice.[59] In the NH Chess Tournament held in Amsterdam in August, Carlsen participated in an \"Experience\" vs. \"Rising Stars\" Scheveningen team match.

Eventually, Aronian eliminated Carlsen from the tournament after winning both tiebreak blitz games.[67] In July and August, Carlsen won the Biel Grandmaster Tournament with a 6/10 record and a PR of 2753. His score was matched by Alexander Onischuk and they played a match to break the tie. After drawing two rapid and two blitz games, Carlsen won the armageddon game.[68] Immediately after the Biel tournament, Carlsen entered the open Arctic Chess Challenge in Tromsø, but his fourth-place result with +5=4 was a slight underperformance in terms of rating. In the first round, Carlsen conceded a draw to his classmate Brede Hagen (rated 2034)[69] after having a lost position at one point.[70] A game which attracted some attention was his sixth-round win over his father, Henrik Carlsen.[71] Carlsen reached the semi-final round of the World Chess Cup in December, after defeating Michael Adams in the round of 16 and Ivan Cheparinov in the quarterfinals. In the semi-final, he was eliminated by the eventual winner, Gata Kamsky, scoring ½–1½.[72] In the top group A of the 69th Corus chess tournament, Carlsen scored 8/13, achieving a PR of 2830.

He finished in sole second place, ½ point behind the winner World Champion Viswanathan Anand.[74] In March, Carlsen played for the second time in the Melody Amber blind and rapid chess tournament, held in Nice for the first time. In the 11 rounds he achieved four wins, four draws and two losses in the blindfold, and three wins, two losses, and six draws in the rapid. This resulted in a shared fifth place in the blindfold, shared third place in the rapid and a shared second place in the overall tournament.[75] Carlsen was one of 21 players in the six-tournament FIDE Grand Prix 2008–2010, a qualifier for the World Chess Championship 2012. In the first tournament, in Baku, Azerbaijan, he finished in a three-way tie for first place, with another 2800 PR. He later withdrew from the Grand Prix cycle despite his initial success, criticising FIDE for \"changing the rules dramatically in the middle of a World Championship cycle\".[76] Carlsen won a rapid match against Peter Leko held in Miskolc, Hungary, scoring 5–3.[77] In June, Carlsen won the annual Aerosvit chess tournament,[78] finishing undefeated with 8/11 in a category 19 field and achieving a PR of 2877, his best PR at that point in his career.[79] Playing in the category 18 Biel Grandmaster Tournament, Carlsen finished third with 6/10, with a PR of 2740.[80] In the Mainz World Rapid Chess Championship, Carlsen finished in second place after losing the final to defending champion Anand 3–1.[81] In the qualification round Carlsen scored 1½–½ against Judit Polgár, 1–1 against Anand and 1–1 against Alexander Morozevich.[82] In the category 22 Bilbao Masters, Carlsen tied for second with a 2768 PR.[83] Playing in Group A of the 71st Corus chess tournament, Carlsen tied for fifth with a 2739 PR.[84] In the Linares chess tournament, he finished third with a 2777 PR.[85] He tied for second place with Veselin Topalov at the M-Tel Masters (category 21) tournament in Sofia, Bulgaria.

He scored an undefeated 8/10, winning every game as white (against Topalov, Wang Yue, Leko, Teimour Radjabov, and Dmitry Jakovenko), and also winning as black against Jakovenko. By rating performance, this was one of the greatest results in history, with a PR of 3002.[87] Chess statistician Jeff Sonas has declared it one of the 20 best tournament performances of all time, and the best chess performance of all time by a teenager.[88] In the Tal Memorial, played from 5 to 14 November, Carlsen started with seven straight draws, but finished with wins over former FIDE World Champion Ruslan Ponomariov and Peter Leko. This result put Carlsen in shared second place behind former World Champion Vladimir Kramnik and equal with Ivanchuk.[89][90] After the Tal Memorial, Carlsen won the World Blitz Championship, played from 16 to 18 November in Moscow, Russia. His score of 28 wins, 6 draws and 8 losses left him three points ahead of Anand, who finished in second place.[91] Carlsen entered the London Chess Classic as the top seed in a field including Kramnik, Hikaru Nakamura, Michael Adams, Nigel Short, Ni Hua, Luke McShane and David Howell. He defeated Kramnik in round one and went on to win the tournament with 13/21 (three points were awarded for a win, and one for a draw; using classical scoring he finished with 5/7) and a PR of 2844, one point ahead of Kramnik. This victory propelled him to No. 1 of the FIDE rating list, surpassing Veselin Topalov.[92][93] Based on his average ranking from the July 2009 and January 2010 FIDE lists, Carlsen qualified for the Candidates Tournament that would determine the challenger to World Champion Viswanathan Anand in the World Chess Championship 2012. In November 2010, however, Carlsen announced he was withdrawing from the Candidates Tournament. Carlsen described the 2008–12 cycle as \"[not] sufficiently modern and fair\", and wrote that \"Reigning champion privileges, the long (five-year) span of the cycle, changes made during the cycle resulting in a new format (Candidates) that no World Champion has had to go through since Kasparov, puzzling ranking criteria as well as the shallow ceaseless match-after-match concept are all less than satisfactory in my opinion.\"[94] In early 2009 Carlsen engaged former World Champion Garry Kasparov as a personal trainer.[95] In September their partnership was revealed to the public by Norwegian newspapers.[96][97] Responding to a question in an interview with Time magazine in December 2009 as to whether he used computers when studying chess, Carlsen explained that he does not use a chess set when studying on his own.[98] Carlsen won the 72nd Corus chess tournament played 16–31 January with 8½ points. His ninth-round loss to Kramnik ended a streak of 36 rated games undefeated.[99] Carlsen struggled in the last round against Fabiano Caruana, but saved a draw, leaving him half a point ahead of Kramnik and Shirov.[100] In March it was announced that Carlsen had split from Kasparov and would no longer use him as a trainer,[101] although Carlsen later stated that they would remain in contact and he would continue to attend training sessions with Kasparov.[102] Carlsen shared first place alongside Ivanchuk in the Amber blindfold and rapid tournament. Scoring 6½/11 in the blindfold and 8/11 in the rapid, Carlsen accumulated 14½ from a possible 22 points.[103] Carlsen helped Anand prepare for the World Chess Championship 2010 against Veselin Topalov, which Anand won 6½–5½ to retain the title. Carlsen had also helped Anand prepare for the World Chess Championships in 2007 and 2008.[104] Carlsen won the Bazna Kings Tournament in Romania in June, two points ahead of Radjabov and Boris Gelfand.[105] In August, Carlsen played in the Arctic Securities Chess Stars tournament in Kristiansund, Norway., defeating Anand 1½–½ in the two-game final to win the championship.[106] Carlsen suffered setbacks in his next two tournaments. In the 39th Chess Olympiad he scored 4½/8, losing three games, to Baadur Jobava, Michael Adams, and Sanan Sjugirov; these were his first losses with the black pieces in more than a year.[107] His team, Norway, finished 51st out of 149 teams.[108] Carlsen played in the Grand Slam Masters Final in October, which he had qualified for automatically by winning three of the previous year's four Grand Slam chess events.[109][110] The average Elo of the participants at the time was 2789, making the Grand Slam Final the strongest chess tournament in history. In the first round, Carlsen lost with black to Kramnik; this was Carlsen's second consecutive loss to Kramnik, and placed his hold on the world No. 1 ranking in jeopardy. In his second round, Carlsen lost with the white pieces to Anand; this was his first loss as White since January 2010. Carlsen recovered somewhat in the latter part of the tournament, achieving a win over Shirov, and finishing with 2½/6; Kramnik won the event with 4/6.[111] In October, Carlsen competed at the Pearl Spring chess tournament in Nanjing, China.[112] This was the only tournament in 2010 to feature Anand, Carlsen and Topalov, at the time the top three players in the world, and was the first tournament in history to feature three players rated at least 2800. Carlsen secured first place by defeating Topalov with black. This was his second victory in the tournament over the former world No. 1; his final score of 7/10 (with a PR of 2903) was a full point ahead of runner-up Anand.[113] On 5 November, Carlsen withdrew from the 2011 Candidates Tournament, having qualified as the highest rated challenger, citing dissatisfaction with the World Championship cycle format.[114] In the World Blitz Championship, held in Moscow in November, Carlsen finished third with a score of 23½/38, behind Radjabov and winner Levon Aronian.[115] After the tournament, Carlsen played a private 40-game blitz match against Hikaru Nakamura,[116] winning with a score of 24½–15½.[117] Carlsen won the London Chess Classic in December, ahead of Anand and McShane.[118] Carlsen competed in the GM-A group of the 73rd Tata Steel Chess Tournament (formerly called the Corus chess tournament) on 14–30 January in Wijk aan Zee in an attempt to defend his title; the field included World Champion Viswanathan Anand, Levon Aronian, former World Champion Vladimir Kramnik, Alexander Grischuk, Hikaru Nakamura, Ruslan Ponomariov, among others. Despite losing games with white against Anish Giri and reigning Russian champion Ian Nepomniachtchi, Carlsen finished with 8/13, including victories over Kramnik and tournament winner Nakamura.[119] Although Carlsen's performance raised his rating from 2814 to 2815, Anand's 8½/13 score elevated his rating to 2817, making him the world No. 1 for the March 2011 FIDE rating list.[120] The first tournament victory of the year came in the Bazna Kings tournament, a double round robin played in Mediaș, Romania on 11–21 June. Carlsen finished with 6½/10, equal with Sergey Karjakin but with a better tiebreak score.

He took clear first place with a score of 19/30 (+5−1=4; three points for a win) in a field comprising Fabiano Caruana, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, Alexander Morozevich, Alexey Shirov and Yannick Pelletier, two points ahead of Morozevich. This was Carlsen's second title.[122][123] The Grand Slam Chess Final was held as a double round robin with six players, in São Paulo (25 September – 1 October) and Bilbao (5–11 October). Although Carlsen had a slow start, including a loss against bottom-ranked Francisco Vallejo Pons, he finished +3−1=6, equal with Ivanchuk (whose +4−3=3 finish was equal due to three points for a win). Carlsen then won the blitz tiebreak against Ivanchuk. The other players were Anand, Aronian, Nakamura, and Vallejo Pons.[124] Another tournament victory was achieved in the Tal Memorial in Moscow 16–25 November as a round robin with ten players. Carlsen won two games, against Gelfand and Nakamura, and drew the rest. Although he finished equal on points with Aronian, he placed ahead since the tiebreak was determined by the number of black games; Carlsen had five black games, while Aronian only had four.[125][126] In the London Chess Classic, played 3–12 December, Carlsen's streak of tournament victories ended when he finished third, behind Kramnik and Nakamura. Carlsen won three games and drew five.

As in the Tal Memorial earlier in 2012, Carlsen managed to finish the tournament without any losses (+4−0=6). He also defeated the winner Wang in both of their individual games. In the exhibition blitz tournament at Biel before the GM tournament, Carlsen was eliminated (+1−2=0) in the first round by Étienne Bacrot. Bacrot deprived Carlsen of a win in the classical tournament by holding him to a draw in the final round. Carlsen would have won the classical tournament on the traditional 1–½–0 scoring system, with 7/10.[130] The Grand Slam Chess Final was again held as a double round robin with six players, in São Paulo and Bilbao. Carlsen started with a loss against Caruana, but after three wins in the second (Bilbao) round, finished +4−1=5, equal first with Caruana, and ahead of Aronian, Karjakin and Anand. Carlsen won the tournament by winning both tiebreak games against Caruana.[131] From 24 to 25 November, Carlsen took part in the chess festival \"Segunda Gran Fiesta Internacional de Ajedrez\" in Mexico City. As part of it, Carlsen took on an online audience (dubbed as \"The World\") with the white pieces and won. He then took part in the knockout exhibition event \"Cuadrangular UNAM\". Carlsen first beat Lázaro Bruzón 1½–½, thus qualifying for a final against Judit Polgár (who had in turn beat Manuel León Hoyos 1½–½).

In the 13-round tournament, he scored 10 points (+7−0=6), winning clear first 1½ points ahead of second-place finisher Aronian.[137] On 1 February, Danish GM Peter Heine Nielsen joined the team of assistants who helped Carlsen prepare for the Candidates Tournament in March. Before this, Nielsen was on Viswanathan Anand's team.[138] Carlsen played in the 2013 Candidates Tournament, which took place in London, from 15 March to 1 April. He finished with +5−2=7, and won the tournament on tiebreak over Vladimir Kramnik.

He had his first win in game 5 by taking advantage of a small mistake by Anand, and emerged victorious in games 6 and 9, making him the 16th undisputed World Chess Champion. From 29 January to 4 February, Carlsen played in the Zurich Chess Challenge, winning the blitz event (+2−1=2) and the classical event (+3−0=2). He fared worse in the rapid event (+1−2=2), which counted towards the overall standings, but retained enough of a lead to win the tournament. The other players in the event were Aronian, Nakamura, Caruana, Gelfand and Anand.[145] On 22 March, Carlsen played a game for his club Stavanger in the final team match for promotion to the Norwegian Premier League.

After 11 of 12 games, Carlsen led 6½–4½, thereby defending his World Champion title.[154] In January, Carlsen won the 77th Tata Steel Chess Tournament, which was played mainly in Wijk aan Zee on 9–25 January. Carlsen had a poor start to the tournament with two draws and a loss in the third round to Radosław Wojtaszek, which left him in tenth place among the fourteen players. However, six consecutive wins thrust Carlsen into clear first place. Drawing the final four games was sufficient to win the tournament with 9 points out of 13, half a point ahead of Anish Giri, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, Wesley So and Ding Liren.[155][156] In February, Carlsen won the 3rd Grenke Chess Classic after a five-game tiebreak with Arkadij Naiditsch. Carlsen had finished joint first with Naiditsch on 4½/7, beating Michael Adams, Anand, and David Baramidze, and losing to Naiditsch in their classical encounter.[157] This tournament victory meant that Carlsen began 2015 by winning two out of two tournaments. Carlsen continued his streak in April, winning Shamkir Chess with a score of 7/9 (+5−0=4), defeating Mamedyarov, Caruana, Vachier-Lagrave, Kramnik, and Rauf Mamedov.

In the first round he obtained a winning position against Topalov after pressing in a long endgame, only to lose on time when he mistakenly thought that he would receive 15 minutes of extra time at move 60.[159] He was then outplayed by Caruana in the second round, missed a win against Anish Giri in round 3, and lost to Anand in round 4. He won against Grischuk in round 5, drew against Nakamura and Vachier-Lagrave in rounds 6 and 7, and defeated Aronian in round 8, but he lost the last round against Jon Ludvig Hammer, leaving him in seventh place and with a performance rating of 2693.[160] Carlsen said of this result: \"It's just extremely frustrating not to be able to show anything close to what I am capable of in my home country.\"[161] From 22 August to 3 September, Carlsen played in the 2015 Sinquefield Cup. He finished in second place with 5/9 (+3−2=4), one point behind winner Levon Aronian.

He started off poorly, scoring ½ points out of 3 games, losing to Levon Aronian, drawing against Sune Berg Hansen, and losing again to Yannick Pelletier due to a blunder. However, he finished the tournament strongly, scoring victories against Peter Leko and Radoslaw Wojtaszek, the latter of whom he had lost to earlier in the year, but his performance was not enough to earn his team a medal, and he lost 16 rating points during the event.[166] From 4–13 December, Carlsen participated in the final leg of the Grand Chess Tour, the London Chess Classic. He scored 5½/9 (+2−0=7) in the event, defeating Nakamura (thus inflicting Nakamura's 12th classical loss to Carlsen) and Grischuk, and finished joint first with Anish Giri and Maxime Vachier-Lagrave. In the 3-way tiebreak, Carlsen was the top seed, meaning he faced the winner of the first tie-break match between Giri and Vachier-Lagrave. Carlsen eventually won the tournament by defeating Vachier-Lagrave, which meant he also won the overall Grand Chess Tour.[167] Carlsen then played in the second edition of the Qatar Masters Open, which was held from 20 to 29 December.

Karjakin drew first blood by winning game 8, but Carlsen equalised the match in game 10. Games 11 and 12 were both drawn. The tiebreaking games were held on 30 November, Carlsen's 26th birthday. After drawing games 1 and 2, Carlsen won games 3 and 4 to record a 3–1 victory and retain his World Champion title. In January, Carlsen participated in the 79th Tata Steel Chess Tournament. He started well, scoring 2 wins and 4 draws in his first 6 games, but missed mate-in-3 versus Giri in round 7, which Giri described as \"the most embarrassing moment\" of Carlsen's career.[178] Carlsen then lost in round 8 to Richárd Rapport, and ultimately placed second with 8/13 (+4−1=8), one point behind winner Wesley So.[179] From 13 to 22 April, Carlsen competed in the 4th Grenke Chess Classic, finishing in joint second place, though third on tiebreaks, with Fabiano Caruana, with a score of 4/7 (+1−0=6).

As a result, Carlsen's FIDE rating dropped to 2832, his lowest since November 2011 (2826).[180] Carlsen participated in the fifth edition of Norway Chess from 6 to 16 June. He performed poorly and had a performance rating of 2755, his lowest since 2015 (2670, at the European Team Chess Championship).

His participation in the event as World Champion was unusual as the World Cup is part of the cycle to challenge the World Champion in 2018.[188] He defeated Oluwafemi Balogun +2−0=0 in the first round to advance to the second round, where he defeated Aleksey Dreev +2−0=0.

My confidence is long gone ... At this point I just don't care anymore and I'm just waiting for the classical to start.\"[222] The fifth leg, the 7th Sinquefield Cup, was a classical tournament. Carlsen won his last two games to tie for first on 6½/11 (+2−0=9) with Ding, but lost the tiebreak 1–3, drawing both rapid games then losing two consecutive blitz games.[223] At the FIDE Grand Swiss Tournament 2019 held in October on the Isle of Man, Carlsen placed sixth with 7½/11 (+4−0=7).

Billed as \"the first professional online chess tournament,\" the eight-player rapid tournament was held from 18 April to 3 May, with a $250,000 prize fund. The first phase consisted of a single round-robin, after which the top four players would advance to the playoffs.[232] Carlsen won the event by defeating Hikaru Nakamura 2½–1½ in the final.[233] Carlsen competed in the 8th Norway Chess from 5 to 16 October, which was the first elite over-the-board tournament held since social restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic were enforced.[234] During the tournament, Carlsen's unbeaten streak in classical chess was ended by Jan-Krzysztof Duda.[235] Carlsen had gone 125 games without defeat, a period spanning 2 years, 2 months and 10 days.[234] He ultimately won the tournament with a round to spare,[236] finishing on 19½ points, one point ahead of runner-up Alireza Firouzja.[237] In January, Carlsen participated in the 83rd Tata Steel Chess Tournament. He finished in sixth place with a score of 7½/13, losing one game to young Russian grandmaster Andrey Esipenko.[238] This was Carlsen's first loss to a teenager (at standard time controls) since 2011,[239] and his first loss to a sub-2700 rated player since 2015.[240] Throughout the year, Carlsen also participated in many online chess tournaments as part of the Meltwater Champions Chess Tour. At the FIDE World Cup 2021 held in Sochi, Carlsen won the third place match against Fedoseev after being defeated in the semi-finals by Duda, who eventually won the event.[241] Carlsen then won the 9th Norway Chess, again finishing on 19½ points ahead of runner-up Alireza Firouzja. After his sole loss in the fifth round of the classical portion to Karjakin, Carlsen won four straight games in classical chess against Firouzja, Tari, Karjakin, and Rapport before ending the tournament with a classical draw and armageddon win against his future World Championship challenger Ian Nepomniachtchi.[242] From 26 to 28 December, Carlsen participated in the World Rapid Chess Championship 2021. He took 3rd place (by tiebreakers) with a score of 9½/13 (+7-1=5). Over the next two days, from 29 to 30 December he took part in the World Blitz Chess Championship 2021. He performed poorly, finishing 12th with a score of 13½/21 (+12−6=3). At the 2021 World Chess Championship, Carlsen defeated challenger Ian Nepomniachtchi in Game 6 after drawing the first five games. It was the first decisive result in a classical time limit World Chess Championship game in more than 5 years and at 136 moves was also the longest game in World Chess Championship history.[243] Subsequently, Carlsen also defeated Nepomniachtchi in Games 8, 9, and 11, thus retaining his championship title.[244] After the match, Carlsen announced that \"Unless Firouzja wins the Candidates Tournament, it is unlikely that I will play the next world championship match.\"[245] In January, Carlsen won his eighth Tata Steel Chess Tournament. He finished with a score of 9½/13, with no losses and six wins, including wins against Shakhriyar Mamedyarov and Fabiano Caruana.[246] In early June, Carlsen placed first in the Norway Chess Tournament, ahead of Shakhriyar Mamedyarov and Viswanathan Anand who finished second and third, respectively.[247] He finished with a score of 16½/30,[247] with no losses and three wins, including wins against Teimour Radjabov, Anish Giri and Shakhriyar Mamedyarov. This was Carlsen's fourth consecutive win of the prestigious super tournament and fifth overall in the last decade. On 20 July, the deadline FIDE had given him, Carlsen announced that he would not defend his World Championship title against Nepomniachtchi in the 2023 World Chess Championship match.[248] Carlsen said he enjoyed playing chess tournaments more than championships,[249] and would still continue playing professional chess.[250] Throughout the year, Carlsen competed in the Champions Chess Tour 2022.[251] He won the Airthings Masters, Charity Cup, and FTX Crypto Cup. Carlsen joined the Norway team for the 44th Chess Olympiad.[251] He was the runner-up in the Chess.com Speed Championship.[252] Carlsen won the World Rapid Chess Championship 2022 with a score of 10/13 (+8-1=4). He also won the World Blitz Chess Championship 2022 with a score of 16/21 (+13-2=6). This marks the third time in Carlsen's career that he has simultaneously held the Classical, Rapid, and Blitz World Titles, with 2014 and 2019 being the other two occurrences. In August and September, Carlsen participated as a wildcard in the 2022 Sinquefield Cup as part of the Grand Chess Tour 2022. He won his first game against Nepomniachtchi, the Candidates Tournament 2022 winner. He subsequently drew his second game to Levon Aronian, leaving him in tied first place with American wildcard Hans Niemann. In the third game, Carlsen was defeated by Niemann, ending his 53-game unbeaten streak in classical chess that chess24 described as a \"stunning victory\".[253][254] Carlsen soon after announced his withdrawal in a tweet with a video of Portuguese football manager José Mourinho saying, \"I prefer really not to speak. If I speak, I am in big trouble.\"[255][256] The New York Times stated that \"online observers interpreted Mr. Carlsen's post as insinuating that Mr. Niemann cheated in some way during the game\", though no concrete evidence of cheating had been found.[257] Carlsen's previous results still affect his FIDE rating; however, they will be removed from the tournament standing.[256] This was the first time in Carlsen's career to withdraw from a major event in progress, and was considered \"virtually unprecedented\" in top level chess.[256] Two weeks later, Carlsen faced Niemann in the Julius Baer Generation Cup, a section of the Champions Chess Tour 2022, an online chess tour. Carlsen, playing as black, resigned after one move, continuing the scandal.[258] On 26 September, Carlsen finally broke his silence and accused Niemann of cheating.[259] Subsequently, on 20 October Niemann filed a lawsuit against Carlsen and four other defendants, alleging five counts of action, including libel and slander.[260][261] The case was dismissed in June 2023, with the judge ruling that the claim of defamation was outside her federal jurisdiction.[262] In December 2023, the FIDE Ethics & Disciplinary Commission fined Carlsen €10,000 for his withdrawal from the tournament.[263][264] In January, Carlsen participated in the Tata Steel Chess Tournament. He lost consecutive games, which had not happened since 2015, first to Anish Giri and then to the young Uzbek prodigy Nodirbek Abdusattorov.[265] He recovered and finished 3rd, with the same score as Abdusattorov, but behind Giri, who won the tournament.[266] In February, Carlsen participated in the Airthings Masters 2023 which he won by defeating the American Grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura in the finals. Having earlier declined to defend his World Championship title, Carlsen ceased to be World Champion at the completion of the title match between Ding Liren and Ian Nepomniachtchi (the World Chess Championship 2023), won by Ding. In an interview after the match, Carlsen said he was \"suffering from a lack of motivation to play classical chess, because of the dominance of opening preparation\".[267] Subsequently, he did not enter the cycle for the World Chess Championship 2024. Carlsen competed in the Norway Chess tournament, and performed poorly with a score of 11½/27, drawing 8 classical games, losing 1, and winning 0. He managed to win 7/8 Armageddon blitz games (after a drawn classical game). Carlsen competed in two Grand Chess Tour events as wild cards, winning both, the Poland Rapid & Blitz and Croatia Rapid & Blitz. In the 2023 Chess World Cup, Carlsen reached the finals by defeating 65th seed Aryan Tari in the third round, 32nd seed Vincent Keymer in the fourth round, Vasyl Ivanchuk in the fifth round, Gukesh D in the quarterfinals, and Nijat Abasov in the semi-finals. Carlsen was sickened by food poisoning during the tournament.[268] In the finals against R Praggnanandhaa, Carlsen won during the tiebreaks, making it his first time winning a World Cup.[268][269] He defeated Alireza Firouzja in the final of the 2023 Julius Baer Generation Cup to clinch his third tournament victory on the 2023 Champions Chess Tour.[270] Carlsen won his third Speed Chess Championship, beating five-time defending champion Hikaru Nakamura in the final to deny him a sixth consecutive title.[271] Carlsen beat Wesley So in the 2023 Champions Chess Tour finals to win the Champions Chess Tour for a third consecutive year.[272] Carlsen won the World Rapid Chess Championship 2023 with a score of 10/13 (+7-0=6). He won his 5th World Rapid Chess Championship title. He also won the World Blitz Chess Championship 2023 with a score of 16/21 (+12-1=8). He won his 7th World Blitz Chess Championship title. He became the first man to successfully defend both the rapid and blitz titles simultaneously in the world championships.[273] In February, Carlsen participated in the Champions Chess Tour Chessable Masters competition, where he won the grand finale for a $30,000 prize.[274][275] In February, Carlsen organized and played in the Freestyle Chess G.O.A.T. Challenge, which was an over-the-board Fischer random chess tournament which included some of the top players in the world. He placed fifth in the round-robin rapid portion of the tournament, which determined the pairings for the main event, which was played under classical time controls. He won the main event, beating Fabiano Caruana in the final for a $60,000 prize.[276] It was the first ever classical Fischer random chess super-tournament.[277] In September, Carlsen won his fourth Speed Chess Championship title, defeating GM Alireza Firouzja in the finals held in Paris, France. Carlsen displayed a dominant performance, finishing with a score of 23.5-7.5, winning 21 games, drawing 5, and losing only 5 in the four-hour match. Carlsen and GM Hikaru Nakamura remain the only players to have won the tournament since its inception in 2016.[278] Also in September, Carlsen played in the 45th Chess Olympiad for Team Norway, and they placed 14th out of 188 countries. Carlsen finished with a score of 6/8, conceding draws to Mustafa Yilmaz, and Parham Maghsoodloo, while only losing to Vladimir Fedoseev. A notable win was against Vietnam GM Liem Le.[279] To finish September, Carlsen also took home the 2024 Julius Baer Generation Cup, by going undefeated and beating Alireza Firouzja 2.5-1.5 in the Grand Final.[280] On 21 December, Carlsen defeated Ian Nepomniachtchi in the finals of Champions Chess Tour 2024, winning the tournament for a fifth consecutive time.[281][282] On 27 December, following round six of the World Rapid Chess Championship, Carlsen was warned and fined for wearing jeans. He refused to change his jeans, causing him to not be paired for round nine. He proceeded to withdraw himself from both the Rapid and the Blitz tournaments.[283][284][285] TPR (Tournament Performance ratings) of FIDE-rated events calculated according to FIDE.[286] Carlsen won the Chess Oscars from 2009 to 2013. The Chess Oscar, organised by the Russian chess magazine 64, was awarded to the year's best player according to a worldwide poll of leading chess critics, writers, and journalists, but it was no longer awarded after 2013, as 64 ceased publication.[466][467] The Norwegian tabloid Verdens Gang (VG) has awarded Carlsen the \"Name of the Year\" (Årets navn) twice, in 2009[468] and 2013.[469] VG also named him \"Sportsman of the Year\" in 2009.[470] Carlsen has also won the Folkets Idrettspris, a people's choice award from the Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet, in 2009[471] and 2010.[472] In 2011, he was awarded the Peer Gynt Prize, a Norwegian prize awarded annually to \"a person or institution that has achieved distinction in society\".[473] In 2013, Time magazine named Carlsen one of the 100 most influential people in the world.[474] In the January 2006 FIDE rankings, at the age of 15 years and 32 days, Carlsen attained a 2625 Elo rating, which made him the youngest person to surpass 2600[475] (the record has since been broken by Wesley So, Wei Yi, John M. Burke, and Yağız Kaan Erdoğmuş[476]). In the July 2007 FIDE rankings, at the age of 16 years and 213 days, Carlsen attained a 2710 Elo rating, which made him the youngest person to surpass 2700 (the record has since been broken by Wei Yi).[477] On 5 September 2008, after winning in round 4 of the Bilbao Masters, Carlsen, aged 17 years and 280 days old, briefly became No. 1 on the unofficial live ratings list.[478][479] Carlsen's victory in the 2009 Nanjing Pearl tournament raised his FIDE rating to 2801, making him, aged 18 years and 336 days, at the time the youngest player ever to surpass 2800[87] (a record subsequently broken by Alireza Firouzja).[480] The youngest before Carlsen to achieve this feat was Vladimir Kramnik at the age of 25,[481] and up until this point only Kasparov, Topalov, Kramnik, and Anand had achieved a 2800+ rating.[482] The FIDE rankings in January 2010 recorded Carlsen's rating at 2810, which made him No. 1 rated player in the world.[483] This meant that Carlsen became, at the age of 19 years and 32 days, the youngest ever world No. 1, as well as the first player from a Western nation to reach the top of the FIDE rankings since Bobby Fischer in 1971.[484][485][486] The March 2010 FIDE rankings showed Carlsen with a new peak rating of 2813, a figure that only Kasparov had bettered at that time.[101] On the January 2013 FIDE rankings, Carlsen reached 2861, thus surpassing Garry Kasparov's 2851 record from July 1999.[134][135] In the May 2014 rankings, Carlsen achieved an all-time high record of 2882,[487] with a peak of 2889 on the live ratings list achieved on 21 April 2014.[488] In August 2019 he equalled his peak FIDE rating of 2882.[489] As of December 2024,[update] Carlsen is also ranked No. 1 in the FIDE rapid rating list with a rating of 2838, and No. 1 in the FIDE blitz rating list with a rating of 2890.[490] Carlsen had an aggressive style of play as a youth,[491][492] and, according to Simen Agdestein, his play was characterised by \"a fearless readiness to offer material for activity\".[493] As he matured, Carlsen found that this risky playing style was not as well suited against the elite of the chess world. When he started playing in top tournaments, he had trouble getting much out of the opening. To progress, Carlsen's style became more universal, capable of handling all sorts of positions well. He opens with both 1.d4 and 1.e4, as well as 1.c4, and, on occasion, 1.Nf3, thus making it harder for opponents to prepare against him and reducing the effect of computer analysis.[494][495][496] He said in 2015 that the middlegame is his favourite part of the game as it comes down to \"pure chess\".[494] In a 2016 interview, Anish Giri said: \"Magnus and I are very close in terms of style, but in our approach to the game we're total opposites. Magnus tries to put the accent only on play, getting away from preparation, but for me preparation plays an enormous role.\"[497] [Carlsen] has been known to say that he isn't all that interested in opening preparation; his main forte is the middlegame, in which he manages to outplay many of his opponents with positional means. ... Carlsen's repertoire is aimed at avoiding an early crisis in the game. He invariably aims for middlegames that lend themselves to a strategic approach. Garry Kasparov, who coached Carlsen from 2009 to 2010, said that Carlsen has a positional style similar to that of past world champions such as Anatoly Karpov, José Raúl Capablanca, and Vasily Smyslov, rather than the tactical style of Alexander Alekhine, Mikhail Tal, and Kasparov himself.[499] In a 2013 interview, Peter Heine Nielsen said: \"The days of big novelties are over, and that fits Magnus' style well.\"[500] According to Carlsen, however, he does not have any preferences in playing style.[501] Kasparov said in 2013 that \"Carlsen is a combination of Karpov [and] Fischer. He gets his positions [and] then never lets go of that bulldog bite. Exhausting for opponents.\"[502][non-primary source needed] Carlsen has also stated that he follows in the traditions of Karpov and Fischer, but additionally mentions Reuben Fine as a player who \"was doing in chess similar to what I am doing\".[503] Anand said of Carlsen in 2012: \"Magnus has an incredible innate sense. ... The majority of ideas occur to him absolutely naturally. He's also very flexible, he knows all the structures and he can play almost any position.\" He also compared Carlsen to Boris Spassky in his prime, and stated that \"Magnus can literally do almost everything.\"[504] Kasparov expressed similar sentiments: \"[Carlsen] has the ability to correctly evaluate any position, which only Karpov could boast of before him.\"[505] When asked in a 2016 interview whether Carlsen's style resembles his own, Karpov answered: \"It is quite possible. He grew up when I was in power, and perhaps he studied my games. He can convert a minimal advantage into a real one.\"[506] In a 2012 interview, Vladimir Kramnik stated that Carlsen's \"excellent physical shape\" was a contributing factor to his success against other top players as it prevents \"psychological lapses\", which enables him to maintain a high standard of play over long games and at the end of tournaments, when the energy levels of others have dropped.[507] Levon Aronian said in 2015: \"Magnus' main secret is his composure and the absence of any soul-searching after mistakes during a game.\"[508] Tyler Cowen gave a point of view on Carlsen's playing style: \"Carlsen is demonstrating one of his most feared qualities, namely his 'nettlesomeness,' to use a term coined for this purpose by Ken Regan, of the University at Buffalo.[509] Using computer analysis, you can measure which players do the most to cause their opponents to make mistakes. Carlsen has the highest nettlesomeness score by this metric, because his creative moves pressure the other player and open up a lot of room for mistakes. In contrast, a player such as Kramnik plays a high percentage of very accurate moves, and of course he is very strong, but those moves are in some way calmer and they are less likely to induce mistakes in response.\"[510] Carlsen's endgame prowess has been singled out for praise.[511][512][513] Jon Speelman, analysing several of Carlsen's endgames from the 2012 London Classic (in particular, his wins against McShane, Aronian, and Adams), described what he calls the \"Carlsen effect\": ... through the combined force of his skill and no less important his reputation, he drives his opponents into errors. ... He plays on for ever, calmly, methodically and, perhaps most importantly of all, without fear: calculating superbly, with very few outright mistakes and a good proportion of the \"very best\" moves. This makes him a monster and makes many opponents wilt.[514] An artificial intelligence approach, designed by Jean-Marc Alliot of the Institut de recherche en informatique de Toulouse (\"Toulouse Computer Science Research Institute\"), which compares chess grandmaster moves against that of Stockfish—a chess engine that outperforms all human opponents—rated Carlsen as the best player of all time as he had the highest probability among all World Chess Champions to play the moves that Stockfish suggested.[515] Carlsen also plays speed chess online under many screen names. He is known for meme openings such as the Bongcloud Attack and exceptionally strong play, despite banter and gags.[516] Carlsen modelled for G-Star Raw's Fall/Winter 2010 advertising campaign along with American actress Liv Tyler. The campaign was shot by Dutch film director and photographer Anton Corbijn.[522] The campaign was coordinated with the RAW World Chess Challenge in New York, an event in which Carlsen played an online team of global chess players, who voted on moves suggested by Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, Hikaru Nakamura and Judit Polgár. Carlsen, playing white, won in 43 moves.[523] In February 2014, he appeared in G-Star Raw's Spring/Summer 2014 campaign along with actress and model Lily Cole.[524] Film director J. J. Abrams offered Carlsen a role in the movie Star Trek Into Darkness as \"a chess player from the future\", but Carlsen was unable to get a work permit in time for shooting.[525] In 2012, Carlsen was featured in a 60 Minutes segment[526] and appeared as a guest on The Colbert Report.[527] He was also interviewed by Rainn Wilson for SoulPancake in 2013.[528] As of 2012[update], Carlsen is the only active chess professional with a full-time manager; Espen Agdestein, a FIDE Master and brother of Carlsen's former trainer Simen Agdestein, began working as an agent for Carlsen in late 2008.[529] Agdestein's work consisted initially of finding sponsors and negotiating media contacts but, since 2011, he has taken over management tasks formerly performed by Carlsen's father Henrik.[530] According to The New York Times, Carlsen earned US$1.2 million in 2012, the bulk of which was from sponsorships.[531] In August 2013, Carlsen became an ambassador for Nordic Semiconductor,[532] and in November was selected as one of the \"sexiest men of 2013\" by Cosmopolitan.[533] In 2017, Carlsen made a special guest appearance on The Simpsons in an episode where Homer's chess history is revealed.[534] In 2020, Carlsen announced that he had signed a two-year sponsorship deal with gambling company Unibet to act as a \"global ambassador\".[535] Unibet parent company Kindred Group is also a sponsor of Offerspill Chess Club. Offerspill was founded by Carlsen in 2019 after the Norwegian Chess Federation turned down Kindred's sponsorship offer. It is now Norway's largest chess club; Carlsen is its current chairman.[536] In April 2022, the Kindred Group (through Unibet) extended its partnership with Carlsen for another two years, and also extended its sponsorship of Offerspill.[537] In October 2013, Carlsen co-founded a company, Play Magnus AS, with Espen Agdestein and Anders Brandt.[538] Based in Oslo, Norway, Play Magnus' first product was an iOS app, called Play Magnus, that allows the user to play a chess engine created using a database of thousands of Carlsen's recorded games from the age of five and up. Carlsen stated he wished for the app to encourage more people to play chess.[539][540] In March 2019, Play Magnus AS merged with chess24.com, consolidating into the Play Magnus Group.[541] On 8 October 2020, Play Magnus Group was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. Magnus Chess, an entity controlled by Carlsen and his family, then owned 9.5% of Play Magnus Group.[542] In August 2022, Chess.com finalised an offer of acquisition for Play Magnus Group, which officially closed on 16 December 2022. As part of the acquisition, Carlsen signed as a brand ambassador for Chess.com.[543][544][545] As of 2016, Carlsen identifies as a social democrat and mostly follows a vegetarian diet; two of his sisters are vegetarians.[546] Carlsen is an avid fan of association football, with Real Madrid CF as his favourite club. In recognition of becoming world chess champion, he took the honorary kick-off in a La Liga game between Real Madrid and Real Valladolid on 30 November 2013.[547] Carlsen also follows the Premier League and plays fantasy football. In December 2019, he reached the No. 1 spot on a Fantasy Premier League game, ahead of seven million other players, before eventually finishing the season in 10th place.[548][549]",

                "content": "Magnus Carlsen (born Sven Magnus Øen Carlsen, 30 November 1990) was the World Chess Champion (2013-2023). He became World Champion on 22 November 2013, by defeating Viswanathan Anand by 6½ to 3½.[1] Carlsen also won the return match in 2014 by 6½–4½. He also won the match against Sergey Karjakin in 2016, against Fabiano Caruana in 2018, and against Ian Nepomniachtchi in 2021. A Norwegian chess grandmaster and chess prodigy, Carlsen is the highest rated player in the world,[2] and the highest rated player in the history of chess.[3][4] His peak rating of 2882 is higher than even Kasparov achieved. Kasparov's highest rating was 2851.[5] On 26 April 2004, Carlsen became a grandmaster at the age of 13 years, 148 days. This made him the third-youngest grandmaster in history. He played at the Nanjing Pearl Spring tournament in September–October 2009. This lifted him to an Elo rating of 2801. This made him second in the world. He is the fifth player to have a rating over 2800. He was 18 years old when he got this rating. This made him the youngest person to have a rating above 2800. On 1 January 2010, the new FIDE rating list was published. He was 19 years and 32 days old when he became the youngest chess player in history to be ranked world number one. He broke the previous record held by Vladimir Kramnik.[6][7] In London, March 2013, Carlsen won the 2013 Candidates tournament and qualified to challenge Anand for the World Chess Championship. Carlsen has won the World Championship matches in 2014, 2016, 2018 and 2021. In 2023, Magnus announced, that he would not take part in World chess Championship 2023. Ding Liren won. The coming of chess databases and strong chess-playing engines makes it difficult to compare his achievements with previous world champions. However, he is thought to be one of the best.[8] In 2024, he won a set of matches against Hans Niemann.[9] A lawsuit against Carlsen, was rejected (2023) by the U.S. federal court system. Hans Niemann was the plaintiff.[10] When Carlsen became the fourth-best player in the world he reached an agreement with a public relations (PR) expert in early 2009. This arrangement has borne fruit. Carlsen now has two sponsors, each of which provides 100,000 Euros a year. One is a stockbroker, the other a law firm. With this money, Carlsen is able to travel, and spend time on training. His coach is Garry Kasparov, a former World chess champion.[11] In return for the sponsorship, Carlsen wears the names of the sponsors on his jackets. This is called 'logo exposure'. He attends meetings, and gives talks. His image helps the companies to hire 'high achievers' to their staff. Put simply, companies of that type are keen to hire intelligent people. Carlsen's overall business manager is his father, Henrik.[11] Norway held the 2014 Chess Olympiad, and the Norwegian Government gave 70 million kroner (~8.5 million euros) in support of the event.[11]",

                "content": "J'Kaylin Dobbins (born December 17, 1998) is an American professional football running back for the Los Angeles Chargers of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Ohio State Buckeyes and was selected by the Baltimore Ravens with the 55th pick in the second round of the 2020 NFL draft. He spent four seasons with the Ravens before joining the Chargers. Dobbins attended La Grange High School in La Grange, Texas. During his high school football career, he had 5,149 yards and 74 touchdowns.[1] He rushed for 2,243 yards and 37 touchdowns as a sophomore and 2,740 yards and 35 touchdowns as a junior.[2] He played in only one game his senior year due to an injury.[3] Despite his injury, Dobbins was a highly-touted four-star prospect, and received over twenty scholarship offers from Power Five conferences. All major recruiting websites ranked him in the top five among his 2017 class for his position and in the top ten for players from the state of Texas. 247Sports and ESPN.com ranked him as a top-50 recruit in the country.[note 1] After some speculation that he would sign with Texas or Oklahoma, Dobbins committed to Ohio State University to play college football.[4] Sources: In his first game at Ohio State in 2017, Dobbins rushed for 181 yards on 29 carries against Indiana.[5][6] Dobbins had earned the start over the returning 2016 Big Ten Freshman of the Year Mike Weber who was recovering from an injury. In his first season, he eclipsed 100 rushing yards in six games and became only the fourth freshman in Ohio State history to eclipse the 1,000-yard rushing mark in a season. During the 2017 Big Ten Football Championship Game, Dobbins overtook Maurice Clarett for the most rushing yards by a Freshman with his 174-yard, MVP performance. During a 24–7 Cotton Bowl Classic win against USC, Dobbins set the Freshman rushing record at 1,403 yards.[7] Despite a record-setting 2017 season, Dobbins' would once again split time with Weber during his Sophomore year. The time split paired with Dwayne Haskins' award-winning performance at quarterback led to a decrease in productivity for Dobbins. He ended the season with 1,053 yards rushing but remained the team's leading rusher.[8] Notably, he had his first 200+ yard rushing game against Maryland.[9] In 2019, Dobbins would enter his junior season with high expectations. These expectations were met when he went on to gain 100+ yards in ten games during the season.[10] This included a four-touchdown performance against Michigan that stemmed from 211 yards rushing.[11] He finished his season as the only Buckeye in history to rush for more than 2,000 yards in a season, passing Eddie George. Dobbins was a Doak Walker Award finalist and finished sixth for the Heisman Trophy.[12] He was named First-team All-Big Ten and First-team All-American as an All-Purpose player by the Football Writers Association of America.[13] On December 30, 2019, Dobbins announced his intention to forgo his senior season and enter the 2020 NFL draft.[14] He left Ohio State with a total of 4,459 yards rushing, which makes him second all time. He won four Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week Awards, three Big Ten titles and two bowl games. Dobbins was selected in the second round of the 2020 NFL draft with the 55th overall pick by the Baltimore Ravens.[16] The Ravens previously traded tight end Hayden Hurst to the Atlanta Falcons to acquire the pick used on Dobbins. In his NFL debut against the Cleveland Browns on September 13, 2020, Dobbins had seven carries for 22 yards and scored his first two career rushing touchdowns in a 38–6 victory in Week 1.[17] In Week 8 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, he had his first 100-yard rushing game with 15 carries for 113 rushing yards in the 24–28 loss.[18] He was placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list by the team on November 23, 2020,[19] and activated on December 4.[20] Dobbins first start in his career came in a Week 16 27–13 win over the New York Giants. He finished the game with 11 carries for 77 yards and a touchdown.[21] In Week 17 against the Cincinnati Bengals, Dobbins rushed for 160 yards and 2 touchdowns during the 38–3 win.[22] Dobbins suffered a torn ACL in the final preseason game against the Washington Football Team on August 28, 2021, and was placed on injured reserve a few days later.[23][24] Dobbins did not play the entire 2021 season and was put into rehab during his time off.[25] Dobbins was cleared for full-time starter duty after missing the first two weeks of the season. However, he suffered another knee injury in Week 6 and was placed on injured reserve on October 22, 2022.[26] He was activated from injured reserve on December 10, 2022.[27] In Week 14 against the Steelers, he had 15 carries for 120 yards and a touchdown in the 16–14 win.[28] In Week 15 against the Browns, he had 13 carries for 125 yards in the 13–3 loss.[29] In the 2022 season, Dobbins appeared in and started eight games. He finished with 92 carries for 520 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns.[30] In the Wild Card Round loss to the Bengals, he had 105 scrimmage yards and a receiving touchdown.[31] In the Week 1 game against the Houston Texans, Dobbins finished with 22 rushing yards and a touchdown before leaving the game with an injury. Immediately thereafter, it was revealed that Dobbins had suffered a torn Achilles tendon, which prematurely ended his season.[32] He was placed on injured reserve on September 12, 2023.[33] On April 18, 2024, Dobbins signed a one-year contract with the Los Angeles Chargers.[34] In their 2024 season opener under new head coach Jim Harbaugh, he rushed 10 times for 135 yards and a touchdown in a 22–10 win over the Las Vegas Raiders.[35] In Week 2, he rushed for 131 yards and a touchdown in the 26–3 win over the Carolina Panthers.[36] In Week 12, Dobbins suffered a MCL sprain during the matchup against Baltimore Ravens, he was placed on injured reserve on November 30, ahead of the Week 13 matchup against Atlanta Falcons.[37] He was activated on December 27.",

                "title": "How J.K. Dobbins' Injury Affects the Chargers Running Backs",
                "content": "Editorial Director Chargers Head Coach Jim Harbaugh said Wednesday that J.K. Dobbins is \"working through something with his knee\" and that he expects the running back to \"miss some time.\" Dobbins did not practice on Wednesday as the Bolts began preparing for Sunday's road game in Atlanta. The running back had nine touches for 69 yards (7.6 yards per touch) Monday night before injuring his knee late in the first half against the Ravens. Dobbins did not return to the game. Dobbins' teammates on Wednesday expressed frustration for the 25-year-old who has dealt with multiple injuries already in his career. \"We feel horrible for him,\" Justin Herbert said. \"He's such a tough teammate and the way he's fought through so many injuries, we have no doubt he's going to be back better than ever.\" Hassan Haskins added: \"I was definitely kind of bummed out that happened to him. He's been having one hell of a year. I know how he's feeling and what all he's been through, but he's going to bounce back.\" Dobbins had played in all 11 games thus far and is on pace for a career year. He currently leads the Chargers in rushing attempts (158), yards (766), rushing touchdowns (eight) and runs for a first down (39). Dobbins is less than 40 yards from setting his career best and is also on pace for the first 1,000-yard season of his career. If Dobbins misses extended time, the Chargers will rely on a trio of running backs in Gus Edwards, Haskins and rookie Kimani Vidal. \"Like them a lot,\" Harbaugh said. \"Gus is heating back up, great to have him back in there. \"Hassan is really playing spectacular football. Special teams, he's playing really good. Pass protection, he's had some crucial first down pickups for us in short yardage,\" Harbaugh added. \"And Kimani, excited to see him out there as well.\" Herbert ranks second on the team with 211 rushing yards, followed by 206 from Edwards, who spent time on Injured Reserve earlier this season. Haskins played a season-high 31 snaps Monday night but didn't have a carry, meaning he spent a lot of time in pass protection. \"I pride myself anytime I go into the game,\" Haskins said Wednesday. \"I'm trying to help the team win, so anything they need me to do, I'm going to do it to my best.\" He later added: \"I'm just ready whenever they need me.\" Vidal's best moment this season came on his first NFL touch, which was a 38-yard touchdown catch in Week 6 against Denver. The Chargers currently rank 13th in rushing yards per game (118.1) and are 15th in rushing EPA per play (-0.073). Herbert said Wednesday it will take a collective effort to make up for Dobbins' absence. \"It's up to us, it's our responsibility to hold it down while he's gone,\" Herbert said. \"We know how much he cares about this team, about our success, about our performances. \"We got to do a good job of making right by him and making him proud,\" Herbert added. The Chargers are currently 9-6 and in the No. 6 spot in the AFC playoff picture Here are the Chargers inactive players for Week 17 against the Patriots Antonio Gates, one of the best tight ends in NFL history, is a finalist for the 2025 Pro Football Hall of Fame Class The Los Angeles Chargers today activated running back J.K.

                "title": "Greg Gumbel - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Greg Gumbel (May 3, 1946 – December 27, 2024) was an American television sportscaster. He was best known for his various assignments for CBS Sports (most notably, the National Football League and NCAA basketball). He became the first African-American announcer to call play-by-play of a major sports championship in the United States when he announced Super Bowl XXXV for the CBS network in 2001. Until 2023, Gumbel was the studio host for CBS' men's college basketball coverage and was a play-by-play broadcaster for the NFL on CBS. Gumbel was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, the first child of Rhea Alice (LeCesne) and Richard Dunbar Gumbel, a judge.[1] His surname originates with his great-great-grandfather, who was a German-Jewish emigrant from the village of Albisheim.[2] As a young man, Gumbel grew up on Chicago's South Side, where he was raised Catholic, attending and graduating from De La Salle Institute.[3] In 1967, Gumbel graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in English from Loras College,[4] where he also played on the baseball team. He had two sisters, Renee Gumbel-Farrahi and Rhonda Gumbel-Thomas, and a younger brother, Bryant Gumbel, who also pursued a network television broadcasting career.[5][6] In 1973, Greg's brother Bryant, then working as a television sportscaster at KNBC in Los Angeles, informed him that another NBC owned-and-operated station, WMAQ-TV in Chicago, was auditioning for a sports announcer. At the time, Greg was selling hospital supplies in Detroit. He ultimately got the job, returned to Chicago and worked at WMAQ-TV for seven years. The sportscaster he replaced, Dennis Swanson, went on to become president of ABC Sports.[citation needed] Prior to his rising to prominence at CBS, Gumbel worked for MSG, ESPN, and WFAN radio in New York City. At ESPN, he anchored the show SportsCenter and did play-by-play for early NBA games. On MSG, Gumbel served as a backup announcer for Marv Albert on New York Knicks broadcasts as well as providing coverage for college basketball. When MSG signed a huge contract to broadcast New York Yankees games in 1989, Gumbel served as host of the pregame and postgame shows. In addition to his MSG duties, he was the host of the first radio morning show on radio station WFAN. However, station management replaced him with WNBC Radio personality Don Imus once WFAN took over WNBC's AM 660 frequency.[7] Gumbel's CBS career began with part-time work as an NFL announcer in 1988. In 1989, Gumbel began announcing college basketball as well. He became host of The NFL Today (alongside Terry Bradshaw) for the 1990 to 1993 seasons.[8] He also anchored CBS' coverage of Major League Baseball, college football, and, in 1999, CBS' coverage for the Daytona 500 and Pepsi 400.[9] Besides his hosting duties, Gumbel provided play-by-play for the NBA (alongside Quinn Buckner), Major League Baseball including the 1993 American League Championship Series (alongside Jim Kaat), and College World Series baseball.[10] He was the prime time anchor for the 1994 Winter Olympic Games from Lillehammer, Norway,[11] and co-anchor for the weekday morning broadcasts of the 1992 Winter Olympics from Albertville, France.[12] Gumbel moved to NBC in 1994 following CBS' losses of the NFL and Major League Baseball broadcasting contracts (Gumbel's last on-air assignment for CBS was providing play-by-play for the College World Series[13]). While at NBC, Gumbel hosted NBC's coverage of the 1994 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. He also did play-by-play for the 1995 Major League Baseball National League Division Series and National League Championship Series (on both occasions, teaming with Joe Morgan), did play-by-play for The NBA on NBC, hosted NBC's daytime coverage of the 1996 Summer Olympics from Atlanta, Georgia, hosted the 1995 World Championships of Figure Skating, and served as the studio host for The NFL on NBC.[citation needed] Gumbel left NBC after the network broadcast of Super Bowl XXXII to return to CBS. His first major assignment was to serve as studio host for the network's coverage of college basketball, including the NCAA men's basketball tournament.[14] As CBS had just acquired the rights to NBC's previous NFL package, Gumbel joined the broadcast team as the lead announcer with fellow NBC alumnus Phil Simms as his color commentator. Gumbel was the lead announcer for the NFL on CBS between 1998 and 2003, calling Super Bowls XXXV[15] and XXXVIII.[16] For the 2004 NFL season, Gumbel traded positions with Jim Nantz as host of The NFL Today with Nantz taking over as lead announcer.[17] At the end of the 2005 NFL season, Gumbel was replaced as studio host of The NFL Today by James Brown.[18] Gumbel returned to the broadcast booth as the #2 play-by-play man, replacing Dick Enberg, alongside color man Dan Dierdorf until Dierdorf retired after the 2013–14 NFL season. Gumbel also worked alongside Trent Green in the #3 team from 2014 until 2019. He worked in a three-man booth with Green and Bruce Arians for the 2018 NFL season. Gumbel then traded spots with Kevin Harlan in 2020, teaming with Rich Gannon. Adam Archuleta became Gumbel's partner in the #4 slot the following year after CBS declined to renew Gannon's contract.[19] CBS Sports extended its contract with Gumbel on March 15, 2023, which allowed him to continue hosting college basketball while stepping back from NFL coverage.[20] However, Gumbel was absent from March Madness coverage in 2024 due to family health issues.[21] Gumbel resided in Davie, Florida.[22] He was married to wife Marcy, and they had a daughter, Michelle.[4][23] In 1999, Gumbel refused to attend a NASCAR banquet honoring Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, on the basis that he disagreed with Thomas' positions on political issues.[24] He regularly appeared on Howard Stern's radio show.[25] Along similar lines, Gumbel said of Rush Limbaugh, \"I find him someone whose words and opinions I can do without.\"[26] Gumbel died from cancer at home on December 27, 2024, at the age of 78.[22][4][27][28] Gumbel is one of a few sports announcers to work on pre-game, play-by-play, and radio Super Bowl broadcast teams. He hosted the television pre-game show for Super Bowl XXVI (CBS); Super Bowl XXX (NBC); Super Bowl XXXII (NBC); Super Bowl XLVII (CBS); and Super Bowl 50 (CBS); provided tv play-by-play for Super Bowl XXXV (CBS) and Super Bowl XXXVIII (CBS); hosted the radio pre-game show for Super Bowl XXV (CBS); Super Bowl XXVI (CBS); Super Bowl XXVII (CBS); and Super Bowl XXVIII (CBS).[4] During his tenure as the chief anchor of The NFL Today, he served alongside co-anchors Dan Marino, Shannon Sharpe, and Boomer Esiason. He was nicknamed \"Gumby\" by some of his colleagues.[29]",

Hallie Golden, Associated Press Hallie Golden, Associated Press Leave your feedback Greg Gumbel, a longtime CBS sportscaster who broke barriers during his career calling some of the biggest sporting events, has died from cancer, according to a statement from his family released by the network on Friday. He was 78. “He leaves behind a legacy of love, inspiration and dedication to over 50 extraordinary years in the sports broadcast industry; and his iconic voice will never be forgotten,” wife Marcy Gumbel and daughter Michelle Gumbel said in a statement. In March, Gumbel missed his first NCAA Tournament since 1997 due to what he said at the time were family health issues. Gumbel was the studio host for CBS since returning to the network from NBC in 1998. Gumbel signed an extension with CBS last year that allowed him to continue hosting college basketball while stepping back from NFL announcing duties. In 2001, he announced Super Bowl 35 for CBS, becoming the first Black announcer in the U.S. to call play-by-play of a major sports championship. READ MORE: Hall of Famer Rickey Henderson, baseball’s legendary ‘Man of Steal,’ dies at 65 David Berson, president and CEO of CBS Sports, described Gumbel as someone who broke barriers and set standards for others during his years as a voice for fans in sports, including in the NFL and March Madness. “A tremendous broadcaster and gifted storyteller, Greg led one of the most remarkable and groundbreaking sports broadcasting careers of all time,” Berson said. Gumbel had two stints at CBS, leaving the network for NBC when it lost football in 1994 and returning when it regained the contract in 1998. Sean McManus said of all the moves he made in his nearly 27 1/2 years leading CBS Sports, one of his proudest was bringing Gumbel back. “Not only did he elevate our NFL and NCAA coverage to a new level, but his kindness, generosity, sense of humor and unselfishness were second to none. When he was around, he made everyone from the researchers to the technicians to the executives feel like he was their best friend,” said McManus, who retired as CBS Sports chairman in April. “His love for his family was always the foundation of his life. There will never be another Greg Gumbel, and our industry and this world is a sadder place without him.” Gumbel hosted CBS’ coverage of the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics and called Major League Baseball games during its four-year run broadcasting the national pastime. In 1995, he hosted the world figure skating championships and the following year hosted NBC’s daytime coverage of the Atlanta Summer Olympics. But it was football and basketball where he was best known and made his biggest impact. Gumbel hosted CBS’ NFL studio show, “The NFL Today,” from 1990 to 1993 and again in 2004-05. Earlier this year, Gumbel recalled replacing Brent Musburger as host of “The NFL Today” in 1990, describing it as intimidating and daunting. “The fact that I got to sit in the same chair and do the same thing or try to do the same thing that he did was an incredible honor,” he said. Gumbel also called NFL games as the network’s lead play-by-play announcer from 1998 to 2003, including Super Bowl 35 and 38. He returned to the NFL booth in 2005, leaving that role after the 2022 season. “Like all who knew and loved him, I too am saddened by his death, yet also so very grateful to have known him in my life,” Clark Kellogg, a CBS Sports college basketball game and studio analyst, said in a statement. “What a gift to be touched by such a good man and partner.” Gumbel was the older brother of Bryant Gumbel, the host of NBC’s “Today” show and “Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel” on HBO. Bryant Gumbel received a lifetime achievement award at the Sports Emmys in 2003. Greg Gumbel grew up in Chicago and graduated from Loras College in Dubuque, Iowa, in 1967 with a degree in English. He had plans to become an English teacher, but after his brother got into sportscasting, he auditioned at WMAQ-TV, an NBC affiliate in Chicago in 1973, according to the book “You Are Looking Live!: How The NFL Today Revolutionized Sports Broadcasting.” He was soon offered a position as weekend sports anchor. “I’m kind of surprised I got the job. I certainly wasn’t anyone who was polished,” he said in the book. “By my own reckoning, it took me a good year to start to feel comfortable in front of a camera.” Gumbel also worked for ESPN and the Madison Square Garden network. James Brown, who currently hosts “The NFL Today,” described Gumbel on Friday as “Mr. Versatility and also very telegenic.” “It was my pleasure to call him a friend and one who could do anything that was given to him in the wake of an assignment,” he added. Gumbel won local Emmy Awards during his long career and was the recipient of the 2007 Pat Summerall Award for excellence in sports broadcasting. Outside of his broadcast career, he was affiliated with the March of Dimes for three decades, including as a member of its board of trustees. He also was a member of the Sports Council for St Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital for 16 years. Associated Press Reporter Mike Sisak and Sports Writer Joe Reedy contributed to this report.

                "content": "The USC Trojans football program represents the University of Southern California in the sport of American football. The Trojans compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Big Ten Conference (Big Ten). Formed in 1888, the program has over 860 wins and claims 11 national championships, including 7 from the major wire-service: AP Poll and/or Coaches Poll.[3] USC has had 13 undefeated seasons including 8 perfect seasons, and 37 conference championships. The Trojans have produced eight Heisman Trophy winners and 531 NFL draft picks, with the Heismans being the most all-time by a university, and NFL draft picks 1 behind Notre Dame's 532[4] USC alumni include 84 first-team Consensus All-Americans, including 27 unanimous selections, and 35 College Football Hall of Fame members, including former players Matt Leinart, O. J. Simpson, and Ronnie Lott and former coaches John McKay and Howard Jones. The Trojans boast 14 inductees in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, tied with Notre Dame for most of any school, including Junior Seau, Bruce Matthews, Marcus Allen, and Ron Yary.[5] Among all colleges and universities, as of 2022, USC holds the all-time record for the most quarterbacks (17) and is tied with the University of Miami for the most wide receivers (40) to play in the NFL.[6] The Trojans have 55 bowl appearances, 39 of which are among the New Year's Six Bowls. With a record of 35–20, USC has the second highest all-time post-season winning percentage of schools with 50 or more bowl appearances.[7] The Trojans play their home games in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, which is located in Exposition Park adjacent to USC's University Park, Los Angeles campus.[8][9] USC first fielded a football team in 1888. Playing its first game on November 14 of that year against the Alliance Athletic Club, USC achieved a 16–0 victory. Frank Suffel and Henry H. Goddard were playing coaches for the first team which was put together by quarterback Arthur Carroll, who in turn volunteered to make the pants for the team and later became a tailor.[10] USC faced its first collegiate opponent the following year in fall 1889, playing St. Vincent's College to a 40–0 victory.[10] In 1893, USC joined the Intercollegiate Football Association of Southern California (the forerunner of the SCIAC), which was composed of USC, Occidental College, Throop Polytechnic Institute (Cal Tech), and Chaffey College. Pomona College was invited to enter, but declined to do so. An invitation was also extended to Los Angeles High School.[11] Before they were named Trojans in 1912, USC athletic teams were called the Methodists (occasionally the \"Fighting Methodists\"), as well as the Wesleyans. During the early years, limitations in travel and the scarcity of major football-playing colleges on the West Coast limited its rivalries to local Southern Californian colleges and universities. During this period USC played regular series against Occidental, Caltech, Whittier, Pomona and Loyola. The first USC team to play outside of Southern California went to Stanford University on November 4, 1905, where they were trampled 16–0 by the traditional West Coast powerhouse. While the teams would not meet again until 1918 (Stanford dropped football for rugby union during the intervening years), this was also USC's first game against a future Pac-12 conference opponent and the beginning of its oldest rivalry. During this period USC also played its first games against other future Pac-12 rivals, including Oregon State (1914), California (1915), Oregon (1915), Arizona (1916) and Utah (1915-1917, 1919). Between 1911 and 1913, USC followed the example of California and Stanford and dropped football in favor of rugby union. The results were disastrous, as USC was soundly defeated by more experienced programs while the school itself experienced financial reverses; it was during this period that Owen R. Bird, a sportswriter for the Los Angeles Times, coined the nickname \"Trojans\", which he wrote was \"owing to the terrific handicaps under which the athletes, coaches and managers of the university were laboring and against the overwhelming odds of larger and better equipped rivals, the name 'Trojan' suitably fitted the players.\"[10] After several decades of competition, USC first achieved national prominence under head coach \"Gloomy\" Gus Henderson in the early 1920s. Another milestone came under Henderson in 1922, when USC joined the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC), the forerunner of the modern Pac-12. Success continued under coach Howard Jones from 1925 to 1940, when the Trojans were just one of a few nationally dominant teams. It was during this era that the team achieved renown as the \"Thundering Herd\", earning its first four national titles. USC achieved intermittent success in the years following Jones' tenure. Jeff Cravath, who coached from 1942 to 1950, won the Rose Bowl in 1943 and 1945. Jess Hill, who coached from 1951 to 1956, won the Rose Bowl in 1953. From 1957 to 1959, the Trojans were coached by Don Clark. Future Hall of Famer Ron Mix was an All American for the Trojans in 1959. The program entered a new golden age upon the arrival of head coach John McKay (1960–1975). During this period the Trojans produced two Heisman Trophy winners (Mike Garrett and O. J. Simpson) and won four national championships (1962, 1967, 1972 and 1974). McKay's influence continued even after he departed for the NFL when an assistant coach, John Robinson (1976–1982), took over as head coach. Under Robinson, USC won another national championship in 1978 (shared with Alabama; ironically, USC defeated Alabama, 24–14, that same season) and USC produced two more running-back Heisman Trophy winners in Charles White and Marcus Allen On September 12, 1970, USC opened the season visiting the University of Alabama under legendary coach Paul \"Bear\" Bryant and became the first fully integrated team to play in the state of Alabama.[12] The game, scheduled by Bryant, resulted in a dominating 42–21 win by the Trojans. More importantly, all six touchdowns scored by USC team were by black players, two by USC running back Sam \"Bam\" Cunningham, against an all-white Crimson Tide team.[13] After the game, Bryant was able to persuade the university to allow black players to play, hastening the racial integration of football at Alabama and in the Deep South.[12][14] In the 1980s, USC football did not realize a national championship, though it continued to experience relative success, with top-20 AP rankings and Pac-10 Conference championships under head coaches Ted Tollner (1983–1986) and Larry Smith (1987–1992) Each coach led the team to a win in the Rose Bowl and USC was recognized among the nation's top-ten teams three times. Despite the moderate success of team during these years, some alumni had grown accustomed to the program's stature as a perennial national championship contender. In 1993, Robinson was named head coach a second time, leading the Trojans to a victory in the 1996 Rose Bowl over Northwestern. It was during this time that the Trojans were unable to defeat their rivals. They suffered winless streaks of 13 years (1983–1995, including the 1994 17–17 tie) to rival Notre Dame and 8 years (1991–1998) to crosstown rival UCLA which were unacceptable to many USC supporters. Under Robinson the Trojans were 2–2–1 against Notre Dame, but unable to beat UCLA. After posting a 6–6 record in 1996, and a 6–5 record in 1997, Robinson was fired. In 1998, head coach Paul Hackett took over the team, but posted an even more disappointing 19–18 record in three seasons than any of his recent predecessors. By 2000, some observers surmised that USC football's days of national dominance were fading; the football team's record of 37–35 from 1996 to 2001 was their second-worst over any five-year span in history (only the mark of 29–29–2 from 1956 to 1961 was worse), and the period marked the first and only time USC had been out of the final top 20 teams for four straight years. In 2001, athletic director Mike Garrett released Hackett and hired Pete Carroll, a former NFL head coach. Carroll went 6–6 in his first year, losing to Utah in the Las Vegas Bowl, 10–6. After that, his teams became highly successful, ranking among the top ten teams in the country, with the exception of 2009 in which the team lost four regular season games. USC opened 3–2 in 2002, suffering losses to Kansas State and Washington State. However, the Trojans went on to win the rest of their games, completing the regular season 11–2 on the strength of senior quarterback Carson Palmer's breakout performance. After struggling for most of his collegiate career, Palmer excelled in the Pro Style offense installed by new offensive coordinator Norm Chow. In fact, Palmer's performance, particularly in the season-ending rivalry games against Notre Dame and UCLA, impressed so many pundits that he went on to win the Heisman Trophy, carrying every region of voting and becoming the first USC quarterback to be so honored. Despite tying for the Pac-10 title (with Washington State), having the highest BCS \"strength of schedule\" rating, and fielding the nation's top defense led by safety Troy Polamalu, USC finished the season ranked No. 5 in the BCS rankings. Facing off against BCS No. 3 Iowa in the Orange Bowl, USC defeated the Hawkeyes 38–17. In 2003, highly touted but unproven redshirt sophomore Matt Leinart took over the quarterback position from Palmer. Although his first pass went for a touchdown in a win over Auburn, the Trojans suffered an early season triple-overtime loss to their conference rival the California Golden Bears in Berkeley. After the Loss to California, USC went on a 10-game winning streak and finished the season with a record of 11–1. Before the postseason, both the coaches' poll and the AP Poll ranked USC number 1, but the BCS—which also gave consideration to computer rankings—ranked Oklahoma first, another one-loss team but one that had lost its own Big 12 Conference title game 35–7, with USC ranked third. In the 2003 BCS National Championship Game, the Sugar Bowl, BCS No. 2 LSU defeated BCS No. 1 Oklahoma 21–14. Meanwhile, BCS No. 3 USC defeated BCS No. 4 Michigan 28–14 in the Rose Bowl. USC finished the season ranked No. 1 in the AP poll and was awarded the AP National Championship; LSU, however, won the BCS National Championship title for that year, prompting a split national title between LSU and USC. In the wake of the controversy, corporate sponsors emerged who were willing to organize an LSU-USC game to settle the matter; nevertheless, the NCAA refused to permit the matchup. In 2004, USC was picked preseason No. 1 by the Associated Press, thanks to the return of Leinart as well as sophomore running backs LenDale White and Reggie Bush. The defense—led by All-American defensive tackles Shaun Cody and Mike Patterson, as well as All-American linebackers Lofa Tatupu and Matt Grootegoed—was considered to be among the finest in the nation. Key questions included the offensive line, with few returning starters, and the receiving corps, which had lost previous year's senior Keary Colbert and the breakout star of 2003, Mike Williams. Williams had tried to enter the NFL draft a year early during the Maurice Clarett trial when it was ruled that the NFL could not deny them entering the draft. The decision was appealed and overturned leaving Williams unable to enter the draft. When he applied to the NCAA for reinstatement of his eligibility, it was denied. Despite close calls against Stanford and California, the Trojans finished the regular season undefeated and headed for the 2004 BCS Championship Game at the Orange Bowl. USC was the second team in NCAA football history to have gone wire-to-wire (ranked first place from preseason to postseason since the AP began releasing preseason rankings); the first was Florida State in 1999 (two other schools went wire-to-wire before the existence of preseason polls - Notre Dame in 1943 and Army in 1945). Quarterback Leinart won the Heisman Trophy, with running back Bush placing fifth in the vote tally. The Trojans' opponent in the Orange Bowl, Oklahoma, were themselves undefeated and captained by sixth-year quarterback Jason White, who had won the Heisman in 2003; the game marked the first time in NCAA history that two players who had already won the Heisman played against each other. Most analysts expected the game to be close—as USC matched its speed and defense against the Oklahoma running game and skilled offensive line—but the reality proved to be far different. USC scored 38 points in the first half, and won the BCS National Championship Game by the score of 55–19, making them the BCS Champions and earning the team the AP National Championship as well. In June 2010, after a four-year investigation, the NCAA imposed sanctions against the Trojan football program for a \"lack of institutional control,\" including a public reprimand and censure, a two-year postseason ban, a loss of 30 scholarships over three years, and vacating all games in which Reggie Bush participated as an ineligible player (14 wins, 1 loss), including the 2005 Orange Bowl, in which the Trojans won the BCS National Championship.[15] These sanctions have been criticized by some NCAA football writers,[16][17][18][19][20] including ESPN's Ted Miller, who wrote, \"It's become an accepted fact among informed college football observers that the NCAA sanctions against USC were a travesty of justice, and the NCAA's refusal to revisit that travesty are a massive act of cowardice on the part of the organization.\"[21] Following the NCAA sanctions, BCS Executive Director Bill Hancock stated that a committee would decide whether to vacate USC's 2004 BCS Championship, but the final decision would be delayed until after the NCAA had heard USC's appeals against some of the sanctions.[22] On July 20, 2010, incoming USC president Max Nikias stated that the school would remove jerseys and murals displayed in Bush's honor from its facilities, and would return the school's copy of Bush's Heisman Trophy.[23] On September 14, Bush announced that he would forfeit the Heisman and return his copy of the trophy.[24] On May 26, 2011, the NCAA upheld all findings and penalties against USC. The team did not participate in the Pac-12 Football Championship Game or a bowl game during the 2011–12 season.[25] The BCS announced June 6, 2011, that it had stripped USC of the 2004 title,[26] but the Associated Press still recognizes USC as the 2004 AP National Champion.[27] The 2005 regular season witnessed a resuscitation of the rivalry with Notre Dame, after a last-second play in which senior quarterback Matt Leinart scored the winning touchdown with help from a controversial push from behind by running back Reggie Bush, nicknamed the \"Bush Push\". The year climaxed with a 66–19 USC defeat of cross-town rival UCLA. Running back Reggie Bush finished his stellar year by winning the Heisman Trophy (later returned by USC and reclaimed by the Heisman Trophy Trust considering Bush accepted improper benefits while at USC and was ineligible during the 2005 season),[24][28] while Leinart finished third in the Heisman voting. Several other players also earned accolades, being named All-Americans (AP, Football Coaches, Football Writers, Walter Camp, ESPN.com, SI.com, CBS Sportsline.com, Rivals.com, Collegefootballnews.com). These include QB Matt Leinart, RB Reggie Bush, RB LenDale White, S Darnell Bing, OT Taitusi Lutui, OT Sam Baker, WR Dwayne Jarrett, C Ryan Kalil, OG Fred Matua, and DE Lawrence Jackson. Additionally, OL Winston Justice did well enough to forgo his senior year and enter the NFL draft. The regular season ended with two clear-cut contenders facing off in the Rose Bowl to decide the national championship. Both USC and Texas were 12–0 entering the game; although USC was the slight favorite,[29] USC lost to Texas 41–38.[30] As with the 2004 season, later NCAA investigations into alleged improper benefits given to Reggie Bush altered the official record of the 2005 Trojan season. All twelve wins from the 2005 season were officially vacated. Reggie Bush would eventually manage to have his USC statistics and 2005 Heisman Trophy reinstated.[31] Despite this, anything which USC lost as a result of what the NCAA imposed against the team for the 2004 and 2005 seasons has still not been recovered, including a national title win.[32] For the 2006 football season, USC tried to rebuild its strength following the loss of offensive stalwarts Leinart, Bush, and White, defensive leader Bing, and offensive linemen Matua, Justice, and Lutui. The Trojans developed their offense using unproven QB John David Booty and returning star receivers Dwayne Jarrett and Steve Smith along with second-year wide-out Patrick Turner. Mark Sanchez, the highly touted QB of the recruiting class of 2005 (Mission Viejo High School) was widely viewed as a dark horse to win the starting job from Booty, although Booty was named the starter at the end of fall training camp. The starting tailback position was initially a battle between returning players Chauncey Washington and Desmond Reed (both recovering from injuries) and heralded recruits Stafon Johnson (Dorsey High School in Los Angeles), C.J. Gable, Allen Bradford and Emmanuel Moody. USC had many experienced players as well, including linebacker Dallas Sartz and wide receiver Chris McFoy, who had already graduated with their bachelor's degrees and were pursuing master's degrees. Fullback Brandon Hancock would have been part of that group as well until an injury ended his collegiate career. Additionally, fifth-year (redshirt) senior linebacker Oscar Lua, running back Ryan Powdrell and offensive lineman Kyle Williams were expected to either start or play frequently in 2006. The 2006 Trojans came out strong, easily defending their top 10 status throughout the year. As the season progressed, USC began to display marked inconsistencies, as their margins of victory began to slip. The first setback proved to be a 31–33 loss to unranked Oregon State, in which the Beavers were able to repeatedly capitalize on several Trojan turnovers.[33] Even though USC dropped initially in the polls, they worked their way back up. After defeating both Cal and Notre Dame, they held the number 2 spot heading into the final week of the season. The Trojans were considered to be a virtual lock for the BCS National Championship Game against Ohio State and just needed to beat UCLA. USC was shocked in the final game of the season, losing to crosstown rival UCLA 13–9. This eliminated the Trojans from championship contention and opened the door for Florida to become Ohio State's opponent. The Trojans did earn a Rose Bowl bid and defeated Michigan 32–18. It was the Trojans' fifth straight BCS Bowl appearance. On January 6, 2007, six days after the Rose Bowl Game, USC kicker Mario Danelo was found dead at the bottom of the White Point Cliff near Point Fermin Lighthouse in San Pedro, California.[34] In July 2007, ESPN.com named USC its No. 1 team of the decade for the period between 1996 and 2006, citing the Trojans' renaissance and dominance under Carroll.[35][36] The 2007 Trojans were the presumptive No. 1 pick before the season.[37][38] However, they lost two games, including a major upset to 41-point underdog Stanford, and they did not get into the national championship game. However, the Trojans did win their sixth conference championship and defeated Illinois in the 2008 Rose Bowl Game. Under Carroll, USC was known to attract numerous celebrities to its practices, including USC alumni Will Ferrell, George Lucas, LeVar Burton, and Sophia Bush as well as Snoop Dogg, Henry Winkler, Kirsten Dunst, Nick Lachey, Dr. Dre, Spike Lee, Alyssa Milano, Flea, Wilmer Valderrama, Jake Gyllenhaal and Andre 3000.[39] The Trojans benefited from Los Angeles's lack of NFL teams (with the Los Angeles Rams and Raiders having left in the early 1990s), combined with the Trojans' 21st century success, leading them to sometimes be called LA's \"de facto NFL team.\"[40] During Pete Carroll's first eight years as head coach, USC lost only one game by more than seven points, a 27–16 loss at Notre Dame in his first season, until the second half of the 2009 season. The early part of the 2000s also saw the rise of USC football's popularity in the Los Angeles market: without any stadium expansions, USC broke its average home attendance record four times in a row: reaching 77,804 in 2003, 85,229 in 2004, 90,812 in 2005 and over 91,416 with one game to go in 2006 (the capacity of the Coliseum is 92,000). As of 2022, USC is one of only two of the 131 Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly Division I-A) teams to have never played a Football Championship Subdivision (formerly Division I-AA) team since the split of Division I football in 1978.[41] After beating Penn State in the Rose Bowl, USC finished the season 12–1, and ranked No. 2 in the Coaches' Poll and No. 3 in the AP Poll. The 2008 season culminated in USC's seventh straight Pac-10 Championship, seventh straight BCS bowl appearance and seventh straight finish in the top 4 of the AP Poll. This also marked seven consecutive seasons where USC has not lost a game by more than 7 points. Their only loss was on the road against Oregon State, which was mentioned in the preseason as a possible upset.[42][43] After beating Boston College in the Emerald Bowl, USC finished the season 9–4, and ranked No. 20 in the Coaches' Poll and No. 22 in the AP Poll. USC ended its seven-year streak of Pac-10 Championship, BCS bowl appearance and top 4 finish of the AP Poll. The Trojans started the season strong beating No. 8 Ohio State at The Horseshoe. But they would lose to four Pac-10 teams (Washington, Oregon, Stanford, and Arizona). Blowout losses to Oregon 47–20 and Stanford 55–21 marked a turning point in USC's season and sparked debate in the media about the future dominance of USC football. After the season concluded, head coach Pete Carroll resigned to accept a head coaching position with the Seattle Seahawks. In 2009, USC was named \"Team of the Decade\" by both CBSSports.com and Football.com, as well as the \"Program of the Decade\" by SI.com, plus was No. 1 in CollegeFootballNews.com's \"5-Year Program Rankings\" and was ranked No. 2 in ESPN.com's \"Prestige Rankings\" among all schools since 1936 (behind Oklahoma).[44] Additionally, in 2009, ESPN.com ranked USC the second-best program in college football history. On January 12, 2010, Lane Kiffin was hired as the head coach. This came following Pete Carroll's departure from USC to become the head coach of the Seattle Seahawks.[45] In June 2010, after a prolonged four-year investigation into whether former USC running back Reggie Bush and his family had accepted financial benefits and housing from two sports agents in San Diego while he was a student athlete at USC, the NCAA imposed sanctions against the Trojan football program for a \"lack of institutional control,\" including a two-year postseason ban, the loss of 30 scholarships over three years, and the vacation of all wins in which Bush participated as an \"ineligible\" player, including the 2005 Orange Bowl, in which the Trojans won the BCS National Championship.[15] These sanctions have been criticized by many NCAA football writers,[16][17][18][19][20] including ESPN's Ted Miller, who wrote, \"It's become an accepted fact among informed college football observers that the NCAA sanctions against USC were a travesty of justice, and the NCAA's refusal to revisit that travesty are a massive act of cowardice on the part of the organization.\"[21] The 2010 team finished 8–5 (5–4 in the Pac-10) and was ineligible for post-season play. On February 9, 2010, Commissioner Larry Scott announced that the Pac-10 would be considering expanding to twelve schools.[46] The Pac-10 Conference officially became the Pac-12 Conference following the addition of Colorado and Utah on July 1, 2011. In 2011, although USC finished in first place in its conference division with a 7–2 record, due to their ineligibility to participate in a bowl game, the UCLA Bruins became champions of the inaugural Pac-12 South Division.[47] In the final regular-season game, USC's 50–0 win over UCLA was the largest margin of victory in the rivalry since 1930. The release of the December 4, 2011, final regular-season Associated Press college football poll marked USC's return to national prominence with the No. 5 ranking.[48] The Trojans were not eligible for postseason play and did not participate in any Bowl game. When the final AP Football Poll was released, USC dropped one spot to the No. 6 ranking. USC was ranked number one in The Associated Press' preseason college football poll for the seventh time in school history and the first time in five seasons, edging out No. 2 Alabama and No. 3 LSU.[49] However, the early season expectations would backfire as the Trojans would eventually finish 7–5 (5–4 versus Pac-12 opponents), including losses to all three of their major rivals (Notre Dame, UCLA, and Stanford) all in the same year for the first time since 1992. The team finished second in the Pac-12 South standings and unranked in any poll. The 2013 USC Trojans football team finished the season 10–4, 6–3 in Pac-12 play to finish in a tie for second place in the South Division. They were invited to the Las Vegas Bowl where they defeated Fresno State. Head coach Lane Kiffin, who was in his fourth year, was fired on September 29 after a 3–2 start to the season. He was replaced by interim head coach Ed Orgeron. At the end of the regular season, Washington head coach Steve Sarkisian was hired as the new head coach beginning in 2014. This prompted Orgeron to resign before the bowl game. Clay Helton led the Trojans in the Las Vegas Bowl. Steve Sarkisian, in his first year as head coach at USC, led the Trojans to a 9–4 season (6–3 in the Pac-12) to finish in a three-way tie for second place in the South Division. They were invited to the Holiday Bowl where they defeated Nebraska 45-42.[50] On September 8, 2014, Sarkisian and athletic director Pat Haden were reprimanded by Pac-12 Conference commissioner Larry Scott for attempting \"to influence the officiating, and ultimately the outcome of a contest\" during the game against Stanford two days earlier.[51] The 2015 season was a tumultuous one for the Trojans with a season record of 8–4 overall and 6–3 in Pac-12 play to finish as Pac-12 Southern Conference champions. Mid-season, coach Steve Sarkisian was fired to deal with personal issues, and Clay Helton was again named the interim head coach. ESPN later reported that Sarkisian came to a pre-practice meeting, appearing to be intoxicated. According to Scott Wolf, the USC beat writer for the Los Angeles Daily News, several players smelled alcohol on Sarkisian's breath.[52] The Trojans had lost to Stanford and Washington under Sarkisian. Under Helton, USC lost to Notre Dame, but then rallied to win the next four games. A loss to Oregon left the South Division conference championship to be decided by the USC-UCLA game; USC won 40–21. USC played in its first-ever Pac-12 Conference championship game, losing to Stanford (41–22) after the Cardinal (8-1 in Pac-12, 9-2 overall) locked up the North Division title, its third in four years, with its victory over California. USC went on to lose the 2015 Holiday Bowl 23–21 to the Wisconsin Badgers. Zach Banner started all 14 games at tackle, was First Team All-Pac-12, and won USC's Offensive Lineman of the Year Award after allowing only nine total pressures on 426 pass attempts, according to Pro Football Focus, which graded him as the season's top pass-blocking right tackle.[53][54][55] On December 7, Sarkisian filed a $30 million termination lawsuit against USC.[25] The 2016 USC Trojans football season marked Clay Helton's first full season as USC head coach. The team finished the season 10–3, (7–2 Pac-12), finishing as the runner-up of the South Division title and as Rose Bowl champions. After a 1–3 start during the month of September that featured losses to teams such as No. 1 Alabama, No. 7 Stanford, and No. 24 Utah, the Trojans began a nine-game winning streak to end their season. Some notable wins include victories over No. 21 Colorado, No. 4 Washington, and No. 5 Penn State in the Rose Bowl. Sam Darnold, a redshirt freshman quarterback, became the starter over Max Browne (1–2 record as starting QB) a few days before the Utah game. With that, the Trojans received much-needed stability after years of turmoil and coaching changes. The season was capped off with a dramatic 52–49 win in the Rose Bowl over Penn State, their first Rose Bowl victory in 8 years. USC finished No. 3 in the final AP polls for the season. Zach Banner, captain of the team, was again All-Pac-12 first-team, was CollegeSportsMadness.com All American first-team, Senior CLASS Award All-American first-team, Phil Steele All-Pac-12 first-team, a finalist for the Senior CLASS Award (given to the nation's top senior excelling in community/classroom/character/competition), and was the team's Co-Offensive Lineman of the Year.[54][56] Entering the season, the Trojans were ranked No. 4 in the AP Poll's preseason rankings. They finished the season 11–3, 8–1 in Pac-12, to be champions of the South Division. They represented the South Division in the Pac-12 Championship Game where they defeated Stanford to become Pac-12 Champions.[57] They were invited to play in the Cotton Bowl against Ohio State, but lost 24–7. In the final AP poll, they were ranked No. 12.[58] Notable players to depart to the NFL include Sam Darnold and Ronald Jones II.[59] Darnold is the 5th USC quarterback to be drafted in the first round of the NFL since 1967.[59] Though ranked No. 15 in the AP Poll's preseason rankings, the Trojans finished the season 5–7, (4–5 Pac-12), the program's first losing record since 2000 where they held the same record.[60] USC lost to both of its major rivals, UCLA and Notre Dame, in the same season for the first time since 2013, and it also lost to all other California Pac-12 schools (UCLA, California, and Stanford) in the same season for the first time since 1996.[60] They tied Arizona for third place in the Pac-12 South Division.[60] On November 25, USC athletic director Lynn Swann announced that head coach Clay Helton would return in 2019.[61] The Trojans finished the regular season 8–4, (7–2 Pac-12), holding second place in the Pac-12's South Division. USC was 2–3 against ranked teams. Following the regular season, they lost to the Iowa Hawkeyes in the Holiday Bowl 24–49.[62] On September 24, the conference announced that a six-game conference-only season would begin on November 6 with the conference's championship game to be played on December 18 after initially announcing in August that all fall sports competitions were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[63] Teams not selected for the championship game would be seeded to play a seventh game.[64] The Trojans finished the regular season with a 5–0 record, and qualified for the Pac-12 Championship Game, which they lost to Oregon 24–31. The following day, USC announced that it would not play in any bowl game, ending the season with an overall 5–1 record.[65] The Trojans were led by sixth-year head coach Clay Helton in the first two games. Helton was subsequently fired on September 13 following the team's 42–28 loss to Stanford.[66] Associate head coach Donte Williams took over as the team's interim head coach.[66] They finished the 2021 season with 4–8, their worst record since 1991 where they went 3–8.[67] They were not bowl eligible for the second time in 4 years (they were not bowl eligible the 2018 season after finishing with a 5-7 record). On November 28, 2021, Lincoln Riley was named the 30th head coach coming off of a five year stint at Oklahoma. First-year offensive coordinator Josh Henson and first-year defensive coordinator Alex Grinch[68] are both intended to coach alongside him for the season. As of February 28, USC's recruiting class was ranked 65th among NCAA D1 schools.[69] A notable incoming transfer is QB Caleb Williams, who reunites with Lincoln Riley from Oklahoma.[70] The Trojans went on to improve dramatically over their 2021 season, going from finishing 4-8, to 10-1, and being ranked #5 in the AP poll as of Week 12. During Lincoln Riley's inaugural season, the Trojans racked up wins against Rice 66-14, Stanford 41-28, Fresno State 45-17, Oregon State 17-14, Arizona State 42-25, and Washington State 30-14 before losing a close match to #20 ranked Utah 43-42. After this setback, the Trojans would bounce back and go on to beat Arizona 45-37, California 41-35, Colorado 55-17, and #16 ranked UCLA 48-45, clinching them a spot in the Pac-12 Championship. USC football started their last year in the Pac-12 ranked #6 in the pre-season AP Poll.[71] The team, under the coaching guidance of Lincoln Riley, and with the second year of on field leadership by quarterback Caleb Williams won four games (San Jose State, Nevada, Stanford, and Arizona State) by impressive margins with over 40 offensive points on the board resulting in a bump in the polls to #5.[72] USC won its next two games against Colorado and Arizona, scoring 40 offensive points. But the winning margins were squashed to only 7 and 2 points, respectively, with the Trojans' 43-41 3OT win against Arizona on October 7, 2023.[73] These close results dropped USC's ranking to #10.[74] USC lost five of its six next games, ending the season outside the top 25 with an overall record of 7-5 and a conference record of 5-4.[75] Entering the season Williams was the favorite to win the Heisman Trophy for the second year in a row, but after a disappointing second half of the season he was eliminated from contention leading into the December ceremony.[76] USC played the #16 Louisville Cardinals in the 2023 Holiday Bowl without Williams, who instead turned his focus to the NFL draft.[77] The Trojans ended up winning the game 42-28, with Miller Moss throwing a record 6 touchdown passes in the process.[78] USC has won 17 national championships from NCAA-designated major selectors.[79]: 112–115 USC claims 11 national championships,[80] including 7 from the major wire-service: AP Poll and/or Coaches' Poll. Two of USC's championships, 1928 and 1939, are based on the Dickinson System, a formula devised by a University of Illinois professor that awarded national championships between 1926 and 1940. The Dickinson System is cited in the Official 2010 NCAA FBS Record Book as a legitimate national title selector.[81] USC's claim is consistent with other FBS programs that won the Dickinson title. In 2004, USC recognized the 1939 squad as one of their national championship teams.[82][83][84] The 2004 team was forced to vacate the final two games of its season, including the 2005 Orange Bowl due to NCAA sanctions incurred as a result of loss of institutional control, and namely, in connection with Reggie Bush. USC appealed the sanctions, delaying consideration of vacating USC's 2004 championship by the BCS. Ultimately, USC lost the appeals and forfeited the 2004 BCS championship.[85] The AP did not vacate its 2004 championship, hence the Trojans retain a share of the national title.[85] ^Claimed national championships - USC claims the 1928, 1931, 1932, 1939, 1962, 1967, 1972, 1974, 1978, 2003, and 2004 championships.[80] † The FWAA stripped USC of its 2004 Grantland Rice Trophy and vacated the selection of its national champion for 2004. The BCS also vacated USC's participation in the 2005 Orange Bowl and USC's 2004 BCS National Championship, and the AFCA Coaches' Poll Trophy was returned.[88][89] In addition to the Orange Bowl victory over Oklahoma, the 2004 regular season finale win against UCLA was also vacated, making the official record of 2004 USC Trojans 11-0. USC has won 39 conference championships, all within the Pac-12 Conference or its predecessors. The 2004 and 2005 championships were vacated.[90] † Co-championship ^ Vacated due to NCAA penalty USC has won 4 division championships, all in the South division of the Pac-12.[90] † Co-championship USC has a bowl game record of 35–20 through the 2023 season.[93] The Trojans appeared in 34 Rose Bowls, winning 25, both records for the bowl. These are also the most times a team has appeared in or won any bowl game. USC was banned from entering a bowl during either the 2010 or 2011 seasons as part of the extremely extensive sanctions resulting from the University of Southern California athletics scandal. Below is the list of USC's ten most recent bowl appearances. USC head coaches from 1888 to present.[94] † Does not include 14 wins and 1 loss vacated due to NCAA penalty[94]In 2013, Kiffin was fired after first 5 games, Orgeron served as interim head coach for next 8 games before resigning and Helton was interim head coach for bowl game. In 2015, Sarkisian was fired after first 5 games and Helton was interim head coach for next 7 games before becoming permanent head coach. In 2021, Helton was fired after first 2 games and Williams will serve as interim head coach for next 10 games. USC is sometimes called \"Tailback U\" (Tailback University) because a number of running backs who played for the Trojans won the Heisman Trophy.[96] These running backs include Mike Garrett (1965), O. J. Simpson (1968), Charles White (1979), Marcus Allen (1981), and Reggie Bush (2005). \"Fight On\" is the fight song of the USC Trojans. The term \"Fight On\" is also used as a battle cry, often with the two finger \"V\" salute for Victory given in accompaniment.[97] The V gesture has its origins with the ancient Trojans, who would cut off the index and middle finger of soldiers they conquered so the conquered could no longer wield a sword in battle.[98] \"Tradition surrounds certain numbers at USC, most notably 55,\" wrote Gary Klein of the Los Angeles Times.[99] \"Junior Seau, Willie McGinest, Chris Claiborne and Keith Rivers,\" he added, \"are among the linebackers who have worn a number that Trojans coaches have been careful to distribute.\" Wrote Andy Kamenetzky of ESPN.com in an article titled \"Tradition of elite linebackers alive in 55,\" \"Membership, along with the hallowed No. 55 jersey, has been offered to a select few over the past few decades. Names such as Junior Seau. Keith Rivers. Willie McGinest. Chris Claiborne. Names forever etched in USC lore.\"[100] In the first 30 years of USC football, the school maintained rivalries with local Southern California schools like Occidental and Pomona, but these ended by the 1920s when USC joined the PCC and grew into a national caliber team.[101] A \"Perfect Day\" (a phrase created by the school's football announcer Pete Arbogast) to any USC fan is a USC win coupled with losses by UCLA and Notre Dame.[102] There have been 64 \"Perfect Days\" since the first one occurred in 1921. Perfect days have been possible since 1919, when UCLA began playing football. The most recent perfect day occurred on September 23, 2023, when USC defeated Arizona State, UCLA lost to Utah, and Notre Dame lost to Ohio State. USC has a rivalry with California.[103][104][105] While not as significant as the Stanford or UCLA rivalries, for either school, USC and Cal played an annual game, and met more than 100 times. The game was often called The Weekender, referring to the weekend trip to the Bay Area; although, this term also applied to the Stanford game, as each series (USC/Cal and USC/Stanford) would alternate home and away. As of the 2023 season, USC had played Cal more than any other opponent,[106] with the 2023 game marking the 112th meeting, according to Cal,[107] and the 108th meeting according to USC,[107] with discrepancies in the game record before 1920. The last Weekender was played on October 28, 2023, with Cal losing to USC 49-50.[108] USC's record in the series was 72-32-4, as of 2023.[107] In 2024, USC will join the Big Ten Conference[109][110] while Cal will join the Atlantic Coast Conference.[111][112] This will put the rivalry between the Bears and Trojans on hiatus with no future meetings scheduled as of March 2024.[113] USC plays Notre Dame each year, with the winner keeping the Jeweled Shillelagh. The inter-sectional game has featured more national championship teams, Heisman trophy winners, All-Americans, and future NFL hall-of-famers than any other collegiate match-up. The two schools have played the game annually since 1926 (except for years 1943–1945 when World War II travel restrictions kept the game from being played or 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic). Unlike most rivalry games, the game enjoys neither the possibility of acquiring regional \"bragging rights\" nor the import of intra-league play. The game has been referred to as the greatest inter-sectional rivalry in college football.[114][115][116][117][118] Notre Dame leads the series 51–37–5 through the 2023 season.[119] Stanford is USC's oldest rival,[120] in a series that dates to 1905. In the early years of football on the West Coast, the power sat in the Bay Area with the Stanford-Cal rivalry and USC rose to challenge the two established programs. During the early and mid-20th century Stanford football occasionally enjoyed periods of great regional success on the gridiron. USC and Stanford, being the two private universities with major football teams on the west coast, naturally drew the ire of one another. During the early 2000s, however, Stanford had not maintained their earlier success and the rivalry had faded to many USC fans.[120] The rivalry was renewed with the arrival of Jim Harbaugh at Stanford in 2007. Harbaugh defeated Carroll 2–1 in their three matchups with both victories occurring in the Coliseum. In the 2009 meeting, USC sustained their worst loss in 43 years and surrendered the most points to an opponent, a record that would stand for three seasons. The game led the Los Angeles Times to declare that Stanford was \"at the top of the USC 'Must Kill' list.\"[121][122] Harbaugh added another win in 2010 against Carroll's successor Lane Kiffin before leaving after that season to become head coach of the San Francisco 49ers. USC leads the series 65–34–3 through the 2023 season.[123] USC's rivalry with UCLA is unusual in that they are one of a few pairs of Division I FBS programs that share a major city, as well as conference. Both are located within the Los Angeles city limits, approximately 10 miles (16 km) apart. Until 1982, the two schools also shared the same stadium: the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The crosstown rivals play each year for city bragging rights and the Victory Bell; and often for the right to go to the Rose Bowl as representative for the Pac-12. The UCLA rivalry tends to draw the focus of student supporters since many USC students have friends or family members attending \"that other school\" (of course, many UCLA students refer to their USC friends in the same manner) and many Southern California families are divided between Trojan Cardinal and Bruin Blue. The annual matchup always has both teams wearing their traditional home uniforms, featuring a Cardinal vs Blue matchup. USC leads the all-time series 50–33–7 through the 2022 season.[124] Prior to the construction of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in 1923, the Trojans played football in a number of facilities.[125] Before 1893, the Trojans played football in a vacant lot on Jefferson Boulevard before the lot was developed as residences. In the 1890s, USC's primary home field was Athletic Park. Several games in the 1890s and all games in 1916 were played in Fiesta Park in downtown Los Angeles. The 1900 homestand was played at Chutes Park, a facility located within a Los Angeles pleasure park shared with the Los Angeles Angels baseball team, while the 1903 season was played at nearby Prager Park. Three games in the 1910s were played at Washington Park, the successor to Chutes Park. From 1904 to 1910, 1914–15, and 1917–22, most of USC's home games were played at the on-campus Bovard Field. USC also played home games in Pasadena, at Sportsman's Park, Tournament Park, and the Rose Bowl. The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum is one of the largest stadiums in the United States. USC has played football in the Coliseum ever since the grand stadium was built in 1923. In fact, the Trojans played in the first varsity football game ever held there (beating Pomona College 23–7 on October 6, 1923). The Coliseum hosted the opening and closing ceremonies and track events of the 1932 and 1984 Summer Olympics, and is slated to be a venue for the 2028 Summer Olympics. Over the years, the Coliseum has been home to many sports teams besides the Trojans, including UCLA football, the NFL's Los Angeles Rams and Raiders, the Los Angeles Chargers in 1960 of the AFL, and Los Angeles Dodgers baseball, including the 1959 World Series. The Coliseum has hosted various other events, from concerts and speeches to track meets and motorcycle races. The Coliseum is located on 17 acres (69,000 m2) in Exposition Park, which also houses museums, gardens and Banc of California Stadium.[126] It has also earned the nickname, “The Grand Old Lady.” The Coliseum is both managed and operated by USC[9] under a master lease agreement with the LA Memorial Coliseum Commission, as was the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena for a number of years prior to its 2016 demolition.[127] The Coliseum has a present full-capacity of 77,500 seats after USC completed a major $315 million renovation of the stadium in 2019 that added a new seven-story Tower on the stadium’s south side housing luxury suites, loge boxes, club seats, a new concourse with concession stands, a new press box, and rooftop club lounge.[128][129] Opened in 2012, the $70 Million, 110,000-square-foot athletic and academic center named after legendary football coach John McKay is home to the USC Trojan Football Department. The building houses meeting rooms, coaches' offices and a locker room for the football program, as well as the Stevens Academic Center (including space for tutoring, counseling, study and computer rooms for student-athletes), a weight room, an athletic training room and a state-of-the-art digital media production facility for all of USC's 21 sports.[130] The centerpiece of the McKay Center is the two-story video board in the Parker Hughes atrium, which can display six big-screen televisions at once as well as promotional videos and graphics. The building's 60,000-square-foot basement includes a weight room, athletic training room, locker rooms and a players lounge, a 25,000-square-foot ground floor with Student-Athlete Academic Services center, a reception area and outdoor courtyard, and a 25,000-square-foot second floor with football coaches' offices, football team meeting rooms, outdoor patio and a state-of-the-art video production facility. The John McKay Center is adjacent to Heritage Hall, the Galen Dining Center, Brittingham Field and the Howard Jones Field/Brian Kennedy Field practice facility.[130] The USC football team practices on campus at Howard Jones Field/Brian Kennedy Field. The facility originally known as Howard Jones Field was expanded in the fall of 1998 to include Brian Kennedy Field. In early 1999, Goux's Gate, named for the player and popular long-time assistant coach Marv Goux, was erected at the entrance to the practice field.[131] In June 2023 USC President Carl Folt announced that USC football will receive a new performance center that includes three levels dedicated to football team operations. The new 163,000 square foot complex is being built on the site of the current Brian Kennedy Field and includes two adjacent full-length outdoor practice fields – one turf and one natural grass – which players will access directly from the performance center and its three-story building. It will feature student-athlete-centric spaces - including a new locker room, multiple player lounges, a recovery hub, nutritional support, sports sciences services, a weight room, a training room and an equipment room - a team auditorium, position meeting rooms, recruiting areas, staff offices, a rooftop hospitality deck, and flexible space for future growth. Construction on the $200 million center began in 2024 and is scheduled for completion by summer 2026.[132] [133] Individual players have won numerous accolades with seven officially recognized Heisman Trophy winners, 38 College Football Hall of Fame inductees, and 157 All-Americans.[when?] USC's first consensus All-American was offensive guard Brice Taylor in 1925, who notably excelled despite missing his left hand, and who was one of USC's first black players. Eight USC players have been awarded the Heisman Trophy. All of them have also had their numbers retired by the Trojans.[134][135] In 2010, Bush's Heisman was forfeited after an NCAA investigation ruled him ineligible to participate as a student-athlete during his Trophy season. In 2024, Bush’s Heisman was reinstated and his number retired.[136][137] Chosen by Athlon Sports in 2001[139] Offense WR: Lynn Swann 71-73 WR: Keyshawn Johnson 92-95 TE: Hal Bedsole 61-63 OL: Ron Yary 65-67 OL: Tay Brown 30-32 OL: Tony Boselli 91-94 OL: John Baker 29-31 OL: Brad Budde 76-79 OL: Anthony Muñoz 76-79 OL: Bruce Matthews 80-82 QB: Pat Haden 72-74 RB: Mike Garrett 63-65 RB: O.

Sideline announcers have been Arbogast, Jackson, Tony Femino, Tim Ryan, Petros Papadakis, Lindsey Soto, Mark Willard and Brandon Hancock. Radio station KNX AM-1070 in Los Angeles has had the most years as the team's flagship station, holding that honor from 1956 to 1968 and again from 1977 to 1994. KFI AM-640 was the flagship from 1969 to 1972, KLSX FM-97.1 held the flag in 1998, followed by XTRA AM-690 in 1999 and 2000. From 2001 to 2005, KMPC AM-1540 was the Trojans' flagship station. KSPN AM-710 was the flagship from 2006 to 2018. Pete Arbogast, who has called Trojans football since 1989, announced his seventh Rose Bowl game on January 1, 2017. Arbogast also called the Rose Bowl game for USC for the university's campus radio station, KSCR, in 1978 and 1979. Arbogast, Kelly and Walden are all members of the Southern California Sportscasters Hall of Fame.

                "title": "Arkansas Razorbacks football - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Arkansas Razorbacks football program represents the University of Arkansas in the sport of American football. The Razorbacks compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and is a member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). Home games are played at stadiums on or near the two largest campuses of the University of Arkansas System: Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium in Fayetteville and War Memorial Stadium in Little Rock. Sam Pittman is the head coach and has served since 2020. The program began in 1894 and has compiled an all-time record of 740–539–40, for a .576 winning percentage. The Razorbacks have won 13 conference championships and have had 58 players honored as All-Americans. Arkansas claims one national championship (1964) awarded by the Football Writers Association of America (FWAA). The first University of Arkansas football team was formed in 1894 and coached by John Futrall, who was a Latin professor at the university.[3] That team played three games: two against Fort Smith High School and one against Texas.[3] Before the 1909 season, the teams were called the Arkansas Cardinals and a bird was the school's mascot.[4] The name and mascot changed following the 1909 season when the football team, coached by Hugo Bezdek, finished 7–0.[5] The Cardinals became the Razorbacks after Arkansas defeated LSU 7–0, and coach Bezdek told a group of reporters after the game that his team played like a \"wild band of Razorback hogs\". The name stuck, and the student body voted to change the mascot.[6][7] The \"Wooo Pig Sooie\" or \"Calling The Hogs\" became a tradition and the official school cheer in the 1920s when farmers rushing out to meet the bus returning from an away game called the hogs as a greeting.[8][9][10] Arkansas prevailed over powerhouses Oklahoma, LSU and Washington University in St. Louis in 1909, and was declared unofficial champions of the South and Southwest.[3] It was with the help of Steve Creekmore that this was accomplished. Creekmore became perhaps the first Razorback star, a quarterback from Van Buren who initially played only intramurals.[3] Bezdek used Creekmore to install a very early edition of the hurry-up offense, as the team never huddled and chased the ball after every play.[3] Creekmore was also known for \"fast and slippery running, blocking, and passing\" and could also return punts and tackle well.[3] There are differing stories about the origins of the 'Razorbacks' mascot, however. The Texarkana Arkansas High School mascot and athletic emblem is the Razorback with red and white serving as the school colors. The Razorback mascot was selected in 1910 to replace the Cardinal as the University of Arkansas mascot. In exchange for its use, the university provided used athletic gear to Texarkana Arkansas High; this practice is no longer used. With the new name and mascot, the Hogs defeated LSU 51–0 and gave Texas A&M their only loss in 1910, but fell short of another perfect season, losing 5–0 to Kansas State.[11] In 1913, Arkansas quarterback J. L. Carter and the Razorbacks lost to Ole Miss, and took a fateful train to Arkadelphia to play Ouachita Baptist. While Carter was eating, he was invited to a meeting of Ouachita boosters. He transferred (which took place immediately, this being permissible at the time) and defeated Arkansas 15–9 in 1914.[3] The Hogs would be contacted by L. Theo Bellmont in 1913 in his attempt to create an intercollegiate conference to regulate use of ringers.[12] Hugo Bezdek, since replaced by E. T. Pickering, had recommended that the Hogs join a conference before he left to coach at Oregon.[13] The Razorbacks joined the Southwest Conference (SWC) as charter members in 1915.[14] The conference also included teams from Texas (Baylor, Rice, Texas, Texas A&M) and Oklahoma (Oklahoma, Oklahoma A&M).[15] Southwestern (TX) would also join, but leave the following year.[16] The 1916, 1917, and 1919 teams were led at quarterback by \"Arkansas' greatest athlete\" Gene Davidson.[17] The Razorbacks didn't have a winning conference record until 1920, and didn't win the conference championship until 1936. Arkansas had the best record during the 1933 season, but had to forfeit the SWC Championship because Ulysses \"Heine\" Schleuter, who had no eligibility remaining, played on the team.[18] Schleuter had told coach Fred Thomsen that he was eligible, but he was recognized by an SMU player during the game as a former Cornhusker.[18] The Hogs did accept an invitation to the 1934 Dixie Classic, a precursor to today's Cotton Bowl Classic.[19] Arkansas became rivals with Ole Miss due to proximity. Although not SWC members, Ole Miss played Arkansas intermittently until a yearly series began from 1952–1961. During the 1938 season, the Razorbacks replaced their 300-seat stadium known as The Hill with Bailey Stadium, named after Arkansas governor Carl Bailey.[20] It was known as University Stadium for one game before being changed to honor the governor.[21] This stadium still exists today, although heavily renovated, as Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium, the current home of the Razorbacks.[21] Arkansas won the conference championship in 1946,[22] earning a bid in the 1947 Cotton Bowl Classic with LSU.[23] The game would become known as the Ice Bowl, as a winter storm hit Dallas before the game.[24] The two rivals battled to a scoreless tie, with Razorback great Clyde Scott tackling an LSU Tiger at the one yard-line to preserve the tie on the second-to-last play of the game.[23] LSU would fail to complete the field goal attempt on the next play.[24] The Razorbacks defeated William & Mary the next year in the 1948 Dixie Bowl.[25] In 1954, the Ole Miss rivalry would catch fire. The Hogs played the Rebels in War Memorial Stadium on October 23, 1954.[26] The Rebels were ranked No. 5 by the AP Poll entering the game, and Arkansas was picked to finish last in the SWC.[27] The contest would be decided by a 66-yard halfback pass from tailback Buddy Bob Benson to blocking back Preston Carpenter, the only score of the game. This is referred to as the Powder River Play, and \"perhaps the most important in Arkansas football history to that time\" by Orville Henry, a member of the 1954 team.[28] The Hogs would get back to the Cotton Bowl Classic in 1954, only to be defeated by Georgia Tech.[29] Future Arkansas head coach Frank Broyles was an assistant under Yellowjackets head coach Bobby Dodd in the game.[30] The 1954 season was all the more impressive when it is considered that the team only had twenty-five players on the squad. That team, dubbed the \"25 Little Pigs\" and coached by Bowden Wyatt, finished 8-3 and won the Southwest Conference championship. During this period, Arkansas developed rivalries with Texas and Texas A&M because of their intense conference match-ups.[31][32][33][34] Missouri head coach Frank Broyles was hired as the Razorbacks head football coach in 1957 and served in that position for 19 years.[35] Arkansas would grow into a national power with Broyles at the helm, including several conference championships and a national title.[36] Arkansas would earn a share of the 1959 SWC Championship, splitting with Texas.[37] Arkansas lost only to No. 3 Texas and No. 6 Ole Miss during the season.[38] The Hogs went to Jacksonville and defeated Georgia Tech in the 1960 Gator Bowl 14–7, avenging an earlier Cotton Bowl Classic defeat.[39] Barry Switzer was a co-captain on the team.[40] Some, including University Chancellor and student during 1958, John White,[41] view the Razorback football team during this period as a revival of Arkansas, which was recovering from the Little Rock Nine and racial segregation problems.[41] The 1960s was the best decade in Arkansas football history.[42] 1960 brought another SWC crown, and a Cotton Bowl Classic invitation for the Hogs, who were ranked as high as 7th during the season.[43] The Razorbacks lost to No. 2 Ole Miss and No. 20 Baylor, but defeated No. 11 Texas in Austin, bringing the championship to Fayetteville.[44] The Hogs lost to Duke, 7–6, because of a blocked extra point.[45] The following season brought another shared SWC championship with Texas.[46] The Hogs were defeated by the Longhorns 33–7,[31][47][48] as well as the No. 9 Ole Miss Rebels,[49] warranting an invitation to New Orleans, Louisiana, for the Sugar Bowl.[50] No. 1 Alabama defeated the Razorbacks 10–3.[51] The Crimson Tide had been declared national champions before the game, which was the procedure at the time. The Hogs would fight this system in 1964, when the same Alabama team would claim the 1964 AP crown before losing the Orange Bowl to the Texas Longhorns, a team Arkansas defeated in Austin, Texas, during the regular season.[52] Arkansas won the Cotton Bowl Classic over Nebraska, 10–7.[53] Broyles' team was awarded the 1964 National Championship by the Football Writers Association of America and the Helms Athletic Foundation.[54][55] The FWAA and HAF awarded their national championships to Arkansas, who was the only team to go undefeated through the bowl games that year. At the time, the Associated Press (AP) and UPI awarded their national titles before the bowl games, and gave their trophies to the Alabama team that would lose in the Orange Bowl game a few days later.[56] The next season, 1965, the Razorbacks were 10–0 in the regular season, and were once again the Southwest Conference Champions.[57] That sent the Razorbacks back to the Cotton Bowl Classic on New Year's Day, this time to play against LSU.[58] Because of the controversy in determining the national champions in 1964, the AP poll would wait until after the bowl games to announce its champion. With top-ranked Michigan State losing in the Rose Bowl,[59] the No. 2 Razorbacks had a chance to become national champions, but were defeated 14–7 by the Tigers.[60] Arkansas would return to the field in 1966 ranked fifth, but losses against unranked Baylor and Texas Tech would prevent the 8–2 Hogs from playing in a bowl game.[61] Loyd Phillips was a consensus All-American defensive tackle on the team.[62] Phillips also took home the Outland Trophy.[63] After struggling to a 4–5–1 record in 1967,[64] the Hogs went 10–1 and returned to the postseason in 1968.[65] No. 9 Arkansas defeated No. 2 Georgia in the Sugar Bowl, 16–2.[66] Sophomore receiver Chuck Dicus scored the only touchdown of the game for the Razorbacks.[67][68] In 1969, the Razorbacks had another chance to claim the national title, when No. 2 Arkansas played the No. 1 Texas Longhorns, coached by Darrell Royal, at Razorback Stadium in Fayetteville, Arkansas.[69] The game, known as \"The Big Shootout\" or the Game of the Century, is perhaps the most notable football game in Razorbacks history.[70] Arkansas led 14–0 at after three quarters, but Texas stormed back and took a 15–14 lead on a two-point conversion, after a questionable passing play was called late in the game by then coach Frank Broyles, which was intercepted by Texas.[71] President Richard Nixon was in attendance, and proclaimed Texas the national champions, even though they had a bowl game to play, and Penn State was also undefeated.[69][72] Arkansas lost to Ole Miss in the Sugar Bowl, 27–22, and Texas beat Notre Dame in the Cotton Bowl Classic for the national title.[73] The 1970s brought more success for Broyles, led by Razorback standouts Chuck Dicus and Ben Cowins.[74][75][76] The 1970 Razorbacks would go 9–2, with the nine consecutive wins bookended by losses in the opener to No. 10 Stanford and the finale to No. 1 Texas.[77] The 1971 Razorbacks went 8–3–1, including upset wins over No. 7 Cal and No. 10 Texas.[78] They were invited to the Liberty Bowl, but lost to No. 9 Tennessee 14–13.[79] The 1972–1974 seasons would be mediocre, as Arkansas struggled to defeat the Texas teams.[80][81][82] The Hogs went 11–8–2 against schools in Texas, but failed to beat the University of Texas during the span. The highlight of the period was an upset of No. 5 USC in War Memorial Stadium in 1974.[83] Broyles would win his seventh and final Southwest Conference championship in 1975. The contest with Texas A&M was moved until the end of the year, as it was expected to decide the Southwest Conference championship. The Razorbacks did not disappoint, as Arkansas defeated No. 2 Texas A&M, 31–6, in War Memorial Stadium. The win forced the Aggies to share the conference championship with Texas and Arkansas. However, the tie-breaker went to Arkansas, thus Arkansas received the invitation to the Cotton Bowl Classic. The Cotton Bowl Classic berth would also be Broyles' last appearance. Arkansas would fall behind Georgia early on in that game, but came roaring back to beat the Bulldogs easily, 31–10. Arkansas finished with a 10–2 record and finished ranked No. 7 in the AP and No. 6 in the UPI that season.[84] Broyles coached the Razorbacks in 1976, but with limited success, compiling a 5–5–1 record.[85] Broyles retired as Arkansas head coach following the 1976 season,[86] but served as the university's athletics director until December 31, 2007.[87][88] He is now arguably one of the best college football coaches to coach Arkansas. After Broyles left coaching and became athletic director at Arkansas, he hired New York Jets head coach Lou Holtz to take his former position.[89] Holtz served as head football coach from 1977 through the 1983 season. Holtz led the Razorbacks through a 10–1 regular season in 1977, losing only to No. 2 Texas.[90] The No. 6 Hogs were invited to play in the Orange Bowl against No. 2 Oklahoma.[91] The Sooners had a chance to become national champions with a win over the shorthanded Razorbacks, who had suffered a season-long rash of injuries and player suspensions. Prior to Christmas, the university announced that star running back Ben Cowins, leading receiver Donny Bobo, and back-up running back Michael Forrest would all be sent back to Fayetteville.[92][93] Following the suspensions, numerous African-American players on the team threatened to boycott the game.[94][95] The always-quotable Holtz said two days before the game, \"I'm one step short of suicide\".[93] The Razorbacks found an unlikely hero in Roland Sales, who rushed for 205 yards on 23 carries and two scores.[96] Sales also led the Hogs in receiving in the contest.[97] In addition, Holtz used third-string running back Randy Richey, who added 98 rushing yards and a touchdown on only 5 carries. The Hogs ended the Sooners' hope with a 31–6 victory.[60] This game is notable as one of the biggest upsets in Razorback football history. Ironically, University of Arkansas alumnus Barry Switzer coached the Sooners in the contest, and late in the game, future Arkansas head coach Houston Nutt played quarterback for Holtz.[98] Arkansas finished the season 11-1 and was selected as a co-national champion for the 1977 season by the Rothman Foundation for the Analysis of Competitions and Tournaments (Rothman (FACT)), along with Notre Dame and Texas, but the university does not claim this title.[99][100][101] In 1978, the Razorbacks went 9–2 during the regular season, losing back-to-back games at No. 8 Texas and No. 11 Houston.[102] A 49–7 win over No. 16 Texas A&M did give the Hogs a Fiesta Bowl berth,[103] but the Razorbacks and UCLA Bruins would battle to a 10–10 tie, as the Razorbacks finished 9–2–1.[104] In 1979, Holtz's Razorbacks won a share of the Southwest Conference (sharing with Houston). The 10–2 Hogs[105] defeated nemesis No. 2 Texas in Little Rock,[106] but lost an outright conference title to No. 6 Houston in Fayetteville.[107] Earning a bid to the Sugar Bowl, the No. 6 Hogs were set to play No. 2 Alabama with a chance at the national championship.[108] Instead, Alabama defeated the Razorbacks 24–9, winning their sixth claimed national title.[60] The Razorbacks would continue to succeed under Holtz, winning the 1980 Hall of Fame Classic following the 1980 regular season[109] and defeating No. 1 Texas by a score of 42–11 in 1981.[110] Despite winning the 1982 Bluebonnet Bowl over the Florida Gators and finishing 9–2–1 in 1982,[111] a 6–5 season in 1983[112] would be the end of the Holtz era.[113] At the time, athletic director Frank Broyles stated that Holtz had resigned and was not fired, but two decades later Broyles acknowledged that Holtz was indeed fired because his actions were negatively affecting the fan base.[114] Holtz would subsequently be hired by Minnesota.[115] Reports also cited his political involvement as a major reason for his firing: controversy arose over his having taped two television advertisements from his coach's office endorsing the re-election of Jesse Helms as Senator from North Carolina at a time when Helms was leading the effort to block Martin Luther King Day from becoming a national holiday.[116][117] Holtz left the program with a mark of 60–21–2.[118] His teams reached six consecutive bowls (1977–1982), but only won one split conference championship. Holtz used a very conservative option offense.[119] Ken Hatfield replaced Holtz in 1984. Hatfield played defensive back for Broyles on the 1964 national championship team, and was an All-American punt returner. It was Hatfield's punt return for a touchdown that beat No. 1 Texas in Austin in 1964 that propelled that team to finish undefeated. Hatfield finished his six-year tenure at Arkansas with a record of 55–17–1 and won back-to-back Southwest Conference titles in 1988 and 1989, Hatfield's last two years, and to date the Razorbacks' most recent conference championships. Hatfield would win seventy-six percent of his games at Arkansas, which is still a record today. He coached three teams to ten-win seasons in 1985, 1988, and 1989, and his 1986 and 1987 teams won nine games. But Hatfield was not successful in bowl games, only winning one (1985 Holiday Bowl) out of six. Hatfield was also criticized for being too conservative in the play-calling of his flexbone offense, with many fans noting that the team only threw three passes the entire game in a 16–14 loss to Texas in 1987, when the Longhorns scored a touchdown on the last play of the game to upset Arkansas. The Hatfield-led Razorbacks also lost to Texas in 1985 by a score of 15–13, when the Texas placekicker successfully made all five of his field goal attempts, but the Arkansas kicker missed two of four attempts. Hatfield would switch to the option-I formation prior to the 1989 season. Hatfield was also criticized for finishing with a losing record against Texas, going 2–4, with both victories on the road in Austin, Texas. Despite this success, Hatfield had a somewhat frosty relationship with Broyles, and lost out on several key recruits when other coaches spread rumors that he was in Broyles' doghouse. When Broyles signed a new five-year contract as athletic director, Hatfield abruptly resigned less than two weeks after losing the 1990 Cotton Bowl Classic with a ten-win team to accept the head coaching post at Clemson without ever visiting the Clemson campus before taking the job.[120][121] Hatfield would go on to coach Clemson for four years, winning two bowl games and an ACC championship in 1991, before leaving to coach the Rice Owls for twelve seasons and winning a share of the SWC championship in 1994. During this period, Broyles engineered Arkansas' move from the Southwest Conference to the Southeastern Conference (SEC), effective with the 1992 season.[122] When Hatfield announced he was leaving for Clemson, Broyles was in a difficult situation. Not only was there nowhere near enough time to find a big-name coach, but National Signing Day was only three weeks away. Broyles persuaded Jack Crowe, who had just come to Fayetteville as offensive coordinator, to drop his initial plans to follow Hatfield to Clemson and take over as head coach of the Razorbacks. The decision came as something of a surprise, since Crowe had only won five games in two seasons at Livingston University in the late 1970s. By the start of the season, the Razorbacks had seen Barry Foster give up his senior season to enter the 1990 NFL draft and had lost numerous other players to disciplinary and academic problems. Under the circumstances, the Razorbacks struggled to a 3–8 record–their first losing season since 1967, and only their fifth sub-.500 record since the 1950s. They barely qualified for a bowl in 1991.[121] The Razorbacks opened the 1992 season—their first in the Southeastern Conference—with an upset loss to a Division I-AA team, The Citadel. The next day, Broyles announced that Crowe had resigned and that defensive coordinator Joe Kines would coach the Razorbacks for the rest of the season.[123] However, Crowe's lawyer subsequently told Sports Illustrated that Crowe had been fired, and Broyles admitted that he'd fired Crowe due to concern that the fans no longer had confidence in him.[121] He finished 9–15 in two seasons and one game in Fayetteville.[124] Joe Kines brought Danny Ford to Arkansas in 1992 to help with the clean-up following Frank Broyles' firing of Jack Crowe (Ford's former offensive coordinator at Clemson) after a loss to the Citadel. This immediately led to speculation that Ford would be named head coach on a permanent basis. The speculation bore fruit after the season, when Ford was named head coach. He led Arkansas to its first SEC West championship in 1995 on the legs of Madre Hill and the defensive genius of Joe Lee Dunn, after emerging from two years under Crowe. However, this was one of only two winning seasons the Razorbacks notched during Ford's tenure. Broyles fired Ford following back-to-back 4–7 campaigns. Ford finished 26–30–1 in five seasons with the Razorbacks.[125] It was ironic that Ford ended up at Arkansas, since his replacement at Clemson was former Razorback head coach Ken Hatfield, who had had his own falling out with Arkansas athletic director Frank Broyles. Hatfield took the Clemson job in January 1990, less than a week after Ford resigned, without even visiting the campus. Ford proved to be a solid recruiter, as his replacement at Arkansas, Houston Nutt, went on to win 17 games in the 1998 (9–3) and 1999 (8–4) seasons combined, to include a 1998 SEC West co-championship and a Cotton Bowl championship on January 1, 2000, with a victory over Texas. Both of those squads were made up primarily of players Ford had recruited to Arkansas. On December 10, 1997, Boise State head coach Houston Nutt was hired by the University of Arkansas to succeed Danny Ford.[126] Upon his arrival at Arkansas, Nutt invigorated the Hog fan base with his enthusiasm and high energy.[127] Under Nutt, the Razorbacks were one of three SEC schools to play in three New Year's Day bowls within five years. Nutt's teams were noted for a series of overtime games, including the two longest overtime games in NCAA history. Off the field, some of Nutt's players were named to the SEC Academic Honor Roll 145 times[128] and he has established a reputation as a responsible coach academically.[129] Nutt received some criticism for a SEC win–loss record that was just barely over .500 and because he calls his own offensive plays during a game instead of relying on an offensive coordinator.[130] In his first six seasons, Nutt led the team to a bowl game each year and averaged eight wins per season.[130] Nutt's Razorbacks were picked to finish last in the Southeastern Conference Western Division in 1998 but ended up with a 9–3 record and a share of the division title.[131] The Razorbacks lost to the eventual national champion Tennessee Volunteers on Tennessee's home field after quarterback Clint Stoerner fumbled while trying to run out the clock. For their efforts, the Razorbacks received their first-ever invitation to the Citrus Bowl and ended the season ranked No. 16 after losing to Michigan.[132][133][134] Nutt was selected as the Football News' National Coach of the Year.[135] In 1999, Nutt's Razorbacks were picked to win the SEC Western Division, but suffered a series of setbacks during the season. They recovered to defeat nationally ranked Tennessee and Mississippi State to earn a Cotton Bowl Classic bid versus arch-rival Texas.[136] The Razorbacks defeated Texas 27–6,[137] becoming the first team to ever hold Texas to negative rushing yards in a game.[138] The Cotton Bowl victory propelled Arkansas into the top 20 to end the season. The 2000 season saw the Razorbacks lose the core of their team and suffer a string of injuries, including season-ending injuries to all of the starting running backs. The Razorbacks struggled throughout the season until the final two games when they defeated ranked Mississippi State and LSU teams to pull out another winning record and a Las Vegas Bowl appearance.[139] In the 2001 season, the Razorbacks started off with three straight losses in SEC play. On November 3, 2001, Arkansas defeated Ole Miss 58–56 in 7 overtimes, a record for the longest college football game at the time.[140] The Rebels, led by freshman quarterback Eli Manning, took their second loss of the 2001 season after failing to complete a 4-yard Two-point conversion in the seventh OT period.[141] \"It was gladiator-like,\" Nutt said after the game. \"TD after TD. Two points after two points.\"[142] They then came back to win six of the last seven including victories over ranked South Carolina and Auburn teams. Based on this performance, the Razorbacks were selected to return to the Cotton Bowl Classic to face the defending national champion Oklahoma Sooners. Arkansas lost, gaining only 50 yards of total offense and just six first downs. Nutt was named SEC coach of the year by the Associated Press and by the SEC coaches.[143] In 2002, Nutt's Razorbacks stumbled midway through the season but pulled together five straight wins, including a last second touchdown pass against LSU,[144] often referred to as the \"Miracle on Markham\"[145] to pull out a share of a Western Division title. Arkansas was defeated by the Georgia Bulldogs in the SEC Championship Game[146] and ended the season with a loss to Minnesota in the Music City Bowl.[147][148] In 2003, Nutt's team started off with a 4–0 record including a win against No. 5 Texas on their home field. The early season success raised fan expectations sky-high and put Nutt under intense pressure when the Razorbacks lost their next three games, putting them out of contention for the national championship or even the SEC Western Division crown. The Razorbacks won four of their final five games and defeated Missouri in the Independence Bowl.[149] After the 2003 season, Nebraska was rumored to be courting Nutt to be their head coach, after the firing of Frank Solich.[150] The 2004 and 2005 campaigns were widely expected to be rebuilding years due to young teams. The 2004 season ended with a 5–6 record and without a bowl invitation for the first time under Nutt.[151] The 2005 season was also a rebuilding year as expected.[152] Tough losses to USC (70–17) as well as to Vanderbilt and South Carolina showed that the season had been predicted accurately. The team was ineligible for a bowl for the second season in a row (and the second season overall under coach Nutt). This led to Razorback fans calling for coaching changes. After meeting with Frank Broyles (athletic director) at the conclusion of the season, coaching changes were made by Nutt in the offseason at the risk of being fired, the most notable of which was the forced addition of Gus Malzahn, previously the head coach at Springdale High School in Springdale, Arkansas, as offensive coordinator.[153] The hiring of Malzahn allowed Nutt to sign several highly recruited Springdale players, including Springdale High School quarterback Mitch Mustain and wide receiver Damian Williams who eventually transferred to USC.[154][155] The 2006 season began with a new offensive coordinator in Malzahn. The Razorbacks started the season losing 50–14, at a home game in Fayetteville, to USC. Following the loss to the Trojans, Nutt announced that Mustain would replace Robert Johnson as the Hogs' starting quarterback. Mustain led Arkansas to eight straight wins, including wins against No. 22 Alabama at home and No. 2 Auburn at Auburn, before losing the starting job to Casey Dick. Dick had been slotted to start at the beginning of the season but was unable to do so due to a back injury suffered in the spring. Dick led the Razorbacks to two victories out of four for a total of 10 wins, including a win over No. 13 Tennessee. The Razorbacks moved to No. 7 in the BCS standings. However, the Hogs lost their last regular season game to the No. 8 LSU Tigers, 31–26. Despite the loss, the Hogs were still Western Division Champions of the SEC, and played the 11–1, fourth-ranked Florida Gators for the SEC Championship. Florida won, 38–28. The Razorbacks then lost to the No. 5 Wisconsin Badgers on New Year's Day, 2007 in the Capital One Bowl. A highlight of the season was the second-place finish of sophomore tailback Darren McFadden in the Heisman Trophy voting. Nutt was named SEC coach of the year by the Associated Press and by the SEC coaches for the second time. The Razorbacks finished the season at 10–4.[156] The 2007 season began with the Razorbacks ranked No. 21 by the AP Poll. The Hogs opened at home with a victory over Troy. However, early losses to Alabama and Kentucky knocked Arkansas out of the rankings and made the remaining SEC schedule an uphill struggle, even with Darren McFadden, Felix Jones, and Peyton Hillis in the Razorback backfield.[157] Fan frustration boiled over to some fans wearing all black T-shirts with anti-Nutt statements and buying an entire page in a local Little Rock newspaper calling for Nutt to be fired. A non-official flyover was made hours before the Auburn home game with a small airplane holding a banner, which read: \"Fire Houston Nutt. Players and fans deserve better.\" On November 23, 2007, in Baton Rouge, Nutt's Razorbacks beat the top-ranked football team in the nation on the road.[158][159] In a game that lasted three overtimes, Arkansas defeated eventual national champion LSU Tigers, 50–48, returning the Golden Boot back to Arkansas.[160] Arkansas finished the season with an 8–5 record.[161] Three days later, Nutt resigned as head coach of the Arkansas Razorbacks amid several controversies and rumors,[162] which had come prior to and throughout the 2007 season.[163][164] He left the school with a 75–48 record,[165] which is second on the school's all-time win list, behind only Frank Broyles.[166] On December 11, 2007, former Louisville head coach Bobby Petrino came to Arkansas from the NFL's Atlanta Falcons to become the Razorbacks' 31st head coach.[167][168] Petrino was regarded as an up-and-coming college coach who, despite his failed 11-month stint with the Falcons, had led Louisville to 41 wins in 50 games and was regarded as one of the nation's brilliant offensive minds, employing a spread hybrid offense.[169][170][171] Hired by newly hired athletic director Jeff Long, Petrino signed a five-year contract worth $2.85 million per year with the university administration.[172] The 2008 season was expected to be a transition year for the team and Petrino.[173] Though eliminated from bowl contention, Petrino led the Razorbacks to a last-second victory over rival and defending national champions LSU[174] (nicknamed the Miracle on Markham II)[175] to finish the season 5–7 and a conference mark of 2–6.[176] Petrino's 2009 Razorbacks made dramatic improvement.[177][178] Led by Michigan transfer Ryan Mallett at quarterback,[179] the Razorbacks nearly defeated the Tim Tebow-led Florida Gators, who were ranked No. 1 in the country at that time, in Gainesville, Florida.[180] The Hogs went on to win the 2010 Liberty Bowl against East Carolina[181] and finish with a record of 8–5.[182] The 2010 Arkansas Razorbacks improved on their 2009 record and won six in a row to end the year after earlier losses to Alabama and Auburn.[183][184] Arkansas finished the season 10–2 overall and earned a BCS bowl berth,[185] the first in Arkansas history.[186][187] The Razorbacks lost the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans against the sixth ranked Ohio State Buckeyes by a score of 31–26.[188] Though the result was later vacated by the NCAA as a result of sanctions against Ohio State,[189] the game was the first game ever played between the two teams.[190] Under Petrino's tutelage, quarterback Ryan Mallett broke numerous school passing records in 2010 as well.[191][192] On December 11, 2010, Petrino received a seven-year contract extension from the University of Arkansas administration.[193][194] In 2011, the reins were handed to Tyler Wilson after Mallett went to the NFL.[195] Wilson picked up where Mallett left off, and Arkansas spent more than half the season ranked in the top ten.[196] After beating Kansas State in the Cotton Bowl Classic by a score of 29–16,[197] the Razorbacks finished with an 11–2 record and a No. 5 final ranking in the AP poll,[198] the school's highest ranking since 1977. The eleven wins also tied a school record.[199][200] The only two teams to beat the Hogs that year were Alabama[201] and LSU,[202] the two teams that played each other for the national championship.[203] On April 1, 2012, Petrino was involved in a single-vehicle motorcycle crash in rural Madison County, near Crosses.[204] After initially stating publicly that he was alone, both in a written press release and during a press conference, it was discovered in the police report of the accident that Petrino had been riding with a passenger, former Arkansas All-SEC volleyball player Jessica Dorrell.[205] In his acknowledgement of the report, Petrino admitted to having engaged in a \"previous inappropriate relationship\" with Dorrell.[206] As a result of this information, athletics director Jeff Long placed Petrino on paid administrative leave, pending an investigation.[207][208] On April 10, 2012, after his investigation, Long announced that he had fired Petrino with cause, saying that Petrino \"engaged in a pattern of misleading and manipulative behavior designed to deceive me and members of the athletic staff, both before and after the motorcycle accident.\"[209] He also revealed that in addition to his previously undisclosed personal relationship, Petrino had secretly paid Dorrell $20,000 and had used his influence to ensure that she was selected from an applicant pool of 159 people for a position on the football coaching staff.[210] Long believed the payment could expose Arkansas to a sexual harassment suit if Petrino were retained.[211][212][213] Petrino left Arkansas with a 34–17 record.[214] On April 23, 2012, Petrino's coaching mentor, John L. Smith, was announced as Arkansas' 32nd head football coach.[215] Smith signed a 10-month contract worth $850,000.[216] While the length of the contract made it appear that Smith was merely an interim hire, Arkansas' official announcement described Smith as \"head coach,\" without any qualifier. School officials did announce that the 10-month contract would give them a chance to \"identify a head coach for the future of the program.\"[217] Smith's hiring was ironic, as Petrino had succeeded Smith as head coach at Louisville. Just four months earlier, Smith had accepted the head coaching position at his alma mater Weber State after serving under Petrino as special teams coordinator for the Razorbacks. Smith's hiring was met both with approval and some controversy. A significant number of current players expressed their strong approval for the Smith hire.[218] However, some critics argued that he had abandoned his previous post at Weber State after only 4+1⁄2 months. ESPN's Gene Wojciechowski claimed Smith was merely \"leasing himself to the Razorbacks for a year.\"[219] The Razorbacks struggled to a 4–8 record in 2012[220] despite starting the season with high expectations and being ranked in the Top 10 nationally. Smith was not retained after the season. On December 4, 2012, it was announced that Bret Bielema would leave the Wisconsin Badgers to become the 33rd head coach in Arkansas history.[221][222] Bielema's first season at Arkansas resulted in an overall record of 3–9, 0–8 in the SEC.[223] It was the Razorbacks' worst SEC mark since entering the league in 1992 and their first winless in-conference season since 1942, when they were a member of the Southwest Conference.[224] Bielema's second season saw him improve on his first, as Arkansas finished 7–6.[225] Bielema won his first two SEC games in dominating fashion in November, beating No. 17 LSU 17–0 on November 15, 2014, and No. 8 Ole Miss 30–0 on November 22, 2014, to achieve bowl eligibility. Though Arkansas lost its remaining conference game against Missouri, they still achieved a Texas Bowl victory in the postseason, defeating Texas 31–7.[226] In Bielema's third season, the Razorbacks got off to a slow start, losing to Toledo and Texas Tech and starting 2–4. The Hogs then caught fire in the second half of the season, going 5–1 over the final six games, with the only loss coming to Mississippi State on a blocked field goal. Arkansas ended the year by beating Kansas State 45–23 in the Liberty Bowl, to finish the season with a record of 8–5.[227] Bielema's fourth season was a topsy-turvy 7–6[228] campaign that ended with two embarrassing defeats at the hands of Missouri in the regular season finale and Virginia Tech in the Belk Bowl.[229][230] The former saw his team blow a 17–point halftime lead and the latter was a 24–point blown halftime lead, the largest for Arkansas since at least 1952.[231] Following the 2016 season, Bielema hired Central Michigan head coach Dan Enos as the team's offensive coordinator.[232] The Hogs went downhill in their 2017 season, finishing 4–8. Bielema was fired on the field by interim athletic director Julie Cromer minutes after concluding his fifth season with a 48–45 loss to Missouri on November 24, 2017.[233] After Bielema's firing, Arkansas initially pursued Auburn head coach and former Razorbacks offensive coordinator Gus Malzahn with a lucrative contract offer to become the Razorbacks head coach, but Malzahn opted to remain at Auburn and signed an extension with the Tigers.[234][235][236] On December 6, 2017, SMU head coach Chad Morris was formally introduced as the 34th head coach of the Arkansas Razorbacks.[237][238] Prior to turning around a dismal SMU program in his three years as head coach, Morris solidified himself as one of the nation's best offensive minds during his stint as offensive coordinator at Clemson under Dabo Swinney, instituting a fast-paced spread offense that set school records.[239][240] The University of Arkansas administration signed Morris to a six-year contract worth $3.5 million annually.[241] In 2018, the Razorbacks finished last in the SEC conference with a 0–8 standing and 2–10 overall win-loss record.[242] In 2019, Coach Morris failed to improve upon Arkansas' disappointing 2018 result. Once again, the Hogs wound up last in the SEC with a 0–8 conference record and another 2–10 overall standing.[243] Chad Morris was fired on November 10, 2019, concluding his tenure with a 4–18 (0–14 in the SEC) record.[244] On December 8, 2019, Georgia's offensive line and associate head coach Sam Pittman was announced as the new head coach for the University of Arkansas. It was his first head coaching job.[245] On October 3, 2020, he led the Razorbacks to their first SEC win since they beat Ole Miss in 2017. The Razorbacks finished the season with a 3–7 record in an all SEC schedule due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Arkansas was invited to play in the Mercari Texas Bowl against Texas Christian University. However, due to COVID-19 issues on TCU, the game was canceled.[246] In 2021, he coached the Razorbacks to a 9–4 record and a 24–10 victory over the Penn State Nittany Lions in the 2022 Outback Bowl in Tampa, Florida on New Year's Day. The season included victories over the Texas Longhorns (Arkansas' first win over Texas in Fayetteville since 1981), the Texas A&M Aggies (which ended a 9-game losing streak to A&M), the LSU Tigers and the Missouri Tigers (ending 5-game losing streaks to both schools). The wins over Texas A&M, LSU, and Missouri also meant Arkansas was in possession of all three rivalry trophies (Southwest Classic Trophy, Golden Boot Trophy, Battle Line Rivalry Trophy) in the same season. Pittman was named the 2021 AFCA Region 2 Coach of the Year. Pittman's team started off strong in 2022, winning its first three games and eventually reached No. 10 in the polls before losing a close contest to Texas A&M, which was highlighted by a fumble on the goal line by KJ Jefferson and a field goal miss off the goalpost by kicker Cam Little. They would then lose in consecutive weeks to No. 2 Alabama 49–26 and No. 23 Mississippi State 40–17. They rebounded by defeating BYU and Auburn on the road, but suffered close home losses to Liberty and rival No. 7 LSU. In the Liberty game, they did not get the potential game-tying two-point conversion due to Jefferson's knee being down before he reached the end zone. They beat No. 14 Ole Miss 42–27 the following week and achieved bowl eligibility heading into their rivalry game with Missouri. The team would successfully defeat the Kansas Jayhawks 55–53 in triple overtime in the 2022 Liberty Bowl. 2023 saw the team limp to a 4–8 record, the worst record in a non-COVID season since Pittman took over for Morris after the 2019 campaign, although it did see the Hogs beat Florida in Gainesville for the first time in program history[247]. Pittman had fired offensive coordinator Dan Enos after eight games in 2023, and after the year concluded, Pittman announced they would be hiring former head coach Bobby Petrino as offensive coordinator. Petrino's offense, which included bringing in transfer quarterback Taylen Green, helped the team finish a little better in 2024, as they ended up 6-6 and made the 2024 Liberty Bowl. Arkansas has been affiliated with the following conferences.[248]: 189–190 Arkansas has been named national champion twice by NCAA-designated major selectors.[54][249]: 113–114 Arkansas claims the 1964 championship but does not claim the co-national championship the program was awarded in 1977 by the Rothman (FACT) poll after the Razorbacks finished the season with an 11–1 record and defeated #2 Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl, 31–6.[248]: 156 In 1964, the Razorbacks finished the season as the only major team with an undefeated and untied record (11–0) after No. 1 Alabama lost to Texas in the Orange Bowl (and after Arkansas previously defeated Texas in Austin, TX that season). However, the AP and Coaches Polls became final before the bowl games were played, leaving one-loss Alabama as the AP and UPI national champion. The Football Writers Association of America (FWAA) and Helms Athletic Foundation (Helms) conducted their final polling after the bowl games and selected Arkansas as the national champion.[250][251][252] Arkansas has won 13 conference championships, all during their tenure in the Southwest Conference.[248]: 16 † Co-champions Arkansas has won four division championships, all within the SEC Western Division.[248]: 16 Arkansas has made three appearances in the SEC Championship Game as winner of the SEC Western Division but are 0–3 in those appearances.[253] Arkansas was also the SEC Western Division co-champions in 1998 with Mississippi State but lost to the Bulldogs during the regular season, resulting in Mississippi State representing the West in the SEC Championship Game. In 2002, Alabama had the best conference record in the West with a 6–2 mark, but was on probation by the NCAA and was barred from post season play. Arkansas played in the SEC Championship Game due to winning the tiebreaker for a three-way tie with Auburn and LSU, both of whom Arkansas defeated during the regular season. † - Co-champions There have been 36 head coaches of Arkansas.[254][248]: 190 [255] Barry Lunney Jr. became the interim head coach on November 11, 2019, after the firing of Chad Morris.[256] † Interim head coach The Razorbacks have appeared in 45 bowl games with an overall record of 18–24–3.[248]: 206 [257] Arkansas has been invited to multiple Cotton Bowl Classics (12 games, 4–7–1 record), Sugar Bowls (6 games, 1–5 record), and Liberty Bowls (6 games, 3–3 record). Arkansas has faced current or future fellow SEC members in multiple bowl games as follows: Georgia (4 times); Oklahoma (3 times); and Alabama, LSU, Ole Miss, Missouri, Tennessee, Texas (2 times each). Arkansas has faced current or future out of conference opponents Georgia Tech, Kansas State, North Carolina, and UCLA in two bowl games each. Since joining the Southeastern Conference in 1992, the Razorbacks have developed a rivalry with the LSU Tigers. The game was played annually the day after Thanksgiving and was televised on CBS until 2014 when LSU played Texas A&M on Thanksgiving and Arkansas played Missouri that week. The winner of the game has taken home the \"Golden Boot\", which is a 24-karat gold trophy in the shape of the two states, since its creation in 1996.[258] In 2002, the rivalry gained some momentum as the game winner would represent the Western Division in the SEC Championship Game. The game (called \"Miracle on Markham\") was won by Arkansas on a last second touchdown pass by Matt Jones.[259] In 2006, the Tigers snapped the SEC West champion Razorbacks' 10-game winning streak when they beat Arkansas in Little Rock, 31–26.[260] In 2007, Arkansas stunned top-ranked LSU in triple overtime, 50–48, giving them their first win in Baton Rouge since 1993, and their first victory over a top-ranked team since beating Texas in 1981, winning back the Golden Boot trophy (after 4 consecutive seasons in the hands of LSU) in the process.[261] In 2008, the Razorbacks defended the trophy, winning 31–30 on a last minute touchdown drive. As of 2023, LSU leads the series 42–23–2.[262] Arkansas and Missouri first met in 1906 in Columbia, Missouri, and played each other a total of five times prior to Missouri joining the SEC in 2012, and then becoming Arkansas' permanent cross-division rival in 2014. The annual meeting was dubbed the Battle Line Rivalry by the SEC. On November 23, 2015, a new rivalry trophy was unveiled for the annual game. Missouri leads the series 10–4 as of the conclusion of the 2022 season. The Razorbacks first played the Rebels in 1908. In addition to several occasional years of playing each other, the two teams played each other from 1940 to 1947 and 1952–62 on an annual basis. The Razorbacks and Rebels also met twice in the Sugar Bowl, played in New Orleans, in 1963 and 1970 (both won by Ole Miss). Since 1981, the two teams have played each other annually in football. In 2001, Arkansas and Ole Miss played a then-NCAA record seven-overtime game in Oxford, Mississippi; Arkansas won by a final score of 58–56. When Houston Nutt resigned in 2007 after ten years as Arkansas' head coach to take the same job at Ole Miss, it only added to and heightened the long-standing rivalry between the schools. Nutt was at Ole Miss for four years and went 2–2 versus Arkansas. Arkansas had played Ole Miss more total times than any other SEC opponent until Texas A&M joined the conference in 2012. Arkansas leads the series, 37–29–1, per its records, but only leads 36–30–1 per Ole Miss.[263][264] The Arkansas-Texas game has not been regularly played since Arkansas's departure from the Southwest Conference in 1991, and this has dulled the intensity of the rivalry. There were many classic games, including the result of the 1969 Game of the Century (also known as \"The Big Shootout\"), which eventually led to the Longhorns' 1969 national championship.[265] One of Arkansas' biggest victories over Texas came in 1981, when the Razorbacks defeated the No. 1 ranked Longhorns in Fayetteville, 42–11. Arkansas and Texas have played only six times since 1991, with the Razorbacks winning the 2000 Cotton Bowl, a 2003 game in Austin, and the 2014 Texas Bowl. The Longhorns won the 2004 meeting in Fayetteville and a game in Austin in 2008. However, these games have not served to reignite the once intense rivalry between the two schools. The teams played again in Fayetteville in 2021 (a return game for the 2008 contest in Austin), where the game ended with the Arkansas Razorbacks winning by a score of 40–21; this victory put them in the AP Poll for the first time in 5 years.[266] As of the end of the 2021 season, Texas leads the series 56–23.[267] Beginning in the 2024 season, Texas and Oklahoma will become members of the SEC. Arkansas and Texas are scheduled to play in Fayetteville for the 2024 season. Many Razorback fans are hopeful that an annual game versus the Longhorns will become a reality once more. The Razorbacks first played the Texas A&M Aggies in 1903. From 1934 to 1991, the two had played annually as Southwest Conference members. However, the series ceased in 1991 when Arkansas left the SWC to join the Southeastern Conference. Two of the biggest victories for Arkansas over A&M came in 1975 and 1986. Arkansas manhandled undefeated #2 Texas A&M 31–6 in Little Rock in 1975 to win a share of that year's SWC championship and earn the right to play in the 1976 Cotton Bowl Classic. In 1986, Arkansas again beat Texas A&M in Little Rock, this time 14–10, handing the #7 Aggies their only conference loss of the season. The series resumed in 2009 played at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, TX, a neutral field, with Arkansas winning 47–19.[268] The initial agreement between the two schools allowed the game to be played for at least 10 years, followed by 5 consecutive, 4-year rollover options, allowing the game to be played for a total of 30 consecutive seasons.[269][270][271] Following A&M's move to the SEC, the 2012 game was played at Kyle Field, and the 2013 game was played at Arkansas, and thereafter resumed at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. Beginning in the 2025 season, the series will move back to each team's home-field stadiums. Arkansas' 20–10 victory during the 2021 season broke a 9-game A&M win streak against Arkansas. The Aggies won the 2022 matchup 23–21. As of the end of the 2022 season, the Razorbacks lead the all-time series 42–34–3.[272] Records as of December 28, 2023[264] Every year, players are selected by several publications to be placed on their All-American team for that season. The NCAA officially recognizes five All-American lists which include AP (Associated Press), American Football Coaches Association (AFCA), Football Writers Association of America (FWAA), Sporting News (TSN), and the Walter Camp Football Foundation (WCFF). A consensus All-American is determined using a point system; three points if the player was selected for the first team, two points for the second team, and one point for the third team. Arkansas has had 58 All-Americans (21 consensus) in its history.[285][286][287] † Consensus All-American Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium (formerly Razorback Stadium) is the on-campus and primary home stadium for the Razorbacks located in Fayetteville, Arkansas. The Razorbacks began playing football at Razorback Stadium in 1938, where they beat Oklahoma A&M 27–7.[289] The stadium was dedicated to Donald W. Reynolds for the $20 million donation from the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation to help finance the major expansion in 2001, which raised the seating capacity from 51,000 to 76,000. The playing field was dedicated to former head coach and athletic director Frank Broyles in 2007 and is now called the Frank Broyles Field at Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium.[290] War Memorial Stadium is the secondary home stadium for the Razorbacks. War Memorial Stadium is located in Little Rock, Arkansas, with a seating capacity of 53,727. War Memorial Stadium used to host either two or three Razorback football games per season. Beginning in 2014, Arkansas will only play one home game per season in Little Rock. The Willard and Pat Walker Pavilion was built in 1998 and is the indoor practice facility for the Arkansas Razorbacks.[289] Arkansas has 15 inductees to the College Football Hall of Fame with ties to the school. Arkansas has five inductees to the Pro Football Hall of Fame as of 2020.[306] From 1992 to 2023, Arkansas played in the West Division of the SEC and played each opponent in the division each year along with several teams from the East Division. The SEC will expand the conference to 16 teams and will eliminate its two divisions in 2024, causing a new scheduling format for the Razorbacks to play against the other members of the conference.[312] Only the 2024 conference schedule was announced on June 14, 2023, while the conference still considers a new format for the future.[313] Announced non-conference schedules as of August 19, 2024.[314]",

The Yellow Jackets struggled with a pair of turnovers and the Commodores quarterback was responsible for five touchdowns (three passing, two rushing). Georgia Tech (7-6) was able to play well but their mistakes were just too much to overcome late in the game.

                "content": "Estimated read time: 3-4 minutes BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — Diego Pavia and Vanderbilt delivered another victory to end a surprising season. Pavia threw three touchdown passes and ran for two more scores and Vanderbilt secured its first winning season since 2013 with a 35-27 victory over Georgia Tech on Friday in the Birmingham Bowl. The Commodores (7-6) capped the year with another big game from Pavia, a New Mexico State transfer whose gritty play helped lead a huge turnaround from a 2-10 season. \"This is just a stepping stone of what we want to do here at Vanderbilt,\" Pavia said. \"We've got bigger dreams.\" Pavia accounted for three of his scores in a six-minute span starting late in the third quarter before Georgia Tech (7-6) rallied. A lightning delay with 7:17 left only pushed back the celebration of the Commodores' first bowl win since that 9-4 season 11 years ago. \"That was a tough fight and I knew it wasn't going to be easy and the weather delay added a layer that we had to overcome,\" Vandy coach Clark Lea said. Pavia, the game MVP, completed 13 of 21 passes for 160 yards and gained 84 yards on 17 rushes. He had a 7-yard touchdown pass to Quincy Skinner Jr. and a 6-yard scoring run in the fourth quarter. Afterward, he announced his plans to return to Vandy next season, with the caveat that Lea and staffers like Jerry Kill come back. Georgia Tech's Haynes King tried to bring his team back from a 35-13 deficit with a 9-yard touchdown pass to Jamal Haynes with 5:03 left and a 2-yarder to Bailey Stockton at the 1:30 mark. Both onside kick attempts failed. \"I thought the character of our team showed with the final seven minutes of the game, how they fought through adversity and continued to play until the end of the game,\" Georgia Tech coach Brent Key said. King was 25-of-33 passing for 204 yards with three touchdowns and an interception. Haynes carried 17 times for 136 yards and had five catches for 32 yards. The Commodores went ahead 21-13 on Pavia's 3-yard touchdown pass to Eli Stowers with 56 seconds left in the third quarter in a drive filled with fireworks. Key was flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct protesting a pass interference call on the drive. It came after a non-call on what he thought was a kick catch interference that had buried the Yellow Jackets at their 2. \"There was dialogue and we have to control what we can control as a football team,\" Key said. Then, Tech was flagged for defensive holding and both teams were penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct after a scuffle on Vandy's sideline. The Yellow Jackets also had a roughing the kicker call on the extra point. King then threw only his second interception of the season and CJ Taylor returned it 22 yards to the 11. Pavia was called for unsportsmanlike conduct after flipping the ball into the stands following a run but still produced a 3-yard touchdown to Eli Stowers. \"I don't know that there was a more perfect person to quarterback this team and to quarterback this program,\" Lea said. \"This is a chip on the shoulder program.\" Georgia Tech: Had eight penalties for 90 yards and two turnovers that both led to touchdowns. The Yellow Jackets had already lost two key players to the transfer portal, edge rusher Romello Heights (Texas Tech) and leading receiver Eric Singleton Jr. (Auburn) Vanderbilt: Staged a big turnaround in Lea's fourth season a year after going 0-8 in Southeastern Conference games last season. Lea retooled the staff and brought in players like Pavia, and it paid off. \"We've come a long way in 12 months,\" Lea said. Vandy's prospects for next season got brighter when a federal judge cleared the way for Pavia to return for another season, pending an NCAA appeal. Georgia Tech's King also can come back. ___ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here.

                "content": "The Syracuse Orange football team represents Syracuse University in the sport of American football. The Orange compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). Syracuse is the only Division I FBS school in New York to compete in one of the Power Four conferences. The Orange play their home games in the JMA Wireless Dome, referred to as the JMA Dome on the university's campus in Syracuse, New York.[5] The stadium is also known as \"The Loud House.\" Formed in 1889, the program has amassed over 740 wins and has achieved one consensus national championship in 1959, defeating the Texas Longhorns in that season's Cotton Bowl. Syracuse has had 2 undefeated seasons, 5 conference championships since 1991, and has produced a Heisman Trophy winner, over 60 first team All-Americans, 18 Academic All-Americans and over 240 NFL players.[6] Syracuse has had 18 members inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, 2nd-most in the ACC, including former players Ernie Davis, Tim Green, Don McPherson, Art Monk and former coaches Vic Hanson, Ben Schwartzwalder, and Dick MacPherson.[7] The Orange boast 8 inductees in the Pro Football Hall Of Fame, tied for the 4th-most of any school, including Jim Brown, Marvin Harrison, Larry Csonka, and Floyd Little.[8] The Orange have 28 bowl appearances, 10 of which are among the New Year's Six Bowls. Syracuse has finished in the Final Top 25 rankings 21 times in the national polls, and finished in either the AP or Coaches Polls a combined 35 times since 1952. Syracuse has appeared in over 200 AP Polls including 7 weeks at AP number one. Syracuse played its first football game on November 23, 1889,[9][10] and achieved its first success in the 1890s and 1900s. With the construction of \"state-of-the-art\" Archbold Stadium in 1907, Syracuse rose to national prominence under College Football Hall of Fame coach Frank \"Buck\" O'Neill. The 1915 squad garnered a Rose Bowl invitation that the school declined, having already played on the West Coast that season. In 1918, John Barsha (born Abraham Barshofsky) was co‐captain of the 1918 Walter Camp All‐America football team.[11] The 1920s had continued success with teams featuring two-time All American Doc Alexander and star end Vic Hanson. Vic Hanson was an American football player and coach, basketball player, and baseball player. A three-sport college athlete, he played football, basketball, and baseball at Syracuse in the 1920s, serving as team captain in all three sports. The Watertown, New York native was named a Basketball All-American three times—in 1925, 1926, and 1927—was named the Helms Foundation College Basketball Player of the Year and was a consensus selection to both 1925 and 1926 College Football All-America Teams. Hanson is one of only two individuals who are members (Amos Alonzo Stagg being the other) of both the Basketball Hall of Fame and the College Football Hall of Fame and the only one inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame, the College Basketball Hall of Fame and the College Football Hall of Fame. He later coached the team from 1930 to 1936. In the 1930s, Syracuse and nearby Cornell University were among the first collegiate football teams to include African-American players as starting backfield players. Wilmeth Sidat-Singh was an African-American basketball star player for DeWitt Clinton High School. He received an offer of a basketball scholarship from Syracuse University and enrolled in 1935. While playing an intramural football game, an assistant football coach noticed his talent and asked him to join the football team. Sidat-Singh starred for Syracuse, playing a position equivalent to modern-day quarterback. In that era, when games were played in Southern segregation states, African-American players from Northern schools were banned from the field. Because of his light complexion and name, Sidat-Singh was sometimes assumed to be a \"Hindu\" (as people from India were often called by Americans during this time). However. shortly before a game against Maryland, a black sportswriter, Sam Lacy wrote an article in the Baltimore Afro-American, revealing Sidat-Singh's true racial identity. Wilmeth Sidat-Singh was held out of the game and Syracuse lost that game 0–13. Olympic track athlete Marty Glickman, who played football for Syracuse, believed athletic director Lew Andreas was a bigot who occasionally used a disparaging term for Blacks; the 18-year-old Glickman thought Andreas should have stood up for Sidat-Singh (Glickman also faulted himself for not standing up for Sidat-Singh).[12] In a rematch the following year at Syracuse, Sidat-Singh led the Orange to a lopsided victory (53–0) over Maryland. In 2005, Syracuse University honored Wilmeth Sidat-Singh by retiring his basketball jersey number.[13] On Saturday, Nov. 9, 2013, the University of Maryland publicly apologized to surviving relatives from the Webb family at a ceremony during a football game with Syracuse University.[14] Ossie Solem coached at Syracuse from 1937 to 1945. During his tenure at Syracuse, he tutored a young assistant coach named Bud Wilkinson, who went on to lead the Oklahoma Sooners to win three national championships. The late 1930s and 1940s had a decline in fortunes that began to reverse when Ben Schwartzwalder took over as head coach in 1949.[15] Syracuse made its first bowl appearance in the 1953 Orange Bowl,[16] followed by appearances in the 1957 Cotton Bowl[17] and the 1959 Orange Bowl.[18] Jim Brown (a high school standout from Manhasset, New York),[19][20] considered to be one of the greatest running backs of all time, as well as one of the greatest players in NFL history,[21] was a consensus first-team All-American in 1956, finished fifth in the Heisman Trophy voting and set school records for highest season rush average (6.2) and most rushing touchdowns in a single game (6). In the Cotton Bowl, Brown rushed for 132 yards, scored three touchdowns, and kicked three extra points, but a blocked extra point after Syracuse's third touchdown was the difference as TCU won 28–27.[22] In 1959, Syracuse earned its first consensus national championship, finishing No. 1 in both the AP and Coaches' Polls, following an undefeated season (11–0) and Cotton Bowl Classic victory over No. 4 Texas. The team featured sophomore running back Ernie Davis of Elmira, New York, who went on to become the first African American to win the Heisman Trophy in 1961,[23] and All-American tackle Ron Luciano, who eventually become a prominent Major League Baseball umpire. Davis was slated to play for the Cleveland Browns in the same backfield as Jim Brown, but died of leukemia before being able to play professionally. Syracuse remained competitive through the 1960s with a series of All-American running backs, including Floyd Little and Larry Csonka (both inductees in the Pro Football Hall of Fame).[24][25] Schwartzwalder produced 22 straight years of non-losing football, took the Orange to seven bowls, won the Lambert-Meadowlands Trophy (to recognize the Eastern champion in Division I FBS) four times: 1952, 1956, 1959, 1966; and won the national championship in 1959. He developed some of the most impressive running backs the game has ever seen - Jim Brown, Ernie Davis, Jim Nance, Floyd Little and Larry Csonka. Orange teams outrushed opponents by more than 22,000 yards under Schwartzwalder. He retired as Syracuse's head coach after the 1973 season, which was Syracuse's third consecutive losing season.[26] Schwartzwalder left Syracuse with a 153–91–3 record.[27] In 1969, a group of nine African American student-athletes boycotted Syracuse University's football program to demand change and promote racial equality. Popularized erroneously in 1970 by the media as the “Syracuse 8,” the nine students behind the boycott were Gregory Allen, Richard Bulls, Dana Harrell, John Godbolt, John Lobon, Clarence “Bucky” McGill, A. Alif Muhammad (then known as Al Newton), Duane Walker, and Ron Womack.[28] The student athletes drafted a list of four demands, three of which were advocating for the betterment for all student athletes at the university, were access to the same academic tutoring as their white teammates; better medical care for all team members; starting assignments based on merit; and racially integrating the coaching staff, which had been all white since 1898.[29] Michigan assistant coach Frank Maloney was hired as Schwartzwalder's replacement.[30] Maloney's tenure at Syracuse was marked by inconsistency.[31] The fan base turned on him as the Orange failed to achieve the national status they had enjoyed under Schwartzwalder. Maloney's program was also limited by archaic facilities.[32] Archbold Stadium, Syracuse's home field since 1907, was in need of replacement.[32] Nonetheless, Maloney did recruit a number of future NFL stars such as Joe Morris and Pro Football Hall of Fame member Art Monk.[33] Maloney was the subject of criticism, not only from the fans and alumni, but also from the 1959 national championship team, members of which started a campaign calling for his ouster.[34] Ironically enough, this call from program alumni came during the 1979 season, Maloney's best at Syracuse, when the Orangemen qualified for the Independence Bowl, beating McNeese State. After coaching the Orangemen for seven seasons and presiding over the opening of a new stadium, the Carrier Dome (renamed in 2022 the JMA Wireless Dome), in 1980, Maloney resigned.[35] Dick MacPherson was hired as the head coach in 1981[36] and after several mediocre seasons, fans wanted MacPherson fired, coining the phrase, \"Sack Mac\".[37] However, the fans' opinion of Coach MacPherson changed when the program returned suddenly to national prominence in 1987 with an undefeated 11–0 regular season record.[38] The team featured Maxwell Award-winning quarterback Don McPherson and fullback Daryl Johnston.[39] The team missed an opportunity to play for the NCAA Division I-A national football championship, because both Oklahoma and Miami also finished undefeated that year and finished higher in the polls.[40] Instead, the team faced Southeastern Conference champion Auburn University in the Sugar Bowl.[41] The game ended in a 16–16 tie when Auburn kicked a late field goal rather than trying for a game-winning touchdown.[42] MacPherson left Syracuse after the 1990 season to accept the position of head coach for the NFL's New England Patriots.[43] McPherson is credited with building a strong recruiting pipeline in the northeast area.[44] Syracuse continued to experience success under MacPherson's successor, Paul Pasqualoni, previously the team's linebackers coach,[45] appearing in 11 bowl games (including three major bowls) and winning 9.[46] The team also captured or shared three Big East football championships during this period. Prominent players of the period included Donovan McNabb, Marvin Harrison, Dwight Freeney, Keith Bulluck, Rob Moore, Donovin Darius, Qadry Ismail, Kevin Johnson, Rob Konrad, Tebucky Jones, and Marvin Graves.[47][48] Rivalries shifted in the early 1990s as Penn State ended its series with Syracuse and joined the Big Ten.[49] Syracuse, meanwhile, joined the newly formed Big East football conference with traditional rival West Virginia University, and national power Miami.[50] In 2004, Miami and Virginia Tech left the Big East to join the Atlantic Coast Conference,[51] followed by Boston College in 2005,[52] threatening the stature of the Big East. Syracuse was originally invited to leave the Big East and join the ACC, but under pressure from the Governor of Virginia, the ACC decided to invite Virginia Tech to join the conference, instead.[53] Thus, Syracuse remained in the Big East. Syracuse's streak of winning seasons ended in 2002 when they went 4–8.[54] This was followed by consecutive 6–6 seasons.[55][56] Although they won a share of the Big East title in 2004 and competed in the Champs Sports Bowl,[57] the teams from 2002 to 2004 were considered mediocre by Syracuse standards. This prompted new athletic director Dr. Daryl Gross to fire Pasqualoni after 14 years at the helm.[58] In 2005, the university hired Greg Robinson, defensive coordinator for Texas, as head coach.[59] Robinson installed a new West Coast offense scheme, replacing the option run style of offense previously run by Pasqualoni, and new defensive schemes.[60] The 2005 season started on a high note as Syracuse nearly upset eventual Big East and Sugar Bowl champion West Virginia, forcing five turnovers in the 15–7 loss.[61] They followed it up with a 31–0 thrashing of Buffalo[62] and another near-upset, this time against #25 Virginia, falling 27–24 on a last-second field goal.[63] The squad lost its final eight games of the season. Syracuse finished the year 1–10, the worst on-field season in school history and won only 10 games with Robinson running the program.[64] Robinson's Orange improved to 4–8 in 2006[65] but fell to 2–10 in 2007.[66] The 2007 season included a road upset of number-18 Louisville.[67] When the struggles continued in 2008, Syracuse fired Robinson[68] following a 3–9 season[69] where the high point was a 24–23 upset of Notre Dame.[70] At the other end of the spectrum, in a game that exemplified the Robinson era, the Orange lost 55–13 to Penn State.[71] Robinson's .213 winning percentage on the field is the worst for a non-interim coach in school history. He has been criticized for abandoning the traditional northeast recruiting pipeline.[44] In 2015, Syracuse vacated all of its wins from 2005 and 2006 due to ineligible players, dropping Robinson's \"official\" winning percentage to .119. On December 12, 2008, Doug Marrone, a Bronx, New York native and former Orange player, was announced as the replacement for Robinson as head coach.[72][73][74] Marrone was the first Syracuse alumnus to serve as head football coach since Reaves H. Baysinger in 1948.[75] Reportedly, alumni such as Tim Green and Floyd Little wanted Marrone from the moment the previous coach Greg Robinson was fired, and when interviewed by Green, Marrone was found to have kept a folder of current high-school players in the Syracuse area to get a head start in recruiting.[76][77][78] Improvement throughout the program was noticed immediately, as the Orange, despite only a marginal improvement in their win–loss record, going 4–8 under Marrone for his first year,[79] played many much more closely, including a 28–7 loss at number-seven Penn State.[80] In 2010, the Orange finished the regular season with a winning record for the first time since the 2001 season at 7–5, including road wins against number-19 West Virginia and two-time defending conference champion Cincinnati.[81] The team earned its first bowl bid since 2004 and along with second-ranked Oregon and 10th-ranked Boise State, the five road wins were the best in 2010 of all FBS teams.[82] December 30, 2010, Syracuse defeated Kansas State in the inaugural Pinstripe Bowl at Yankee Stadium. The game was televised live on ESPN.[83] Two years later, the Orange defeated West Virginia in the 2012 Pinstripe Bowl.[84] On January 7, 2013, Marrone left Syracuse, accepting the head-coaching position of the NFL's Buffalo Bills.[85] The day after Marrone's departure, Syracuse promoted defensive coordinator Scott Shafer to head coach.[86] Coach Shafer's first season was marked by inconsistency from the team in spite of the bowl eligibility for the third time in four years. Syracuse capped off the season with a 21–17 victory over Minnesota in the 2013 Texas Bowl to finish the year 7–6.[87][88] The first season for the Orange in the ACC was 2013.[89] The 2014 season brought about a noticeable drop in quality. Syracuse finished the season a disappointing 3–9.[90] In 2015, after they started the season 3–0, the Orange collapsed, losing 8 of their final 9 games to finish the season 4–8,[91] and on November 23, 2015, it was announced that Shafer would be fired after the last game of the 2015 campaign.[92] After an extensive coaching search, Syracuse announced the hiring of Bowling Green head coach Dino Babers as the new Orange head football coach.[93] Babers was the first African-American head coach in school history.[94] Babers brought with him an exciting, up-tempo offense he employed both as a head coach and as an assistant coach.[95] In Babers' first season in charge, Syracuse started the year at 4–4, with the highlight of the first eight games being a 31–17 upset of number-17 Virginia Tech at home.[96] Syracuse kept the momentum from the upset going and beat rival Boston College on the road, 28–20.[97] However, they were blown out 54–0 in their next game by No. 3 Clemson.[98] In the final game of the season, Syracuse lost to ACC rival Pittsburgh by a score of 76–61.[99] The game was the highest scoring in FBS history with a combined score of 137.[100] Syracuse finished 4–8 for the second consecutive year.[101] In 2017, the Orange started 4–3, including a win over No. 2 Clemson,[102] but they lost their final five games to finish 4–8 for the third straight year.[103] In 2018, Syracuse earned its first bowl bid under Babers, going 10–3 with a bowl victory over West Virginia.[104] In 2022, Syracuse started 6–0, earning a No. 14 ranking in the AP and Coaches' Polls. However, the team squandered a 21–10 halftime lead to Clemson, falling 27–21. The Orange lost their next four games before finishing the season with a win at Boston College to end the year 7–5.[105] Syracuse earned a trip to the Pinstripe Bowl where it lost to Minnesota, 28–20.[106] After a 4–0 start to the 2023 season, Syracuse lost 6 of the next 7 games, leading to Babers' firing with one game remaining in the 2023 season.[107] On November 28, 2023, Brown was named the 31st head coach in program history.[108] His deep recruiting ties in South Jersey, one of Syracuse's primary recruiting grounds, were cited as a major reason for his hiring.[109] Less than a month later, Fran Brown signed Syracuse's best recruiting class in the \"modern era\" according to the Syracuse Post-Standard.[110] The class included several high-profile transfers, including five-star recruit Kyle McCord, the starting quarterback from the Ohio State Buckeyes.[111] The Brown era begun with a 38-22 win over Ohio, and he led the Orange to their first 9 win season since 2018. It included ranked wins over Georgia Tech, UNLV, and then beating then CFP ranked Miami.[112][113][114][115] McCord broke several of Syracuse's single-season passing records, including the single-season passing record against UConn, as well as leading FBS in passing yards in 2024.[116] Syracuse entered the AP, Coaches, and CFP rankings after the Miami game. On 27 December, Syracuse traveled to San Diego to play in the Holiday Bowl against Washington State.[117]. They won 52-35. Syracuse has been independent and affiliated with two conferences.[118] Syracuse finished their undefeated 1959 season with a 23–14 victory over the No. 4 Texas Longhorns in the Cotton Bowl, and were named the national champions by all major selectors, including the major wire-service: AP and Coaches' Poll.[119] For much of its history, Syracuse played as an independent, as did the majority of what are now labeled as Division I FBS football-playing schools located in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. During this time, Eastern Championships were named by independent third-party selectors and awarded of various trophies. The process of picking an Eastern Champion eventually came to be symbolized by the Lambert-Meadowlands Trophy awarded by the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority beginning in 1936. As a result, the Lambert-Meadowlands Trophy, voted on by a panel of sports writers in New York, became the de facto conference championship for those schools.[120] In 1991, the majority of football independents in the East (including Syracuse) aligned themselves together in the Big East Football Conference. The Big East first crowned an official champion in 1993. In 2013, Syracuse joined the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). † Co-champions There have been 31 head coaches at Syracuse.[121] Fran Brown became the most recent head coach in 2024. 1913–1915 1917–1919 1944–1945 The No. 44 at Syracuse is one of the most legendary numbers ever associated with a college football program. Like tailbacks at USC or quarterbacks at Purdue, the running back position at Syracuse has a rich tradition of greatness. Much of that greatness has revolved around one jersey number — 44. Syracuse University officially retired #44 on Saturday, November 12, 2005. Since 1954, 11 players have worn the number and three of the most famous #44s — Jim Brown, Ernie Davis, and Floyd Little — are in the College Football Hall of Fame. Jim Brown played at SU from 1954 to 1956. Brown earned numerous honors as Orange playing college football, basketball, track and field and lacrosse. In his senior year in 1956 Brown was a consensus first-team All-American and led the team to a Cotton Bowl. He finished fifth in the Heisman Trophy voting and set school records for highest season rush average (6.2), most rushing touchdowns in a single game (6), and an NCAA single-game record of 43 points.[122] After his successful college career, Brown went on to become one of the greatest football players of all time.[123] Jim Brown was an All Pro and a Pro Bowl invitee every season he was in the league, was recognized as the AP NFL Most Valuable Player three times, and won an NFL championship with the Browns in 1964. He led the league in rushing yards in eight out of his nine seasons, and by the time he retired, he had shattered most major rushing records. Brown's memorable professional career led to his induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971. His football accomplishments at Syracuse garnered him a berth in the College Football Hall of Fame. Jim Brown also earned a spot in the Lacrosse Hall of Fame, giving him a rare triple crown of sorts. Today, he is recognized as the greatest football player ever[124] by most professional football writers.[125] But Brown's legacy goes beyond sports. Brown was one of the NFL's earliest social issues activists along with a group of top African American athletes from different sporting disciplines such as Bill Russell, Muhammad Ali and Kareem Abdul Jabbar. In the 1960s, Brown co-founded the Black Economic Union to support the growth of black-owned businesses. In the 1980s he also started the Amer-I-Can program which mentors youth in both inner cities and prisons. Ernie Davis, the only Orange player to win the Heisman Trophy, played at Syracuse from 1959 to 1961, and went on to national fame in each of those three seasons, winning first-team All-American honors twice. Davis led the 1959 Syracuse team to a national championship, capping an 11–0 season with a 23–14 win over the Texas Longhorns in the 1960 Cotton Bowl Classic, where Davis was named Most Valuable Player. That same season, Elmira Star-Gazette sports writer Al Mallette coined the nickname for Davis, the \"Elmira Express\". During his Cotton Bowl visit to host city Dallas, Texas, Ernie and his black teammates found discrimination prevalent in the American South. Author Jocelyn Selim writes that at the banquet following the 1960 game, Davis was told he could only accept his award and then would be required to leave the segregated facility when the doors were opened to the public for a dance. Despite the racial issues, Davis became the first black athlete to be awarded the Heisman Trophy (the highest individual honor in collegiate football) and he also won the Walter Camp Memorial Trophy following his 1961 season at Syracuse University. President John F. Kennedy had followed Davis' career and requested to meet him while he was in New York to receive the trophy. Later in 1963, when Elmira chose February 3 to celebrate Davis' achievements, Kennedy sent a telegram, reading: Seldom has an athlete been more deserving of such a tribute. Your high standards of performance on the field and off the field, reflect the finest qualities of competition, sportsmanship and citizenship. The nation has bestowed upon you its highest awards for your athletic achievements. It's a privilege for me to address you tonight as an outstanding American, and as a worthy example of our youth. I salute you.[126] Davis was the number-one pick in the 1962 NFL draft. He was bound to go to the Cleveland Browns where he would be teammates with Jim Brown. Davis signed a three-year contract with the Browns in late December 1961. It was the most lucrative contract for an NFL rookie up to that time.[127] However, Davis' dream of pairing with Jim Brown took a tragic turn when Davis was diagnosed with leukemia. The disease was incurable and Davis died at age 23 at Cleveland Lakeside Hospital on May 18, 1963.[128] Following his death, the Browns retired his number 45 jersey. A motion picture biography, The Express: The Ernie Davis Story, directed by Gary Fleder and based on the non-fiction book The Elmira Express: the Story of Ernie Davis by Robert C. Gallagher, began production in April 2007[129] and was released on October 10, 2008. His commemorative statue now stands in front of the school named in his honor, Ernie Davis Academy. Another statue of Davis stands on the campus of Syracuse University, near the steps of Hendricks Chapel and the Shaw Quad where pre-game pep rallies are held. He was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in the fall of 1979. Floyd Little played for Syracuse from 1964 to 1966. He is the only three-time All-American running back to compete for the Syracuse University Orangemen. He finished 5th in Heisman Trophy voting in both 1965 and 1966. Floyd was the leading force behind teams that earned tickets to the Sugar Bowl in 1964 and the Gator Bowl in 1966 (teaming with another great tailback Larry Csonka in the latter). In addition to breaking the running records of Brown and Davis, Little became the greatest kick returner in Orange history. He led the country in all-purpose yardage, averaging 199 yards per game in 1965.[130] Floyd Little was the first ever first-round draft pick to sign with the American Football League's Denver Broncos. During his rookie year, Little led the NFL in punt returns with a 16.9-yard average. He led the NFL in combined yards in 1967 and 1968 and was the first ever Bronco to win a rushing title, leading the AFC in rushing in 1970 and the following year he became the first Bronco to eclipse 1,000 yards, gaining 1,133 to lead the NFL.[131] Little was Denver Broncos team captain all 9 seasons, including his rookie season and he was known as \"The Franchise\". Floyd Little retired as the NFL's 7th all-time leading rusher with 6,323 yards. He later was inducted both in the College and Pro Football Hall of Fame. To honor his achievements Denver Broncos retired his #44 jersey. Statues of Davis (second on campus), Brown and Little are at Syracuse University's Plaza 44, commemorating the number the running backs wore while playing football. No. 44 has become so associated with Syracuse that all university phone numbers begin with 44 and the university's ZIP code, 13244, was requested by university officials to remember those who wore 44 for the Orange. “Number 44 not only has come to represent greatness on the football field, it has become a part of the university's and the community's identity”.[130] The Syracuse University Marching Band (SUMB), also known as the \"Pride of the Orange\", is the collegiate marching band of Syracuse University. The SUMB performs at all home football games throughout the season, and also makes several local parades and other performances throughout the year. It is one of the largest student organizations at Syracuse University, consisting of approximately 200 members. Founded in 1901, it is one of the oldest collegiate bands in the nation. Over the course of almost 120 years, the \"Pride of the Orange\" has played a huge role in university history and has been a constant source of pride for the university.[132] The rivalry with fellow ACC conference member Pittsburgh began in 1916, and has been played annually since 1955. The Panthers and Orange were both Eastern football independents for most of their history but have shared the same football conference since 1991 when the Big East Football Conference was formed from Eastern football independents. Pitt is tied as the most played opponent for Syracuse and Syracuse is the third most played opponent for Pitt. Sharing membership in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) since 2013, the Panthers and Orange have played a total of 74 times. Pittsburgh leads the series 44–32–3 through the 2018 season.[135] Pittsburgh and Syracuse will play every season as part of an ACC scheduling agreement. Syracuse and West Virginia have played 60 times. Often, these games have had a bearing on which collegiate program was the best in the East. In much of the '80s and '90s, Syracuse and West Virginia made for one of the Big East's best head-to-head match-ups on a yearly basis. West Virginia then left the Big East for the Big 12 Conference in 2012.[136] The Ben Schwartzwalder Trophy goes to the winner of the West Virginia and Syracuse football game. The trophy was introduced in 1993 and is named after former WVU football player and Syracuse head coach Ben Schwartzwalder, who had died in March of that year.[137] The trophy weighs 55 pounds and was sculpted by Syracuse player Jimmy Ridlon. West Virginia won the first trophy game at Syracuse and has gone on to win 11.[138] Syracuse has won the trophy eight times and currently holds it.[139] Syracuse leads the series 34–27 with the last two games played in 2012 Pinstripe Bowl and 2018 Camping World Bowl.[140] Syracuse is currently on the 4 game winning streak. There are no future matchups scheduled. The \"heyday\" of the Syracuse Penn State rivalry took place during the 1950s and 1960s when the teams battled back and forth in a competitive and often controversial string of contests. Syracuse football was led by legendary coach Ben Schwartzwalder, and Penn State by Rip Engle from 1950 to 1966 and Joe Paterno from 1967 to 2011. From 1950 to 1970, Syracuse won 11 to Penn State's 10 games. Unfortunately conference realignment and scheduling disagreements have dampened the intensity of the rivalry between the teams in recent years. The teams first met on October 28, 1922, at the New York Polo Grounds battling to a scoreless[citation needed] tie kick-starting an East coast rivalry that has seen 71 total match-ups with the teams meeting almost every season from 1922 to 1990. The only exception was during the 1943 season, when Syracuse did not field team in light of World War II.[citation needed] From 1922 to 1940 Syracuse held a 10–4–4 advantage over the Nittany Lions, before Penn State would win 8 straight from 1941 to 1949. In the 1947 match-up, Penn State prevailed 40–0 in State College behind a staunch defense that held the Orange to (-47) total yards which is an NCAA record. (-107 rushing, 60 passing, in 49 plays)[141] From 1956 to 1966 the Orange regained command winning 8 out of 11. Since 1967, the Nittany Lions have dominated winning 24 of 27 match-ups including 16 straight from 1971 to 1986. In 1987, Dick MacPherson coached Syracuse to a 48–21 victory over the Nittany Lions in the JMA Wireless Dome. Syracuse won again the following year at Penn State, but lost the final two games before the suspension of the series in 1991.[142] Penn State leads the all-time series 43–23–5, and have won 5 straight. The most recent match-up was played at Metlife Stadium in East Rutherford, NJ; a 23–17 win for Penn State.[143] The teams are scheduled to play in State College in 2027 and in Syracuse in 2028.[144] For many years, Syracuse's main football rivals were the nearby Colgate Red Raiders. Colgate and Syracuse first played each other in football in 1891, with Colgate recording a 22–16 victory. The Red Raiders would go on the win 12 of the first 16 games in the series. Colgate's early dominance in the series quickly gave rise to the legend of the Hoodoo (a play on a corruption of the word Voodoo). The schools have played each other a total of 67 times, with the series tied at 31–31–5. By the late 1950s, Syracuse had established itself as a major power in Eastern college football, and the games became increasingly one-sided. Following the 1961 contest, Colgate terminated the series, in order to focus on playing smaller, peer institutions. Following the NCAA's I-A/I-AA split in 1978, the rivalry was intermittently renewed in the 1980s, with Syracuse comfortably winning all three games played in the decade. In 2010, the rivalry was renewed again after a 23-year absence, with Syracuse recording a 42–7 victory.[145][146] The series resumed again in 2016, when Syracuse hosted Colgate in a game played in the Carrier Dome,[147] which Syracuse won 33–7. Syracuse has won all of the meetings since then, and are next scheduled to play in 2025. Syracuse University adopted orange color as its official color in 1890. The color was selected after a vote by students, alumni, faculty, and trustees, who noted it was a strong, bright color not claimed by any other school. Syracuse University was the first school to adopt only one primary color. It was chosen to \"represent the golden apples of Hesperia, as well as the story of the sunrise and hope for a golden future.\"[148] The first uniforms of the Orange were classic white sweaters and dark pants. Syracuse football wore these from 1889 to 1919. Orange color was first worn in the 1920s. A blue number was stitched on the back of orange jerseys, and the dark pants were replaced with Khaki moleskin. Blue began to be generally recognized as a secondary color of Syracuse.[149] During its glory years beginning with the first bowl game appearance in 1952, Syracuse football used to wear white jerseys and orange pants at home at Archbold stadium. From 1952 to 1966, coach Ben Schwartzwalder, with his military background and always looking for an edge, thought white jerseys made his players look bigger, faster and stronger. During his first three seasons (1949–51) and in 1958, he also experimented with an all orange look to camouflage the football.[150] Blue jerseys were rarely seen during that era as Syracuse wore them only three times. The switch to blue and orange combination at home came in 1967. Since then, it was blue jersey and orange pants at home until the first three Frank Maloney seasons (1974–76) when the newly assigned coach wanted to move away from the Schwartzwalder era with orange jerseys and unusually designed white helmets, before bringing blue jerseys and orange helmets back for essentially the next 28 seasons. Syracuse started wearing white jerseys and orange jerseys (and pants) at home again in the 2000s. Three colors (orange, white and blue) have been used in several combinations throughout the years. Since the establishment of the team in 1890, Syracuse has appeared in 29 bowl games. Included in these games are 10 combined appearances in the \"New Year's Six\" bowl games (the Rose, Sugar, Cotton, Orange, Fiesta and Peach) and 1 Bowl Championship Series (BCS) game appearances. The New Year's Six represent six of the ten oldest bowl games played at the FBS level (missing the Sun, Gator, Citrus and Liberty bowls), continuing their original history of putting the very best teams in the country against each other. Syracuse's all-time bowl record is 17 wins, 11 losses and 1 tie (17–11–1). Syracuse has finished in the Final Top 25 rankings 21 times in the national polls, and finished in either the AP or Coaches Polls a combined 35 times since 1952. Syracuse has appeared in over 200 AP Polls including 7 weeks at AP No.1.[151] † AP Poll began selecting the nation's Top 20 teams in 1936. Only the Top 10 teams were recognized from 1962 to 1967. The AP Poll expanded back to the Top 20 teams in 1968. In 1989, it began recognizing the Top 25 teams. ‡ UPI/Coaches Poll began selecting its Top 20 teams on a weekly basis in 1950 before expanding to the nations's Top 25 teams in 1990. ^ College Football Playoff (CFP) committee began selecting the Top 25 teams in 2014. Syracuse University retired eight jersey numbers1 and hung them in the JMA Wireless Dome rafters.[152][153] 1Syracuse doesn't retire numbers, instead retiring individual players' jerseys by hanging their number in the JMA Dome.[152] 2 The complete list of players who wore number 44 (by chronological order): Gifford Zimmerman, Charles Roberts, Clarence Taylor, Don Baldwin, Richard Fishel, Henry Merz, Hamilton Watt, Francis Mullins, Stanley Stanislay, Benjamin DeYoung, Francis Mazejko, Richard Ransom, J. O'Brien, Robert Eberling, Jim Brown, Thomas Stephens, Ernie Davis, William Schoonover, Floyd Little, Richard Panczyszyn, Mandel Robinson, Glenn Moore, Michael Owens, Terry Richardson, and Rob Konrad. Jim Brown is named as the greatest player in college football history. ESPN unveiled college football's 150 greatest players of the first 150 years of history of college football. ESPN's top 150 players were determined by a blue-ribbon panel of current and former writers, broadcasters, administrators, sports information directors and ESPN personalities.[154][155] † Finalist Syracuse football players have earned All-America honors over 130 times since 1908. Among those selections, 20 have achieved Consensus All-American status. Of those consensus All-Americans, 9 are unanimous selections. Below is the list of first team All Americans named by major selectors. The best players of the decade and the team, which includes 29 players, was selected by Big East media members to celebrate the 10th year of Big East football.[156] † co-winner Syracuse football players in All-ACC teams since 2013. Syracuse is one of the most represented schools in the National Football Foundation's College Hall of Fame. The Orange have 18 enshrinees, second-most among ACC programs behind Pittsburgh (25). Syracuse has had 11 players and 7 former coaches inducted into the Hall of Fame.[157] Syracuse's legacy in the Pro Football Hall of Fame ranks among the finest of any college football program. The Orange boast eight inductees, tied for the eight-most of any school. Only Notre Dame (13), USC (13), Michigan (11), Ohio State (10), Miami (9), and Pittsburgh (9) have more representatives in the Pro Football Hall of Fame than Syracuse.[158] The National Football League 100th Anniversary All-Time Team was revealed in 2019 after being voted on by a panel consisting of media members, former players and league personnel. It honored the best players of the first 100 years of the National Football League (NFL). The team was chosen by a panel of 26 voters made up of coaches, team and front office executives, former players and members of the media between April and June 2018. Players were selected at each position group, and were voted in no order. There will be 10 quarterbacks, 12 running backs, 10 wide receivers, 5 tight ends, 7 tackles, 7 guards, 4 centers, 7 defensive ends, 7 defensive tackles, 6 outside linebackers, 6 middle/inside linebackers, 7 cornerbacks, 6 safeties, 2 kickers, 2 punters, 2 kick/punt returners, and 10 coaches.

Archbold, who donated $600,000 for the project. The Orange battled for victory inside the walls of Archbold Stadium from 1907 until 1978. Orange fans of the early 1900s were astonished by Archbold's unique design. The stadium's front entrance defined the character of Archbold, which consisted of an impressive cement arch and two epic towers, which extended high above the archway. In addition to providing the university and the fans with an aesthetically beautiful stadium, Archbold gave the Orange football team a distinct home field advantage for all 71 years of its existence. The Orange went 265–112–20 all-time at Archbold, and at times were nearly unbeatable. From 1915 to 1927, Syracuse achieved a remarkable home record of 61–10–6. Then, during the 11-year stretch from 1958 to 1968, the team in Orange won 47 and lost only 6 games played at Archbold Stadium.[169] Toward the end of the 1970s, Syracuse University was under pressure to improve its football facilities in order to remain a Division I-A football school. Archbold Stadium could not be expanded; earlier in the decade it had been reduced from 40,000 seats to 26,000 due to fire codes. Therefore, Syracuse University decided to build a new stadium on the site of Archbold, which, appropriately for Syracuse's often cold weather, was to have a domed Teflon-coated, fiberglass inflatable roof. While the JMA Wireless Dome was being built during the 1979 season, Syracuse played \"home\" games at three different locations—Giants Stadium, home of the NFL's New York Giants; Rich Stadium (now known as New Era Field), home of the NFL's Buffalo Bills; and Schoellkopf Field, home of the Cornell Big Red. The Syracuse Orange football team plays their games at the JMA Wireless Dome, referred to as the JMA Dome. The stadium is also known as \"The Loud House\", when it opened in September 1980, it was made clear just how loud it was inside; soon famous nickname was coined. It is the largest domed stadium of any college campus and the largest domed stadium in the Northeastern United States. The JMA Wireless Dome is used for several sports at the university and seats 49,250 for football.[1] The field was dedicated in 2009 to Ernie Davis, the first African American Heisman Trophy winner. The field now reads \"Ernie Davis Legends Field\" between the 45 yard lines on the home side. Davis's number forty-four was also placed along that yard line. The dedication took place at the Syracuse vs. West Virginia game October 10, 2009.[170] In May 2018, the university announced the first phase of a major renovation to the JMA Wireless Dome as the central portion of a larger campus update. The most significant changes were the replacement of the current air-supported roof with a fixed roof, two-thirds of which will be translucent, the installation of air conditioning and the largest centerhung videoboard in college sports.[171] The upgrade also included a new lighting and sound systems, Wi-Fi improvements, accessibility upgrades, improved restrooms, and new concession spaces.[172] The high-profile renovation project by Geiger Engineers - the same firm that was the structural engineer for the original stadium, was named a winner of NCSEA's 2021 Excellence in Structural Engineering Award for Forensic/Renovation/Retrofit/Rehabilitation Structures.[173] The school announced the next phase of its work to enhance, elevate and expand the stadium experience in April, 2022. This includes a complete replacement of benches with individual seats; a construction of a new publicly accessible event facility adjacent to the Dome; and an upgrade of the entire digital infrastructure, including latest 5G technology and wireless connectivity.[174] The renovation of both phases, estimated to cost $165 million, was completed in 2024. Syracuse will play the following ACC teams in 2025[175]: Announced schedules as of December 28, 2024.[176]",

The Orange played their home games at the JMA Wireless Dome, competing as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference. They were led by first-year head coach Fran Brown. The Orange were in their 123rd season overall and their twelfth as a member of the ACC.[1] On November 2, the Orange defeated Virginia Tech for their sixth win, securing bowl eligibility for the third season in a row. This is the first time the Orange have been bowl eligible for three consecutive seasons since the program played in five straight bowls from 1995 through 1999.[2] For the first time since 1998, Syracuse beat three AP top 25 teams (Miami (FL), UNLV, and Georgia Tech) in the same season.[3] In the regular season finale on November 30, the Orange defeated Miami to secure their ninth win, which is the most regular season wins for the program since the 2018 season and just the third time since 2000 (2001, 2018). Syracuse erased a 21-point first half deficit and won 42–38, which marked the largest comeback win in program history.[3][4] Dino Babers, who coached the team from 2016 to 2023, was fired from his role as head coach at Syracuse on November 19, 2023, one game before the end of the 2023 regular season. Babers had just two winning seasons during his eight years at Syracuse.[7] He moved to become the offensive coordinator at the University of Arizona. First year offensive coordinator Jason Beck took the same position at New Mexico.[8] First year defensive coordinator Rocky Long was hired as a defensive analyst at Fort Lewis College.[9] On November 28, 2023, Fran Brown was named the 31st head coach of the Orange.[10][11] Brown was named #1 national recruiter by 247Sports in 2023,[12] and previously served as the defensive backs coach at Georgia, Baylor, Rutgers, and Temple. His deep recruiting ties in South Jersey, one of Syracuse's primary recruiting grounds, were cited as a major reason for his hiring.[13][14] Jeff Nixon and Elijah Robinson were hired as OC and DC, respectively.[15][16] The Syracuse Orange were ranked 16th nationally with 77% of their production returning, according to data compiled by ESPN’s Bill Connelly.[17] Over the course of the off-season, Syracuse lost over 35 players to graduation and to the transfer portal (29). No Orange players were selected in the 2024 NFL draft,[18] but three former Orange were selected in the first round of the 2024 CFL Draft.[19] Syracuse's 2024 class consisted of 25 signees.[20] The class was ranked eighth in the ACC and 37th best overall by the 247Sports Composite.[21] Sources: 2024 Overall class rankings Syracuse had 29 departures with an average 247Sports rating of 85, and welcomed 23 transfer players with an average rating of 87.17.

He was chosen as part of XXL magazine's 2015 annual Freshman Class.[4] He was also the founder of the hip hop collective OGG, through which he discovered then-unknown producer OG Parker. In 2016, he released an extended play titled For Scott… as a tribute to his biggest influence, American rapper Kid Cudi, whose real name is Scott Mescudi. Benedict Chiajulam Ihesiba Jr. was born on April 23, 1992, in College Park, Georgia. He grew up with friends in a band named Dr. Doctor, in which he was a guitarist and singer.[5] Maco cited Black Sabbath, Kid Cudi, and Currensy as major influences.[6][7][8] Ihesiba was seriously injured in a traffic collision on July 28, 2016. He suffered multiple skull fractures, cracked vertebrae, a broken orbital, and heart palpitations, and nearly lost his right eye.[9][10] In 2019, he was diagnosed with the flesh-eating disease necrotizing fasciitis, causing an improperly treated minor skin rash to leave much of his facial skin disfigured.[11][12] Ihesiba struggled with depression from his battle with the condition,[13] and on December 12, 2024, he was hospitalized after a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.[14][15] He spent the next two weeks in a coma before dying from his injuries on December 27, 2024.[16][17]",

                "content": "Rapper OG Maco has died two weeks after suffering a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He was 32. Maco, best known for his song “U Guessed It,” passed away surrounded by his family Thursday night at a Los Angeles hospital, according to TMZ. Maco’s family later confirmed his death in a post shared on the rapper’s Instagram account Friday. “With heavy hearts, we share the heartbreaking news of the passing of our beloved Ben, known to the world as OG Maco,” the family’s statement began. “His life was a testament to resilience, creativity, and boundless love. Through his music, passion, and unwavering spirit, he touched so many lives and left a lasting impact.” “While we grieve this immense loss, we also celebrate the extraordinary life he lived – one that will continue to inspire and uplift others,” the family added. “Maco’s influence, both as an artist and as a person, will remain forever etched in our hearts.” “For those who wish to offer condolences, share memories, or connect with the family, please reach out through this account. Your support means more than words can express.” The statement concluded, “To all of Maco’s fans, friends, and supporters: thank you for standing by him throughout his journey. Today, we celebrate a life that was extraordinary in every way.” Born Benedict Chiajulam Ihesiba Jr., OG Maco had been hospitalized since sustaining a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head on Dec. 12. Sources claimed Maco was in a coma as of Thursday and recently took a turn for the worse, which sent him into critical condition. The hospital staff were reportedly unable to revive him. Before his passing, doctors supposedly struggled to obtain a proper brain scan as they attempted to flush out toxins from Maco’s body. Maco was found by police at his Los Angeles area home with a firearm close by after a neighbor called 911 and reported hearing a gunshot go off in the star’s house on the morning of Dec. 12, according to TMZ. He was unresponsive, rushed to a local hospital and immediately went into surgery. The rapper’s family reportedly flew to LA to be by his side. Three days after being admitted to the hospital, Maco’s family released a statement on the rapper’s Instagram. “We want to inform OG Maco’s fans, friends, and supporters that he is currently in critical but stable condition,” they wrote at the time. “He is receiving the best possible care, and we are staying hopeful as he continues to fight.” They continued, “We thank you for your understanding, support, and continued prayers during this difficult time.” Before his hospitalization, rumors had circulated online that Maco was dead. The Atlanta-born rapper broke onto the music scene in 2014 after becoming one of hip-hop label Quality Control’s first signees and releasing his debut single “U Guessed It.” A remix featuring 2 Chainz reached the 90 spot on the Billboard Hot 100. Maco was included in XXL’s 2015 Freshman Class, the outlet’s annual list of 10 up-and-coming rappers who they feel are defining the new wave of hip-hop. Just three years later, however, he announced he was retiring from music. Not long after, he revealed he had been diagnosed with a “skin-eating disease.” But by 2019, he was on the mend. Maco ended up continuing to make music, releasing a self-titled album last year and a new single, “Shawty,” featuring Fnx in November. The Post has reached out to reps for OG Maco.

                "content": "Rapper OG Maco has died at the age of 32, his family announced Friday on Instagram, reportedly two weeks after suffering a self-inflicted gunshot wound. \"With heavy hearts, we share the heartbreaking news of the passing of our beloved Ben, known to the world as OG Maco,\" the post read about the rapper, whose legal name was Benedict Chiajulam Ihesiba Jr. \"His life was a testament to resilience, creativity, and boundless love. Through his music, passion, and unwavering spirit, he touched so many lives and left a lasting impact.\" OG Maco's family did not reveal his official cause of death but told fans on December 16 that the Georgia native was \"in critical, but stable condition\" while receiving \"the best possible care.\" TMZ reported on December 12 that OG Maco had been taken to the hospital in Los Angeles with a gunshot wound to the head. Newsweek reached out to representatives for OG Maco via email for comment. In March 2019, OG Maco revealed on Instagram that he had developed necrotizing fasciitis after being \"improperly treated for a minor rash.\" Necrotizing fasciitis, commonly known as flesh-eating disease, is a rare but severe bacterial infection that rapidly destroys soft tissue. \"I was improperly treated for a minor rash and ended up with a skin-eating disease for the last few months,\" he shared in a since-deleted Instagram post of his face, according to Complex. \"This is the best it's looked. I hope it gives someone hope. I've been going through this alone 90 percent of the time, without the support of the person I love, without most of my 'friends,' without anything but my own strength and God.\" According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the disease is caused by Group A Streptococcus bacteria, which are contagious. While most cases occur randomly, less severe group A strep infections can develop into this serious condition. Early symptoms of necrotizing fasciitis include a red, warm, or swollen area of skin that spreads quickly, severe pain beyond the affected area, and fever. As the condition progresses, symptoms may include changes in skin color, ulcers, blisters, black spots, pus or oozing from the infected area, fatigue, dizziness, and diarrhea or nausea. Immediate medical attention is crucial, as the infection can lead to organ failure, sepsis, shock, and even death. Treatment typically involves prompt surgical removal of infected tissue and intravenous antibiotics. People with weakened immune systems or chronic health conditions, such as diabetes or cancer, are at higher risk, especially if they have open wounds or recent injuries. A post shared by DJ Akademiks (@akademiks) OG Maco also told fans in an Instagram video that he became depressed after receiving his necrotizing fasciitis diagnosis. \"Everybody I really thought would be here, who I really thought I could depend on, weren't there,\" he said. \"I was scared; I didn't know what was going to happen; I didn't know if I was going to lose my entire face...I almost did. My friend told me the other day that maybe I should share what I've been going through instead of beating myself down for feeling how I felt about it, which I wanted to die a bunch of days.\" In 2015, Doja Cat briefly signed with OG Maco's label, OGG (Originality Gains Greatness). They later collaborated on the song \"Monster,\" featured on Maco's 2017 mixtape Children of The Rage. \"I made another rock song,\" OG Maco tweeted at the time of the song's release, according to XXL. \"It's not rap at all but the blogs gonna say it is because I'm supposed to be a 'rapper.'\" \"Monster is one of those records that's built for arenas. It's made for you to enjoy that song with 20,000 other people with some lighters and cellphones. It's real rock star s***,\" he said in a 2015 interview with DJBooth. Newsweek reached out to representatives for Doja Cat via email for comment. No, OG Maco's record label, OGG, no longer exists. Born in College Park, Georgia, Maco began recording music in high school and cofounded OGG. He gained fame in 2014 with his mixtape Live Life and the hit single \"U Guessed It,\" which peaked at No. 90 on the Billboard Hot 100 after a remix with 2 Chainz. Later that year, OG Maco signed with Quality Control Music, which became an imprint of Capitol Music Group/Motown in 2015. DJ Paul of Three 6 Mafia commented on OG Maco's Instagram post on Friday: \"F–k bro!!!! Man i had a batch ready for u! Take it back to us sleeping in the studio on the floor n s–t in Noho 2015 trying to get them records right! U always had them hooks for any beat i had!

                "title": "Mike Brown (basketball, born 1970) - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Michael Burton Brown[1] (born March 5, 1970) is an American basketball coach who most recently served as the head coach for the Sacramento Kings of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Brown was previously the head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Los Angeles Lakers, and most recently an assistant coach for the Golden State Warriors. He is also the head coach of the Nigerian national team. Brown began coaching the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2005. The team reached the 2007 NBA Finals, where they were swept by the San Antonio Spurs. Brown was honored as NBA Coach of the Year for leading the Cavaliers to a team-record and league-best 66 wins in 2009. The Cavaliers won 61 games, again a league-best, in 2010. However, after the Cavaliers lost to the Boston Celtics in the 2010 Eastern Conference semifinals, Brown was fired. Brown succeeded Phil Jackson as the head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers in 2011 before being dismissed five games into the 2012–13 season. He returned to the Cavaliers in 2013, but was fired after one season. Brown then joined the Golden State Warriors as associate head coach in 2016; the team went on to defeat the Cavaliers in the 2017 and 2018 NBA Finals, and the Boston Celtics in the 2022 NBA Finals. He departed from the Warriors in 2022 to become the head coach of the Sacramento Kings. In his first year as head coach, Brown led the Kings to their first playoff appearance in 17 years, snapping the longest playoff drought in NBA history. For his efforts, Brown became the first-ever unanimous NBA Coach of the Year award winner and was named to the NBCA Coach of the Year award in 2023. Brown was born on March 5, 1970, in Columbus, Ohio,[2] to a father who served in the US Air Force.[3] He moved with his family to military bases where his father was stationed and spent time in the United States, Japan and Germany during his childhood.[3][4] Brown graduated in 1988 from Würzburg American High School in Würzburg, Germany, where he excelled in basketball and football.[5] After studying and playing basketball for two years at Mesa Community College, Brown went on to the University of San Diego, where he played two seasons of college basketball for the San Diego Toreros and graduated in 1992 with a Bachelor of Business Administration degree.[6] Brown began his NBA career in 1992 with the Denver Nuggets, where he was a video coordinator and scout for five seasons. In 1997, Brown moved to Washington for two seasons, working as an assistant coach under Bernie Bickerstaff.[7] In 2000, Brown was hired by Gregg Popovich as an assistant coach with the San Antonio Spurs.[8] He also was the head coach for the Spurs' summer league teams in Boston and Salt Lake City.[9] The Spurs won an NBA championship in 2003 while Brown was on their coaching staff.[10] In 2003, Brown was hired as associate head coach under Rick Carlisle with the Indiana Pacers.[8] He helped lead Indiana to consecutive playoff appearances, including a trip to the Eastern Conference finals in 2004.[11] Brown followed Ron Artest into the stands and was instrumental in getting him back to the locker room during the massive brawl between the Pacers, Detroit Pistons, and Pistons fans at the Palace at Auburn Hills on November 19, 2004.[12] Brown remained with the Pacers for two seasons.[10] In June 2005, Brown replaced Brendan Malone as head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers. It was his first NBA head coaching position. Brown became the second-youngest coach in the league (trailing only Lawrence Frank).[6] When Brown arrived in Cleveland, the Cavs had missed the playoffs in emerging superstar LeBron James's first two NBA seasons and had not made the playoffs since 1998. Under Brown, they won 50 games, made the 2005–06 playoffs, and won their first-round series.[13] On June 2, 2007, Brown's Cavaliers defeated the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference finals and advanced to the NBA Finals for the first time in franchise history.[14] However, they were swept in four games by his former team, the San Antonio Spurs.[15] On February 1, 2008, Brown was named the Eastern Conference Coach of the Month for January 2008.[16] In 2009, Brown was named coach of the Eastern Conference All-Star team.[17] On April 20, 2009, Brown was named NBA Coach of the Year after guiding the Cavaliers to a league-high[18] and franchise-best 66–16 record.[17] The Cavs won a league-high 61 games in the 2009–10 season.[19] However, the team was eliminated by the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference semifinals on May 13, 2010. With this loss, the Cavaliers became the first team in NBA history to win 60 games in back-to-back seasons without advancing to the NBA Finals.[20] Brown was fired on May 24, 2010, due to the owner Dan Gilbert wanting to lure LeBron James back to Cleveland.[21][22] Under Brown's leadership, the Cavs made it past the first round of the NBA playoffs for five consecutive seasons.[23] On May 25, 2011, Brown agreed to succeed Phil Jackson as head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers. He reportedly agreed to a three-year deal with a team option to renew his contract for a fourth year.[24] On May 31, 2011, he was officially named the Lakers' new head coach.[25] The 2011–12 season was shortened to 66 games by the lockout that season, and the Lakers were eliminated in the second round of the playoffs.[26] Before the 2012–13 season, Brown decided that the Lakers would use a version of the Princeton offense.[27] Shortly afterward, the Lakers acquired All-Stars Steve Nash and Dwight Howard, giving them a starting lineup of five former All-Stars with a combined 33 All-Star game appearances (the other former All-Stars were Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, and Metta World Peace, respectively).[28] Although immediately considered top title contenders, the Lakers struggled to adjust to the changes in both system and personnel and were winless in eight preseason games.[29] The team's travails continued into the start of the regular season, with the team losing four of its first five games.[30] Nash had played just 1+1⁄2 games due to injury, Howard was playing but recovering from back surgery, and Bryant had been playing with an injured foot and was unable to practice. On November 9, 2012, Brown was fired.[31] The Lakers felt an urgency to win given their aging stars, Howard's pending free agency, and owner Jerry Buss's deteriorating health.[31][32] Brown's dismissal after five games was the third-fastest coaching change in NBA history.[33] On April 24, 2013, Brown was rehired by the Cavaliers, replacing Byron Scott as head coach.[34] Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert said that firing Brown the first time was a \"mistake\".[35] For the first time as a head coach, Brown's team posted a losing record over an 82-game season as his team was marred by injuries and reported infighting in the locker room.[36] On May 12, 2014, he was fired by Gilbert a second time.[37] On July 6, 2016, the Golden State Warriors hired Brown as an assistant coach; he replaced Luke Walton, who departed for a head coaching position with the Los Angeles Lakers.[38] Brown served as acting head coach during periods in which head coach Steve Kerr was unable to do so due to chronic back pain. Brown led the Warriors to a 12–0 record in the 2016–17 NBA playoffs while Kerr was absent;[39] the Warriors went on to win the championship in five games that year, defeating the Cleveland Cavaliers.[40] The Warriors finished the playoffs with a 16–1 record, the best postseason winning percentage in NBA history.[41] The Warriors went back to the Finals in 2018 and defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Finals for the second straight year. During these two finals he faced off against LeBron James, whom he had coached for five years in Cleveland.[40] On May 9, 2022, he was the Warriors' acting head coach for Game 4 of the Western Conference semifinals against the Memphis Grizzlies after Kerr tested positive for COVID-19. The team won the game to take a 3–1 lead in the series.[42] The Warriors made it to the 2022 NBA Finals where they defeated the Boston Celtics in six games to give Brown his fourth NBA championship as an assistant coach and third championship with the Warriors overall. On May 9, 2022, Brown was named the head coach of the Sacramento Kings.[43][44] In his inaugural season, he coached the Kings to a 48–34 record and the team's first playoff appearance since 2006. He was subsequently named NBA Coach of the Year for the 2022–23 season, receiving 100 votes and becoming the first coach in history to win the award by a unanimous vote.[45][46] On December 27, 2024, the Kings fired Brown.[47][48] The previous day, Sacramento fell at home to the Detroit Pistons despite holding a ten-point lead with under three minutes remaining in regulation, as Jaden Ivey converted on a four-point play in the final seconds for a 114–113 Detroit victory.[49] On February 5, 2020, Brown was announced as the new head coach of Nigeria's men's national basketball team.[50][51] Brown's brother Anthony Brown played in the NFL.[52] Media related to Mike Brown (basketball, born 1970) at Wikimedia Commons # denotes interim head coach # denotes interim head coach # denotes interim head coach",

On Friday, ESPN's Shams Charania first reported that the Kings were moving on from head coach Mike Brown less than 24 hours after the Kings' 114-113 home loss to the Detroit Pistons. Sacramento has had a tough start to the season as they're in the middle of a 5-game losing streak and sit at 13-16 overall, including a 6-12 record at home. But Brown is coming off two straight winning season including a Coach of the Year performance (his second) in the 2022-23 season, his first with the Kings. That year also marked the end of a 16-season NBA Playoffs drought. Here's everything you need to know about the Kings' decision to fire Brown. Although it's early in the season, the Kings' disastrous start to the 2024-25 season left ownership searching for answers, especially of late. Sacramento started out the season consistently staying above -.500 until mid-November. The Kings fell to 9-12 on Dec. 1, and lost six out of their last 10 games. Currently, Sacramento is 13-18 and 12th in the Western Conference. According to various reports, Sacramento's home record may be a big reason. Say what you want about Vivek, he just ate 30 plus million to try and right the ship.Mike Brown may in fact be the unnecessary scapegoat, but you don’t lose games like that at home with these expectations and survive.You knew it was coming, and you pretty much knew if they… Sacramento lost 114-113 to the Pistons the night before Brown was fired. As Detriot trailed by three, Jaden Ivey hit a three-pointer and was fouled by Kings guard De'Aaron Fox. Ivey hit the free throw to give Detroit the win, capping off a 19-point rally in the second half. After the game, Brown appeared to call out Fox postgame, albeit not by name: Mike Brown got himself fired after he threw De'Aaron Fox under the bus after the loss last night. pic.twitter.com/FJOZPko6DL On Friday, this video of Brown and Fox made the rounds on social media and had many speculating this was the two saying goodbye, which was apparently taken shortly before Brown's firing: This moment between Kings head coach Mike Brown and De'Aaron Fox at today's practice will certainly be dissected and analyzed. pic.twitter.com/x6dYwZ1zf8 Nuggets coach Michael Malone, who had his first head coaching opportunity in Sacramento but was fired early in his second season, shredded the Kings for the decision. \"I'm not surprised that Mike Brown got fired, because I got fired by the same person,\" Malone told reporters, adding, \"No class.\" The Kings opened the season with +3500 odds to win the NBA Championship. But with stars like Fox, DeMar DeRozan and Domantas Sabonis, the Kings seemingly had a shot to at least make it to the playoffs. Brown led the Kings to the first-round of the playoffs for the first time since 2006 in the 2022-23 season. Sacramento surprisingly went up 2-0 in the series against Golden State, but ultimately lost in seven games. Sacramento is no stranger to cycling through coaches. Since Rick Adelman was the head coach from 1998-2006, there have been zero Kings coaches who have lasted longer than three seasons. Sacramento has hired 10 coaches since 2006. The timing of Brown's firing is particularly interesting, given that the head coach signed a multiyear extension with the Kings in June. Brown's contract extension paid him $8.5 million annually through the 2026-27 season, making it a 3-year, $25.5 million deal that can be worth up to $30 million if incentives are hit. Brown's original 4-year contract with the Kings was slated to expire after the 2024-25 season. It sounds like the Kings fired Brown on Friday after he led the team through a full practice, and as it was set to board a plane to Los Angeles. The Sacramento Kings just fired Mike Brown right before the team boarded a flight to LA. He just ran a full practice and spent 15 minutes talking to the media.Just bad man. Bad bad bad. Brown even went through media availability shortly before his firing: Again, just minutes ago we spoke with Mike Brown for 15 minutes. Part of what he talked about was handling the pressure as the head coach of an underperforming team.Here was his answer minutes before being fired: pic.twitter.com/LvcZmUmeIN Per Charania, current Kings assistant Doug Christie and former Sacramento guard will serve as the interim head coach for the rest of the season.

                "content": "On August 9, 2014, 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis.[2] Brown was accompanied by his 22-year-old male friend Dorian Johnson.[3] Wilson, a white male Ferguson police officer, said that an altercation ensued when Brown attacked him in his police vehicle for control of Wilson's service pistol. The struggle continued until the pistol fired.[4] Johnson said that Wilson initiated a confrontation by grabbing Brown by the neck through Wilson's patrol car window, threatening him and then shooting at him.[5] At this point, both Wilson and Johnson state that Brown and Johnson fled, with Wilson pursuing Brown shortly thereafter. Wilson stated that Brown stopped and charged him after a short pursuit. Johnson contradicted this account, stating that Brown turned around with his hands raised after Wilson shot at his back. According to Johnson, Wilson then shot Brown multiple times until Brown fell to the ground. In the entire altercation, Wilson fired a total of twelve bullets, including twice during the struggle in the car.[6] Brown was struck six times, all in the front of his body.[7][8][9] This event ignited unrest in Ferguson. Witnesses to the shooting claimed Brown had his hands up in surrender or said \"don't shoot\", so protesters later used the slogan \"Hands up, don't shoot\".[10] A subsequent FBI investigation said that there was no evidence that Brown had done so.[11] Peaceful protests and violent riots continued for more than a week in Ferguson; police later established a nightly curfew. The response of area police agencies in dealing with the protests was strongly criticized by both the media and politicians. Concerns were raised over insensitivity, tactics, and a militarized response. A grand jury was called and given evidence from Robert McCulloch, the St. Louis County Prosecutor. On November 24, 2014, McCulloch announced the St. Louis County grand jury had decided not to indict Wilson.[12] In March 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice reported the conclusion of its own investigation and cleared Wilson of civil rights violations in the shooting. It claimed that Wilson's account was \"corroborated by bruising on Wilson's jaw and scratches on his neck, the presence of Brown's DNA on Wilson's collar, shirt and pants, and Wilson's DNA on Brown's palm\", and claimed that witnesses who corroborated the officer's account were credible.[13][14] The U.S. Department of Justice concluded that Wilson shot Brown in self-defense.[15][16] In 2020, St. Louis County prosecutor Wesley Bell spent five months reviewing the case with an eye to charge Wilson with either manslaughter or murder. In July, Bell announced Wilson would not be charged.[17] Michael Orlandus Darrion Brown[18] (May 20, 1996[19] – August 9, 2014) graduated from Normandy High School in St. Louis County eight days before his death, completing an alternative education program.[20] At the time of his death, he was 18 years old, 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 meters) tall, and weighed 292 pounds (132 kilograms).[9] He was an amateur rap musician who posted his songs on the popular music-sharing site SoundCloud under the handle \"Big'Mike.\"[21] He was two days from starting a training program for heating and air conditioning repair at Vatterott College technical school.[22] Darren Dean Wilson[23] (born May 14, 1986, in Fort Worth, Texas)[24] is 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) tall and at the time weighed about 210 lb (95 kg).[25][26] Wilson's first police job was in the town of Jennings, Missouri, where he began working in 2009.[26][27] With respect to this job, Wilson said to The New Yorker in 2015, \"I'd never been in an area where there was that much poverty.\"[27] The police force in Jennings was shut down by the town's city council in March 2011.[26] In October 2011, Wilson began working for the Ferguson Police Department.[28] In February 2013, Wilson won a commendation from the Ferguson Police Department after he apprehended a suspect who was later charged with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and resisting arrest.[28] Surveillance video which was publicly released in the 2017 documentary film Stranger Fruit shows Michael Brown walking into Ferguson Market and Liquor at 1:13 a.m., ten-and-a-half hours before he entered the store for the final time. The footage shows Brown handing a young clerk a brown package, believed by the filmmaker to be marijuana, and then receiving an unpurchased package of cigarillos from the store. After the video was rediscovered and made public in 2017, some, including Brown's family, said they believed Brown had left the package there for safekeeping and later returned to retrieve it. The store owner disputed this through an attorney who dismissed claims that the store traded him \"cigarillos for pot.\" The lawyer claimed \"[t]he reason he [Brown] gave it back is he was walking out the door with unpaid merchandise and they [the staff] wanted it back.\"[29] The store's attorney said the video had been in the hands of Brown's family and law enforcement since the initial investigation, and said the video had been edited to remove the portion where the store clerk returned Brown's package to him.[30] Following this, on March 13, 2017, unedited footage from the store was released by the St. Louis County prosecutor to try to settle questions.[31] At 11:47 a.m., Officer Wilson responded to a call about a baby with breathing problems and drove to Glenark Drive in Ferguson, east of Canfield Drive.[32] About three minutes later and several blocks away, Brown was recorded on camera stealing a box of Swisher Sweets cigars and forcefully shoving a Ferguson Market clerk. At 11:53, a police dispatcher reported \"stealing in progress\" at the Ferguson Market and described the suspect as a black male wearing a white T-shirt running toward QuikTrip. The suspect was reported as having stolen a box of Swisher cigars.[32] Brown and his friend, Dorian Johnson, left the market at about 11:54 a.m.[33] At 11:57, the dispatch described the suspect as wearing a red St. Louis Cardinals hat, a white T-shirt, yellow socks, and khaki shorts, and that he was accompanied by another male.[32] Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said that the incident with Brown stealing cigars had \"nothing to do\" with why Brown was stopped by Wilson prior to the shooting, and that the reason Brown and Johnson were stopped was because \"they were walking down the middle of the street, blocking traffic.\"[34] At 12:00 p.m., Wilson reported he was back in service and radioed units 25 and 22 to ask if they needed his assistance in searching for the suspects.[32] Seven seconds later, an unidentified officer said the suspects had disappeared.[32] Wilson called for backup at 12:02, saying \"[Unit] 21. Put me on Canfield with two. And send me another car.\"[32] Initial reports of what happened next differed widely among sources and witnesses, particularly with regard to whether Brown was moving towards Wilson when the shots were fired. At noon on August 9, Wilson drove up to Brown and Johnson as they were walking in the middle of Canfield Drive and ordered them to move off the street. Wilson continued driving past the two men, but then backed up and stopped close to them.[35][9][36][37] A struggle took place between Brown and Wilson after Brown reached through the window of Wilson's police SUV, a Chevrolet Tahoe.[38] Wilson was armed with a SIG Sauer P229[39] pistol, which was fired twice during the struggle from inside the vehicle, with one bullet hitting Brown's right hand.[38][39] Brown and Johnson fled and Johnson hid behind a car.[40] Wilson got out of the vehicle and pursued Brown.[41] At some point, Wilson fired his pistol again, while facing Brown, and hit him with at least six shots, all in the front of his body.[9] Brown was unarmed and died on the street.[38][42] Less than 90 seconds passed from the time Wilson encountered Brown to the time of Brown's death.[43][44] An unidentified officer arrived on the scene and, 73 seconds after Wilson's call, asked where the second suspect was. Thirty-one seconds later, a supervisor was requested by Unit 25. At 12:07 p.m., an officer on scene radioed to dispatch for more units.[32] Also at 12:07, the St. Louis County police were notified and county officers began arriving on scene at around 12:15 p.m. The St. Louis County detectives were notified at 12:43 p.m. and arrived about 1:30 p.m., with the forensic investigator arriving at about 2:30 p.m.[45] Police dispatched 12 units to the scene by 1:00 p.m. with another 12, including two canine units, by 2:00 p.m. Gunshots were recorded in Ferguson police logs at 2:11 p.m., and by the ambulance dispatch again at 2:14 p.m., which led to the response of 20 more units from eight different municipal forces in the next 20 minutes. As the situation deteriorated, the police commanders had investigators seek cover and detectives assisted in crowd control. At 2:45, four canine units arrived on scene, and the SWAT team arrived at 3:20 p.m.[46] The medical examiner began his examination of Brown at approximately 3:30 p.m. and concluded about half an hour later, with Brown's body being cleared to be taken to the morgue.[46][47] At 4:37 p.m., Brown's body was signed in at the morgue by workers.[46] Michael Brown was fatally shot by Officer Wilson at about 12:02 p.m. The Ferguson Police Department was on the scene within minutes, as were crowds of residents, some expressing hostility toward the police. Paramedics covered the body with sheets. About 20 minutes after the shooting, the Ferguson police chief turned over the homicide investigation to the St. Louis County Police Department (SLCPD). The arrival of SLCPD detectives took about 70 minutes, as they were occupied with another crime scene 37 minutes away. On arrival at 1:30 p.m., they put up privacy screens around the body. Their investigation was slowed due to safety concerns regarding the sound of gunfire in the area and some hostile members of the crowd encroaching on the crime scene. An investigator from the St. Louis County Medical Examiner's office arrived at 2:30 p.m. Brown's body was removed at 4:00 p.m.[48] Local residents criticized authorities for leaving Brown's body in the street for four hours in an action seen as demeaning and disrespectful.[46] On August 11, 2014, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) opened a civil rights investigation into the incident.[49] A spokeswoman for the FBI's St. Louis field office said the decision to open an investigation was not motivated by the protests and riots which had ensued.[50] Forty FBI agents went door-to-door looking for potential witnesses who may have had information about the shooting.[51] Additionally, attorneys from the Civil Rights Division and from the United States Attorney's Office were participating in the investigation.[52] On March 4, 2015, the federal investigation cleared Wilson of civil rights violations in the shooting. The investigation concluded there was no evidence upon which prosecutors could rely to disprove Wilson's asserted belief that he feared for his safety, that witnesses who contradicted Wilson were not credible, that forensic evidence and credible witnesses corroborated Wilson's account, and that the facts did not support the filing of criminal charges against Wilson.[14][53][54] Credible witnesses did not support accounts that Brown had his hands up in surrender. He was not shot in the back. Forensic evidence showed he was moving toward Wilson. Numerous witnesses were found to have given accounts of actions they were unable to see from their vantage points, or to be recounting others' accounts.[14][53][54] A new St. Louis County prosecutor, Wesley Bell, spent five months in 2020 reviewing the case with an eye to charging Wilson with either manslaughter or murder.[55][56] In July, Bell announced he would not charge Wilson with any crime;[57] Bell said he didn't \"have the evidence to ethically bring a charge against Darren Wilson.\"[58] The grand jury was made up of members who had been impaneled in May 2014 for a regularly scheduled term, to hear all cases put forward by the prosecuting attorney's office. There were three black jury members (one man and two women) and nine white jury members (six men and three women), an ethnic breakdown that roughly reflects the racial makeup of St. Louis County,[59] which is about 30% black, and 70% white.[60] On August 20, 2014, the grand jury started hearing evidence in the case State of Missouri v. Darren Wilson, in order to decide whether a crime was committed and if there was probable cause to believe Wilson committed it.[61] There was intense interest focused on the grand jury. Robert P. McCulloch, the elected prosecuting attorney for St. Louis County, was in charge of the prosecution but did not participate in the direct handling of the grand jury hearing.[62][63][64] It was handled by two Assistant Prosecuting Attorneys of McCulloch's office: Kathi Alizadeh and Sheila Whirley.[63] McCulloch announced an unusual process: the grand jury would hear all the evidence, the proceedings would be transcribed, and the materials would be made public if the grand jury did not indict.[65] The grand jury took 25 days, over the span of three months, to hear more than 5,000 pages of testimony from 60 witnesses and then deliberate on whether or not to indict Wilson.[65][66] Most grand juries complete their work in a matter of days.[65] The grand jury was not sequestered during the process.[67] On the night of November 24, Prosecutor McCulloch reported in a 20-minute press conference that the grand jury had reached a decision in the case and would not indict Wilson.[68] Following his announcement, McCulloch released thousands of pages of grand jury documents, with materials published on the internet for public perusal.[69] The documents include transcripts of the proceedings, expert statements, and the testimony of some witnesses.[70] On December 8, more witness interviews and more than 50 brief audio recordings between the police dispatchers and responding police officers were released.[71] On December 13, a third release included the transcripts of witness interviews, including one with Dorian Johnson.[72] A video of the two-hour interview of Johnson by FBI and county police was withheld.[73][74] Robert P. McCulloch was the main focus of much of the criticism throughout the process and well into its aftermath. Attorney Raul Reyes characterized McCulloch as not being impartial, as his father was a police officer killed in an incident with a black suspect and other members of his family served with the St. Louis Police Department.[75] A petition calling for McCulloch to recuse himself gained 70,000 signatures.[76][77][78][79] Governor Jay Nixon declined to remove McCulloch and said doing so would potentially jeopardize the prosecution.[80] McCulloch dismissed the claims of bias, and later said he regretted not speaking publicly about his background at the time.[63][81] Legal analysts raised concerns over McCulloch's unorthodox approach, saying this process could have influenced the grand jury to decide against indictment and that they were given too much material to assess.[82][83] The analysts highlighted the significant differences between a typical grand jury proceeding in Missouri and how Wilson's case was handled.[41] Evidence presented to the grand jury showed that the shooting scene extended approximately 184 feet (56 m) along Canfield Drive, near where it intersects Copper Creek Court. The two-lane street runs east to west, and has sidewalks and curbs on both sides. Immediately prior to the incident, Brown was walking eastbound on Canfield and Officer Wilson was driving westbound. Evidence at the scene was generally clustered around Wilson's patrol SUV on the western side of the scene and near Brown's body, which was in the eastern part of the area. The 30-foot (9.1 m) western area included Wilson's SUV, which was angled slightly toward the right curb with its left-rear corner on the center line. Evidence included two bracelets,[note 1] a baseball cap, and two .40 caliber spent casings. One of these casings was found at the western edge of the scene and the other was located near the rear driver's side of the police vehicle. There were two groups of red stains near the driver's side of the vehicle and a left sandal was also located in the vicinity. The right sandal was approximately 44 feet (13 m) east of the western area. The eastern area, which was approximately 124 feet (38 m) east of the western area, was about 29 feet (8.8 m) wide. Brown's body was situated along the center-line of the road with his head oriented in a westerly direction. The distance from the driver's door of Wilson's SUV to Brown's head was about 153 feet (47 m). Two groups of red stains were located at the extreme eastern edge of the scene, with the furthest under 22 feet (6.7 m) from Brown's feet. One apparent projectile was found near the body. There were ten spent .40-caliber casings scattered on the south side of the road near Brown's body. The distribution of the casings, combined with most of the casings being east of the body, was consistent with Officer Wilson moving backward while firing.[1] Blood spatter approximately 25 feet (7.6 m) behind Brown's body suggested Brown was moving toward Wilson when Brown was killed.[41][86] Brown's DNA was found on Wilson's gun. His DNA was also found on the left thigh of Officer Wilson's pants and on the inside driver's door handle of Wilson's police SUV,[39] the result of Brown's spilled blood staining Wilson's pants and the door handle.[87] Wilson's DNA was found on Brown's left palm but was not found under Brown's fingernails or on his right hand.[39] Michael Graham, the St. Louis medical examiner, said blood was found on Wilson's gun and inside the car, and tissue from Brown was found on the exterior of the driver's side of Wilson's vehicle; this evidence was consistent with a struggle at that location. According to Judy Melinek, a San Francisco pathologist who commented on the case as an expert, the official autopsy, which said Brown's hand had foreign matter consistent with a gun discharge on it, supported Wilson's testimony that Brown was reaching for the weapon,[88] or indicated the gun was inches away from Brown's hand when it went off.[39] According to the detective who performed tests on the gun, he had to decide whether to perform a DNA test or dust for fingerprints, because only one test can be performed without affecting the other.[39] He found the gun stored in an unsealed envelope, contrary to the customary evidence-handling protocol.[89] Documents released after the grand jury proceedings show Wilson washed blood from his hands and checked his own gun into an evidence bag, both actions described by media outlets as unorthodox procedures for such a case.[90][91] Three autopsies[note 2] were performed on Brown's body, with all three noting Brown had been shot at least six times, including twice in the head. He received no shots in his back.[92] The county autopsy report described gunshot entry and exit wounds to Brown's right arm coming from both the front (ventral, palms facing forward) and the back (dorsal, palms facing backward).[93] The local medical examiner autopsy report released to state prosecutors said Brown was shot in the front part of his body. When Mary Case, the St. Louis County medical examiner, was asked to provide details, she declined to comment further, citing the ongoing investigation into Brown's death.[94][95] The official county autopsy was later leaked to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.[96][88] The narrative report of investigation from the office of the medical examiner of St. Louis agreed with Wilson's testimony.[88] It noted Brown had sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the head, torso, and right arm, as well as a single gunshot wound to the inside of his right hand near his thumb and palm; it also noted Brown's body had abrasions to the right side of his face and on the back of his left hand.[88] The autopsy noted the absence of stippling, powder burns around a wound that indicate a shot was fired at a relatively short range. Michael Graham notes gunshot wounds within an inch of the body do not always cause stippling. Microscopic examination of tissue taken from Brown's thumb wound detected the presence of a foreign material consistent with the material which is ejected from a gun while firing.[88] The gunshot wound to the top of Brown's head was consistent with Brown either falling forward or being in a lunging position; the shot was instantly fatal.[88] A toxicology test performed by a St. Louis University laboratory revealed the presence of THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, in Brown's blood and urine. This indicated he used marijuana within a few hours of his death, but not whether he was impaired when he died.[88] At the request of Brown's family, on August 17 a preliminary autopsy was conducted by Michael Baden, a former chief medical examiner for the City of New York (1978–1979). This autopsy was limited because the previous county autopsy had washed, embalmed, and taken evidence off the body.[97][98][99][100] According to Baden's report, Brown was shot six times into his front: four of the bullets entered his right arm, one entered his right eye on a downward trajectory, and one entered the top of his skull.[9] All of the rounds were fired from a distance of at least one foot.[101] One of the shots shattered Brown's right eye, traveled through his face, then exited his jaw and reentered his collarbone. Brown could have survived the first bullet wounds, but the bullet that entered the top of his head resulted in a fatal injury.[102][9] Baden had no access to the clothing of the victim, and had not yet seen the x-rays showing where bullets were in the body. He could not determine if any gunpowder residue was on that clothing. Baden concluded there was too little information to forensically reconstruct the shooting.[9] At least two commentators noted the results of both autopsies contradicted some aspects of some eyewitness accounts, which had reported Wilson shot Brown in the back[9] and that Wilson shot Brown while holding Brown's neck.[103] In later analysis, Baden reclassified one of Brown's chest wounds as an entry wound.[104] Baden was assisted by Shawn Parcells, who did not have a degree or credentials in medicine or pathology.[105][106] Thomas Young, former Jackson County Medical Examiner, said Parcells gave out forensic pathology opinions when Parcells is not qualified to do so.[105] Mary Case, who performed the initial autopsy, said Parcells' involvement could cause issues with the second autopsy.[107] Parcells said all he did was assist Baden.[107] In 2021, Parcells was convicted of six criminal charges relating to autopsies he illegally performed.[108] Attorney General Eric Holder ordered a third autopsy of Brown's body.[109][110] Its findings matched the other two autopsies, but its detailed findings were initially withheld from the public due to the ongoing investigation.[94][111] The federal autopsy report was among a group of documents released by the St. Louis County Prosecutor's Office on December 8, two weeks after the grand jury chose not to indict Wilson.[111][112] On August 27, CNN released an audio recording purported to contain the sounds of the shooting.[113][114] The recording was made by an anonymous third-party who happened to be recording a video-text message at the time of the incident.[115] Glide, a video messaging service, confirmed the audio had been recorded on their site at 12:02 p.m. on the day of the shooting.[116][117] The twelve-second recording contains a series of shots, a short pause, and then a second series of shots.[115] Forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg says he heard six shots, a pause, and then four additional shots. Ginsberg said, \"I was very concerned about that pause ... because it's not just the number of gunshots, it's how they're fired. And that has a huge relevance on how this case might finally end up.\"[114] CNN's law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes noted most accounts of the shooting say there was a single shot earlier in the incident near the vehicle that is not audible in the recording.[118][119] The recording was also analyzed by SST, Inc., a company specializing in gunfire locator technology. That analysis found the sound of ten gunshots and seven gunshot echoes within seven seconds, with a three-second pause after the sixth shot. The company's analysis also said all ten rounds were fired from within a radius of 3 feet (0.91 m), indicating the shooter was not moving.[120] The Washington Post said there were unorthodox forensic practices shown in the published testimony of Officer Wilson and other law enforcement officials. The article said Wilson washed blood off of his hands without photographing them first. It also said Wilson submitted his gun to evidence by himself, and that initial interviews of Wilson were conducted with other personnel present and were not taped. It described Wilson's face injuries after the shooting as photographed by a local detective at the Fraternal Order of Police building, instead of at Ferguson Police headquarters. An investigator with the St. Louis County Medical Examiner's office testified he decided not to take measurements at the crime scene nor did he photograph the scene, instead relying on photographs taken by the St. Louis County Police Department.[121] Multiple witnesses saw part or all of the event and have given interviews to the media, testified to the grand jury, and were interviewed by the U.S. Department of Justice. The witness accounts were conflicting on various points.[94][122][123][124][125][126] David A. Klinger, a criminologist at the University of Missouri–St. Louis, said eyewitness testimony often differs from witness to witness, a phenomenon commonly known as the Rashomon effect.[127] An Associated Press review of the grand jury found numerous problems in the witness testimony, including statements that were \"inconsistent, fabricated, or provably wrong\". Several of the witnesses admitted changing their testimony to fit released evidence, or other witness statements.[128] Prosecuting attorney Robert McCulloch said, \"I thought it was important to present anybody and everybody, and some that were, yes, clearly not telling the truth, no question about it.\"[129] The Department of Justice investigation into the shooting determined witnesses who corroborated Wilson's account were credible while those who contradicted Wilson's account were not. The witnesses that claimed Brown was surrendering or did not move toward Wilson were not credible; the report said their claims were inconsistent with the physical evidence, other witness statements, and in some cases prior statements from the same witness. No witness statements that pointed to Wilson's guilt were determined to be credible. Twenty-four statements were determined to lack any credibility, while eight which were found credible corroborated Wilson's account. Nine did not completely contradict nor corroborate Wilson's account.[53] Several witnesses reported fear of reprisals from the community for providing evidence that corroborated Wilson's account.[53] Officer Wilson gave his account of the incident in an interview with a detective on August 10, and in testimony before the grand jury in September. Wilson said he had just left a call involving a sick person when he heard on his radio that there was a theft in progress at a local convenience store. Wilson heard the description of the suspects and soon after observed two black males walking down the middle of the street. Wilson pulled up to them and told the two to walk on the sidewalk, and Johnson replied, \"we're almost to our destination\". As they passed Wilson's patrol SUV window, Brown said \"fuck what you have to say\".[130] Wilson then backed up about ten feet to where they were[note 3] and attempted to open his door. After backing up, Wilson told the two to \"come here\", and Brown told him in reply, \"what the fuck are you gonna do\". Wilson shut the door and Brown approached him and he opened the door again \"trying to push him back\", while telling him to get back. Brown \"started swinging and punching at me from outside the vehicle\", and Brown had his body against the door. Wilson said the first strike from Brown was a \"glancing blow\", and at that point he was trying to get Brown's arms out of his face. This was when Brown turned to his left and handed Johnson several packs of the stolen cigarillos he had been holding.[130] Wilson then grabbed Brown's right arm trying to get control, but Brown hit him in the face. Wilson said he \"felt like a 5-year-old holding onto Hulk Hogan\" while he attempted to restrain Brown when he reached through his police car window.[25] Wilson said it \"jarred\" him back and he yelled at Brown numerous times to stop and get back. Wilson said he thought about using his mace and his baton, but he was unable to reach either of them. He then drew his weapon and pointed it at Brown and told him to stop or he would shoot him, while ordering him to the ground.[130] According to Wilson, Brown then said \"you're too much of a fucking pussy to shoot me\" and grabbed for his gun and twisted it, pointing it at him, into his hip area. Wilson placed his left hand against Brown's hand and his other hand on the gun and pushed forward with both his arms. The gun was somewhat lined up with Brown, and Wilson pulled the trigger twice, but the weapon failed to discharge. On the next try, the gun fired and Brown then attempted to hit him multiple times inside his vehicle. Wilson shot at Brown again, but missed, and Brown took off running east, while Wilson exited his vehicle and radioed for backup. Wilson followed Brown, yelling for him to stop and get on the ground, but he kept running. Brown eventually stopped and turned and made a \"grunting noise\" and started running at him with his right hand under his shirt in his waistband. Brown ignored Wilson's commands to stop and get on the ground, so Wilson fired multiple shots at him, paused, and yelled at him to get on the ground again, but Brown was still charging at him and had not slowed down. Wilson then fired another set of shots, but Brown was still running at him. When Brown was about eight to ten feet away, Wilson fired more shots, with one of those hitting Brown in the head, which brought him down with his hand still in his waistband. Wilson said two patrol cars showed up approximately fifteen to twenty seconds after the final shot. When his supervisor arrived, he was sent to the police station.[130] Wilson told detectives Brown had reached his right hand into his waistband and that the hand still appeared to be in the waistband after Brown was shot. The medical investigator at the scene of the shooting did not take any photographs and testified to the grand jury that Brown's left hand was under his dead body, near the waistband, and the right hand was extended outwards.[131] On November 26, Wilson gave his first public interview about the shooting to ABC News' George Stephanopoulos.[132] Numerous witness accounts were consistent with Wilson's account and also agreed with the physical evidence at hand. Many witnesses corroborated that Wilson acted in self-defense during the event. A number of the witnesses who corroborated Wilson's account of events expressed fear and apprehension in testifying, saying they had been harassed or threatened by individuals from the Ferguson community.[13]: pp.27–34 The following are a sample of the witnesses whose accounts aligned with Wilson's testimony. Witness 102 was a 27-year-old biracial male. He said he saw Wilson chase Brown until Brown abruptly turned around. Brown did not put his hands up in surrender but made some type of movement similar to pulling his pants up or a shoulder shrug and then made a full charge at Wilson. Witness 102 thought Wilson's life was threatened and he only fired shots when Brown was coming toward him.[13]: pp.27–28 After the shooting, Witness 102 remained in the neighborhood for a short period of time, and corrected a couple of people who claimed Wilson \"stood over [Brown] and shot while [he was] on the ground\". In response, Witness 102 said Wilson shot Brown because Brown came back toward Wilson. Witness 102 \"kept thinking\" Wilson's shots were \"missing\" Brown because Brown kept moving.[13]: p.28 Witness 102 did not stay in the neighborhood for long, and left the area shortly afterward because he felt uncomfortable. According to the witness, \"crowds of people had begun to gather, wrongly claiming the police shot Brown for no reason and that he had his hands up in surrender.” Two black women approached Witness 102, mobile phones set to record, asking him to recount what he had witnessed. Witness 102 responded that they would not like what he had to say. The women responded with racial slurs, calling him names like 'white motherfucker'.\"[13]: p.28 Witness 103, a 58-year-old black male, testified that from his parked truck he saw \"Brown punching Wilson at least three times in the facial area, through the open driver's window of the SUV... Wilson and Brown [had] hold of each other's shirts, but Brown was 'getting in a couple of blows [on Wilson]'.\"[13]: p.29 Wilson was leaning back toward the passenger seat with his forearm up, in an effort to block the blows. Then Witness 103 heard a gunshot and Brown took off running. Wilson exited the SUV, appeared to be using his shoulder microphone to call into his radio, and chased Brown with his gun held low ... Brown came to a stop near a car, put his hand down on the car, and turned around to face Wilson. Brown's hands were then down at his sides. Witness 103 did not see Brown's hands up. Wanting to leave, Witness 103 began to turn his car around in the opposite direction that Brown had been running when he heard additional shots. Witness 103 turned to his right, and saw Brown \"moving fast\" toward Wilson. Witness 103 then drove away.\"[13]: p.29 Witness 104, a 26-year-old biracial female, witnessed the end of the altercation from a minivan: [Witness 104] saw Brown run from the SUV, followed by Wilson, who \"hopped\" out of the SUV and ran after him while yelling \"stop, stop, stop\". Wilson did not fire his gun as Brown ran from him. Brown then turned around and \"for a second\" began to raise his hands as though he may have considered surrendering, but then quickly \"balled up in fists\" in a running position and \"charged\" at Wilson. Witness 104 described it as a \"tackle run\", explaining Brown \"wasn't going to stop\". Wilson fired his gun only as Brown charged at him, backing up as Brown came toward him. Witness 104 explained there were three separate volleys of shots. Each time, Brown ran toward Wilson, Wilson fired, Brown paused, Wilson stopped firing, and then Brown charged again. The pattern continued until Brown fell to the ground, \"smashing\" his face upon impact. Wilson did not fire while Brown momentarily had his hands up. Witness 104 explained it took some time for Wilson to fire, adding that she \"would have fired sooner\". Wilson did not go near Brown's body after Brown fell to his death.[13]: p.30 Witness 108, a 74-year-old black male, told detectives the police officer was \"in the right\" and \"did what he had to do\", and that statements made by people in the apartment complex about Brown surrendering were inaccurate. Witness 108 later told investigators he \"would have fucking shot that boy, too\", and mimicked the aggressive stance Brown made while charging Wilson. He explained Wilson told Brown to \"stop\" or \"get down\" at least ten times, but instead Brown \"charged\" at Wilson. Witness 108 also told detectives there were other witnesses on Canfield Drive who saw what he saw.[13]: p.32 Witness 109, a 53-year-old black male, said he decided to come forward after seeing Dorian Johnson \"lie\" about the events on television.[13]: p.32 He said when Wilson asked the two boys to get out of the street, Brown responded something to the effect of \"Fuck the police.\" Afterward, Wilson got out of his car and Brown hit him in the face. Witness 109 said he saw Wilson reach for his taser but dropped it and then grabbed a gun, after which Brown grabbed for Wilson's gun. According to 109, at one point Brown ran away from Wilson, but turned around and charged toward the officer. He said Wilson fired in self-defense, and did not appear to be shooting to kill at first.[13]: p.33 Witness 113, a 31-year-old black female, made statements that corroborated Wilson's account. She said she was afraid of the \"neighborhood backlash\" that might come from her testimony, and feared offering an account contrary to the narrative reported by the media that Brown held his hands up in surrender.[13]: pp.33–34 She also told investigators she thought Wilson's life was in danger. Witness 136 was in his apartment using a video chat application on his mobile phone while the shooting occurred. After hearing the first few shots, he recorded the remainder of his chat on his phone and turned it over to the FBI. The recording is about 12 seconds long and captured a total of 10 gunshots. The gunshots begin after the first four seconds. The recording captured six gunshots in two seconds. After a three-second pause, a seventh gunshot is heard. A pause of less than one second gave way to the final three-shot volley within two seconds. The recording was not time-stamped. As detailed below, this recording is consistent with several credible witness accounts as well as Wilson's account, that he fired several volleys of shots, briefly pausing between each one.[13]: pp.24–25 Several witnesses who originally testified against Wilson were also interviewed by the prosecution. They admitted to lying under oath as to the truthfulness of their testimony.[133][134] At least one witness took an account from a newspaper; this witness was later discredited by investigators during the process.[134] Witness 22, who originally claimed she saw Wilson kill Brown in cold blood, admitted she lied to investigators and never saw the incident at all. She said she was just passing along information which her boyfriend told her he saw.[133][135][136] The court transcript reads: Prosecution: You gave two statements, were both of those statements true? Witness 22: No. I just felt like I want to be part of something... I didn't see what I told the FBI what [sic] I saw. Prosecutors also played the grand jury a 10-minute police interview with a man who claimed to have witnessed the shooting. They then played a phone call in which that man admitted he actually had not seen the incident at all.[135] Another witness insisted another officer was with Wilson at the time of the shooting. By all other accounts, Wilson was the only officer present when he shot Brown. This witness described having a clear view of what transpired despite there being a building between the witness' location and where the incident took place.[135] Witness 35 said Brown was \"on his knees\" when Wilson shot him in the head. Under questioning, his testimony fell apart, and he admitted fabricating it.[135] Prosecution: What you are saying you saw isn't forensically possible based on the evidence. Are you telling us that the only thing that's true about all of your statements before this is that you saw that police officer shoot him at point blank range? Witness 35: Yes.[135] Another witness described Brown on his hands and knees pleading for his life. After a prosecutor confronted the witness and told them what they had seen was not forensically possible based on the evidence, the witness later asked to leave.[135] Another witness—number 37—testified that, during a confrontation at Wilson's vehicle, Wilson shot Brown point blank in the chest—but Brown did not fall over and was not clearly bleeding as he ran away. This witness gave several different accounts of how many shots were fired. While he was further pressed for answers as to the truthfulness of his statements, he instead posed questions in return, refusing to elaborate on his statements. Prosecution: You told three different stories in the time we've been here today. So I want to know which one is really your memory or did you see this at all? Witness 37: If none of my stuff is making any sense, like why do y'all keep contacting me?[135] Johnson, a friend of Brown, who was with him that day, gave his account of the incident to media outlets in August. In media interviews, Johnson said Wilson pulled up beside them and said, \"Get the fuck on the sidewalk.\"[137][138][139] The young men replied they were \"not but a minute away from [their] destination, and [they] would shortly be out of the street\".[139][note 4] Wilson drove forward without saying anything further and abruptly backed up, positioning his vehicle crosswise in their path. Wilson then allegedly tried to open his door aggressively and the door ricocheted off Brown and Johnson's bodies and closed back on Wilson.[40] Wilson, still in his vehicle, purportedly grabbed Brown around his neck using his left hand[13] through the open window, and Brown tried to pull away, but Wilson is said to have continued to pull Brown toward him \"like tug of war\".[125][142] Johnson noted that Brown had the upper hand over Wilson owing to his position relative to the seated Wilson, his size advantage and because Wilson was only grabbing him with one hand.[13] Johnson said Brown \"did not reach for the officer's weapon at all\", and was attempting to get free, when Wilson drew his weapon and said, \"I'll shoot you\" or \"I'm going to shoot\", and fired his weapon hitting Brown.[138][143][144][145][146] Following the initial gunshot, Brown freed himself, and the two are said to have fled. Wilson exited the vehicle, and allegedly fired several rounds at the fleeing Brown, hitting him once in the back.[40][139] Johnson said Brown then turned around with his hands raised and said, \"I don't have a gun. Stop shooting!\" Wilson is said to have then shot Brown several more times, killing him.[40][147] In his testimony in September to the grand jury, Johnson said he and Brown had walked to a convenience store to buy cigarillos, but Brown instead reached over the counter and took them and shoved a clerk on his way out the door.[148] Johnson testified that on their walk back home, Brown had the cigarillos in his hands in plain sight and two Ferguson police cars passed them, but did not stop.[148] When Wilson encountered them, he told the two to \"get the fuck on the sidewalk\" and Johnson told him they would be off the street shortly as they were close to their destination.[149] Johnson testified Wilson was the aggressor from the beginning and that for no apparent reason, he backed his vehicle up and tried to open his door, but Brown shut it, preventing him from getting out.[149] Johnson said Wilson then reached out and grabbed Brown by the neck and the two were engaged in a \"tug of war\", Wilson's left hand progressively slipping from Brown's neck to his right arm.[13] Brown braced himself on the vehicle's door with his left arm, which Johnson believed Wilson may have grabbed with his right arm at one point.[13] Wilson drew his gun with his right hand[13] and said \"I'll shoot\". Johnson said he never saw Brown hit Wilson and did not think Brown grabbed for Wilson's gun,[149][150] although he admitted the possibility that Brown's left arm could have been inside the vehicle while Johnson wasn't looking.[13] Following a gunshot, Johnson said they both ran[note 5] and Wilson fired while Brown was running away, Brown turned around and \"at that time Big Mike's hands was up, but not so much in the air, because he had been struck\".[150] Johnson told the jurors Brown said \"I don't have a gun\", was mad and tried to say again \"I don't have a gun\", but \"before he can say the second sentence or before he can even get it out, that's when the several more shots came.\" In his testimony, Johnson maintained Brown did not run at Wilson prior to the fatal shots.[150] The Department of Justice concluded that Johnson's testimony was not credible due to its inconsistencies with evidence, internal inconsistencies and lack of corroboration by credible witness accounts. The DOJ was also skeptical that Johnson would have been in a position to witness the final shots, and believed that Johnson may have fled the scene prior or had his back to the shooting while seeking cover.[13] Nine witness testimonies were judged by the Department of Justice as neither fully supportive nor inculpating of Wilson.[13]: pp.36–43 One, that of witness 107, who was seated in the same minivan as witness 104, reported that Wilson was standing outside the passenger side of his vehicle at the time that Brown started to run away.[note 1] Unlike witness 104, witness 107 was uncertain whether Brown subsequently charged at Wilson. Witness 107 reported that Wilson shot Brown while Brown was running away, and that the last shots were fired while Wilson was 10 to 15 feet away from Brown. The investigators reported that witness 107 was visibly shaken at what she had witnessed, which may have contributed to inconsistencies in her testimony.[13] Witness 106, the driver of the minivan, disagreed with witness 107 that Brown had put his hands up before moving toward Wilson. Brown's gesture was instead characterized by this witness as Brown having \"briefly flung\" out his arms. However, the view witness 106 had of Brown was partially obstructed by Wilson's body.[13] Witnesses 110 and 111 were interviewed on the evening of the incident and were shaken; witness 111 was crying. Witnesses 110 and 111 both witnessed the shooting, first from a driveway and then a balcony. They had passed Brown and Johnson walking on the street while in a vehicle en route to the house. They saw Wilson backing his vehicle up to block Brown and Johnson, but could not see what went on in the vehicle because they were watching from the passenger side. Johnson disappeared at the first shot, and Brown and Wilson continued to grapple until a second shot was fired and Brown ran away. Witness 110 observed Brown stopping, looking at his bloodied left hand, putting his arms out to his sides in a \"what the heck\" gesture and turning and going toward Wilson with his hands in the same posture. Witness 110 initially stated that Brown moved \"quickly\" back toward Wilson, though witness 110 later denied that Brown had been charging or running at Wilson to the grand jury and could not provide a characterization of Brown's movement. According to witness 111, it seemed that Brown was moving \"in slow motion\" toward Wilson.[13] Witness 115 recorded on their cell phone video of the incident that \"dude [Brown] was all up in his [Wilson's] car, dude [Brown] was punching on him.\" Witness 115 believed that Brown was winning in the fight, and from the vantage point of witness 115, was likely striking Wilson. There was a gap in witness 115's testimony as the shooting stopped, witness 115 went out onto their balcony, then went back inside to retrieve the phone, which they inadvertently left on their dresser, called out to family members and reemerged on the balcony. At this point, they saw Brown, whose arms were folded on his stomach,[note 6] walking back toward Wilson. Brown was reportedly not surrendering and did not have his hands up, but was falling to the ground as he approached Wilson. Wilson fired a series of shots, and Brown fell to the ground over one arm, with the other at his side. Wilson did not touch Brown's body and was speaking on a radio with his gun drawn.[13] Witness 114 saw Wilson stop his vehicle and lean out of the driver's window, perhaps to say something to Brown. Brown made a hand gesture. Wilson's vehicle continued on initially, but then was jerked back and parked at an angle. Witness 129 stated that this was to cut off Brown and Johnson.[13] Witness 116 looked out their blinds in response to screams. They saw Brown with his hands inside Wilson's vehicle. Witness 116 reported seeing Wilson use what they thought was a taser, but miss.[note 7] They then heard or saw Wilson fire a gun once or twice. Witness 116 saw Brown run away, and assumed that he had been apprehended. However, after hearing five or six additional gunshots, they looked out again to see Brown dead on the ground.[13] Witness 110 and 141 reported that Wilson only shot at Brown while Brown moved toward him, not while Brown was fleeing.[13] The DOJ concluded that they had identified no testimony that could inculpate Wilson that was consistent with other inculpating witness testimony, consistent with the prior statements of the witness and with the physical evidence.[13]: p.36 Peaceful protests and civil disorder broke out the day following Brown's shooting and lasted for several days. This was in part due to the belief among many that Brown was surrendering, as well as longstanding racial tensions between the minority-black population and the majority-white city government and police.[151] As the details of the original shooting event emerged from investigators, police grappled with establishing curfews and maintaining order, while members of the Ferguson community demonstrated in various ways in the vicinity of the original shooting. On August 10, a day of memorials began peacefully, but some crowd members became unruly after an evening candlelight vigil.[152] Local police stations assembled approximately 150 officers in riot gear.[153] Some people began looting businesses, vandalizing vehicles, and confronting police officers who sought to block off access to several areas of the city.[152] Widespread media coverage examined the post-9/11 trend of local police departments arming themselves with military-grade weapons when dealing with protests.[154][155] In the days following the shooting, state and federal officials weighed in on the matter. On August 12, President Barack Obama offered his condolences to Brown's family and community.[156] On August 14, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky said in an op-ed in Time Magazine, that the event was a tragedy and that police forces need to be demilitarized.[157] On August 15, a report and video showing the robbery of a convenience store by Brown was released by the Ferguson Police Department. Brown was accompanied by his friend Dorian Johnson. The report and video were part of a packet that included information about the shooting afterward.[158][159][160] The report containing frames of the surveillance footage showed Brown grabbing a box of cigarillos, followed by an apparent struggle or confrontation between Brown and a store clerk.[161][162] The statutory deadline in the Sunshine Law, Missouri's equivalent of the federal Freedom of Information Act, was the cited reason for the release following requests by St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Judicial Watch and others.[163][164][165] The Department of Justice had urged the video not be released, saying a release would inflame tension.[166] Missouri Governor Jay Nixon identified the release as an attempt to disparage Brown during the investigation that would inflame the community.[167][168] Brown's family released a statement in which they condemn the way the police chief chose to disseminate information, calling it character assassination following the \"execution-style murder\" of their son.[169] The August 15 release of information was criticized as part of an erratic and infrequent release of information by the police.[170] Previously, the police withheld the name of the officer involved in the shooting, citing safety concerns following death threats against the unnamed officer.[158] The St Louis County Police incident report lacked details.[171] The Ferguson Police incident report was obtained by the ACLU after a request and subsequent lawsuit.[172] Wilson did not file an incident report[171] and there was no Ferguson Police use-of-force report related to the incident.[173] The Ferguson Police Department refused to commit to a deadline for releasing a full autopsy report.[147] When the report and video were released, the police said Wilson had known Brown was a suspect in the robbery.[174] In a media conference, Ferguson's chief of police Tom Jackson said the robbery was unrelated to the initial contact, and had nothing to do with Wilson stopping Brown and Johnson.[158][174] Jackson later clarified Wilson recognized Brown as a suspect because he saw a box of cigars in his hand.[37][175] Eugene O'Donnell, a former district attorney in New York City who now serves as a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said, while the police officer may have stopped Brown for jaywalking, Brown may have been thinking the officer knew about the robbery: \"Obviously the cop's reaction is not affected, but what could be affected is [Brown's] reaction to the cop.\"[176] A Pew Research Center Survey published on August 18 suggested differences in American public opinion between whites and blacks. It indicated 80% of blacks and 37% of whites believed the shooting \"raises important issues about race\".[177] On August 24, St. Louis held their annual Peace Fest, which had a particular focus on Mike Brown. In attendance was Mike Brown's father, Mike Brown Sr., as well as the parents of Trayvon Martin (an unarmed black teen who was shot and killed in Florida in 2012).[178] In August, Chief Jackson said Wilson had been injured in the incident.[179] Wilson's medical record shows his injuries were diagnosed as a facial contusion or bruise.[180] Brown's funeral was held on August 25 and was attended by an estimated 4,500 people.[181][182] Al Sharpton delivered one of two eulogies.[183][184] On October 22, anonymous sources leaked to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch what they described as Wilson's grand jury testimony.[185] The Justice Department issued a statement that it \"considers the selective release of information in this investigation to be irresponsible and highly troubling. Since the release of the convenience-store footage, there seems to be an inappropriate effort to influence public opinion about this case.\"[185] Wilson's defense team denied they were behind the leaks, saying they \"[were] not in possession of any of the disclosed reports or the investigative report\".[185] The St. Louis County prosecutor spokesperson said his office would not investigate the leaks because they could not force journalists to divulge their sources, and \"you can tell by the information they have that the leaks are not coming from the grand jury or the prosecutor's office.\"[186] The leaks concerning grand jury testimony were condemned by the Justice Department as inappropriate effort to influence public opinion about this case.[185] The leaks referred to evidence supporting Wilson's testimony and decreased the likelihood of an indictment whilst fanning the flames of angry protesters.[187] Following the grand jury announcement, protests, some of them violent, broke out in Ferguson and other cities across the United States. Several Ferguson businesses were looted and fires set by protesters. Protests erupted in 170 cities across the U.S., including[188] St Louis, Philadelphia, Seattle, Albuquerque, New York City, Cleveland, Los Angeles, Oakland, Minneapolis, Atlanta, Chicago, and Boston.[189] Numerous media reports and legal experts criticized the process for failing to return an indictment in cases concerning law enforcement officers.[190][191] A December 2014 opinion poll by Washington Post-ABC News showed a majority of blacks do not believe that they receive treatment equal to whites by the police or the criminal justice system. Six out of ten white Americans believe the police treat races equally with roughly half of white Americans believing the criminal justice provides equal treatment, but there is a sharp partisan divide between white Americans. Conservative or Republican white Americans are far more likely to say whites and blacks receive equal treatment in the justice system than the liberal or Democratic white Americans.[192][note 8] On March 4, the U.S. Department of Justice announced Wilson would not be charged in the shooting. Its report said \"[t]here is no evidence upon which prosecutors can rely to disprove Wilson's stated subjective belief that he feared for his safety,\" and that accounts that Brown put his hands up are \"inaccurate because they are inconsistent with the physical and forensic evidence\".[193] President Obama reacted to the announcement, stating, \"The finding that was made [by the Department of Justice] was that it was not unreasonable to determine that there was not sufficient evidence to charge Officer Wilson. That was an objective, thorough, independent federal investigation.\" He further added, \"We may never know exactly what happened. But Officer Wilson like anybody else who is charged with a crime benefits from due process and a reasonable doubt standard.\"[194] In a Gallup Poll taken in June and July 2015, 8% of black respondents answered that local police treat racial minorities \"very fairly\" while 44% of black respondents answered \"fairly\". In contrast, 29% of non-Hispanic white respondents answered that local police treat racial minorities \"very fairly\" while 49% of non-Hispanic white respondents answered \"fairly\". In the same poll, 38% of black respondents and 18% of non-Hispanic white respondents indicated a preference for \"greater police presence in their local communities.\"[195][196] Various heads of state and foreign news organizations have commented on the shooting and subsequent protests including the Chinese Xinhua News Agency, Germany's Der Spiegel,[197] Egypt's Ministry of Foreign affairs,[198] the Iranian Islamic Republic News Agency,[197] protesters throughout the Middle East,[199] the Russian Foreign Ministry,[197] Spain's El Mundo,[200] the British Metro,[201] and others.[197] Amnesty International (AI) sent a team of human rights observers, trainers, and researchers to Ferguson. It was the first time the organization deployed such a team in the United States.[202][203] In a press release, AI USA director Steven W. Hawkins said, \"The U.S. cannot continue to allow those obligated and duty-bound to protect to become those who their community fears most.\"[204][205] On October 24, AI published a report declaring human rights abuses in Ferguson. The report cited the use of lethal force in Brown's death, racial discrimination and excessive use of police force, imposition of restrictions on the rights to protest, intimidation of protesters, the use of tear gas, rubber bullets, and long range acoustic devices, restrictions imposed on the media covering the protests, and lack of accountability for law enforcement policing protests.[206][207] The grand jury process was atypical because of significant and numerous departures from other normal grand jury proceedings. The American grand jury process operates in secret, with the proceedings, evidence and testimony rarely being released to the public in cases of no indictment. From the beginning, McCulloch desired to provide transparency to the process and had the proceeding transcribed with the intention of releasing the materials to the public if there was no indictment. Paul Cassell, former U.S. federal judge, said the investigative grand jury was unique because they were investigating with no assurance that any criminal conduct was present, in contrast to normal grand jury proceedings which have been screened for probable cause by a prosecutor. McCulloch's intentions to present all the evidence resulted in the proceedings which took far longer than regular grand juries which decide within days.[65] Earlier in the hearing, the prosecution presented a 1979 Missouri statute allowing officers to use deadly force \"to effect the arrest or prevent the escape from custody [of a person]\". Before the grand jury deliberated, jurors were told to disregard the previous instructions and use case law from the Tennessee v Garner ruling, which said it was unconstitutional for police officers to use deadly force to apprehend non-dangerous fleeing suspects.[208] Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster, acknowledged the grand jury was given information based on the state law before being informed that deadly force cannot be used merely to prevent the escape of an unarmed suspect.[208][209] MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell argued that this change amounted to a deliberate attempt by the prosecution to make it impossible to indict Wilson.[209] Andrew F. Branca, a Massachusetts lawyer focusing on self-defense law, attributed O'Donnell's comments as a straw man because self-defense is a completely independent and sufficient justification for the use of deadly force.[210] The St. Louis Public Radio later clarified that even if Wilson was indicted and convicted at trial based on the Garner ruling, the conviction could be challenged on the basis that Missouri law permitted the use of deadly force.[208] The prosecution's handling of the case received particular attention. Roger Parloff said prosecutors do not usually exclude truly exculpatory evidence and that prosecutors do not typically indict if they believe the accused is not guilty, disagreeing with the notion that McCulloch should have presented evidence with the purpose of obtaining an indictment.[211] Jay Sterling Silver said the grand jury case indicated a conflict of interest between local prosecutors and police, as the former needs to maintain a good relationship with law enforcement.[212] Mark O'Mara said the unusual process was to avoid arguments that the presentation was to effect a particular result, yet despite this McCulloch was still criticized for the decision. Paul Callan, former deputy chief of homicide in the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office, gave a layered response which asserted the choice to present all the evidence was unusual, but not unprecedented in controversial cases. Callan said some prosecutors use the grand jury process as political cover in cases which would not succeed at trial, and in cases in which subsequent investigations and civil lawsuits would raise further criticism.[135] William Fitzpatrick, of the National District Attorneys Association, said it was not strange for prosecutors in police-involved cases to provide all available evidence and not ask for a specific charge and defended McCulloch's inclusion of evidence.[83] Jeffrey Toobin agreed the exoneration may have been well-justified because a conviction would have been very unlikely at a trial, but the process that was used does not inspire confidence in the legal system.[135] In a later interview, McCulloch defended the choice to include all evidence and not skew the presentation just for the sake of getting an indictment.[81] The New York Times described prosecutors' questioning of Wilson as \"gentle\" and said it contrasted with the sharp challenges to witnesses whose accounts seemed to contradict Wilson's, and reported this had led some to question whether the process was as objective as McCulloch had claimed. The Times reported prosecutors asked witness after witness if Brown appeared to be reaching for a weapon when confronting Wilson, though few of them said this. Furthermore, contradictions in testimony by Wilson and other law-enforcement officers were left unchallenged by prosecutors.[86] CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin criticized the prosecutors for asking softball questions during the cross examination of Wilson's testimony, and referred particularly to the fact that no witness could corroborate Wilson's story that he had warned Brown twice to lie down on the ground, and when asked, witnesses said they did not hear him say that.[213] After the grand jury's decision was announced, Brown's stepfather, Louis Head, turned to a crowd of demonstrators who had gathered, and yelled \"Burn this bitch down\", according to a New York Times video.[214] Moments before, he had said \"If I get up [on the platform] I'm gonna start a riot.\"[215] He later apologized for the outburst.[216] By September 24, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson publicly apologized to the family of Michael Brown.[217] By March 12, five months later, Thomas Jackson resigned from the Ferguson Police Department.[218] On November 29, Wilson resigned from the Ferguson police force with no severance, citing security concerns.[219][220] Wilson's lawyer said Wilson \"will never be a police officer again\" as he does not want to put other officers at risk due to his presence.[221] The National Bar Association, an organization of African American lawyers and judges, made a complaint to the Missouri Department of Public Safety demanding Wilson's police officer license be revoked.[222] Wilson's attempts to obtain employment as a police officer have been unsuccessful.[223] President Barack Obama announced the federal government would spend $75 million on body cameras for law enforcement officers, as one of the measures taken in response to the shooting.[224][225] According to the Associated Press' annual poll of United States news directors and editors, the top news story of 2014 was police killings of unarmed black people—including the shooting of Brown—as well as their investigations and the protests in their aftermath.[226][227] Roger Goldman, emeritus professor at Saint Louis University Law School, Flanders, a Saint Louis University law professor, and Senator Jamilah Nasheed seek the updating of Missouri state law to comply with the 1985 U.S. Supreme Court decision, Tennessee v. Garner.[208] The cover of The New Yorker's January 26, 2015, issue depicted Martin Luther King Jr. linking arms with Eric Garner and Wenjian Liu, and joined by Trayvon Martin and Brown.[228] Funds for the Brown family and for Wilson were solicited on the internet,[229][230] each accumulating hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations.[231] In August 2018, Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch lost re-election to reformist Wesley Bell by double-digit margins, ending McCulloch's 28-year incumbency.[232] The QuikTrip where Michael Brown had a confrontation with a clerk (which led to the police call)[233] was looted and burned the next day,[234] along with other stores in the neighborhood. Rather than rebuilding, the corporation donated the site to the Urban League of Metropolitan St. Louis and the Salvation Army. The organizations built the Ferguson Community Empowerment Center on the site, which opened in 2017.[234] The Urban League began suburban street outreach for the first time, and is also redeveloping other vacant lots.[233] The Ferguson effect is an increase in violent crime rates in a community caused by reduced proactive policing due to the community's distrust and hostility towards police.[235] The Ferguson effect was first proposed after police saw an increase in violence following the shooting of Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. The term was coined by Doyle Sam Dotson III, the chief of the St. Louis police, to account for an increased murder rate in some U.S. cities following the Ferguson unrest.[236] \"Hands up, don't shoot\", or simply \"hands up\", is a slogan and gesture originating from the incident and was seen in demonstrations in Ferguson and throughout the United States.[237] The gesture became a rallying cry against police violence.[238][239][240] On March 4, 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice issued a report on the shooting,[13] which said, \"There is no witness who has stated that Brown had his hands up in surrender whose statement is otherwise consistent with the physical evidence\" and \"our investigation did not reveal any eyewitness who stated that Brown said 'don't shoot'.\"[241][242] On December 20, two NYPD officers were shot and killed in their police car in Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. The suspected gunman, Ismaaiyl Brinsley, posted days earlier on Instagram his intention to kill police officers in response to the killings of Brown and Eric Garner.[243] The suspect, who had a long criminal record and had shot his girlfriend in the stomach a few hours earlier, entered the New York City Subway and committed suicide.[244][245][246] On March 12, 2015, two police officers were wounded by gunfire outside the Ferguson police headquarters. The officers, one from nearby Webster Groves, the other from the St. Louis County Police, were providing security at a protest being staged outside the station.[247] Two days later, 20-year-old Jeffrey L. Williams was arrested in connection with the shooting.[248] Williams' attorney said, although Williams fired the shots, he was not aiming at the officers.[249] Eighteen-year-old Tyrone Harris (friend of Brown) was shot by police in Ferguson on August 9, 2015, one year after the shooting of Michael Brown.[250][251] That same day, the Columbia (Missouri) Police Officers' Association (CPOA) proclaimed \"Darren Wilson Day\", calling Wilson an \"innocent, but persecuted, officer\" and insisted his ethnicity had nothing to do with their support of him.[252] An ABC affiliate reported the post was shared nearly 60 times on the site before being removed. The CPOA then posted its support for Wilson and \"all law enforcement officers who endure similar situations.\"[253] In December 2014, president Barack Obama created a commission to make recommendations for broad police reform in the United States. The commission created by Obama released an interim report on March 2, 2015, with numerous recommendations, including the recommendation that policy be created mandating \"external and independent criminal investigations in cases of police use of force resulting in death, officer-involved shootings resulting in injury or death, or in-custody deaths\".[254] On September 5, 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice began an investigation of the Ferguson, Missouri, police force to examine whether officers routinely engaged in racial profiling or showed a pattern of excessive force. The investigation was separate from the Department's other investigation of the shooting of Brown.[255] The results of the investigation were released in a March 4, 2015, report, which concluded officers in Ferguson routinely violated the constitutional rights of the city's residents, by discriminating against African Americans and applying racial stereotypes, in a \"pattern or practice of unlawful conduct within the Ferguson Police Department that violates the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and federal statutory law.\"[256][257] The report focused on the problem of issuing warrants for sometimes minor offenses. In many states, a chief cause for warrants is unpaid traffic tickets.[258] On April 23, 2015, the Brown family filed a wrongful death lawsuit in state court against Wilson, Jackson, and the City of Ferguson, asking for damages in excess of $75,000 as well as attorney's fees.[259][260] On May 27, 2015, the lawsuit was moved from state court to federal court.[261] On July 14, 2015, U.S. District Judge E. Richard Webber responded to defense motions by dismissing four of the seven counts of the lawsuit and declining to dismiss two other counts.[262][263] On June 20, 2017, Webber approved a settlement between Brown's parents and the city of Ferguson. Terms of the agreement, including the settlement amount, were sealed from the public.[264][265] A Ferguson city attorney revealed the city's insurance company paid $1.5 million.[266] On April 29, 2015, Johnson filed a lawsuit in state court against Wilson, Jackson, and the City of Ferguson for being stopped by Wilson without probable cause, reasonable suspicion or legal justification to detain him. The lawsuit claimed that, according to the findings of the § DOJ investigation into the Ferguson Police Department, law enforcement efforts focused on generating revenue rather than protecting the town's citizens. Johnson sought US$25,000 in damages.[267][268][269] On May 27, 2015, the lawsuit was moved from state court to federal court.[270] The court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the case; they appealed, and a three-judge panel of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court on July 25, 2017,[271] allowing the lawsuit to go forward. The en banc Eighth Circuit reviewed and reversed the panel's decision on June 17, 2019, directing the district court to dismiss the case.[272] On May 9, 2016, Delrish Moss, a Miami law enforcement veteran and expert in community relations,[273] was sworn in as the first permanent African American chief in Ferguson. He said his challenges would include diversifying the police force and dramatically improving community relations.[274] Moss resigned and returned to Miami in October 2018. In 2023, Troy Doyle became the new police chief. According to Doyle, as a teenager growing up in northern St. Louis County, he was pulled over so many times on his commute that he bought a radar detector to avoid police. He says while he was stopped in a parking lot, a police officer pulled up and demanded identification for no apparent reason, noticed the radar detector, and took it without compensation after falsely stating it had shown up as stolen. Doyle says the incident is what inspired him to public service.[233] The police department went from having three African-American officers in 2014 to roughly half in 2024, with only four officers still on board who had been serving at the time of the Brown shooting.[233] On April 25, 2018, Brown's mother, Lezley McSpadden, announced to a Harvard University forum on police violence that she would run for City Council of Ferguson.[275] She did not win.[276] The same month Brown was shot dead, American rappers The Game, Rick Ross, 2 Chainz, Diddy, Fabolous, Wale, DJ Khaled, Swizz Beatz, Yo Gotti, Curren$y, Problem, King Pharoah and recording group TGT released the song \"Don't Shoot\" as a tribute to Brown.[277] On De L'Amour — his final studio album released before his death in 2017 — the French rock and roll singer Johnny Hallyday sings \"Dans la peau de Mike Brown\", a song against racial crimes and in memory of Mike Brown.[278] On November 28, 2014, musician and filmmaker Richard Rossi was in the news regarding the controversy over the shooting of Michael Brown. Rossi wrote and recorded a protest song expressing his feelings about a grand jury's decision not to charge a white police officer in the death of the unarmed black teen in Ferguson, Missouri. \"I wrote the song in five minutes as a way to express my emotions about the danger of trigger-happy police,\" Rossi said. \"I filmed it on my laptop at my kitchen table and uploaded it to YouTube.\" Rossi uploaded the video on November 26, and provided the song's lyrics in the video description. Here is a sample from the song's beginning, printed in the Los Angeles Daily News: \"Down at the courthouse on a Monday afternoon/Justice was thrown right out the window when a young white cop entered the room.\"[279] In Prince's song about the 2015 Baltimore protests, \"Baltimore\", he sings \"does anybody hear us pray for Michael Brown or Freddie Gray?\".[280][281] In 2015, actor Ezra Miller directed a short film titled The Truth According to Darren Wilson. In the film, Wilson recounts his version of events, ending in him being called into a room to tell it to investigators, implying that Wilson unlawfully murdered Brown, and that he later lied about the events of that day.[282][283] Brown's death is the subject of the song \"What It Means\" by Drive-By Truckers on their 2016 album American Band.[284][285] Iconographer Mark Dukes created the icon Our Lady of Ferguson in response to the shooting.[286] Poet Danez Smith published a poem entitled \"not an Elegy for Mike Brown\", written the night of the incident.[287][288] Seattle based rapper Macklemore mentions Wilson in the song \"White Privilege II\" from his second collaborative effort with producer Ryan Lewis, 2016's This Unruly Mess I've Made: \"My success is the product of the same system that let off Darren Wilson – guilty\"[289] In 2016, a chapter about Black Lives Matter memorials to Brown and others was included in the book, \"The Sustainers: Being, Building and Doing Good through the Sacred Spaces of Civil Rights, Human Rights and Social Movements,\" by preservationist Catherine Fleming Bruce. The book won the 2017 University of Mary Washington Historic Preservation Book Prize.[290] English folk singer Reg Meuross included a song called \"The Lonesome Death of Michael Brown\" on his 2017 album Faraway People.[291] The song's title acknowledges Bob Dylan's song against racism in the 1960s, \"The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll\", which describes the death in Baltimore of a bartender at the hands of a drunk patron, who struck her with a cane causing her to die of a brain hemorrhage. Poet Nicole Sealey wrote The Ferguson Report: An Erasure, a book length erasure[292] of the Ferguson Report [293] which comments on the Killing of Michael Brown and the subsequent Ferguson unrest. Her poem \"Pages 22–29\", an excerpt from the book, won a Forward Prize for Poetry in October 2021.[294]",
