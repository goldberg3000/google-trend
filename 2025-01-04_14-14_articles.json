See how every lawmaker voted here. • Trump’s challenge: The first vote of the 119th Congress underscored the president-elect’s hold over the Republican Party — and the tall task of keeping it together over the next two years ahead of the 2026 midterms, which could threaten the GOP’s Washington trifecta. • Key procedural change: In a significant victory for Johnson, the House made it harder to remove a speaker by approving a key procedural change that requires a minimum of nine GOP lawmakers to force a vote on an ouster. Previously, it only required one member to force a vote. We’ve wrapped up our live coverage for the day. Read more here on the vote for Speaker of the House Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy posted a picture with President-elect Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Friday, hours after House Speaker Mike Johnson was re-elected on the first vote – starkly different from McCarthy’s election in 2023. “Always great spending time with President Trump tonight,” McCarthy posted alongside Trump, who gave a thumbs up. In another post with the same photo over music, McCarthy wrote, “Catching up with President Trump today. 17 days to go.” McCarthy was elected speaker after 15 votes and ultimately ousted after former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz offered a motion to vacate the chair on the House floor, which prevailed. Johnson succeeded McCarthy about three weeks after McCarthy was ousted. Ahead of Friday’s vote, Johnson earned Trump’s endorsement. President-elect Donald Trump announced Friday that Morgan Ortagus would serve as “Deputy Special Presidential Envoy for Middle East Peace.” “Early on Morgan fought me for three years, but hopefully has learned her lesson,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “These things usually don’t work out, but she has strong Republican support, and I’m not doing this for me, I’m doing it for them. Let’s see what happens. She will hopefully be an asset to Steve, a great leader and talent, as we seek to bring calm and prosperity to a very troubled region. I expect great results, and soon!” The president-elect, in his post, also detailed Ortagus’ experience as an active US Navy Reserve Intelligence Officer and as spokesperson at the Department of State. Trump named his longtime friend Steve Witkoff as special envoy to the Middle East last year. Some House Republicans and Democrats are warning Speaker Mike Johnson of the challenges ahead in a tight 119th Congress where the GOP has one of the narrowest House majorities in nearly 100 years. Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert, who had declined to say if she would back Johnson before ultimately voting for him Friday, said if he “does everything right” he can stay speaker. Boebert said she would prefer if it only required one member to threaten to oust Johnson. The House voted to adopt a rules package earlier today that allows for a 9-member motion to vacate the speakership. “If there’s enough compromise that is damaging to the agenda, there very well could be a motion to vacate,” Boebert said. “Do I have a plan to do that? I’m sure that’s your next question. No, but I haven’t seen what we’re doing at this time either. I hope Mike Johnson has the most successful speakership that we’ve seen.” Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal warned that Johnson may have a tougher time actually governing with his narrow margin because “if you can’t get a majority, you’ve gotta work with Democrats.” “The mood is not to bail him out this time around, especially after he screwed us on the last agreement that we made and he backed away from it,” she said, a reference to the bipartisan bill to fund the federal government that was scrapped in December after President-elect Donald Trump’s intervention. GOP Rep. Troy Nehls emphasized Trump’s role in helping Johnson secure the speakership as well as House Republicans winning the majority in the first place. “Trump gave us the gavel,” Nehls said. “I think Mike Johnson and the House of Representatives, we probably owe Donald Trump.” House Speaker Mike Johnson says he has not seen a letter signed by Rep. Chip Roy and other detractors, and that he can’t comment on their demands. “I haven’t seen it. I can’t comment on it,” he said. Roy was joined in the letter by 10 other House Republicans — Reps. Andy Harris, Scott Perry, Andy Biggs, Clay Higgins, Michael Cloud, Andy Ogles, Eli Crane, Eric Burlison, Ralph Norman and Andrew Clyde — who resisted Johnson’s return to the speakership but ultimately backed him on the first ballot Friday. In the letter, the lawmakers demanded that Johnson make several commitments to “prove he will not fail to enact President Trump’s bold agenda.” These demands included legislation banning member stock trading, rolling back Biden-Harris environmental policies, and cutting spending. Johnson has insisted he did not cut any deals in order to secure the gavel. Mike Johnson will keep his job as House speaker after a dramatic vote on Friday as the 119th Congress prepares to get to work. He won in the first round — but only after flipping two GOP opponents as the vote was held open to give Republicans more time to secure support for Johnson, who was backed by President-elect Donald Trump. Now that he is elected, Johnson faces a tough legislating challenge with the narrowest House majority in nearly 100 years. However, in a key victory for Johnson, the House made it harder to oust a speaker. Included as part of the sweeping package was a procedural change that will require a minimum of nine GOP lawmakers to force a vote to oust a speaker. Previously, it only required one member to force a vote.

In the Senate: Mike Johnson was elected Speaker of the House after flipping two votes from the nine Republicans who initially refused to support him. Johnson will face a big challenge in Congress with the narrowest House majority in nearly 100 years. CNN's Jake Tapper breaks down the vote. House Republicans will meet this weekend to flesh out their legislative priorities, planning for an ambitious agenda now that the GOP controls both chambers of Congress and the White House. The new Congress was sworn in Friday, and Speaker Mike Johnson was re-elected despite a very slim majority. The lawmakers will debate how to proceed on budget reconciliation, an expedited process for considering bills that would allow the party to push through their agenda without Democratic support. The House Republicans are expected to meet at Fort McNair in Washington, DC, on Saturday, and elected leadership is set to meet in Baltimore on Sunday. The House voted to make it harder to oust a speaker on Friday – another victory for Johnson after he retained the gavel in a nail-biter of a vote earlier in the day. The chamber voted to adopt a new rules package for the 119th Congress – a lengthy document that covers a wide array of rules and regulations. Included as part of the sweeping package is a procedural change that will require a minimum of nine GOP lawmakers to force a vote to oust a speaker. Previously, it only required one member to force a vote. That one-member threshold is what led to the ouster of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy when former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz forced a vote on his removal. The House voted 215 to 209 to approve the overall rules package. House Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern, the ranking member on the Rules Committee, criticized two additional provisions in the rules package. One is that the speaker can only entertain a motion to suspend the rules on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday – an apparent concession to the initial GOP holdouts in the speaker’s vote. House GOP leadership has sometimes brought bills – including major spending legislation – to the floor under suspension as a way of bypassing the House Rules committee, which Rep. Ralph Norman – one of the initial defectors who later flipped - sits on, lessening the panel’s power. This would limit leadership’s ability to do that. McGovern said Republicans “worked out another backroom deal,” and argued that the change could paralyze the House’s ability to move swiftly in the event of a major emergency, like a national disaster or terror attack. The congressman also said Republicans moved to “change words like child to son or daughter in our ethics rules” – with McGovern calling it “weird,” and saying, “they’re obsessed with this stuff.” Sens. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland and Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware became the third and fourth Black Democratic senators in the current Congress on Friday when Vice President Kamala Harris swore them in on Friday. There have only been 14 Black senators to serve in the US Senate. From slavery and Jim Crow laws to suppression of minority voters, Black political candidates have long faced stumbling blocks. Hiram Revels, the first Black US senator, took office in the late 1800s as part of a wave of African American lawmakers during the Reconstruction era, but he was elected by the Mississippi legislature, not the state’s voters. Also on Friday, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott became the longest-serving Black US senator. He is the sole Black Republican in the Senate. Scott will serve as the first Black chairman of a Senate standing committee, leading the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, where he previously served as the ranking Republican member when Democrats held control of the chamber in the previous session. Republican Rep. Ralph Norman, who initially voted against Mike Johnson before changing his vote, said the speaker had signaled in negotiations that he would allow more GOP voices at the table under his leadership this Congress. Asked by CNN’s Manu Raju if Johnson had made any commitments that made him change his mind, Norman said the speaker promised “more conservatives will be at the table on negotiations.” “Let’s put people like Chip Roy, and I’m just using him as an example, like other people who are true…know how to negotiate and we’ll fight and we’ll put things to the American people, much like what the DOGE commission intend to do,” he said, a reference to the newly created department aimed at cutting government spending led by Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk. Norman said he trusted that Johnson would “give us that platform,” and that the speaker had convinced both him and Rep. Keith Self, another Republican who voted against Johnson at first, to give him a chance. “He knew if it went to a second ballot it was going to get tougher,” Norman said. Asked what Donald Trump had said when they talked on the phone, Norman said the president-elect was “in the middle of a golf game” and brought up how the South Carolina Republican had voted for Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley in the primary. “I said, Yes sir, I did. We’re with you now and I said we will be with Mike Johnson,” Norman told reporters he responded to Trump, adding that he told him the president-elect would have to help House Republicans push his agenda. Norman said Trump had told him that Johnson was the only one who had the “likeability” to be speaker. House Speaker Mike Johnson is insisting that he did not cut deals with Reps. Ralph Norman and Keith Self to get over the finish line during today’s speaker vote. “There were no deals cut,” he told CNN’s Manu Raju. “I took suggestions and requests from all members on process reforms and changes, which I was already committed to. We made no deals to anyone, no quid pro quo to anybody on any position, or anything at all. Through the entire — I haven’t done that in 14 months, and I was not about to start today. And I think that’s important, because there needs to be transparency. Every member needs to be on a level playing field, and we maintained that today and I’m really proud of it.” Johnson said there would be a “new paradigm” and noted plans to “decentralize the speaker’s office and power.” “We’re going to have unified government with Republican control of the House, the Senate and the White House, so very different environment — 60% of the House Republicans have never served in a unified government situation. So, I had explained to them how the processes are different and the procedures, and that we are in, effectively, a law-making exercise every single day,” he said. Johnson said he had to “convince them that it will be a member-driven process.” Johnson acknowledged that President-elect Donald Trump’s support was very important. He argued Trump is “the most powerful president, certainly of the modern era, maybe in all of American history” and said the two work “very well together.” South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman, one of the key Republican holdouts who eventually switched his vote to support Speaker Mike Johnson, said he didn’t get anything for throwing his support behind the Louisiana lawmaker. “I didn’t get anything personally. Other than a commitment that things are going to change,” he said. “There will be a drastic change from the next 14 months.” Norman said the hour delay in the vote was worth it: “Absolutely. I would do it all over again.” He said his mind was eventually changed after talking with President-elect Donald Trump and Johnson, and assurances that things would change. “We had a good discussion. We had a talk with President Trump when we got in there. I never know how this stuff is going to come out, I don’t know how people are going to vote, we got together, Mike gave us his assurances, he is going to fight for the things we think are important for the country,” Norman said. Trump shored up support from the fairway: The president-elect, who publicly backed Johnson earlier this week, also talked to other key GOP holdouts before the vote was gaveled and the speaker emerged victorious. CNN’s Manu Raju reported Friday that Trump was in the middle of his golf game when he made calls for Johnson. This post has been updated with more details on Trump’s calls to lawmakers. Oklahoma GOP Rep. Tom Cole said the drama that unfolded on Capitol Hill on Friday over electing a speaker demonstrates that it’s going to be difficult to manage the House this Congress but said the positive outcome is also a “hopeful start.” “It’s going to be a challenging Congress and that’s not something new,” Cole said. “But the fact is it all got done on one ballot and that’s a lot better than 15, which is what it took last time. So, I’ll take that and I’m pleased.” Asked if he was worried critics of House Speaker Mike Johnson, who was reelected Friday, might turn on him over the course of the next two years, he said, “I worry about everything everyday. That’s just the nature of the business, but I thought this was a very hopeful start and it went very well.” Shortly after the House chose a new speaker, a New York judge upheld Donald Trump’s conviction in the hush-money case, rejecting the president-elect’s effort to throw out the jury’s verdict because of his re-election in November. New York Judge Juan Merchan set the sentencing for January 10, 2025 and said Trump can appear virtually or in person. However, in his ruling Merchan said Trump will face no legal penalties, indicating the case is essentially over. Trump was found guilty by a jury in May on 34 counts of falsifying business records. Trump lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. They previously indicated they would appeal any effort to sentence him prior to Inauguration Day on January 20. A spokesperson for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg declined to comment. The headine and the post have been updated with additional details from the ruling. Rep. Andy Biggs said Friday that President-elect Donald Trump’s endorsement of Mike Johnson was important in the House speaker’s reelection. When asked if he believes Johnson would’ve survived without Trump’s endorsement, Biggs said, “No. I think it was important.” Biggs also said he still has concerns about Johnson leading the conference but added that Trump’s endorsement was taken into consideration. “I have concerns, but President Trump said he wanted to work with Johnson, and basically — basically, that we took that into account,” Biggs said leaving the House floor. Additionally, Biggs said Johnson indicated “he’s going to work on various aspects of processes that we think need to be take place.” GOP Rep. Dusty Johnson denied on Friday that Republicans who initially resisted backing Mike Johnson for speaker received any specific commitments from him. “There wasn’t any particular deal or commitment. Nobody got anything other than Mike Johnson, who was willing to look people in the eye and tell them that we will have a more inclusive, collaborative and conservative agenda over the course of the next two years,” he told CNN’s Manu Raju. The South Dakota Republican said he didn’t want to talk about “specific asks or parts of the negotiation,” between the holdouts and leadership. “When you get the right people in the room and they want to get to yes, you absolutely can get to yes,” he said. He wouldn’t talk about “specific actions” by President-elect Donald Trump, whom CNN has reported called some last-minute holdouts before they ultimately backed the speaker. “Nobody’s got the kind of capital that President Trump does. He is clearly the captain of the football team,” he said. Rep. Keith Self, who initially cast his ballot for Florida Rep. Byron Donalds before changing his vote to House Speaker Mike Johnson, told CNN that he and Donald Trump spoke multiple times today and that they had a “lively discussion” about advancing the president-elect’s agenda. Self, who declined to provide details about the talks with Trump, said he decided to vote for Johnson because he got a commitment that GOP hardliners would be part of a major bill that Republicans want to advance using the budget process to enact aspects of the Trump agenda. “We shored up the reconciliation team because we know that this will be a heavy lift to get the Trump agenda across the line in the reconciliation package … That’s all we did,” Self said, later promising a “big, beautiful reconciliation package.” Self said the team working on the bill would include members beyond the leadership, including some members of the House Freedom Caucus, but said, “I won’t get ahead of the speaker,” when asked specifically who. Later, asked what swayed his vote, Self said he and Trump have the “same emphasis” on implementing the president-elect’s agenda. “We have got to make sure this Congress is as strong as possible when we go up against the Senate on reconciliation package, because there’s their debates on what the reconciliation package even looks like. So that’s all I wanted to do today, is to make this Congress successful for the Trump agenda,” Self said. Self said Trump did not warn him about facing a potential primary challenge over holding up Johnson’s speakership. This post has been updated with additional comments from Self. CNN’s Lauren Fox and Aileen Graef contributed reporting to this post. House Speaker Mike Johnson took his oath of office following a dramatic vote Thursday that narrowly secured him the speakership once again. Following his swearing-in, Johnson received a standing ovation from the majority of the chamber. He then administered the oath of office for all members of the House, swearing in the 119th Congress. A group of House Republicans who had been skeptical of House Speaker Mike Johnson — but ultimately came around, delivering a dramatic win on the first ballot Friday — released a letter outlining a list of demands they want Johnson to take up now that he has the speaker’s gavel. The 11 House Republicans, including Rep. Ralph Norman who was a holdout until the last minute, called on Johnson to add session days to the House calendar, ensure that any reconciliation package includes significant spending cuts, and stop putting bills on the floor that rely heavily on Democratic support, or that come ahead of the 72 hours members are allotted to review legislation. “Today we voted for Mike Johnson for Speaker of the House because of our steadfast support of President Trump and to ensure the timely certification of his electors,” the lawmakers wrote. “We did this despite our sincere reservations regarding the Speaker’s track record over the last 15 months.” Listing out their legislative priorities, the lawmakers said Johnson has “zero room for error.” House Speaker Mike Johnson said in his first remarks following his reelection to the speakership that the new Congress will “listen to the voices of the people.” “In recent months, we’ve witnessed something happening — something that’s really remarkable, a political moment in our modern history: A groundswell Americans from every state, race and religion who now demand that we put the interest of Americans first again,” Johnson said. “And we will.” Johnson also stressed that “the number one priority” under his leadership will be “defending our nation’s borders.” “In coordination with President Trump, this Congress will give our border and immigration enforcement agents the resources that they need to do their job,” Johnson outlined. “We will secure the border. We will deport dangerous, criminal, illegal aliens and finally finish building the border wall.” Johnson later in his remarks read a prayer entitled “Thomas Jefferson’s Prayer for the Nation.” “We will not fail. We cannot fail. We are all in this together. Our nation is counting on us to band together and solve these problems and get this done,” Johnson said after reading the prayer. “I’ve said before that I believe God has elevated each one of you, that is my belief, to your positions of leadership and it’s an act of providence that you’ve all been placed in your specific roles in this specific moment at this historic time.” Newly elected House Speaker Mike Johnson said it is “the great honor of his life” to serve the House and noted that it is “a momentous time” in the nation’s history. In his first remarks after being elected speaker on Friday, he noted that the 250th anniversary of the country’s founding will occur during the 119th Congress. “And in these two and a half centuries, we’ve been reminded repeatedly that freedom is never free. We have stood tall as the greatest nation on the face of the earth,” Johnson said, adding the United States was the freest and most benevolent nation that has ever been.“It’s not by happenstance. We are the ones who settled the West. We are the ones who ended slavery, who laid the transcontinental railroad, who gave women the right to vote, who won two world wars, who landed on the moon and who won the Cold War. Throughout our history, we have done what no one thought was possible. And still at 250 years old, our nation is actually a young nation.” In his first remarks after being reelected as House speaker, Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana called for a moment of silence to mark the New Year’s Day terrorist attack in New Orleans. “Of course, these are difficult days in our home state of Louisiana, where I come from,” Johnson said in the House. “We all know about the terrorist attack in New Orleans and it’s really shaken our state. People are reeling from that attack.” The attacker rammed a pickup truck into a crowd, which killed 14 people and injuring dozens more. President-elect Donald Trump congratulated Rep. Mike Johnson after the Republican from Louisiana was elected speaker on Friday. “Congratulations to Speaker Mike Johnson for receiving an unprecedented Vote of Confidence in Congress. Mike will be a Great Speaker, and our Country will be the beneficiary. The People of America have waited four years for Common Sense, Strength, and Leadership. They’ll get it now, and America will be greater than ever before!” Trump posted on Truth Social. The president-elect threw his support behind Johnson earlier this week. He spoke to Reps. Ralph Norman and Keith Self as Republicans worked to convince them to vote for Johnson and give him the victory on the first ballot, multiple sources told CNN. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries urged lawmakers to “put down partisan swords and pick up bipartisan plowshares” as he introduced House Speaker Mike Johnson, who won a dramatic vote to keep the gavel. “It’s time for us to come together, not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans, to get things done for the people,” Jeffries said. He vowed that House Democrats would work to find common ground with Republicans “on any issue, whenever and wherever possible.” Jeffries laid out an agenda of top issues for his party, including enacting policies that benefit the middle class, lowering housing costs and securing the country’s borders. Still, with Republicans taking control of both chambers of Congress and the presidency, Jeffries warned that Democrats will “push back against far right extremism whenever necessary” and protect programs like Social Security and Medicare. “Our position is that it is not acceptable to cut Social Security, cut Medicare, cut Medicaid, cut veterans benefits, or cut nutritional assistance from children and families in order to pay for massive tax breaks for billionaires and wealthy corporations,” Jeffries said. Jeffries also acknowledged Rep. Nancy Pelosi, who was back in the chamber after breaking her hip. This post has been updated with more remarks from Jeffries. After being elected speaker of the House on the first ballot, Mike Johnson is set to face a big challenge in Congress, with the most narrow House majority in nearly 100 years. CNN Washington Bureau Chief and Political Director David Chalian says Johnson knows this. “He understands the problematic path he has ahead to get Trump’s legislative agenda through in a clean way in this first year of full Republican control in Washington,” Chalian said of Johnson after his dramatic victory Friday. Chalian said he doesn’t think voters “put too much stock in all of this.” Instead, he argued, voters “will focus a lot more on what this new unified Republican control of Washington attempts to deliver for the American people.” President-elect Donald Trump spoke to Reps. Ralph Norman and Keith Self as Republicans worked to convince them to vote for House Speaker Mike Johnson and give Johnson the victory on the first ballot, multiple sources told CNN. GOP Rep. Nancy Mace called Trump, one of the sources told CNN, who then spoke directly to the holdouts. The president-elect threw his support behind Johnson earlier this week. Trump told reporters Tuesday night that he would make calls on Johnson’s behalf to fellow Republicans, if necessary. House Speaker Mike Johnson said he did not make any promises to GOP Reps. Keith Self and Ralph Norman, who flipped their votes and allowed Johnson to clinch speakership in the first round of voting. Johnson, who could only lose one vote with the slim GOP majority, needed the support of Self and Norman as Republican Rep. Thomas Massie maintained his opposition. Rep. Andy Ogles, a Republican from Tennessee, also said that no deals were made to get Johnson’s detractors on board, adding that instead, it “was just a matter of getting it done” and a result of “persistence.” The reelected speaker told CNN that he is “ready to get to work.” In a dramatic turn of events, lawmakers have elected Mike Johnson as House speaker on the first ballot. Key GOP detractors flipped their votes to back Johnson at the last minute, after the Louisiana Republican was initially on track to lose. He ultimately won with 218 votes. While Johnson will keep the gavel, he’ll face a big challenge in Congress with the narrowest House majority in nearly 100 years. How it unfolded: After the initial roll call vote, Johnson had come up short, with three GOP defections — more than he could afford to lose. Rep. Thomas Massie had voted for Rep. Tom Emmer; Rep. Ralph Norman had voted for Rep. Jim Jordan; and Rep. Keith Self had voted for Rep. Byron Donalds. With all members voting, Johnson could only afford a single GOP defection. But after everyone had voted, the vote was held open for an extended period of time — meaning that it was not gaveled to an official close — and Johnson worked to lock down the votes. Then, Self and Norman flipped their votes in support of Johnson. This post has been updated with additional details on how the vote unfolded. The White House declined to weigh in on the unfolding fight for the House speaker’s gavel on Capitol Hill. Instead, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters during Friday’s press briefing it was focused on the president’s domestic agenda for the remainder of his term in office. “Look, we’ve always been very clear from here, from this administration, that we do not inject ourselves into any leadership election that is happening in Congress,” she said, adding that it “doesn’t matter if it’s a Democrat or Republican, we stay out of it.” “The president is going to continue to focus on the job that he has ahead, 17 days of a jam-packed schedule, focusing on the American people. We’re going to let Congress do their business,” Jean-Pierre said. But in 2023, as the House GOP slugged it out over who would serve as speaker, White House spokesperson Andrew Bates lambasted Republicans for “falling over one another to find out who can be the most erratic and out of step with the priorities of working families.” In a statement to reporters at the time, he urged lawmakers “to get their act together and join this president at the adults table.” While Mike Johnson is on track to lose, the first round of voting in the speaker’s election has not yet been gaveled to an official close. As a result, members continue to mill around on the floor talking and having side conversations. This is one way for House GOP leadership to buy more time to try to talk to holdouts and win them over since they can’t initiate a brief recess like they would typically be able to. That’s because the new House has not yet adopted formal rules to govern itself. The only option to take a formal break would be to have the entire chamber vote to adjourn, a more complicated option than just holding this vote open longer. Rep. Stephanie Bice, an ally of Johnson, said that Reps. Ralph Norman and Keith Self are meeting with Johnson now. They both voted for another lawmaker besides Johnson during the vote. She also said that they are holding the vote open in hopes that they can change Norman and Self’s votes, and still technically have Johnson elected “on the first ballot.” Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi slowly walked onto the floor of the US Capitol on Friday, weeks after undergoing surgery for a broken hip, as dozens of lawmakers cheered and offered her a standing ovation. Democrats cheered for her again when she stood up to cast a vote for Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries in the House’s tight-margin speaker’s race. Wearing a pair of flats instead of heels, she was seen holding herself up on a table to stand and speak with members before the first vote began. Pelosi, 84, underwent a “successful” hip replacement surgery after being admitted to a hospital in Luxembourg following a fall on the stairs, CNN previously reported. The US military medevacked the former House speaker from Luxembourg to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, according to a defense official. With House members instructed to return immediately for a second speaker vote, two of Speaker Mike Johnson’s key allies, Rep. Dusty Johnson and Bryan Steil, have been having an animated conversation with some of the Freedom Caucus members who have sought concessions from Johnson. Rep. Andy Harris, the group’s leader, spoke with Dusty Johnson for several minutes as the others looked on, with Harris repeatedly shaking his head. Meanwhile, several Republicans, including Reps. Steve Womack, Greg Murphy, Brian Fitzpatrick and Robert Aderholt ,approached Johnson on the floor after the first vote appeared to fail to offer handshakes and pats on the back. They appeared to be offering him words of encouragement, while some seemed frustrated, shaking their head at the result. While the first House speaker vote has not yet been called, Speaker Mike Johnson is on track to lose with the current breakdown, and the House is poised to go immediately into a second vote without a break. The House Democratic whip has sent a notice to members to return to the floor immediately to be ready for a second roll call vote. Multiple holdouts ultimately voted for House Speaker Mike Johnson in dramatic fashion, after initially skipping their turn in what appeared to be a short-lived protest of the speaker. Seven Republicans did not vote during the initial roll call: Reps. Andy Biggs, Andrew Clyde, Michael Cloud, Paul Gosar, Andy Harris and Chip Roy. Rep. Michael Waltz appeared to accidentally miss his turn. At the end of the roll call, all seven were given a final chance to vote and all seven voted for Johnson. One of the holdouts, Clyde, walked down the aisle to speak his vote directly to the clerk, carrying what appeared to be a Bible. One of Johnson’s whips in his speaker race, Rep. Dusty Johnson, was seen in an animated back-and-forth conversation with Roy in the back of the chamber. Rep. Dusty Johnson was also talking to Rep. Keith Self — who opposed Johnson on the floor — and Clyde. Johnson left the House chamber as it appeared likely he did not secure enough votes to keep his gavel on the first ballot. In the back of the chamber, many of the defectors continued to stand together quietly. The state of play: At this point, Johnson needs to flip Reps. Thomas Massie, Ralph Norman or Self — all who did not vote for Johnson. Further complicating matters, Norman and Self had not previously communicated their positions to the speaker, according to multiple GOP sources. Speaker Mike Johnson appears to be on track to lose the first round of voting for House speaker after losing support from at least three GOP members. Rep. Keith Self — also standing in the center of the aisle — voted for fellow Freedom Caucus member Byron Donalds. Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Rep. Ralph Norman of North Carolina also did not back Johnson, voting for Reps. Tom Emmer and Jim Jordan, respectively. Beyond the three GOP votes for other candidates, multiple Republicans initially abstained. Self has been standing near the other defections, though he has mostly been quiet and kept to himself. Another prior holdout, Rep. Victoria Spartz, voted for Johnson. Donalds told CNN ahead of the vote that lawmakers had approached him about whether he would be interested in running for speaker, but said he wasn’t entertaining the idea. Remember: Johnson could only afford a single GOP defection if every lawmaker shows up and votes. This post has been updated with additional details on the state of the vote. Republican Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina voted for Rep. Jim Jordan in the race for speaker of the House — making two GOP members who have voted against Mike Johnson. Rep. Thomas Massie also voted for someone else, throwing his support behind Rep. Tom Emmer. At least six Republican members so far have skipped their turn to vote, putting the chamber into suspense about whether Mike Johnson can secure the votes for speaker on the first ballot. Those members — GOP Reps. Andy Biggs, Andrew Clyde, Michael Cloud, Paul Gosar, Andy Harris and Chip Roy — all were silent when their names were called, though they will have another chance to vote at the end of the roll call. Keep in mind: As the vote was set to begin, GOP Rep. Tim Burchett vaguely predicted on X that the speaker contest would “go multiple rounds” but did not say how he planned to vote. Burchett had declined to tell reporters his position ahead of the vote, saying he was truly undecided and would “pray” on the decision. Scenes from the chamber: Biggs was standing next to Clyde and Harris — two other Freedom Caucus members who have not publicly committed to Johnson — as the clerk read his name. Biggs continued to stand, not moving or speaking, as his name was called. The next GOP member to be called, Rep. Sheri Biggs of South Carolina, voted for Johnson, who she declared to be “Trump’s endorsed candidate” — as other members in the chamber applauded. It is not clear if Gosar intentionally skipped his turn. He had been standing in the back of the chamber near fellow Freedom Caucus members Biggs and Harris. Harris intentionally chose not to vote. Two feet away from where Biggs and Burchett chatting, Harris stood silent in his spot at the back of the chamber as the clerk read his name several times. Burchett — who helped oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy — stood in the aisle, speaking to his close friend GOP Rep. Nancy Mace, as the roll call began. He then voted for Johnson. GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert also voted for Mike Johnson: “Don’t let us down Mr. Speaker,” she said as she cast her vote. Another previously undecided member, GOP Rep. Eric Burlison, also voted for Johnson on first ballot. CNN’s Manu Raju said “this is very much a strategic decision not to vote” from the members. “They are there and decided not to vote. So the question is, Dana, they’ll have a chance to vote at the end of this process. Will they vote yes or will they continue to hold out?” Raju told CNN’s Dana Bash. Track the House speaker vote here. This post has been updated with additional GOP members who skipped their turn. GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky did not vote for Mike Johnson for the House speakership, upholding his vow not to back Johnson. Johnson faces tough vote math with the narrowest House majority in nearly 100 years, leaving little room for error. Massie instead voted for GOP Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, the House majority whip who expressed confidence earlier Friday that Johnson will hold on to the gavel. As majority whip, Emmer has experience with keeping the GOP’s narrow majority in line. In January 2023, Emmer helped hammer out the negotiations between the 20 hardliners and the speaker’s office that eventually won former Speaker Kevin McCarthy the gavel after 15 ballots, according to former Republican Rep. Patrick McHenry. Following McCarthy’s historic ouster, Emmer sought the speakership himself, eventually withdrawing his bid, which paved the way for Johnson to clinch the post. The House is voting now to elect its speaker, as Rep. Mike Johnson is vying to retain the gavel. He faces tough vote math with the narrowest House majority in nearly 100 years, leaving little room for error. Johnson, who was backed by President-elect Donald Trump, can only afford a single GOP defection if every lawmaker shows up and votes, and one House Republican — Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky — has already said he won’t vote for him. How many votes are needed for Johnson to win: To be elected speaker, a candidate must win a majority of votes out of all votes cast. If all 435 members of the House vote, then a majority is 218 votes. There is expected to be one vacancy when the House convenes for the vote. Former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida has said he won’t take the seat he was elected to in the new Congress. That leaves 434 members with 219 Republicans and 215 Democrats. If all 434 vote, it takes 218 to win. Track the House speaker vote here. As GOP Rep. Lisa McClain formally nominated Speaker Mike Johnson, most of the Republican conference gave him a standing ovation. But several House Republicans — Reps. Tim Burchett, Andy Biggs and Eli Crane — remained seated through the speech and the standing ovation, though they were still seen clapping, at times, for Johnson from their seats. Democratic Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, who is the Democratic caucus chair, is delivering a nominating speech for Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries for speaker. The nomination comes as House Speaker Mike Johnson faces a critical vote soon in his attempts to retain the speakership. “There is only one leader who understands the needs of the working people and has lived the American dream himself, and is committed to ensuring its promise for future generations,” Aguilar said. “There is only one leader who knows how to negotiate a bipartisan deal and then stick to that deal. House Democrats are united behind the most powerful legislative leader in this chamber, Hakeem Jeffries of Brooklyn.” Aguilar vowed to work with the upcoming administration, while highlighting the importance of House Democrats in passing legislation. “We will work with the incoming administration to make life better, safer and more affordable for working families,” Aguilar said. GOP Rep. Lisa McClain of Michigan nominated Rep. Mike Johnson for House speaker. Johnson, the current speaker, is looking to keep the gavel. Johnson was endorsed by President-elect Donald Trump, but he could be presented with a challenge given the narrow House GOP majority. Republicans are set to take over control of the House and the Senate. McClain, who is the party’s conference chair, said this — with Johnson as speaker — gives lawmakers the opportunity to “put America first again.” McClain defended Johnson, saying, “None of us will get exactly what we want.” “Over 14 months ago, Mike Johnson took on a daunting task. No speaker is perfect and no one will ever be. However, achieving perfection requires incremental gains and hard decisions along the way,” she said, calling on Republicans to rally around Johnson. McClain also defended Johnson’s principles and values, saying he “knows our brightest days are still ahead of us” and expressed confidence that Johnson will “lead us through another successful Republican majority.” This post has been updated with additional remarks. Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson of Georgia was not present during the quorum call, but has arrived, according to a Democratic source. He will be able to vote for House speaker. Why this is key: This means that the expected majority threshold will be 218 and Johnson will only be able to lose one GOP vote against him if all other lawmakers vote. Senators were sworn in alphabetically, in groups, by Vice President Kamala Harris, and then signed the oath book. Some were escorted by former senators from their state, or by the outgoing senator who they were replacing. Sen. Bernie Moreno of Ohio was escorted by Vice President-elect JD Vance. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice was not sworn in to the Senate today. He announced on December 26 that he will remain the governor of his state until next week, when Governor-elect Patrick Morrisey is sworn in. In an apparent bid to win over detractors ahead of the speaker vote, House Speaker Mike Johnson posted to X that he will set up a working group for spending and government reform, among other commitments. This appears to be in response to demands from GOP Rep. Victoria Spartz and other GOP holdouts. Johnson’s vow does not include any specific commitments on legislation on the floor or committee rosters. He has repeatedly said he would not make private deals to win votes. Johnson’s public commitment comes as several undecided GOP members have been getting into line behind the speaker in the minutes before the vote. And Spartz posted to X in response to Johnson’s post saying, “I appreciate @SpeakerJohnson’s public commitment to the American people to deliver on President Trump’s agenda and drain the swamp.” Vice President Kamala Harris has called for the Senate to come to order, as the 119th Congress opens on Friday. Former senators, current senators and soon-to-be senators flooded the chamber on Friday, including former Majority Leader Trent Lott, and former Sens. Rob Portman, Dean Heller, and Bob Corker. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer shook hands with incoming Senate Republican Leader John Thune just before Chaplain Barry Black led the Senate in prayer. Black is returning to the Senate for the first time since he suffered a brain bleed last month. Ahead of the Senate being called to order, senators milled about and caught up with current and former colleagues. When now former-Sen. Tom Carper introduced Sen. Mitch McConnell to Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester, McConnell shook her hand warmly and told her, “I hope you learn to love the Senate.” Thune also huddled with McConnell on the floor for a few minutes before the proceedings. GOP Rep. Tim Burchett said he thinks voting for speaker of the House will go into multiple rounds. “I think it doesn’t really matter what I, what I’m going to do. I think you’ll see members pass, and then we’ll go into another round,” he said. Burchett would not disclose which members have told him how they are voting or how he would vote but did say some are still going vote no. As lawmakers enter the chamber ahead of the speaker’s vote, at least two House Republicans who had raised concerns about Mike Johnson now tell CNN they will support him. GOP Rep. Eli Crane told CNN he will be supporting Johnson because President-elect Donald Trump backs him, indicating that Trump’s endorsement has a lot of weight. “I’m going to support the president,” Crane told CNN, confirming that meant he would support Johnson. GOP Rep. Greg Steube also told CNN he will support Johnson as he walked onto the floor. There are still a number of holdouts who have not said publicly how they will vote, but Crane and Steube are an early indication that Republicans could fall in line and keep Johnson as their speaker. Remember: To be elected speaker, a candidate must win a majority of votes out of all votes cast. There is one vacancy expected when the House convenes — with former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz saying he won’t take the seat he was elected to in the new Congress — leaving 434 members, with 219 Republicans and 215 Democrats. If all 434 vote, it takes 218 to win. Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky has already said he won’t vote for Johnson, appearing to leave no further room for error. A packed House chamber was buzzing in anticipation Friday as new and returning members greeted each other ahead of the speaker’s vote. Many brought their families, with at least two dozen babies and kids, some clutching teddy bears, seen in the chamber. Speaker Mike Johnson personally waved hello to a group of young children in the well of the chamber shortly after he entered. Several of Johnson’s holdouts huddled near the back of the chamber. This includes Rep. Chip Roy, Andy Ogles, Eli Crane, Andrew Clyde and Scott Perry. Many of them are seated together. As expected, Democrats have full attendance, according to a leadership source. As former Speaker Nancy Pelosi slowly walked onto the floor weeks after her hip surgery, dozens of Democrats cheered and offered her a standing ovation. House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters ahead of the speaker’s vote that he believes he has the votes to hold onto his job and said he plans to stick it out even if it takes multiple rounds. “I think we are there. We’ll find out very soon” Johnson said when asked about the whip count. Johnson brushed off the idea that he couldn’t clinch the votes on the first round, telling reporters, “It says nothing it’s part of the process but I expect we’ll will get it done.” Johnson said President-elect Donald Trump has been helpful as he has tried to win over House Republicans. “Well you’ve seen his public statements, I think privately he’s talked with members,” Johnson said. Vowing to stick it out, regardless of how many rounds of voting it takes, Johnson said, “We have to get this job done and unify the Congress. And I’m here for the long haul.” Johnson reiterated that he hasn’t made any side deals with lawmakers to secure their votes: “I have made no deals with anyone. And I’m very proud to say that.” GOP Rep. Steve Womack warned on Friday morning of the stakes if the House GOP conference fails to quickly elect Mike Johnson to be speaker. “There will be many an opportunity over the course of the next several months as we prosecute an agenda to stumble, shoot ourselves in the foot. We can’t rely on help from the left so we’ve got to carry this on our own,” he told CNN. He said Republicans have a chance to project unity today by electing Johnson in one round of votes. “Put it in the bank and move on to our legislative agenda,” he said. Pressed by Raju on what message it would send if it takes more than one round of votes to select a speaker, Womack answered “that we’re not ready to govern. That the people of America have given us this opportunity and that we’re not prepared for it.” CNN has reported Johnson’s team has been growing increasingly optimistic that he’ll ultimately get the necessary votes and believe conversations with holdouts are headed in the right direction. Central to their argument is the need to be able to quickly certify the election and execute on Trump’s agenda, especially with a narrow margin. GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who is currently the sole public “no” vote against House Speaker Mike Johnson, said if one other member votes against him, it will “embolden half a dozen more” in a second vote. “I’d say there’s a 70% chance Mike Johnson is going to be speaker, that everybody but me will eventually vote for him, even though they know he’s the wrong guy, because that’s just the way the swamp works,” Massie told host Steve Deace on “The Glenn Beck Program.” “If one more person joins me, I think that will embolden half a dozen more. And I think the second round he loses more votes. The third round he loses more votes. President Trump calls him up, says Mike, I thought you were the guy, turns out you’re not the guy, step out of the way,” he said. “I think Mike will keep trying until Trump tells him to give up,” he added. Trump has publicly endorsed Johnson, and allies have indicated he won’t have patience for a dragged out process. Massie said that if Johnson fails to keep the gavel, Republicans could elect a new speaker tonight or over the weekend, saying “there are at least three qualified candidates.” “I’m not going anywhere. I have plans to stay here this weekend. We’re going to be right back here on Monday,” the Kentucky lawmaker said. Massie declined to name the alternative candidates he would support, but rejected the notion that Johnson is the only one who can earn support of 218 members. “Given that I’m a lightning rod, I don’t want to transfer that lightning to a candidate, and then they’ll be ‘persona non grata’ and be disqualified by virtue of me calling their name right here on your radio show,” Massie said. “It’s ridiculous to say that Mike Johnson, out of 219 Republicans is the only one who can be elected to speaker and that’s why we should elect him.” The new Congress will start at noon ET on January 3, and the first major item of business in the House is to elect a speaker. This happens before members are even sworn in. Before voting can start, candidates must be nominated. GOP Rep. Lisa McClain of Michigan is expected to give a nominating speech for Johnson, and Democratic Rep. Pete Aguilar of California is expected to give a nominating speech for House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries. But any member can nominate anyone, so additional candidates could be nominated. During the vote, a clerk will call on members by name in alphabetical order and each will have the chance to say which candidate they support. This is also when members could opt to say “present” instead of voting for a candidate. At the end, any members who did not vote will be given the opportunity to do so, and if any member wants to change their vote, they can. How many votes Johnson needs to win: Mike Johnson is vying to retain the gavel and has President-elect Donald Trump’s endorsement, but he faces tough vote math with the narrowest House majority in nearly 100 years, leaving little room for error. Johnson can only afford a single GOP defection if every lawmaker shows up and votes, and one House Republican. To be elected speaker, a candidate must win a majority of votes out of all votes cast. If all 435 members of the House vote, then a majority is 218 votes. There is expected to be one vacancy when the House convenes for the vote. Former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida has said he won’t take the seat he was elected to in the new Congress. That leaves 434 members with 219 Republicans and 215 Democrats. If all 434 vote, it takes 218 to win. Johnson’s allies are projecting confidence he’ll be able to secure the speakership, but even they are bracing for the possibility that it could go into multiple rounds of voting, leading to a drawn-out floor fight. House Speaker Mike Johnson and his allies have been increasingly optimistic throughout the morning on Friday, as no other GOP lawmakers, besides Rep. Thomas Massie, have communicated to the speaker’s office they will definitively oppose him on the floor, according to multiple GOP sources. While Republican leadership is not ruling out potential drama given the historically narrow margins for securing the speakership, there is rising confidence Johnson will secure the gavel by the end of day Friday. Even one of Johnson’s holdouts — GOP Rep. Andy Ogles — predicted that Johnson would keep his gavel on Friday, and the only question was how many ballots it would take. The upbeat tone is notable from Ogles, who said he will not publicly reveal whether he plans to support Johnson on the floor. “I think Mike’s gonna be fine,” the Tennessee lawmaker said. “It just depends if it’s gonna be one or three” ballots. Ogles, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, is among a group of members pushing for commitments from Johnson in the 119th Congress. Asked about his personal priorities, Ogles said he wants Congress to pay for any emergency spending, such as natural disaster relief or international aid. “I’d say one of the biggest things is any supplemental, there needs to be a pay-for,” Ogles said. Republican Rep. Jim Jordan exuded optimism about the vote, saying he thought it would take one ballot. “I think so, I think probably Thomas is, as far as I know, Thomas is the only ‘no’ vote,” he said, referring to Massie. Remember: To be elected speaker, a candidate must win a majority of votes out of all votes cast. There is one vacancy expected when the House convenes — with former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz saying he won’t take the seat he was elected to in the new Congress — leaving 434 members, with 219 Republicans and 215 Democrats. If all 434 vote, it takes 218 to win. This post has been updated with additional details. New Senate Majority Leader John Thune will stress his commitment to preserving the 60 votes threshold to overcome a filibuster on legislation, according to excerpts provided by his office from his maiden speech expected to be delivered on the floor at about 1 p.m. ET. “And one of my priorities as leader will be to ensure that the Senate stays the Senate,” the Republican from South Dakota will say. “That means preserving the legislative filibuster – the Senate rule that today has perhaps the greatest impact in preserving the Founders’ vision of the Senate.” Remember: President-elect Donald Trump and Senate Democrats have pushed to weaken the filibuster for bills as has already happened for nominations and Thune could face pressure from Trump to ditch it if Democrats are able to block bills on the floor. “It also means restoring the Senate as a place of discussion and deliberation,” Thune will say. Below are additional excerpts from his speech highlighting his priorities in the new Congress: “That includes empowering committees, restoring regular order, and engaging in extended debate on the Senate floor, where all members should have a chance to make their voices – and the voices of their constituents – heard.” Walking into House Speaker Mike Johnson’s office moments ago, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer was confident Johnson has the votes to keep the gavel. “Yep, oh yeah,” the Minnesota Republican said, when asked by CNN. To be elected speaker, Johnson must win a majority of votes out of all votes cast. There is expected to be one vacancy when the House convenes for the vote. Former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida has said he won’t take the seat he was elected to in the new Congress. That leaves 434 members with 219 Republicans and 215 Democrats. If all 434 vote, it takes 218 to win. Johnson can only afford a single GOP defection if every lawmaker shows up and votes, and one House Republican — Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky — has already said he won’t vote for him, while roughly a dozen more have not committed to supporting him. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice will not be sworn in to the US Senate today. According to an announcement released over the holidays, he has decided to delay his swearing in until after Governor-elect Patrick Morrissey is sworn in, in order to preserve the “continuity of government.” Morrisey will be sworn in on January 13. GOP Sen. Shelley Moore Capito praised Justice’s decision, saying in a statement: “I very much respect Governor Justice’s decision to honor his commitment to complete his term as Governor of the State of West Virginia.” “I am looking forward to serving with Senator Justice as there is much to do to advance President Trump’s agenda on behalf of all West Virginians,” she added. Given that decision, 99 senators will be sworn in this week, not 100. Rep. Mark Amodei, a Republican from Nevada who backs House Speaker Mike Johnson, tells CNN he predicts a few rounds of voting in the speaker’s race today but ultimately believes Johnson will prevail — if for no other reason than Republicans know what a drawn-out contest can cost the party. “Just the nature of this. So that’s fine. It will take two or three,” he said of his prediction for how many rounds it takes for Johnson to win. Amodei warns that President-elect Donald Trump won’t be patient with members who want to drag this out. He believes Trump’s influence could go a long way to shoring up support for Johnson. “Nobody comes to mind,” he said, when asked if there was someone better for the job. “I think his demeanor is something that is an absolute benefit,” he said, adding “there is no heir apparent.” “Finding an heir apparent would be phenomenally time-consuming — we know from experience — so therefore, at the end of the day, I think he’s your guy.” He also warned against making GOP Rep. Chip Roy — a holdout who has publicly criticized Johnson — the Rules Committee chairman, an idea that has been floated by some members of the conference, arguing he hasn’t proven to be a cooperative member on the committee so far, as he often votes against rules. Ahead of today’s House speaker vote, President-elect Donald Trump praised Mike Johnson to CNN and indicated that he is confident that Johnson will be successful. “I think the speaker will do very well. He’s a fine man. He’s a very fine individual, he’s religious, he’s smart, he’s strong. Everybody likes him. Everybody respects him,” Trump said in a brief phone interview. The president-elect confirmed CNN’s reporting that he had been in touch with Republican holdouts, including GOP Rep. Chip Roy. When asked what he was telling these Republicans, Trump said he wasn’t “telling them anything.” “I’m just saying, Look, we had the greatest presidential election. We won the popular vote by millions of votes. We had a great, we had a great election, and it would be nice to cement the election with an election here. I mean, that would just be a big, beautiful exclamation point,” he said. When asked specifically about his conversations with Roy, Trump noted that he thought “Chip Roy will do what’s right for the country” and said he would be watching the vote today. In an indication that he is all in for Johnson, Trump said there was no one else he was eyeing for speaker at this time should it not work out, reiterating that he thinks Johnson will be successful. The 119th Congress begins today, ushering in a new era of Republican control in Washington that will start with a high-stakes leadership fight to pick the next House speaker. Mike Johnson is vying to retain the gavel and has President-elect Donald Trump’s endorsement, but he faces tough vote math with the narrowest House majority in nearly 100 years, leaving little room for error. Johnson can only afford a single GOP defection if every lawmaker shows up and votes, and one House Republican — Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky — has already said he won’t vote for him, while roughly a dozen more have not committed to supporting him. Looming over the race is the question of what happens if the House has not yet elected a speaker by Monday, January 6, the day lawmakers are supposed to count electoral votes and finalize the results of the presidential election — a scenario that would put Congress into unprecedented territory. How many votes to win? To be elected speaker, a candidate must win a majority of votes out of all votes cast. If all 435 members of the House vote, then a majority is 218 votes. There is expected to be one vacancy when the House convenes for the vote. Former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida has said he won’t take the seat he was elected to in the new Congress. That leaves 434 members with 219 Republicans and 215 Democrats. If all 434 vote, it takes 218 to win. But if any members do not vote or vote “present” — which is not really a vote at all — the number needed to win can go down. That’s because absences and “present” votes do not count toward the overall total used to calculate the majority threshold. A defiant Speaker Mike Johnson said he is unwilling to “make deals” with fellow Republicans to secure votes, taking a dramatically different strategy than his predecessor Kevin McCarthy just hours before the vote to secure the gavel. “My simple message to my colleagues is, make suggestions about process improvements, we’re open to that at all times. But I don’t make deals with anyone. There’s no quid for pro here. I don’t do anything in exchange for a vote,” Johnson said to reporters outside his office. The Louisiana Republican is making clear that he will not engage in side deals – such as the suggestion from some conservatives that one holdout, GOP Rep. Chip Roy, should take over the powerful House Rules Committee. In recent days, the speaker has been having conversations with the roughly half dozen GOP holdouts about process deforms – such as voting on single-issue spending bills or reforming the suspension calendar. The Freedom Caucus, in particular, has a list of demands related to cutting spending and chamber processes. But Johnson insists he will not be making specific commitments, marking a wholly different approach than McCarthy. If he succeeds, it would leave Johnson without the tradeoffs that McCarthy made to secure his gavel two years ago – which ultimately weakened him enough to coat McCarthy his gavel. Instead, Johnson is making the argument that backing him for speaker will mean supporting President-elect Donald Trump. “I’m talking with all members and telling them we need to unify so we can move the Trump agenda,” Johnson told reporters. Speaker Mike Johnson will face a major challenge in the new Congress – the narrowest House majority in nearly 100 years. That is, if he can keep the gavel. Republicans will soon control the House, Senate and White House. But thin margins could imperil President-elect Donald Trump’s agenda. And Johnson has little room for error when the House votes on Friday to elect a speaker for the new Congress. Republicans won 220 House seats in the November elections, while Democrats won 215, the most narrowly divided House majority since the outset of the Great Depression, almost a century ago. And the margin is set to quickly shrink even further. When the House convenes, the partisan breakdown is expected to be 219 to 215 since former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida has said he’s not returning to Congress. From there, the majority is on track to drop to 217 to 215 with two GOP lawmakers expected to join the Trump administration. At that point, House Republicans would not be able to afford a single defection to pass legislation along party lines until the vacancies are filled. Read the full story here. A new batch of lawmakers will be sworn in today and many of them are making history. Both parties are set to welcome a diverse group of newly elected lawmakers in Congress. Arizona: Democrat Ruben Gallego will be the first Latino senator from Arizona. Yassamin Ansari will be the first Iranian American Democrat elected to Congress, succeeding Gallego in Arizona’s 3rd Congressional District. California: Democrat Derek Tran will be the first Vietnamese American elected to Congress from California. Delaware: Democrat Lisa Blunt Rochester will be the first Black and first female senator from Delaware. Democrat Sarah McBride will be the first transgender member of Congress. McBride will also be the first out LGBTQ person elected to Congress from Delaware. Maryland: Democrat Angela Alsobrooks will be the first Black senator from Maryland, succeeding retiring Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin. Alsobrooks and Delaware’s Rochester being elected to the Senate will mark the first time that two Black women have served simultaneously in the chamber. New Jersey: Democrat Andy Kim will be the first Korean American elected to the US Senate. Democrat Nellie Pou will be the first Latina elected to Congress from New Jersey. North Dakota: Republican Julie Fedorchak will be the first woman elected to the US House from North Dakota. Ohio: Republican Bernie Moreno will be the first Latino senator from Ohio.

Read about more history-makers joining Congress here. Republican lawmakers are weighing in ahead of the vote for speaker of the House, as Mike Johnson fights to hold on to his job. Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan told Fox News “I think so,” when asked if he thinks Johnson will have the votes to remain speaker in today’s vote. Jordan said House Republicans need to get past the speaker vote to “do what we told the American people we were going to do.” Meanwhile, Louisiana GOP Rep. Mark Green predicted on Friday on “CBS Mornings” that the speaker vote today “will come down to a razor wire finish.” “People are out there negotiating,” Green said. “When we have a super thin majority, it’s really tough to get a speaker elected, as we saw last Congress.” When asked if he thought any of his other colleagues besides Johnson would want the job, Green responded “most of the folks I talk to that are super confident would not want the job, especially with this majority,” adding “this is the toughest job in America, I am convinced of that.” Tennessee GOP Rep. Tim Burchett told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” he’s still undecided on whether he’ll vote for Johnson as speaker, stating “I’ll be praying about it and I’ll make my decision according to that.” “Mike’s in a really tough position. Anybody in that position outside of being a single mom I can’t think of any job tougher in this country than being speaker of the House,” Burchett said, acknowledging Johnson’s balancing act between conservative members and members from swing districts. House speaker elections on Friday are less about Mike Johnson and more about Donald Trump. Johnson’s frantic fight to hold onto his job was still a cliffhanger heading into a fateful day for Republicans. But the president-elect has even more on the line – nothing less than his push for a fast start to his second presidency and promise to deliver massive change. If Trump fails to lift Johnson over the line, he will sow new doubts about his capacity to effectively lead the GOP trifecta of power in the House, Senate and White House. The convening of the 119th Congress, therefore, represents the first day of Washington’s new Trump era with Republicans aiming to produce tangible results as soon as he steps back into the Oval Office on January 20. The nation’s new leaders plan sweeping overhauls of immigration policy and big tax cuts using complex maneuvers required to overcome Democratic filibusters in the Senate. Such moves will demand unity and political dexterity for which the House GOP is hardly renowned. But before they can do anything, House Republicans must elect a speaker, an often routine task that is deeply perilous for Johnson because of the tiny majority that means he can lose only one vote in his fractious party if every lawmaker turns up. If Republicans can’t select a speaker by Monday, they won’t even be able to initiate the congressional process to certify Trump’s election victory — a spectacle that would be sure to infuriate and embarrass the president-elect. Read the full analysis. House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan told CNN that he believes GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky could be the only person willing to vote against House Speaker Mike Johnson on the floor on Friday. “The only ‘no’ right now is Thomas and I think it may stay that way,” Jordan, a Republican from Ohio, told CNN. Asked about his message to the holdouts, Jordan stressed that GOP unity in the speaker’s race would allow the party to enact President-elect Donald Trump’s agenda. “The best way for us to accomplish what the people elected us to do is to get after it right away. The best way to get that done is to make sure Mike’s speaker and get moving,” Jordan said. Jordan didn’t rule out supporting process reforms that some of the holdouts are seeking from Johnson. “I’ve got to see all the details on that,” Jordan said when asked about reforms such as changes to the suspension calendar. “That’s largely between the speaker and the members. It’s all about getting the votes and getting down to work.” With the start of the 119th Congress on Friday, GOP Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina will become the longest-serving Black senator in the United States. Scott will also serve as the first Black chairman of a Senate standing committee, leading the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, where he previously served as Ranking Member. “As we begin the 119th Congress, Senate Republicans have high enthusiasm and are focused on delivering for the American people! This Congress, I am thrilled to serve as the Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee,” Scott said in a statement to CNN. He continued, “My goal is simple: make America work for Americans. As we get to work cleaning up the mess from the previous administration, I look forward to working with President Trump on his priorities, including paving a path for all Americans to have the necessary tools and resources to achieve their version of the American Dream. We will unlock opportunity, strengthen our nation, and make America the shining city on the Hill again.” Scott is one of only 12 Black senators to serve in the United States Senate. Currently, Scott is the only Black Republican in the Senate, while there are two Black Democratic senators: Sen. Cory Booker and Sen. Raphael Warnock. Two Black Democratic Senators, Sens.-elect Angela Alsobrooks and Lisa Blunt Rochester, will also be sworn in Friday. President-elect Donald Trump took to social media to post in support of Speaker Mike Johnson ahead of today’s critical speakership vote. “Good luck today for Speaker Mike Johnson, a fine man of great ability, who is very close to having 100% support. A win for Mike today will be a big win for the Republican Party, and yet another acknowledgment of our 129 year most consequential Presidential Election!! - A BIG AFFIRMATION, INDEED. MAGA!” Trump posted. Remember: Trump endorsed Johnson earlier this week, though the Republican from Louisiana faces a tough fight to retain the gavel, highlighting a test of the president-elect’s influence over his party amid the limits of an extraordinarily narrow majority. Trump’s endorsement could help Johnson shore up support, especially after the speaker navigated a chaotic government funding fight earlier this month that drew the ire of his right flank. But with a historically small majority in the new Congress, Johnson can afford only a single Republican defection when the House picks a new speaker if every member votes. House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters he hopes to win on one ballot today, even as multiple GOP lawmakers remain uncommitted. “I think so,” Johnson said, when asked by reporters if he expected to win on the first ballot. When pressed on if he’d be willing to make Republican Rep. Chip Roy the rules committee chairman, something members of the hardline House Freedom Caucus have been pushing, Johnson was definitive saying he is “not making side deals with anybody.” House lawmakers will vote today on whether to re-elect Johnson as their majority leader. Johnson’s allies are projecting confidence he’ll be able to secure the speakership, but even they are bracing for the possibility that it could go into multiple rounds of voting, leading to a drawn-out floor fight. Johnson can only afford a single GOP defection if every lawmaker shows up and votes, and one House Republican - Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky - has already said he won’t vote for him, while roughly a dozen more have not committed to supporting him. This post has been updated with additional details. Mike Johnson has been engaged in a flurry of talks with GOP hardliners who have made a series of demands as they hold out their support ahead of Friday’s critical vote to elect the next speaker. But unlike Kevin McCarthy, who won the gavel in 2023 after a 15-ballot marathon following a furious round of horse-trading, Johnson is resisting cutting side-deals to secure the speakership, according to his allies. The speaker is “not inclined to negotiate or make backroom-side deals,” a leadership source told CNN. Whether that posture changes remains to be seen since Johnson’s allies are uncertain whether he can win the speakership on the first ballot on Friday. Many of the decisions on what — if any — deals need to be cut will be made once vote-counting begins and the speaker and his team get a clear sense of which Republicans are withholding their support. So far, Rep. Thomas Massie is the lone Republican to announce his opposition to Johnson, who can’t afford to lose any more Republicans assuming all House members in attendance back a specific candidate. But others are expressing serious reservations, such as Reps. Chip Roy and Victoria Spartz, while a handful of other members remain non-committal. If Johnson fails to win on the first vote, the House could proceed to a second vote immediately after. If Johnson fails again on a second ballot, it’s uncertain if they’d try to recess the chamber to hold private meetings over how to proceed since the House cannot legislate until a speaker is selected. They could also decide to continue to vote on the floor. Among the demands hardliners are making including commitments on how government funding bills will be handled, assurances that new spending will be offset with cuts, further changes to a new House rules package, and the ability to have more sway in the legislative process. Beginning at 12 p.m. ET on January 3, the new Congress begins with a series of formalities in the House of Representatives. Below are key highlights of what to expect: Initial order of events in the House: How the speaker election works: If Johnson is elected on the first ballot If Johnson is not elected on the first ballot President-elect Donald Trump said on Monday that Speaker Mike Johnson has his “complete” and “total” endorsement, a major boost for the top House Republican ahead of the critical vote Friday. Trump’s endorsement comes as some House conservatives have warned they are not committed to backing Johnson in the speaker’s race. The President-elect’s endorsement could help Johnson lock down the votes he will need, especially after he navigated a chaotic government funding fight earlier this month that drew the ire of some members of his right flank. But Johnson faces an extraordinary narrow margin and can only lose a single Republican vote to still win the gavel, leaving little room for error. Trump praised Johnson on Monday, saying he is “hard working” and “will do the right thing.” “The American people need IMMEDIATE relief from all of the destructive policies of the last Administration. Speaker Mike Johnson is a good, hard working, religious man. He will do the right thing, and we will continue to WIN. Mike has my Complete & Total Endorsement. MAGA!!!,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. More context: After Johnson cut a deal with Democrats over spending in mid-December, Trump injected a last-minute demand to raise the debt ceiling that left Johnson grasping for a plan B. A revised GOP plan ultimately failed to get enough Republican votes to pass and caused grumbling among Johnson’s right flank that the speaker wasn’t up to the job. It also caused some to wonder if Trump would stick with Johnson ahead of the speaker fight. Republican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota will be the next leader of his party in the chamber and the key ally of Mitch McConnell will be tasked with shepherding the agenda of President-elect Donald Trump through Congress. In choosing Thune — who has served as minority whip, the No. 2 role in GOP Senate leadership — Republicans elevated a leader associated with the establishment wing of the party over Florida Sen. Rick Scott, who was championed by several prominent Trump allies, including Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy and Tucker Carlson. The election was conducted by secret ballot, which might have allowed Republicans wary of offending Trump’s most ardent supporters some political protection. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, another McConnell ally, also vied for the leadership post. Thune, won the vote — which was conducted in November — 29-24 in the second round of voting against Cornyn and he will be sworn in on January 3. McConnell, who has led Senate Republicans since 2007, announced in February that he would step down as GOP leader this year. Immediately, Thune will be swept into a controversy brewing over Trump’s demand that the upper chamber use recess appointments to install his nominees, bypassing the formal advice and consent confirmation process, which historically has allowed the minority party to block a president’s picks. The three Republican senators who vied for majority leader all publicly supported Trump’s demand following his election victory. Thune, 63, has had a complicated relationship with the president-elect. He called for Trump to drop out of the 2016 race in the wake of the infamous “Access Hollywood” scandal — though Thune later said he still planned to vote for Trump. And he condemned Trump’s actions surrounding the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot as indefensible. Still, when Trump faced a vote in the Senate following his impeachment over the incident, Thune sided with McConnell and most of the Republican caucus in voting “not guilty.” Read more about Thune. © 2025 Cable News Network.

                "title": "Mike Johnson wins full term as House speaker after two Republicans change their votes: Highlights",
                "content": "Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Sahil Kapur Speaker Mike Johnson told NBC News this evening that House Republicans will move a budget resolution in “early January” and start crafting party-line legislation to advance Trump’s agenda. “We’re already working on it,” he said. But he didn’t say whether they’ll pursue one bill or two through the reconciliation process. “Stay tuned. I’ll let you know,” he said. Syedah Asghar Sarah Mimms The House passed its new rules for the 119th Congress tonight on a vote of 215-209. The package will make it harder for opponents to oust Johnson in the middle of the term. The rules raise the threshold to remove a speaker from office from just one member last Congress to nine members of the majority party (in this case Republicans). The rules do not include language from Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., backed by Johnson, to ban transgender women from using female bathrooms in the Capitol. Mace has said that her effort “absolutely” was meant to target freshman Rep. Sarah McBride, D-Del., who was elected in November and is now the first openly transgender member of Congress. Mace has repeatedly misgendered McBride while pushing for the ban. McBride has called the effort “a blatant attempt from far right-wing extremists to distract from the fact that they have no real solutions to what Americans are facing.” Trump himself recently told Time magazine that he agreed with McBride that, as Time phrased it, “we should all be focused on more important issues.\" Mace said last year she hoped the ban would be included in the Rules package. Asked about the omission, Mace said it is already “House policy,” referring to Johnson’s statement in November that “all single-sex facilities in the Capitol and House Office Buildings — such as restrooms, changing rooms, and locker rooms — are reserved for individuals of that biological sex.” When pressed, Mace said that she plans to re-introduce legislation to try to codify that policy this Congress. Brennan Leach Julie Tsirkin Reporting from The U.S. House Asked how he flipped GOP holdouts to win the speakership, Johnson said he assured his colleagues that the conference will operate under “member-driven” leadership. “I’ve been aiming to decentralize the speaker’s office’s power since I first had the gavel. We’ll continue that,\" he told reporters. \"We want to be member-driven and empower the chairs of our committees and all of that.” Johnson also praised Trump as “the most powerful president, certainly of the modern era, maybe in all of American history” and added that his endorsement was a “big factor in this.” Asked if he would have Trump’s support over the next two years, Johnson said, “yes.” On whether he will remain speaker during that time, Johnson said, “100%, yes.” Henry J. Gomez After attending the swearings-in of new senators today, Vice President-elect JD Vance went in for a “long-planned” surgery, a spokesperson for his team told NBC News. “The Vice President-elect is having long-planned, minor sinus surgery and will be back to work tomorrow,” William Martin said in a statement. Fox News first reported on the planned procedure. Vance, until he resigns to take office as vice president, remains a senator from Ohio. He briefly will be the state's senior senator, following the swearing-in today of fellow Republican Bernie Moreno, who defeated Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown in November. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine will appoint Vance's successor. Kyle Stewart Syedah Asghar Raquel Coronell Uribe Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., fell down a marble staircase outside the House chamber but is OK, according to a spokesperson from Foxx’s office. Foxx, who is 81, slipped while walking down the staircase after walking up to talk to her family in the gallery. “After being helped to her feet, and looked over by medical personnel, she proceeded on her own to the Attending Physician’s office to get treated for a few individual cuts. Everything seems to be okay,” Alex Ives, a spokesperson for Foxx, said in a statement. Foxx confirmed she was “just fine” in a post on X. “Thank you to everyone for your prayers — just a few small cuts and I’m doing just fine,” Foxx wrote. “I’m a mountain woman, and we’re tougher than a $2 steak,” she added. Julie Tsirkin Frank Thorp Vproducer and off-air reporter Syedah Asghar Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., who initially voted against Johnson in the speaker race, talked about what flipped his vote to Johnson before the tally was announced. Norman told NBC News that Trump spoke on two calls before the vote was finalized. In the first one, Rep. Nancy Mace handed Norman the phone with Trump on the line, Norman said, adding that he “interrupted” Trump’s golf game. During the second Trump call, the phone was on speakerphone with Johnson, Norman and Rep. Keith Self, R-Texas, all present. Trump talked about the power of the GOP holding a trifecta via control over the White House and both chambers of Congress, Norman said. “You don’t get that opportunity,” Trump said, according to Norman. Norman also said that it was not Trump, but rather Johnson \"assuring\" him, that convinced him to switch his vote before the tabulation was finalized. Kyle Stewart Johnson said Trump’s support was a “big factor” in his election as speaker. “He wants us to unify as a conference and to get the job done and we must,” Johnson told reporters as he walked through the Capitol. Johnson reiterated that he made no promises to members in exchange for their support but “told them they can be assured that we’re going to have different processes and procedures this time around, because it’s unified government” with Republican control of the White House and both chambers of Congress. “We’re going to have a member-driven, bottom-up process for the development of this really important legislation,” Johnson said. “And we must succeed. We have no margin for error. So, that’s all it was. No promises, nothing.” Rep. Keith Self, of Texas, initially a Republican holdout who ultimately voted for Johnson, referred to those concerns in explaining his frustrations with Johnson's leadership. “I was very frustrated with the 118th Congress, and that’s why we needed to shore up the processes to make it more member-oriented for the Trump agenda, because we needed more input from members like myself, not a chairman, not a leadership position, and I think that’s what we have done,” Self said. But Trump himself has remained steadfast in his support of Johnson's speakership bid, congratulating Johnson after he won the gavel and saying he would make a \"Great Speaker.\" Alexandra Marquez Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., the incoming Senate majority leader, said today that Johnson will have “a really, really tough job,” navigating a narrow majority. “I think he has been responsive to his members, but he’s got a lot of folks that are headed in different directions,” Thune said during an interview with NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" moderator Kristen Welker that took place as the House was selecting a new speaker. “I mean, as you know, that with a narrow margin like that, any individual member of the House of Representatives can have a huge impact.” Thune also said that he and Johnson could have a “strong working relationship,” even though the two men haven’t worked closely before. Read the full story here. Alana Satlin The Senate will soon start considering Trump's Cabinet picks and other administration posts, with some expected to face tougher votes than others. Pete Hegseth, Trump's pick for defense secretary, has been embattled over concerns about his alcohol use and an allegation of sexual assault. Hegseth, an Army National Guard veteran and former Fox News host, called the allegations false and said last year he would stop drinking if confirmed by the Senate. Former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's pick for director of national intelligence, has also faced backlash over her comments on Russia and a secret visit to Syria to meet with its then-dictator Bashar al-Assad. Trump's first choice for attorney general, former Rep. Matt Gaetz, backed out after misconduct allegations against him resurfaced. He withdrew in November and Trump said he would nominate former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi instead. Bondi is expected to be confirmed. Some of Trump's other picks are likely to sail through the confirmation process, including Marco Rubio as secretary of state and Elise Stefanik as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Bridget Bowman Sen. John Curtis, R-Utah, said the new Republican-controlled Senate should move quickly to process Trump's Cabinet picks but also thoroughly vet them. \"I do think that we need to move quickly. That doesn’t mean we can be sloppy or that we won’t do our job,\" Curtis said today during a virtual press conference when asked about Senate Majority Leader John Thune's recent statement that the New Orleans terrorist attack underscored that Trump's national security teams should be quickly confirmed. \"Until I really have a chance to go through that entire process, I’m being careful to make any decisions myself until I have all the facts on every candidate,\" Curtis said. Curtis is a key senator to watch in the vetting process as he begins his first Senate term. He has not said whether he will back Trump's Cabinet choices, raising some concerns about Fox News host Pete Hegseth, Trump's pick for defense secretary, and Kash Patel, whom Trump has tapped to lead the FBI. Curtis noted he has met with both Hegseth and Patel and asked them \"really tough questions\" and is \"continuing to study them.\" Raquel Coronell Uribe Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., reacted to fellow Republican Keith Self of Texas casting a vote for him as speaker today, before backing Johnson. Donalds said he had not been expecting Self to vote for him instead of Johnson. “Did you think, ‘Oh heck no, we can’t go there?’ I’m just curious what that really felt like,” Donalds was asked on MSNBC. “That was basically my response. I’m not gonna go into all, everything, exactly what I said, but that was basically my response,” Donalds said. Donalds said Trump had been involved in swaying undecided House Republicans. “As I understand it, the president was involved. I think it speaks to his ability to talk directly with members, for them to kind of take a step back and look at everything that needs to be accomplished,” Donalds said. Alexandra Marquez Kyle Stewart In a letter signed by 11 members of the House Freedom Caucus that was released after the vote, the group outlined its demands for Johnson’s speakership, saying in part, “We voted for Mike Johnson for Speaker of the House because of our steadfast support of President Trump and to ensure the timely certification of his electors. We did this despite our sincere reservations regarding the Speaker’s track record over the past 15 months.” The demands included extending the House’s working calendar for this session, reversing several Biden administration policies “immediately” and ending stock trading by members of Congress. Frank Thorp Vproducer and off-air reporter Brennan Leach Rep. Keith Self, who originally voted for Rep. Byron Donalds to be speaker before switching his vote to Johnson, told reporters that he spoke with Trump over the phone “a couple of times today.” Self said that they shared a “lively discussion” but declined to elaborate further. Asked about his frustrations with Johnson’s leadership, Self said, “I was very frustrated with the 118th Congress, and that’s why we needed to shore up the processes to make it more member-oriented for the Trump agenda, because we needed more input from members like myself, not a chairman, not a leadership position, and I think that’s what we have done.” During the speaker vote, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., was photographed appearing to speak on the phone with incoming chief of staff Susie Wiles. Annemarie Bonner As the newly elected speaker, Johnson did a mass swearing of all of the members of the 119th Congress. He administered the oath of office and led all of the members at once. \"Congratulations, you are now members of the 119th Congress,\" Johnson said to end the procedure. Kyle Stewart With the election of the speaker, it has now started snowing in Washington, D.C. Kyle Stewart Johnson was just sworn in by Rep. Hal Rogers, R-Ky., dean of the House. The dean of the House is the longest-serving member: Rogers, 87, was elected in 1981. Syedah Asghar Raquel Coronell Uribe Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., made a motion of brushing off her shoulders at Johnson’s line about the Green New Deal: \"We have to ... pass legislation to eliminate the Green New Deal, that funding.\" Rebecca Shabad Johnson opened his remarks after being re-elected as House speaker by calling for a moment of silence to honor the victims affected by the terrorist attack in his home state of Louisiana on Wednesday. He then laid out GOP priorities in the new Congress, in tandem with the Trump White House. Johnson emphasized that the Republicans' goal is to implement an \"America First\" agenda. \"Sadly for the past four years of divided government, too many politicians in Washington have done the opposite. Open borders and over-regulation have destroyed our cities and stifled innovation,\" he said. \"Inflation and weak leadership have left Americans poorer and they have placed our country in a perilous position.\" Johnson said that Americans demand that officials put them first. \"It’s a coalition that insists that we purge the policies of America last and we bury them in the graveyard of history’s mistakes, because it was a big mistake,\" he said. The speaker said that the first issue to tackle is the nation's borders. \"That’s the number one priority,\" he said. \"In coordination with President Trump, this Congress will give our border and immigration enforcement agents the resources that they need to do their job, we will secure the border, we will deport dangerous criminal illegal aliens, and finally finish building the border wall.\" Johnson said that Republicans will also provide relief to Americans by extending the Trump tax cuts. Annemarie Bonner Syedah Asghar In a speech on the House floor, Jeffries took a dig at people who denied the 2020 election results. “It’s okay. There are no election deniers on our side of the aisle. One should love America when you win and when you lose,\" he said. \"That’s the patriotic thing to do, and that’s the America that House Democrats will fight hard to preserve, because we love this country. \" He also pledged that Democrats would fight hard to not have Social Security and Medicare benefits taken away. There was laughter from Republicans when Jeffries touched on border security and the Biden economy. Kyle Stewart Now that Mike Johnson has been re-elected as speaker, he will be escorted to the chair and give a speech after being sworn in. He will then swear in the members of the House. Annemarie Bonner Rep. Stephanie Bice, R-Okla., said in an interview on CNN that she believes that Johnson did not cut a deal with the two holdouts to win their support, but rather listened to their concerns. “That’s one of the things that Mike Johnson has done remarkably well, is listening to all of the concerns that members may have,\" she said. \"It’s a tough, I think, road to be thrown into this incredible responsibility, and he’s done a remarkable job, and part of that has been listening.\" Jiachuan Wu Syedah Asghar Kyle Stewart With a vote of 218-215, Johnson has officially been re-elected as speaker. Rep. Massie was the only Republican to vote for someone other than Johnson. Rebecca Shabad Kyle Stewart Syedah Asghar Reps. Keith Self, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C., who voted for other Republicans earlier in the voting process, just changed their votes to back Johnson. The switch likely gives Johnson the votes to become speaker. This switch happened after Johnson went to the cloakroom for discussions with Reps. Norman, Self, Perry, Harris, Higgins and Cloud. Annemarie Bonner Rep. Dale Strong, R-Ala., said in an interview on CNN that failing to elect a speaker on the first ballot is a setback for the Republican Party. \"It is absolutely setting us back. It's time to move. It's time to vote and put Mike Johnson as speaker of the House,\" Strong said. He emphasized the need to certify the election so that the GOP can tackle its priorities. Henry J. Gomez CLEVELAND — Ohio Lt. Gov. Jon Husted has emerged as a late and leading contender to succeed Vice President-elect JD Vance in the Senate, three Republicans familiar with the process said. Gov. Mike DeWine will appoint a replacement once Vance resigns his Senate seat — something that must happen before Vance and President-elect Donald Trump take office Jan. 20. What’s not yet clear is if Husted would accept an appointment, which would run through a special election in 2026 to fill the remaining two years of Vance’s term. But some GOP insiders believe the job is Husted’s if he wants it. Read the full story here. Alexandra Marquez Stacey Plaskett, a nonvoting Democratic delegate from the U.S. Virgin Islands, stood after the first roll-call vote to ask why delegates from the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia were not asked to vote for speaker. Plaskett said that the delegates represent \"collectively 4 million Americans\" and added, \"This body and this nation has a territory and a colonies problem,\" after the parliamentarian told her that delegates-elect were not eligible to vote for speaker. \"What should have been temporary has now effectively become permanent. We must do something about this,\" Plaskett said before the parliamentarian ceased to recognize her with time to speak. Rebecca Shabad Reps. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., and Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., just went to the well to vote for Johnson after choosing not to vote before. Rep. Andy Biggs also cast a voice vote for Johnson. Rebecca Shabad Johnson appears not to have the votes after several defections. The vote count stands at 216 for Johnson, 215 for Jeffries, one for Emmer, one vote Donalds and one for Jordan. Johnson needs 218 votes. Bridget Bowman Two House Republicans who have not supported Johnson for speaker were also among the few GOP lawmakers who did not back Trump during the presidential primary. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the primary, while Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., endorsed former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, who also served as governor of Norman's home state. A third Johnson defector, Texas Rep. Keith Self, did back Trump in the presidential primary along with the majority of House Republicans. Scott Wong Rebecca Shabad Rep. Keith Self, R-Texas, voted for Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., for speaker. This is the third Johnson defection. Scott Wong Rebecca Shabad Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., voted for Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, for speaker on the first ballot, the second GOP defection after Massie. Alexandra Marquez As former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., voted for Jeffries, Democrats applauded. Kyle Stewart Alexandra Marquez Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., said she was voting for \"MAGA Mike Johnson\" during her turn in the roll-call vote. Rebecca Shabad House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., and House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., are furiously taking notes during the speaker vote on the first ballot that's still ongoing. Kyle Stewart Rep. Tom Massie votes for Majority Whip Tom Emmer to be speaker. Massie had said before the vote he was a \"no\" on Johnson. Alexandra Marquez Kyle Stewart Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, was heckled on the House floor by Republicans shouting \"order!\" as he sought to say a few words about Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., while he voted for him as speaker. After Republicans' outcry, the clerk reminded Green that he only needed to say someone's surname to vote for them. Rebecca Shabad Former House Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., didn't cast a vote for speaker. Neither did current House Freedom Caucus Chair Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., and a few other Republicans. Annemarie Bonner Kyle Stewart Many Congress members brought their kids to the Capitol today, an opening day tradition to bring family members since members are expected to be sworn in later. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., has her son sitting on her lap in the chamber. Rep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Calif., said in a social media post that he brought his son with him. When his son was a baby, he famously brought him to the lengthy speaker vote that ended with Kevin McCarthy elected after 15 rounds. He captioned the side-by-side comparison, \"How it started, how it's going.\" Kyle Stewart It's notable that Reps. Lauren Boebert and Tim Burchett voted for Johnson, both were considered possible nos. Members may change their vote up until the end, though. Kyle Stewart The speaker vote has begun. Only Johnson and Jeffries were nominated but members can vote for any person during the vote. Annemarie Bonner Sahil Kapur Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., nominated Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., to be speaker of the House. In his speech, he called Jeffries' leadership one of \"compromise, conviction, and compassion.\" He threw shade at Mike Johnson’s handling of the government funding package last month, saying Jeffries is the only candidate for speaker who knows how to cut a bipartisan deal and stick to it. Democrats applauded. \"There is only one leader who understands the needs of the working people and has lived the American dream himself and is committed to ensuring its promise for future generations,\" he added. Frank Thorp Vproducer and off-air reporter Senators were sworn in in groups of four, and Ohio Sen. and VP-elect JD Vance was standing behind Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, as he was being sworn in by VP Harris. Vance and Harris did not appear to shake hands or interact. The full number of the Senate is now 99 senators: 52 Republicans and 47 Democrats. Alexandra Marquez Rep. Lisa McClain, R-Mich., the chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, officially nominated Johnson to another term as speaker. In a speech on the House floor, she called Johnson the same, \"kind and caring person as he was before he assumed this role.\" \"I know Mike will be an integral part of this country’s comeback,\" McClain added. \"He will lead us through another successful Republican majority, as chairwoman of the unified House Republican Conference, I can say proudly that we are ready to govern.\" Kyle Stewart Scott Wong Reporting from The House The House has finished its quorum call, taking the roll to see how many members are here today to vote. One Republican is missing — that's the empty seat just vacated by former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla. Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., was initially absent but has since arrived, meaning all members (434) are now here. That's 219 Republicans and 215 Democrats. Johnson will need to win a majority — 218 votes — to be re-elected as speaker. He can lose one Republican and still win the gavel. Sahil Kapur Rebecca Shabad Lawmakers in the chamber applauded as the House clerk announced that former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., won't take his seat in the new Congress. While Gaetz was re-elected to Congress in November, he resigned from the House late last year after Trump had selected him as his attorney general nominee. Gaetz withdrew from the process as he was marred by allegations of sexual assault, among other things. He has denied any wrongdoing but said he would not return to the House in the new Congress. Frank Thorp Vproducer and off-air reporter Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, is sworn in as president pro tempore. Annemarie Bonner Julie Tsirkin In response to a lengthy post from Johnson, Rep. Victoria Spartz offered praise for Mike Johnson after he posted a list of his commitments to the House, some of which are in response to Spartz's concerns. She told NBC News that she would vote yes on Johnson for speaker. \"I appreciate @SpeakerJohnson’s public commitment to the American people to deliver on President Trump’s agenda and drain the swamp,\" she wrote. She had been considered to be a possible no for Johnson. Rebecca Shabad Garrett Haake Before the vote for speaker, Mike Johnson posted a list on X of things that he has committed to do in the new Congress if re-elected as speaker. One of those things includes creating \"a working group comprised of independent experts — not corrupted by lobbyists and special interests — to work with DOGE and our committees on implementing recommended government and spending reforms to protect the American taxpayer.\" Trump’s “Department of Government Efficiency,” or DOGE, is not an official federal government agency but more of an independent commission, led by top Trump allies Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. This appears to be different from a subcommittee that Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., has already been tasked with leading to coordinate with DOGE. Nnamdi Egwuonwu Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., is set to become the longest-serving Black senator in U.S. history today. Scott, who has served since 2013 and is the lone Black GOP senator in the chamber, will surpass former Sen. Edward Brooke, R-Mass., when he's sworn in to his third term. (Brooke, who died in 2015, served two terms in the Senate, from 1967 to 1979.) Scott will be one of five Black senators in the 119th Congress, a record high. The South Carolina Republican will also make history as the first Black chairman of a Senate standing committee, leading the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs committee. He served as the panel's ranking member the past two years and first joined the committee in 2015. Another first is on tap as well. Scott will be the first Black elected official to lead the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the campaign arm of Senate Republicans, since its founding in 1916. “This Congress, I am thrilled to serve as the Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee,” Scott said in a statement. “My goal is simple: make America work for Americans.” Ali Vitali Brennan Leach Syedah Asghar Johnson said he hopes to win this speaker race on the first ballot and believes he has the votes to do so. \"I have made no deals with anyone, and I’m very proud to say that,\" he added. Johnson told reporters he was willing to go through as many ballots as former Speaker Kevin McCarthy did (15). “We have to get this job done and unify the conference, and I’m here for the long run,” said Johnson. Kyle Stewart The House is starting its quorum call now. This is a 15-minute vote by electronic device but in past years has taken 20-40 minutes. This will let us know how many members are present (which should be 434). The Honorable Kevin F. McCumber, acting House clerk, is in the chair with the gavel. This is his first time presiding over the opening of the Congress. After this, there will be nominations for speaker and then the speaker vote, which is done by voice. Kyle Stewart The mood in the chamber is positive. It is packed with families up in the galleries and several children of members are on the floor sitting in the seats. Johnson has been making the rounds in the chamber talking with members. Kyle Stewart Rebecca Shabad Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who holds the title of House speaker emerita, walked onto the House floor to applause from Democrats. Several members hugged and embraced her. This is her first time back at the Capitol since she fell last month during a congressional delegation trip to Luxembourg, which led to her being flown to Germany to undergo hip replacement surgery. Two members of her detail were holding up her arms to support her as she walked to her seat. Frank Thorp Vproducer and off-air reporter Alexandra Bacallao And at 11:45:10, Senate President Pro Tempore Patty Murray, D-Wash., adjourned the Senate sine die, meaning the 118th Congress is over (at least on the Senate side of the building). When they convene at noon, the 119th will begin, and newly elected or re-elected senators who won their elections in November will be sworn-in. Vice President Kamala Harris will be in the Capitol to swear in the senators, first on the Senate floor in alphabetical order in groups of four, and then again just for the cameras in the Old Senate Chamber one by one for photo op re-enactments. At the end of the day, Republicans will have the majority, but there will only be 99 senators. That’s because Sen-elect Jim Justice, currently the governor of West Virginia, won’t be sworn in right away, thanks to complications that would unfold if he were to leave his term before it ends Jan. 13. Kyle Stewart The 118th Congress is preparing to adjourn one final time ahead of the 119th Congress beginning at noon. Members have started coming into the chamber to stake out their seats. Families of members will be in the galleries up above to watch the proceedings. Roberto G. Gonzales Rebecca Shabad House Democratic Whip Katherine Clark, D-Mass., said in an interview on MSNBC that Democrats plan to vote for Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., for speaker. The speaker doesn't necessarily have to be from the party that holds the majority. \"We stand ready to vote for Hakeem Jeffries,\" she said about the Democratic leader. Annemarie Bonner The final session of the 118th House has started with Rep. Steve Womack, R-Ark., presiding. They will adjourn and the new House will start at noon. Adam Edelman Megan Lebowitz President-elect Donald Trump tapped multiple members of Congress for posts in his new administration, prompting the need for several special elections. Reps. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., and Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., were selected as Trump's picks to be national security adviser and the ambassador to the United Nations, respectively. Stefanik needs to be confirmed by the Senate. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul is required to schedule the date for a special election within 90 days of Stefanik's departure from Congress. The Florida secretary of state set the special general elections for Waltz seats for April 1, with the primaries taking place in late January. Special elections on the state level are also on the books just days into the new year. On Jan. 7, Virginians in Loudoun County will head to the polls for special state House and Senate elections. The outcomes of the state races will determine the control of the state legislature. Syedah Asghar Rebecca Shabad House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., told reporters this morning that he's not aware of any other people who plan to vote against Johnson for speaker today. Asked if he thinks there are any other \"no\" votes on Johnson for speaker, Scalise said, \"I haven’t seen any directly. So you know, Mike’s been talking to everybody.\" Johnson continues to fight to keep his position as House speaker as the newly elected 119th Congress will be sworn in and is set to vote on who will fill the spot. At least one Republican has stated he will not be voting for Johnson’s re-election. NBC’s Garrett Haake reports for \"TODAY.\" Brennan Leach Syedah Asghar Rebecca Shabad Johnson said this morning that he's not going to make a deal with his rank-and-file members in order to secure their support for his election as speaker in the new Congress. “I don’t make deals with anyone,\" Johnson told reporters on Capitol Hill. \"There’s no quid pro quo here. I don’t do anything in exchange for a vote other than commit to make this institution work as effectively and efficiently as possible.” Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., had suggested on former Rep. Matt Gaetz's show on America One News Network last night that Johnson should name conservative firebrand Chip Roy, R-Texas, as chairman of the House Rules Committee. Rebecca Shabad Trump just wished Johnson luck in the speaker vote today. The president-elect had publicly endorsed Johnson to continue serving in the leadership role. “Good luck today for Speaker Mike Johnson, a fine man of great ability, who is very close to having 100% support,\" Trump wrote. Trump said, \"A win for Mike today will be a big win for the Republican Party, and yet another acknowledgment of our 129 year most consequential Presidential Election!! — A BIG AFFIRMATION, INDEED. MAGA!” Alex Tabet Sen.-elect Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., said President-elect Donald Trump's national security Cabinet picks might require more scrutiny following the terrorist attack in New Orleans. Talking to reporters yesterday, Gallego was asked if Trump's picks should be fast-tracked in the wake of the New Year's Day terror attack. \"I think in light of what you saw yesterday, we want to make sure that you have the right national security nominees,\" he said. \"Just putting someone in place doesn't necessarily mean that you're actually going to have the type of collaboration [and] intelligence sharing that you need.\" Gallego did not indicate how he plans to vote on Trump's national security picks: Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence, Kash Patel for FBI director and Pete Hegseth for defense secretary. Asked about Trump's mass deportation plan, Gallego noted the specifics have yet to be unveiled, while adding that voters he spoke with on the campaign trail wanted guardrails on expelling migrants. \"They want a certain type of illegal immigrants deported,\" he said. \"What I didn't hear is, for family separations, and I didn't hear about jailing kids or anything of that nature.\" Gallego, who is set to become Arizona's first Latino senator, also reacted to Trump saying he would nominate Kari Lake to lead Voice Of America. \"She's got great experience in the media, I wish her well,\" Gallego said of his Republican opponent in last year's Senate race. \"I hope she has learned that misinformation is not appreciated by Americans,\" he added in a jab against Lake, who for years denied that she lost her 2022 bid to become Arizona's governor. Frank Thorp Vproducer and off-air reporter Reporting from Washington While the House is expected to swear in all 434 of its members today, only the class of 32 newly elected or re-elected senators who won their elections in November will be sworn. Vice President Kamala Harris will be in the Capitol to swear in the senators, first on the Senate floor in alphabetical order in groups of four, and then again just for the cameras in the Old Senate Chamber one-by-one for photo-ops. At the end of the day, Republicans will have the majority, but there will only be 99 senators instead of 100. That’s because Sen.-elect Jim Justice, R-W.Va., won’t be sworn in today thanks to a quirk in how the governorship in West Virginia would be subject to a weird game of musical chairs if he were to leave his term before it ends Jan. 13. Megan Lebowitz Republicans enter the 119th Congress with little room for error in each chamber. The 2024 election put Republicans on track to start the new Congress with a 53-47 majority in the Senate and a 220-215 advantage in the House. However, Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., has since resigned from the House, and Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., was selected as national security adviser. If Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., is confirmed as ambassador to the United Nations, Republicans' House majority could temporarily narrow even further, though special elections would be on the horizon for vacated seats. Senate Republicans will need the support of Democrats to overcome the 60 votes needed to break the filibuster for most legislation. Only a simple majority is needed for administration posts. Alec Hernández Megan Lebowitz Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., reiterated his staunch opposition to voting for Johnson during an appearance on former Rep. Matt Gaetz's new show on the right-wing One America News Network. \"You can pull all my fingernails off, you can shove bamboo up them, you can start cutting off my fingers, I am not voting for Mike Johnson tomorrow,\" Massie told Gaetz in an interview that aired last night. \"And you can take that to the bank.\" Gaetz also spoke during last night's broadcast with Reps. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., and Victoria Spartz, R-Ind., whose votes Johnson likely needs to retain his speakership. Spartz said that while she remains open minded, she will not vote for Johnson unless she sees \"concrete\" changes from the speaker. \"As of right now, if we don’t have concrete commitment from Speaker Johnson, I’m not going to be supporting him tomorrow, but I’m open minded,\" she said. \"I’m going to talk to some other members, and hopefully we’ll connect with him later tonight or tomorrow morning and figure out if we can actually make real changes in this institution.\" Boebert said that she believes Johnson can retain his post if he commits to naming Chip Roy, R-Texas, as the chairman of the Rules Committee. Zoë Richards Syedah Asghar Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., faces what could be an uphill battle to maintain the speaker's gavel, as some Republican members threaten his bid. It would just take two Republican opponents in the new 119th Congress' razor-thin majority to derail Johnson's effort to retain speakership for two more years. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., began urging colleagues to reject Johnson's bid ahead of the vote, which is scheduled for later today. Johnson appeared to brush away concerns that his speakership was in jeopardy, telling NBC News yesterday that he expected to win on the first ballot. \"I hope so. That’s the plan,\" Johnson said when asked about the upcoming vote. Johnson has also said he met with Trump on New Year’s Day at the president-elect's Florida club. Trump publicly boosted Johnson's bid on his social media platform on Monday, saying Johnson had his “Complete & Total Endorsement” and that by keeping the speaker's gavel, Johnson would help the Republican-controlled Congress implement his 2025 agenda. Kyle Stewart Reporting from Washington When the 119th Congress convenes today, the first agenda item for the House will be electing the speaker. For the past century, this was usually a straightforward process, with the majority party electing their speaker nominee on the first ballot. That changed two years ago when it took 15 ballots for now-former Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., to secure the gavel. While Mike Johnson, R-La., is in the chair now, his term as speaker expires when the current Congress adjourns this morning. Each new Congress is a fresh start and the speaker has to be elected again. To become speaker, a candidate needs the votes of a majority of members present, which will be 218 if all 434 members show up and vote. The 20th Amendment mandates that Congress meets at noon on the third day of January. The House will not proceed to any other business, including swearing in lawmakers, until the speaker is chosen. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC",

                "title": "Johnson elected US House speaker in close vote ",
                "content": "Republican Mike Johnson survived a razor-thin vote to remain House Speaker in a drama-filled, highly-anticipated vote that marked the start of complete Republican control in Washington. Johnson could only afford to lose two votes because of the tight margin of control Republicans have in Congress. While he came close to losing re-election, he survived the vote after some lobbying. President-elect Donald Trump previously endorsed Johnson for the role of House speaker, saying \"a win for Mike today will be a big win for the Republican Party\". The House Speaker is one of the most powerful posts in Washington, controlling the lower chamber of the US Congress, and second in line to the presidency after the vice president. Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, was backed by nearly all Republicans in his bid for re-election. But that success was not without some controversary. The vote for Speaker requires a candidate to receive the support of a majority of the House - 218 votes. But because of a razor-thin Republican majority in the House, Johnson could only stand to face opposition from two Republicans. Johnson already faced one hard \"no\" from Congressman Thomas Massie of Kentucky. \"You can pull all my fingernails out. You can shove bamboo up in them. You can start cutting off my fingers. I am not voting for Mike Johnson,\" Massie said Thursday in a television interview. Several other Republicans had put themselves in the \"undecided\" column heading into the vote. During the initial votes, three of those undecided Republicans voted for other lawmakers over Johnson, preventing him from reaching the 218 votes he needed. Three lawmakers - Massie, South Carolina Congressman Ralph Norman and Texas Congressman Keith Self - named other options to serve as the next speaker. That led Johnson to flee the House floor and lobby members to back him. Some 45 minutes later, he returned to the House chamber. Both Norman and Self changed their votes to back Johnson. The gavel struck and Johnson won re-election. Norman told reporters after the election that he changed his vote after speaking with Johnson in a room outside the House chamber. He said Johnson told him there would be more conservatives at the table during negotiations, fewer deals made between congressional and committee leadership without outside input from other lawmakers and enough time to read bill text before votes are scheduled. \"When we left that small room, he convinced me and Keith (Self),\" Norman said. \"He (Johnson) said I will do that, just give me the chance. He knew and I knew if it went to the second ballot it was going to get tougher and tougher.\" Another player got involved throughout the tense speaker election - President-elect Donald Trump. Norman spoke with Trump twice during the speaker vote. The first time was when fellow Republican Nancy Mace of South Carolina handed him her phone to speak with the president-elect. The second was while meeting with Johnson, Self and several others. \"(Trump) is as enthusiastic,\" Norman said of the call with the presidnet-elect. \"He said, 'Norman, we have the most opportunity we've ever had - the House, Senate, a trifecta, you don't get that opportunity.' I said, 'Mr. President I agree with you, I'm just hoping Mike has got the oomph to pull this off.\" Norman said the president-elect also said Johnson is the only one who has the likeability to win the speaker election. Self told reporters after the vote that he spoke with Trump before and after the speaker election. He said he changed his mind when Johnson pledged there would be more members, including from the far-right House Freedom Caucus, at the negotiating table. \"We shored up the reconciliation team because we know that this will be a heavy lift to get the Trump agenda across the line in the reconciliation line,\" he said. Friday marked the first day of the 119th Congress. Republicans have unified control of Washington, with majorities in both the House and Senate and with Trump returning to the White House later in January. During his acceptance speech, Johnson said that this Congress would champion the idea of America first - a slogan promoted by Trump. After Trump's re-election, he said Americans are demanding their interests are put first again. \"And we will,\" Johnson said. Voting in a new speaker is the first requirement of the new session of Congress, and without that leader in place, the chamber cannot move on to any other function. This has led to chaos in the past - including when former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy had to go through 15 rounds of voting before he was confirmed to the leadership post. Minutes before the vote on Friday, Johnson posted on X several of his plans, if elected. He promised to create a \"working group comprised of independent experts\" to work with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) that Trump named Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Republican Vivek Ramaswamy to lead. That working group, he said, would review existing audits of federal agencies and entities created by Congress and issue a report. \"If we want to restore fiscal responsibility, we must start by being transparent about the dollars that are spent, address the issues we find, and then hold those accountable who have misspent funds,\" Johnson wrote. Biden decided to scrap the deal despite concerns that it could damage Washington's relations with Tokyo. The US president-elect dismisses the case as \"nothing but a rigged charade\". An American college football player, a young aspiring nurse and a mother of a four-year-old are among the victims. The family of London man Edward Pettifer mourn a \"wonderful son, brother, grandson, nephew and friend\". Friday's vote underscores the challenges for Trump in keeping House Republicans united to legislate his agenda. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

                "title": "Real Madrid CF - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (Spanish pronunciation: [reˈal maˈðɾið ˈkluβ ðe ˈfuðβol] ⓘ), commonly referred to as Real Madrid, is a Spanish professional football club based in Madrid. The club competes in La Liga, the top tier of Spanish football. Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since its inception. The honorific title real is Spanish for \"royal\" and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 alongside with the crown in the club crest. Real Madrid have played their home matches in the 85,000-capacity Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting clubs, Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout its history. The official Madrid anthem is the \"Hala Madrid y nada más\", written by RedOne and Manuel Jabois.[8] The club is one of the most widely supported in the world and is the most followed football club on social media according to the CIES Football Observatory as of 2023.[9][10] It was estimated to be worth $6.6 billion in 2024, making it the world's most valuable football club.[11] In 2024, Real Madrid become the first football club to make €1 billion ($1.08bn) in revenue according to the club's announcement.[12] Real Madrid are one of the most successful clubs in the sport. In domestic football, the club has won 71 trophies; a record 36 La Liga titles, 20 Copa del Rey, 13 Supercopa de España, a Copa Eva Duarte and a Copa de la Liga.[13] In International football, Real Madrid have won a record 35 trophies: a record 15 European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, a record six UEFA Super Cups, two UEFA Cups, a joint record two Latin Cups, a record one Iberoamerican Cup, and a record nine FIFA Club World championships.[note 1] Madrid was ranked first in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 2000, 2002, 2014, 2017.[17] In UEFA, Madrid ranks first in the all-time club ranking.[18][19] Being one of the three founding members of La Liga that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929 (along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona), Real Madrid has many long-standing rivalries, most notably El Clásico with Barcelona and El Derbi Madrileño with Atlético Madrid. The club established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s and 60s, winning five consecutive and six overall European Cups and reaching a further two finals. This success was replicated on the domestic front, with Madrid winning 12 league titles in 16 years. This team, which included Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás, Paco Gento and Raymond Kopa is considered, by some in the sport, to be the greatest of all time.[20][21] Real Madrid is known for its Galácticos policy, which involves signing the world's best players, such as Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane and David Beckham to create a superstar team.[22] The term 'Galácticos policy' generally refers to the two eras of Florentino Pérez's presidency of the club (2000–2006 and 2009–2018); however, players brought in just before his tenure are sometimes considered to be part of the Galácticos legacy. A notable example is Steve McManaman, who like many other players also succeeded under the policy.[23] On 26 June 2009, Madrid signed Cristiano Ronaldo for a record-breaking £80 million (€94 million);[24] he became both the club's and history's all-time top goalscorer.[25][26][27][28] Madrid have recently relaxed the Galácticos policy, instead focusing on signing young talents such as Vinícius Júnior, Rodrygo, Jude Bellingham[29] and Kylian Mbappé.[30][31] Real Madrid is recognised as the greatest football club of the 20th century by FIFA and as the best European club during the same timeframe by the IFFHS,[32] while also receiving the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit in 2004.[33] Real Madrid has the highest participations in the European Cup/Champions League (55),[18] a tournament in which they hold the overall record for the most wins, most draws and most goals scored.[34] Real Madrid is the only club to have won three consecutive titles (three-peat) in the European Cup/Champions League twice, first in 1955–56, 1956–57, and 1957–58, and second in 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18 and was the first and the only club to win La Decima (in 2013-14).[35] In June 2024, they won a record-extending 15th Champions League title (the sixth in eleven seasons), recognised as such by Guinness World Records.[36] Real Madrid is the first club across all of Europe's top-five leagues to win 100 trophies in all competitions.[37] As of July 2024,[update] Real Madrid are ranked 2nd in the UEFA club rankings and first in last 10 years (2013–2023) overall.[38][39] Real Madrid's origins go back to when football was introduced to Madrid by the academics and students of the Institución Libre de Enseñanza, which included several Cambridge and Oxford University graduates.[40] They founded (Sociedad) Sky Football in 1897, commonly known as La Sociedad (The Society) as it was the only one based in Madrid, playing on Sunday mornings at Moncloa. In 1900, conflict between members caused some of them to leave and create a new club, Nueva Sociedad de Football (New Society of Football), to distinguish themselves from Sky Football. Among the dissenters were Julián Palacios, recognized as the first Real Madrid president, Juan Padrós and Carlos Padrós, the latter two being brothers and future presidents of Real Madrid. In 1901, this new club was renamed as Madrid Football Club. Later, following a restructuring in 1902, Sky was renamed as \"New Foot-Ball Club\".[41][42][43] On 6 March 1902, after a new Board presided by Juan Padrós had been elected, Madrid Football Club was officially founded.[7] The Padrós brothers summoned other football enthusiasts to a meeting in the back room of Al Capricho, the family business. They viewed football as a mass sport that should be accessible to representatives of all social classes, and thought the new club should embody that idea. The brothers proposed the name, Madrid Football Club, which was unanimously accepted. The membership fee was also set, two pesetas a month, and the color of the shirt was chosen to be white in honour of a famous English team Corinthian, which Juan Padrós had met on one of his trips.[44][45] Three years after its founding, in 1905, Madrid FC won its first title after defeating Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Cup final. The club became one of the founding sides of the Royal Spanish Football Federation on 4 January 1909, when club president Adolfo Meléndez signed the foundation agreement of the Spanish FA. After moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912.[46] In 1920, the club's name was changed to Real Madrid after King Alfonso XIII granted the title of Real (Royal) to the club.[47] In 1929, the first Spanish football league was founded. Real Madrid led the first league season until the last match, a loss to Athletic Bilbao, meant they finished runners-up to Barcelona.[48] Real Madrid won its first league title in the 1931–32 season and retained it the following year.[49] On 14 April 1931, the arrival of the Second Spanish Republic caused the club to lose the title Real and the royal crown on its emblem, going back to being named Madrid Football Club until the end of the Spanish Civil War. Football continued during the Second World War, and on 13 June 1943, Madrid beat Barcelona 11–1 in the second leg of the Copa del Generalísimo semi-finals, the Spanish Cup having been renamed in honour of General Franco.[note 2][50] The first leg, played at the Les Corts in Catalonia, had ended with Barcelona winning 3–0. Madrid complained about all the three goals that referee Fombona Fernández had allowed for Barcelona,[51] with the home supporters also whistling Madrid throughout, whom they accused of employing roughhouse tactics, and Fombona for allowing them to. The newspaper Ya reported the whistling as a \"clear intention to attack the representatives of Spain.\"[52] Barcelona fans were banned from traveling to Madrid. The day of the second leg, the Barcelona team were insulted and stones were thrown at their bus as soon as they left their hotel. Barcelona's striker Mariano Gonzalvo said of the incident, \"Five minutes before the game had started, our penalty area was already full of coins.\" Barcelona goalkeeper Luis Miró rarely approached his line—when he did, he was armed with stones. As Francisco Calvet told the story, \"They were shouting: Reds! Separatists!... a bottle just missed Sospedra that would have killed him if it had hit him. It was all set up.\"[53] Real Madrid went 2–0 up within half an hour. The third goal brought with it a sending off for Barcelona's Benito García after he made what Calvet claimed was a \"completely normal tackle\". Madrid's José Llopis Corona recalled: \"At which point, they got a bit demoralized,\" while Ángel Mur countered, \"at which point, we thought: 'go on then, score as many as you want'.\"[54] Madrid made it 8–0 by half-time; two goals were also ruled out for offside, and proceeded to score a further three goals in the second half, to which Barcelona replied with a late consolation goal.[55] According to football writer Sid Lowe, \"There have been relatively few mentions of the game [since] and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid. Indeed, the 11–1 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelona's history. This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims.\"[51] Fernando Argila, Barcelona's reserve goalkeeper from the 1943 match, said: \"There was no rivalry. Not, at least, until that game.\"[56] Santiago Bernabéu became president of Real Madrid in 1943.[57] Under his presidency, the club was rebuilt after the Civil War, and he oversaw the construction of the club's current stadium, Estadio Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (now known as the Santiago Bernabéu), and its training facilities Ciudad Deportiva. Additionally, during the 1950s former Real Madrid Amateurs player Miguel Malbo founded Real Madrid's youth academy, or \"cantera,\" known today as La Fábrica. Beginning in 1953, he embarked upon a strategy of signing world-class players from abroad, the most prominent being Alfredo Di Stéfano.[58] In 1955, acting upon the idea proposed by Gabriel Hanot, a French sports journalist and editor of L'Équipe, Bernabéu, Ernest Bedrignan (deputy chairman of the Ligue de Football Professionnel)[59] and Gusztáv Sebes created the European Cup, a continental tournament for the league champions around Europe, which is today known as the UEFA Champions League.[60] It was under Bernabéu's guidance that Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football. The club won the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included the 7–3 Hampden Park final against Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960.[58] After these five consecutive successes, Real was permanently awarded the original cup and earned the right to wear the UEFA badge of honour.[61] Real Madrid's achievements in Europe were built upon its unprecedented domestic dominance, with the club winning twelve league titles out of sixteen possible from 1953–54 to 1968–69, including a five-in-a-row sequence in 1961–65, and finishing runners-up a further three times.[62] The club won the European Cup for a sixth time in 1966, defeating Partizan Belgrade 2–1 in the final with a team composed entirely of same nationality players, a first in the competition.[63] This team became known as the Yé-yé. The name \"Yé-yé\" came from the \"Yeah, yeah, yeah\" chorus in The Beatles' song \"She Loves You\" after four members of the team posed for Marca and impersonated the Beatles.[64] The Yé-yé generation was also European Cup runners-up in 1962[65] and 1964.[63] In the 1970s, Real Madrid won six league championships and three Spanish Cups.[66] The club competed in its first European Cup Winners' Cup in 1970–71 and progressed all the way to the final, where it lost to English side Chelsea 2–1 in a replay.[67] On 2 July 1978, club president Santiago Bernabéu died while the World Cup was being played in Argentina. FIFA decreed three days of mourning to honour him during the tournament.[68] The following year, the club organized the first edition of the Trofeo Santiago Bernabéu in memory of its former president. Bernabéu had been Real Madrid's president for almost 35 years, during which his club won one Intercontinental Cup, six European Cups, 16 league titles, six Spanish Cups, two Latin Cups and one Copa Eva Duarte.[69] In the early 1980s, Real Madrid had lost its grasp on the La Liga title, until a new cohort of home-grown stars brought domestic success back to the club.[70][71] Spanish sports journalist Julio César Iglesias gave to this generation the name La Quinta del Buitre (\"Vulture's Cohort\"), which was derived from the nickname given to one of its members, Emilio Butragueño. The other four members were Manolo Sanchís, Martín Vázquez, Míchel and Miguel Pardeza. All five footballers were graduates of Real Madrid's youth academy.[70][71] With La Quinta del Buitre (reduced to four members when Pardeza left for Zaragoza in 1986) and notable players like goalkeeper Francisco Buyo, right-back Miguel Porlán Chendo and Mexican striker Hugo Sánchez, Real Madrid had one of the best teams in Spain and Europe during the second half of the 1980s, winning two UEFA Cups, five Spanish championships in a row, one Spanish Cup, and three Spanish Super Cups.[70][71] In the early 1990s, La Quinta del Buitre split up after Martín Vázquez, Emilio Butragueño and Míchel left the club. In 1996, President Lorenzo Sanz appointed Fabio Capello as coach.[72] Although his tenure lasted only one season, Real Madrid were proclaimed league champions, and players like Predrag Mijatović, Davor Šuker, Clarence Seedorf, Roberto Carlos and keeper Bodo Illgner, arrived at the club to strengthen a squad that already boasted the likes of Raúl, Fernando Hierro and Fernando Redondo. As a result, Real Madrid (with the addition of Fernando Morientes in 1997) finally ended its 32-year wait for its seventh European Cup: in 1998, under manager Jupp Heynckes, they defeated Juventus 1–0 in the final with a goal from Mijatović.[73] In November 1999, Vicente del Bosque took over as coach. For the last season of the century, 1999–2000, the squad was still led by the older veterans such as Fernando Hierro, Fernando Redondo, Roberto Carlos and Raúl. Real added the budding young talents of Guti and Iker Casillas, supported by the arrival of Steve McManaman and Nicolas Anelka from the English Premier League, alongside local talents Míchel Salgado and Iván Helguera. In Del Bosque's first season in charge, Real won the Champions League for the eighth time, following a 3–0 victory over Valencia in the final, with goals from Morientes, McManaman and Raúl.[74] This victory marked the beginning of a successful period in Real Madrid's history.[75] In July 2000, Florentino Pérez was elected club president.[76] He vowed in his campaign to erase the club's €270 million debt and modernize the club's facilities. However, the primary electoral promise that propelled Pérez to victory was the signing of Luís Figo from arch-rivals Barcelona.[77] The following year, the club had its training ground rezoned and used the money to begin assembling the Galácticos team by signing a global star every summer, which included Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Luís Figo, David Beckham and Fabio Cannavaro.[78] It is debatable whether the gamble paid off, as despite winning the UEFA Champions League and an Intercontinental Cup in 2002, followed by La Liga in 2003, the club failed to win a major trophy for the next three seasons. Off the pitch, the Zidanes y Pavones policy resulted in increased financial success based on the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, particularly in Asia.[79] The few days after the capturing of the 2003 La Liga title were surrounded with controversy. The first controversial decision came when Pérez sacked winning coach Vicente del Bosque.[80] Over a dozen players left the club, including Madrid captain Fernando Hierro, while defensive midfielder Claude Makélélé refused to take part in training in protest at being one of the lowest-paid players at the club and subsequently moved to Chelsea.[81] \"That's a lot [of players leaving] when the normal rule is: never change a winning team,\" stated Zidane.[82] Real Madrid, with newly appointed coach Carlos Queiroz, started their domestic league slowly after a hard win over Real Betis.[82] The 2005–06 season began with the promise of several new signings: Júlio Baptista (€24 million), Robinho (€30 million), and Sergio Ramos (€27 million).[83] However, Real Madrid suffered from some poor results, including a 0–3 loss at the hands of Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu in November 2005.[84] Madrid's coach Wanderley Luxemburgo was sacked the following month and his replacement was Juan Ramón López Caro.[85] A brief return to form came to an abrupt halt after Madrid lost the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-finals 6–1 to Real Zaragoza,[86] a defeat that was nearly reversed with a 4–0 home victory. Shortly after, Real Madrid were eliminated from the Champions League for a fourth successive year, this time at the hands of Arsenal. On 27 February 2006, Florentino Pérez resigned.[87] Ramón Calderón was elected as club president on 2 July 2006 and subsequently appointed Fabio Capello as the new coach and Predrag Mijatović as the new sporting director. Real Madrid won the Liga title in 2007 for the first time in four years, but Capello was nonetheless sacked at the end of the campaign.[88] The title was won on 17 June, where Real faced Mallorca at the Bernabéu while Barcelona and Sevilla, the other title challengers, faced Gimnàstic de Tarragona and Villarreal, respectively. At half-time, Real were 0–1 down, while Barcelona had surged ahead into a 0–3 lead in Tarragona. However, three goals in the last half-hour secured Madrid a 3–1 win and their first league title since 2003.[89] Real Madrid repeated as league winners in 2007–08, but the following season ended up being one of the most disastrous in the club's history: Real was knocked out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage for the fifth time in a row, losing to Liverpool 0–5 on aggregate, and was embarrassed by Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu with a humiliating 2–6 loss, which all but confirmed the league title for Barça that went on to win the treble.[90] On 1 June 2009, Florentino Pérez regained Real Madrid's presidency amid the outrage over the club's decline.[91][92] Pérez continued with the Galácticos policy pursued in his first term, buying Kaká from Milan for a record-breaking (in pounds sterling) sum of £56 million,[93] and then breaking the record again by purchasing Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United for £80 million.[94] Real Madrid spent in excess of €261 million in the summer of 2009, and the assembled team was soon dubbed the Second Galácticos.[95] The 2009–10 season, however, was a transitional one as Madrid again finished second in the league, although this time amassing 96 points, the club's record at the time, and went out of the Champions League at the hands of Lyon. The season was marred by Cristiano Ronaldo's injury, that sidelined him for seven weeks,[96] although he still topped the goalscoring charts with 33 goals, and Madrid became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals. Real Madrid also had the misfortune to become the runners-up with the highest points total in the history of Europe's top five leagues, until surpassed by Liverpool's 97 points in 2018–19.[97][98] José Mourinho took over as manager in May 2010.[99][100] In the 2010–11 season, the rebuilt Madrid successfully fought on all fronts, going toe to toe with a brilliant Barcelona side which some regard as the greatest team in football history. Ultimately, Madrid finished second in the league, with 92 points and four behind their perennial rivals, defeated them in the Copa del Rey final, and lost to Barça in the Champions League semi-finals, where Real progressed to for the first time since 2002–03. Moreover, from 16 April through 3 May, a rare occurrence happened when, for the first time ever, four Clásicos were to be played in a span of just 18 days. The first fixture was in the league campaign on 16 April (which ended 1–1 with penalty goals for both sides), the second one was in the Copa del Rey final (which was won by Madrid 1–0 a.e.t., bringing them their first trophy in the second Galáctico era) on 20 April and the third and fourth ones in the controversial[101][102] two-legged Champions League semi-finals on 27 April and 3 May (Barcelona won on aggregate with a 2–0 away victory and a 1–1 home draw).[103] Madrid again became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals, repeating its output from the previous season, with Ronaldo scoring 40 and winning the European Golden Shoe. In the 2011–12 season, Real Madrid won La Liga for a record 32nd time in its history, also finishing the season with numerous league records set, including 100 points amassed in a single season, a total of 121 goals scored, a goal difference of +89, 16 away games won, and 32 wins overall.[104] They also competed in the UEFA Champions League for the 15th successive season,[105] losing in the semi-finals to Bayern Munich in a penalty shoot-out after a 3–3 aggregate tie. Madrid entered the Copa del Rey as the defending champions, but lost 3–4 on aggregate in the quarter-finals to Barcelona. In the same season, Cristiano Ronaldo became the fastest player to reach 100 goals scored in Spanish league history. In reaching 101 goals in 92 games, Ronaldo surpassed Real Madrid legend Ferenc Puskás, who scored 100 goals in 105 matches. Ronaldo set a new club mark for individual goals scored in one year (60) and became the first player ever to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single season.[106][107] Real Madrid started the 2012–13 season by winning the Supercopa de España, defeating Barcelona on away goals. However, the super cup turned out to be their only trophy of the season, despite being close to win them all. Real finished runners-up to Barça in La Liga, accumulating 85 points, and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League for the third year in a row, where they were eliminated by Borussia Dortmund 3–4 on aggregate. Madrid also entered the Copa del Rey in the round of 32, going on a memorable run to the final, which saw them defeat Barcelona in the semi-finals before losing to Atlético Madrid 1–2 a.e.t. Real Madrid faced the Blaugrana six times throughout the season, coming away with three wins, two draws, and one loss. A major transfer of the season was the signing of Luka Modrić from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in the region of £33 million.[108] After a loss to Atlético in the Copa del Rey final, Pérez announced the departure of José Mourinho at the end of the season by \"mutual agreement\".[109] On 25 June 2013, Carlo Ancelotti succeeded Mourinho to become the manager of Real Madrid on a three-year deal, with Zinedine Zidane named as one of his assistants.[110] On 1 September 2013, the long-awaited transfer of Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur was announced. The transfer of the Welshman was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer price approximated at €100 million.[111] In Ancelotti's first season at the club, Real Madrid fought on all three fronts for the continental treble. Despite leading in the league campaign on multiple occasions, Madrid ultimately finished in third place (level on points with Barcelona and three behind cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid), collecting 87 points in total and scoring a record 104 goals.[112] By that time, Los Blancos had already secured the Copa del Rey – against rivals Barcelona – in April, with Bale scoring the winner.[113] The major breakthrough came in the UEFA Champions League, where Real returned to the final after twelve years, having beaten defending champions Bayern Munich 5–0 on aggregate in the semi-finals.[114] In the final, they defeated then-recently-league winners Atlético Madrid 4–1 a.e.t. to clinch their tenth European Cup (first since 2002) and become the first team to win ten European Cups/Champions League titles, an achievement known as \"La Décima\" (Spanish: \"The Tenth,\" [la ˈðeθima]).[115] Real's attacking trio of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, dubbed the BBC, finished the season with 97 goals.[116] After winning the 2014 Champions League, Real Madrid signed goalkeeper Keylor Navas, midfielder Toni Kroos and attacking midfielder James Rodríguez.[117] In August, Madrid won the 2014 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, the club's 79th official trophy.[118] During the last week of the 2014 summer transfer window, Real Madrid sold two players key to the previous season's successes: Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich and Ángel Di María to Manchester United. This decision by the club was surrounded by controversy, with Cristiano Ronaldo stating, \"If I was in charge, maybe I would have done things differently,\" while Carlo Ancelotti admitted, \"We must start again from zero.\"[119] After a slow start to the 2014–15 season, Real Madrid went on a record-breaking 22-match winning streak, which included wins against Barcelona and Liverpool, surpassing the previous Spanish record of 18 successive wins set by Frank Rijkaard's Barça in the 2005–06 season.[120] In late December, Real Madrid won their first Club World Cup, defeating San Lorenzo 2–0 in the final.[121] The winning streak came to an end in their opening match of 2015 with a loss to Valencia, leaving the club two short of equalling the world record of 24 consecutive wins.[122] Madrid was in contention for both the La Liga title and the UEFA Champions League until the end but ultimately came up short, finishing with 92 points in the league, two behind treble-winning Barcelona and losing to Juventus 2–3 on aggregate in the Champions League semi-finals.[123] Ronaldo finished the season scoring 48 league goals, winning his fourth European Golden Shoe, and 61 goals in all competitions, breaking his record from 2011 to 2012.[124] Overall, despite playing an attractive attacking football and being the highest scoring team in Europe with 118 league goals,[125] several narrow defeats meant that Real finished the season with two trophies out of six possible, which contributed to the dismissal of Carlo Ancelotti on 25 May 2015.[126][127] On 3 June 2015, Rafael Benítez was confirmed as the new Real Madrid manager for the 2015–16 season, signing a three-year contract.[128] Real Madrid remained unbeaten in the league until a 3–2 loss at Sevilla on the matchday 11. This was followed by a 0–4 home loss in the first Clásico of the season against Barcelona. Perhaps, his reign is best remembered by multiple lopsided wins achieved both in La Liga and the Champions League (6–0 vs Espanyol, 8–0 vs Malmö, 10–2 vs Rayo Vallecano and others). In the Copa del Rey round of 32, Real accidentally fielded an ineligible player in a 3–1 first leg win at Cádiz and was disqualified from the tournament two days later by the competition judge, despite protests from president Pérez.[129][130][131] In the meantime, Madrid comfortably topped their UCL group with 16 points and a +16 goal difference. Benítez was relieved of his duties on 4 January 2016 following allegations of unpopularity with supporters, displeasure with players and a failure to produce good results against top teams.[132] Benítez's departure was announced along with the promotion of Zinedine Zidane to his first head coaching role.[133] Under Zidane, Madrid managed to turn the odds in its favour, ultimately winning the Champions League, something no one expected. The notable results include a 2–1 away victory over reigning treble winners Barcelona, who were on a record-breaking winning streak, a fantastic comeback against Wolfsburg in the Champions League quarter-finals (after losing the away game 0–2, Madrid erased the deficit and won 3–0 at home, courtesy of a Cristiano Ronaldo hat-trick), as well as a 12-game winning streak to conclude the league campaign, meaning Real finished second, with 90 points and just one point behind champions Barcelona, coming agonizingly close to clinching the title and overcoming a 12-point deficit in the process.[134] Finally, on 28 May, Real Madrid's eleventh Champions League title was won thanks to a 5–3 penalty shoot-out victory over rivals Atlético Madrid after a 1–1 draw in the final, with the achievement being termed \"La Undécima\".[135][136][127] Real Madrid began their 2016–17 campaign, which was to be Zidane's first full season in charge of the club, with a victory in the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla.[137] On 10 December 2016, Madrid played their 35th-straight match without a loss, which set a new club record.[138] On 18 December 2016, the club defeated Japanese outfit Kashima Antlers 4–2 in the final of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup.[139] With a 3–3 draw at Sevilla in the second leg of the Copa del Rey round of 16 on 12 January 2017, Madrid progressed to the quarter-finals with a 6–3 aggregate victory and extended its unbeaten run to 40 matches, breaking Barcelona's Spanish record of 39 matches unbeaten in all competitions from the previous season.[140] Their unbeaten streak ended after a 1–2 away loss against the same opposition in La Liga three days later.[141] The team then was knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Celta Vigo 3–4 on aggregate. These slips, however, did not affect the overall trajectory of the season. In May, Madrid won the league title for a record 33rd time, their first title in five years, accumulating 93 points in the process.[142] On 3 June 2017, the club's victory over Juventus in the Champions League final resulted in Real Madrid becoming the first team to successfully defend their title in the UEFA Champions League era, and the first to win consecutive titles in the competition since Milan in 1989 and 1990, when the tournament was known as the European Cup.[143][144] Real Madrid's title was its 12th, extending the record, and its third in four years. The achievement is also known as \"La Duodécima\".[145] The 2016–17 season was the greatest campaign in terms of trophies won (four out of possible five) in the history of Real Madrid, an achievement that would be later equalled in the 2017–18 season.[146] Real kicked off the 2017–18 campaign by winning its second consecutive and fourth overall UEFA Super Cup in a 2–1 victory against Manchester United.[147] Five days later, Real Madrid beat Barcelona at the Camp Nou 3–1 in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de España and then defeated Barça 2–0 in the return leg, ending their 24 consecutive match scoring record in El Clásico matches and winning the second trophy of the season.[148] On 16 December 2017, Real beat Brazilian club Grêmio 1–0 in the FIFA Club World Cup final and became the first team to retain the trophy.[149] In the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, Madrid once again progressed to the final where they defeated Liverpool 3–1 to become the first club to win three straight titles in the Champions League era, as well as the first team to win three consecutive titles in the European Cup/Champions League since Bayern Munich in 1976. The trophy also marked Madrid's fourth win in five years and their eighth consecutive semi-finals appearance. On 31 May, only five days after winning the final, Zidane announced his resignation as Real Madrid manager, citing the club's \"need for change\" as his rationale for departing.[150][151] Zidane's and Ronaldo's departures marked the end of the Second Galáctico Era that yielded four Champions League titles, two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey, two Supercopa de España, three UEFA Super Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cup titles. The team was instrumental in ending Barcelona's dominance, despite the Blaugrana boasting arguably the greatest collection of talent in history,[152] and overshadowed the Catalans on the European stage.[153] Real Madrid was also somewhat notoriously unlucky in its league campaigns throughout these nine years, finishing runners-up with 96, 92 (twice) and 90 points, as well as on 87 points in third place, just three off the league winners.[98] On 12 June 2018, Real Madrid named Julen Lopetegui, the head coach of the Spanish national team, as their new manager. It was announced that he would officially begin his managerial duties after the 2018 FIFA World Cup. However, the Spanish national team sacked Lopetegui a day prior to the tournament, stating that he had negotiated terms with the club without informing them.[154][155] The club then began re-shaping the squad in the summer of 2018, which included the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus for a reported €117 million.[156] Madrid began their 2018–19 campaign by losing to Atlético Madrid 2–4 a.e.t. in the 2018 UEFA Super Cup. After a 1–5 loss to Barcelona in El Clásico on 28 October which left Real Madrid in the ninth place with only 14 points after ten games, Lopetegui was dismissed a day later and replaced by then Castilla coach, Santiago Solari.[157] On 22 December 2018, Real Madrid beat Al Ain 4–1 in the FIFA Club World Cup and became the outright record winners of the Club World Cup with four titles.[158] However, they were then knocked out of the Copa del Rey at the semi-final stage by Barcelona, losing 1–4 on aggregate. On 5 March 2019, Real was defeated by Ajax 1–4 (3–5 on aggregate) at home, crashing out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage after eight consecutive semi-finals appearances. On 11 March 2019, Real Madrid dismissed Solari and reinstated Zidane as the head coach of the club.[159] Madrid finished the season with 68 points and a +17 goal difference, its lowest totals since 2001–02 and 1999–2000 respectively.[160] In the summer of 2019, Madrid signed Eden Hazard, Luka Jović, Éder Militão, Ferland Mendy, Rodrygo, Reinier and other players for a total of more than €350 million.[161] On 12 January 2020, Madrid beat cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid in a penalty shootout in the Supercopa de España final to win their eleventh title.[162] After a three-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, La Liga was restarted in June and Madrid won ten games in a row to capture the team's 34th league title, collecting 87 points in total.[163] From the competition's resumption in June and until the end of the 2020–21 season, Real temporarily played home fixtures at the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium, while the Santiago Bernabéu underwent extensive renovations.[164][165] Zidane left a second time on 27 May 2021 after going trophyless that season,[166] with Carlo Ancelotti returning to coach the team for the 2021–22 season.[167] On the domestic front, he delivered two trophies out of possible three, winning La Liga and the Supercopa de España.[168][169][170] As such, Ancelotti won all six available top trophies at Madrid.[171] In the Champions League, Madrid produced one of the most memorable runs of all time,[172] defeating pre-tournament favourites Paris Saint-Germain,[173][174] defending champions and favourites Chelsea,[175] Premier League champions and heavy favourites Manchester City,[176] all in dramatic fashion,[177] and setting up the final against Liverpool, who were once again widely considered as favourites,[178] in a rematch of their 2018 encounter. A lone Vinícius Júnior goal sealed the 14th European Cup for Los Blancos, their fifth in nine years, and Ancelotti's second in charge.[179][180] Real also claimed their fourth ever European double (after 1956–57, 1957–58, and 2016–17). Despite Real's status as the most decorated team in the history of the Champions League, they were not favoured to win that year's edition, and their improbable run was widely considered a surprise.[181] After a highly successful 2021–22 season, Real Madrid signed German defender Antonio Rüdiger and French midfielder Aurélien Tchouaméni, while club legends Marcelo, Isco, Gareth Bale and Casemiro left the club. Real Madrid's 2022–23 season began with lifting the UEFA Super Cup and later the FIFA Club World Cup. The season ended with Real Madrid winning the 2022–23 Copa del Rey, but losing the La Liga and Spanish Super Cup to FC Barcelona and the Champions League to Manchester City, being defeated 5–1 on aggregate. In 2023, Real Madrid signed Jude Bellingham, who was given the number #5 jersey, previously used by Zinedine Zidane. Real also signed Arda Güler and Fran García. Meanwhile, Vinícius Júnior was given the number #7 jersey, previously used by Raúl and Cristiano Ronaldo; while Rodrygo was given the number #11 jersey, previously used by Gareth Bale. Karim Benzema left the club, while Toni Kroos would later announce that he would retire from football after this season. The 2023-24 season would prove to be another highly successful season for Los Blancos. First, Real Madrid lifted the Spanish Super Cup against Barcelona 4–1, taking revenge of the previous year's 3–0 defeat. Then, Real Madrid lifted the La Liga with relative ease, reaching 95 points, the second-best winning campaign by Real Madrid in La Liga history after the 2011–12 100 points season. In the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League, Real Madrid knocked out RB Leipzig in the Round of 16, then defending champions Manchester City in penalties. In the semifinals, Real Madrid faced Bayern Munich again. The first match was a 2–2 draw, while the second match in the Bernabéu was marked by a double by Joselu in the last few minutes of the game, with Bayern Munich suffering a historic comeback after leading 1–0. Real Madrid faced Borussia Dortmund in the final, and won 2–0, with Dani Carvajal being the man of the match and scoring with a header after a Toni Kroos corner, and Vinícius Júnior once again scoring in a UCL final. Real Madrid won their 15th Champions League without losing a single match during the campaign. Following the conclusion of the 2023–24 season, Real Madrid announced that striker Kylian Mbappé would be joining the club on a free transfer from Paris Saint-Germain in July 2024, concluding one of the most highly anticipated transfer sagas in modern history.[182] On 18 December 2024, Real Madrid clinched their second trophy of the season, uplifting the inaugural 2024 FIFA Intercontinental Cup by beating Pachuca 3-0.[183] The first crest had a simple design consisting of a decorative interlacing of the three initials of the club, \"MCF\" for Madrid Club de Fútbol, in dark blue on a white shirt. The first change in the crest occurred in 1908 when the letters adopted a more streamlined form and appeared inside a circle.[184] The next change in the configuration of the crest did not occur until the presidency of Pedro Parages in 1920. At that time, King Alfonso XIII granted the club his royal patronage which came in the form of the title \"Real Madrid,\" meaning \"Royal.\"[185] Thus, Alfonso's crown was added to the crest and the club styled itself Real Madrid Club de Fútbol.[184] With the dissolution of the monarchy in 1931, all royal symbols (the crown on the crest and the title of Real) were eliminated. The crown was replaced by the dark mulberry band of the Region of Castile.[49] In 1941, two years after Nationalist victory in the Civil War, the Francoist regime restored the crest's \"Real Corona\", or \"Royal Crown\", while the mulberry stripe of Castile was retained as well.[186][57] In addition, the whole crest was made full color, with gold being the most prominent, and the club went back to its honorific name Real Madrid Club de Fútbol.[184] The most recent modification to the crest occurred in 2001 when the club wanted to better situate itself for the 21st century and further standardize its crest. One of the modifications made was changing the mulberry stripe to a more bluish shade.[184] Real Madrid has maintained the white shirt for its home kit throughout the history of the club. There was, however, one season that the shirt and shorts were not both white. It was an initiative undertaken by Juan Padrós in honour of an English team Corinthian, which he had met on one of his trips, one of the most famous teams at the time known for its elegance and sportsmanship.[44] It was decided that Real Madrid would wear black shorts in an attempt to replicate the English team, which had also inspired Madrid's original white kit, but the initiative lasted just one year. After being eliminated from the cup by Barcelona with a 1–5 defeat in Madrid and a 2–0 defeat in Catalonia, President Parages decided to return to an all-white kit, claiming that the other kit brought bad luck.[note 3] By the early 1940s, the manager changed the kit again by adding buttons to the shirt and the club's crest on the left breast, which has remained ever since. On 23 November 1947, in a game against Atlético Madrid at the Metropolitano Stadium, Real Madrid became the first Spanish team to wear numbered shirts.[57] English club Leeds United permanently switched their blue shirt for a white one in the 1960s, to emulate the dominant Real Madrid of the era.[187] Real's traditional away colours are all blue or all purple. Since the advent of the replica kit market, the club has also released various other one colour designs, including red, green, orange and black. The club's kit is manufactured by Adidas, whose contract extends from 1998.[188][189] Real Madrid's first shirt sponsor, Zanussi, agreed for the 1982–83, 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons. Following that, the club was sponsored by Parmalat and Otaysa before a long-term deal was signed with Teka in 1992.[190][191] In 2001, Real Madrid ended their contract with Teka and for one season and used the Realmadrid.com logo to promote the club's website. Then, in 2002, a deal was signed with Siemens and in 2006, the BenQ Siemens logo appeared on the club's shirt.[192] Real Madrid's shirt sponsor from 2007 until 2013 was bwin.com following the economic problems of BenQ Siemens.[193][194] Fly Emirates became their shirt sponsor in 2013, and in 2017 the club renewed the sponsorship with the airliner, signing a deal until 2022 worth €70 million per year.[195] In 2022, the agreement was again extended, until 2026.[196] In 2015, Madrid signed a new ten-year contract with Adidas, believed to be worth a total of £850 million (€1 billion), with the club earning £59 million (€64 million) per season. The contract includes a clause sanctioning penalty or agreement termination anytime, if Real Madrid fails to qualify for the European competitions or is relegated from La Liga.[197] Note: early termination clauses can be activated at any time depending on the team's performance. After moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912, which remained its home stadium for 11 years.[46] After this period, the club moved for one year to the Campo de Ciudad Lineal, a small ground with a capacity of 8,000 spectators. After that, Real Madrid started playing its home matches at the Estadio Chamartín, which was inaugurated on 17 May 1923 with a match against Newcastle United.[203] In this stadium, which hosted 22,500 spectators, Real Madrid celebrated its first Spanish league title.[48] Following his election in 1943, president Santiago Bernabéu decided that the Chamartín was not big enough for the ambitions of the club, and thus a new stadium was built and inaugurated on 14 December 1947.[57][204] Initially knows as Nuevo Chamartín, the stadium was renamed in honour of Bernabéu in 1955 and continues to bear his name to this day.[58] The first match at the Bernabéu was played between Madrid and the Portuguese club Belenenses, with Los Blancos winning 3–1 and Sabino Barinaga scoring the first goal.[57] The capacity has changed frequently, peaking at 120,000 after a 1953 expansion.[205] Since then, there have been a number of reductions due to modernizations (the last standing areas were removed in 1998–99 in response to UEFA regulations which had forbidden standing at matches in European competitions), countered to some extent by expansions.[205] The current capacity is 81,044 spectators. Real Madrid has the fourth-highest average attendance in Europe, behind Borussia Dortmund, Barcelona and Manchester United.[206][207][208][209] The Bernabéu has hosted the 1964 UEFA European Championship final, the 1982 FIFA World Cup final, and the 1957, 1969, 1980 and 2010 European Cup/Champions League finals.[210] The stadium has its own namesake Madrid Metro station along the 10 line.[211] On 14 November 2007, the Bernabéu was upgraded to Elite Football Stadium status by UEFA.[212] On 9 May 2006, the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium, named after club legend Alfredo Di Stéfano, was inaugurated in the Real Madrid City, where Real Madrid usually trains. The inaugural match was played between Real Madrid and Reims, a rematch of the 1956 European Cup final. Real Madrid 6–1, with goals from Sergio Ramos, Antonio Cassano (2), Roberto Soldado (2) and José Manuel Jurado. The venue is now part of the Ciudad Real Madrid, the club's training facility located outside Madrid, in Valdebebas. The stadium's capacity is 5,000 people, and it is Real Madrid Castilla's home ground.[213] For the latter part of the 2019–20 season and throughout the 2020–21 season, the stadium hosted the first team's home games due to a combination of the COVID-19 pandemic-triggered restrictions and an extensive renovation of the Santiago Bernabéu.[214][165] The latest renovation of the Santiago Bernabéu is set to increase the capacity by approximately 4,000 with the addition of an extra tier, bringing it to nearly 85,000.[215][216] Furthermore, the height will also be increased by ten metres and a retractable roof, a retractable pitch and a 360-degree screen will be installed.[217][218] The works have started in 2019, and the renovated stadium was initially planned to be unveiled in 2022; however, the COVID-19 pandemic and Russian invasion of Ukraine caused significant disruption to supply chains, prompting the club to postpone the stadium's inauguration to 2023.[219][220] Raúl holds the record for most appearances with Real Madrid, with 741 appearances from 1994 to 2010. Iker Casillas comes second with 725 appearances, followed by Manuel Sanchis Jr., having played 710 times.[221] The record for a goalkeeper is held by Iker Casillas, with 725 appearances. With 63 goals, Cristiano Ronaldo has scored the most international goals while playing for the club. Meanwhile, Sergio Ramos has accumulated the most caps while playing for the club, with 176. Cristiano Ronaldo (2009–2018) is Real Madrid's all-time top goalscorer, with 450 goals in 438 matches.[222][223] Six other players have also scored over 200 goals for Real: Alfredo Di Stéfano (1953–1964), Santillana (1971–1988), Ferenc Puskás (1958–1966), Hugo Sánchez (1985–1992), Karim Benzema (2009–2023) and the previous goalscoring record-holder Raúl (1994–2010). Cristiano Ronaldo also holds the record for the most league goals scored in one season (48 in 2014–15), alongside being Real's top goalscorer of all time in La Liga history with 311 goals. Di Stéfano's 49 goals in 58 matches was for decades the all-time highest tally in the European Cup, until it was surpassed by Raúl in 2005, and is now held by Cristiano Ronaldo with 105 goals for Madrid and 140 overall. The fastest goal in the history of the club (13 seconds) was scored by the Chilean Iván Zamorano on 3 September 1994 during a league match against Sevilla.[224] Officially, the highest home attendance figure for a Real Madrid match is 129,690, which was for a European Cup match in 1956 against Milan. The current official capacity of the Santiago Bernabéu is 80,000.[225] Real has also set records in Spanish football, most notably the most domestic titles (36 as of 2023–24) and the most seasons won in a row (five, during 1960–65 and 1985–90).[1] With 121 matches (from 17 February 1957 to 7 March 1965), the club holds the record for longest unbeaten run at home in La Liga.[226] The club also holds the record for winning the European Cup/UEFA Champions League fifteen times[227] and for the most semi-finals appearances (33). As of June 2024, Cristiano Ronaldo is the all-time top scorer in the UEFA Champions League, with 140 (141 including qualifiers) goals in total, 105 while playing for Real Madrid. The team has the record number of consecutive participations in the European Cup (before it became the Champions League) with 15, from 1955–56 to 1969–70.[228] Among the club's on-field records is a 22-game winning streak in all competitions during the 2014–15 season, a Spanish record. In September 2017, the club equalled the record of the Brazilian club Santos, starring Pelé, by scoring in their 73rd consecutive game, before Bayern Munich breaks the record in 2021.[229] In June 2009, the club broke its own record for the highest transfer fee ever paid in the history of football after purchasing Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo for €94 million (£80 million).[230][231] The fee of €77.5 million (100 billion lire) for Zinedine Zidane's transfer from Juventus to Real Madrid in 2001 was the previous highest transfer fee ever paid. This record (in pounds sterling) had been broken previously in June 2009, for a few days, when Real Madrid agreed to buy Kaká from Milan for €67 million (£65 million). The transfer of Tottenham Hotspur's Gareth Bale in 2013 was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer fee approximated at around €100 million.[111] In January 2016, documents pertaining to Bale's transfer were leaked which confirmed a world record transfer fee of €100,759,418.[232] Real Madrid equalled their record signing in 2019, when the club signed Eden Hazard from Chelsea for a reported €115 million.[233] The club's record sale occurred on 10 July 2018, when Juventus signed Cristiano Ronaldo for €117 million.[234] During most home matches, the majority of the seats in the stadium are occupied by season-ticket holders, of which the figure is capped at 65,000.[235] To become a season ticket holder one must first be a socio, or club member. In addition to members, the club has more than 1,800 peñas (official, club-affiliated supporters' groups) in Spain and around the world. Real Madrid has the second highest average all-time attendance in Spanish football and regularly attracts over 74,000 fans to the Bernabéu. One of the best supported teams globally, Real Madrid was the first sports team (and first brand) to reach 100 million fans on Facebook in April 2017.[236][237] Real Madrid's hardcore supporters are the so-called Ultras Sur supporters, or simply Ultras. They are known for their extreme right-wing politics, akin to Barcelona's hardcore supporters group Boixos Nois. The Ultras Surs have developed an alliance with other right wing groups, most notably Lazio Irriducibili fans, and have also developed an alliance with left-wing groups. On several occasions, they have racially abused opposing players, and have been investigated by UEFA for doing so.[238][239] Florentino Pérez took it upon himself to ban the Ultras from the Bernabéu and assign their seats to the general public. This decision was controversial with some of the Bernabéu faithful, however, as the lively atmosphere of games would suffer as a result.[240][241] The Ultras have since held protests outside the Bernabéu and have demanded to be reinstated and allowed to enter the grounds.[242] Questioned over Pope Francis' adherence to 2014 FIFA Club World Cup Final opponents San Lorenzo, Madrid captain Sergio Ramos stated: \"In the semi-finals we noticed the love from supporters in Marrakesh and it seemed like we were playing at home. That sums up the greatness of this team. Madrid is God's team and the team of the world\".[243] Among the club's famous supporters is golfer Sergio García, who was invited to take the honorary kickoff for El Clásico at the Bernabeu wearing his green jacket from winning the 2017 Masters.[244] There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Real Madrid and Barcelona is known as \"The Classic\" (El Clásico). From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Castile and Catalonia, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between the Castilians and Catalans, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.[245] Over the years, the record for Real Madrid and Barcelona is 105 victories for Madrid, 101 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws as at December 2024.[246] As early as the 1930s, Barcelona \"had developed a reputation as a symbol of Catalan identity, opposed to the centralising tendencies of Madrid\".[248][249] During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera and especially Francisco Franco, all regional languages and identities in Spain were frowned upon and restrained. As such, most citizens of Barcelona were in strong opposition to Franco's regime. In that period, Barcelona gained their motto Més que un club (English: More than a club) because of its alleged connection to Catalan nationalist as well as to progressive beliefs.[250] There is an ongoing controversy as to what extent Franco's rule (1939–75) influenced the activities and on-pitch results of both Barcelona and Real Madrid. Fans of both clubs tend to exaggerate the myths favouring their narratives. Most historians agree that Franco did not have a preferred football team, but his Spanish nationalist beliefs led him to associate himself with the establishment teams, such as Atlético Aviación and Madrid FC (that recovered its \"royal\" name after the fall of the Republic and again became Real Madrid). On the other hand, he also wanted the renamed Barcelona succeed as \"Spanish team\", rather than a Catalan one. During the early years of Franco's rule, Real Madrid were not particularly successful, winning two Copa del Generalísimo titles and a Copa Eva Duarte; Barcelona claimed three league titles, one Copa del Generalísimo and one Copa Eva Duarte. During that period, Atlético Aviación were believed to be the preferred team over Real Madrid. The most contested stories of the period include Real Madrid's 11–1 home win against Barcelona in the Copa del Generalísimo, where the Catalan team alleged intimidation, and the controversial transfer of Alfredo Di Stéfano to Real Madrid, despite his agreement with Barcelona. The latter transfer was part of Real Madrid chairman Santiago Bernabéu's \"revolution\" that ushered in the era of unprecedented dominance. Bernabéu, himself a veteran of the Civil War who fought for Franco's forces, saw Real Madrid on top, not only of Spanish, but also European football, helping create the European Cup, the first true competition for Europe's best club sides. His vision was fulfilled when Real Madrid not only started winning consecutive league titles, but also swept the first five editions of the European Cup in the 1950s.[251] These events had a profound impact on Spanish football and influenced Franco's attitude. According to historians, during this time he realized the importance of Real Madrid for his regime's international image, and the club became his preferred team until his death. Fernando Maria Castiella, who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs under Franco from 1957 until 1969, noted that \"[Real Madrid] is the best embassy we have ever had\". Franco died in 1975, and the Spanish transition to democracy soon followed. Under his rule, Real Madrid had won 14 league titles, six Copa del Generalísimo titles, one Copa Eva Duarte, six European Cups, two Latin Cups and one Intercontinental Cup. In the same period, Barcelona had won eight league titles, nine Copa del Generalísimo titles, three Copa Eva Duarte titles, three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups and two Latin Cups.[252][186] The rivalry was intensified during the 1950s when the clubs disputed the signing of Alfredo Di Stéfano. Di Stéfano had impressed both Barcelona and Real Madrid while playing for Los Millonarios in Bogotá, Colombia, during a players' strike in his native Argentina. Soon after Millonarios' return to Colombia, Barcelona directors visited Buenos Aires and agreed with River Plate, the last FIFA-affiliated team to have held Di Stéfano's rights, for his transfer in 1954 for the equivalent of 150 million Italian lira (according to other sources 200,000 dollars). This started a battle between the two Spanish rivals for his rights. FIFA appointed Armando Muñoz Calero, former president of the Spanish Football Federation as mediator. Calero decided to let Di Stéfano play the 1953–54 and 1955–56 seasons in Madrid, and the 1954–55 and 1956–57 seasons in Barcelona. The agreement was approved by the Football Association and their respective clubs. Although the Catalans agreed, the decision created various discontent among the Blaugrana members and the president was forced to resign in September 1953. Barcelona sold Madrid their half-share, and Di Stéfano moved to Los Blancos, signing a four-year contract. Real paid 5.5 million Spanish pesetas for the transfer, plus a 1.3 million bonus for the purchase, an annual fee to be paid to the Millonarios, and a 16,000 salary for Di Stéfano with a bonus double that of his teammates, for a total of 40% of the annual revenue of the Madrid club.[253] Di Stéfano became integral in the subsequent success achieved by Real Madrid, scoring twice in his first game against Barcelona. With him, Madrid won the first five editions of the European Cup.[254] The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when Real Madrid and Barcelona met twice in the European Cup, with Madrid triumphing en route to their fifth consecutive title in 1959–60 and Barcelona prevailing en route to losing the final in 1960–61. Ahead of the 1973–74 season, Johan Cruyff arrived to Barcelona for a world record £920,000 from Ajax.[255] Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Francisco Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son \"Jordi\", after the local Catalan Saint George.[256] In 2002, the European encounter between the clubs was dubbed the \"Match of The Century\" by Spanish media, and Madrid's win was watched by more than 500 million people around the world.[257] A fixture known for its intensity and indiscipline, it has also featured memorable goal celebrations from both teams, often involving mocking the opposition.[258] In October 1999, Real Madrid forward Raúl silenced 100,000 Barcelona fans at the Camp Nou when he scored before he celebrated by putting a finger to his lips as if telling the crowd to be quiet.[258][259] In 2009, Barcelona captain Carles Puyol kissed his Catalan armband in front of Madrid fans at the Bernabéu.[258] Cristiano Ronaldo twice gestured to the hostile crowd to \"calm down\" after scoring against Barcelona at the Camp Nou in 2012 and 2016.[258] In April 2017, Messi celebrated his 93rd-minute winner for Barcelona against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu by taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans – with his name and number facing them.[258] Later that year, in August, Ronaldo was subbed on in the first leg of the Supercopa de España, proceeded to score in the 80th minute and took his shirt off before holding it up to Barça's fans with his name and number facing them.[260] The club's nearest neighbour is Atlético Madrid, a rivalry being shared between fans of both football teams. Although Atlético was founded by three Basque students in 1903, it was joined in 1904 by dissident members of \"Madrid FC\". The two teams met for the first time on 2 December 1906 in the regional championship, with Real Madrid winning 2–1. Their first league meeting came on 21 February 1929 in matchday three of the first league championship at the former Chamartín. It was the first official derby of the new tournament, and Real won 2–1.[48] After the Civil War, during the early Francoist period, Atlético became associated with the military air force (and thus renamed Atlético Aviación), although the alleged preference of the regime for the club is subject to discussion. In any case, during this period Atlético became the most successful club in Spain, reducing the historical gap between the two clubs, until the regime preference shifted towards Real Madrid in the 1950s, as Franco sought to make political capital out of Real Madrid's multiple European Cup titles at a time when Spain was internationally isolated; one minister said, \"Real Madrid are the best ambassadors we've ever had.\"[186] Thus, Atlético fans regularly chanted that Real were \"El equipo del gobierno, la vergüenza del país\" – \"The team of the government, the shame of the country\" – and allegedly adopted a more left-wing slant (tempered by the rise of ultras culture and Rayo Vallecano's presence as the \"true\" leftist club in Madrid).[261][262] The rivalry first gained international attention in 1959 during the European Cup when the two clubs met in the semi-finals. Real won the first leg 2–1 at the Santiago Bernabéu, while Atlético won 1–0 at the Metropolitano. The tie went to a replay, which Real won 2–1. Atlético, however, gained some revenge when, led by former Real Madrid coach José Villalonga, it defeated its city rivals in two successive Copa del Generalísimo finals in 1960 and 1961.[263] In the 1970s, Atlético again took the lead as the most successful Spanish club of the decade, which prompted the Real Madrid fanbase to look down on Atlético calling them and their supporters \"Indios\" (Indians, a reference to the Latin American players signed by the Red-and-whites).[264] By then, Real Madrid did not want to sign non-Caucasian players (president Santiago Bernabéu even stated, when he decided not to sign Portuguese star Eusebio at the end of the 1960s, \"Mientras yo viva, aquí no jugará ningún negro ni un blanco con bigote\" (\"As long as I live, no black or white with a mustache will play here\").[265] Atlético's supporters accepted the new \"Indian\" nickname joyfully and have been using it until today. The Santiago Bernabéu, Real Madrid's stadium, is alongside banks and businesses on the upper class Paseo de la Castellana street, while the Vicente Calderón (the stadium that Atlético Madrid used until the 2016–17 season) could be found near a brewery, alongside the Manzanares River and a motorway. Real draw greater support all across the region because of their historically greater resources and success, while Atlético have a relatively working class fan base mainly from the south of the city, with some fans also scattered throughout the city.[266][267] In fact, the Atlético crest includes the Coat of arms of Madrid, whereas Real crest has no such a reference to the city (instead, it includes a reference to the broader Castile region). Between 1961 and 1989, when Real dominated La Liga, only Atlético offered it any serious challenge, winning league titles in 1966, 1970, 1973 and 1977. In 1965, Atlético became the first team to beat Real at the Bernabéu in eight years. Real Madrid's record against Atlético in more recent times has been favourable.[268] A high point came in the 2002–03 season, when Real clinched the La Liga title after a 4–0 victory at the Vicente Calderón. Atlético's first win over its city rivals since 1999 came in the Copa del Rey final in May 2013. In 2013–14, Real and Atlético were finalists of the UEFA Champions League, the first final which hosted two clubs from the same city. Real Madrid triumphed with a 4–1 comeback victory in extra time.[269] On 7 February 2015, Real suffered their first defeat in 14 years at the Vicente Calderón, a 4–0 loss.[270] On 28 May 2016, Real and Atlético again met for the Champions League title, which resulted in a win for Real after a penalty shootout at San Siro.[271] A further minor rivalry exists between Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao. This is known as El Viejo Clásico (the old classic),[272] so named as the two clubs were dominant in the first half of the 20th century, meeting in nine Copa del Rey finals including the first in 1903.[273][274] Until 10 December 2011, this fixture was the most played in the history of Spanish football, when it was surpassed by El Clásico.[275] Athletic Bilbao, who operate a policy of only using local players,[276] have long since ceased to be a competitive rival to clubs such as Real Madrid who scour the globe for the best talent; the Lions won only two of the 26 matches between the teams from 2005–06 to 2016–17.[272][277][278] However, the matches remain keenly fought due to their historical and cultural significance, with some parallels to the political aspect of the Barcelona/Catalonia rivalry as Athletic are the largest club in the Basque region.[279][262][280] Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are two of the most successful clubs in the UEFA Champions League/European Cup competition, with Real winning 15 times and Bayern winning six times.[281][282] Although they have never met in a final, Real Madrid versus Bayern is the match that has historically been played most often in the Champions League/European Cup with 26 matches (twelve wins for Madrid, eleven wins for Bayern, with three draws),[283] with several controversial incidents occurring due to the great importance of most of their meetings.[284][285][286] Real Madrid supporters often refer to Bayern as the \"Bestia negra\" (\"Black Beast\"). During the 2010s, the two teams met in the 2011–12 Champions League semi-finals, which ended 3–3 on aggregate (Bayern won 3–1 on penalties after extra time, but lost the final at their own stadium by the same method), then at the same stage in the 2013–14 edition with Real Madrid winning 5–0 on aggregate,[287] and again in 2017–18 with the Spanish club progressing 4–3;[288] both times they went on to win the competition. Another match that is often played in the European Cup/Champions League is Real Madrid vs Juventus, the most decorated Italian club. They have played each other in 21 matches and have an almost perfectly balanced record (nine wins for Juventus, ten wins for Real Madrid and two draws), as well as nearly the same goal difference (Madrid ahead 26 to 25).[289][290][291] Their first meeting was in the quarter-finals of the 1961–62 European Cup, which Real Madrid won 3–1 in a replay held in Paris.[290] At the quarter-final stage in 1995–96, Juventus prevailed 2–1 over the two legs and went on to lift the trophy.[290] In the 1998 UEFA Champions League Final between the teams in Amsterdam, Real Madrid won 1–0.[290][292] They met again in the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, when both clubs were in their respective 'golden eras'; Juventus won 4–3 on aggregate.[290] By that time, star midfielder Zinedine Zidane, who played for the Bianconeri in the 1998 final, had moved from Turin to Madrid in a world record €77 million deal.[293] The teams met again in the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League group stage, with Madrid winning 2–1 at home and drawing 2–2 away en route to their tenth title. In the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, former Real Madrid player Álvaro Morata scored one goal in each leg to take Juventus to the final, winning 3–2 on aggregate, while Cristiano Ronaldo scored both goals for Madrid.[290] They faced off again in the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final in Cardiff, with Ronaldo scoring twice as Real Madrid won 4–1.[290][294][295] The latest Champions League meeting was in the 2017–18 quarter-finals, which Real Madrid won 4–3 on aggregate; the tie ended in dramatic and controversial fashion, with a debatable penalty awarded to Real Madrid in the last minute of the second leg after Juventus built a 3–0 lead at the Bernabeu to pull level in the tie following a defeat at the Allianz Stadium by the same scoreline.[296][297] Cristiano Ronaldo scored three goals over the two matches including the decisive penalty and a spectacular overhead kick,[298] and having won the Champions League with Madrid for a fourth time,[299] he transferred to Juventus a few months later for a €117 million fee.[300] It was under Florentino Pérez's first presidency (2000–2006) that Real Madrid started its ambition of becoming the world's richest professional football club.[301] The club ceded part of its training grounds to the city of Madrid in 2001, and sold the rest to four corporations: Repsol YPF, Mutua Automovilística de Madrid, Sacyr Vallehermoso and OHL. The sale eradicated the club's debts, paving the way for it to buy the world's most expensive players, such as Zinedine Zidane, Luís Figo, Ronaldo and David Beckham. The city had previously rezoned the training grounds for development, a move which in turn increased their value, and then bought the site.[79] The European Commission started an investigation into whether the city overpaid for the property, to be considered a form of state subsidy.[302] The sale of the training ground for office buildings cleared Real Madrid's debts of €270 million and enabled the club to embark upon an unprecedented spending spree which brought big-name players to the club. In addition, profit from the sale was spent on a state-of-the-art training complex on the city's outskirts.[303] Although Pérez's policy resulted in increased financial success from the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, especially in Asia, it came under increasing criticism for being too focused on marketing the Real Madrid brand and not enough on the performances of the team.[82] By September 2007, Real Madrid was considered the most valuable football brand in Europe by BBDO. In 2008, it was ranked the second-most valuable club in world football, at €951 million (£640 million / $1.285 billion),[304] only beaten by Manchester United, which was valued at €1.333 billion (£900 million).[305] In 2010, Real Madrid had the highest turnover in football worldwide.[306] In September 2009, Real Madrid's management announced plans to open the club's own dedicated theme park by 2013.[307] A study at Harvard University concluded that Real Madrid \"is one of the 20 most important brand names and the only one in which its executives, the players, are well-known. We have some spectacular figures in regard to worldwide support of the club. There are an estimated 287 million people worldwide who follow Real Madrid.\"[308] In 2010, Forbes evaluated Real Madrid's worth to be around €992 million (US$1.323 billion), ranking them second only to Manchester United, based on figures from the 2008–09 season.[309][310] According to Deloitte, Real Madrid had a recorded revenue of €401 million in the same period, ranking first.[311] Along with Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao and Osasuna, Real Madrid is organised as a registered association. This means that the club is owned by its supporters, who elect the president. The president cannot invest his own money,[312] and the club can only spend what it earns, which is mainly derived through sponsorships, commercial partnerships, merchandise sales, television rights, prize money and ticket sales. Unlike a limited company, it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only a membership.[313] The members of Real Madrid, called \"socios\", form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club.[314] As of 2010, the club had 60,000 socios.[315] At the end of the 2009–10 season, the club's board of directors stated that Real Madrid had a net debt of €244.6 million, €82.1 million lower than the previous fiscal year. Real Madrid announced that it had a net debt of €170 million after the 2010–11 season. From 2007 to 2011, the club made a net profit of €190 million.[316][317] During the 2009–10 season, Real Madrid made €150 million through ticket sales, the most of any club in top-flight football.[316] Real Madrid has the highest number of shirt sales per season, around 1.5 million.[316] For the 2010–11 season, Madrid's wage bill totalled €169 million, which was second-highest in Europe behind Barcelona;[318] furthermore, its wage bill to turnover ratio was the best in Europe at 43 percent, ahead of Manchester United and Arsenal at 46 percent and 50 percent, respectively. In 2013, Forbes listed the club as the world's most valuable sports team, worth $3.3 billion.[319] Real Madrid was valued at €3.47 billion ($4.1 billion) in 2018, and in the 2016–17 season it was the second highest-earning football club in the world, with an annual revenue of €674.6 million.[320] In November 2018, the average first-team pay at Madrid was £8.1m ($10.6m) per year, making it the second-highest paid sports team in the world after Barcelona.[321][322] In 2022, Forbes listed Real Madrid as the most valuable football club in the world, at $5.1 billion.[323] Real Madrid was the featured club in the second installment of the Goal! football movie trilogy, Goal! 2: Living the Dream... (2007). The film follows former Newcastle United star Santiago Muñez as he is first scouted and then signed by Real Madrid for the 2005–06 season. The film's creators wanted to put emphasis on the changes in Muñez's life after his move to Madrid. Production was done with the full support of UEFA, allowing the film crew to use many real life players in cameo roles. Real Madrid squad members featured in the film included Iker Casillas, Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Raúl, Sergio Ramos, Robinho, Michael Owen, Míchel Salgado, Júlio Baptista, Steve McManaman and Iván Helguera. Non-Real Madrid players to make cameo appearances included Ronaldinho, Thierry Henry, Lionel Messi, Samuel Eto'o, Andrés Iniesta, Pablo Aimar, Freddie Ljungberg, Cesc Fàbregas and Santiago Cañizares. In the film, both Florentino Pérez and Alfredo Di Stéfano presented the fictional player Muñez to the club after his signing.[324] Real, The Movie is a 2005 part feature, part documentary film that showcases the worldwide passion for Real Madrid. Produced by the club and directed by Borja Manso, it follows five sub-stories of fans from around the world and their love for the club. Along with the fictional portion of the film, it also contains real footage of the squad, during training at Ciudad Real Madrid, matches, and interviews. Although the film mentions all of the squad, it mainly focuses on galácticos such as David Beckham, Zinedine Zidane, Raúl, Luís Figo, Ronaldo, Iker Casillas and Roberto Carlos, among others. The film was originally produced in Spanish, but has been dubbed for their worldwide fanbase. The book White Storm: 100 years of Real Madrid by Phil Ball was the first English-language history of Real Madrid. Published in 2002, it talks about the most successful moments of the club during its first centenary, having been translated into various languages. In late 2011, Real Madrid released a digital music album, entitled Legends, and a remix of the club's anthem, \"Himno del Real Madrid,\" was released as the first single from the album.[325] Real Madrid TV is an encrypted digital television channel, operated by Real Madrid and specialising in the club. The channel is available in Spanish and English. It is located at Ciudad Real Madrid in Valdebebas (Madrid), Real Madrid's training centre. Hala Madrid is a magazine published quarterly for the Real Madrid club members and the Madridistas Fan Club card holders.[326] The phrase Hala Madrid, meaning \"Forward Madrid\" or \"Go Madrid\", is also the title of the club's official anthem, which is often sung by the Madridistas (the club's fans).[6] The magazine includes reports on the club's matches in the previous month, as well as information about the reserve and youth teams. Features often include interviews with players, both past and present, and the club's historic matches.[326] Real Madrid has appeared in many football-based video games, namely in the FIFA, EA Sports FC, and Pro Evolution Soccer series. A Real Madrid player has appeared on the cover of both titles a combined seven times. In 2007, Spanish game publisher Virgin Play signed a deal with the club to make officially licensed Real Madrid video games. The only one released under the deal (due to Virgin Play's liquidation in September 2009) would end up being Real Madrid: The Game, which was developed by Atomic Planet Entertainment and was published under Virgin Play's publishing division V.2 Play in May 2009 for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Windows, Wii and Nintendo DS exclusively in European territories Virgin Play released their products in. The game featured a career mode with a mixture of role-playing and simulation as well as arcade-styled Football gameplay. Spanish teams are limited to three players without EU citizenship. The squad list includes only the principal nationality of each player; several non-European players on the squad have dual citizenship with an EU country. Also, players from the ACP countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement are not counted against non-EU quotas due to the Kolpak ruling.

                "content": "Jimmy Butler III (born September 14, 1989) is an American professional basketball player for the Miami Heat of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed \"Jimmy Buckets\", he is a six-time NBA All-Star, a five-time All-NBA Team member, and a five-time NBA All-Defensive Team member. He won a gold medal as a member of the 2016 U.S. Olympic team. Butler played one year of college basketball for Tyler Junior College before transferring to Marquette University. He was selected with the 30th overall pick in the 2011 NBA draft by the Chicago Bulls. In 2015, he was named the NBA Most Improved Player. After six seasons in Chicago, he was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves in June 2017, and was then again traded in November 2018, this time to the Philadelphia 76ers. In July 2019, he signed with the Heat. During his first season with the team, Butler reached the NBA Finals. In 2021, he led the league in steals. In 2023, Butler and the eighth-seeded Heat played in the 2023 NBA Finals, their second appearance in four years.[1][2] Butler was born in Houston on September 14, 1989.[3][4] His father, Jimmy Butler Jr., left the family when Butler was an infant. When he was 13 years old and living in the Houston suburb of Tomball, his mother kicked him out of the house. As Butler remembered it in a 2011 interview, she told him, \"I don't like the look of you. You gotta go.\" He moved between the homes of various friends, staying for a few weeks at a time before moving to another house.[5] Butler maintains a relationship with his parents, saying, \"I don't hold grudges. I still talk to my family. My mom. My father. We love each other. That's never going to change.\"[6][7] In a summer basketball league before his senior year at Tomball High School, he was noticed by Jordan Leslie, a freshman football and basketball player at the school, who challenged him to a three-point shooting contest. The two became friends, and Butler stayed at Leslie's house for a few months, Leslie's mother and stepfather had six other children between them. Butler would later say, \"They accepted me into their family. And it wasn't because of basketball. She [Michelle Lambert, Leslie's mother] was just very loving. She just did stuff like that. I couldn't believe it.\"[5] As a junior at Tomball High, Butler averaged 10 points per game. As a senior and team captain in 2006–07, Butler averaged 19.9 points and 8.7 rebounds per game and was subsequently voted his team's most valuable player. Butler was not recruited coming out of high school and chose to attend Tyler Junior College in Tyler, Texas. After his freshman season at Tyler Junior College, where he had averaged 18.1 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 3.1 assists per game, Butler received interest from Division I programs. Considered a two-star recruit by 247Sports.com,[8] he was listed as the No. 127 junior college prospect in 2008.[9] Butler accepted an athletic scholarship to attend Marquette, where, as a sophomore in the 2008–09 season, he averaged 5.6 points and 3.9 rebounds per game and recorded a free-throw percentage of 76.8%.

Butler ended with 11 rebounds as the Bulls overcame a seven-point deficit in the final three minutes.[44] On January 2, 2017, Butler scored 52 points in a 118–111 win over the Charlotte Hornets. He was a point shy of his career high and scored 20 points in the first half and 17 in the game's final four minutes.

He finished with three points on 1-for-13 shooting.[49] On February 25, 2017, he recorded his third career triple-double with 18 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in a 117–99 win over the Cleveland

usual starters.[69] When a trade was not achieved prior to the start of the regular season, Butler opted to play for Minnesota in 2018–19.[68] He appeared in 10 of the Timberwolves' first 13 games

He cites Paris Saint Germain as his favorite team and Neymar as his favorite player.[154] [155] Butler and his girlfriend have two children.[156] He did not make his Heat debut until the fourth game of the 2019–20 NBA season, as he was on paternity leave after the birth of his first child.[157] In the NBA Bubble, Butler opened Big Face Coffee, a side business which he operated out of his hotel room using his French press coffee brewer, charging $20 per cup.[158] A year later, he officially launched his coffee brand, and planned to dedicate his time into the coffee roastery business post-retirement.[159] During the 2023 NBA playoffs, Butler filed a trademark on the name \"Himmy Butler\" for the purpose of launching his own clothing and beverage brand. The nickname \"Himmy\" came from the meme phrase \"he's him\", which rose in popularity during the Heat's Butler-led run during that postseason.[160][161] Butler is a Christian.[162] Butler is featured in the Netflix documentary series, \"Starting 5\", which followed Butler, Anthony Edwards, LeBron James, Domantas Sabonis, and Jayson Tatum through the 2023–24 NBA season and playoffs.[163] Butler's father died on February 8, 2024.[164]",

                "content": "Editions: En/basketball/nba/miami-heat The former Boston Celtics legend keeps getting Miami Heat fans riled up. All good things must come to an end. That much is true in any walk of life, but it's especially true in sports. Nothing lasts forever, and that includes relationships between players and teams. The most recent example is currently unfolding, with the Miami Heat and Jimmy Butler going through a disastrous end to his tenure. On Friday, after several concerning Butler quotes, the Heat decided to suspend him and look for a trade partner. This isn't the first time Butler has essentially forced his way out of a prominent franchise. Butler was traded three times in back-to-back-to-back years, ultimately landing him in Miami in 2019. Butler's time in Miami has lasted quite a while, but he's not getting any younger and wants a ring before he retires. Still, the Heat made the NBA Finals twice with Butler, so who saw him calling it quits midway through this season? Paul Pierce did. The former Boston Celtics star, who shared NBA courts with Butler for a few seasons, took to social media to remind fans of a \"hot take\" he delivered a month ago. He mentioned back in early December on the Dan Le Batard Show that Butler wouldn't finish the year in Miami. Things were relatively quiet back when Pierce said that, so he clearly had a good inside source who knew there was trouble brewing. At the time, it didn't sit right with Heat fans due to Pierce's history with the Celtics and their rivalry with Miami. But Pierce can confidently say he was right, and he will be trusting his sources more than usual from now on. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved. Follow us",

                "content": "Alfred Jesse Smith (July 26, 1941 – January 3, 2025), known professionally as Brenton Wood, was an American singer and songwriter known for his three 1967 hit singles, \"The Oogum Boogum Song\" (peaking at No. 34 on the US Billboard Hot 100), \"Gimme Little Sign\" (peaking at No. 9), and \"Baby You Got It\" (also peaking at No. 34). Wood was born in Shreveport, Louisiana, United States on July 26, 1941.[1][2] The family moved to San Pedro in Los Angeles, California, when Wood was a child. He attended San Pedro High School for part of his first year before moving to Compton, where Brenton became a member of the Compton High School track team and received several awards for his athletic achievements. Following his high school graduation, Wood enrolled in East Los Angeles College. Soon after, he took the stage name Brenton Wood, possibly inspired by the wealthy Los Angeles enclave of Brentwood.[1] During this period, his musical interests began to manifest themselves. He was inspired by Jesse Belvin and Sam Cooke, and he began cultivating his songwriting skills, also becoming a competent pianist.[2] Early singles for Brent Records and Wand Records failed to chart. Wood signed with Double Shot Records, and his novelty song \"The Oogum Boogum Song\"[1] reached No. 19 on the US Billboard R&B chart and No. 34 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the spring of 1967. In Southern California, \"The Oogum Boogum Song\" hit the top 10 on KGB-FM and No. 1 on KHJ. Wood's biggest hit came a few months later, as \"Gimme Little Sign\" hit No. 9 on the pop chart,[1] No. 19 on the R&B charts, No. 2 on KHJ, and No. 8 in the UK Singles Chart;[3] sold over one million copies; and was awarded a gold disc.[2] The title is not actually sung in the song; the chorus instead repeats \"Give Me Some Kind of Sign\". Wood's \"Baby You Got It\" (1967)[1] peaked at No. 34 on the Hot 100 during the last week of 1967 and No. 3 on KHJ on January 31, 1968. His backing band during the 1960s was the LA-based Kent and The Candidates, which was led by drummer Kent Sprague.[4][5] They also recorded several singles for the Double Shot label.[6][7] A true music entrepreneur, in 1972 Wood formed his own record label and released, co-produced and co-wrote the Funk Soul classic \"Sticky Boom Boom [Too Cold] Part I and II\" with collaborators George Semper (co-producer, arranger) and Al McKay (co-writer, performer) of Earth, Wind & Fire fame.[8] Wood recorded a duet with Shirley Goodman.[1] Wood recorded the single, \"Rainin' Love (You Gotta Feel It)\" which was released on Midget M-101 in 1975. Along with \"Bump Me Baby\" by Dooley Silverspoon, \"The Mighty Clouds of Joy\" by Mighty Clouds of Joy, \"Come on Down (Get Your Head Out of the Clouds)\" by Greg Perry etc., it was a Newcomer Pick. With a positive review by the magazine, at the time it was predicted that it would cause quite a stir.[9] His next solo song to reach the charts was \"Come Softly to Me\" in 1977.[1] Wood returned again in 1986 with the album Out of the Woodwork,[10] which included contemporary re-recordings of his early hits, along with several new tracks, including the single, \"Soothe Me.\"[11] His album This Love Is for Real came out in 2001. Among his later appearances was in 2006 on the Los Angeles public access program Thee Mr. Duran Show, where Wood and his band performed several of his hit singles.[12] In 2014, he partnered with William Pilgrim & The All Grows Up for a remake of the song \"Gimme Little Sign\" on their album, Epic Endings.[13] In 2019, \"The Oogum Boogum Song\" was used in a commercial for Kinder Joy products. In 2024, Brenton Wood announced his farewell tour Catch You On The Rebound: The Last Tour. Wood was hospitalized in May 2024, pausing his farewell tour. Brenton Wood died at his home in Moreno Valley, California, on January 3, 2025, at the age of 83.[14]",

                "content": "In 1967, Brenton Wood looked as if he was on the cusp of mainstream success. The Compton crooner’s single “The Oogum Boogum Song” became a hit and ranked 34th and 19th on the Billboard’s Hot 100 and Top Selling R&B Singles charts, respectively. A few months later, Wood debuted his second hit, “Gimme Little Sign,” which peaked at No. 9 on Billboard’s Hot 100. Wood, who was born Alfred Jesse Smith, died Friday of natural causes at his home in Moreno Valley, his manager and assistant Manny Gallegos confirmed to Variety. He was 83. Wood’s slinky and upbeat tunes are infectious. His seductive and affable manner of describing the essence of a budding romance in layman’s terms is inviting. Whether solo or with a partner, it’s easy to groove to the beat. Music Pop music: The ‘Little Sign’-’Oogum Boogum’ hit-maker, in Santa Ana tonight, would love a crowd but enjoys an audience. Wood continued releasing tracks but none ever garnered similar success. Frustrated with the music industry, he quit for a couple of years, then inched back onto the club circuit. There, he found an audience that would sustain him for decades: Latinos. He would play major California cities, then travel through Mexico and into Arizona before returning home. As his audience aged, Wood began to perform on themed cruises and at festivals with Chicano musical luminaries including Los Lobos, Thee Midniters and Ozomatli. Wood’s romantic oldies resonated with a new generation of lovebirds, becoming a soundtrack of Southern California life — literally, as Wood found a third career as a performer at weddings, quinceañeras and anniversary parties. Bob Merlis, a former executive for Warner Bros. Records and co-author of “Heart & Soul: A Celebration of Black Music Style in America 1930-1975,” described the artist as a “local hero” to L.A. — a “standard bearer for the Southern California pop soul scene.” “Nothing else sounded like them,” said Merlis, who now runs a public relations and consulting firm. “It was so different and that instrumentation is very unusual.” Music Brenton Wood says of local Latinos, ‘They’ve kind of picked me out of the whole batch.’ The R&B singer headlines Greek’s ‘Latino Rock ‘n’ Soul’ show Sunday. “They’ve kind of picked me out of the whole batch, and they keep me going,” Wood told The Times in 1992. “I appreciate it, because if I was waiting for the big boys to call, I’d have died a long time ago.” Wood’s lyrics captured the cat-and-mouse chase of a first love, the kind of infatuation that makes people act a fool. He encapsulated that all-too-familiar yearning to whisk away a lover to bask in their honeymoon paradise. But he also wrote about heartache — and the triumphant moment when the pain wears off. “Latinos like to dedicate songs, and his songs are good for that,” radio veteran Art Laboe told The Times in 1992. “It’s not the big hits they like. It’s songs like ‘Take a Chance,’ ‘I Think You’ve Got Your Fools Mixed Up’ — if a girl’s having trouble with her boyfriend, she’ll dedicate that to him.” The songwriter was born July 26, 1941, in Shreveport, La., and moved west to San Pedro when he was 3. He moved throughout L.A.’s inner cities, selling papers and fish and shining shoes until he created a career in the music industry. Music Wayne Osmond, the fourth oldest of the nine Osmond children and brother to famed musical duo Donny and Marie Osmond, died Wednesday, his daughter said. He was 73. Wood was 7 when a pianist mesmerized him. Without a television set at home, he spent hours at the park, watching and mimicking the performer, using two fingers to tap on imaginary keys until he got his own piano. At 10, Brenton Wood wrote his first song about a man who wanted to be a bird. It was cheerful and rhymed but lacked oomph. He found his groove when he met his first girlfriend. Then, the words flowed out. The Compton High School graduate enrolled at East Los Angeles College and sang in local R&B groups such as Little Freddie and the Rockets and the Quotations in the 1950s before he went solo. He took on his stage name, Brenton Wood, from the wealthy L.A. enclave of Brentwood, where a manager lived. Wood’s “The Oogum Boogum Song” came entirely by accident. He was working the graveyard shift at Harvey Aluminum in Torrance when the melody came to him. Music Dulce, a vocalist who became one of Mexico’s best-known female voices in pop music in the 1980s, has died. She was 69. “It took me about six weeks, because I had to switch the verses around about a hundred times,” he told the San Diego Union-Tribune in 2000. “That was a song about fashion changes in the ’60s with bell-bottom hip-huggers and high-heeled boots and all the different styles of clothes the girls were wearing — hot pants and all that stuff.” The bouncy track was later featured in Cameron Crowe’s “Almost Famous” and Olivia Wilde’s “Don’t Worry Darling.” “It was one of the best feelings you could have,” Wood told Cal State Fullerton’s Titan TV in 2014. By 1970, he founded Mr. Wood Records and produced other artists’ singles. Latino listeners were already embracing him as one of their own. Music Richard Perry, who produced Carly Simon’s ‘You’re So Vain,’ Rod Stewart’s ‘Great American Songbook’ and Barbra Streisand’s genre switch, dies at 82. Chicano music historian Gene Aguilera recalls being “glued up” to his little transistor radio as a teen, listening to Wood’s “Gimmie Little Sign” mixed in with the Beatles and the Supremes on KRLA-AM 1110 all within an hour. Walking his neighborhood, he would hear Wood’s voice along with Thee Midniters wafting in the background, emanating from nearby parties or from lowriders cruising down Whittier Boulevard, bumping his tunes. “Even though he wasn’t born here, he’s just forever going to be etched in our consciousness,” said Aguilera, who last saw the artist perform at a local park in Baldwin Park before the pandemic. “His music was really accepted by East L.A. because of the slow groove he’s got, very soulful, that people from East L.A. just love.” Vega is a former Times staff writer.

                "content": "The Los Angeles Lakers are an American professional basketball team based in Los Angeles. The Lakers compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference. The Lakers play their home games at Crypto.com Arena, an arena they share with the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women's National Basketball Association and the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League.[10] The Lakers are one of the most successful teams in the history of the NBA with 17 championships, the second most in the league behind the Boston Celtics.[11] The franchise began in 1946 as the Detroit Gems of the National Basketball League (NBL).[12] After one season, a new ownership relocated the team to Minneapolis, Minnesota,[13][12] and renamed the team as the Minneapolis Lakers.[14] The Lakers won the 1948 NBL championship before joining the rival Basketball Association of America, where they won the 1949 BAA championship. Following the merger of the NBL and the BAA into the NBA in 1949, the Lakers won four of the next five NBA championships.[15] After struggling financially in the late 1950s, they relocated to Los Angeles before the 1960–61 season. The Lakers made the NBA Finals six times in the 1960s, but lost every series to the Celtics, beginning their long and storied rivalry. In 1968, the Lakers acquired four-time NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) Wilt Chamberlain, and won their sixth NBA title in 1972, led by coach Bill Sharman. After the retirement of Chamberlain, the team traded for superstar Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Two big changes came in 1979, first, Jerry Buss purchased the Lakers, and pioneered a vision of basketball as entertainment as well as sport.[16] Second, the Lakers drafted Magic Johnson first overall in the 1979 NBA draft. The combination of Johnson, a prodigy point guard, and dominant center in Abdul-Jabbar provided the Lakers with superstars to anchor their roster. The promotion of head coach Pat Riley in 1981 and addition of forward James Worthy through the 1982 draft established the Lakers as an NBA powerhouse throughout the 1980s. The franchise won five championships in a nine-year span, including two out of three marquee Finals matchups against the Celtics. The Lakers were defeated by their Boston archrivals in the 1984 Finals, but triumphed over them in 1985 and 1987. After Riley departed and Abdul-Jabbar, Johnson, and Worthy retired, the Lakers struggled in the early 1990s. It was not until 1996 when the team traded with the Charlotte Hornets for the draft rights to Kobe Bryant and signed center Shaquille O'Neal that the Lakers returned to dominance during the early 2000s. The superstar duo, along with Hall of Fame coach Phil Jackson, led the Lakers to three consecutive championships between 2000 and 2002, securing the franchise's second \"three-peat\".[17] The dynamic \"Shaq-and-Kobe\" era ended when the Lakers traded away O'Neal after the team lost to the Detroit Pistons in the 2004 Finals. It was not until the Lakers traded for Pau Gasol that Bryant and Jackson returned to the NBA Finals, losing to the Celtics in 2008 but winning championships in 2009 and 2010. The 2010 Finals marked the latest matchup of the Lakers and Celtics, with Los Angeles winning its 16th title. Jackson retired in 2011, and the Lakers endured their longest playoff drought in franchise history. Gasol departed in 2014, and Bryant retired in 2016. After rebuilding seasons with young, highly rated prospects, the Lakers signed superstar LeBron James in 2018.[18] In 2019, the team traded several of those prospects for star big man Anthony Davis.[19] The Lakers—led by James, Davis, and coach Frank Vogel—won the team's 17th championship in 2020, tying the Celtics for the most titles until 2024.[20] The Lakers hold the record for NBA's longest winning streak, 33 straight games, set in 1971–72.[21] 26 Hall of Famers have played for Los Angeles, while four have coached the team. Abdul-Jabbar, Johnson, O'Neal, and Bryant won a combined eight NBA MVP awards with the Lakers.[22] The franchise was founded in 1946 as the Detroit Gems and played in the National Basketball League (NBL) during the 1946–47 season where it finished last in the league with only 4 wins in 44 games. Though the team was scheduled to continue in the NBL the following season,[23] its ownership, faced with high losses due to low attendance and lack of homecourt, decided on selling the team to Ben Berger and Morris Chalfen of Minnesota for $15,000[13][24] Minneapolis sportswriter Sid Hartman played a key behind-the-scenes role in helping put together the deal and later the team.[25] Inspired by Minnesota's nickname, \"Land of 10,000 Lakes\", the team rechristened themselves the Lakers.[26][27] Hartman helped them hire John Kundla from College of St. Thomas, to be their first head coach, by meeting with him and selling him on the team.[28][29] As the franchise had the worst record in the NBL the previous season, it got the first pick in the 1947 Professional Basketball League of America dispersal draft, which they used to select George Mikan. Led by Mikan, the Lakers had a solid roster, which also featured forward Jim Pollard and playmaker Herm Schaefer.[30] In their first season, they led the league with a 43–17 record, later winning the NBL championship that season.[31] In 1948, the Lakers moved from the NBL to the Basketball Association of America (BAA), and Mikan's 28.3 point per game (ppg) scoring average set a BAA record. In the 1949 BAA Finals they won the championship, beating the Washington Capitols four games to two.[32] Following the season, the BAA and the NBL merged to form the National Basketball Association (NBA).[33] In the newly formed league, the Lakers improved to 51–17 record and won their third straight professional championship.[34] In the 1950–51 season, Mikan won his third straight scoring title at 28.4 ppg and the Lakers went 44–24 to win their second straight division title.[35] One of those games, a 19–18 loss against the Fort Wayne Pistons, became infamous as the lowest scoring game in NBA history.[36] In the playoffs, they defeated the Indianapolis Olympians in three games but lost to the Rochester Royals in the next round.[30] During the 1951–52 season, the Lakers won 40 games, finishing second in their division.[37] They faced the New York Knicks in the NBA Finals, which they won in seven games.[38] In the 1952–53 season, Mikan led the NBA in rebounding, averaging 14.4 rebounds per game (rpg), and was named MVP of the 1953 NBA All-Star Game.[35] After a 48–22 regular season, the Lakers defeated the Fort Wayne Pistons in the Western playoffs to advance to the NBA Finals.[38] They then defeated the New York Knicks to win their second straight championship.[39] Though Lakers star George Mikan suffered from knee problems throughout the 1953–54 season, he was still able to average 18 ppg.[40] Clyde Lovellette, who was drafted in 1952, helped the team win the Western Division.[40] The team won its third straight championship in the 1950s and sixth in seven seasons when it defeated the Syracuse Nationals in seven games.[39] Following Mikan's retirement in the 1954 off-season, the Lakers struggled but still managed to win 40 games. Although they defeated the Rochester Royals in the first round of the playoffs, they were defeated by the Fort Wayne Pistons in the semifinals.[41] Although they had losing records the next two seasons, they made the playoffs each year.[37] Mikan came back for the last half of the 1955–56 season, but struggled and retired for good after the season.[42] Led by Lovellette's 20.6 points and 13.5 rebounds, they advanced to the Conference Finals in 1956–57. The Lakers had one of the worst seasons in team history in 1957–58 when they won a league-low 19 games.[43] They had hired Mikan, who had been the team's general manager for the previous two seasons, as head coach to replace Kundla. Mikan was fired in January when the team was 9–30, and Kundla was rehired.[37][44] The Lakers earned the top pick in the 1958 NBA draft and used it to select Elgin Baylor. Baylor, who was named NBA Rookie of the Year and co-MVP of the 1959 NBA All-Star Game, averaged 24.9 ppg and 15.0 rpg helping the Lakers improve to second in their division despite a 33–39 record.[45] After upsetting the Hawks in six games in the division finals, they returned to the NBA Finals, but were swept by the Celtics, beginning their long rivalry.[46] In their last year in Minneapolis, the Lakers went 25–50. On January 18, 1960, the team was coming off a loss and traveling to St. Louis when their plane crash-landed.[49] Snow storms had driven the pilot 150 miles off course when he was forced to land in a cornfield. No one was hurt.[50] Their record earned them the number two pick in the 1960 NBA draft. The team selected Jerry West from West Virginia University.[51] During the 1960 off-season, the Lakers became the NBA's first West Coast team when owner Bob Short decided to move the team to Los Angeles.[52] Led by Baylor's 34.8 ppg and 19.8 rpg, Los Angeles won 11 more than the year before in West's first season.[53] On November 15 that season, Baylor set a new NBA scoring record when he scored 71 points in a victory against the New York Knicks while grabbing 25 rebounds.[54] In doing so, Baylor broke his own NBA record of 64 points. Despite a losing record, the Lakers made the playoffs.[37] They came within two points of the NBA Finals when they lost in game seven of their second round series against St. Louis.[55] Led by Baylor and West at 38.3 and 30.8 ppg respectively,[56] the Lakers improved to 54–26 in 1961–62, and made the finals. In a game five victory, Baylor grabbed 22 rebounds and set the still-standing NBA record for points in a finals game with 61,[57] despite fouling out of the game.[58] The Lakers, however, lost to the Celtics by three points in overtime of game seven.[56] Frank Selvy, after making two jumpers in the final 40 seconds to tie the game,[59][60] missed a potential game-winning 18 foot jump shot in regulation, a miss which he said in June 2010 still haunted him more than 40 years later.[60] Los Angeles won 53 games in 1962–63, behind Baylor's 34.0 ppg and West's 27.1 ppg[61] but lost in the NBA Finals in six games to the Celtics.[61] After falling to 42–38 and losing in the first round of the 1964 NBA playoffs to the Hawks, the team won 49 games in 1964–65. The Lakers surged past the Baltimore Bullets in the division finals, behind West's record-setting 46.3 ppg in the series.[62] They lost again to the Celtics in the Finals however, this time in five games.[63] Los Angeles lost in the finals to Boston in seven games again in 1966, this time by two points.[64] Down by 16 entering the fourth quarter, and 10 with a minute and a half to go, the Lakers mounted a furious rally in the closing moments, which fell just short.[65] After dropping to 36 wins and losing in the first round of the 1967 NBA playoffs, they lost in the finals to the Celtics again in 1968.[37] Los Angeles moved to a brand-new arena, The Forum, in 1967, after playing seven seasons at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena. On July 9, 1968, the team acquired Wilt Chamberlain from the Philadelphia 76ers for Darrell Imhoff, Archie Clark, and Jerry Chambers.[67] In his first season as a Laker, Chamberlain set a team record by averaging a league-leading 21.1 rpg.[68] West, Baylor, and Chamberlain each averaged over 20 points, and Los Angeles won their division.[69] The Lakers and Celtics again met in the finals, and Los Angeles had home court advantage against Boston for the first time in their rivalry. They won the first game behind Jerry West's 53 points,[70] and had a 3–2 lead after five.[71] Boston won the series in seven games however,[72] and earned their 11th NBA Championship in 13 seasons.[73] West was named the first-ever Finals MVP; this remains the only time that a member of the losing team has won the award.[74] In 1970, West won his first scoring title at 31.2 ppg, the team returned to the finals, and for the first time in 16 years, they did not have to face the Celtics; instead playing the New York Knicks, who defeated them 4–3.[75][76] The next season the Lakers were defeated by the Milwaukee Bucks, led by future Laker Lew Alcindor (now known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) in the Western Conference Finals.[77] The 1971–72 season brought several changes. Owner Jack Kent Cooke brought in Bill Sharman as head coach,[78] and Elgin Baylor announced his retirement early in the season after realizing that his legs were not healthy enough.[78] Sharman increased the team's discipline.[79] He introduced the concept of the shootaround, where players would arrive at the arena early in the morning before a game to practice shots.[80] They won 14 straight games in November and all 16 games played in December.[78] They won three straight to open the year of 1972 but on January 9, the Milwaukee Bucks ended their winning streak by defeating the Lakers, 120–104.[81] By winning 33 straight games, Los Angeles set a record for longest winning streak of any team in major American professional team sports.[82][83] The Lakers won 69 games that season, which stood as the NBA record for 24 years until the Chicago Bulls won 72 games in 1995–96.[84] Chamberlain averaged a low 14.8 points but led the league in rebounding at 19.2 a game.[85] West's 9.7 assists per game (apg) led the league, he also averaged more than 25 points, and was named MVP of the 1972 NBA All-Star Game.[85] The team failed to score 100 points just once all year,[86] and at the end of the season, Bill Sharman was named Coach of the Year.[87] The Lakers went on to reach the finals against the New York Knicks where they would avenge their 1970 finals loss by defeating them 4 games to 1. Chamberlain tallied 24 points and 29 rebounds in game five and won the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award.[88][89] The Lakers won 60 games in the 1972–73 season, and took another Pacific Division title.[90] Wilt Chamberlain, playing in his final season, again led the league in rebounding and set the NBA record for field-goal percentage at 72.7% which stood for several decades.[90] The team defeated the Chicago Bulls in seven games in the conference semifinals, then the Golden State Warriors in five in the Western Division Finals.[90] They played the New York Knicks in the 1973 NBA Finals. Los Angeles took the first game by three points, but New York won the series in five games.[91] During the 1973–74 season, the team was hampered by the loss of West, who played only 31 games before his legs gave out.[92] Goodrich, averaging 25.3 points, helped the team to a late-season surge.[92] Trailing the Golden State Warriors by three games with seven left to play, the Lakers rallied to finish 47–35 and win the Pacific Division.[92] They made the playoffs but managed just one win against Milwaukee in the conference semifinals. Following the season, West retired due to contract disagreements with Cooke, and filed a suit for unpaid back wages.[93] After missing the playoffs in the 1974–75 season, the Lakers acquired Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who had won three league MVPs by that time.[94] Abdul-Jabbar wanted out of Milwaukee, demanding a trade to either New York or Los Angeles.[95] He was traded for Elmore Smith, Brian Winters, Junior Bridgeman, and Dave Meyers. Abdul-Jabbar had his fourth MVP season in 1975–76, leading the league in rebounding, blocked shots, and minutes played.[96] The Lakers struggled in January, going 3–10, and finished out of the playoffs at 40–42.[96] West and Cooke settled their differences—and the former Laker's lawsuit—and Cooke hired him to replace Sharman as the team's coach.[97] West became upset, however, when Cooke refused to spend the money necessary to acquire forward Julius Erving, who the Nets were selling.[98] Behind another MVP season from Abdul-Jabbar, Los Angeles won the Pacific Division, finishing the 1976–77 season a league-best 53–29.[99] They defeated the Warriors in a seven-game series to open the postseason before being swept by Portland in the Western Conference Finals.[96] During the off-season, Los Angeles picked up Jamaal Wilkes from Golden State and signed first-round draft pick Norm Nixon. In the first two minutes of the first game of the 1977–78 season, Abdul-Jabbar punched Bucks center Kent Benson for an overly aggressive elbow and broke his hand.[100] Two months later, a healthy Abdul-Jabbar got into an altercation with Houston Rockets center Kevin Kunnert after a rebound. The team's starting power forward, Kermit Washington, who was averaging 11.5 points and 11.2 rebounds,[101] entered the fight, and when Rudy Tomjanovich ran in from the bench to break up the action, Washington punched him in the face.[102] Tomjanovich nearly died from the punch, suffering a fractured skull and other facial injuries, which prematurely ended his playing career.[103] Washington, who stated that he assumed Tomjanovich was a combatant, was suspended for two months by the NBA, and released by the Lakers.[104] The team won 45 games despite being down a starter in Washington and not having Abdul-Jabbar for nearly two months, but lost in the first round of the playoffs to Seattle.[105] During the 1978–79 season, the team posted a 47–35 record but lost to the SuperSonics in the semifinal round of the playoffs.[96] In the 1979 NBA draft, Los Angeles selected 6-foot, 9-inch point guard Magic Johnson from Michigan State with the first overall pick.[106] It took Johnson's teammates time to acclimate themselves to his passing ability, as his \"no-look\" passes often caught them unaware. Once they adjusted, his passing became a key part of Los Angeles' offense.[107] The Lakers won 60 games in Johnson's rookie year, and defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in six games in the 1980 NBA Finals. Johnson won the Finals MVP award, after starting at center for the injured Abdul-Jabbar in game six, and tallying 42 points, 15 rebounds, and seven assists.[108] The team fell off in the 1980–81 season, though, as the Lakers lost Johnson for most of the season to a knee injury.[109] The team turned in a 54–28 record and finished second behind the Phoenix Suns in the Pacific Division.[109] The Rockets, led by Moses Malone, defeated Los Angeles in the first round of the playoffs.[109] Early in the 1981–82 season, Johnson complained to the media about head coach Paul Westhead and demanded a trade.[110] Westhead was fired shortly after Johnson's criticisms, and although Lakers' owner Jerry Buss stated that Johnson's comments did not factor into the decision, Johnson was vilified by the national media and booed both on the road and at home.[111][112][113] Buss promoted assistant coach Pat Riley to \"co-head coach\" with Jerry West (although West considered himself Riley's assistant) on November 19 and the team won 17 of its next 20 games.[109][114][115] Nicknamed \"Showtime\" due to the team's new Johnson-led fast break-offense, the Lakers won the Pacific Division title and swept both the Suns and Spurs in the 1982 playoffs.[116] Los Angeles stretched its postseason winning streak to nine games by taking the first contest of the NBA Finals from the 76ers.[109][117] The team won the Finals 4–2 to finish a 12–2 playoff run.[109] On draft night in 1982, the Lakers had the first overall pick (the result of a trade with Cleveland midway through the 1979–80 season, when the Lakers had sent Don Ford and a 1980 first-round pick to the Cavaliers for Butch Lee and their 1982 selection) and selected James Worthy from North Carolina.[118] The Lakers won the Pacific Division at 58–24, but Worthy suffered a leg injury in the last week of the season and missed the rest of the season.[119] Nevertheless, they advanced to play Philadelphia in the 1983 NBA Finals after defeating Portland and San Antonio.[119] The Sixers, however, won the series and the championship in four games.[118] After the season West replaced Sharman as the team's GM.[120] In the 1983–84 season, Los Angeles went 54–28, and played Boston in the Finals for the first time since 1969.[121] The Lakers won two of the first three games. However, Kevin McHale's hard clothesline foul of Lakers forward Kurt Rambis on a fast break is credited as a turning point of the series.[122] Boston won three of the next four to win the title and send Los Angeles's record to 0–8 in Finals series against the Celtics.[121] Using the past year's Finals defeat as motivation, the team won the Pacific Division for the fourth straight year and lost just two games in the Western Conference playoffs. In the NBA Finals, the Celtics were again the Lakers' final hurdle. Los Angeles lost game one of the NBA Finals by a score of 148–114, in what is remembered as the \"Memorial Day Massacre\".[123] The Lakers, behind 38-year-old Finals MVP Abdul-Jabbar, recovered to defeat the Celtics in six games.[124] The team won the title in the Boston Garden and became the first visiting team to ever win an NBA championship in Boston, as the Golden State Warriors later achieved this feat in 2022.[123] In the 1985–86 season, the Lakers started 24–3 and went on to win 62 games and their fifth straight division title.[126] The Rockets, however, defeated the Lakers in five games in the Western Conference Finals. Houston won the series when Ralph Sampson hit a 20-foot jumper as time expired in game five at The Forum.[126] Prior to the 1986–87 season, the Lakers moved A.C. Green into the starting lineup, and acquired Mychal Thompson from the Spurs.[127] Johnson won his first career MVP Award while leading the Lakers to a 65–17 record,[127] and Michael Cooper was named NBA Defensive Player of the Year.[127] Before the season, Riley had made the decision to shift the focus of the offense to Johnson over the 40-year-old Abdul-Jabbar.[128] The Lakers advanced to the NBA Finals by sweeping the Nuggets, defeating the Warriors in five games, and sweeping the SuperSonics in the Western Conference Finals.[129] The Lakers defeated Boston in the first two games of the Finals, and the teams split the next four games, giving Los Angeles their second championship in three seasons.[127] The series was highlighted by Johnson's running \"baby hook\" shot to win game four at Boston Garden with two seconds remaining.[130] Johnson was named the NBA Finals MVP, in addition to regular season MVP.[131] At the Lakers' championship celebration in Los Angeles, coach Riley brashly declared that Los Angeles would repeat as NBA champions,[127] which no team had done since the 1968–69 Boston Celtics. Looking to make good on Riley's promise in the 1987–88 season, the Lakers took their seventh consecutive Pacific Division title with a 62–20 record. They swept the Spurs in the first round of the Western Conference Finals before pulling out a tough seven-game series win over the Utah Jazz led by youngsters Karl Malone and John Stockton. A seven-game Western Conference finals win over the Dallas Mavericks propelled the Lakers to the NBA Finals once again. In their seventh trip to the Finals in nine years, they met the Detroit Pistons. Los Angeles would take the series in seven games, and James Worthy's game seven triple-double earned him a Finals MVP award.[132] The win marked their fifth title in nine years, but would also mark their last title until 2000. In the 1988–89 season, Los Angeles won 57 games and their eighth consecutive Pacific Division crown. They swept through the playoffs defeating Portland, Seattle, and Phoenix. In an eighth trip to the NBA Finals in 10 years, they once again faced the Detroit Pistons.[133] Hampered by injuries to Byron Scott and Johnson, the Lakers were swept by Detroit.[134] Following the 1989 Finals, on June 28, 1989, after 20 professional seasons, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar announced his retirement. The Lakers still cruised through the Pacific Division, winning their ninth consecutive division crown with a 63–19 record. However, after beating the Rockets in the first round, they lost four games to one in the second round of the playoffs to the Suns.[135] Riley announced he was stepping down after the season citing burnout,[136] and was replaced by Mike Dunleavy.[137] Riley's departure received a mixed reaction from the players. They respected his contributions, but some, such as Worthy and Scott, had grown tired of his intense practices and felt he tried to take too much credit for the team's successes.[138] Following the season, 1987 Defensive Player of the Year winner Michael Cooper decided to play in Europe and was waived at his request.[139] The 1990–91 Lakers failed to win the Pacific Division for the first time in 10 years, but still finished with a 58–24 record. After cruising through the Western Conference playoffs, the Lakers found themselves in the NBA Finals once again, their ninth trip to the Finals in 12 years. The 1991 Finals represented a changing of the guard as the Lakers were defeated in five games by the Chicago Bulls, led by superstar Michael Jordan.[140] On November 7, 1991, Magic Johnson announced he had tested positive for HIV and would retire immediately.[141] In their first season without Johnson, the team won 43 games to earn the eighth seed in the Western Conference playoffs.[37] The Lakers were defeated in the first round by Portland. Following the season, head coach Mike Dunleavy was fired. The Lakers would lose 43 games in 1992–93 under Randy Pfund, their first losing season since 1976. The Lakers would still make the playoffs, and would become the first eighth seed to win the opening two games on the road against a number one seed when they took a 2–0 lead against Phoenix.[142] They lost the next two games at home however, then game five in Phoenix in overtime.[142] During the 1993–94 season, Pfund was fired during the season that would result in the Lakers failing to make the playoffs for the first time since 1976. Magic Johnson, would coach the final 16 games of the season with former teammate Michael Cooper as his lead assistant.[143] Johnson decided not to take the job permanently due to what he felt was a lack of commitment from certain players, and Los Angeles ended the season with a 10-game losing streak to finish 33–49.[144][145] Under new coach Del Harris, Los Angeles made the playoffs each of the next two seasons but was eliminated in the second and first rounds respectively.[146][147] The team was led by young guards Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones.[148] Johnson came out of retirement to return as a player in the 1995–96 season to lead the then 24–18 Lakers to a 29–11 finish.[149] After some run-ins with Van Exel, displeasure with Harris's strategies, and a first-round loss to the Rockets, Johnson decided to retire for the final time after the season.[150] During the 1996 off-season, the Lakers acquired 17-year-old Kobe Bryant from the Charlotte Hornets for Vlade Divac; Bryant was drafted 13th overall out of Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, Pennsylvania in that year's draft, by Charlotte. Los Angeles also signed free-agent Shaquille O'Neal.[151] Trading for Bryant was West's idea, and he was influential in the team's signing of the all-star center.[152] \"Jerry West is the reason I came to the Lakers\", O'Neal later said.[153] They used their 24th pick in the draft to select Derek Fisher.[154] During the season, the team traded Cedric Ceballos to Phoenix for Robert Horry.[155] O'Neal led the team to a 56–26 record, their best effort since 1990–91, despite missing 31 games due to a knee injury.[156] O'Neal averaged 26.2 ppg and 12.5 rpg and finished third in the league in blocked shots (2.88 bpg) in 51 games.[156][157] The Lakers defeated the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round of the playoffs as O'Neal scored 46 points in Game 1 against the Trail Blazers, marking the highest single-game playoff scoring output by a Laker since Jerry West scored 53 against the Celtics in 1969.[156] In the next round, the Lakers lost in five games to the Utah Jazz.[156] In the 1997–98 season, O'Neal and the Lakers had the best start in franchise history, 11–0.[158] O'Neal would miss 20 games on the season due to an abdominal injury.[158] Los Angeles battled Seattle for the Pacific Division title most of the season. In the final two months, the Lakers won 22 of their final 25 games,[158] finishing 61–21, but still finished second to Seattle in the standings.[158] The Lakers defeated Portland three games to one in the first round to advance to face Seattle. Although the Sonics won the first game, the Lakers responded with four straight wins, taking the series,[158] but were swept by the Jazz in the Western Conference Finals.[158] During the 1998–99 season, All-Star guard Eddie Jones and center Elden Campbell were traded to the Charlotte Hornets.[159] The team also acquired J. R. Reid, B. J. Armstrong, and Glen Rice.[160] Head coach Del Harris was fired in February after a three-game losing streak and replaced on an interim basis by former Laker Kurt Rambis.[161] The team finished 31–19 in the strike-shortened season, which was fourth in the Western Conference.[162] The Lakers defeated Houston in the first round of the playoffs, but were swept by San Antonio in the next round. Game four of the series would be the last game ever played at the Great Western Forum.[163] Before the 1999–2000 season, West was prepared to hire Rambis as the team's full-time coach before an outcry from fans and members of the organization caused him to seek out a bigger name.[164] Los Angeles hired former Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson, who had coached that team to six championships, and gave him a lucrative $6 million a year contract.[165] He brought along assistant Tex Winter and they installed Winter's version of the triangle offense.[166] The Lakers signed veterans Brian Shaw, John Salley, Ron Harper, and A.C. Green, who was a Laker during the \"Showtime\" era.[155] The team also moved to a new arena, the Staples Center.[167] Led by league MVP O'Neal, the Lakers won 31 of their first 36 games.[168] They finished 67–15, the highest win total since they won 65 in the 1986–87 season.[168] Then eliminated Sacramento and Phoenix in the first two rounds of the playoffs.[169] After the Lakers took a three games to one lead in the Western Conference Finals against Portland, the Trail Blazers won the next two games to force a game seven.[170] The Lakers, who trailed by 15 points in the fourth quarter, would go on 19–4 run to tie the game and eventually win 89–84 to advance to the NBA Finals.[170] In their first trip to the Finals since 1991, the Lakers defeated Reggie Miller and the Indiana Pacers four games to two win their first title since 1988.[171] West retired from his spot in the team's front office after the season after a power struggle between him and Jackson over control of the team's operations.[172] After the season, starters Rice and Green left the team,[173] and Los Angeles signed Horace Grant.[174] The following season, the Lakers won 11 fewer regular season games than the prior year,[175] but swept the first three rounds of the playoffs, defeating the Portland, Sacramento, and San Antonio.[176] They met Allen Iverson and the Philadelphia 76ers in the NBA Finals. Although the Sixers took game one in overtime,[177] the Lakers won the next four games to win their second straight title. Their 15–1 postseason record was the best in NBA history.[178] The Lakers won 58 games in 2001–02. In the playoffs, they swept Portland and defeated San Antonio four games to one to advance to the Western Conference Finals to face Sacramento.[181] The series would go on to be known as one of the greatest playoff matchups in NBA history. The series extended to all seven games and ended in a Lakers victory.[182] In game one, Bryant scored 30 points as the Lakers won, 106–99. The series would then shift in Sacramento's favor, with the Kings winning the next two games. Facing a deficit in game 4, the Lakers had the ball with under 20 seconds to play. After misses by both Bryant and O'Neal, Kings center Vlade Divac tapped the ball away from the rim in an attempt to wind down the clock. It went straight into Robert Horry's hands, who drained a game-winning three with under three seconds to play. After the Kings won game five on a buzzer-beater by Mike Bibby, the Lakers were faced with a must-win game six. In one of the most controversial playoff games in league history (Tim Donaghy's betting scandal), the Lakers would win by four points.[183] The Lakers went on to win game seven in overtime, with the Kings missing numerous potentially game-saving shots and free throws. The Lakers then achieved a three-peat by sweeping Jason Kidd and the New Jersey Nets in the NBA Finals.[184] O'Neal won each of the Finals series' MVP awards, making him the only player besides Michael Jordan to win three consecutive Finals MVPs.[185] The Lakers would attempt a four-peat the following year, but started the 2002–03 season 11–19.[186] However, they finished the season 39–13 to finish 50–32.[187] They defeated Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs, but the four-peat attempt ended as they were eliminated by San Antonio in six games in the second round.[188] During the 2003–04 season, the team was the subject of intense media coverage generated by the teaming of four stars and the sexual-assault case involving Kobe Bryant.[189][190] Before the season, the Lakers signed two-time MVP Karl Malone formerly of the Jazz, and former Seattle Defensive Player of the Year Gary Payton to join O'Neal and Bryant,[191] forming the first \"superteam\" of the 21st century.[192][193] Three of the \"big four\", however, struggled with injuries: O'Neal suffered from a strained calf, Malone an injured knee, and Bryant an injured shoulder.[194][195] The Lakers started 18–3 and finished 56–26 and won the Pacific Division title, entering the playoffs as the No. 2 seed. They defeated Houston, San Antonio, and Minnesota to advance to the NBA Finals.[196] In the Finals, they would lose to Detroit in five games. During the 2004 off-season, the team entered a rebuilding phase when O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat for Lamar Odom, Brian Grant, Caron Butler, and a first-round draft pick.[197] Bryant and O'Neal had clashed in the past,[198] and the media credited their feud as one of the motivating factors for the trade.[199] Jackson did not return as head coach, and wrote a book about the team's 2003–04 season, in which he heavily criticized Bryant and called him \"uncoachable\".[200][201][202] The Lakers front office said that the book contained \"several inaccuracies\".[203] The Lakers also traded Rick Fox and Gary Payton to Boston, for Chris Mihm, Marcus Banks, and Chucky Atkins before the 2004–05 season.[204] Derek Fisher, frustrated with losing playing time, opted out of his contract and signed with the Warriors.[204] The team hired Rudy Tomjanovich to replace Jackson.[204] After sitting out the first half of the 2004–05 season, Malone announced his retirement on February 13, 2005.[205] Tomjanovich coached the team to a 22–19 record before resigning due to health problems.[206] Assistant Frank Hamblen was named interim head coach to replace Tomjanovich for the remainder of the season.[207] Bryant (ankle) and Odom (shoulder) suffered injuries, and the Lakers finished 34–48, missing the playoffs for only the fifth time in franchise history and the first time since 1994.[37] With the tenth overall pick in the 2005 NBA draft, the Lakers selected Andrew Bynum, a center from St. Joseph High School in Metuchen, New Jersey.[208] The team also traded Caron Butler and Chucky Atkins to Washington for Kwame Brown and Laron Profit.[209] Jackson returned to coach the team after Rudy Tomjanovich resigned midway through the previous season.[210] On January 22, 2006, Bryant scored 81 points against Toronto, the second-highest total in NBA history.[211] Ending the season 45–37, the team made the playoffs after a one-season absence.[212] After taking a three games to one lead in the first round, Phoenix came back to take the series in seven games.[213] In the following season, the Lakers won 26 of their first 39 games,[214] but lost 27 of their last 43—including seven in a row at one point—to finish 42–40.[214] They were eliminated in the first round by Phoenix again.[214] Frustrated by the team's inability to advance in the playoffs, Bryant demanded to be traded in the off-season.[215] Buss initially agreed to seek a trade,[216] but also worked to try to change Bryant's mind.[217] After re-acquiring Derek Fisher, the Lakers started the 2007–08 season with a 25–11 record, before Andrew Bynum, their center who was leading the league in field-goal percentage, went out for the year due to a knee injury in mid-January.[218] In what would become a crucial transfer for the franchise's return to championship form, they acquired the six-time all-star power forward Pau Gasol from the Memphis Grizzlies in a trade in early February and went 22–5 to finish the season.[219] The Lakers' 57–25 record earned them the first seed in the Western Conference.[220] Bryant was awarded the league's MVP award, becoming the first Laker to win the award since O'Neal in 2000.[221][222] In the playoffs, they defeated the Nuggets in four games, the Jazz in six, and the defending champion Spurs in five, but lost to the Celtics in six games in the NBA Finals.[223] In the 2008–09 season, the Lakers finished 65–17; the best record in the Western Conference.[224] They defeated the Jazz in five games, the Rockets in seven and the Nuggets in six, to win the Western Conference title. They then won their 15th NBA championship by defeating the Orlando Magic in five games in the NBA finals.[225] Bryant was named the NBA Finals MVP for the first time in his career.[226] The Lakers, who had added Ron Artest (Metta World Peace)[227] in place of Trevor Ariza in their starting lineup, finished the 2009–10 season with the best record in the Western Conference for the third straight time. On January 13, 2010, the Lakers became the first team in NBA history to win 3,000 regular-season games by defeating the Dallas Mavericks 100–95.[228] They defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Utah Jazz, and the Phoenix Suns in the Western Conference playoffs. In the finals, the Lakers played the Boston Celtics for the 12th time. They rallied back from a 3–2 disadvantage in the series and erased a 13-point deficit in the fourth quarter of the seventh game to defeat the Celtics. This series win gave them their 16th NBA title overall and 11th since they moved to Los Angeles.[229] Bryant was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row, despite a 6–24 shooting performance in game seven.[230] After much speculation, head coach Phil Jackson returned for the 2010–11 season.[231] In the playoffs, the Lakers defeated the New Orleans Hornets in the first round.[232] But their opportunity for a three-peat was denied by the Dallas Mavericks in a four-game sweep of the second round. After the season, it was announced that Jackson will not be returning to coach the Lakers.[233] After Jackson's retirement, former Cleveland Cavaliers head coach Mike Brown was hired as head coach on May 25, 2011.[234] Before the start of the shortened 2011–12 season, the Lakers traded Lamar Odom to the Dallas Mavericks after Odom requested to be traded.[235] On the trade deadline long time Laker Derek Fisher along with a first round draft pick were traded to the Houston Rockets for Jordan Hill.[236] With a 41–25 regular season record the Lakers entered the playoffs as the third seed, the team defeated the Denver Nuggets in the first round in seven games but were eliminated by the Oklahoma City Thunder in the second round in five games.[237][238] On July 4, 2012, Steve Nash of the Phoenix Suns agreed to a sign-and-trade deal that would send him to the Lakers in exchange for the Lakers' 2013 and 2015 first round draft picks, 2013 and 2014 second round draft picks, and $3 million. The trade was made official on July 11, 2012, the first day the trade moratorium was lifted.[239] On August 10, 2012, in a four-team trade the Lakers traded Andrew Bynum and acquired Dwight Howard.[240] The combination of these players with Bryant and Gasol led media outlets to refer to them as a \"superteam\" comparable to the 2003-04 Lakers.[241][242] On November 9, 2012, Mike Brown was relieved of coaching duties after a 1–4 start to the 2012–13 season.[243] Assistant Coach Bernie Bickerstaff took over as interim head coach, leading the Lakers to a 5–5 record. On November 12, 2012, the Lakers hired Mike D'Antoni as head coach.[244] On February 18, 2013, Lakers owner Jerry Buss died from cancer at age 80.[245] On the court, D'Antoni coached the Lakers to a 40–32 record the rest of the way to finish 45–37, their worst record since 2007. The Lakers clinched a playoff berth on the final game of the season and finished seventh in the Western Conference after beating the Houston Rockets on April 16, 2013.[246][247] The Lakers battled injuries all season, the most prominent of which is the Achilles tendon rupture to Kobe Bryant that ended his season after 78 games. The absence of Bryant was sorely felt as the Lakers were swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the 2013 NBA playoffs.[248] Nevertheless, Bryant passed Lakers legend Wilt Chamberlain to become the fourth all-time leading scorer in NBA history on March 30, 2013, against the Sacramento Kings.[249] On December 8, 2013, Bryant played in his first game since tearing his Achilles tendon on April 12, 2013.[250] However, on December 17, 2013, he suffered a broken bone in his knee, and did not return for the remainder of the season.[251][252] On March 25, 2014, the Lakers scored 51 points in the third quarter against the New York Knicks, the most points scored in a quarter in the history of the franchise.[253] The Lakers went on to miss the NBA playoffs for the first time since 2005, for just the second time in the last two decades and for just the sixth time in franchise history. On April 30, 2014, Mike D'Antoni resigned from his position as head coach after a 27–55 season.[254] After spending the majority of the off-season without a head coach, the Lakers named former player Byron Scott as the new head coach.[255] After the season, he was the frontrunner to become the new Lakers head coach. Scott interviewed three times for the position, which had become vacant after Mike D'Antoni's resignation.[256] On July 28, 2014, he signed a multi-year contract to coach the Lakers.[257] During the first game of the 2014–15 season, the seventh overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft, Julius Randle went down with a broken leg, which ended his rookie season. The Lakers began their season losing 10 of their first 16 games. After playing only 35 games, Kobe Bryant tore a rotator cuff in his shoulder ending his season. Nick Young was also forced to end his season with a fractured kneecap, leaving the team with a record of 14–41.[258] With 27 games left in the regular season, Byron Scott gave rookie Jordan Clarkson more playing time. Clarkson, the 46th overall pick in the 2014 draft, finished his rookie season with game stats of 11.9 ppg, 3.2 rpg, 3.5 apg, and shooting 44.8% from the field.[259] The Lakers' season ended with a record of 21–61, the fourth worst record in the league and at the time the worst record in franchise history. The next season, the Lakers had the second overall pick of the 2015 NBA draft, which they used to select Ohio State freshman point guard D'Angelo Russell. The team also selected Larry Nance Jr. with the 27th overall pick.[260] On November 30, 2015, Bryant announced he would retire at the end of the season after 20 seasons with the team.[261] In Bryant's last season the team missed the playoffs for the third straight year with a 17–65 record, the worst in franchise history.[262] On April 24, 2016, the Lakers announced that they would not exercise their option on Byron Scott's contract for the following season.[263] On April 29, the team announced another former Laker, Luke Walton, as their new head coach. At the time of his hiring, Walton was an assistant coach for the Golden State Warriors, who were in the playoffs, so he could not officially begin his duties as head coach until the Warriors' playoff run was over.[264] The Lakers earned the second overall pick in the 2016 NBA draft,[265] and selected Brandon Ingram from Duke University.[266] The team also selected Ivica Zubac with the 32nd overall pick.[267] On February 21, 2017, the Lakers fired general manager Mitch Kupchak, while Magic Johnson was named as the president of basketball operations. The team's governor Jeanie Buss, also announced the removal of her brother, Jim Buss, from his position as executive vice president of basketball operations.[268][269] On March 7, 2017, the Lakers hired Rob Pelinka as the general manager, signing him to a five-year deal.[270] The Lakers again earned the second overall pick, this time, in the 2017 NBA draft,[271] and selected Lonzo Ball from UCLA.[272] The Lakers also acquired Kyle Kuzma from the University of Utah with the 27th overall pick from a draft-day trade, along with Brook Lopez in exchange for D'Angelo Russell and Timofey Mozgov.[273] The Lakers also traded their 28th overall pick, Tony Bradley, in exchange for the 30th overall pick, Josh Hart, from Villanova University and the 42nd overall pick, Thomas Bryant, from Indiana University.[274] In February 2018, Nance Jr. and Clarkson were traded away to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Isaiah Thomas, Channing Frye, and a 2018 first-round draft pick.[275] On July 2, 2018, Randle was renounced by the Lakers.[276] On July 9, 2018, the Lakers signed LeBron James to a four-year, $154 million contract.[277][278] By the Christmas Day game, the Lakers were six games over .500 before James sustained a groin injury leading to several weeks of missed games. Ball and Ingram also ended their seasons early due to injuries. On February 7, 2019, Zubac was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers along with Michael Beasley in exchange for Mike Muscala.[279] On April 9, 2019, Johnson stepped down as the team's president of basketball operations,[280] and two days later, the Lakers parted ways with head coach Walton after the team failed to reach the playoffs for the sixth straight year.[281] On May 13, Frank Vogel was named the Lakers' head coach.[282] The Lakers received the fourth overall pick in the 2019 NBA draft lottery.[283] On July 6, the Lakers acquired Anthony Davis from the New Orleans Pelicans for Ball, Ingram, Hart, and three first-round picks, including the number four overall in the 2019 draft.[284] This trade officially ended the young core era of the Lakers; only Kuzma remained out of the group of players. Following the suspension of the 2019–20 NBA season, the Lakers were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final eight games of the regular season.[285] The Lakers finished the regular season with a 52–19 record, entering the playoffs for the first time since 2013,[286] and as the top seed for the first time since 2010.[287] They advanced to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2010.[288] They defeated the Miami Heat 4–2 to win the 2020 NBA Finals,[289] and James was named the Finals MVP for the fourth time in his career.[290] The win gave Los Angeles their 17th championship in franchise history, tying the Boston Celtics for the most all-time.[291] Primary Lakers owner Jeanie Buss, who took over the team in 2017, would also become the first female controlling owner of an NBA team to win the NBA Finals.[292] During the 2021 off-season, the Lakers picked up many NBA veterans, the most notable of which was Russell Westbrook, who was acquired in a blockbuster trade with the Washington Wizards. Kyle Kuzma, the last player left from the Lakers' young core era, was traded away, along with others. Other veterans picked up during the off-season included Carmelo Anthony, DeAndre Jordan, and returning players Wayne Ellington, Trevor Ariza, Dwight Howard and Rajon Rondo.[293] Alex Caruso left the Lakers and signed with the Chicago Bulls, and veteran locker-room voice Jared Dudley retired.[294][295] The Lakers made a surprising run in the 2023 Playoffs, making the Western Conference Finals, but were defeated by the eventual champion Denver Nuggets. On December 9, 2023, the Lakers won the inaugural NBA In-Season Tournament after defeating the Indiana Pacers in the championship game. James was named the inaugural tournament MVP.[296] They finished the 2023–24 season 47–35 and beat the New Orleans Pelicans in the Play-In to make the playoffs as the seventh seed. On June 27, 2024, the Lakers selected Bronny James, the son of LeBron, at 55th overall in the 2024 NBA draft, forming the first father-son duo in NBA history.[297] JJ Redick was hired as head coach of the Lakers.[298] On October 23, 2024, the team made NBA history as being the first one to have father and son (LeBron James & Bronny James) play together as they beat Minnesota Timberwolves on their season opening game.[299] The rivalry between the Boston Celtics and the Lakers involves the two most storied basketball franchises in National Basketball Association (NBA) history. It has been called the best rivalry in the NBA.[300] The two teams have met a record 12 times in the NBA Finals, starting with their first Finals meeting in 1959. They would go on to dominate the league in the 1960s and the 1980s, facing each other six times in the 1960s and three times in the 1980s. The rivalry had been less intense since the retirements of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird in the early 1990s, but in 2008 it was renewed as the Celtics and Lakers met in the Finals for the first time since 1987, with the Celtics winning the series 4–2. They faced off once again in the 2010 NBA Finals, which the Lakers won in 7 games. The two teams were tied for the highest number of championships, with 17 titles apiece, until the Celtics surpassed this record in the 2024 NBA Finals; together, the 35 championships account for almost half of the 78 championships in NBA history. The all-time series record for the Lakers vs Celtics is 209–165 with the Celtics being the forerunners. Boston is the only NBA team with an overall winning record against the Lakers.[301] The rivalry between the Lakers and the Detroit Pistons developed in the late 1980s.[302]: 228 Both teams faced each other in back-to-back finals appearances in the 1988 NBA Finals, which the Lakers won in 7 games and the 1989 NBA Finals, which the Pistons won in 4 games. The rivalry reemerged in the early 2000s as both teams squared off against one another in the 2004 NBA Finals, which the Pistons won in five games. The Lakers have a lengthy history with the Golden State Warriors as both franchises relocated to California during the early 1960s. Geography does play a minor role in the rivalry; however there exists more respect between both teams and fans alike, unlike the Dodgers–Giants rivalry of MLB, or the 49ers–Rams rivalry of the NFL in which both teams express fierce animosity against one another.[303][304] The rivalry began to sprout during the 1970s as the two teams would meet six times in the postseason from 1967 to 1991. Both teams fluctuated in success at varying times, however; the Lakers recent rise following the signing of LeBron James contributed heavily to adding a level of competition between both sides as James had previously faced the Warriors in four straight finals as a member of the Cavaliers. Both teams have met seven times in the postseason, combining for 38 division titles since both teams relocated to California in the early 1960s.[305][306] The Lakers lead the all time regular season series 262–173, and the postseason series 25–11.[307][308] The rivalry between the Lakers and the Los Angeles Clippers is unique because they were the only two NBA teams to share an arena, the Crypto.com Arena. It is also one of only two intra-city rivalries in the NBA, the other being the new crosstown rivalry between the New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets. Los Angeles fans have historically favored the Lakers.[309][310] Some contend that the term rivalry was inaccurate until the Clippers became more successful.[311] The Lakers and the Phoenix Suns rivalry didn't develop until the 2000s where the teams were led by Kobe Bryant and Steve Nash, respectively. The San Antonio Spurs and the Lakers, developed what some would classify as a rivalry in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Since 1999, the teams have met in the NBA Playoffs five times, with the clubs combining to appear in seven consecutive NBA Finals (from 1999 to 2005). Additionally, the teams combined to win five NBA championships from 1999 to 2003; the Spurs won the NBA championship in 1999, 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2014 while the Lakers won the championship in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2009 and 2010. From 1999 to 2004 the clubs' rivalry was often considered the premier rivalry in the NBA,[312] and each time the clubs faced each other in the playoffs the winner advanced to the NBA Finals. In 2008, the teams met again in the Western Conference Finals where the Spurs were handily defeated only to beat the Lakers when they met again in 2013. The Kings and the Lakers have faced each other in the playoffs nine times between 1949 and 2002, and since the Kings moved to Sacramento in 1985, both have been based in California. The 2002 Western Conference Finals was one of the most bitterly contested in NBA history, with many controversial calls in game 6.[313] The Lakers would win the series in game 7. Berger and Chalfen purchased the NBL's disbanded Detroit Gems for $15,000 in 1947, changed their name to the Lakers, and relocated them to Minnesota. Max Winter bought a third of the club in their early years and sold his share to Mikan in 1954. Berger bought Mikan's share in 1956 giving him a controlling (⅔) interest.[314] After Mikan retired, attendance plummeted and the team lost money for several seasons, leading the ownership group to put the team up for sale in 1957.[315] Marty Marion, a retired baseball player and manager, and his business partner Milton Fischman attempted to purchase the team with the intention of moving the club to Kansas City, Missouri.[315][316] Mikan offered to mortgage his home in an attempt to buy the team and keep the club in Minnesota.[317] The Lakers were sold to a group of investors led by Bob Short, however.[314] The team was sold to Short's group with the agreement that it would not be relocated to Kansas City but kept in Minnesota.[318] Short's ownership group consisted of 117 Minnesota businesses and private citizens, who amassed a total of $200,000 for the purchase; $150,000 to buy the team and $50,000 to run it.[314] By 1958 Short had become 80% owner of the team by buying out his partners,[314] but the team was floundering. Attendance remained poor, and the NBA had put the Lakers on \"financial probation\", notifying them that if they did not meet certain ticket sales numbers they could be bought out by the league and relocated. Short was forced to move the team to Los Angeles in 1960; the club had lost $60,000 in the first half of the 1959–60 season alone.[319] The NBA's owners originally voted 7–1 against the move.[320] When Short indicated that he might take the team to a new rival league that was developing, however, the owners held another vote that same day and allowed the relocation (8–0).[321] Aided by Baylor's drawing power,[322][323] and the new locale, the team's finances improved when they arrived in LA.[324][325] Short sold the team to Washington Redskins owner and publisher Jack Kent Cooke in 1965 for a then league record amount of $5.175 million.[326] Short insisted the deal be conducted in cash as he was wary of Cooke, so guards transported the money in a cart from one New York bank to another.[327] Cooke was a more hands-on owner than Short, and overhauled the team's operations.[328] He personally financed construction of the Forum in 1967 at a cost of $16.5 million.[329][330] He owned the team until 1979 when he sold it, the NHL's Los Angeles Kings, the Forum, and some real estate to Jerry Buss for $67 million.[331] Cooke was forced to sell the team as he was undergoing a costly divorce.[332][333] Buss was a local chemical engineer and former University of Southern California professor who had become wealthy in real estate.[330][334] Philip Anschutz bought a stake in the team in 1998,[335] and until October 2010 Magic Johnson was a minority owner as well.[336] Buss started the trend of allowing sponsors to add their name to team's stadiums when he renamed the Forum the Great Western Forum in 1988.[337] In 2009 major sponsors included Verizon Wireless, Toyota, Anheuser-Busch, American Express, and Carl's Jr., and the team's $113 average ticket price was the highest in the league.[335] In 2013, Buss died at the age of 80 after being hospitalized for 18 months with cancer.[338][339][340] His controlling ownership of the team passed to his six children via a trust, with each child receiving an equal vote.[341][342] Buss' succession plan had daughter Jeanie Buss assume his title as the Lakers' governor as well as its team representative at NBA Board of Governors meetings.[342][343] Given the team's proximity to Hollywood, the Lakers fanbase includes numerous celebrities, many of whom can be seen at the Staples Center during home games.[344] Jack Nicholson, for example, has held season tickets since the 1970s, and directors reportedly need to work their shooting schedules around Lakers home games.[345] From 2002 and 2007 the team averaged just over 18,900 fans, which placed them in the top ten in the NBA in attendance. Red Hot Chili Peppers' song \"Magic Johnson\", from their 1989 album Mother's Milk, is a tribute to the former point guard, and frontman Anthony Kiedis and bassist Michael \"Flea\" Balzary are frequently seen attending home games.[346] In 2008, the team sold out every home game,[347] and in 2010, the Lakers had the most popular team merchandise among all NBA teams, and Bryant the most popular jersey.[348] The Laker nickname came from the state of Minnesota being the Land of 10,000 Lakes.[14][349] The team's colors are purple, gold and white.[350][6][351] The Lakers logo consists of the team name, \"Los Angeles Lakers\" written in purple on top of a gold basketball. The team usually wears white jerseys for Sunday and holiday home games.[350][352] List of the last five seasons completed by the Lakers. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Los Angeles Lakers seasons. The Lakers have won 17 NBA titles and have appeared in the NBA Finals 15 other times.[37] These appearances include eight NBA Finals appearances in the 1980s. The best record posted by the team was 69–13, in 1972; the worst record was 17–65, in 2016.[37] Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W–L% = Winning percentage Bryant holds most individual team records for longevity including most games played (1,333), and most minutes logged (48,298). Johnson holds all significant assist records for the club including career assists (10,141), assists in a game (24), and highest assist average for a season (13.1). Johnson also has the most triple doubles, with his 138 over 100 more than the next closest player (Bryant; 17). Elmore Smith holds team records for blocks in a game (17), blocks per game for a season (4.85), and career blocks per game (3.93). The scoring records are mostly shared by Elgin Baylor and Bryant, with Baylor having the highest average for a career (27.4) while Bryant has the highest points scored in a single game (81). Baylor, Bryant and West hold the top five single-season scoring averages, with Bryant occupying the first (35.4) and fourth (31.6) spots, while Baylor has the second (34.8), and third (34.0), and West the fifth (31.3).[353][354] The Lakers hold several NBA records as a team including most consecutive games won overall (33) and most consecutive road games won (16), both of which came during the 1971–72 season,[355] highest field-goal percentage for a season at 54.5% (1984–85),[356] and highest road winning percentage at 0.816 (1971–72).[66] They also hold records for having (into the 2009–10 season) the most wins (3,027), the highest winning percentage (61.9%), and the most NBA Finals appearances (31).[37][357] The 2000–01 team set the NBA record for best playoff record at 15–1, which was later broken by the Golden State Warriors in 2017.[358] The 1971–72 team holds franchise records in wins (69), most points scored, and largest margin of victory; both of the latter came in the team's 63 point win versus Golden State (162–99).[359] They also held the record for most wins at home in the regular season (going 36–5 in 1971–72, then 37–4 in both 1976–77 and 1979–80) unil the Boston Celtics set the current record of 40–1 in the 1985–86 season. The Lakers play their home games at Crypto.com Arena, located at L.A. Live in downtown Los Angeles. The arena opened in fall 1999 and seats up to 18,997 for Lakers games.[360] Owned and operated by AEG and L.A. Arena Company, the arena is also home to the Los Angeles Clippers, the WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks, and the NHL's Los Angeles Kings.[360] Before moving to Staples Center, for 32 seasons (1967–1999), the Lakers played their home games at The Forum in Inglewood, California, located approximately 10 miles southwest of the team's current home.[167] During the 1999 preseason, the Lakers played their home games at the Forum before officially moving into Crypto.com Arena, and once again hosted a preseason game versus the Golden State Warriors on October 9, 2009, this time to commemorate the team's 50th-anniversary season in Los Angeles.[361] In the first seven years in Los Angeles, the team played their home games at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, south of downtown Los Angeles.[362] While the team played in Minneapolis, the team played their home games at the Minneapolis Auditorium and the Minneapolis Armory from 1947 to 1960.[363] Roster Last transaction: December 29, 2024 The Lakers hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA.[364] A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.[365] This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. The Lakers have had three first overall picks in their history: Elgin Baylor (selected in 1958), Magic Johnson (selected in 1979) and James Worthy (selected in 1982).[368] The Lakers have also had six lottery picks in their history: Eddie Jones (selected tenth overall in 1994), Andrew Bynum (selected tenth overall in 2005), Julius Randle (selected seventh overall in 2014), D'Angelo Russell (selected second overall in 2015), Brandon Ingram (selected second overall in 2016) and Lonzo Ball (selected second overall in 2017).[368] Other draft picks include Jerry West and Gail Goodrich in the 1960s, Michael Cooper and Norm Nixon in the 1970s, A.C. Green and Vlade Divac in the 1980s, Elden Campbell, Nick Van Exel, Derek Fisher and Devean George in the 1990s, and Luke Walton, Sasha Vujačić, and Ronny Turiaf in the 2000s.[368] There have been 29 head coaches for the Lakers franchise. John Kundla coached the team in Minneapolis when they won their first five BAA/NBA championships from 1949 to 1954.[52] Pat Riley is second in franchise history in both regular season and playoff games coached and wins.[369] Phil Jackson broke Riley's regular-season wins record in 2009, and he passed Riley's playoff wins and games coached records in 2010.[369] Jackson, Riley, Kundla, and Bill Sharman have all been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame for their coaching careers. George Mikan, Jim Pollard, Jerry West, Pat Riley, Magic Johnson, Kurt Rambis, Byron Scott and Luke Walton have all played and head-coached for the Lakers. Jackson, who had two stints as head coach, was coach from 2005 to 2011. In May 2011, Mike Brown was named his replacement for the 2011–12 season.[370] Brown was fired[371] on November 9, 2012, after a 1–4 start. Assistant coach Bernie Bickerstaff served as interim head coach for five games before the Lakers selected Mike D'Antoni as their new head coach. D'Antoni resigned at the end of the 2013–14 season. In July 2014, Byron Scott was hired as head coach.[372] After the 2015–16 season ended, Scott was fired. On April 29, 2016, former Lakers player Luke Walton was named as Scott's replacement,[373] and served as head coach until the end of the 2018–19 season.[374] Frank Vogel was named his successor on a multiyear deal announced on May 13, 2019.[375] Vogel was fired following the conclusion of the 2021–22 season.[376] On June 6, 2022, Darvin Ham was named as Vogel's successor as head coach.[377] However, Ham was fired by the Lakers on May 3, 2024, after the Lakers were eliminated in Game 5 of the first round by the Denver Nuggets. Among his accomplishments was leading the Lakers to their first In-Season Tournament championship.[378] On June 24, 2024, former NBA player JJ Redick was hired as the 29th coach in team history.[379] The Lakers have 41 Hall of Famers (31 players, 5 head coaches, 1 assistant coach, and 4 contributors) who contributed to the organization.[380][381][382] Notes: The Lakers have retired thirteen jersey numbers and an honorary microphone in honor of their players and broadcaster:[392][393][394][395][396] On January 13, 2025, Michael Cooper will have his #21 jersey retired.[397] In addition, several other players and coaches who were instrumental to the franchise's success during its days in Minneapolis have a banner commemorating them as Hall of Fame members of the Minneapolis Lakers, although jersey numbers for these players are not retired by the franchise:[400] For 41 years, Chick Hearn was the team's broadcaster until his death in 2002. He broadcast 3,338 consecutive games between November 21, 1965, and December 16, 2001.[401] Hearn came up with West's \"Mr. Clutch\" nickname.[402] He was a part of the team's \"inner sanctum\" when Cooke was owner, and was consulted on basketball decisions.[403] Paul Sunderland, who had filled in for a couple of games while Hearn recuperated in the 2001–02 season, was named the permanent play-by-play announcer. Stu Lantz was retained as the color commentator.[404] When Sunderland's contract expired in the summer of 2005, the team chose not to renew it.[405] Then, Joel Meyers moved in alongside Lantz as the television announcer, with Spero Dedes and former Laker player Mychal Thompson on the radio.[406] For the 2011–12 season, Bill Macdonald became the new television play-by-play announcer, joining Lantz who remained as the color analyst. Meanwhile, John Ireland joined Mychal Thompson to call the games on radio.[407] Beginning in the 2009–10 season, Lakers radio broadcasts were heard on KSPN (Los Angeles ESPN Radio affiliate) in English and KWKW in Spanish.[406][408] KLAC had the team's radio broadcast rights from the 1976–77 season until the 2008–09 season.[408][409] Until 2011, telecasts had been split between KCAL-TV (road games) and Fox Sports West (home games), unless they are chosen for national broadcasts on ABC.[410] KCAL had been the Lakers' over-the-air television broadcaster since 1977, dating back to when the station was the RKO General-owned KHJ-TV, the longest relationship between an NBA team and a television station. Prior to KHJ, Laker games were televised on KTLA. The Lakers had been on Fox Sports West since 1985, dating to when it was the original Prime Ticket and owned by Buss.[411] On February 14, 2011, Time Warner Cable and the Lakers announced the formation of two new regional sports networks (one in English, one in Spanish) that would exclusively televise the team's games and related programming for 20 years starting with the 2012–13 season.[412] The said networks were originally known as Time Warner Cable SportsNet, before it was renamed Spectrum SportsNet in 2016 upon Charter Communications' purchase of Time Warner Cable.[413]",

Policy Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a virus that usually causes symptoms similar to the common cold. It often causes upper respiratory infections, but it can sometimes cause lower respiratory infections like pneumonia, asthma flare-ups or make chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) worse. HMPV infections are more common in the winter and early spring. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Most people get HMPV before they turn 5. You can get HMPV again, but symptoms are usually mild after your first infection. Human metapneumovirus most often causes symptoms similar to a cold, but some people can get very sick. You’re more likely to get severely sick the first time you get HMPV, which is why young kids have a greater risk for serious illness. You get some protection (immunity) from your first infection and then are more likely to have mild, cold-like symptoms if you get another HMPV infection. Adults over 65 and people with breathing problems or a weakened immune system may also get severe symptoms. Researchers estimate that about 10% to 12% of respiratory illnesses in children are caused by HMPV. Most cases are mild, but about 5% to 16% of children will develop a lower respiratory tract infection like pneumonia. It’s not the same, but human metapneumovirus is similar to RSV (respiratory syncytial virus). It’s part of the same genus — or scientific grouping — as RSV (Pneumovirus), and can cause similar symptoms. The peak age for severe illness from HMPV is between 6 and 12 months, but RSV is more likely to cause severe illness in infants younger than 6 months. Symptoms of human metapneumovirus include: Advertisement A virus — a small germ that uses your cells to make more copies of itself — causes HMPV. It’s part of the same group of viruses that cause RSV, measles and mumps. HMPV spreads through direct contact with someone who has it or from touching things contaminated with the virus. For instance: Anyone can get HMPV, but you’re at a higher risk for severe illness if you: Sometimes HMPV causes complications. These might be serious and require you to be hospitalized. They include: Healthcare providers usually diagnose HMPV based on your symptoms and health history. They might use a soft-tipped stick (swab) to get a sample from your nose or throat. A lab tests the sample for viruses and other infections. Keep in mind that you probably won’t be tested for HMPV unless you have serious symptoms. Sometimes, your provider may also do a bronchoscopy or chest X-rays to look for changes in the airways of your lungs. There aren’t any antiviral medications that treat human metapneumovirus. Most people can manage their symptoms at home until they feel better. If you or your child are severely ill, you might need to be admitted to the hospital. There, healthcare providers can monitor your condition and help prevent you from getting sicker. They might treat you with: No. Antibiotics only treat bacteria. Since HMPV is a virus, antibiotics won’t get rid of it. Sometimes people who get pneumonia from HMPV also get a bacterial infection at the same time (secondary infection). If your provider prescribes antibiotics, it would be to treat any secondary infections. You can reduce your risk of getting HMPV and other infectious diseases by: Advertisement Mild cases of human metapneumovirus usually last a few days to a week. If you’re very sick, it’ll probably take longer to feel better. You might also have lingering symptoms, like a cough, that take longer to go away. You can manage mild, cold-like symptoms of HMPV at home by: Contact a healthcare provider if: Go to the ER or seek immediate medical attention if you or your child has symptoms of severe illness, including: It might be helpful to ask your healthcare provider: Advertisement A note from Cleveland Clinic Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a common virus that usually causes symptoms similar to a cold. If you’re older than 5, you’ve probably already had it at least once. Most of the time, you’ll get better at home in a few days. But sometimes HMPV can cause serious complications. Young children, adults over 65 and people with weakened immune systems are at a higher risk for severe illness. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have any concerns about HMPV.

It is a seasonal disease that usually occurs in the winter and early spring, similar to RSV and the flu. Anyone can be infected with hMPV but it is most common in children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems. It spreads through close contact with an infected person and, in most cases, will go away on its own after a few days. People with hMPV usually have mild symptoms similar to a cold, but young children, older adults and those with a weakened immune system may develop a more severe illness. Most hMPV infections only last about 2-5 days and go away on their own. Treatment consists of supportive care to ease symptoms. Many times, patients with severe hMPV are very young, so they rely on a caregiver to talk to their doctor. Here are some questions to ask on their behalf.

Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) can cause upper and lower respiratory disease in people of all ages, especially among young children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems. Discovered in 2001, HMPV is in the Pneumoviridae family along with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Broader use of molecular diagnostic testing has increased identification and awareness of HMPV as an important cause of upper and lower respiratory infection. Symptoms commonly associated with HMPV include cough, fever, nasal congestion, and shortness of breath. Clinical symptoms of HMPV infection may progress to bronchitis or pneumonia and are similar to other viruses that cause upper and lower respiratory infections. The estimated incubation period is 3 to 6 days, and the median duration of illness can vary depending upon severity but is similar to other respiratory infections caused by viruses. HMPV is most likely spread from an infected person to others through In the U.S., HMPV circulates in distinct annual seasons. HMPV circulation begins in winter and lasts until or through spring. Surveillance data from CDC's the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) shows HMPV to be most active during late winter and spring in temperate climates. HMPV, RSV, and influenza can circulate simultaneously during the respiratory virus season. Your patients can help prevent the spread of HMPV and other respiratory viruses by following these steps: Patients who have cold-like symptoms should In addition, cleaning possible contaminated surfaces (such as doorknobs and shared toys) may potentially help stop the spread of HMPV. In healthcare settings, healthcare providers should follow CDC's 2007 Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings. Since HMPV is a recently recognized respiratory virus, healthcare professionals may not routinely consider or test for HMPV. However, healthcare professionals should consider HMPV testing during winter and spring, especially when HMPV is commonly circulating. Infection with HMPV can be confirmed usually by Currently, there is no specific antiviral therapy to treat HMPV and no vaccine to prevent HMPV. Medical care is supportive.

These may include: In more severe cases, patients may experience wheezing, difficulty breathing and asthma flare-ups. Secondary lower respiratory infections may occur such as bronchiolitis, bronchitis or pneumonia, requiring additional medical care. Most people experiencing mild hMPV symptoms do not need to see a doctor, as the illness should go away on its own and supportive care of symptoms at home is enough. However, if symptoms worsen and you develop shortness of breath, severe cough or wheezing, you should see a doctor. To diagnose a respiratory infection, your doctor will complete a physical and patient history. To further diagnose hMPV as the source of the respiratory infection, your doctor may order lab tests to confirm the type of virus causing your illness. In very few severe hospitalized cases, doctors may do a bronchoscopy where a small, flexible camera is inserted into the lung and a sample of fluid is removed to test for viruses.

                "title": "Virginia Tech Hokies football - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Virginia Tech Hokies football team represents Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in the sport of American football. The Hokies compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Coastal Division of the Atlantic Coast Conference. They previously competed in the Big East. Their home games are played at Lane Stadium, located in Blacksburg, Virginia, with a seating capacity of over 65,000 fans. Lane Stadium is considered to be one of the loudest stadiums in the country, being voted number two in ESPN's 2007 \"Top 20 Scariest Places to Play\".[2] It was also recognized in 2005 by Rivals.com as having the best home-field advantage in the country.[3] Since beginning football in 1892, the Hokies have won over 700 games and appeared in 33 bowl games, including the 2000 BCS National Championship game. The Hokies rank 23rd among all Division I college football teams for most wins. The program had a streak of 27 consecutive bowl appearances, starting with the 1993 Independence Bowl and lasting through the 2019 Belk Bowl.[4] This was fourth-longest streak of consecutive bowl game appearances in college football history.[5] The program has also claimed eleven conference titles (3 South Atlantic, 1 Southern, 3 Big East, and 4 ACC) and produced eight Consensus All-Americans.[6][7] Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College (now Virginia Tech) first played football on October 21, 1892, against St. Albans Lutheran Boys School (Radford, Virginia). The game took place on a plowed off wheat field that was \"about as level as a side of Brush Mountain\".[8] The Hokies won their first game 14–10, but were defeated 10–0 eight days later on a return trip to Radford.[9] The first several VAMC teams wore cadet gray and black, but in 1896 the colors were changed to Burnt Orange and Chicago Maroon – a color combination that was unique among educational institutions at the time. The 1899, 1901, and 1903 teams lost only to rival Virginia. Star player Hunter Carpenter returned to Virginia Tech in 1905, after a year at the University of North Carolina, for a last shot at beating Virginia. Carpenter helped lead VPI to a 9–1 record, the best in school's history up to that time. He was never named to the All-America team only because Walter Camp, who named the team at the time, said he would never name a player who he had not seen play. The 1909 team claim a southern championship. This is the first season the team was referred to in print as the \"Gobblers,” which became the official nickname in 1912.[10] At the end of the 1911 season, VPI joined the South Atlantic Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SAIAA). They won the conference in 1916 and 1918. After 1921, the SAIAA was dissolved and six of its schools became founding members of the Southern Conference. From 1925 to 1928, Tech was led by Frank Peake and the \"Pony Express\" backfield. He was joined by Scotty MacArthur, Herbert \"Mac\" McEver and Tommy Tomko.[11] In 1927, during a 6–0 upset of the Colgate Red Raiders in New York, Peake ran for nearly 200 yards and scored the game's only points. During one three-game stretch, he accumulated rushing and return yardage of 306, 314 and 353 yards. He was credited with gaining 1,761 yards in eight games. 930 were from scrimmage, and 831 on punts and kickoffs.[12] In 1928 the game against Virginia he came off the sideline with an injured hip to return a punt for a touchdown.[11] In 1932, Tech upset Georgia 7–6.[13] Bill Grinus blocked the tying extra point.[14] Virginia Tech's first post-season bowl appearance was in the 1947 Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas, against the University of Cincinnati.[15] Tech had a 3–3–3 record that year, and was the third choice after Border Conference champions Hardin–Simmons University and runner-up Texas Tech Red Raiders both declined the bowl invitation.[16] Tech lost that game 18–6. Another first for the Gobblers came in 1954 when they had their first, and only, unbeaten season in school history. The team was 8–0–1 and finished ranked 16th in the Associated Press post-season football poll.[17] The team's lone blemish was a 7–7 tie against William & Mary in Blacksburg, Virginia. Despite the team's success, it did not appear in a post-season bowl game. The 1963 team captured Tech's only outright SoCon championship.[13] In the 1970s, Tech briefly adopted an aggressive passing offense under head coach Charlie Coffey; quarterback Don Strock set virtually every passing record in the Hokies' book and would hold many for 30 years or more. Success, though, remained elusive. In the early 1980s, football coach and athletic director, Bill Dooley spearheaded a campaign for a new look and name for the mascot, which debuted at the 1981 football game against Wake Forest. The turkey-like figure was referred to as \"the Hokie mascot\", \"the Hokie\", and \"the Hokie bird\" (derived from the \"Old Hokie\" cheer), which resulted in changing the official designation of the Virginia Tech mascot to the Hokies. Dooley led the Hokies to the program's first-ever bowl win, in the 1986 Peach Bowl over NC State, but he also earned the program NCAA sanctions that led to his resignation that very offseason (after which he promptly sued the school). Though many hoped for recently departed Maryland coach Bobby Ross, athletic director Dutch Baughman turned to Frank Beamer, a Hokie alumnus and defensive back from 1966 to 1968. Beamer had worked his way up the assistant coaching ladder since his 1969 graduation before spending six seasons in the head job at Murray State. Among the assistants Beamer brought with him from the Racers was linebackers coach Bud Foster, who had joined Beamer's first Murray State staff as a graduate assistant immediately upon his own graduation there. Virginia Tech joined the Big East Conference for football play in 1991 (later joined for all sports in 2000). The Hokies were competitive in the new league early on, but could never beat annual foe, the Miami Hurricanes, despite eventually having a 6–6 record vs. the Hurricanes during the Big East years.[18] In 1993, the Hokies earned a trip to the Independence Bowl in Shreveport, Louisiana, its first bowl game under Beamer. With a win in that game, the Hokies notched only the fourth nine-win season in school history at the time. It became the first of 23 straight bowl games under Beamer, until he retired in 2015. After finally beating the Hurricanes during the 1995 regular season, the 13th ranked Hokies clinched a berth in the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, Louisiana–the program's first appearance in a major bowl game. They beat the 9th ranked Texas Longhorns 28–10. This was a signature win for the Hokies, capping the most successful season to date; it became turning point for the program as a whole. Virginia Tech's most successful football season was in 1999 under the guidance of redshirt freshman quarterback, Michael Vick. Among other amazing moments, on November 3, the Hokies came from behind on the road, to win against the West Virginia Mountaineers. Vick led a desperate last minute drive that culminated in a dramatic Shayne Graham game-winning field goal. The 22–20 victory has since become known as the \"Miracle in Morgantown.\"[19] The team completed the year with its first ever undefeated regular season, finishing with an (11–0) record. On January 4, 2000, the Hokies faced the Florida State Seminoles in the 2000 Sugar Bowl for the national championship. A back and forth game, the Hokies trailed 28–7 late in the second quarter but came back to take a 29–28 lead at the start of the fourth. However, they were not able to hold on and the Seminoles won 46–29. The Hokies finished third in the AP Poll and second in the Coaches Poll–in both cases, the highest final ranking in school history and the highest ever for a Division I team from the Commonwealth. The following season, in 2000, the Hokies were again contenders for the national championship, but a loss to No. 3 Miami in early November, in a game in which Michael Vick was limited because of an injury, cost them a trip to the Orange Bowl. The Hokies later went on to defeat the Clemson Tigers 41–20 in the 2001 Gator Bowl in Jacksonville, Florida. At the start of the 2004 season, the Hokies faced the No. 1 and eventual national champion USC Trojans in the BCA Classic played at FedExField in Landover, Maryland. The Hokies kept the game close, but eventually lost 24–13. The regular season ended with the Hokies winning the ACC championship in their first year in the conference and a return to the Sugar Bowl and a match-up with the Auburn Tigers. Auburn, the SEC champion and one of three undefeated teams (USC and Oklahoma being the other two), took a 16–0 lead into the fourth quarter. Led by senior quarterback Bryan Randall, the Hokies scored 13 points but fell just short of the comeback when the Tigers recovered an onside kick and ran out the clock. The 2005 season saw many ups and downs, but would end in disappointment. Taking over for Bryan Randall was Marcus Vick, younger brother of Hokies great Michael Vick. The Hokies started off the season 8–0, including victories over West Virginia and ACC rivals Georgia Tech and Boston College. Going into the tenth week of the season, the Hokies were ranked 3rd in the country behind USC and Texas and would face the 5th ranked Miami Hurricanes at home. In anticipation of the match-up, ESPN's College Gameday would broadcast the game nationally from Blacksburg on ESPN. The Hurricanes controlled the game and limited Marcus Vick to only 90 yards passing to win 27–7. Marcus Vick led the Hokies and went on to win the ACC Coastal Division title, but lost in the ACC Championship Game to Florida State. The Hokies again trailed the Seminoles by double digits at halftime, 27–3, but a Vick led comeback brought the score to 27–22 with 1:45 left in the fourth quarter. The Hokies were unable to recover the onside kick and lost their chance at a BCS Bowl berth. The Hokies closed the season against the upstart Louisville Cardinals in the 2006 Gator Bowl. Virginia Tech won 35–24, but the game would become infamous for a play that would contribute to Vick's expulsion from the team. Late in the first half, with the Hokies trailing 17–10, Vick was tackled by Cardinals defensive end Elvis Dumervil. After the play, Vick stomped on Dumervil's leg, apparently out of anger. Four days after the game, Virginia Tech officials learned of two misdemeanor charges of speeding and driving on a suspended or revoked driver's license that Vick received on December 17, 2005. Vick, who was forced to sit out the 2004 football season by the university due to previous legal incidents in his college career, was dismissed from the team on January 6, 2006, with the university citing \"a cumulative effect of legal infractions and unsportsmanlike play.\".[20] Redshirt sophomore quarterback Sean Glennon was set to take over for Vick in the 2006 season. Although consecutive losses to Georgia Tech and Boston College knocked the Hokies out of contention for the ACC Championship Game, the Tech team finished the season strong, winning six in a row and being invited to the 2006 Chick-fil-A Bowl in Atlanta. In the annual ACC vs SEC match-up, the Hokies played the Georgia Bulldogs. At halftime the Hokies led 21–3, but four second half Glennon turnovers helped the Bulldogs in coming back and winning 31–24. After the April 2007 Virginia Tech shootings that stunned the campus and nation, the remainder of Tech's spring practice was canceled. The Hokies, led by running back Brandon Ore on offense and linebackers Vince Hall and Xavier Adibi looked to be in contention for a berth in the National Championship. The 2007 home opener against the East Carolina Pirates was the subject of College GameDay, and the Hokies prevailed in an emotional, albeit shaky, game 17–7. They then traveled to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to play the LSU Tigers. In a game that saw Glennon replaced by true freshman quarterback Tyrod Taylor, the Hokies were completely dominated, only managing 149 total yards against the Tigers' 598. Taylor scored the only touchdown of the night after an 8-play, 65-yard drive. Taylor continued to start until an injury removed him from a 43–14 blowout of Duke. In a Thursday night match-up with Boston College, Glennon reclaimed his starting position. In a game plagued by rain storms and wet conditions, the Hokies took a 10–0 lead late into the fourth quarter. However, Eagles quarterback Matt Ryan spurred a late Boston College comeback, leading two TD drives in the final five minutes for a 14–10 win. Despite the devastating loss, Virginia Tech rebounded to win the remainder of its regular season games and claim the Coastal Division crown. A rematch with Boston College in the ACC Championship Game saw Tech fall behind early, tie the game by halftime, and then grind out a tense 30–16 win to advance to the Orange Bowl in Miami. After 29 seasons as head coach of Virginia Tech, legendary coach Frank Beamer retired following the conclusion of the 2015 season. He coached the Hokies to 23 consecutive bowl games, including a national championship appearance, along with seven conference championship titles. Beamer signed an 8-year contract with Virginia Tech, serving as an ambassador for the Athletic Department. During Beamer's tenure at Virginia Tech, putting points on the scoreboard became a full team effort with the offensive, defensive and special teams units. Often when the team scores one or more non-offensive touchdowns, the style of play is described as \"Beamerball\". Since Beamer's first season in 1987, a player at every position on the defensive unit has scored at least one touchdown, and 35 different players have scored touchdowns on Virginia Tech's special teams.[21] Sometime before the 1995 season, defensive coordinator Bud Foster wanted to give his defense something to rally around, an identity. A battered metal lunch pail was chosen as a symbol of a no-name, blue-collar defense. Each week a list of goals in put in the lunch pail and a player is chosen to have the honor of carrying the lunch pail onto the sidelines.[22][23][24] The Lunch Pail Defense Foundation was founded to fund academic scholarships for students from the area near Blacksburg, Virginia.[25] On November 27, 2015, former Memphis Head Coach, Justin Fuente was named the new head coach of the Virginia Tech Hokies. Fuente took over the team from the retiring, legendary coach Frank Beamer, following the 2015 Independence Bowl game. The Hokies finished Fuente's first year in 2016 with a regular season record of 9–3 and an overall record of 10–4. The Hokies became Coastal Division Champions for the 6th time and the first time since 2011. The Hokies played Clemson in the ACC Championship Game, losing 42–35. The team went to the 2016 Belk Bowl, in Charlotte, NC, defeating Arkansas, 35–24. Fuente was named the 2016 ACC Coach of the Year and he received many other accolades for the 2016 season. In 2017, the Hokies went 5–3 in ACC play, finishing second to Miami in the Coastal division, with an overall record of 9–4.[26] This result was good for a #22 ranking in the final 2017 CFB playoffs poll.[27] Earning a bowl game bid, Virginia Tech eventually lost to the Oklahoma State Cowboys 30–21 in the 2017 Camping World Bowl. The Hokies' performance slid under Fuente in their 2018 season. This time they finished fifth in the Coastal Division, posting a 4–4 conference standing and 6–7 overall record, losing their sole game against a ranked team.[28] They then lost 35–31 to the Cincincati Bearcats in the 2018 Military Bowl. Fuente steered Virginia Tech to better result in their 2019 campaign. The Hokies notched a 5–3 conference standing, ending up second to the Virginia Cavaliers in Coastal Conference play. In a dramatic game against the North Carolina Tarheels on October 19, 2019, the Hokies defeated their division rival 43–41 in 6 overtimes.[29] They went 1–1 against ranked opponents, with an overall record of 8–5.[30] Though the Hokies didn't have a final CFB playoff ranking, they did reprise their 2016 Belk Bowl appearance, this time facing the Kentucky Wildcats in the 2019 Belk Bowl, where they ended up losing 37–30.[31] The Hokies started the 2020 season ranked #24 in the preseason poll, ranking as high as #18 in by week four, then hovering around the top 20 until they eventually fell out of the poll after ranking #19 in week seven.[32] Fuente guided the team to a middling result, tallying a 5–5 ACC record and 5–6 overall standing.[33] Virginia Tech then ended its 27-year bowl game appearance record – the nation's longest streak at the time – opting to forgo postseason play. The challenges presented by the pandemic, combined with concerns over Fuente's performance, prompted the surprise announcement a day after a virtual press conference on Tuesday, December 15, 2020, called by Athletic Director Whit Babcock.[34][35] Virginia Tech kept Fuente at the helm as it began its 2021 season, producing a 4–4 ACC result and third-place finish in the Coastal Division, and a 6–7 overall record.[36] Fuente was fired with two regular season games remaining on November 16, 2021, after compiling an overall record of 43–31 in six seasons.[37] J. C. Price took over as interim coach to wrap-up the season. The Hokies then faced the Maryland Terrapins in the 2021 Pinstripe Bowl, losing 54–10. On November 30, 2021, the Hokies hired Penn State defensive coordinator and linebackers coach Brent Pry as the new head coach.[38] In his first season, the Hokies had a 3–8 record, 1–6 in the ACC. In year two, Pry led the Hokies to their first winning season since 2019. Tech trounced UVA 55–17 in the regular season finale in Charlottesville, to earn a bowl bid.[39] Then Tech beat Tulane 41–20 in the Military Bowl in Annapolis to finish 7–6. Virginia Tech claims 11 conference championships.[40]: 136–140 † Co-champions Virginia Tech won the ACC Championship in its inaugural season in the league in 2004. In 2005, the ACC Conference created two divisions, the Atlantic and Coastal, and a championship game between the divisions was established. Virginia Tech has appeared in the ACC Championship Game as the winner of the Coastal Division six times. Virginia Tech won the Coastal division in 2005 and played Florida State in the ACC Championship. Florida State won, 27–22. During the 2007 season, the Hokies once again took the Coastal division to set up a rematch of their earlier loss to Boston College. Virginia Tech prevailed 30–16. History repeated itself in 2008, when the Hokies defeated Boston College by a score of 30–12 after having lost to the Eagles during the regular season. In 2010 Virginia Tech went undefeated in league play, defeating Atlantic Division winner Florida State in the league championship game in Charlotte, North Carolina, 44–33. In 2011 Virginia Tech lost to Clemson for a 2nd time that season, their only two season losses. In 2016, Virginia Tech would fall short to Clemson, making a 3rd loss. † Co-champions The ACC eliminated Divisions for the 2023 season. The two teams with the highest winning percentage against other ACC teams play for the conference championship. Virginia Tech has played in 36 bowl games. The Hokies have appeared in several Gator, Peach, Sugar, Belk, Military and Orange bowls. Their overall record in bowl games is 14–22 through the 2024 season.[41] Virginia Tech and Virginia first met in 1895 and have played annually since the year 1970. Since 1964, the game has always been played at either Lane Stadium or Scott Stadium on the campuses of the two universities. But the series has at times been played in Richmond (1903, 1904, and 1957); Norfolk (1940, 1941, and 1942); and Roanoke (in 17 of the 19 years between 1945 and 1963). At 97 games, it is the longest series for the Hokies and second-longest for the Cavaliers, after the 118-game series between Virginia and North Carolina known as the South's Oldest Rivalry. The game counts for 1 point in the Commonwealth Clash each year, and is part of the greater Virginia–Virginia Tech rivalry. Virginia Tech leads in the Commonwealth Cup series 17–3[citation needed][when?] and the football series 58–38–5 as of 2019.[42] Three times this game has determined the Coastal Division champions with VT winning in 2007 and 2011, and UVA winning in 2019. The Hokies and West Virginia Mountaineers met 51 times between 1912 and 2005. The two teams played as conference foes from 1991 to 2003 as members of the Big East Conference (1979–2013). They met every year from 1973 to 2005. The Black Diamond Trophy is the trophy that goes to the winner of the game. It was introduced in 1997 and was meant to symbolize the Appalachian region's rich coal heritage (the phrase \"black diamond\" is often used as a term for coal.) Virginia Tech held the trophy in six of the nine years in which it was contested. The last two games played where on September 18, 2021, in Morgantown with West Virginia winning 27–21, and September 22, 2022, in Blacksburg with West Virginia winning 33–10. There are no further games scheduled in the series after the 2022 season. West Virginia leads the series 30–23–1 as of 2022.[43] The Hurricanes and Hokies first met on November 13, 1953, in Miami. Miami and Virginia Tech have met in two bowl games, the 1966 Liberty Bowl and 1981 Peach Bowl. The two teams have played annually since 1992, and the rivalry developed when the Hokies became a member of the Big East Conference for football in 1991. When the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) expanded in 2004, both Miami and Virginia Tech became members of the ACC. Both teams continue to compete annually as part of the ACC's Coastal Division. Miami leads the series 22–15 as of 2022.[44] The last game between the two teams was October 15, 2022, in Blacksburg, and Miami won 20–14. The two teams will next play during a yet to specified date in the 2025 season at Miami's home stadium, Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens. One of the Hokies' younger rivals is Georgia Tech. Prior to the Hokies joining the ACC in 2004, Virginia Tech and Georgia Tech had only met once previously (an additional scheduled meeting was canceled due to extreme weather). Since the ACC adopted divisional format for football, one of these two teams had represented the ACC Coastal Division in every ACC Championship Game except the 2013 season when Duke won the Coastal and 2015 when UNC won it. Over the years, the rivalry has become a significant annual matchup in the ACC, specifically when both teams are in both regularly in the AP Top 25 and the race for the Coastal Division championship. Virginia Tech leads the series 10–7 as of 2019, with Virginia Tech winning the past meeting.[45] The Boston College-Virginia Tech football rivalry began in 1993 with a 48–34 Boston College win in Chestnut Hill when the two teams began Big East conference round-robin play. When the two schools moved to the Atlantic Coast Conference the rivalry continued as the two schools were chosen as permanent cross-divisional rivals. The teams played twice in both the 2007 and 2008 seasons, as both teams won their respective divisions of the ACC and played each other in the conference championship. Although the Eagles defeated the Hokies in both the regular seasons those two years, Virginia Tech won the 2007 and 2008 ACC Championship Game played between the two schools. Virginia Tech leads the series 19–10 as of 2020, with Virginia Tech winning the past meeting.[46] Virginia Tech and VMI first met in 1894 and played annually from 1913 to 1971, usually in Roanoke on Thanksgiving Day. Like the current rivalry between VMI and The Citadel, the match-up was referred to as the Military Classic of the South, due to the military heritage of both schools. Starting again in 1973, the teams would continue to play on a yearly basis, making multiple appearances together in the Tobacco Bowl (1974, 1976) and Oyster Bowl (1980, 1982, 1984). The 1984 Oyster Bowl is the last time they played each other. However, in 2017, Virginia Tech and VMI agreed to a one-time rivalry matchup on September 5, 2026, at Lane Stadium. At 79 games, it is the second-longest series for the Hokies and fourth-longest for the Keydets. Due to the long pause of the VMI-VPI series, the Virginia–Virginia Tech rivalry has emerged as the dominant one in the state. Virginia Tech leads the series 49–25–5 as of 2019, with Virginia Tech winning the past six meetings. In 2002, the Virginia Tech athletics department developed a new policy on retiring jerseys. This special honor is bestowed to acknowledge an individual who has won an established national award in their sport. The Hokies has retired five numbers.[47] Additionally, Virginia Tech has four retired jerseys. These numbers can be worn normally by any player.[47] For the 2023 season, the ACC implemented a 3–5–5 scheduling system, with Pittsburgh, Virginia, and Wake Forest serving as the three teams played every year in a home-and-home basis.[48] On September 1, 2023, the ACC voted to add University of California, Berkeley, Southern Methodist University, and Stanford University to the conference starting in the 2024–25 school year,[49] which made the 3–5–5 schedule obsolete. Due to the expansion in 2024, the ACC is now scheduling games without a specific algorithm, and the conference released a schedule for 2024–2030 in October 2023.[50] Additionally, each season every ACC team schedules four non-conference games, including at least one against a \"Power 5\" team (which can include other ACC teams or FBS independent Notre Dame).[51] Announced opponents as of November 3, 2023.

                "content": "It was a brutally tough game in Cassell. FSU pressed the entire game, and the Lady Hokies just couldn’t get consistent stops. Turnovers and FSU points off of them made the difference in this one. Lessons to learn. GO HOKIES!!! Carnell Warren is a big addition if the Hokies can keep him. It’s the last preview of the 2024 season, and it’s actually 2025. Several changes and lots of portal and sit-out losses make it a tough call for the Hokies. Bud Foster’s going to be on the microphone and headset for this one for the defense. Take the poll, hazard a guess. GO HOKIES!!! This Virginia Tech team will look MUCH different than the team from the regular-season finale. The Hokies hung tough for a while. No, the bowl game hasn’t been played, so technically the season isn’t over, but in reality, the season is over, and it’s time to review the major issues facing the Hokies for 2025. Lots of changes already in the works, but let's look at the general issues. GO HOKIES!!! Another former Mountaineer transfers to Hokies. Seldon was Virginia’s top high school player in 2023. Another new defensive back for the Hokies. A big-time addition for the Hokies. This is a big get for Brent Pry. The Hokies continue reshaping their secondary. As 2024 and the non-conference schedule comes to a close it’s critical for the sake of momentum and depth to get a door closing win with the bench emptying. The Lady Hokies managed that well on Saturday. Carys Baker gets a double-double in the books. Matilda Ekh leads with 15, Mackie Nelson had 14, with Rose Micheaux getting back in double figures with 10. A busy couple of days for the Hokies, who add talent to the defensive backfield. A terrible second half dooms the Hokies. Well, the portal taketh away, but if you work it right it giveth back. The Hokies pick up three really important new players and manage to keep a critical player on defense. We also check the Fall graduate list and see and very favorite name. Isaiah Ford came back to school and earned his degree. GO HOKIES!!! The Hokies are finally on the board Is Michael Vick the new Coach Prime? It’s the post season, and the personnel roster activity is going on with wild abandon. The non-traditional stuff (Transfer Portal and NIL) is making a big mess, but there are still the traditional announcements that will mean serious next level consideration for some players. GOHOKIES!!! The Hokies are officially a feeder program. Hokies win their second in a row after six consecutive losses. Not many folks thought that Radford was going to pose a serious threat to the Lady Hokies, but there were some serious moments in the 1st quarter that made you wince a bit. Carleigh Wenzel and Lani White put on a show. Hokies Pull away and win big. GO HOKIES!!! Some good news for the Hokies. The first shoe in the changes to the Virginia Tech Hokie football coaching staff dropped this evening, rather late. We received official word from the program that Coaches Marve, Crook, and Strength and Conditioning Coach Gault have been let go. Delane has one year of eligibility remaining Let the fun begin. It’s been a very long road trip, and an unusual ACC opener in early December didn’t turn out as well as we had hoped. Playing Duke in their house is always a difficult proposition and the Hokies just ran into everything difficult in this one. GO HOKIES!!! The Hokies will travel pretty close to home for a much better bowl than we expected. The January 3rd Duke’s Mayo Bowl is a solid opportunity for the Hokies to grab another bowl victory in front of a crowd that promises to be full of Maroon and Orange. The opponent in this one is the B1G Minnesota Golden Gophers and it’s not going to be a cakewalk. GO HOKIES!!! It was close, but the Hokies struggle in the second half again. Incoming freshman QB AJ Brand earns a prestigious honor. As it turns out, there was one surprise during the early signing period. The long road trip for the Hokies had its first homeward bound stop over for an ACC/SEC challenge game. Who knows? December 4th might have been this team’s breakout. It was an exciting duel all the way to the final 3:29. It’s a huge quality road win for the Lady Hokies. GO HOKIES!!! South Carolina cornerback Jordan Crim is a Hokie. Two Hokies make first-team All-ACC. Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). Hope is here. GamblingHelpLineMA.org or call (800) 327-5050 for 24/7 support (MA).

How does the combination of alcohol and tobacco affect cancer risk? Can people's genes affect their risk of alcohol-related cancers? Can drinking red wine help prevent cancer? What happens to cancer risk after a person stops drinking alcohol? Is it safe for someone to drink alcohol while undergoing cancer chemotherapy? What is alcohol? Alcohol is the common term for ethanol or ethyl alcohol, a chemical substance found in alcoholic beverages such as beer, hard cider, malt liquor, wines, and distilled spirits (liquor). Alcohol is produced by the fermentation of sugars and starches by yeast. Alcohol is also found in some medicines, mouthwashes, and household products (including vanilla extract and other flavorings). This fact sheet focuses on cancer risks associated with the consumption of alcoholic beverages. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, a standard alcoholic drink in the United States contains 14.0 grams (0.6 ounces) of pure alcohol. Generally, this amount of pure alcohol is found in: These amounts are used by public health experts in developing health guidelines about alcohol consumption and to provide a way for people to compare the amounts of alcohol they consume. However, they may not reflect the typical serving sizes people may encounter in daily life. According to the federal government’s Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020–2025, individuals who do not drink alcohol should not start drinking for any reason. The Dietary Guidelines also recommends that people who drink alcohol do so in moderation by limiting consumption to 2 drinks or less in a day for men and 1 drink or less in a day for women. Heavy alcohol drinking is defined as having 4 or more drinks on any day or 8 or more drinks per week for women and 5 or more drinks on any day or 15 or more drinks per week for men. What is the evidence that alcohol drinking can cause cancer? There is a strong scientific consensus that alcohol drinking can cause several types of cancer (1, 2). In its Report on Carcinogens, the National Toxicology Program of the US Department of Health and Human Services lists consumption of alcoholic beverages as a known human carcinogen. The evidence indicates that the more alcohol a person drinks—particularly the more alcohol a person drinks regularly over time—the higher his or her risk of developing an alcohol-associated cancer. Even those who have no more than one drink per day and binge drinkers (those who consume 4 or more drinks for women and 5 or more drinks for men in one sitting) have a modestly increased risk of some cancers (3–7). Based on data from 2009, an estimated 3.5% of cancer deaths in the United States (about 19,500 deaths) were alcohol related (8). Clear patterns have emerged between alcohol consumption and the development of the following types of cancer: Numerous studies have examined whether there is an association between alcohol consumption and the risk of other cancers. For cancers of the ovary, prostate, stomach, uterus, and bladder, either no association with alcohol use has been found or the evidence for an association is inconsistent. However, evidence is accumulating that alcohol consumption is associated with increased risks of melanoma and of prostate and pancreatic cancers (4, 15). Alcohol consumption has also been associated with decreased risks of kidney cancers (16–18) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (19, 20) in multiple studies. However, any potential benefits of alcohol consumption for reducing the risks of some cancers are likely outweighed by the harms of alcohol consumption. In fact, a recent study that included data from more than 1,000 alcohol studies and data sources, as well as death and disability records from 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016, concluded that the optimal number of drinks to consume per day to minimize the overall risk to health is zero (21). That study did not include data on kidney cancer or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Alcohol consumption may also be associated with an increased risk of second primary cancers. For example, a meta-analysis of data from 19 studies showed that among patients with cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract (UADT)—which includes the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, and esophagus—for every 10 grams of alcohol consumed per day before the first UADT cancer diagnosis there was a 1.09-fold higher risk of a second primary UADT cancer (22). It is less clear whether alcohol consumption increases the risk of second primary cancers at other sites, such as the breast (23–25). How does alcohol affect the risk of cancer? Researchers have hypothesized multiple ways that alcohol may increase the risk of cancer, including Alcoholic beverages may also contain a variety of carcinogenic contaminants that are introduced during fermentation and production, such as nitrosamines, asbestos fibers, phenols, and hydrocarbons. The mechanisms by which alcohol consumption may decrease the risks of some cancers are not understood and may be indirect. How does the combination of alcohol and tobacco affect cancer risk? Epidemiologic research shows that people who use both alcohol and tobacco have much greater risks of developing cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx (throat), larynx, and esophagus than people who use either alcohol or tobacco alone. In fact, for oral and pharyngeal cancers, the risks associated with using both alcohol and tobacco are multiplicative; that is, they are greater than would be expected from adding the individual risks associated with alcohol and tobacco together (10, 26). Can people's genes affect their risk of alcohol-related cancers? A person’s risk of alcohol-related cancers is influenced by their genes, specifically the genes that encode enzymes involved in metabolizing (breaking down) alcohol (27). For example, one way the body metabolizes alcohol is through the activity of an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase, or ADH, which converts ethanol into the carcinogenic metabolite acetaldehyde, mainly in the liver. Recent evidence suggests that acetaldehyde production also occurs in the oral cavity and may be influenced by factors such as the oral microbiome (28, 29). Many individuals of East Asian descent carry a version of the gene for ADH that codes for a \"superactive\" form of the enzyme. This superactive ADH enzyme speeds the conversion of alcohol (ethanol) to toxic acetaldehyde. Among people of Japanese descent, those who have this form of ADH have a higher risk of pancreatic cancer than those with the more common form of ADH (30). Another enzyme, called aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), metabolizes toxic acetaldehyde to nontoxic substances. Some people, particularly those of East Asian descent, carry a variant of the gene for ALDH2 that encodes a defective form of the enzyme. In people who produce the defective enzyme, acetaldehyde builds up when they drink alcohol. The accumulation of acetaldehyde has such unpleasant effects (including facial flushing and heart palpitations) that most people who have inherited the ALDH2 variant are unable to consume large amounts of alcohol and therefore have a low risk of developing alcohol-related cancers. However, some individuals with the defective form of ALDH2 can become tolerant to the unpleasant effects of acetaldehyde and consume large amounts of alcohol. Epidemiologic studies have shown that such individuals have a higher risk of alcohol-related esophageal cancer, as well as of head and neck cancers, than individuals with the fully active enzyme who drink comparable amounts of alcohol (31). These increased risks are seen only among people who carry the ALDH2 variant and drink alcohol—they are not observed in people who carry the variant but do not drink alcohol. Can drinking red wine help prevent cancer? The plant secondary compound resveratrol, found in grapes used to make red wine and some other plants, has been investigated for many possible health effects, including cancer prevention. However, researchers have found no association between moderate consumption of red wine and the risk of developing prostate cancer (32) or colorectal cancer (33). What happens to cancer risk after a person stops drinking alcohol? Most of the studies that have examined whether cancer risk declines after a person stops drinking alcohol have focused on head and neck cancers and on esophageal cancer. In general, these studies have found that stopping alcohol consumption is not associated with immediate reductions in cancer risk. The cancer risks eventually decline, although it may take years for the risks of cancer to return to those of never drinkers. For example, ex-drinkers still had higher risks of oral cavity and pharyngeal cancers than never drinkers even 16 years after they stopped drinking alcohol, although it was lower than before they stopped drinking (34). One study estimated that it would take more than 35 years for the higher risks of laryngeal and pharyngeal cancers associated with alcohol consumption to decrease to the level of never drinkers (35). Is it safe for someone to drink alcohol while undergoing cancer chemotherapy? As with most questions related to a specific individual’s cancer treatment, it is best for patients to check with their health care team about whether it is safe to drink alcohol during or immediately following chemotherapy treatment. The doctors and nurses administering the treatment will be able to give specific advice about whether it is safe to consume alcohol while undergoing specific cancer treatments.

Drinking alcohol raises your risk of getting several kinds of cancer: Some studies show that drinking three or more alcoholic drinks per day increases the risk of stomach and pancreatic cancers. Drinking alcohol may also increase prostate cancer risk. All alcoholic drinks—including red and white wine, beer, and liquor—are linked with cancer. Drinking less alcohol is better for your health than drinking more. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that adults of legal drinking age (21 years or older) choose not to drink alcohol or to drink alcohol in moderation (2 drinks or less in a day for men, 1 drink or less in a day for women). If you're taking prescription medicine, including cancer treatment, ask your doctor if it's safe to drink alcohol. When you drink alcohol, your body breaks it down into a chemical that damages your DNA. DNA is the cell's \"instruction manual\" that controls how a cell grows and does its job. When DNA is damaged, a cell can grow out of control and become cancer. For more information, see the National Cancer Institute's Alcohol and Cancer Risk web page. Each year, about 20,000 adults in the United States die from alcohol-related cancers. It is estimated most of these deaths may have been avoided if all adults had followed the recommended limits on alcohol use in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans instead of drinking above them. You can drink less alcohol or choose not to drink. You can use this tool to check your alcohol use. Talk with your doctor if you have concerns about your drinking.

Citation of the source is appreciated. Alcohol consumption has been linked to an increased risk for various types of cancer. A combined analysis of more than 200 studies assessing the link between alcohol and various types of cancer (i.e., a meta-analysis) sought to investigate this association in more detail. This meta-analysis found that alcohol most strongly increased the risks for cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, esophagus, and larynx. Statistically significant increases in risk also existed for cancers of the stomach, colon, rectum, liver, female breast, and ovaries. Several mechanisms have been postulated through which alcohol may contribute to an increased risk of cancer. Concurrent tobacco use, which is common among drinkers, enhances alcohol’s effects on the risk for cancers of the upper digestive and respiratory tract. The analysis did not identify a threshold level of alcohol consumption below which no increased risk for cancer was evident. Keywords: AOD (alcohol or other drug) consumption; chronic AODE (effects of AOD use, abuse, and dependence); cancer; carcinogenesis; oral disorder; esophageal disorder; dose-response relationship; gender differences; tobacco in any form; distilled alcoholic beverage; drug concentration; risk analysis; meta-analysis Regular alcohol consumption can have numerous consequences, beneficial or detrimental, on the health of the drinker. For example, light-to-moderate alcohol consumption1 may protect against certain types of heart disease and stroke. Conversely, heavy drinking has been associated with liver disease; cardiovascular disease; disorders of the digestive tract; and illness or death from alcohol-related injuries, motor vehicle crashes, and violence. Another group of disorders that has been linked to drinking is cancer, particularly cancers of the upper airway and digestive tract (e.g., mouth, pharynx, larynx, and esophagus). Although alcohol has not been shown to cause cancer (i.e., be carcinogenic) in animal studies, strong epidemiological evidence indicates that consumption of alcoholic beverages increases the risk of those cancers. Alcohol consumption also is associated with primary liver cancer. This relationship is difficult to investigate in epidemiological studies, however, because it is more indirect. Thus, alcohol causes cirrhosis of the liver in a substantial proportion of heavy drinkers, which then can lead to liver cancer. In addition, heavy alcohol consumption can increase the drinker’s risk for infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV), which in turn can also result in liver cancer (for more information on the relationship between alcohol consumption and HCV infection, see the article in this issue by Lieber, pp. 245–254). Alcohol consumption also has been linked to cancers of the large bowel (i.e., colon and rectum) in both men and women and to breast cancer in women, although these associations have not yet been proven unequivocally. Nevertheless, because these are the two most common types of cancer in developed countries after lung cancer, even a moderate increase in risk may result in a relatively large number of additional cases and therefore have important public health implications. The association between alcohol consumption and other types of cancer (e.g., stomach, pancreatic, prostate, and endometrial cancer) is still controversial (International Agency for Research on Cancer [IARC] 1988; Doll et al. 1999). The increased risk of cancer among heavy drinkers is primarily attributed to the alcohol (chemically referred to as ethanol) in alcoholic beverages. Thus, the risk tends to increase with the overall amount of ethanol consumed. It is still unclear, however, whether any defined consumption threshold exists below which no increased risk for cancer is evident (IARC 1988; Doll et al. 1999). To evaluate the overall effects of alcohol on the cancer risk of a population, one must accurately quantify its effects on various types of tumors. To this end, researchers have performed comprehensive meta-analyses of published studies investigating the relationship between alcohol intake and the risk for numerous types of cancer. Meta-analyses are studies that pool data from several studies, thereby substantially enhancing the overall number of cases evaluated. This approach allows researchers to detect relationships that may have been overlooked in the individual studies because of the relatively small sample size and insufficient statistical power of those individual studies. This article summarizes the major findings of one such meta-analysis (Corrao et al. 1999, 2000). To identify scientific articles to include in the meta-analysis, the researchers followed three steps: First, they conducted a search of several bibliographic databases (e.g., MEDLINE, Current Contents, EMBASE, CAB Abstracts, and Core Biomedical Collection) for studies published between 1966 and 2000. Second, the investigators reviewed all references in the resulting articles to identify any studies that had not been found in the database search. And third, to ensure that the list of studies included was as complete as possible, the investigators conducted a manual search of the most relevant journals of epidemiology and medicine and compared their search results with those of other general reviews and meta-analyses published on this topic. Each article identified by this search process was reviewed and included in the analysis if it met the following three criteria: The article was a case-control or a cohort study published as an original article. Case-control studies compare people with a certain disease (e.g., cancer)—the cases—with a similar group of people without the disease— the controls. Investigators then collect information (e.g., regarding alcohol consumption) for both groups to determine whether differences exist between the groups. For example, significant differences between the groups with respect to alcohol intake suggest that alcohol was a causative factor in the disease. Cohort studies follow a group of initially healthy people over a prolonged period of time. At the outset, the investigators determine the participants’ drinking patterns so that they can relate drinking patterns and disease development during the followup period. The findings of the study were expressed as relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR) and considered at least three levels of alcohol consumption. The RR determines the strength of the relationship between a variable (e.g., alcohol consumption) and the development of a disease. The RR for a disease among people without the variable (e.g., among abstainers) is defined as 1.0. A RR among people with the variable (e.g., among drinkers) of greater than 1.0 indicates that the variable increases the risk of the disease. Conversely, an RR of less than 1.0 indicates that the variable has a protective effect. (The OR is used to estimate the RR under certain conditions.) The article reported the number of cases and non-cases (i.e., controls in case-control studies and person-time exposed during the followup in a cohort study) and estimates of the RR or OR for each exposure level. Two readers, who received no information on the names and affiliations of the authors of each study or the alcohol-related results, independently determined the eligibility of each article for inclusion in the meta-analysis. When the results of a study were published in more than one article, only the most recent and complete article was included in the analysis. To estimate the effect of alcohol consumption on the risk for each type of cancer studied, based on the pooled data from all studies included in the meta-analysis, the investigators used meta-regression models—statistical models developed specifically for such analyses (Corrao et al. 1999, 2000). For a more detailed description of these statistical analyses, see the textbox, p. 265, and the articles by Corrao and colleagues (1999, 2000). To determine the effects of alcohol on the risk for various types of cancer, the researchers used three statistical methods. They first pooled the original published data for each type of cancer. Subsequently, they determined the relationship between alcohol consumption and the risk for a given type of cancer by fitting to the pooled data several statistical models called fractional models (Royston et al. 1999). Such models can identify trends (e.g., J- or U-shaped curves) as well as other relationships between alcohol exposure levels and relative risks. The investigators then chose the best-fitting model to summarize the relation of interest (Corrao et al. 1999). Next, they assessed whether gender modified the effect of alcohol on the risk for each neoplasm. They also looked at the effect of adjusting the reported estimates for smoking when examining tobacco-related types of cancer. Finally, the researchers evaluated the variability (i.e., heterogeneity) among the studies’ results according to methods proposed by Greenland and Longnecker (1992). In all, 229 studies (183 case-control studies and 46 cohort studies) met the eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. These studies, which reported a total of 115,199 cases, investigated alcohol’s effects on the risk for developing cancer at a total of 19 sites in the body or at all sites combined (see the table and figure for a summary of the studies and their findings for each of those sites). For five of the cancer sites (i.e., small intestine, gall bladder, skin [melanoma], cervix, and kidney), alcohol’s effects were analyzed in only one or two studies; in these cases, the researchers could not calculate the pooled RR or 95-percent confidence interval (95% CI).2 For all other cancer sites, both the pooled RR and the 95% CI were determined for three levels of alcohol consumption (i.e., 25, 50, and 100 grams of alcohol per day, corresponding to approximately 2, 4, and 8 standard drinks3 per day, respectively). For most of the tumor types included in the studies, the analysis found a dose-dependent increase in risk from alcohol consumption—that is, greater alcohol consumption was associated with a greater increase in risk. Alcohol most strongly increased the risks for cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx (RR=5.7 for the highest alcohol consumption level), esophagus (RR=4.2) and larynx (RR=3.2). Appreciably smaller, although still statistically significant at the 5-percent level,4 increases in risk existed for cancers of the stomach, colon, rectum, liver, female breast, and ovaries. The smallest increases in risk were observed for cancers of the lung (RR=1.1 at the highest consumption level) and prostate (RR=1.2). For all these types of cancer, significant increases in risk existed even at the lowest consumption level studied here (i.e., 25 grams of alcohol, or two standard drinks per day). In contrast, no significant relationship existed between alcohol consumption and the risk for pancreas, endometrial, and bladder cancers. With the exceptions of cancers of the ovary, prostate, and bladder, significant heterogeneity across studies existed for each type of cancer; this means that results vary greatly among the various studies analyzed, so an overall summary of average effect across studies must be taken with caution. The researchers also investigated whether gender modified the effect of alcohol intake on the risk for each type of cancer. Statistically significant gender differences existed only for esophageal and liver cancer—where the alcohol-related risk was higher in women than in men—but not for other types of cancer. The results of eight appropriate studies were pooled to determine the relationship between alcohol consumption and the risk of cancer at all sites combined. This analysis found that alcohol consumption of at least 50 grams (i.e., 4 standard drinks) per day significantly increased the risk of developing any type of cancer. As with other meta-analyses of published studies, the analysis presented here has various limitations and strengths. One limitation is that for most types of cancer included, the estimates of alcohol’s effects tended to vary widely among the individual studies, making interpretation of the pooled data more difficult. Part of this variability may result from differences in the characteristics of the subjects included in the studies. For example, the gender of the study participants may play a role because potential differences in alcohol breakdown (i.e., metabolism) exist between men and women and may systematically influence the overall pooled estimates (Corrao et al. 1999, 2000). To control for this possibility, the investigators included separate analyses for men and women in their statistical models, where feasible. However, gender explained a significant portion of the observed variability in study results only for esophageal and liver cancer, but not for other types of cancers. Another limitation of this and other meta-analyses is that alcohol consumption levels may have been systematically underreported in several studies, leading to biased RR estimates. The statistical power of this meta-analysis also is somewhat limited because, although it included more than 115,000 cases, the numbers of cases for certain types of cancers (e.g., cervix and melanoma) were relatively small. Similarly, for certain cancers, there were only a few cases with certain levels of alcohol consumption (e.g., high levels of alcohol consumption in female breast cancer patients). Furthermore, biases resulting from confounding factors may have affected the pooled estimates. A confounding factor is a variable that is related to both the exposure variable (e.g., alcohol consumption) and the risk of disease (e.g., cancer). For example, alcohol intake may appear to be positively associated with lung cancer but the actual association may be confounded by cigarette smoking, which is related with both alcohol intake (because people who smoke also tend to drink) and the risk of lung cancer. Summary of the Studies Included in the Meta-Analysis NOTE: Table gives the pooled relative risks (RR) and corresponding 95-percent confidence intervals (95% CI) for three alcohol consumption levels. Those levels specified corresponded to approximately two, four, and eight standard drinks per day, respectively. The effects of gender and differences (i.e., heterogeneity) in the study results for various cancer sites also are presented. The RR indicates the strength of the relationship between alcohol consumption and a given type of cancer. A RR greater than 1.0 means that alcohol consumption at the level indicated increased the risk for that type of cancer. The greater the value over 1.0, the greater the risk. The 95-percent confidence intervals indicate the range of RR that is 95 percent likely to show a true RR. A statistically significant heterogeneity level indicates that results varied greatly among the various studies analyzed and that, therefore, an overall summary of average effect across studies must be interpreted with caution. The number of individual studies does not add up to the total shown because several studies examined more than one type of cancer. For this type of cancer, the RRs associated with alcohol consumption for males and females are listed separately because a statistically significant difference existed between the two sexes. n.s. = not significant One of the strengths of this meta-analysis is that the investigators performed a separate analysis of studies that also reported estimates adjusted for tobacco use, which contributes to various forms of cancer, prominently lung cancer. Such analyses were conducted for most cancers of the upper airways and digestive tract, as well as for lung and bladder cancer. These analyses found that tobacco use had a substantial modifying effect not only on the alcohol-related risks for lung and bladder cancer but also on the risk for laryngeal cancer. For example, when the investigators considered only studies reporting RRs not adjusted for tobacco use, the pooled RR for lung cancer at the highest level of alcohol consumption was 6.30. When they excluded such studies from the analysis and considered only studies reporting estimates adjusted for tobacco use, however, the pooled RR declined to 1.07. This finding indicates that alcohol itself only weakly increases the risk for lung cancer and that lung cancer risk primarily results from tobacco use, which is common in heavy drinkers. For laryngeal cancer, tobacco use also substantially influences the risk, though a strong association with alcohol consumption, indicated by a RR of 3.24, remained even when considering only studies presenting adjusted estimates. The association between various levels of alcohol consumption and an increased risk of liver cancer remains difficult to interpret even with the pooled data used in this meta-analysis. This difficulty results from the fact that, as discussed earlier, the association between alcohol consumption and liver cancer is only indirect. Furthermore, patients with liver cancer resulting from cirrhosis typically have reduced their alcohol consumption by the time they develop liver cancer (Aricò et al. 1994). This change in consumption levels may lead to an underestimate of the real association. Researchers have known about the relationship between heavy alcohol consumption and the risk for esophageal and other upper digestive and respiratory tract cancers since the beginning of the last century. Furthermore, substantial epidemiological evidence (as reviewed in this article) accrued over the past 50 years has shown that alcohol contributes to the development of these cancers. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying alcohol-related cancer development remain largely unclear. To date, no experimental evidence indicates that alcohol by itself can cause cancer—that is, that alcohol can act as a complete carcinogen. Over the past few decades, however, several animal studies have indicated that alcohol can have a cocarcinogenic, or cancer-promoting, effect. This means that when alcohol is administered together with other known cancer-inducing agents (i.e., carcinogens), it promotes or accelerates cancer development. This effect was noted for several digestive tract cancers, specifically cancers of the esophagus and the nonglandular forestomach5 (Doll et al. 1999). For other cancers of the digestive tract (e.g., stomach, pancreas, colon, and rectum), however, the results are less clear and generally are variable across studies, possibly because of differences in study design. Researchers also have no clear understanding of the potential mechanisms through which alcohol might act as a cocarcinogen at these sites (IARC 1988; Doll et al. 1999). Moreover, the RR estimates based on the pooled data in this meta-analysis ranged from 1.1 to 1.3 for the highest level of alcohol intake. These values indicate only a weak association of alcohol with these types of cancer, which may possibly result from residual bias in the analysis or from confounding factors, such as diet. Therefore, one cannot draw any conclusions regarding a potential causal role of alcohol in the development of these cancers. For female breast cancer, the meta-analysis described here confirms the existence of a strong dose-risk relationship between alcohol consumption level and breast cancer risk. The exact role of alcohol in the development of breast cancer remains unclear. It is possible, however, that for breast cancer and other types of cancer related to disturbances in female hormone levels, alcohol may act by altering the metabolism and blood levels of female hormones, such as estrogen (Longnecker 1994). Moreover, a recent study suggests that the association may be limited to women with a family history of breast cancer (Vachon et al. 2001). Alcohol and tobacco enhance each other’s effects (i.e., act synergistically) on the risk for cancers of the upper digestive and respiratory tract.6 Studies conducted in North America, France, and Italy have shown extremely high RRs for certain cancers among people who both drink and smoke heavily (Doll et al. 1999). For example, in a series of case-control studies conducted in Italy, the RRs for the highest exposure levels to both risk factors were 80 for cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx, 12 for laryngeal cancer, and 18 for esophageal cancer (Franceschi et al. 1990). From a public health view, this synergism implies that over 75 percent of cancers of the upper digestive and respiratory tract in developed countries are attributable to alcohol and tobacco. Accordingly, the cessation or moderation of tobacco and/or alcohol use could avoid the majority of these cancer cases. Relationship between increasing amounts of alcohol and risk (i.e., relative risk or RR) for 14 types of cancer. The RR describes the strength of the relationship between a variable (e.g., alcohol consumption) and a disease (e.g., cancer). The RR for the disease in people without the variable (e.g., abstainers) is defined as 1.0. A RR among the people with the variable (e.g., drinkers) of greater than 1.0 indicates that the variable increases the risk for the disease. The greater the value, the greater the risk. The curves shown here were obtained by fitting certain statistical models to the data from several studies (i.e., a meta-analysis). Blue dotted lines indicate 95-percent confidence intervals; that is, the range of RR that is 95 percent likely to show a true RR. The synergism between alcohol and tobacco also implies that cancers of the upper digestive and respiratory tract in Europe and North America are extremely rare among people who have never smoked, and only limited data are available on the effects of alcohol in those “never-smokers.” Those limited data indicate that for oral and pharyngeal cancers (Fioretti et al. 1999; Talamini et al. 1998) as well as for esophageal cancer (Doll et al. 1999), high alcohol consumption in people who have never smoked is directly associated with an increased risk for these types of cancer. (For laryngeal cancer, the evidence in this respect is inconsistent.) The substances contained in tobacco products are not the only carcinogenic agents to which the upper digestive tract is exposed, however, and alcohol may facilitate or promote the effects of other carcinogens present in the diet or other environmental exposures. Researchers have made several attempts to determine whether different types of alcoholic beverages have different effects on cancer risk. Some studies found no apparent differences in the cancer risks associated with various beverages, whereas others have reported greater risks with spirits than with wine or beer (Doll et al. 1999). Researchers conducting a study in Normandy, France (Tuyns et al. 1979), reported an increased risk of esophageal cancer associated with apple-based drinks (e.g., apple brandy and hard cider). Two studies from Italy (Barra et al. 1990; Bosetti et al. 2000) found that people who consumed only wine had greater risks of oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal cancer compared with people who consumed wine as well as distilled spirits or beer after adjusting for the overall amount of alcohol consumed. Conversely, a Danish study found no excess risk for cancer of the upper digestive tract associated with wine consumption (Gronbaek et al. 1998). Taken together, these findings appear to indicate that the most frequently consumed beverage in each region or country tends to be the beverage associated with the highest estimated RR. However, this topic requires further study. Some researchers have suggested that drinks containing higher alcohol concentrations are more deleterious per gram of alcohol than drinks with lower alcohol concentrations. The evidence for this hypothesis, however, is weak and inconclusive (Doll et al. 1999). This meta-analysis includes most published information on alcohol and cancer and, the limitations discussed above notwithstanding, consequently provides the most accurate estimates of the RRs for common cancers considered to be alcohol-related. Some of the findings are novel and of specific relevance. For example, the analysis was unable to identify a threshold level of alcohol consumption below which no increased risk for cancer is evident. Furthermore, this meta-analysis found that the association of alcohol with the risk for oral and pharyngeal cancer appears to be stronger than the association with esophageal or laryngeal cancer across increasing levels of alcohol intake. In terms of risk assessment, this meta-analysis confirms that high levels of alcohol consumption (i.e., more than four drinks per day) result in a substantial risk of cancer development at several sites. Lower levels of consumption result in a moderately increased risk for various cancers. At the same time, other studies have shown that moderate alcohol consumption can have protective effects against certain types of heart disease. Accordingly, one must determine whether moderate alcohol consumption results in an overall favorable or unfavorable risk-benefit balance for the individual drinker or an entire population. This balance depends on the age, gender, and baseline disease rates among the members of a given population. In addition, genetic factors also may influence a person’s risk-benefit balance as suggested by the previously mentioned findings that the association between alcohol consumption and female breast cancer may be limited to women with a family history of breast cancer (i.e., with predisposing genetic factors) (Vachon et al. 2001). Consequently, any definite risk-benefit assessment for moderate alcohol drinking requires much more far-reaching analyses that are beyond the scope of this article but that in the future may provide important information from a public health perspective. Ms. Ivana Garimoldi provided editorial assistance in the preparation of this article. The definitions of light, moderate, and heavy alcohol consumption vary across studies. In the United States, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture have defined moderate drinking as no more than one drink per day for women and no more than two drinks per day for men. Statistical analyses generally do not lead to a calculated, accurate result but instead provide an estimate of the result. The 95% CI is the range of the value under investigation that with a 95-percent likelihood contains the true value. In the United States, a standard drink frequently is defined as 0.5 ounces (oz) or 14 grams of pure alcohol. This alcohol amount is found in 12 fluid oz of beer, 5 fluid oz of wine, and 1.5 fluid oz of 80-proof distilled spirits. Statistically significant means that the observed result would occur by chance under hypothesized conditions less than a specified proportion of the time (usually 5 percent). These studies were conducted in hamsters. The stomach of a hamster is divided into a portion that does not contain glands which secrete digestive enzymes (i.e., nonglandular forestomach) and a portion closer to the intestine that does contain such glands. Similarly, synergistic effects have been reported between high alcohol consumption and dietary factors, such as low consumption of fruits and vegetables.

                "content": "The Boston Celtics (/ˈsɛltɪks/ SEL-tiks[a]) are an American professional basketball team based in Boston. The Celtics compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference. Founded in 1946 as one of the league's original eight teams, the Celtics play their home games at TD Garden, a shared arena with the NHL's Boston Bruins. The Celtics are commonly regarded as the most successful team in NBA history and hold the records for most NBA championships won, with 18, and most recorded wins of any NBA franchise.[11][12] The Celtics' rise to dominance began in the late 1950s, after the team, led by coach Red Auerbach, acquired Bill Russell in 1956, later becoming the cornerstone of the Celtics dynasty. Led by Russell, Bob Cousy, and Tom Heinsohn, the Celtics won their first NBA championship in 1957. Russell, along with a talented supporting cast of future Hall of Famers including Heinsohn, Don Nelson, K. C. Jones, John Havlicek, Sam Jones, Satch Sanders, and Bill Sharman, would usher the Celtics into the greatest period in franchise history, winning eight consecutive NBA championships from 1959 to 1966. After Russell became the team's player-coach, as well as the first African American head coach in any United States sport, they won back-to-back titles in 1968 and 1969. The Celtics entered a period of rebuilding after Russell retired in 1969. In the mid-1970s, the Celtics became contenders once again, winning championships in 1974 and 1976 under the leadership of head coach Tom Heinsohn with Dave Cowens, Havlicek, and Jo Jo White. In the 1980s, the Celtics returned to dominance. Anchored by the \"Big Three\" of Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, and Robert Parish, the team experienced a renewed rivalry with the \"Showtime\" Lakers and won championships in 1981, 1984, and 1986, the latter two with head coach K. C. Jones against the Lakers. After the retirements of Bird and McHale, the departure of Parish, and the untimely deaths of 1986 draft pick Len Bias and star player Reggie Lewis, the Celtics struggled through the 1990s and much of the early 2000s. After another period of rebuilding, the Celtics assembled a new \"Big Three\" around team captain Paul Pierce by acquiring Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett in the 2007 offseason. Under the leadership of head coach Doc Rivers, the team defeated the Lakers to win their 17th championship in 2008, while also losing to the Lakers in the 2010 Finals. Allen, Garnett, and Pierce were no longer with the team by the start of the 2013–14 season, with Garnett and Pierce being traded to the Brooklyn Nets for four total future first round picks. With two of these first round picks, the team drafted Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Led by \"The Jays\", the team returned to the NBA Finals in 2022, losing to the Golden State Warriors, and defeated the Dallas Mavericks in 2024 to secure their 18th championship. The \"Celtics\" nickname and the team's mascot \"Lucky the Leprechaun\" are nods to Boston's historically large Irish population, and also to the Original Celtics, a barnstorming basketball team that played in the early 20th century.[13] The Celtics have a notable rivalry with the Los Angeles Lakers, who are second in NBA history with 17 championships. The teams' rivalry was especially pronounced in the 1960s and 1980s. The Celtics have played the Lakers a record 12 times in the NBA Finals and have defeated them nine times. 41 members of Basketball Hall of Fame have played for the Celtics at least once in their careers. Four Celtics players (Bob Cousy, Bill Russell, Dave Cowens and Larry Bird) have won the NBA Most Valuable Player award; overall, Celtics players have won an NBA-record 10 MVP awards.[14] The Boston Celtics were formed on June 6, 1946, by Boston Garden-Arena Corporation president Walter A. Brown as a team in the Basketball Association of America. In 1948, the team earned its first playoff appearance, only to lose to the Chicago Stags 4–1. In 1949, the team missed the playoffs, fifth in the Eastern Division. Then, on August 3, 1949, the team became part of the National Basketball Association following the merger of the BAA and rival National Basketball League.[15][16] In 1950, the Celtics signed Chuck Cooper, becoming the first NBA franchise to draft a black player.[17] Chuck Connors of The Rifleman fame was an original member of the Celtics in 1946.[18] The Celtics struggled during their early years, until the hiring of coach Red Auerbach.[19] In the franchise's early days, Auerbach had no assistants, ran all the practices, did all the scouting—both of opposing teams and college draft prospects—and scheduled all road trips. One of the first great players to join the Celtics was Bob Cousy, whom Auerbach initially refused to draft out of nearby Holy Cross because he was \"too flashy\".[20] Cousy's contract eventually became the property of the Chicago Stags,[21] but when that franchise went bankrupt, Cousy went to the Celtics in a dispersal draft. After the 1955–56 season, Auerbach made a stunning trade, sending perennial All-Star Ed Macauley to the St. Louis Hawks along with the draft rights to Cliff Hagan for the second overall pick in the draft.[22] After negotiating with the Rochester Royals—a negotiation that included a promise that the Celtics owner would send the highly sought-after Ice Capades to Rochester if the Royals would let Russell slide to No. 2—Auerbach used the pick to select University of San Francisco center Bill Russell.[23] Auerbach also acquired Holy Cross standout, and 1957 NBA Rookie of the Year, Tom Heinsohn.[24] Both Russell and Heinsohn worked extraordinarily well with Cousy, and they were the players around whom Auerbach would build the champion Celtics for more than a decade.[24] With Bill Russell, the Celtics advanced to the 1957 NBA Finals and defeated the St. Louis Hawks in seven games, earning their first NBA title.[25] In 1958, the Celtics again advanced to the NBA Finals, this time losing to the Hawks in 6 games.[26] Following the acquisition of K.C. Jones in 1958, the Celtics began a dynasty that would last for more than a decade.[27] In 1959, the Celtics won the NBA championship after sweeping the Minneapolis Lakers, the first of their record eight consecutive championships.[28] During that time, the Celtics met the Lakers in the Finals five times, starting an intense and often bitter rivalry that has spanned generations. In 1964, the Celtics became the first NBA team to have an all African-American starting lineup. On December 26, 1964, Willie Naulls replaced an injured Tom Heinsohn, joining Tom 'Satch' Sanders, K.C. Jones, Sam Jones, and Bill Russell in the starting lineup. The Celtics defeated St. Louis 97–84. Boston won its next 11 games with Naulls starting in place of Heinsohn.[29] The Celtics of the late 1950s–1960s are widely considered one of the most dominant teams of all time.[30] Auerbach retired as coach after the 1965–66 season and Russell took over as player-coach, which was Auerbach's ploy to keep Russell interested.[31] With his appointment Russell became the first African-American coach in any U.S. pro sport. Auerbach would remain the general manager, a position he would hold well into the 1980s. However, the Celtics' string of NBA titles ended when they lost to the Philadelphia 76ers in the 1967 Eastern Conference Finals. The aging team managed two more championships in 1968 and 1969, defeating the Los Angeles Lakers each time.[32] Russell retired after the 1969 season, effectively ending a Celtics dynasty that had garnered an unrivaled 11 NBA titles in 13 seasons.[33] The team's run of 8 consecutive is the longest championship streak in U.S. professional sports history,[34] with Russell's 11 titles being the most won by an NBA player. The 1969–70 season was a rebuilding year, as the Celtics had their first losing record since the 1949–50 season. However, with the acquisition of Paul Silas and future Hall of Famers Dave Cowens[35] and Jo Jo White,[36] the Celtics soon became dominant again. After losing in the Eastern Conference Finals in 1972, the Celtics regrouped and came out determined in 1973 and posted an excellent 68–14 regular season record. But the season ended in disappointment, as they were upset in seven games by the New York Knicks in the Conference Finals. John Havlicek injured his right shoulder in game six and was forced to play game seven shooting left-handed.[37] The Celtics returned to the playoffs the next year, defeating the Milwaukee Bucks in the 1974 NBA Finals for their 12th NBA championship.[38] Boston took a 3–2 series lead and had a chance to claim the title on their home court. The Bucks won Game Six in Boston when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar nestled in a hook shot with 3 seconds left in the game's second overtime, and the series returned to Milwaukee. Cowens was the hero in Game 7, scoring 28 points, as the Celtics brought the title back to Boston for the first time in five years. In 1976, the team won yet another championship, defeating the Phoenix Suns in six games. The Finals featured one of the greatest games in NBA history. With the series tied at two games apiece, the Suns trailed early in the Boston Garden, but came back to force overtime. In double overtime, a Gar Heard turn-around jumper at the top of the key sent the game to a third overtime, at which point the Celtics prevailed.[39] After the 1976 championship and a playoff appearance in 1977, Boston went into another rebuilding phase. In the 1977 NBA draft, the Celtics drafted a young forward from UNC Charlotte named Cedric Maxwell.[40] \"Cornbread\" Maxwell did not contribute much in his rookie season, but he showed promise. Auerbach's job became even tougher following the 1977–78 season in which they went 32–50 as Havlicek, the Celtics' all-time leading scorer, retired after 16 seasons.[41] The Celtics owned two of the top eight picks in the 1978 NBA draft.[42] Auerbach took a risk by selecting junior Larry Bird of Indiana State with the sixth overall pick, knowing that Bird would stay in college for his senior year but believing that his potential would make him worth the wait. The team retained Bird's rights for one year and signed him soon after he led Indiana State to the NCAA championship game. In 1978, Celtics owner Irv Levin traded franchises with Buffalo Braves owner John Y. Brown Jr.[43] Two weeks before the swap of franchises was made official, details of a six-player trade between the two teams were reported. Boston sent Freeman Williams, Kevin Kunnert, and Kermit Washington to the Braves for \"Tiny\" Archibald, Billy Knight, and Marvin Barnes.[44] The move turned Boston fans against Brown, both because Kunnert and Washington were seen as key pieces of the team's future and because Auerbach publicly stated that he was not consulted about the trade.[44] The relationship between Brown and Auerbach worsened with Brown's decision to acquire Bob McAdoo in February 1979,[45] in exchange for three first-round draft picks that Auerbach had planned to use to rebuild the franchise.[46] Again, Brown made the trade without consulting Auerbach.[47] Auerbach almost left Boston to take a job with the New York Knicks as a result.[46] With public support strongly behind Auerbach, Brown sold the team to Harry Mangurian in 1979 rather than run the risk of losing his famed general manager.[48][49] The Celtics would struggle through the season, going 29–53.[50] Newcomers Chris Ford, Rick Robey, Cedric Maxwell and Nate Archibald failed to reverse the team's momentum.[51] Larry Bird debuted for the Celtics during the 1979–80 season.[52] With a new owner in place, Auerbach made a number of moves that would bring the team back to prominence. He almost immediately traded McAdoo,[53] a former NBA scoring champion, to the Detroit Pistons for guard M. L. Carr, a defensive specialist, and two first-round picks in the 1980 NBA draft.[49] He also picked up point guard Gerald Henderson from the CBA. Carr, Archibald, Henderson and Ford formed a highly competent backcourt, blending in well with the talented frontcourt of Cowens, Maxwell and Bird. With Bird winning NBA Rookie of the Year honors[54] the team went 61–21, a 32-game improvement from the previous season. Playing strong in the playoffs, the Celtics fell to the Philadelphia 76ers in the Eastern Conference Finals.[55] After the season, Auerbach completed one of the most lopsided trades in NBA history, garnering a pair of future Hall of Famers for a pair of first-round draft picks. Seeking to improve the team immediately, Auerbach sent the team's two first-round draft picks to the Golden State Warriors for both center Robert Parish[56] and the Warriors' first-round pick. He then used the pick the Celtics obtained from Golden State to select University of Minnesota power forward Kevin McHale.[57] The \"Big Three\" of Bird, McHale and Parish played together for the Celtics until 1992, won three NBA championships together,[58] and were later described as the best NBA frontcourt of all time.[59][60][61][62] Despite losing center Dave Cowens to retirement late in training camp, the Celtics went 62–20 under coach Bill Fitch in 1980–81.[63] Once again, the Celtics faced the 76ers in the Eastern Conference Finals, falling behind 3–1 before coming back to win Game Seven, 91–90. The Celtics went on to win the 1981 NBA championship over the Houston Rockets,[64] with Maxwell being named NBA Finals MVP.[65] Following the 1981–82 season, the Celtics once again met the 76ers in the playoffs. This time, they lost in seven games.[66] In 1983 the Celtics were swept in the playoffs (a first for the franchise) by the Milwaukee Bucks;[67] afterwards, Fitch resigned and the team was sold to new owners led by Don Gaston.[68] In 1983–84, the Celtics under new coach K. C. Jones would go 62–20 and return to the NBA Finals after a three-year hiatus.[69] Boston came back from a 2–1 deficit to defeat the Lakers for their 15th championship.[70] Bird renewed his college rivalry with Lakers star Magic Johnson during this series. After the season, Auerbach officially retired as general manager, but maintained the position of team president.[71] He was succeeded by Jan Volk.[71] In 1985, the Lakers and Celtics met again in the Finals, with the Lakers winning.[72] This was the first time the Lakers had defeated the Celtics in the Finals and the only time the team had won a championship at Boston Garden. During the following off-season, the Celtics acquired Bill Walton from the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for Cedric Maxwell.[73] Walton had been an All-Star and league MVP while leading the Portland Trail Blazers to the 1977 NBA championship, but injuries had hobbled him since. Considered the best passing center in NBA history, he stayed healthy and was a big part of the Celtics' success in 1986. The Celtics won the second pick in the 1986 NBA draft and drafted University of Maryland star Len Bias, one of the most heralded prospects of his era.[74] Bias died 36 hours later of an accidental cocaine overdose.[75] Despite the tragedy, the Celtics remained competitive in 1986–87, going 59–23 and again winning the Eastern Conference Championship.[76] They were defeated in the Finals by the Lakers in six games. In 1988, the Celtics lost in six games to the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals.[77] Following the season, head coach K.C. Jones retired and was replaced by assistant Jimmy Rodgers. Boston's hopes for 1988–89 faded when Bird underwent a procedure to remove bone spurs in his feet early in the season, and the Celtics won just 42 games before a first-round playoff defeat to the Pistons. Bird returned in 1989–90 and led the Celtics to a 52–30 record. In the playoffs, the Celtics collapsed after winning the first two games in a best-of-five series against the New York Knicks, losing three straight games and the series. After the playoffs, Rodgers was fired and replaced by assistant coach and former Celtics player Chris Ford. Under Ford's leadership, the Celtics improved to 56–26 in 1990–91, recapturing the Atlantic Division title even though Bird missed 22 games with several injuries. The Celtics again lost to the Pistons in the playoffs. In 1992, a late-season rally allowed a 51–31 Celtics team to catch the New York Knicks and repeat as Atlantic Division champions. After sweeping the Indiana Pacers in the first round, the Celtics lost a seven-game Eastern Conference Semifinals series to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Back injuries limited Bird to only 45 regular season games, and just four of ten in the playoffs. After thirteen NBA seasons and a gold medal at the Barcelona Olympics with the Dream Team, continued back trouble led Bird to retire in 1992. The loss of Bird and the aging of the team's other veteran stars forced coach Chris Ford into rebuilding mode.[78] Hopes centered on 26-year-old Reggie Lewis, a small forward out of Boston's Northeastern University. In the first round of the 1993 playoffs Lewis fainted during Boston's four-game series loss by the Charlotte Hornets.[79] An examination revealed heart problems,[80] but Lewis was able to get doctors to clear him for a comeback. Before he could make it he died of a heart attack while shooting baskets at Brandeis University during the off-season.[81] The Celtics honored his memory by retiring his number 35.[82] With McHale having retired after the Celtics' playoff loss to the Hornets, Boston's original Big 3 era came to an end in 1994 upon Robert Parish's signing with Charlotte.[56] The team collapsed, finishing out of the playoffs with a 32–50 mark. In 1994, the Celtics hired former player and legendary towel-waving cheerleader M. L. Carr as the team's new vice president of basketball operations. Working alongside general manager Jan Volk, Carr selected University of North Carolina star Eric Montross with Boston's first-round pick in the 1994 NBA draft. Montross became the new heir apparent in the paint, but failed to develop and was eventually traded. 1994–95 was the Celtics' final season in the Boston Garden. The Celtics signed aging Dominique Wilkins as a free agent, who led the team in scoring with 17.8 PPG. Second-year player Dino Rađa, a power forward from Croatia, added an interior presence the team had been lacking in 1993–94. The Celtics made the playoffs, losing to the heavily favored Orlando Magic in four games. In 1995, the Celtics moved from the Boston Garden to the Fleet Center (later TD BankNorth, then TD Garden). Carr fired Chris Ford and took the coaching reins himself. After drafting Providence College star Eric Williams, the Celtics struggled to a 33–49 record. Things got worse in 1996–97 as the Celtics lost a franchise-record 67 games, setting an unwanted NBA record winning only once against other Atlantic Division teams and just fifteen victories overall. In spite of the emergence of 1st-round draft pick Antoine Walker, Carr resigned after the season ended, while Rick Pitino was hired to join the franchise as the team's president, director of basketball operations, and head coach, reportedly on a $70 million ten-year contract. Volk resigned on May 7, 1997.[83][84] Pitino's appointment as team president was controversial as Auerbach, the incumbent who had filled that role for more than 25 years, first heard about the change from local media. Unfortunately for the franchise, Pitino was not the savior everyone hoped he would be. Auerbach bore the insult of being elbowed out with dignity, even as the team failed to improve. The Celtics received the third and sixth draft picks in the 1997 NBA draft,[85] and used the picks to select a brand new backcourt through Chauncey Billups and Ron Mercer. The young team that lost 67 games the year before was dismantled, with David Wesley, Dino Rađa and Rick Fox being let go, and Williams traded to the Denver Nuggets for a pair of second round draft picks (Williams would return to the Celtics in 1999 and played for four years). Walter McCarty was also acquired in a trade with the Knicks. With a promising start, upsetting the defending champions Chicago Bulls at home on opening night,[86] and hard play from the youngsters that led to leaderships in turnovers and steals, the team improved its victories from 15 to 36 despite many losing streaks.[87][88] Billups was subsequently traded to the Raptors during his rookie year,[89] and Mercer was traded to the Nuggets during his third season.[90] The following year in the 1998 NBA draft, the Celtics drafted Paul Pierce,[91] a college star who had been expected to be drafted much earlier than the Celtics' 10th overall pick. Pierce had an immediate impact during the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, averaging 19.5 points and being named Rookie of The Month in February as he led the league in steals.[92] However, the Celtics continued to struggle as Pitino failed to achieve meaningful success. After Boston lost to the Toronto Raptors on March 1, 2000, on a buzzer-beater by Vince Carter, Pitino delivered the memorable \"walking through that door\" speech, invoking Bird, McHale and Parish, which has been frequently cited over the years as a reality check for organizations wrestling with bygone glory.[93] He resigned in January 2001.[94] Following the resignation of Rick Pitino, the Celtics saw modest improvement under coach Jim O'Brien. Paul Pierce matured into an NBA star and was ably complemented by Antoine Walker and the other players acquired over the years. While the team was 12–21 when Pitino left, O'Brien's record to finish the season was 24–24.[95] Following the 2000–01 season O'Brien was given the job of head coach on a permanent basis. As a result of numerous trades, the Celtics had three picks in the 2001 NBA draft. They selected Joe Johnson, Joe Forte, and Kedrick Brown. Only Johnson managed to succeed in the NBA, becoming a perennial All-Star after leaving the Celtics. The Celtics entered the 2001–02 season with low expectations. The team's success in the latter stages of 2000–01 was largely forgotten, and critics were surprised when the team, along with the New Jersey Nets, surged to the top of the Atlantic Division ahead of the Philadelphia 76ers, who were fresh off a trip to the NBA Finals. The Celtics won a hard-fought 5-game series with the 76ers in the first round, 3–2. Pierce scored 46 points in the series-clinching game at the Fleet Center. In the Conference Semifinals, the Celtics defeated the favored Detroit Pistons 4–1. In their first trip to the Eastern Conference Finals since 1988, the Celtics jumped out to a 2–1 series lead over the Nets, after rallying from 21 points down in the fourth quarter to win Game 3, but would lose the next three games to fall 4–2.[96] In 2003, the Celtics were sold by owner Paul Gaston to Boston Basketball Partners L.L.C.,[97] led by H. Irving Grousbeck, Wycliffe Grousbeck and Steve Pagliuca. The team made it back to the playoffs but were swept by the Nets in the second round, despite bringing Game 4 to double overtime.[98] Before their elimination, the team hired former Celtics' guard Danny Ainge as general manager, moving Chris Wallace to another position in the organization. Ainge believed the team had reached its peak and promptly sent Antoine Walker to the Dallas Mavericks (along with Tony Delk).[99] In return, the Celtics received the often-injured Raef LaFrentz, Chris Mills, Jiří Welsch,[100] and a first-round pick in 2004. The Celtics made the playoffs, only to be swept in the first round by the Indiana Pacers, losing all four games.[101] The Celtics were a young team under new coach Doc Rivers during the 2004–05 season,[102] having drafted youngsters Al Jefferson, Delonte West and Tony Allen in the 2004 Draft. Yet they seemed to have a core of good young players, led by Pierce and rookie Al Jefferson, to go along with a group of able veterans. The Celtics went 45–37 and won their first Atlantic Division title since 1991–92, receiving a boost from returning star Antoine Walker in mid-season. The Pacers defeated them in the first round yet again, with the series culminating in an embarrassing 27-point loss in Game 7 at the Fleet Center. After the season Walker was traded again, this time to the Miami Heat. Despite Pierce's career season, in which he averaged career-highs in points (26.8), the Celtics missed the playoffs with a 33–49 record, owing largely to a young roster and constant roster shuffling, which saw the likes of Marcus Banks, Ricky Davis and Mark Blount traded for underachieving former first-overall pick Michael Olowokandi and former all-star Wally Szczerbiak. The Celtics continued to rebuild in the 2006 NBA draft. The Celtics selected Kentucky point guard Rajon Rondo, who was to become a key piece in the team's revival. In the second round the Celtics added center Leon Powe.[103] The 2006–07 season was a gloomy one for the franchise, starting with the death of Red Auerbach at 89. Auerbach was one of the few remaining people who had been a part of the NBA since its inception in 1946.[104] The Celtics went 2–22 from late December 2006 through early February 2007 after losing Pierce to injury, the result of a stress reaction in his left foot. At first, the Celtics received a much-needed boost from guard Tony Allen but he tore his ACL and MCL on a needless dunk attempt after the whistle.[105] The Celtics compiled a record of 24–58, second-worst in the NBA, including a franchise-record 18-game losing streak.[106] At the end of the season, the Celtics, with the second-worst record in the NBA, were at least hopeful that they could secure a high draft pick and select either Greg Oden or Kevin Durant to help rebuild the franchise, but the Celtics fell to fifth in the Draft Lottery. In the summer of 2007, general manager Danny Ainge made a series of moves that returned the Celtics to prominence. On draft night, he traded No. 5 pick Jeff Green, Wally Szczerbiak and Delonte West to Seattle for perennial All-Star Ray Allen and Seattle's second-round pick, which the team used to select LSU's Glen \"Big Baby\" Davis.[107] The Celtics then traded Ryan Gomes, Gerald Green, Al Jefferson, Theo Ratliff, Sebastian Telfair, and a first-round draft pick to the Timberwolves in exchange for superstar power forward Kevin Garnett.[108] These moves created a new \"Big Three\" of Pierce, Allen, and Garnett. In the 2007–08 season, Celtics completed the largest single-season turnaround in NBA history. The team went 66–16 in the regular season, a 42-game improvement over its 2006–07 record. However, the team struggled in the early rounds of the playoffs, needing seven games to defeat the Atlanta Hawks in the first round and another seven to defeat the Cleveland Cavaliers in the conference semifinals. The Celtics then beat the Detroit Pistons in six games in the Eastern Conference Finals, winning two road games.[109] For the 11th time in league history, and for the first time since 1987, the Celtics and the Lakers faced off in the NBA Finals. The Celtics won Game One at home 98–88, fueled by strong play by Garnett and Pierce's dramatic comeback from a second-half knee injury. They won Game Two 108–102 despite nearly blowing a 24-point lead in the fourth quarter. As the series shifted to Los Angeles, the Lakers stifled Pierce and Garnett in Game Three and won 87–81. However, the Celtics would overcome a 24-point deficit in Game 4 to win 97–91, making the largest in-game comeback in NBA Finals history. After again blowing a large lead, the Lakers hung on to win Game 5 103–98, sending the series back to Boston. In Game 6, the Celtics overpowered the Lakers, winning 131–92 and clinching their 17th NBA title. Paul Pierce was named Finals MVP.[110] With the win the Celtics set a record for most games a team had ever played in a postseason with 26.[111] The 2008–09 Celtics started off the season at 27–2, the then-best starting record in NBA history.[112] They also had a franchise-record 19-game streak.[113] After the All-Star Break, Kevin Garnett was injured in a loss against the Utah Jazz and missed the last 25 games of the season. Garnett was eventually shelved for the playoffs. The 2009 Celtics still finished with 62 victories, but their playoff run would end against the Magic in the second round.[114] In 2009, with the return of Garnett from injury and the additions of Rasheed Wallace and Marquis Daniels, the Celtics started the season 23–5 and at one point had the best record in the NBA. However, Doc Rivers decided to lessen his aging stars' minutes to keep them fresh for the playoffs. As a result, the Celtics sputtered to an even 27–27 record the rest of the way and finished the 2009–10 regular season with a 50–32 record.[115] Despite being the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference, the Celtics managed to make the NBA Finals. Rajon Rondo emerged as a star during postseason play.[116] For the 12th time, the Celtics faced the Lakers in the Finals. After taking a 3–2 lead heading into Los Angeles for Game Six, the Celtics appeared poised to win their 18th title. However, starting center Kendrick Perkins suffered a severe knee injury early in Game Six,[117] and the Celtics went on to lose the series in seven games. During the 2010 off-season, with Perkins expected to be out until February 2011, the Celtics signed two former All-Star centers, Shaquille O'Neal and Jermaine O'Neal. Shaquille O'Neal's presence wound up leading to Perkins' departure: the Celtics were 33–10 in games Perkins had missed during the year due to injury[118] and had a 19–3 record in games when O'Neal played over 20 minutes.[119] Consequently, Perkins was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder in February, when the Celtics were 41–14 and led the Eastern Conference despite another rash of injuries. Following the trade, however, they proceeded to win only 15 of their final 27 games. They finished with a 56–26 record, sliding to the third seed.[118][120] The 2010–11 season still provided three landmarks: The Celtics became the second team to reach 3,000 victories, Paul Pierce became the third Celtic to score 20,000 points (the others are Larry Bird and John Havlicek), and Ray Allen broke the NBA record for most career three-pointers. The 2011 NBA playoffs started with the Celtics sweeping the New York Knicks 4–0 in the opening round. In the second round, they were ousted by eventual Eastern Conference champions Miami Heat in five games. Shaquille O'Neal, limited to 12 minutes in two games of the second round, retired at the end of the season.[121] The Celtics started the lockout-shortened season 0–3, as Pierce was out with a heel injury. At the All-Star break, the Celtics were below .500 with a 15–17 record. However, they were one of the hottest teams in the league after the break, going 24–10 the rest of the year and winning their fifth division title in a row. The Celtics made the playoffs as the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference. In the playoffs, the Celtics faced the Atlanta Hawks in the first round, beating them in six games led by strong play from Pierce and Garnett. In the conference semifinals, the Celtics defeated the 76ers in seven games. The Celtics faced the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals, losing in seven games to the eventual NBA champions. The 2012 off-season started with the Celtics having only six players under contract. While Kevin Garnett was signed to a new contract, Ray Allen signed with the Miami Heat for less money than the Celtics offered; this move brought the five-year \"Big Three\" era to a somewhat acrimonious end. The Celtics finished the season with 41 wins.[122] The Celtics trailed the New York Knicks 3–0 in the first round of the 2013 NBA playoffs before losing the series in six games. In Game Six, the Celtics nearly completed a comeback when they went on a 20–0 run to cut the lead to four.[123] During the off-season, head coach Doc Rivers was allowed to terminate his contract. He departed the Celtics to coach the Los Angeles Clippers, and the Celtics received a 2015 unprotected first-round pick as compensation. A few days later, Pierce, Garnett (who waived a no-trade clause), Jason Terry, and D. J. White, were traded to the Brooklyn Nets for Keith Bogans, MarShon Brooks, Kris Humphries, Kris Joseph, Gerald Wallace, and three future first-round draft picks (2014, 2016, 2018), together with the right to swap 2017 first-round picks with Brooklyn.[124] The deal marked the start of a youth movement for the team.[125] On July 3, 2013, the Celtics announced that Brad Stevens, the head coach of Butler University, would replace Doc Rivers as head coach.[126] Halfway through the season, in January, Rajon Rondo made his return and was named the 15th Team Captain in team history, and the team furthered the youth movement by acquiring two draft picks in a three-team trade that sent Jordan Crawford and MarShon Brooks to the Golden State Warriors while the Celtics received the Heat center Joel Anthony. The 2013–14 season marked the Celtics' first missed playoffs since the \"Big Three\".[127] The next off-season, the Celtics drafted Marcus Smart with the 6th overall pick and James Young with the 17th overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft,[128] and signed Evan Turner. The 2014–15 season had several roster moves, the most prominent being Rondo and rookie Dwight Powell traded to the Dallas Mavericks for center Brandan Wright, forward Jae Crowder, veteran point guard Jameer Nelson, and future picks.[129] A total of 22 players spent time with the Celtics,[130] leading scorer and rebounder Sullinger suffered a season-ending left metatarsal stress fracture,[131] and the team was only tenth in the East with 28 games remaining.[132] However, midseason acquisition Isaiah Thomas helped the team win 22 of their last 34 games, finishing the season with a 40–42 record, enough for the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference Playoffs.[133] The Celtics were swept by the second seeded Cleveland Cavaliers in the first round. In the 2015 NBA draft Boston selected Terry Rozier, R.J. Hunter, Jordan Mickey, and Marcus Thornton with the 16th, 28th, 33rd, and 45th selections respectively. During the off-season, the Celtics signed forward Amir Johnson and traded Gerald Wallace and Chris Babb in exchange for Warriors forward David Lee. The Celtics finished the 2015–16 NBA season with a 48–34 record, earning the fifth seed in the Eastern Conference. They played the fourth seed Atlanta Hawks in the first round of the playoffs. After leading by 3 points in the fourth quarter of Game 1, guard Avery Bradley went down with a hamstring injury, making him sit out for the rest of the series. The Celtics lost the series 4–2 to the Hawks, ending their season. In the 2016 NBA draft, the Celtics selected Jaylen Brown with the third pick. On July 8, 2016, the team signed four-time All-Star Al Horford.[134] The Celtics finished the 2016–17 season with a 53–29 record and clinched the top seed in the Eastern Conference.[135] After a hip injury ended Thomas' playoff run in game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals,[136] the Celtics eventually lost to the Cavaliers in five games. Isaiah Thomas was selected for his second straight All-Star game and first All-NBA selection, finishing third in the league in scoring and fifth in MVP voting. For the 2017 NBA draft, the Celtics won the draft lottery, earning them the first pick.[b] They were projected to select freshman guard Markelle Fultz, but the pick was subsequently traded to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for the third pick in the 2017 draft and future picks.[137] The 76ers would go on to draft Fultz, while the Celtics used the third pick to select freshman forward Jayson Tatum. During the off-season, the team signed Gordon Hayward.[138] On August 22, 2017, the Celtics agreed to a deal that sent Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, Ante Žižić, and the Brooklyn Nets' 2018 first-round draft pick to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Kyrie Irving.[139] By the end of the off-season, only four Celtics' players remained from the 2016–17 team,[140] with Marcus Smart being the longest-tenured Celtic from the 2014 NBA draft. On the team's opening night game in the first quarter against the Cavaliers, Hayward suffered a fractured tibia and dislocated ankle in his left leg,[141] causing him to be ruled out for the rest of the regular season.[142] Despite the loss, the Celtics went on a 16-game winning streak, which also went down as the fourth-longest winning streak in the teams' history.[143] The Celtics finished the year with a 55–27 record, good enough for second place in the Eastern Conference. In the playoffs, they defeated the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round in seven games, and continued the feat in the Conference Semifinals by defeating the Philadelphia 76ers in five games before losing to the Cleveland Cavaliers in seven games in the Conference Finals. The Celtics finished the 2018–19 season with a 49–33 record. Analysts started questioning the team's performance and chances for the championship when the Celtics had a 10–10 record after the first 20 games on November 24, 2018.[144] The Celtics then won the next eight games improving their record to 18–10.[145] During the eight-game win streak, the Celtics defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 128–95, the New York Knicks 128–100, and also defeated the Chicago Bulls by 56 points (133–77), setting a record for the largest margin in a victory in franchise history, while also tying the record for largest victory margin by an away team.[146] The Celtics finished the regular season in fourth place in the Eastern Conference. During an April 7 game, Marcus Smart injured his hip and was ruled out for the rest of the regular season and the first round of the playoffs.[147] In the 2019 playoffs, the Celtics swept the Indiana Pacers in the first round, and then lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in five games.[148] [149] The Celtics held four picks in the 2019 NBA draft. Following a series of transactions, the team landed Romeo Langford with the 14th pick and also added Grant Williams, Carsen Edwards, and Tremont Waters (2020 G-league Rookie of the year).[150] During the 2019 off-season, Irving and Horford signed with the Brooklyn Nets and Philadelphia 76ers, respectively. Irving left, despite promising to stay in Boston.[151] On June 30, 2019, the Celtics and point guard Kemba Walker agreed to a four-year maximum contract worth $141 million. On July 6, 2019, the Celtics officially acquired Walker in a sign and trade with the Charlotte Hornets; the Celtics sent guard Terry Rozier and a protected 2020 second-round draft pick to Charlotte in exchange for Walker and a 2020 second-round draft pick.[152] On July 1, 2019, the Celtics agreed to a two-year contract with center Enes Kanter.[153] Following the suspension of the 2019–20 NBA season, the Celtics were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final 8 games of the regular season.[154] In the 2020 playoffs, the Celtics swept the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round, beat the Toronto Raptors in a seven-game series, and fell to the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals in six games.[155] Boston struggled with injuries in the 2020–21 season, with Walker, Tatum and Brown all missing games at different points in the season due to injury and COVID-19. Boston could not automatically qualify for the playoffs and were sent to the play-in tournament, where they defeated the Washington Wizards 119–100. In the playoffs, they lost to the Brooklyn Nets in five games.[156] On June 2, 2021, the Celtics named head coach Brad Stevens as president of basketball operations replacing Danny Ainge after he announced his retirement.[157] On June 18, Stevens made his first transaction in his new position trading away Kemba Walker, the 16th pick in the 2021 NBA draft, and a 2025 second-round pick in exchange for former Celtic Horford, Moses Brown, and a 2023 second-round pick.[158] On June 23, 2021, it was reported that Stevens had made the decision to hire Ime Udoka as his own replacement as head coach of the Celtics.[159][160] Tatum made his third All-Star appearance off the bench at the 2022 NBA All-Star Game in Cleveland. In April 2022, the Celtics qualified for the 2022 NBA playoffs as the second seed in the Eastern Conference, having a 51–31 record; they swept the Brooklyn Nets in the first round of the postseason.[161] They next faced the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Conference Semifinals and the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals, defeating both teams in seven-game series, earning the Celtics their first Finals appearance since 2010. The Celtics took a 2–1 series lead, but lost the next three games to lose to the Golden State Warriors 4–2.[162] In September, the Celtics suspended Udoka for the whole 2022–23 season for engaging in an improper intimate relationship with a female staffer.[163] Assistant coach Joe Mazzulla replaced Udoka as the interim head coach.[164] On February 16, 2023, Mazzulla was named the team's permanent head coach after leading the Celtics to a league-best 42–17 record at the NBA All-Star break.[165] After overcoming a 3–2 deficit against the Philadelphia 76ers to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals, the Celtics fell behind 3–0 in a rematch against the Heat. They battled their way back to Game 7 thanks to a Derrick White buzzer-beater in Game 6, but the Heat ultimately prevented the first 3–0 comeback in NBA history with a decisive win in Boston. During the 2023 off-season, the Celtics acquired Kristaps Porziņģis from the Wizards. In the trade, they sent Marcus Smart to the Memphis Grizzlies in a three-team deal,[166] and also traded Grant Williams to the Dallas Mavericks.[167] On October 1, 2023, the Celtics acquired Jrue Holiday in exchange for Malcolm Brogdon, Robert Williams III and two draft picks.[168] On February 7, 2024, before the trade deadline, the Celtics acquired Xavier Tillman from the Grizzlies.[169] The Celtics finished the 2023–24 regular season with the best record in the NBA, securing a 64–18 record.[170] After the regular season's close, the Celtics entered the 2024 NBA playoffs, defeating the Miami Heat in the first round, moving on to defeat the Cleveland Cavaliers in the East Semifinals, and moving on again to defeat the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals.[171][172][173] The Celtics' victory in the Eastern Conference Finals on May 27, 2024, was accompanied by the announcement that Jaylen Brown had been selected as the NBA Eastern Conference Finals MVP, and Brown was presented with the Larry Bird trophy, the first of his career.[174][175] The Celtics would go on to defeat the Dallas Mavericks in five games to win the NBA Finals, their record-setting 18th championship and breaking the tie with the Lakers (who have 17).[176] The rivalry between the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers involves the two most storied franchises in NBA history. It has been called the NBA's best rivalry.[177] The two teams have met a record twelve times in the NBA Finals, starting with their first Finals meeting in 1959. They would go on to dominate the league in the 1960s and the 1980s, facing each other six times in the 1960s, three times in the 1980s, in 2008, and in 2010. The Celtics have won the first eight finals meetings, while the Lakers won three of last four. The rivalry had been less intense since the retirements of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird in the early 1990s, but in 2008 it was renewed as the Celtics and Lakers met in the Finals for the first time since 1987, with the Celtics winning the series in six games. They faced off once again in the 2010 NBA Finals which the Lakers won in seven games. The two teams are first and second for the highest number of championships, with the Celtics leading the Lakers, 18 titles to 17; together, their 35 championships account for almost half of the 78 championships in NBA history. The Celtics–Hawks rivalry is a rivalry in the Eastern Conference of the National Basketball Association that has lasted for over five decades, although the two teams have played each other since the 1949–50 season, when the then-Tri-Cities Blackhawks joined the NBA as part of the National Basketball League and the Basketball Association of America merger. However, the Blackhawks could not field a truly competitive team until they moved to St. Louis as the St. Louis Hawks after a four-year stopover at Milwaukee. The two teams have faced each other eleven times in the NBA Playoffs, four times in the NBA Finals, with the Celtics winning ten of twelve series against the Hawks, including three out of four NBA Finals.[178] While the Hawks have only defeated the Celtics twice out of eleven series in the NBA Playoffs, they still often managed to make their series with the Celtics memorable. The rivalry intensified in 2016 with Hawks All-Star Center Al Horford spurning the team and joining the Celtics. The Boston Celtics were once rivals of the New Jersey Nets during the early 2000s due to their respective locations and their burgeoning stars. The Nets were led by Jason Kidd and Kenyon Martin, while the Celtics were experiencing newfound success behind Paul Pierce and Antoine Walker. The rivalry began to heat up in the 2002 Eastern Conference Finals, which was preceded by trash-talking from the Celtics[179] who claimed Martin was a \"fake\" tough guy. Things progressed as the series started, and on-court tensions seemed to spill into the stands. Celtics' fans berated Kidd and his family with chants of \"Wife Beater!\"[180] in response to Kidd's 2001 domestic abuse charge. When asked about the fan barbs being traded, Kenyon Martin stated, \"Our fans hate them, their fans hate us.\" Bill Walton said at the time that Nets-Celtics was the \"beginning of the next great NBA rivalry\" during the Eastern Conference Finals in 2002 with the Nets advancing to the NBA Finals, though New Jersey would go on to sweep Boston in the 2003 playoffs. In 2012, the year the Nets returned to New York in the borough of Brooklyn, there were indications that the rivalry might be rekindled when an altercation occurred on the court on November 28, resulting in the ejection of Rajon Rondo, Gerald Wallace, and Kris Humphries. Rondo was suspended for two games in the aftermath, while Wallace and Kevin Garnett were fined.[181] The story was revisited on December 25, when Wallace grabbed Garnett's shorts and the two had to be broken up by referees and players alike. However, the rivalry between the Nets and the Celtics appeared significantly cooled off by the June 2013 blockbuster trade that dealt Celtics stars Garnett and Paul Pierce to the Nets in exchange for Wallace, Humphries, and others. This move was billed as a merger of the two Atlantic Division teams.[182] The rivalry between the Celtics and the Detroit Pistons peaked in the 1980s, featuring players such as Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, Robert Parish, Isiah Thomas, Bill Laimbeer, Dennis Rodman, and Joe Dumars. These teams met in the NBA playoffs five times in 7 seasons from 1985 to 1991, with the Celtics winning in 1985 and 1987, and the Pistons coming out on top en route to back-to-back Finals appearances in 1988 and their championship seasons of 1989 and 1990. Led by Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen in the 2008 Eastern Conference Finals the Celtics defeated the Pistons in 6 games to advance to the NBA Finals where they went on to beat the Lakers also in 6 games.[183] The rivalry between the Celtics and the New York Knicks stems from the location of the teams, both of which are in the NBA's Atlantic division. It is one of many rivalries between Boston and New York teams, most notably the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox in Major League Baseball. Boston and New York are also the only two original NBA franchises that have remained in the same city for the duration of their existence. The teams have played 512 games against each other during the regular season, with the Celtics winning 276 times. The two teams have also faced each other 61 times during the playoffs, with the Celtics winning 34 times.[184] The Celtics and the Philadelphia 76ers are the two teams who have the most meetings in the NBA playoffs, playing each other in 22 series, of which the Celtics have won 15.[185] The 76ers are considered the Celtics' biggest rival in the Eastern Conference. The rivalry reached its peak when players Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain of the 76ers played each other from 1965 to 1968. Their play would result in the Celtics not winning every NBA Finals series in the 1960s when the 76ers won in 1967.[186] One of the most recent and unexpected rivalries that has been created between the Celtics is with the Washington Wizards. Although both teams had engaged in a fight in 1984,[187] the rivalry intensified during the 2015–16 season in a January regular season game after Jae Crowder was given a technical foul. Crowder then began to exchange words with then Wizards coach Randy Wittman. It began to escalate that off-season when the Celtics were trying to sign Al Horford. It was publicly reported that Jae Crowder emphasized that the Celtics beat the Wizards in all of their meetings that season and should sign with them rather than Washington. In their first meeting of the 2016–17 season, Wall hit Marcus Smart in the back-court when they were up by 20 late in the 4th quarter. Wall was hit with a Flagrant 2 foul and was promptly ejected. Smart immediately got back up and began to scuffle with Wall. Their words continued even after being separated with Wall telling Smart to meet him out back after the game. No incident was reported between the two following the game. In their next meeting, the Celtics won 117–108. However, after the game Wall and Crowder exchanged words in front of the Wizards bench. Crowder ended up trying to jab his finger at Wall's nose and Wall tried to fight back with a slap. Teammates and coaches from both sides had to step in and separate the two teams but the players continued to yell while entering their respective locker rooms. Police officers had to be on guard between the two locker rooms to ensure no further confrontation. Otto Porter is quoted as calling the Celtics as dirty. Isaiah Thomas replied \"If playing hard is dirty, then I guess we are a dirty team.\"[188] In their next game in January, the Wizards wore all black to enter the game. The notion was that it is similar to the attire of a funeral. Their decision worked as they defeated the Celtics 123–108. The two teams would go on to meet in the Conference Semifinals in the 2017 Playoffs. In Game 1, Markieff Morris landed on Horford's ankle after shooting a jumpshot. Morris sprained his ankle and had to miss the rest of the game which was a 123–111 loss. Morris believed that Horford did this intentionally. In Game 2, Morris retaliated by grabbing Horford by the waist and pushed him into the seats.[189] In Game 3, Kelly Olynyk set a hard screen on Kelly Oubre. Olynyk's shoulder hit Oubre in the chin causing him to drop to the floor. Oubre angrily rose and pushed Olynyk down onto the floor. Oubre was then assessed a flagrant 2 foul and was ejected while also being suspended for Game 4.[190] No significant altercations erupted in the rest of the seven-game series in which the Celtics would go on to win. The rivalry has since dissipated as the Celtics have retooled their roster but their match-ups are still seen as significant as they played on Christmas in 2017. The Boston Celtics and the Miami Heat developed an intense rivalry during the 2010s. The two teams were highlighted by their star trios in Boston's Ray Allen, Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce whereas Miami had LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. They first met in the 2010 NBA Playoffs where Boston won the series in 5 games. They would then meet the following year where Miami would end up winning in 5 games. The teams would meet for the third straight year in the 2012 Eastern Conference Finals. Despite Boston holding a 3–2 lead, Miami would win the next 2 games to advance to the NBA Finals where they defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder. In the 2020 NBA Bubble, the Miami Heat and Boston Celtics met in the 2020 Eastern Conference Finals where Miami won in 6 games and advanced to the NBA Finals where they were prevented Boston from meeting their longtime rival Los Angeles Lakers. Unfortunately, Miami lost in 6 games to the Los Angeles Lakers. They would meet in the 2022 Eastern Conference Finals where Boston finally beat the Miami Heat in 7 games. It was their first win against Miami since 2010. In the following year, the two met in the 2023 Eastern Conference Finals. Despite Miami taking a commanding a 3–0 lead, Boston won the next three games to send the series to 7 games. However, Miami won to avoid earning the distinction of blowing a 3–0 lead. They then met in the 2024 first round where Boston beat Miami in 5 games. List of the last five seasons completed by the Celtics. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Boston Celtics seasons. Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W–L% = Winning percentage The Celtics have won an NBA-record 18 championships.[191] Forty-eight members of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame are connected to the Celtics,[192] and the franchise has retired 23 jersey numbers, more than any other American sports team.[193] As of December 2023, the Celtics have won more NBA regular season games than any other team.[194] 37 people were inducted in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as players, 6 – as coaches, 6 – as contributors.[195] Additionally, Johnny Most and Mike Gorman were honored with the Hall of Fame's Curt Gowdy Media Award. Most was awarded in 1993 for his 37-year career as the Celtics radio announcer, while Gorman was awarded in 2021 for his 40-year career as the Celtics television announcer. Notes: FIBA, the body which governs international basketball, has selected two players associated with the Celtics to the FIBA Hall of Fame for contributions to international basketball. Roster Last transaction: December 26, 2024 The Celtics hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player is ostensibly either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.[196] This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. Bold denotes still active with the team. Italic denotes still active but not with the team. Points scored (regular season) (as of the end of the 2023–24 season)[217] Other statistics (regular season) (as of the end of the 2023–24 season)[217] There have been 18 head coaches in Celtics' history. Red Auerbach is the most successful franchise's head coach having won 9 NBA championships with the team. Celtics' legend Bill Russell took coaching duties from Auerbach and led them to 2 NBA championships while playing and coaching at the same time. The other two coaches that won 2 NBA titles with the team are Tom Heinsohn and K. C. Jones. Bill Fitch and Doc Rivers led the Celtics to 1 NBA championship apiece, as has current head coach Joe Mazzulla.[218] The Boston Celtics logo features a leprechaun spinning a basketball, named Lucky, originally depicted with a large basketball for a background. It was originally designed by Zang Auerbach, the brother of Celtics head coach Red Auerbach.[219] Through the 1995–96 season, the logo's only colors were green, white and black.[220] Then for the 1996–97 season, celebrating the club's 50th anniversary, the logo got a full-color treatment. Lucky's face and hands were both painted tan, while gold was included on the vest, bow tie and hat, as well as brown on the ball and shillelagh, and black on its pants and shoes.[221] The Celtics also have various alternative logos, with the most popular being a white shamrock with the letters \"Celtics\" above it, wrapped in a green circle, which has been used since the 1998–99 season. The alternate logo is based on logos used by the Celtics before they used the Zang Auerbach leprechaun. For much of its history, the shamrock was trimmed in gold, as seen in the old team warmup jackets. A new secondary logo, unveiled in 2014, featured a variation of the leprechaun logo, in silhouette form.[5][222] For much of their history, the Celtics wore green uniforms on the road and white uniforms at home. The basic template of the current Celtics' uniforms was formalized in the team's early years, and along the way they made a few adjustments in the lettering and stripes.[223] Among the more notable changes in the uniforms were the switch from serifed to sans-serif block lettering in 1968, the addition of names in 1972, and the incorporation of the three-leaf shamrock logo in 1998. While the white uniforms remained largely intact, the green uniforms have featured either the city name (1950s–1965; 2014–present) or the team name (1965–2014).[224] When Nike became the NBA's uniform provider in 2017, they decided to eliminate the \"home\" and \"away\" uniform designations. Thus the white Celtics uniforms became known as the \"Association\" uniforms while the green uniforms became the \"Icon\" uniforms. Both sets are now used regardless of home and road games.[4] In January 2017, the Celtics signed a multi-year deal with General Electric where they became the \"exclusive Data and Analytics partner\" for the team. As part of the deal, GE agreed to pay the Celtics more than $7 million per year[225] to have the uniforms with a GE logo prominently placed on the left shoulder of jerseys in green and white. This was the first time a corporate logo were placed on the game uniforms.[226][227] Along with the GE logo, the Nike logo now emblazons the right shoulder of the Celtics' uniforms. In November 2020, the Celtics signed a multi-year deal with Vistaprint who became the main jersey sponsor of the team.[228] In July 2024, Amica Mutual Insurance signed on as the team's jersey sponsor.[7] From 2005 to 2017, the Celtics wore alternate green uniforms with black lettering and trim featuring the word \"Boston\" on the front side. One noticeable difference in the alternate uniforms was the black panels with a green shamrock, reminiscent of the original Celtics uniforms worn in the late 1940s.[229] A gray uniform set was also used from 2014 to 2017. Dubbed \"Parquet Pride\", the uniforms featured sleeves (a prominent figure in Adidas' NBA uniforms), white letters with green trim, the silhouetted leprechaun logo on the shorts, the shamrock logo on the left leg, and a parquet-like pattern on the sides.[230] For 2017 and beyond, the Celtics will wear black \"Statement\" uniforms (labeled by Nike in reference to the league's third jerseys). The uniform features a black base with \"Celtics\" in green lettering and white trim, and other than a few changes in the striping scheme, the uniform remained essentially the same. Starting in 2020, the \"Statement\" uniform would feature the Air Jordan brand logo, a feature previously exclusive to the Charlotte Hornets uniforms.[231] Between 2006 and 2017, the Celtics wore special St. Patrick's Day uniforms. The initial uniforms were worn from 2006 to 2013 and it strongly resembled their regular green uniforms save for gold and white trim and the city name in front.[232] For 2014 and 2015, the uniforms were sleeved, replaced the city name in front in favor of the team name, and now resembled their green/black alternates.[233] In 2016 and 2017, the uniforms were again sleeveless and featured the city name in front, but kept the previous striping. During the NBA Europe Live Tour prior to the 2007–08 season, the Celtics used the alternate road jerseys in their game against the Toronto Raptors in Rome, except that the words \"Boston\" on the front side of the jersey and the shamrock on the shorts and on the reverse side of the jersey contained the green, white and red tricolors of the Italian flag. In the second game in London, the regular road jerseys featured a patch containing the Union Jack. At the 2008–09 season opener against the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Celtics wore a modified version of their home uniforms, accented with gold, to commemorate last season's championship team. The Celtics have also worn special edition Christmas Day uniforms since the 2008–09 season. For the first four games, they wore their regular green uniforms modified with the NBA logo inside a snowflake. Then in the 2012–13 season, they wore monochrome uniforms with green lettering trimmed in white. For the 2016–17 season, the Celtics wore a special green uniform with a more ornate script lettering, but without the additional striping. Starting with the 2017–18 season, the Celtics wore special edition \"City\" uniforms designed by Nike. Their first \"City\" uniforms were in gray and featured a pattern of the parquet floor throughout, a green shamrock with white trim on the left leg, green letters with white trim, Red Auerbach's signature near the uniform tag, and a portion of the 2008 championship banner on the beltline.[234] For the 2018–19 season, the Celtics wore white \"City\" uniforms with green letters and shamrocks trimmed in gold. It also has Red Auerbach's signature near the uniform tag and a gold-trimmed alternate Celtics logo on the beltline.[235][236] In addition, the Celtics wore an \"Earned\" edition uniform exclusive only to the 16 teams that made the 2018 NBA playoffs. Their rendition is a palette swap of the \"City\" uniforms with a green base and gold letters and shamrocks with white trim. Both uniforms were inspired by the team's warmup jackets they wore from the 1950s until 1998, which contained a brighter gold trim.[237] The Celtics' \"City\" uniform for the 2019–20 season featured a green base and a stylized \"Boston\" wordmark and numbers in gold with black trim. A Celtic knot in the shape of a shamrock adorn the beltline.[238] The 2020–21 Celtics' \"City\" uniform was patterned after the 17 championship banners that adorn the TD Garden rafters. The uniform, which is white with thick green stripes, features the full name in Futura Condensed stacked in front, and Red Auerbach's signature and quote \"The Boston Celtics are not a basketball team. They're a way of life.\" appears above the manufacturer's tag.[239] The Celtics also released a second \"Earned\" uniform after qualifying in the 2020 NBA playoffs; this design features a dark green base with Celtic and lime green striping, and the letters were rendered in Celtic green with white trim.[240] The Celtics' green \"City\" uniform for the 2021–22 season was a mix of previous uniform designs. The neck and arm striping was taken from their current uniforms. The green lettering with white drop shadows was a nod to the 1949 uniform design. The gray triangles on the shorts represented the franchise's initial uniforms; the left side contained the team's 75th anniversary emblem, while the right side contained a green-and-white version of the Red Auerbach memorial shamrock used in the 2006–07 season. Contrasting nameplates on the back were inspired by the warmup jackets the team used for much of its history, and the original \"jumping leprechaun\" logo from the 1960s was added to the waist. Retired numbers, the Auerbach signature and quotation (see 2021 \"City\" uniform), and 17 shamrocks representing each championship season, surrounded the jock tag.[241] The 2022–23 \"City\" uniform served as a memorial to Bill Russell, who died on July 31. The uniform is dark green with metallic gold and black accents, and has the \"Celtics\" wordmark inspired by the Slade's Bar & Grill restaurant once owned by Russell. The black stripes contained 11 gold diamonds on each side, commemorating each of Russell's championships, and also featured a grayscale pattern of the parquet floor. The waistband contained Russell's jersey no. 6 surrounded by the 11 gold diamonds.[242] The \"City\" uniform in the 2023–24 season featured a nod to the origins of the game of basketball. The white-based design featured dark green letters and brown trim in reference to traditional maker's marks from Boston's history of furniture makers, along with wood grain accents to reference the peach baskets first used in the game.[243] In another first, the Celtics unveiled an alternate court specific to the 2023 NBA in-season tournament. The design, which is based on the \"City\" uniform, featured a mostly green-painted maple court with a brown strip along the free throw lanes. The silhouette of the NBA Cup is situated along the free throw lanes, and the actual trophy is painted at center court along with the \"BOSTON\" wordmark.[244] For the 2024–25 \"City\" uniform, the Celtics built upon last season's \"City\" uniform and focused on continuous evolution of the game of basketball. The black-based uniform featured \"Action green\" (neon green) letters and striping, along with futuristic-style numbers. [245] During the 2006–07 season, the Celtics wore a commemorative patch of a black shamrock with the nickname \"Red\" in green letters on the right top of the jersey in remembrance of Red Auerbach, who died shortly prior to the beginning of the season.[246] The team has honored deceased members of the Celtics family with a commemorative black band on the left shoulder strap of the jersey. It has been featured thirteen times to date: Walter Brown (1964–65), Bob Schmertz (1975–76), Joan Cohen (1989–90), Johnny Most (1992–93), Reggie Lewis (1993–94), Dorothy Auerbach (2000–01), Dennis Johnson (2006–07),[246] Jim Loscutoff (2015–16), Jo Jo White (2017–18), John Havlicek (2018–19), Tom Heinsohn, and K. C. Jones (both 2020–21), Sam Jones (2021–22), and Bill Walton (2023–24). During the 2019–20 season, the Celtics wore a black band in honor of two people who had never been part of the Celtics organization; former NBA commissioner David Stern and former Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant. The Celtics have also worn a black band for reasons not directly related to the franchise, such as the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, and the death of Isaiah Thomas' younger sister during the 2017 NBA playoffs. In the 2022–23 season, the Celtics joined the rest of the NBA in wearing the black no. 6 patch in memory of Bill Russell.[247] The team also had the tradition of wearing black sneakers through most of their history. According to legend, Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach had a problem with the white sneakers, claiming that the white sneakers can easily get dirty; hence starting a long tradition with the black sneakers. In the early 1970s, the Celtics changed their sneaker color to green, but by 1985, returned to the customary black due to the difficulty of producing the right shade of Celtic green.[248] Prior to the 2003–04 season, then-Celtics general manager Danny Ainge and captain Paul Pierce suggested wearing white sneakers, in due part to a growing number of teams wearing black sneakers. Ainge gladly accepted and the white sneakers have remained since on home games. They still wore the black sneakers on away games, and brought them back for all home games during the 2004 NBA playoffs, and in one home game during the 2005 NBA playoffs. In the 2008–09 season, they wore white sneakers with green and gold accents while wearing their St. Patrick's Day jerseys on the road. Most recently, when the Celtics play on Christmas Day, they wore white or green sneakers with red and gold accents.[249] Since the 2009–10 season, the NBA relaxed its rules on specified sneaker colors, and Celtics players are now seen wearing custom-made and personalized sneakers at home and on the road, although for the most part they wear either green, white or black sneakers. The Celtics were the only team to wear warmup jackets with the player names on the back. During the 1980s, this style was dominant in most NBA warmup jackets, but by the late 1990s, this style gradually declined. The Celtics, however, kept the design in keeping with tradition, before discontinuing the practice after the 2011–12 season in favor of a templated jacket design common to all 30 teams. NBC Sports Boston is the Boston Celtics' main television outlet, having aired its games since 1981 when the station was known as PRISM New England. In 1983, it rebranded as SportsChannel New England. Like all the other SportsChannel networks, the New England channel was rebranded as Fox Sports New England when former owner Cablevision entered into a partnership with Liberty Media and News Corporation in 1998. Comcast purchased Cablevision's original network stake in 2001, then acquired the remaining stake in what was now FSN New England in 2007 and rebranded the network as Comcast SportsNet New England. In 2017, all CSN networks (including CSN New England) were renamed as NBC Sports Regional Networks in reference to Comcast's current ownership of NBCUniversal. As of the 2024–25 season, Drew Carter serves as the television play-by-play announcer with Brian Scalabrine as an analyst. All Celtics games are heard on radio through Beasley Broadcast Group's WBZ-FM (98.5, otherwise branded as \"The Sports Hub\"), with play-by-play from Sean Grande and color commentary from Cedric Maxwell, a deal in place since the 2013–14 season.[250] It is carried on stations in 5 of the 6 New England States via the Boston Celtics Radio Network. Long-time announcers Johnny Most and Mike Gorman have won the Curt Gowdy Media Award for their outstanding work as broadcasters. Most was the team's radio announcer from 1953 to 1990, and Gorman served as the television announcer from 1981 to 2024. *Sale not approved by NBA[254]",

                "content": "Matthew Louis Gaetz II (/ɡeɪts/ GAYTS; born May 7, 1982) is an American politician and lawyer who served as the U.S. representative for Florida's 1st congressional district from 2017 until his resignation in 2024. His district included all of Escambia, Okaloosa, and Santa Rosa counties, and portions of Walton County. A member of the Republican Party and a self-described libertarian populist, Gaetz is widely regarded as a proponent of far-right politics as well as a staunch ally of Donald Trump.[1] In October 2023, Gaetz filed a motion to vacate which led to the removal of Kevin McCarthy as speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. The son of prominent Florida politician Don Gaetz and grandson of North Dakota politician Jerry Gaetz, Gaetz was raised in Fort Walton Beach, Florida. After graduating from William & Mary Law School, he briefly worked in private practice before running for state representative. He served in the Florida House of Representatives from 2010 until 2016, and received national attention for defending Florida's \"stand-your-ground law\". In 2016, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, and was re-elected in 2018, 2020, 2022, and 2024. In 2020, Gaetz was accused of sex trafficking and having sexual relationships with minors. After an investigation, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) decided not to charge him. Prior to his resignation as a representative, Gaetz was being investigated by the House Ethics Committee. In December 2024, the House Ethics Committee released a report which found evidence that Gaetz paid for sex—including with a 17-year-old—and abused illegal drugs during his tenure in the U.S. House of Representatives.[2] On November 13, 2024, president-elect Donald Trump announced he would nominate Gaetz to serve as United States attorney general, which was received badly by some Senate Republicans. Upon Trump's announcement, Gaetz resigned from the House of Representatives. A week later, Gaetz withdrew himself from consideration for the post of attorney general. Though he had already won re-election to the 119th United States Congress, he submitted a letter of resignation prior to the swearing in. Gaetz started hosting a political talk show airing weeknights on One America News Network, airing from January 2025 onwards. Matthew Louis Gaetz II was born on May 7, 1982, in Hollywood, Florida, to Victoria (née Quertermous) and Don Gaetz, who later became a prominent local politician,[3][4][5] earning Matthew Gaetz the nickname \"Baby Gaetz\".[6] He has a younger sister.[7] He grew up in a conservative and religious family near Fort Walton Beach, and graduated from Niceville High School.[8][9] He graduated from Florida State University in 2003 with a Bachelor of Science in interdisciplinary sciences, and from the William & Mary Law School in 2007 with a Juris Doctor.[10][11] Gaetz was admitted to the Florida Bar on February 6, 2008.[12] Gaetz's father represented parts of northwest Florida as a member of the Florida State Senate from 2006 to 2016, was Senate president from 2012 to 2014, and was elected to the Florida Senate again in 2024.[13] Gaetz's grandfather, Jerry Gaetz, was the mayor of Rugby, North Dakota, and a candidate for lieutenant governor of North Dakota at the 1964 North Dakota Republican Party state convention, where he died of a heart attack.[14] After graduating from law school,[15] Gaetz worked at the law firm Keefe, Anchors & Gordon (now AnchorsGordon)[16] in Fort Walton Beach.[7] In October 2021, the Florida bar suspended Gaetz from practicing law due to unpaid fees.[17] He was reinstated after the $265 fee was paid.[18] In March 2010, after Republican state representative Ray Sansom's resignation on corruption charges in February 2010,[19] Gaetz ran in the special election to succeed Sansom in the 4th district, which included southern Santa Rosa County and Okaloosa County.[20] In a crowded Republican primary that included Craig Barker, Kabe Woods, Jerry G. Melvin, and Bill Garvie, Gaetz won with 43 percent of the vote.[20] In the special general election, Gaetz defeated Democratic nominee Jan Fernald with 66 percent of the vote.[21] During his campaign, Gaetz received almost $480,000 in contributions, about five times more than anyone else in the field, and almost 50 times more than Fernald, including $100,000 of his own money.[7] Gaetz was unopposed for a full term in 2010.[22] In 2012, following the reconfiguration of Florida House of Representatives districts, Gaetz's district no longer contained any of Santa Rosa County. He was reelected unopposed in 2012[23] and 2014.[24] While serving in the state house, Gaetz and state senator Joe Negron proposed legislation that would hasten the execution of many inmates on Florida's death row by requiring the governor to sign an execution warrant for those who had exhausted their appeals.[25] He also joined state senator Greg Evers in proposing legislation to eliminate the federal ethanol content mandate that 10 percent of gasoline sold in Florida contain ethanol;[26][27] Governor Rick Scott signed the legislation in May 2013.[28] In 2015, Gaetz was one of two members to vote against a Florida bill which criminalized revenge porn, due to \"personal animosity\". He had successfully blocked the bill previously.[29] Florida House speaker Will Weatherford announced that he would order hearings on the stand-your-ground law.[30] Gaetz, the chairman of the Criminal Justice Subcommittee, was tasked with reviewing the legislation; he announced before hearings that he would not support changing \"one damn comma\", but said he would listen to both sides' testimony.[31][32] After the hearings, he authored legislation to allow defendants who successfully used a stand-your-ground defense during trial to be able to expunge relevant information from their criminal records.[33] When his subcommittee was considering legislation that would keep suspects' mugshots off the Internet until their convictions, Gaetz brought up his 2008 arrest and non-conviction, arguing that his mistakes made him who he is and that publicly available mugshots \"could be a problem for those unaccustomed to publicity\".[34] In 2015, Gaetz supported the presidential campaign of Jeb Bush.[35] Bush emailed Gaetz about introducing a bill to change the 2016 Florida Republican presidential primary to an earlier date in order to benefit Bush, Florida's former governor.[36] Don Gaetz, then the president of the Florida Senate, also endorsed Bush, along with several other members of Florida's state legislature.[37] In 2013, Gaetz announced that, in 2016, he would run for the 1st district State Senate seat held by his father, Don Gaetz, who was term-limited in 2016.[38] On March 21, 2016, Gaetz withdrew from the race, choosing instead to run for the U.S. House seat representing Florida's 1st congressional district; the incumbent, Jeff Miller, had announced 11 days earlier that he would not seek reelection.[39] On August 30, 2016, Gaetz won the Republican primary with 35.7 percent of the vote to Greg Evers's 21.5 percent and Cris Dosev's 20.6 percent, along with five other candidates.[40] This virtually assured Gaetz of victory in the general election; with a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+22, the 1st is Florida's most Republican district, and one of the most Republican in the nation. In the November 8 general election, Gaetz defeated Democratic nominee Steven Specht with 69 percent of the vote.[41] He is only the seventh person to represent this district since 1933 (the district was numbered the 3rd before 1963). Though a financial disclosure form Gaetz filed in 2016 showed a net worth of $388,000, he donated $200,000 of his own money to his congressional campaign. He also resigned from two Florida House political action committees he had started and chaired; the PACs closed down and transferred $380,000 to a federal super PAC, North Florida Neighbors, whose purpose was to support Gaetz's congressional campaign.[7] Following the death of Miami Marlins pitcher José Fernández, Gaetz criticized the athletes protesting during the national anthem in a tweet on September 25, 2016.[42][43] Gaetz was listed as a member of the moderate Republican Main Street Partnership from at least January to June 2017.[44][45][46] Gaetz served as a top campaign adviser to Ron DeSantis during his 2018 gubernatorial campaign. He managed debate preparations and \"drafted early administration organizational charts, helped steer early policy decisions and played a huge role in DeSantis' appointments\", according to Politico.[47] Gaetz hired Darren Beattie as a speechwriter in April 2019. Beattie had previously been fired as a speechwriter for the Trump administration after attending a conference associated with white nationalists.[48] Gaetz attended political rallies in 2018 and 2019 at which members of the Proud Boys were present.[49][50] After the 2020 State of the Union Address, Gaetz filed an ethics complaint against speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, arguing that she had committed a \"flagrant violation of decorum\" and perhaps broken the law by ripping up her copy of the speech.[51] Gaetz announced that he would no longer accept campaign contributions from federal political action committees in February 2020.[52] House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy complained on a January 10, 2021, phone call that Gaetz was unnecessarily \"putting people in jeopardy\", noting that the rioters at the U.S. Capitol on January 6 \"came prepared with rope\". The conversation was reported in April 2022.[53] Gaetz and Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Greene began a nationwide \"America First Tour\" on May 7, 2021, in The Villages, Florida.[54] During the tour, Gaetz and Greene repeated debunked claims of fraud in the 2020 election, attacked Big Tech and, at one event, argued that the Second Amendment was for \"maintaining, within the citizenry, the ability to maintain an armed rebellion against the government, if that becomes necessary.\"[55][56] As a consequence of the controversy the speakers had generated, their appearance at a conference site at Laguna Hills, in Orange County, California, was canceled.[57] Gaetz was one of 21 House Republicans to vote against a resolution to give the Congressional Gold Medal to police officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on January 6 in June 2021.[58] Gaetz invited Corey Ryan Beekman to lead the pledge of allegiance at a Judiciary Committee hearing in February 2023. Beekman was charged with murder in 2019 in Michigan, and the victim's family criticized the invitation.[59][60][61] Gaetz apologized to the family.[62] Republicans regained a narrow House majority in the 2022 midterm elections. Although sitting minority Leader Kevin McCarthy sought the speakership and had the support of 213 members, he needed five more votes to reach a majority to be elected. Certain members of the Freedom Caucus, including Gaetz, could contribute the required margin. Democrats held 212 votes, with one seat unfilled due to the November death of a holdover incumbent. The anti-McCarthy members withheld more than four votes through 14 ballots. They were thought to be holding out for substantial concessions regarding House rules and committee chair assignments. Their withholding of votes prevented McCarthy earning a majority of votes needed for the speakership.[63] Thirteen months earlier, Gaetz had discussed with former president Trump the possibility of getting Trump elected to the speakership, for which House membership is not required.[64] Gaetz nominated him once and voted for Trump on the 7th, 8th and 11th ballots.[65] After midnight, January 7, on the 15th and last ballot, Gaetz switched his vote to \"present\", lowering the number of votes McCarthy needed and allowing him to win the speakership.[66] On October 2, 2023, Gaetz filed a resolution to oust McCarthy from his role as speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives after the latter had negotiated with Democrats to pass a shutdown-averting continuing resolution which did not include fiscally conservative reforms.[67][68] Gaetz's resolution ended up passing by a vote of 216–210.[69] In April 2024, McCarthy accused Gaetz of filing the motion to oust him as a means of protecting himself against allegations of having had sex with a 17-year-old minor.[70][71][72] According to McCarthy, the House ethics committee had been investigating the case since 2021, prior to McCarthy's appointment as speaker of the House.[73] On February 26, 2019, the night before the scheduled public hearing of Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney, before the House Oversight Committee, Gaetz directed a tweet to Cohen that implied without evidence that Cohen had had multiple extramarital affairs and also suggested his wife might be unfaithful while he was imprisoned due to new information disclosed to her.[74] Other members of Congress saw the tweet as an attempt to intimidate a witness.[75][76] Gaetz initially defended his tweet, saying it was part of \"witness testing, not witness tampering\" and \"I don't threaten anybody.\" Asked to clarify, he said his \"tweet speaks for itself\".[77][78] After sharp criticism from other members of Congress and an implicit rebuke by speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi,[79][80] Gaetz deleted the tweet and posted a tweet in which he apologized.[78][76][81] Despite not being a member of the House Oversight Committee,[78] Gaetz appeared at Cohen's hearing, saying that he wanted to observe and ask questions.[82] During the hearing, U.S. Virgin Islands delegate Stacey Plaskett, a member of the Oversight Committee, recommended that Gaetz be referred to both the House Ethics Committee and criminal prosecutors for witness intimidation and tampering.[80][83] After the hearing, Gaetz reportedly texted an apology to Cohen, who thanked him for it.[84] The Florida Bar opened an investigation into Gaetz for the tweet,[85][86] as did the House Ethics Committee.[87] In August 2019, the Florida Bar announced it had found no probable cause that Gaetz had violated its rules.[88] Politico reported in April 2020 that Gaetz had spent nearly $200,000 of taxpayer funds renting an office from Collier Merrill, a Pensacola real estate developer and restaurateur and longtime friend, adviser, campaign donor, and legal client.[89] Gaetz and Merrill separately told Politico that Gaetz paid below-market rent for the space, but Gaetz later said that the rent was \"at or below market rate\".[90] House rules explicitly disallow below-market rentals, and require that parties to such leases \"have [not] had, [n]or continue to have, a professional or legal relationship (except as a landlord and tenant)\".[89] On July 1, 2020, the Office of Congressional Ethics notified Gaetz it had terminated its review of the lease arrangements.[91] In July 2020, Politico reported that its investigation had found expenditures by Gaetz that appeared to violate the House ethics rules: spending tens of thousands of dollars for a speech-writing consultant and having a private company install a television studio in his father's home in Niceville, Florida, which Gaetz uses when he appears on television.[92] Gaetz's office acknowledged that he spent $28,000 on speech-writing services, which is prohibited by House rules except in special circumstances and with prior approval from congressional officials, but said that it was a clerical error that would be fixed.[93][94] Of the television studio, Gaetz said that the company received $100 per month from his office, an amount not reported in his congressional spending records, and also charged television networks each time a network connected to the studio.[92] A statement from Gaetz's office said the arrangement complied with House rules, and that during the setup process, his office consulted with the House Ethics Committee and the House Administration Committee.[94] Gaetz and a dozen other Republican House members skipped votes and enlisted others to vote for them in late February 2021, citing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. But he and the other members were actually attending the Conservative Political Action Conference, which was held at the same time as their absences.[95] In response, the Campaign for Accountability, an ethics watchdog group, filed a complaint with the House Committee on Ethics and requested an investigation into Gaetz and the other lawmakers.[96] The Intercept reported in March 2023 that Gaetz had hired Derrick Miller as his military legislative aide. Miller spent eight years in prison after he was convicted of murdering a civilian during his army service in Afghanistan.[97] For the 118th Congress:[98] President-elect Trump announced he would nominate Gaetz to serve as United States attorney general on November 13, 2024.[104] Gaetz resigned from the U.S. House of Representatives shortly after the announcement.[105] His planned nomination was received negatively by multiple Senate Republicans, several of whom indicated that they would not support it due to standing allegations against him and perceived lack of qualifications.[106][107] On November 21, 2024, Gaetz announced on X that he was withdrawing his name from consideration as attorney general to avoid complicating the Trump transition.[108][109] The next day, he said he did not intend to join the 119th Congress, though he had already won reelection.[110] He later confirmed his resignation in writing.[111] Florida Governor Ron DeSantis requested that an interim election be held in Gaetz's former Florida district to fill his House seat, as is the constitutional procedure when there is a resignation.[112] In January 2025, Gaetz began hosting a 9 p.m. Eastern weeknight political talk show on One America News Network.[113] Gaetz has self-identified as a \"libertarian populist\".[114] Observers have described his views as far-right.[1] In January 2018, Gaetz invited Charles C. Johnson, an alt-right activist and Holocaust denier, to attend Donald Trump's State of the Union address.[115] Johnson previously raised money for the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer.[116] Gaetz defended Johnson in an interview, saying that Johnson was neither a Holocaust denier nor a white supremacist.[115] Gaetz has endorsed the white nationalist Great Replacement theory. In 2021, he called the Anti-Defamation League a \"racist organization\" after it condemned Tucker Carlson's promotion of Great Replacement theory. Gaetz said that Carlson \"is CORRECT about Replacement Theory as he explains what is happening to America.\"[117][118] Gaetz was an early supporter of Trump and his appeal to the Republican Party base, echoing his talking points. In several commercials during his 2016 congressional campaign, Gaetz promised to \"kill Muslim terrorists and build the wall\".[119] In a September 2022 episode of Steve Bannon's War Room podcast, Gaetz said that Republicans should prioritize \"impeachment inquiries\" against Democrats \"to investigate them and to hold them accountable\" if Republicans won the 2022 U.S. House of Representatives elections. He added, \"it should be investigations [of Democrats] first—[and] policy, bill-making, to support the lobbyists and the PACs, as a far, far diminished priority.\"[120] Gaetz has introduced legislation to reclassify cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act.[121][122] He has also introduced legislation to loosen federal restrictions on the cultivation of cannabis for research purposes.[123][124] Gaetz has criticized the federal government for having \"lied to the American people for a generation\" about the medical benefits of cannabis.[125] As a member of the Florida House, he sponsored a bill, eventually signed into law,[126] to expand the state's Right to Try Act to include the medical use of cannabis.[127][128] In September 2017, Gaetz keynoted the American Medical Marijuana Physicians Association's annual conference.[129] In November 2019, Gaetz was one of only two Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee to vote for the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act, which among other reforms sought to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act.[130] He was also the only Republican cosponsor of the bill (of 55 cosponsors) at the time of its passage.[131] Gaetz introduced the STATES Act to prevent federal interference in states that have legalized cannabis for medical or recreational purposes.[132] Gaetz said he had multiple conversations with President Trump about cannabis policy.[133] Nonetheless, Gaetz did not find positions on marijuana to be a dealbreaker in the 2024 Republican Speaker nominee selection, repeatedly supporting anti-cannabis candidates.[134][135][136] Worried about protesters disrupting his appearance at his town hall in Pace, Florida, Gaetz prepared what his staffers called a nonverbal town hall on February 23, 2017. He printed out part of his speech onto giant boards that he would hold up if he was unable to speak.[137] Gaetz arrived 30 minutes late to the meeting, where at least 500 constituents crowded into a bowling alley. At the meeting, he was questioned about his relationship with Trump, his stance on repealing the Affordable Care Act, and his proposal to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency. He said that Trump should release his tax returns, but stopped short of saying Congress should subpoena them. Gaetz closed his town hall by shouting Trump's 2016 campaign slogan, \"Make America Great Again\".[138][139][140] Gaetz is seen as a vocal ally of Trump.[141] Politico called Gaetz \"one of the most enthusiastic defenders of president Trump on cable news\" and a \"proud Trump protégé\" in April 2018.[142] Aaron Blake of The Washington Post called him one of Congress' \"most controversial members\", and one who has \"unabashedly aligned himself with Trump on basically all things\".[74][143] In May 2018, Gaetz was one of 18 House Republicans to vote to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in peace talks with North Korea.[144][145] Appearing on The View in February 2020, shortly before Trump associate Roger Stone was sentenced, Gaetz said he would support a pardon for Stone.[146] Gaetz is a member of the House Judiciary Committee, but not of the Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, or Oversight and Reform Committees, and so was not allowed to join lawmakers' closed-door deposition of former White House Russia aide Fiona Hill in October 2019. He told reporters that, since his committee oversees impeachment, he should have been allowed to be part of depositions related to the Trump impeachment inquiry.[147] On April 6, The New York Times reported that during the final weeks of Trump's first presidency, Gaetz privately asked the White House for a blanket pardon for himself and some unknown congressional allies for any crimes they may have committed.[148] The White House reportedly never seriously considered the request, because it was decided that issuing preemptive pardons would set a bad precedent.[149][150][148] The Times also reported that aides had told Trump of the request. On April 7, Trump denied that Gaetz had asked him for a pardon and noted that Gaetz \"totally denied the accusations against him\".[151] The same day, CNN's Maggie Haberman revealed that Trump had reportedly wanted to defend Gaetz, but that his advisors talked him out of it due to the seriousness of the allegations.[152][153] In November 2017, Gaetz introduced a congressional resolution calling for Robert Mueller to recuse himself as special counsel because of what were said to be conflicts of interest.[154] He also asked for a special counsel investigation into the Federal Bureau of Investigation's handling of the Hillary Clinton email controversy, undue interference by U.S. attorney general Loretta Lynch in the investigation, and the Russian state corporation Rosatom's acquisition of Uranium One during Mueller's time as FBI director.[155][156] Gaetz said he did not trust Mueller to lead the investigation because of Mueller's alleged involvement in approval of the Uranium One deal and alleged close relationship with dismissed FBI director James Comey, a probable person of interest in a proposed new investigation.[157][158] After Ohio congressman Jim Jordan denied that he was aware of the sexual abuse of Ohio State University wrestlers during the period when Jordan was a coach there,[159] Gaetz said that the allegations came from people in the \"deep state\" and were intended to reduce the credibility of Jordan's criticism of Mueller's investigation of the Trump campaign and Russia.[160][161] Gaetz said of then–U.S. attorney general Jeff Sessions that \"over at the Department of Justice, he's got Stockholm syndrome, he's become sympathetic with his captors over there in the Deep State.\"[162] During Mueller's testimony to two congressional committees on July 24, 2019, Gaetz told him, \"If Russians were lying to Christopher Steele to undermine our confidence in our newly elected president, that would be precisely in your purview because you stated in your opening that the organizing principle was to fully and thoroughly investigate Russian interference. But you weren't interested in whether the Russians interfered through Steele—and if Steele was lying, then you should have charged him with lying like you charged a variety of other people.\"[163] In October 2019, Gaetz organized a \"storming\" of a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility on Capitol Hill by about two dozen Republican congressmen, including House minority whip Steve Scalise, in an effort to sit in on and hear the deposition of a Pentagon official during the impeachment inquiry into Trump. The congressmens' cell phones and other devices put the secure facility, and U.S. national security, at risk.[164][165][166] One committee member said, \"It was the closest thing I've seen around here to mass civil unrest as a member of Congress.\"[167][168] House Homeland Security Committee chairman Bennie Thompson of Mississippi wrote to the House sergeant-at-arms about Gaetz and others, requesting that he take action regarding their \"unprecedented breach of security\". South Carolina's senior U.S. senator, Lindsey Graham, admonished the House members, calling them \"nuts\" for having made a \"run on the SCIF\".[169][166] Ohio representative Jim Jordan said, \"The members have just had it, and they want to be able to see and represent their constituents and find out what's going on.\"[166] A day later, Jordan appeared on Fox News to justify the intrusion, saying of the chair of the committee: \"Adam Schiff is doing this unfair, partisan process in secret and our members finally said, 'Enough'. We're so frustrated. They reached a boiling point and these guys marched in and said we want to know what's going on.\"[169] In the 116th Congress, Pelosi, who is a committee member ex officio, appointed Schiff and 12 Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee.[170] House minority leader Kevin McCarthy, also an ex officio member, appointed the ranking member, Devin Nunes, and eight other Republicans to the committee.[171] Each side got equal time to question witnesses.[167] The disruption delayed Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary Laura Cooper's testimony by many hours.[165][166] On January 7, 2021, after Trump supporters violently broke into the U.S. Capitol, Gaetz falsely blamed antifa for the attack, suggesting that rioters were \"masquerading as Trump supporters\".[172][173] Joel Valdez, a senior communications aide to Gaetz, posted a video on Parler hours before the storming of the Capitol with the caption \"From the top of the Capitol office buildings, WE HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR! #StopTheSteal\".[174] Gaetz voted against the second impeachment of Donald Trump. Gaetz co-sponsored a resolution by Andy Biggs to impeach Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas in August 2021.[175] Later that month, Gaetz co-sponsored a resolution by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene to impeach president Biden.[176] In September 2022, he called impeaching Biden a \"priority\".[177] He expressed the belief that many Republicans in Congress were hesitant to impeach Biden, but that Republican voters would feel \"betrayed\" if they did not.[178] Very early into the 118th Congress, Gaetz cosponsored another resolution to impeach Mayorkas.[179] In May 2023, Gaetz co-sponsored resolutions by Marjorie Taylor Greene to impeach Biden and Mayorkas.[180][181] During an invitation-only video conference moderated by Steve Bannon days after a Biden impeachment inquiry was opened in September 2023, Gaetz denounced the impeachment effort as a political stunt. Gaetz said, \"I don't believe that we are endeavoring upon a legitimate impeachment of Joe Biden ... I think it's for the sake of having another bad thing to say about Joe Biden.\"[182] Gaetz voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.[183] He acknowledged that the bill's pass-through tax deduction would benefit Trump, but added, \"so many Americans benefit when commercial real estate becomes easier and more accessible.\"[184] Gaetz was among the 71 Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.[185] Gaetz acknowledged global warming in 2016 but said he disagrees with the scientific consensus on climate change that human activity is the primary cause.[186] In April 2017, the Center for American Progress and Vice Media said Gaetz was a climate change denier, citing his 2016 statements.[187][non-primary source needed][188] Gaetz proposed legislation to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency in January 2017, claiming that it hurts small businesses via the costs associated with compliance.[27][189] Gaetz joined the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus in November 2017.[190][191] He said he advocated technological innovation and economic incentives that address climate change, and increased federal funds for global warming research by NASA, NOAA and universities, but remained opposed to increased environmental regulation.[192] Gaetz and Democratic Representative Scott Peters introduced the bipartisan Super Pollutants Act, which aimed to slow climate change by regulating greenhouses gases, especially black carbon, hydrofluorocarbons, and methane, in 2019.[193] A press release stated, \"These short-lived climate pollutants, also called super pollutants, are significantly more potent than carbon dioxide.\"[194] In 2021, Gaetz was one of 14 House Republicans to vote against a measure condemning the Myanmar coup d'état that overwhelmingly passed, for reasons reported to be unclear.[195] On October 12, 2017, Gaetz introduced a resolution affirming the connection between the Jewish people and Jerusalem and condemning UNESCO's efforts to the contrary.[196] In December 2017, he supported Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and said that the move would pressure Palestine to recognize Israel.[197] In 2019, Gaetz was one of 60 representatives to vote against condemning Trump's withdrawal from Syria.[198] In April 2019, after the House passed a resolution withdrawing American support for the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, Gaetz was one of nine lawmakers to sign a letter to Trump requesting a meeting with him and urging him to sign Senate Joint Resolution 7, which invokes the War Powers Act of 1973, to end unauthorized US military participation in the Saudi-led coalition's armed conflict against Houthi forces in Yemen.[199] In June 2021, Gaetz was one of 49 House Republicans to vote to repeal the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002.[200][201] In 2023, Gaetz was among 47 Republicans to vote in favor of H.Con.Res. 21, which directed president Joe Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.[202][203] He voted to provide Israel with support following 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.[204][205] In March 2024, Niger announced it was ending its security relationship with the United States, which had been in place since 2012.[206] In a report issued by Gaetz the following month, Gaetz stated that the United States embassy in Niger was suppressing information related to the decay of Niger-United States diplomatic relations.[206] According to Gaetz's report, Niger has not authorized flights for United States Department of Defense efforts, including the sending of food, equipment, mail, or medical supplies.[206] In April 2024, Gaetz voted against the $60 billion military aid package for Ukraine, although much of the money would have gone to his constituency.[207] On June 1, 2020, during the nationwide George Floyd protests, Gaetz tweeted, \"Now that we clearly see antifa as terrorists, can we hunt them down like we do those in the Middle East?\" In response, Twitter hid the tweet and labeled it as \"[violating] the Twitter Rules about glorifying violence\". Gaetz called the label a \"badge of honor\", accused Twitter of enabling antifa, and again said that \"[o]ur government should hunt [Antifa] down\".[208] On August 26, 2020, Gaetz tweeted \"The mob wants to destroy America. We need PATRIOTS who will defend her\"[209] in support of Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old from Antioch, Illinois, who traveled to Kenosha, Wisconsin, and shot and killed two people in self-defense during the protests of the Jacob Blake shooting.[210][211][212] Gaetz was one of three representatives to offer Rittenhouse a Congressional internship.[213] Former National Rifle Association president Marion Hammer called Gaetz \"one of the most pro-gun members to have ever served in the Florida Legislature\".[214] Gaetz is a lifetime member of the NRA,[214] and has an A+ rating from it.[215] When Gaetz served in the Florida House of Representatives, he led an unsuccessful effort to allow Floridians with concealed-weapons permits to carry those weapons openly in public.[216] In lobbying for the bill, he said that the open carry of weapons was a right \"granted not by government but by God\".[217] Gaetz supports Florida's stand-your-ground law and supported legislation that strengthened it against legal challenges.[218] He also supports concealed carry reciprocity.[218] During a May 2021 \"America First\" rally with Marjorie Taylor Greene, Gaetz told an audience: \"We have a Second Amendment in this country, and I think we have an obligation to use it!\" He then said this meant allowing Americans \"the ability to maintain an armed rebellion against the government if that becomes necessary\".[219][220] Immediately before his remarks on the Second Amendment, Gaetz criticized Big Tech companies for trying to \"suppress us, discourage us\", saying, \"Silicon Valley can't cancel this movement, or this rally, or this congressman\". As a result, politicians including Ted Lieu accused Gaetz of inciting violence against Silicon Valley employees, which Gaetz denied.[221][222] In October 2017, Gaetz argued that the Medicaid expansion permitted by the Affordable Care Act fueled the opioid crisis.[223] PolitiFact rated the claim \"mostly false\", noting that \"experts were universal in saying that the evidence that Medicaid expansion is somehow fueling the opioid crisis doesn't exist.\"[223] In June 2021, Gaetz introduced the Digital Health Pass Prevention Act (DHPPA), a bill aimed at preventing the federal government from funding and enforcing any digital passes associated with COVID-19 vaccination status, with the support of representatives Louie Gohmert and Lance Gooden.[224] The full title of the bill is \"To prohibit Federal funds from being used to implement, administer, enforce, or carry out programs with respect to digital health passes, and for other purposes.\"[225] It was sent to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce which referred it to the Subcommittee on Health. No further action was reported.[226] In early March 2020, Gaetz wore a gas mask during a House debate on funds to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.[227] He argued that wearing the gas mask was not an act of mockery but a way of \"demonstrating his concern\".[228] Several journalists characterized the decision as a stunt.[229][230][231] A few days later, on March 9, Gaetz's office reported that he had been in contact with a Conservative Political Action Conference attendee who tested positive for COVID-19. As a result, Gaetz was placed under self-quarantine for 14 days. On March 10, he said his test was negative, but that he would stay under self-quarantine until the 14-day period ended on March 12.[232] On April 14, Gaetz said the Wuhan Institute of Virology \"birthed a monster\", a reference to the hypothesis that COVID-19 was leaked out of a Chinese research lab.[233] He also stated that the National Institutes of Health had given the Institute a $3.7 million grant. The U.S.-based EcoHealth Alliance that worked with the Institute under a grant the Trump administration approved, eventually had that funding withdrawn.[233] The EcoHealth Alliance later said that, under the grant, it had enhanced a bat coronavirus so it became potentially more infectious to humans, which the NIH said was an \"unexpected result\" of the research it had funded that was carried out in partnership with the Wuhan Institute. Nevertheless, the NIH denied it had helped create the virus that sparked the COVID-19 pandemic.[234][235] After Politico reported on November 7 that Gaetz had tested positive for COVID-19, he texted Politico \"I have tested positive for antibodies\" and \"I have no live virus\". He said he had no symptoms and was not sure when he had contracted the disease.[236] On December 4, 2020, Gaetz attended an indoor New York Young Republicans Club conference in Jersey City, New Jersey, during a period of surging COVID-19 cases throughout the state and the country. He was seen posing for photos in a crowd of unmasked attendees, prompting New Jersey governor Phil Murphy and Jersey City mayor Steven Fulop to publicly condemn him. Gaetz and other GOP members mocked Democrats and their COVID-19 regulations on social media. Murphy also said state officials were investigating whether the event violated the state's COVID-19 regulations.[237] After a contentious House committee hearing on June 10, 2021, Gaetz said a Chinese whistle-blower possessed text messages and documents concerning COVID-19's origins that US government investigators had failed to pursue.[238] On July 31, Gaetz said of COVID-19 variants that \"next it'll be the Chi Omega variant or the Pi Kappa Psi variant. I got the Florida variant. I got the freedom variant. It affects the brain. It gets you to think for yourself where you don't just surrender to the truth that they're trying to create in corrupt big media.\"[239] Gaetz opposes abortion. On July 23, 2022, he gave a speech at a Student Action Summit gathering in Tampa, Florida, in which he said that overweight or unattractive women were unlikely to become pregnant and mocked them for supporting abortion rights, saying, \"They're like 5'2\", 350 pounds, and they're like, 'Give me my abortions or I'll get up and march and protest.'\"[240][241] Olivia Julianna, a Texas teenager, tweeted a post mocking Gaetz, who responded with a photo of her that, according to NPR, implied his comments had touched a nerve; she used the incident to raise over $2 million for abortion funds.[240][242] On December 19, 2017, Gaetz was the only representative to vote against the Combating Human Trafficking in Commercial Vehicles Act, a bill allocating additional government resources to help combat human trafficking.[243][244][245] Gaetz later explained that his vote was due to his small government principles and his belief that existing federal agencies could adequately combat human trafficking.[245][246] On February 27, 2018, Gaetz voted against the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, which had by then been combined with the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act. It passed, 388–25.[247] On July 26, 2022, Gaetz voted against the Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection Reauthorization Act, which passed 401–20.[248] Gaetz opposes sanctuary cities, which limit their cooperation with the federal government in enforcing immigration law.[249] Upon announcing his run for Congress in 2016, he said that undocumented immigrants were \"sucking us dry\".[250] In January 2018, Gaetz defended a statement by Trump that reportedly said Haiti and African nations were \"shithole\" countries, saying that Haiti was covered by \"sheet metal and garbage\" and in \"disgusting\" condition.[251] In October 2018, Gaetz falsely stated that George Soros paid for a caravan of migrants from Central America to the United States.[252] Gaetz voted against the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 which authorizes DHS to nearly double the available H-2B visas for the remainder of FY 2020.[253][254] Gaetz voted against Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1158), an act which effectively prohibits ICE from cooperating with Health and Human Services to detain or remove illegal alien sponsors of unaccompanied alien children (UACs).[255][256] Gaetz tweeted on June 23, 2021 that the FBI should be defunded. At that time, it was investigating him for alleged sex trafficking and having sex with a minor. He wrote, \"If Democrats want to defund the police, they should start with the FBI.\"[257] Gaetz later deleted the tweet.[258][259] The week before, he claimed without evidence that \"FBI operatives organized and participated in the January 6th Capitol riot.\"[257] As of 2024[update], there is still no evidence for such a claim.[260] As a Florida state representative in 2015, Gaetz and Representative David Richardson sponsored an amendment to repeal the state ban on same-sex adoptions.[261] He also persuaded his father, in the Florida State Senate, to support the repeal.[262] In 2015, after the U.S. Supreme Court decided Obergefell v. Hodges, which established the legal recognition of same-sex marriage in the United States, Gaetz said he disagreed with the court's ruling, saying that each state should have the right to decide for itself whether to allow same-sex marriage. He argued that the decision was an example of \"judicial activism\" that posed \"a threat to our democracy\".[263] During the 116th Congress, Gaetz voted against the Equality Act,[264] which would ban discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity in federal law. In 2022, Gaetz voted against the Respect for Marriage Act,[265] which repealed the Defense of Marriage Act, which restricted legal recognition of marriage to opposite-sex marriage in federal law. In 2024, Gaetz condemned schools for promoting what he described as \"degenerate LGBT and anti-White propaganda\" as he introduced his \"National Prayer In School Act\".[266][267][268] Gaetz was one of 39 Republicans to vote for the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2022, an antitrust package that would crack down on corporations for anti-competitive behavior.[269][270] Gaetz's tenure as congressman was widely criticized and controversial, with The New York Times noting accusations of:[107] sexual misconduct and illicit drug use; sharing inappropriate images or videos on the House floor; misusing state identification records; converting campaign funds to personal use; and accepting impermissible gifts under House rules.[107] Gaetz routinely conflicted with members of Republican leadership. In October 2023, Gaetz filed a motion to vacate which led to the removal of Kevin McCarthy as speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives.[68] Former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson wrote in her memoir that, during a trip to Camp David in 2020, Gaetz made \"repeated passes\" at her and asked her to \"escort\" him to his room. Gaetz has denied these actions.[271] In January 2020, the U.S. Secret Service reportedly received a tip that, in April 2018, Gaetz had accompanied Seminole County tax collector Joel Greenberg to a government office where Greenberg was producing fake IDs.[272] Greenberg was indicted in August 2020 on an array of charges, including sex trafficking a 17-year-old girl in 2017 and creating fake IDs to facilitate sex trafficking.[273][274] The investigation of Greenberg led federal officials to look into some of Gaetz's related activities.[272] In late 2020, the Justice Department opened its investigation of Gaetz for allegedly sex trafficking the same 17-year-old girl in 2017 and whether he had violated federal sex trafficking laws by paying her to travel with him across state lines.[273][275][276] As part of his plea bargain, Greenberg cooperated with the investigation of Gaetz and others.[277][278] Axios reported that Gaetz was \"seriously considering not seeking re-election and possibly leaving Congress early for a job at Newsmax\" on March 30, 2021.[279] The same day, The New York Times reported the Justice Department's investigation of Gaetz.[273] According to CNN, a person briefed on the matter said investigators also examined whether Gaetz used campaign money in his relationships with young women for travel and expenses and whether cash and drugs were involved.[280] By April 2, the Justice Department was examining whether Gaetz asked women to recruit others for sex.[281][282] According to the 2021 reports, federal investigators were looking into Gaetz's September 2018 trip to the Bahamas.[274] Gaetz was reportedly joined by marijuana entrepreneur and hand surgeon Jason Pirozzolo, who allegedly paid trip accommodations, traveling expenses, and escort services. Investigators were reportedly exploring whether the escorts were sexually trafficked for Gaetz and whether Gaetz accepted paid escorts in exchange for political access or legislative favors for Pirozzolo, who at the time chaired the board of the Medical Marijuana Physicians Association. Gaetz made two speeches for the organization while in Congress, and Pirozzolo gave two separate donations of $1,000 to Gaetz's campaign arm, \"Friends of Matt Gaetz\", in March 2016 and May 2017.[283] A spokeswoman for Gaetz denied the new allegations.[284] A woman on the Bahamas trip—a Capitol Hill intern who did not work in Gaetz's office but who was dating him—reportedly agreed in May 2021 to cooperate with investigators, who believe she has information about Gaetz's financial transactions on the trip.[285][286] Investigators believe that Greenberg met women through a website for sex and introduced them to Gaetz, who also had sex with them.[273] Evidence including mobile payment receipts reportedly suggesting Gaetz had illegally exchanged money for sex, such as May 2018 Venmo transaction records showing Gaetz sending $900 (with a memo referring to a woman) to Greenberg, who then relayed the money (with the memos \"tuition\" and \"school\") to three women, one of whom was 18.[287] Joseph Ellicott, an associate of both Gaetz and Greenberg, pleaded guilty in January 2022 to two charges related to this investigation and is also cooperating with authorities.[288] Gaetz had argued in a November 2020 Fox News appearance that Trump \"should pardon Michael Flynn [and] everyone from himself to his administration officials to Joe Exotic\".[289][290] In late 2020, Greenberg apparently attempted to secure a pardon from the Trump administration via a confession letter (first reported by The Daily Beast in April 2021), writing that he and Gaetz had had sex with a 17-year-old girl they believed was 19, which Greenberg learned of on September 4, 2017, and that payments had been made on behalf of Gaetz to her and other women in exchange for sex.[291] Greenberg attempted to bribe Roger Stone with a $250,000 Bitcoin payment to secure a presidential pardon, texting Stone, \"They know [Gaetz] paid me to pay the girls and that he and I both had sex with the girl who was underage.\"[291] By the end of the Trump administration, Greenberg was under indictment, investigators had been questioning some Gaetz associates, and federal agents had seized the phone of one of Gaetz's former girlfriends.[292] Gaetz's phone was also seized, and he changed his phone number in late December.[274] Denying any sexual relationships with minors, Gaetz said on March 30, 2021, that he did not plan to resign from the House.[273] That same day, he tweeted that he and his family were \"victims of an organized criminal extortion involving a former DOJ official seeking $25 million\".[273][293] This allegedly began on March 16, with a text message to his father demanding money in exchange for making sex trafficking allegations \"go away\".[294] Gaetz and his father purportedly received communications saying that the FBI had photographs of Gaetz engaged in a \"sexual orgy with underage prostitutes\". The sender demanded millions of dollars to help secure the release of U.S. federal agent Robert Levinson (who had disappeared in Iran in 2007 and had already been presumed and declared dead),[295][296] proposing that president Joe Biden would pardon Gaetz as a reward for freeing Levinson.[297][298] The sender was later identified as Florida developer Stephen Alford, who was arrested on August 31.[299][300] Gaetz said his attorneys contacted the FBI, whom he said had informed them that Gaetz was a subject, not a target, of an investigation. He also said his father agreed to wear a \"wire\" to help the FBI record the alleged extortionists.[301] Gaetz sent Axios screenshots of text messages, emails and documents outlining the alleged extortion scheme, which he asserted was being run by David McGee,[302] a former federal prosecutor who has been a private attorney since 2005[303] and has represented the Levinson family.[304] McGee's law firm called Gaetz's allegation \"completely, totally false\" and defamatory,[294] telling The Daily Beast that Gaetz was attempting to distract from the sex trafficking investigation.[305] Alford, who has previously been federally convicted of fraud and is represented by McGee, was federally indicted in August 2021 for allegedly conducting the scheme. Prosecutors alleged that Alford said he had contacts in the Justice Department who could arrange for a presidential pardon for Gaetz and directed Don Gaetz to wire the money to a trust account managed by McGee. McGee reportedly met with Don Gaetz before Alford did,[304][306] but apparently did not discuss a presidential pardon, which Alford later admitted to the FBI that he had lied about his ability to arrange.[296] Also on March 30, Tucker Carlson interviewed Gaetz on Fox News. In addition to denying the allegations about his relationship with a 17-year-old girl, Gaetz denied a previously unreported claim that he had been photographed \"with child prostitutes\", and said that the FBI had urged a friend of his (whom Carlson had supposedly met) to claim Gaetz was \"involved in some pay-for-play scheme\". He also argued that \"Providing for flights and hotel rooms for people that you're dating who are of legal age is not a crime.\"[307][308][309] House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said he had no plans to remove Gaetz from his seats on the Judiciary and Armed Services Committees on March 31, 2021, but that he might change his mind if Gaetz \"gets indicted\"[310] or \"if it comes out to be true\".[311] CNN reported on April 1 that Gaetz had shown pictures of naked women to colleagues on the House floor. Gaetz had allegedly claimed to have slept with the women in the photos.[312] The next day, his communications director, Luke Ball, and his legislative director, Devin Murphy, resigned. Both had begun working for Gaetz when he joined Congress in 2017.[313][314][315] On April 6, The New York Times reported that in the last weeks of the Trump administration, Gaetz privately requested a blanket presidential pardon for himself and others, which was reportedly denied because it would set a bad precedent.[290] The next day, Trump publicly denied that Gaetz had asked him for a pardon.[316] On April 7, journalist Maggie Haberman revealed on CNN that Trump had reportedly wanted to defend Gaetz but was told to stand down due to the seriousness of the allegations.[152][153] Gaetz's congressional office released a statement purportedly from his female employees vouching for his character, stating they \"uniformly reject these allegations as false\" on April 8. Gaetz's new communications director, Joel Valdez, told Forbes that \"all of the office's eight female staffers signed it\", but the version of the statement that was released did not have anyone's signature or identify any specific employee.[317] That evening, Representative Adam Kinzinger tweeted that Gaetz should resign, becoming the first congressional Republican to make such a call.[318][319] The House Ethics Committee opened an investigation on April 9 into allegations that Gaetz \"may have engaged in sexual misconduct and/or illicit drug use, shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, misused state identification records, converted campaign funds to personal use, and/or accepted a bribe, improper gratuity, or impermissible gift\".[320] The committee deferred its investigation at the request of the Justice Department, but resumed it in June 2023.[321][322] In late April, Gaetz fundraised to run his own political ads, claiming that he was under attack by powerful interests such as \"big government, big tech, big business, big media\" that perceived him as a political threat.[323] A public relations firm hired by Gaetz issued a denial statement regarding The Daily Beast's reporting on Greenberg's correspondence implicating him and Gaetz.[291] Greenberg pleaded guilty to multiple crimes on May 17 in a plea bargain in which he would have to cooperate with prosecutors.[278] By June, the federal investigation had reportedly broadened to include obstruction of justice, relating to Gaetz's phone conversation with a witness.[324][325] Later in June, ABC News reported that the investigation had engulfed many in the Central Florida political scene and that prosecutors could decide whether to bring charges against Gaetz as early as July.[326] In August, ABC News reported that Greenberg had \"provided investigators with years of Venmo and Cash App transactions and thousands of photos and videos, as well as access to personal social media accounts\". These include September 2018 text messages between Greenberg and a woman engaging in prostitution, which indicate that a prostitute was arranged for Gaetz and that MDMA may have been proffered. A spokesperson for Gaetz said, \"not one woman has come forward to accuse Rep. Gaetz of wrongdoing\" and that Gaetz had \"addressed the debunked allegations against him\" on his new podcast, Firebrand.[327][328] According to Greenberg, he made the arrangements for Gaetz.[327] Two top Washington prosecutors—a public corruption investigator with expertise in child exploitation crimes and a leader of the public corruption unit—have worked on Gaetz's case since at least mid-2021.[329] Greenberg's sentencing hearing was originally scheduled for August 2021,[330] but due to his cooperation in related investigations, had been repeatedly delayed.[331][332] In January 2022, an ex-girlfriend of Gaetz's testified before a grand jury after being granted immunity;[333] she reportedly had information relevant to two of three criminal charges being considered for Gaetz: sex trafficking a minor and obstruction of justice.[333] (A year later, her attorney said that Justice Department prosecutors made the right decision not to charge Gaetz because \"they didn't have evidence to prove a crime\".)[334] Gaetz was also accused of violating the Mann Act, which prohibits sex trafficking across state lines.[335] Later in January 2022, Joseph Ellicott confessed that on September 4, 2017, he witnessed Greenberg telling Gaetz over the phone that the woman they had both had sex with was underage.[336][337][338] Thanks to his assistance with the prosecutors in a series of investigations, including those involving Gaetz, Greenberg was sentenced to 11 years in prison, plus 10 years of supervised release, on December 1, 2022.[339] The sentencing judge, Gregory A. Presnell, said, \"He has provided substantial cooperation to the government...more than I've seen in 22 years.\"[339] Court documents filed in September 2024 stated that, according to multiple eyewitnesses, Gaetz had attended a party in 2017 alongside a 17-year-old girl, at the home of lobbyist Chris Dorworth where people engaged in sexual activities and did drugs, including cocaine, ecstasy, and cannabis.[340][341] A September 2022 Washington Post article reported that prosecutors had recommended not to charge Gaetz in the sex trafficking investigation, telling Justice Department superiors that a conviction is unlikely in part because of credibility questions about the two central witnesses.[342] In February 2023, the DOJ communicated to the attorneys for Gaetz that they had concluded their investigation and would not be laying charges against him, effectively ending a multiyear probe including allegations of misconduct.[343] The House Ethics Committee began its probe in April 2021 into Gaetz's alleged misconduct but soon paused it while the DOJ investigated. Shortly after the February 2023 conclusion of the DOJ investigation, the House Ethics Committee reopened its probe.[344][345] Two women, both represented by attorney Joel Leppard, testified that Gaetz paid them for sex. One of those women said that in July 2017, she saw Gaetz having sex with her 17-year-old friend and that once Gaetz became aware of the girl's age, he paused the relationship until she turned 18.[346] The woman who was 17 at the time of the incident told the House Ethics Committee that she had two sexual encounters with Gaetz at the same party.[347] The DOJ had charted payments showing that, between July 2017 and January 2019, Gaetz paid both women a total of over $10,000 across 27 Venmo transactions and a check. The committee received this chart from the DOJ, but the DOJ did not turn over other information the committee requested.[348][349] The committee also contacted Gaetz's ex-girlfriend who in 2022 had received immunity and testified in the criminal investigation, though reportedly it did not expect her to cooperate in the ethics investigation voluntarily.[350] In mid-November 2024, days before the committee was scheduled to vote whether to release its report, which was nearly complete and which insiders said was \"highly critical\" of Gaetz,[351][352][353] Gaetz resigned from the House, in part due to an announcement of his nomination as United States Attorney General for Donald Trump's second term.[354] This caused the committee to lose jurisdiction to continue its probe[355] and, under the House's own rules, it cannot release the report either. (Despite this internal rule, the House has released reports on former members before.)[356] House Speaker Mike Johnson said he would \"strongly request that the Ethics Committee not issue the report\".[357] Given the Senate's role in approving Gaetz's nomination for Attorney General, several senators including Joni Ernst, John Curtis, John Cornyn, and Markwayne Mullin called on the House to allow them to review the Ethics Committee report.[358][359] Attorneys for the two women called for the report to be released publicly: John Clune (representing the woman who had been 17 at the time of the incident) and Joel Leppard (representing the witness).[356][360] The sworn testimony of the woman who said she had sex with Gaetz in 2017 when she was 17, along with corroborating eyewitness testimony to that sexual encounter, was obtained by a hacker on November 18. A lawyer on the case noticed the suspicious download. The hacker did not immediately leak the material.[361] The House Ethics Committee decided that by December 5, it would finish its report and vote on whether to release it.[362][363] Gaetz withdrew his nomination for attorney general on November 21,[364] and indicated the following day that he would not return to the House.[365] The House Ethics Committee voted to release its report in December 2024.[366] It was made public on December 23. The Ethics Committee report concluded that Gaetz had violated Florida state laws, including those prohibiting statutory rape, procurement of prostitution, and illicit drug use, but that Gaetz did not engage in sex trafficking across state lines. The committee identified at least 20 occasions on which he had paid women for sex or drugs. It found a total of over $90,000 in payments to the 17-year-old girl and 11 other women.[367][2][368][369] Gaetz was arrested for driving under the influence as he was driving back from a nightclub on Okaloosa Island, Florida, in 2008. Police recorded him driving 48 mph (77 km/h) in a 35 mph (56 km/h) zone and noted that he showed physical signs of intoxication.[370] Gaetz initially denied that he had drunk alcohol, but later admitted to drinking two beers. He failed an eye test twice, then declined field sobriety tests. After Gaetz was arrested, he refused to take a breathalyzer test.[370] Shortly after Gaetz's case was referred to state attorney Steve Meadows, Gaetz's driving license was reinstated. Though Florida law requires a year's suspension when a driver refuses a breathalyzer test, Gaetz's suspension was less than a year. His refusal also did not lead to a criminal prosecution, during which it could have been used against him. A field officer for the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles declared there was no evidence that Gaetz refused a breathalyzer test, despite the arresting police officer having documented it in an affidavit and the arrest report and Gaetz's own attorney also having documented it, too. Gaetz's attorney also argued that an unnamed witness who knew Gaetz \"observed no indication of impairment\".[370] The charges against Gaetz were dismissed.[370] Gaetz has published a 2020 book and a 2021 podcast, both titled Firebrand. In both, he criticizes former House speaker Paul Ryan for joining the board of Fox News's parent company and blames him for canceling Lou Dobbs Tonight.[328][371] In the book, while discussing dating in Washington, he writes, \"I knew going in how many people had been brought down by sexual missteps in this town, so I set some rules to help me err on the safe(r) side ... [including] no dating your staff members, [etc.].\"[371] In December 2020, Gaetz announced his engagement to his girlfriend, Ginger Luckey, the sister of Oculus VR founder and major Republican donor Palmer Luckey.[372] They married in August 2021.[373] Gaetz is a Baptist.[374] On several occasions he has mentioned that he had regarded his ex-girlfriend's younger brother, Nestor Galbán, as his family.[375] Though Gaetz has referred to Galbán as his son in the past, the two are not related genetically or legally.[376][377][378]",

                "content": "Matthew Louis Gaetz II[1] (/ɡeɪts/; born May 7, 1982) is an American lawyer and politician. He was the U.S. representative for Florida's 1st congressional district from 2017 to 2024. He is a member of the Republican Party. He is known as a strict Trump supporter.[2] He has been seen as a strong supporter of far-right politics as well as an ally of president-reelect Donald Trump.[3][4] In 2020, Gaetz was accused of sex trafficking and having sexual relationships with minors.[5] In October 2023, Gaetz filed a motion to vacate which led to the removal of Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives.[6][7] In November 2024, President-elect Donald Trump announced he would nominate Gaetz to serve as United States attorney general.[8] Gaetz resigned from the U.S. House of Representatives shortly after his nomination.[9] However after controversy regarding sexual abuse and sex trafficking accusations, Gaetz withdrew his nomination on November 21, 2024.[10] Matthew Louis Gaetz II was born on May 7, 1982, in Hollywood, Florida, to Victoria (née Quertermous) and Don Gaetz, a politician.[11][12][13] He was raised near Fort Walton Beach.[14][15] He graduated from Florida State University in 2003 and from the William & Mary Law School in 2007.[16][17] He became a lawyer in 2008.[18] Gaetz worked at the law firm Keefe, Anchors & Gordon (now AnchorsGordon)[19] in Fort Walton Beach.[20] In October 2021, the Florida bar banned Gaetz from practicing law because of unpaid fees.[21] He was allowed to become a lawyer again after the $265 fee was paid.[22] In March 2010, Gaetz ran in the special election in the 4th district for the Florida Senate.[23] He won with 43 percent of the vote.[23] In the special general election, Gaetz beat Democratic nominee Jan Fernald with 66 percent of the vote.[24] He ran for re-election and won in 2010 (for a full term), then in 2012 and 2014.[25] Gaetz supported the death penalty during his time in the state senate.[26] Gaetz was one of two members to vote against a Florida bill making revenge porn illegal in 2015.[27] In 2015, Gaetz supported the presidential campaign of former Governor Jeb Bush.[28] In 2013, Gaetz announced that, in 2016, he would run for the 1st district Florida State Senate seat held by his father, Don Gaetz.[29] In March 2016, Gaetz decided to run for the U.S. House instead.[30] In August 2016, Gaetz won the Republican primary with 35.7 percent.[31] In the November general election, Gaetz beat Democratic nominee Steven Specht with 69 percent of the vote.[32] He was re-elected in 2018, 2020, 2022 and 2024. In January 2018, Gaetz invited alt-right Holocaust denier Charles C. Johnson to Donald Trump's State of the Union address.[33] Gaetz has gone to political rallies in 2018 and 2019 at which members of the Proud Boys were present.[34][35] On January 10, 2021, House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy argued with Gaetz on a phone call that he was unnecessarily \"putting people in jeopardy\" during the January 6 United States Capitol attack.[36] In June 2021, Gaetz was one of 21 House Republicans to vote against a resolution to give the Congressional Gold Medal to police officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on January 6.[37] Gaetz, a critic of Kevin McCarthy, voted against him for Speaker of the U.S. House, instead nominating former President Donald Trump.[38][39][40] He made it harder for McCarthy to become speaker, however changed his vote on January 7, 2023.[41] However, in October 2023, Gaetz successfully filed a resolution to remove McCarthy from his role as speaker.[42] In April 2024, McCarthy said that Gaetz wanted to remove him as speaker to protecting himself against allegations of having had sex with a 17 year old minor.[43][44][45] Gaetz resigned from the U.S. House of Representatives on November 13, 2024 after he was nominated as United States Attorney General.[9] In November 2024, President-elect Donald Trump announced he would nominate Gaetz to serve as United States attorney general during his second administration.[8] His nomination surprised many Republicans and some did not like it.[46] After his nomination, there was controversy about Gaetz paying minors for sex along with accusations of sex trafficking.[10] Gaetz withdrew his nomination on November 21, 2024.[10] In December 2020, Gaetz announced his engagement to his girlfriend, Ginger Luckey.[47] They married in August 2021.[48] Gaetz is a Baptist.[49] In 2020, Gaetz was accused of sex trafficking and having sexual relationships with minors. After an investigation, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) decided not to charge him, although Gaetz remained under investigation of the House Ethics Committee up until his resignation.[5] In March 2021, Gaetz was being investigated for having a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl in 2019, and that investigators were examining whether he had violated federal sex trafficking laws by allegedly paying her to travel with him.[50][51] A few weeks later, Axios reported that Gaetz was \"seriously considering not seeking re-election and possibly leaving Congress early for a job at Newsmax\".[52] Former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson wrote in her memoir that Gaetz harassed her many times.[53] She wrote that during a trip to Camp David in 2020 he interrupted her meeting with Kevin McCarthy, repeatedly asking her to \"escort\" him to his room. Gaetz has said that this is not true.[54]",

                "title": "Matt Gaetz ‘regularly’ paid women for sex, including a minor, US Congress report says | Elections 2024 | EL PAÍS English",
                "content": "Former Congressman Matt Gaetz, whom Donald Trump chose as his nominee for U.S. attorney general before he was forced to withdraw tainted by scandal, “regularly” paid women in exchange for sex, including a minor under the age of 17, between 2017 and 2020 when he was a member of the House of Representatives for the State of Florida. This is the conclusion of a report by the Congressional Committee on Ethics made public on December 23, which also accuses Gaetz of violating “House Rules, state and federal laws, and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, acceptance of impermissible gifts, the provision of special favors and privileges, and obstruction of Congress [in its investigations].” Gaetz, one of Washington’s most controversial politicians, denies the allegations. He resigned from his post shortly before being appointed by Trump, hoping the report would not be made public because, he argued, the committee has no jurisdiction over former members. On Monday morning, Gaetz tried unsuccessfully to stop the report from being released. He later tweeted on X: “Giving funds to someone you are dating — that they didn’t ask for — and that isn’t “charged” for sex is now prostitution?!? There is a reason they did this to me in a Christmas Eve-Eve report and not in a courtroom of any kind where I could present evidence and challenge witnesses.” In subsequent messages, Gaetz extracts “testimony from one of the alleged ‘prostitutes,’” who denies having received money from him. The 37-page document is the result of a bipartisan investigation that has lasted nearly five years. Its release was made possible after at least one Republican joined the five Democrats on the committee in a secret vote held in early December. The Republican Party, despite Gaetz not being one of its most popular members, was opposed to the report being published, with House Speaker Mike Johnson at the forefront. Johnson also had a problem with publishing the findings about a former member of Congress, something that is highly unusual but has some precedents. The report contains dozens of pages of evidence, including text messages and financial records, travel receipts, checks, and online payments between several of the people involved. They show Gaetz, 42, inviting various women to events, on getaways to the Bahamas, or to parties. The committee, however, has found no evidence of the most serious charge: violating federal sex trafficking laws. “Although Representative Gaetz did cause the transportation of [these] women across state lines for purposes of commercial sex, the Committee did not find evidence that any of those women were under 18 at the time of travel, nor did the Committee find sufficient evidence to conclude that the commercial sex acts were induced by force, fraud, or coercion,” the brief says. The congressional inquiry was put on hold while the Justice Department conducted its own investigation. In February, after a year of work on the case, no charges were filed and the House committee took up the matter again. The report is the result of more than a dozen interviews and a review of nearly 14,000 documents. The report also tells the story of Gaetz’s friendship with Joel Greenberg, a Florida tax inspector. They met in 2017, shortly after Gaetz was sworn in at the Capitol. “Mr. Greenberg and Representative Gaetz frequently attended parties and other gatherings with young women in attendance. Many of those women were initially contacted by Mr. Greenberg via the website SeekingArrangement.com (now Seeking.com), and Mr. Greenberg subsequently introduced the women to Representative Gaetz,” it reads. That website, the committee writes, is dedicated to connecting mostly older men and young women looking for “mutually beneficial relationships.” “The website was generally understood by many of the women interviewed by the Committee to involve, at minimum, an exchange of companionship for money,” the report says. Greenberg was sentenced to 11 years in federal prison in 2022 after pleading guilty to multiple charges, including sex trafficking of a minor. Greenberg also admitted to introducing her to other “adult men.” Gaetz’s future is uncertain. Years ago, a report like the one released Monday would have meant his political demise, but in these times of fake news, and especially within the rules of the MAGA universe, it is impossible to say if his career is over. On Sunday, Gaetz hinted at a Trumpist conclave held in Phoenix, Arizona, where the president-elect was the star speaker, that he was considering running for the seat vacated by Marco Rubio in the Florida Senate. Rubio is the new administration’s pick for Secretary of State.

                "title": "China - Wikipedia",
                "content": "China,[h] officially the People's Republic of China (PRC),[i] is a country in East Asia. With a population exceeding 1.4 billion, it is the second-most populous country after India, representing 17.4% of the world population. China spans the equivalent of five time zones and borders fourteen countries by land.[j] With an area of nearly 9.6 million square kilometers (3,700,000 sq mi), it is the third-largest country by total land area.[k] The country is divided into 33 province-level divisions: 22 provinces,[l] five autonomous regions, four municipalities, and two semi-autonomous special administrative regions. Beijing is the country's capital, while Shanghai is its most populous city by urban area and largest financial center. China is considered one of the cradles of civilization: the first human inhabitants in the region arrived during the Paleolithic. By the late 2nd millennium BCE, the earliest dynastic states had emerged in the Yellow River basin. The 8th–3rd centuries BCE saw a breakdown in the authority of the Zhou dynasty, accompanied by the emergence of administrative and military techniques, literature, philosophy, and historiography. In 221 BCE, China was unified under an emperor, ushering in more than two millennia of imperial dynasties including the Qin, Han, Tang, Yuan, Ming, and Qing. With the invention of gunpowder and paper, the establishment of the Silk Road, and the building of the Great Wall, Chinese culture flourished and has heavily influenced both its neighbors and lands further afield. However, China began to cede parts of the country in the late 19th century to various European powers by a series of unequal treaties. After decades of Qing China on the decline, the 1911 Revolution overthrew the Qing dynasty and the monarchy and the Republic of China (ROC) was established the following year. The country under the nascent Beiyang government was unstable and ultimately fragmented during the Warlord Era, which was ended upon the Northern Expedition conducted by the Kuomintang (KMT) to reunify the country. The Chinese Civil War began in 1927, when KMT forces purged members of the rival Chinese Communist Party (CCP), who proceeded to engage in sporadic fighting against the KMT-led Nationalist government. Following the country's invasion by the Empire of Japan in 1937, the CCP and KMT formed the Second United Front to fight the Japanese. The Second Sino-Japanese War eventually ended in a Chinese victory; however, the CCP and the KMT resumed their civil war as soon as the war ended. In 1949, the resurgent Communists established control over most of the country, proclaiming the People's Republic of China and forcing the Nationalist government to retreat to the island of Taiwan. The country was split, with both sides claiming to be the sole legitimate government of China. Following the implementation of land reforms, further attempts by the PRC to realize communism failed: the Great Leap Forward was largely responsible for the Great Chinese Famine that ended with millions of Chinese people having died, and the subsequent Cultural Revolution was a period of social turmoil and persecution characterized by Maoist populism. Following the Sino-Soviet split, the Shanghai Communiqué in 1972 would precipitate the normalization of relations with the United States. Economic reforms that began in 1978 moved the country away from a socialist planned economy towards an increasingly capitalist market economy, spurring significant economic growth. The corresponding movement for increased democracy and liberalization stalled after the Tiananmen Square protests and massacre in 1989. China is a unitary one-party socialist republic led by the CCP. It is one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council; the UN representative for China was changed from the ROC to the PRC in 1971. It is a founding member of several multilateral and regional organizations such as the AIIB, the Silk Road Fund, the New Development Bank, and the RCEP. It is a member of the BRICS, the G20, APEC, the SCO, and the East Asia Summit. Making up around one-fifth of the world economy, the Chinese economy is the world's largest economy by PPP-adjusted GDP, the second-largest economy by nominal GDP, and the second-wealthiest country, albeit ranking poorly in measures of democracy, human rights and religious freedom. The country has been one of the fastest-growing major economies and is the world's largest manufacturer and exporter, as well as the second-largest importer. China is a nuclear-weapon state with the world's largest standing army by military personnel and the second-largest defense budget. It is a great power, and has been described as an emerging superpower. China is known for its cuisine and culture, and has 59 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the second-highest number of any country. The word \"China\" has been used in English since the 16th century; however, it was not used by the Chinese themselves during this period. Its origin has been traced through Portuguese, Malay, and Persian back to the Sanskrit word Cīna, used in ancient India.[16] \"China\" appears in Richard Eden's 1555 translation[m] of the 1516 journal of the Portuguese explorer Duarte Barbosa.[n][16] Barbosa's usage was derived from Persian Chīn (چین), which in turn derived from Sanskrit Cīna (चीन).[21] Cīna was first used in early Hindu scripture, including the Mahabharata (5th century BCE) and the Laws of Manu (2nd century BCE).[22] In 1655, Martino Martini suggested that the word China is derived ultimately from the name of the Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE).[23][22] Although use in Indian sources precedes this dynasty, this derivation is still given in various sources.[24] The origin of the Sanskrit word is a matter of debate.[16] Alternative suggestions include the names for Yelang and the Jing or Chu state.[22][25] The official name of the modern state is the \"People's Republic of China\" (simplified Chinese: 中华人民共和国; traditional Chinese: 中華人民共和國; pinyin: Zhōnghuá rénmín gònghéguó). The shorter form is \"China\" (中国; 中國; Zhōngguó), from zhōng ('central') and guó ('state'), a term which developed under the Western Zhou dynasty in reference to its royal demesne.[o][p] It was used in official documents as an synonym for the state under the Qing.[28] The name Zhongguo is also translated as 'Middle Kingdom' in English.[29] China is sometimes referred to as \"mainland China\" or \"the Mainland\" when distinguishing it from the Republic of China or the PRC's Special Administrative Regions.[30][31][32][33] Archaeological evidence suggests that early hominids inhabited China 2.25 million years ago.[34] The hominid fossils of Peking Man, a Homo erectus who used fire,[35] have been dated to between 680,000 and 780,000 years ago.[36] The fossilized teeth of Homo sapiens (dated to 125,000–80,000 years ago) have been discovered in Fuyan Cave.[37] Chinese proto-writing existed in Jiahu around 6600 BCE,[38] at Damaidi around 6000 BCE,[39] Dadiwan from 5800 to 5400 BCE, and Banpo dating from the 5th millennium BCE. Some scholars have suggested that the Jiahu symbols (7th millennium BCE) constituted the earliest Chinese writing system.[38] According to traditional Chinese historiography, the Xia dynasty was established during the late 3rd millennium BCE, marking the beginning of the dynastic cycle that was understood to underpin China's entire political history. In the modern era, the Xia's historicity came under increasing scrutiny, in part due to the earliest known attestation of the Xia being written millennia after the date given for their collapse. In 1958, archaeologists discovered sites belonging to the Erlitou culture that existed during the early Bronze Age; they have since been characterized as the remains of the historical Xia, but this conception is often rejected.[40][41][42] The Shang dynasty that traditionally succeeded the Xia is the earliest for which there are both contemporary written records and undisputed archaeological evidence.[43] The Shang ruled much of the Yellow River valley until the 11th century BCE, with the earliest hard evidence dated c. 1300 BCE.[44] The oracle bone script, attested from c. 1250 BCE but generally assumed to be considerably older,[45][46] represents the oldest known form of written Chinese,[47] and is the direct ancestor of modern Chinese characters.[48] The Shang were overthrown by the Zhou, who ruled between the 11th and 5th centuries BCE, though the centralized authority of Son of Heaven was slowly eroded by fengjian lords. Some principalities eventually emerged from the weakened Zhou and continually waged war with each other during the 300-year Spring and Autumn period. By the time of the Warring States period of the 5th–3rd centuries BCE, there were seven major powerful states left.[49] The Warring States period ended in 221 BCE after the state of Qin conquered the other six states, reunited China and established the dominant order of autocracy. King Zheng of Qin proclaimed himself the Emperor of the Qin dynasty, becoming the first emperor of a unified China. He enacted Qin's legalist reforms, notably the standardization of Chinese characters, measurements, road widths, and currency. His dynasty also conquered the Yue tribes in Guangxi, Guangdong, and Northern Vietnam.[50] The Qin dynasty lasted only fifteen years, falling soon after the First Emperor's death.[51][52] Following widespread revolts during which the imperial library was burned,[q] the Han dynasty emerged to rule China between 206 BCE and 220 CE, creating a cultural identity among its populace still remembered in the ethnonym of the modern Han Chinese.[51][52] The Han expanded the empire's territory considerably, with military campaigns reaching Central Asia, Mongolia, Korea, and Yunnan, and the recovery of Guangdong and northern Vietnam from Nanyue. Han involvement in Central Asia and Sogdia helped establish the land route of the Silk Road, replacing the earlier path over the Himalayas to India. Han China gradually became the largest economy of the ancient world.[54] Despite the Han's initial decentralization and the official abandonment of the Qin philosophy of Legalism in favor of Confucianism, Qin's legalist institutions and policies continued to be employed by the Han government and its successors.[55] After the end of the Han dynasty, a period of strife known as Three Kingdoms followed, at the end of which Wei was swiftly overthrown by the Jin dynasty. The Jin fell to civil war upon the ascension of a developmentally disabled emperor; the Five Barbarians then rebelled and ruled northern China as the Sixteen States. The Xianbei unified them as the Northern Wei, whose Emperor Xiaowen reversed his predecessors' apartheid policies and enforced a drastic sinification on his subjects. In the south, the general Liu Yu secured the abdication of the Jin in favor of the Liu Song. The various successors of these states became known as the Northern and Southern dynasties, with the two areas finally reunited by the Sui in 581.[citation needed] The Sui restored the Han to power through China, reformed its agriculture, economy and imperial examination system, constructed the Grand Canal, and patronized Buddhism. However, they fell quickly when their conscription for public works and a failed war in northern Korea provoked widespread unrest.[56][57] Under the succeeding Tang and Song dynasties, Chinese economy, technology, and culture entered a golden age.[58] The Tang dynasty retained control of the Western Regions and the Silk Road,[59] which brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa,[60] and made the capital Chang'an a cosmopolitan urban center. However, it was devastated and weakened by the An Lushan rebellion in the 8th century.[61] In 907, the Tang disintegrated completely when the local military governors became ungovernable. The Song dynasty ended the separatist situation in 960, leading to a balance of power between the Song and the Liao dynasty. The Song was the first government in world history to issue paper money and the first Chinese polity to establish a permanent navy which was supported by the developed shipbuilding industry along with the sea trade.[62] Between the 10th and 11th century CE, the population of China doubled to around 100 million people, mostly because of the expansion of rice cultivation in central and southern China, and the production of abundant food surpluses. The Song dynasty also saw a revival of Confucianism, in response to the growth of Buddhism during the Tang,[63] and a flourishing of philosophy and the arts, as landscape art and porcelain were brought to new levels of complexity.[64] However, the military weakness of the Song army was observed by the Jin dynasty. In 1127, Emperor Emeritus Huizong, Emperor Qinzong of Song and the capital Bianjing were captured during the Jin–Song wars. The remnants of the Song retreated to southern China and reestablished the Song at Jiankang.[65] The Mongol conquest of China began in 1205 with the campaigns against Western Xia by Genghis Khan,[66] who also invaded Jin territories.[67] In 1271, the Mongol leader Kublai Khan established the Yuan dynasty, which conquered the last remnant of the Song dynasty in 1279. Before the Mongol invasion, the population of Song China was 120 million citizens; this was reduced to 60 million by the time of the census in 1300.[68] A peasant named Zhu Yuanzhang overthrew the Yuan in 1368 and founded the Ming dynasty as the Hongwu Emperor. Under the Ming dynasty, China enjoyed another golden age, developing one of the strongest navies in the world and a rich and prosperous economy amid a flourishing of art and culture. It was during this period that admiral Zheng He led the Ming treasure voyages throughout the Indian Ocean, reaching as far as East Africa.[69] In the early Ming dynasty, China's capital was moved from Nanjing to Beijing. With the budding of capitalism, philosophers such as Wang Yangming critiqued and expanded Neo-Confucianism with concepts of individualism and equality of four occupations.[70] The scholar-official stratum became a supporting force of industry and commerce in the tax boycott movements, which, together with the famines and defense against Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598) and Later Jin incursions led to an exhausted treasury.[71] In 1644, Beijing was captured by a coalition of peasant rebel forces led by Li Zicheng. The Chongzhen Emperor committed suicide when the city fell. The Manchu Qing dynasty, then allied with Ming dynasty general Wu Sangui, overthrew Li's short-lived Shun dynasty and subsequently seized control of Beijing, which became the new capital of the Qing dynasty.[72] The Qing dynasty, which lasted from 1644 until 1912, was the last imperial dynasty of China. The Ming-Qing transition (1618–1683) cost 25 million lives, but the Qing appeared to have restored China's imperial power and inaugurated another flowering of the arts.[73] After the Southern Ming ended, the further conquest of the Dzungar Khanate added Mongolia, Tibet and Xinjiang to the empire.[74] Meanwhile, China's population growth resumed and shortly began to accelerate. It is commonly agreed that pre-modern China's population experienced two growth spurts, one during the Northern Song period (960–1127), and other during the Qing period (around 1700–1830).[75] By the High Qing era China was possibly the most commercialized country in the world, and imperial China experienced a second commercial revolution by the end of the 18th century.[76] On the other hand, the centralized autocracy was strengthened in part to suppress anti-Qing sentiment with the policy of valuing agriculture and restraining commerce, like the Haijin during the early Qing period and ideological control as represented by the literary inquisition, causing some social and technological stagnation.[77][78] In the mid-19th century, the Opium Wars with Britain and France forced China to pay compensation, open treaty ports, allow extraterritoriality for foreign nationals, and cede Hong Kong to the British[79] under the 1842 Treaty of Nanking, the first of what have been termed as the \"unequal treaties\". The First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895) resulted in Qing China's loss of influence in the Korean Peninsula, as well as the cession of Taiwan to Japan.[80] The Qing dynasty also began experiencing internal unrest in which tens of millions of people died, especially in the White Lotus Rebellion, the failed Taiping Rebellion that ravaged southern China in the 1850s and 1860s and the Dungan Revolt (1862–1877) in the northwest. The initial success of the Self-Strengthening Movement of the 1860s was frustrated by a series of military defeats in the 1880s and 1890s.[81] In the 19th century, the great Chinese diaspora began. Losses due to emigration were added to by conflicts and catastrophes such as the Northern Chinese Famine of 1876–1879, in which between 9 and 13 million people died.[82] The Guangxu Emperor drafted a reform plan in 1898 to establish a modern constitutional monarchy, but these plans were thwarted by the Empress Dowager Cixi. The ill-fated anti-foreign Boxer Rebellion of 1899–1901 further weakened the dynasty. Although Cixi sponsored a program of reforms known as the late Qing reforms, the Xinhai Revolution of 1911–1912 ended the Qing dynasty and established the Republic of China.[83] Puyi, the last Emperor, abdicated in 1912.[84] On 1 January 1912, the Republic of China was established, and Sun Yat-sen of the Kuomintang (KMT) was proclaimed provisional president.[85] In March 1912, the presidency was given to Yuan Shikai, a former Qing general who in 1915 proclaimed himself Emperor of China. In the face of popular condemnation and opposition from his own Beiyang Army, he was forced to abdicate and re-establish the republic in 1916.[86] After Yuan Shikai's death in 1916, China was politically fragmented. Its Beijing-based government was internationally recognized but virtually powerless; regional warlords controlled most of its territory.[87][88] During this period, China participated in World War I and saw a far-reaching popular uprising (the May Fourth Movement).[89] In the late 1920s, the Kuomintang under Chiang Kai-shek was able to reunify the country under its own control with a series of deft military and political maneuverings known collectively as the Northern Expedition.[90][91] The Kuomintang moved the nation's capital to Nanjing and implemented \"political tutelage\", an intermediate stage of political development outlined in Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People program for transforming China into a modern democratic state.[92][93] The Kuomintang briefly allied with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) during the Northern Expedition, though the alliance broke down in 1927 after Chiang violently suppressed the CCP and other leftists in Shanghai, marking the beginning of the Chinese Civil War.[94] The CCP declared areas of the country as the Chinese Soviet Republic (Jiangxi Soviet) in November 1931 in Ruijin, Jiangxi. The Jiangxi Soviet was wiped out by the KMT armies in 1934, leading the CCP to initiate the Long March and relocate to Yan'an in Shaanxi. It would be the base of the communists before major combat in the Chinese Civil War ended in 1949. In 1931, Japan invaded and occupied Manchuria. Japan invaded other parts of China in 1937, precipitating the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945), a theater of World War II. The war forced an uneasy alliance between the Kuomintang and the CCP. Japanese forces committed numerous war atrocities against the civilian population; as many as 20 million Chinese civilians died.[95] An estimated 40,000 to 300,000 Chinese were massacred in Nanjing alone during the Japanese occupation.[96] China, along with the UK, the United States, and the Soviet Union, were recognized as the Allied \"Big Four\" in the Declaration by United Nations.[97][98] Along with the other three great powers, China was one of the four major Allies of World War II, and was later considered one of the primary victors in the war.[99][100] After the surrender of Japan in 1945, Taiwan, including the Penghu, was handed over to Chinese control; however, the validity of this handover is controversial.[101] China emerged victorious but war-ravaged and financially drained. The continued distrust between the Kuomintang and the Communists led to the resumption of civil war. Constitutional rule was established in 1947, but because of the ongoing unrest, many provisions of the ROC constitution were never implemented in mainland China.[101] Afterwards, the CCP took control of most of mainland China, and the ROC government retreated offshore to Taiwan. On 1 October 1949, CCP Chairman Mao Zedong formally proclaimed the People's Republic of China in Tiananmen Square, Beijing.[103] In 1950, the PRC captured Hainan from the ROC[104] and annexed Tibet.[105] However, remaining Kuomintang forces continued to wage an insurgency in western China throughout the 1950s.[106] The CCP consolidated its popularity among the peasants through the Land Reform Movement, which included the state-tolerated executions of between 1 and 2 million landlords by peasants and former tenants.[107] Though the PRC initially allied closely with the Soviet Union, the relations between the two communist nations gradually deteriorated, leading China to develop an independent industrial system and its own nuclear weapons.[108] The Chinese population increased from 550 million in 1950 to 900 million in 1974.[109] However, the Great Leap Forward, an idealistic massive industrialization project, resulted in an estimated 15 to 55 million deaths between 1959 and 1961, mostly from starvation.[110][111] In 1964, China detonated its first atomic bomb.[112] In 1966, Mao and his allies launched the Cultural Revolution, sparking a decade of political recrimination and social upheaval that lasted until Mao's death in 1976. In October 1971, the PRC replaced the ROC in the United Nations, and took its seat as a permanent member of the Security Council.[113] After Mao's death, the Gang of Four was arrested by Hua Guofeng and held responsible for the Cultural Revolution. The Cultural Revolution was rebuked, with millions rehabilitated. Deng Xiaoping took power in 1978, and instituted large-scale political and economic reforms, together with the \"Eight Elders\", most senior and influential members of the party. The government loosened its control and the communes were gradually disbanded.[114] Agricultural collectivization was dismantled and farmlands privatized. While foreign trade became a major focus, special economic zones (SEZs) were created. Inefficient state-owned enterprises (SOEs) were restructured and some closed. This marked China's transition away from planned economy.[115] China adopted its current constitution on 4 December 1982.[116] In 1989, there were protests such those in Tiananmen Square, and then throughout the entire nation.[117] Zhao Ziyang was put under house arrest for his sympathies to the protests and was replaced by Jiang Zemin. Jiang continued economic reforms, closing many SOEs and trimming down \"iron rice bowl\" (life-tenure positions).[118][119][120] China's economy grew sevenfold during this time.[118] British Hong Kong and Portuguese Macau returned to China in 1997 and 1999, respectively, as special administrative regions under the principle of one country, two systems. The country joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.[118] At the 16th CCP National Congress in 2002, Hu Jintao succeeded Jiang as the general secretary.[118] Under Hu, China maintained its high rate of economic growth, overtaking the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Japan to become the world's second-largest economy.[121] However, the growth also severely impacted the country's resources and environment,[122][123] and caused major social displacement.[124][125] Xi Jinping succeeded Hu as paramount leader at the 18th CCP National Congress in 2012. Shortly after his ascension to power, Xi launched a vast anti-corruption crackdown,[126] that prosecuted more than 2 million officials by 2022.[127] During his tenure, Xi has consolidated power unseen since the initiation of economic and political reforms.[128] China's landscape is vast and diverse, ranging from the Gobi and Taklamakan Deserts in the arid north to the subtropical forests in the wetter south. The Himalaya, Karakoram, Pamir and Tian Shan mountain ranges separate China from much of South and Central Asia. The Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, the third- and sixth-longest in the world, respectively, run from the Tibetan Plateau to the densely populated eastern seaboard. China's coastline along the Pacific Ocean is 14,500 km (9,000 mi) long and is bounded by the Bohai, Yellow, East China and South China seas. China connects through the Kazakh border to the Eurasian Steppe. The territory of China lies between latitudes 18° and 54° N, and longitudes 73° and 135° E. The geographical center of China is marked by the Center of the Country Monument at 35°50′40.9″N 103°27′7.5″E﻿ / ﻿35.844694°N 103.452083°E﻿ / 35.844694; 103.452083﻿ (Geographical center of China). China's landscapes vary significantly across its vast territory. In the east, along the shores of the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea, there are extensive and densely populated alluvial plains, while on the edges of the Inner Mongolian plateau in the north, broad grasslands predominate. Southern China is dominated by hills and low mountain ranges, while the central-east hosts the deltas of China's two major rivers, the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. Other major rivers include the Xi, Mekong, Brahmaputra and Amur. To the west sit major mountain ranges, most notably the Himalayas. High plateaus feature among the more arid landscapes of the north, such as the Taklamakan and the Gobi Desert. The world's highest point, Mount Everest (8,848 m), lies on the Sino-Nepalese border.[129] The country's lowest point, and the world's third-lowest, is the dried lake bed of Ayding Lake (−154 m) in the Turpan Depression.[130] China's climate is mainly dominated by dry seasons and wet monsoons, which lead to pronounced temperature differences between winter and summer. In the winter, northern winds coming from high-latitude areas are cold and dry; in summer, southern winds from coastal areas at lower latitudes are warm and moist.[132] A major environmental issue in China is the continued expansion of its deserts, particularly the Gobi Desert.[133][134] Although barrier tree lines planted since the 1970s have reduced the frequency of sandstorms, prolonged drought and poor agricultural practices have resulted in dust storms plaguing northern China each spring, which then spread to other parts of East Asia, including Japan and Korea. Water quality, erosion, and pollution control have become important issues in China's relations with other countries. Melting glaciers in the Himalayas could potentially lead to water shortages for hundreds of millions of people.[135] According to academics, in order to limit climate change in China to 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) electricity generation from coal in China without carbon capture must be phased out by 2045.[136] With current policies, the GHG emissions of China will probably peak in 2025, and by 2030 they will return to 2022 levels. However, such pathway still leads to three-degree temperature rise.[137] Official government statistics about Chinese agricultural productivity are considered unreliable, due to exaggeration of production at subsidiary government levels.[138][139] Much of China has a climate very suitable for agriculture and the country has been the world's largest producer of rice, wheat, tomatoes, eggplant, grapes, watermelon, spinach, and many other crops.[140] In 2021, 12 percent of global permanent meadows and pastures belonged to China, as well as 8% of global cropland.[141] China is one of 17 megadiverse countries,[142] lying in two of the world's major biogeographic realms: the Palearctic and the Indomalayan. By one measure, China has over 34,687 species of animals and vascular plants, making it the third-most biodiverse country in the world, after Brazil and Colombia.[143] The country is a party to the Convention on Biological Diversity;[144] its National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan was received by the convention in 2010.[145] China is home to at least 551 species of mammals (the third-highest in the world),[146] 1,221 species of birds (eighth),[147] 424 species of reptiles (seventh)[148] and 333 species of amphibians (seventh).[149] Wildlife in China shares habitat with, and bears acute pressure from, one of the world's largest population of humans. At least 840 animal species are threatened, vulnerable or in danger of local extinction, due mainly to human activity such as habitat destruction, pollution and poaching for food, fur and traditional Chinese medicine.[150] Endangered wildlife is protected by law, and as of 2005[update], the country has over 2,349 nature reserves, covering a total area of 149.95 million hectares, 15 percent of China's total land area.[151] Most wild animals have been eliminated from the core agricultural regions of east and central China, but they have fared better in the mountainous south and west.[152][153] The Baiji was confirmed extinct on 12 December 2006.[154] China has over 32,000 species of vascular plants,[155] and is home to a variety of forest types. Cold coniferous forests predominate in the north of the country, supporting animal species such as moose and Asian black bear, along with over 120 bird species.[156] The understory of moist conifer forests may contain thickets of bamboo. In higher montane stands of juniper and yew, the bamboo is replaced by rhododendrons. Subtropical forests, which are predominate in central and southern China, support a high density of plant species including numerous rare endemics. Tropical and seasonal rainforests, though confined to Yunnan and Hainan, contain a quarter of all the animal and plant species found in China.[156] China has over 10,000 recorded species of fungi.[157] In the early 2000s, China has suffered from environmental deterioration and pollution due to its rapid pace of industrialization.[158][159] Regulations such as the 1979 Environmental Protection Law are fairly stringent, though they are poorly enforced, frequently disregarded in favor of rapid economic development.[160] China has the second-highest death toll because of air pollution, after India, with approximately 1 million deaths.[161][162] Although China ranks as the highest CO2 emitting country,[163] it only emits 8 tons of CO2 per capita, significantly lower than developed countries such as the United States (16.1), Australia (16.8) and South Korea (13.6).[164] Greenhouse gas emissions by China are the world's largest.[164] The country has significant water pollution problems; only 89.4% of China's national surface water was graded suitable for human consumption by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment in 2023.[165] China has prioritized clamping down on pollution, bringing a significant decrease in air pollution in the 2010s.[166] In 2020, the Chinese government announced its aims for the country to reach its peak emissions levels before 2030, and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 in line with the Paris Agreement,[167] which, according to Climate Action Tracker, would lower the expected rise in global temperature by 0.2–0.3 degrees – \"the biggest single reduction ever estimated by the Climate Action Tracker\".[167] China is the world's leading investor in renewable energy and its commercialization, with $546 billion invested in 2022;[168] it is a major manufacturer of renewable energy technologies and invests heavily in local-scale renewable energy projects.[169][168] Long heavily relying on non-renewable energy sources such as coal, China's adaptation of renewable energy has increased significantly in recent years, with their share increasing from 26.3 percent in 2016 to 31.9 percent in 2022.[170] In 2023, 60.5% of China's electricity came from coal (largest producer in the world), 13.2% from hydroelectric power (largest), 9.4% from wind (largest), 6.2% from solar energy (largest), 4.6% from nuclear energy (second-largest), 3.3% from natural gas (fifth-largest), and 2.2% from bioenergy (largest); in total, 31% of China's energy came from renewable energy sources.[171] Despite its emphasis on renewables, China remains deeply connected to global oil markets and next to India, has been the largest importer of Russian crude oil in 2022.[172][173] According to China's government, the forest coverage of the country grew from 10% of the overall territory in 1949 to 25% in 2024.[174] China is the third-largest country in the world by land area after Russia, and the third- or fourth-largest country in the world by total area.[r] China's total area is generally stated as being approximately 9,600,000 km2 (3,700,000 sq mi).[175] Specific area figures range from 9,572,900 km2 (3,696,100 sq mi) according to the Encyclopædia Britannica,[14] to 9,596,961 km2 (3,705,407 sq mi) according to the UN Demographic Yearbook,[6] and The World Factbook.[5] China has the longest combined land border in the world, measuring 22,117 km (13,743 mi) and its coastline covers approximately 14,500 km (9,000 mi) from the mouth of the Yalu River (Amnok River) to the Gulf of Tonkin.[5] China borders 14 nations and covers the bulk of East Asia, bordering Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar in Southeast Asia; India, Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan[s] and Afghanistan in South Asia; Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan in Central Asia; and Russia, Mongolia, and North Korea in Inner Asia and Northeast Asia. It is narrowly separated from Bangladesh and Thailand to the southwest and south, and has several maritime neighbors such as Japan, Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia.[176] China has resolved its land borders with 12 out of 14 neighboring countries, having pursued substantial compromises in most of them.[177][178][179] China currently has a disputed land border with India[180] and Bhutan.[181] China is additionally involved in maritime disputes with multiple countries over territory in the East and South China Seas, such as the Senkaku Islands and the entirety of South China Sea Islands.[182][183] The People's Republic of China is a one-party state governed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The CCP is officially guided by socialism with Chinese characteristics, which is Marxism adapted to Chinese circumstances.[184] The Chinese constitution states that the PRC \"is a socialist state governed by a people's democratic dictatorship that is led by the working class and based on an alliance of workers and peasants,\" that the state institutions \"shall practice the principle of democratic centralism,\"[185] and that \"the defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.\"[186] The PRC officially terms itself as a democracy, using terms such as \"socialist consultative democracy\",[187] and \"whole-process people's democracy\".[188] However, the country is commonly described as an authoritarian one-party state and a dictatorship,[189][190] with among the heaviest restrictions worldwide in many areas, most notably against freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, free formation of social organizations, freedom of religion and free access to the Internet.[191] China has consistently been ranked amongst the lowest as an \"authoritarian regime\" by the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index, ranking at 148th out of 167 countries in 2023.[192] Other sources suggest that terming China as \"authoritarian\" does not sufficiently account for the multiple consultation mechanisms that exist in Chinese government.[193] According to the CCP constitution, its highest body is the National Congress held every five years.[194] The National Congress elects the Central Committee, who then elects the party's Politburo, Politburo Standing Committee and the general secretary (party leader), the top leadership of the country.[194] The general secretary holds ultimate power and authority over party and state and serves as the informal paramount leader.[195] The current general secretary is Xi Jinping, who took office on 15 November 2012.[196] At the local level, the secretary of the CCP committee of a subdivision outranks the local government level; CCP committee secretary of a provincial division outranks the governor while the CCP committee secretary of a city outranks the mayor.[197] The government in China is under the sole control of the CCP.[198] The CCP controls appointments in government bodies, with most senior government officials being CCP members.[198] The National People's Congress (NPC), with nearly 3,000-members, is constitutionally the \"highest organ of state power\",[185] though it has been also described as a \"rubber stamp\" body.[199] The NPC meets annually, while the NPC Standing Committee, around 150 members elected from NPC delegates, meets every couple of months.[199] Elections are indirect and not pluralistic, with nominations at all levels being controlled by the CCP.[188] The NPC is dominated by the CCP, with another eight minor parties having nominal representation under the condition of upholding CCP leadership.[200] The president is elected by the NPC. The presidency is the ceremonial state representative, but not the constitutional head of state. The incumbent president is Xi Jinping, who is also the general secretary of the CCP and the chairman of the Central Military Commission, making him China's paramount leader and supreme commander of the Armed Forces. The premier is the head of government, with Li Qiang being the incumbent. The premier is officially nominated by the president and then elected by the NPC, and has generally been either the second- or third-ranking member of the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC). The premier presides over the State Council, China's cabinet, composed of four vice premiers, state councilors, and the heads of ministries and commissions.[185] The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) is a political advisory body that is critical in China's \"united front\" system, which aims to gather non-CCP voices to support the CCP. Similar to the people's congresses, CPPCC's exist at various division, with the National Committee of the CPPCC being chaired by Wang Huning, fourth-ranking member of the PSC.[201] The governance of China is characterized by a high degree of political centralization but significant economic decentralization.[202]: 7 Policy instruments or processes are often tested locally before being applied more widely, resulting in a policy that involves experimentation and feedback.[203]: 14 Generally, central government leadership refrains from drafting specific policies, instead using the informal networks and site visits to affirm or suggest changes to the direction of local policy experiments or pilot programs.[204]: 71 The typical approach is that central government leadership begins drafting formal policies, law, or regulations after policy has been developed at local levels.[204]: 71 The PRC is constitutionally a unitary state divided into 23 provinces,[t] five autonomous regions (each with a designated minority group), and four direct-administered municipalities—collectively referred to as \"mainland China\"—as well as the special administrative regions (SARs) of Hong Kong and Macau.[205] The PRC regards the island of Taiwan as its Taiwan Province, Kinmen and Matsu as a part of Fujian Province and islands the ROC controls in the South China Sea as a part of Hainan Province and Guangdong Province, although all these territories are governed by the Republic of China (ROC).[206][33] Geographically, all 31 provincial divisions of mainland China can be grouped into six regions: North China, East China, Southwestern China, South Central China, Northeast China, and Northwestern China.[207] Taiwan (台湾省), governed by the Republic of China The PRC has diplomatic relations with 179 United Nation members states and maintains embassies in 174. As of 2024[update], China has one of the largest diplomatic networks of any country in the world.[208] In 1971, the PRC replaced the Republic of China (ROC) as the sole representative of China in the United Nations and as one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.[209] It is a member of intergovernmental organizations including the G20,[210] the SCO,[211] the BRICS,[212] the East Asia Summit,[213] and the APEC.[214] China was also a former member and leader of the Non-Aligned Movement, and still considers itself an advocate for developing countries.[215] The PRC officially maintains the one-China principle, which holds the view that there is only one sovereign state in the name of China, represented by the PRC, and that Taiwan is part of that China.[216] The unique status of Taiwan has led to countries recognizing the PRC to maintain unique \"one-China policies\" that differ from each other; some countries explicitly recognize the PRC's claim over Taiwan, while others, including the U.S. and Japan, only acknowledge the claim.[216] Chinese officials have protested on numerous occasions when foreign countries have made diplomatic overtures to Taiwan,[217] especially in the matter of armament sales.[218] Most countries have switched recognition from the ROC to the PRC since the latter replaced the former in the UN in 1971.[219] Much of current Chinese foreign policy is reportedly based on Premier Zhou Enlai's Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and is also driven by the concept of \"harmony without uniformity\", which encourages diplomatic relations between states despite ideological differences.[220] This policy may have led China to support or maintain close ties with states that are regarded as dangerous and repressive by Western nations, such as Sudan,[221] North Korea and Iran.[222] China's close relationship with Myanmar has involved support for its ruling governments as well as for its ethnic rebel groups,[223] including the Arakan Army.[224] China has a close political, economic and military relationship with Russia,[225] and the two states often vote in unison in the UN Security Council.[226][227][228] China's relationship with the United States is complex, and includes deep trade ties but significant political differences.[229] Since the early 2000s, China has followed a policy of engaging with African nations for trade and bilateral co-operation.[230][231][232] It maintains extensive and highly diversified trade links with the European Union, and became its largest trading partner for goods.[233] China is increasing its influence in Central Asia[234] and South Pacific.[235] The country has strong trade ties with ASEAN countries[236] and major South American economies,[237] and is the largest trading partner of Brazil, Chile, Peru, Uruguay, Argentina, and several others.[238] In 2013, China initiated the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a large global infrastructure building initiative with funding on the order of $50–100 billion per year.[239] BRI could be one of the largest development plans in modern history.[240] It expanded significantly over the next six years and, as of April 2020[update], included 138 countries and 30 international organizations. In addition to intensifying foreign policy relations, the focus is particularly on building efficient transport routes, especially the maritime Silk Road with its connections to East Africa and Europe. However many loans made under the program are unsustainable and China has faced a number of calls for debt relief from debtor nations.[241][242] The People's Liberation Army (PLA) is considered one of the world's most powerful militaries and has rapidly modernized in the recent decades.[243] It has also been accused of technology theft by some countries.[244][245][246] Since 2024, it consists of four services: the Ground Force (PLAGF), the Navy (PLAN), the Air Force (PLAAF) and the Rocket Force (PLARF). It also has four independent arms: the Aerospace Force, the Cyberspace Force, the Information Support Force, and the Joint Logistics Support Force, the first three of which were split from the disbanded Strategic Support Force (PLASSF).[247] Its nearly 2.2 million active duty personnel is the largest in the world. The PLA holds the world's third-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons,[248][249] and the world's second-largest navy by tonnage.[250] China's official military budget for 2023 totalled US$224 billion (1.55 trillion Yuan), the second-largest in the world, though SIPRI estimates that its real expenditure that year was US$296 billion, making up 12% of global military spending and accounting for 1.7% of the country's GDP.[251] According to SIPRI, its military spending from 2012 to 2021 averaged US$215 billion per year or 1.7 per cent of GDP, behind only the United States at US$734 billion per year or 3.6 per cent of GDP.[252] The PLA is commanded by the Central Military Commission (CMC) of the party and the state; though officially two separate organizations, the two CMCs have identical membership except during leadership transition periods and effectively function as one organization. The chairman of the CMC is the commander-in-chief of the PLA.[253] The situation of human rights in China has attracted significant criticism from foreign governments, foreign press agencies, and non-governmental organizations, alleging widespread civil rights violations such as detention without trial, forced confessions, torture, restrictions of fundamental rights, and excessive use of the death penalty.[191][254] Since its inception, Freedom House has ranked China as \"not free\" in its Freedom in the World survey,[191] while Amnesty International has documented significant human rights abuses.[254] The Chinese constitution states that the \"fundamental rights\" of citizens include freedom of speech, freedom of the press, the right to a fair trial, freedom of religion, universal suffrage, and property rights. However, in practice, these provisions do not afford significant protection against criminal prosecution by the state.[255][256] China has limited protections regarding LGBT rights.[257] Although some criticisms of government policies and the ruling CCP are tolerated, censorship of political speech and information are amongst the harshest in the world and routinely used to prevent collective action.[258] China also has the most comprehensive and sophisticated Internet censorship regime in the world, with numerous websites being blocked.[259] The government suppresses popular protests and demonstrations that it considers a potential threat to \"social stability\".[260] China additionally uses a massive espionage network of cameras, facial recognition software, sensors, and surveillance of personal technology as a means of social control of persons living in the country.[261] China is regularly accused of large-scale repression and human rights abuses in Tibet and Xinjiang,[263][264][265] where significant numbers of ethnic minorities reside, including violent police crackdowns and religious suppression.[266][267] Since 2017, the Chinese government has been engaged in a harsh crackdown in Xinjiang, with around one million Uyghurs and other ethnic and religion minorities being detained in internment camps aimed at changing the political thinking of detainees, their identities, and their religious beliefs.[268] According to Western reports, political indoctrination, torture, physical and psychological abuse, forced sterilization, sexual abuse, and forced labor are common in these facilities.[269] According to a 2020 Foreign Policy report, China's treatment of Uyghurs meets the UN definition of genocide,[270] while a separate UN Human Rights Office report said they could potentially meet the definitions for crimes against humanity.[271] The Chinese authorities have also cracked down on dissent in Hong Kong, especially after the passage of a national security law in 2020.[272] In 2017 and 2020, the Pew Research Center ranked the severity of Chinese government restrictions on religion as being among the world's highest, despite ranking religious-related social hostilities in China as low in severity.[273][274] The Global Slavery Index estimated that in 2016 more than 3.8 million people (0.25% of the population) were living in \"conditions of modern slavery\", including victims of human trafficking, forced labor, forced marriage, child labor, and state-imposed forced labor. The state-imposed re-education through labor (laojiao) system was formally abolished in 2013, but it is not clear to what extent its practices have stopped.[275] The much larger reform through labor (laogai) system includes labor prison factories, detention centers, and re-education camps; the Laogai Research Foundation has estimated in June 2008 that there were nearly 1,422 of these facilities, though it cautioned that this number was likely an underestimate.[276] Political concerns in China include the growing gap between rich and poor and government corruption.[277] Nonetheless, international surveys show the Chinese public have a high level of satisfaction with their government.[202]: 137 These views are generally attributed to the material comforts and security available to large segments of the Chinese populace as well as the government's attentiveness and responsiveness.[202] : 136 According to the World Values Survey (2022), 91% of Chinese respondents have significant confidence in their government.[202]: 13 A Harvard University survey published in July 2020 found that citizen satisfaction with the government had increased since 2003, also rating China's government as more effective and capable than ever in the survey's history.[278] China has the world's second-largest economy in terms of nominal GDP,[279] and the world's largest in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP).[280] As of 2022[update], China accounts for around 18% of the global economy by nominal GDP.[281] China is one of the world's fastest-growing major economies,[282] with its economic growth having been almost consistently above 6 percent since the introduction of economic reforms in 1978.[283] According to the World Bank, China's GDP grew from $150 billion in 1978 to $17.96 trillion by 2022.[284] It ranks at 64th at nominal GDP per capita, making it an upper-middle income country.[285] Of the world's 500 largest companies, 135 are headquartered in China.[286] As of at least 2024, China has the world's second-largest equity markets and futures markets, as well as the third-largest bond market.[287]: 153 China was one of the world's foremost economic powers throughout the arc of East Asian and global history. The country had one of the largest economies in the world for most of the past two millennia,[288] during which it has seen cycles of prosperity and decline.[54][289] Since economic reforms began in 1978, China has developed into a highly diversified economy and one of the most consequential players in international trade. Major sectors of competitive strength include manufacturing, retail, mining, steel, textiles, automobiles, energy generation, green energy, banking, electronics, telecommunications, real estate, e-commerce, and tourism. China has three out of the ten largest stock exchanges in the world[290]—Shanghai, Hong Kong and Shenzhen—that together have a market capitalization of over $15.9 trillion, as of October 2020[update].[291] China has three (Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Shenzhen) out of the world's top ten most competitive financial centers according to the 2024 Global Financial Centres Index.[292] Modern-day China is often described as an example of state capitalism or party-state capitalism.[294][295] The state dominates in strategic \"pillar\" sectors such as energy production and heavy industries, but private enterprise has expanded enormously, with around 30 million private businesses recorded in 2008.[296][297][298] According to official statistics, privately owned companies constitute more than 60% of China's GDP.[299] China has been the world's largest manufacturing nation since 2010, after overtaking the U.S., which had been the largest for the previous hundred years.[300][301] China has also been the second-largest in high-tech manufacturing country since 2012, according to US National Science Foundation.[302] China is the second-largest retail market after the United States.[303] China leads the world in e-commerce, accounting for over 37% of the global market share in 2021.[304] China is the world's leader in electric vehicle consumption and production, manufacturing and buying half of all the plug-in electric cars (BEV and PHEV) in the world as of 2022[update].[305] China is also the leading producer of batteries for electric vehicles as well as several key raw materials for batteries.[306] China received 65.7 million international visitors in 2019,[307] and in 2018 was the fourth-most-visited country in the world.[307] It also experiences an enormous volume of domestic tourism; Chinese tourists made an estimated 6 billion travels within the country in 2019.[308] China hosts the world's second-largest number of World Heritage Sites (56) after Italy, and is one of the most popular tourist destinations (first in the Asia-Pacific). China accounted for 18.6% of the world's total wealth in 2022, second highest in the world after the U.S.[309] China brought more people out of extreme poverty than any other country in history[310][311]—between 1978 and 2018, China reduced extreme poverty by 800 million.[202]: 23 From 1990 to 2018, the proportion of the Chinese population living with an income of less than $1.90 per day (2011 PPP) decreased from 66.3% to 0.3%, the share living with an income of less than $3.20 per day from 90.0% to 2.9%, and the share living with an income of less than $5.50 per day decreased from 98.3% to 17.0%.[312] From 1978 to 2018, the average standard of living multiplied by a factor of twenty-six.[313] Wages in China have grown significantly in the last 40 years—real (inflation-adjusted) wages grew seven-fold from 1978 to 2007.[314] Per capita incomes have also risen significantly – when the PRC was founded in 1949, per capita income in China was one-fifth of the world average; per capita incomes now equal the world average itself.[313] China's development is highly uneven. Its major cities and coastal areas are far more prosperous compared to rural and interior regions.[315] It has a high level of economic inequality,[316] which has increased quickly after the economic reforms,[317] though has decreased significantly in the 2010s.[318] In 2021, China's Gini coefficient was 0.357, according to the World Bank.[12] As of March 2024[update], China was second in the world, after the U.S., in total number of billionaires and total number of millionaires, with 473 Chinese billionaires[319] and 6.2 million millionaires.[309] In 2019, China overtook the U.S. as the home to the highest number of people who have a net personal wealth of at least $110,000, according to the global wealth report by Credit Suisse.[320][321] China had 85 female billionaires as of January 2021[update], two-thirds of the global total.[322] China has had the world's largest middle-class population since 2015;[323] the middle-class grew to 500 million by 2024.[324] China has been a member of the WTO since 2001 and is the world's largest trading power.[325] By 2016, China was the largest trading partner of 124 countries.[326] China became the world's largest trading nation in 2013 by the sum of imports and exports, as well as the world's largest commodity importer, accounting for roughly 45% of maritime's dry-bulk market.[327][328] China's foreign exchange reserves reached US$3.246 trillion as of March 2024[update], making its reserves by far the world's largest.[329] In 2022, China was amongst the world's largest recipient of inward foreign direct investment (FDI), attracting $180 billion, though most of these were speculated to be from Hong Kong.[330] In 2021, China's foreign exchange remittances were $US53 billion making it the second-largest recipient of remittances in the world.[331] China also invests abroad, with a total outward FDI of $147.9 billion in 2023,[332] and a number of major takeovers of foreign firms by Chinese companies.[333] Economists have argued that the renminbi is undervalued, due to currency intervention from the Chinese government, giving China an unfair trade advantage.[334] China has also been widely criticized for manufacturing large quantities of counterfeit goods.[335][336] The U.S. government has also alleged that China does not respect intellectual property (IP) rights and steals IP through espionage operations.[337] In 2020, Harvard University's Economic Complexity Index ranked complexity of China's exports 17th in the world, up from 24th in 2010.[338] The Chinese government has promoted the internationalization of the renminbi in order to wean itself off its dependence on the U.S. dollar as a result of perceived weaknesses of the international monetary system.[339] The renminbi is a component of the IMF's special drawing rights and the world's fourth-most traded currency as of 2023[update].[340] However, partly due to capital controls that make the renminbi fall short of being a fully convertible currency, it remains far behind the Euro, the U.S. Dollar and the Japanese Yen in international trade volumes.[341] China was a world leader in science and technology until the Ming dynasty.[342] Ancient and medieval Chinese discoveries and inventions, such as papermaking, printing, the compass, and gunpowder (the Four Great Inventions), became widespread across East Asia, the Middle East and later Europe. Chinese mathematicians were the first to use negative numbers.[343][344] By the 17th century, the Western World surpassed China in scientific and technological advancement.[345] The causes of this early modern Great Divergence continue to be debated by scholars.[346] After repeated military defeats by the European colonial powers and Imperial Japan in the 19th century, Chinese reformers began promoting modern science and technology as part of the Self-Strengthening Movement. After the Communists came to power in 1949, efforts were made to organize science and technology based on the model of the Soviet Union, in which scientific research was part of central planning.[347] After Mao's death in 1976, science and technology were promoted as one of the Four Modernizations,[348] and the Soviet-inspired academic system was gradually reformed.[349] Since the end of the Cultural Revolution, China has made significant investments in scientific research[350] and is quickly catching up with the U.S. in R&D spending.[351][352] China officially spent around 2.6% of its GDP on R&D in 2023, totaling to around $458.5 billion.[353] According to the World Intellectual Property Indicators, China received more applications than the U.S. did in 2018 and 2019 and ranked first globally in patents, utility models, trademarks, industrial designs, and creative goods exports in 2021.[354][355][356] It was ranked 11th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024, a considerable improvement from its rank of 35th in 2013.[357][358][359] Chinese supercomputers ranked among the fastest in the world.[360][u] Its efforts to develop the most advanced semiconductors and jet engines have seen delays and setbacks.[361][362] China is developing its education system with an emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).[363] Its academic publication apparatus became the world's largest publisher of scientific papers in 2016.[364][365][366] In 2022, China overtook the US in the Nature Index, which measures the share of published articles in leading scientific journals.[367][368] The Chinese space program started in 1958 with some technology transfers from the Soviet Union. However, it did not launch the nation's first satellite until 1970 with the Dong Fang Hong I, which made China the fifth country to do so independently.[369] In 2003, China became the third country in the world to independently send humans into space with Yang Liwei's spaceflight aboard Shenzhou 5. As of 2023, eighteen Chinese nationals have journeyed into space, including two women. In 2011, China launched its first space station testbed, Tiangong-1.[370] In 2013, a Chinese robotic rover Yutu successfully touched down on the lunar surface as part of the Chang'e 3 mission.[371] In 2019, China became the first country to land a probe—Chang'e 4—on the far side of the Moon.[372] In 2020, Chang'e 5 successfully returned Moon samples to the Earth, making China the third country to do so independently.[373] In 2021, China became the third country to land a spacecraft on Mars and the second one to deploy a rover (Zhurong) on Mars.[374] China completed its own modular space station, the Tiangong, in low Earth orbit on 3 November 2022.[375][376][377] On 29 November 2022, China performed its first in-orbit crew handover aboard the Tiangong.[378][379] In May 2023, China announced a plan to land humans on the Moon by 2030.[380] To that end, China has been developing a lunar-capable super-heavy launcher, the Long March 10, a new crewed spacecraft, and a crewed lunar lander.[381][382] China sent Chang'e 6 on 3 May 2024, which conducted the first lunar sample return from Apollo Basin on the far side of the Moon.[383] This is China's second lunar sample return mission, the first was achieved by Chang'e 5 from the lunar near side 4 years ago.[384] It also carried a Chinese rover called Jinchan to conduct infrared spectroscopy of lunar surface and imaged Chang'e 6 lander on lunar surface.[385] The lander-ascender-rover combination was separated with the orbiter and returner before landing on 1 June 2024, at 22:23 UTC. It landed on the Moon's surface on 1 June 2024.[386][387] The ascender was launched back to lunar orbit on 3 June 2024, at 23:38 UTC, carrying samples collected by the lander, which later completed another robotic rendezvous, before docking in lunar orbit. The sample container was then transferred to the returner, which landed on Inner Mongolia in June 2024, completing China's far side extraterrestrial sample return mission. After a decades-long infrastructural boom,[388] China has produced numerous world-leading infrastructural projects: it has the largest high-speed rail network,[389] the most supertall skyscrapers,[390] the largest power plant (the Three Gorges Dam),[391] the most extensive ultra-high-voltage transmission network and innovation infrastructure, [392][393] and a global satellite navigation system with the largest number of satellites.[394] China is the largest telecom market in the world and currently has the largest number of active cellphones of any country, with over 1.7 billion subscribers, as of February 2023[update]. It has the largest number of internet and broadband users, with over 1.09 billion Internet users as of December 2023[update][395]—equivalent to around 77.5% of its population.[396] By 2018, China had more than 1 billion 4G users, accounting for 40% of world's total.[397] China is making rapid advances in 5G—by late 2018, China had started large-scale and commercial 5G trials.[398] As of December 2023[update], China had over 810 million 5G users and 3.38 million base stations installed.[399] China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom, are the three large providers of mobile and internet in China. China Telecom alone served more than 145 million broadband subscribers and 300 million mobile users; China Unicom had about 300 million subscribers; and China Mobile, the largest of them all, had 925 million users, as of 2018[update].[400] Combined, the three operators had over 3.4 million 4G base-stations in China.[401] Several Chinese telecommunications companies, most notably Huawei and ZTE, have been accused of spying for the Chinese military.[402] China has developed its own satellite navigation system, dubbed BeiDou, which began offering commercial navigation services across Asia in 2012[403] as well as global services by the end of 2018.[404] Beidou followed GPS and GLONASS as the third completed global navigation satellite.[405] Since the late 1990s, China's national road network has been significantly expanded through the creation of a network of national highways and expressways. In 2022, China's highways had reached a total length of 177,000 km (110,000 mi), making it the longest highway system in the world.[406] China has the world's largest market for automobiles,[407][408] having surpassed the United States in both auto sales and production. The country is the world's largest exporter of cars by number as of 2023.[409][410] A side-effect of the rapid growth of China's road network has been a significant rise in traffic accidents.[411] In urban areas, bicycles remain a common mode of transport, despite the increasing prevalence of automobiles – as of 2023[update], there are approximately 200 million bicycles in China.[412] China's railways, which are operated by the state-owned China State Railway Group Company, are among the busiest in the world, handling a quarter of the world's rail traffic volume on only 6 percent of the world's tracks in 2006.[413] As of 2023[update], the country had 159,000 km (98,798 mi) of railways, the second-longest network in the world.[414] The railways strain to meet enormous demand particularly during the Chinese New Year holiday, when the world's largest annual human migration takes place.[415] China's high-speed rail (HSR) system started construction in the early 2000s. By the end of 2023, high speed rail in China had reached 45,000 kilometers (27,962 miles) of dedicated lines alone, making it the longest HSR network in the world.[416] Services on the Beijing–Shanghai, Beijing–Tianjin, and Chengdu–Chongqing lines reach up to 350 km/h (217 mph), making them the fastest conventional high speed railway services in the world. With an annual ridership of over 2.3 billion passengers in 2019, it is the world's busiest.[417] The network includes the Beijing–Guangzhou high-speed railway, the single longest HSR line in the world, and the Beijing–Shanghai high-speed railway, which has three of longest railroad bridges in the world.[418] The Shanghai maglev train, which reaches 431 km/h (268 mph), is the fastest commercial train service in the world.[419] Since 2000, the growth of rapid transit systems in Chinese cities has accelerated.[420] As of December 2023[update], 55 Chinese cities have urban mass transit systems in operation.[421] As of 2020[update], China boasts the five longest metro systems in the world with the networks in Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Shenzhen being the largest. The civil aviation industry in China is mostly state-dominated, with the Chinese government retaining a majority stake in the majority of Chinese airlines. The top three airlines in China, which collectively made up 71% of the market in 2018, are all state-owned. Air travel has expanded rapidly in the last decades, with the number of passengers increasing from 16.6 million in 1990 to 551.2 million in 2017.[422] China had approximately 259 airports in 2024.[423] China has over 2,000 river and seaports, about 130 of which are open to foreign shipping.[424] Of the fifty busiest container ports, 15 are located in China, of which the busiest is the Port of Shanghai, also the busiest port in the world.[425] The country's inland waterways are the world's sixth-longest, and total 27,700 km (17,212 mi).[426] Water supply and sanitation infrastructure in China is facing challenges such as rapid urbanization, as well as water scarcity, contamination, and pollution.[427] According to the Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply and Sanitation, about 36% of the rural population in China still did not have access to improved sanitation in 2015.[428][needs update] The ongoing South–North Water Transfer Project intends to abate water shortage in the north.[429] The 2020 Chinese census recorded the population as approximately 1,411,778,724. About 17.95% were 14 years old or younger, 63.35% were between 15 and 59 years old, and 18.7% were over 60 years old.[430] Between 2010 and 2020, the average population growth rate was 0.53%.[430] Given concerns about population growth, China implemented a two-child limit during the 1970s, and, in 1979, began to advocate for an even stricter limit of one child per family. Beginning in the mid-1980s, however, given the unpopularity of the strict limits, China began to allow some major exemptions, particularly in rural areas, resulting in what was actually a \"1.5\"-child policy from the mid-1980s to 2015; ethnic minorities were also exempt from one-child limits.[431] The next major loosening of the policy was enacted in December 2013, allowing families to have two children if one parent is an only child.[432] In 2016, the one-child policy was replaced in favor of a two-child policy.[433] A three-child policy was announced on 31 May 2021, due to population aging,[433] and in July 2021, all family size limits as well as penalties for exceeding them were removed.[434] In 2023, the total fertility rate was reported to be 1.09, ranking among the lowest in the world.[435] In 2023, National Bureau of Statistics estimated that the population fell 850,000 from 2021 to 2022, the first decline since 1961.[436] According to one group of scholars, one-child limits had little effect on population growth[437] or total population size.[438] However, these scholars have been challenged.[439] The policy, along with traditional preference for boys, may have contributed to an imbalance in the sex ratio at birth.[440][441] The 2020 census found that males accounted for 51.2% of the total population.[442] However, China's sex ratio is more balanced than it was in 1953, when males accounted for 51.8% of the population.[443] The cultural preference for male children, combined with the one-child policy, led to an excess of female child orphans in China, and in the 1990s through around 2007, there was an active stream of adoptions of (mainly female) babies by American and other foreign parents.[444] However, increased restrictions by the Chinese Government slowed foreign adoptions significantly in 2007 and again in 2015.[445] China has urbanized significantly in recent decades. The percent of the country's population living in urban areas increased from 20% in 1980 to over 66% in 2023.[446][447][448] China has over 160 cities with a population of over one million,[449] including the 17 megacities as of 2021[update][450][451] (cities with a population of over 10 million) of Chongqing, Shanghai, Beijing, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Xi'an, Suzhou, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Linyi, Shijiazhuang, Dongguan, Qingdao and Changsha.[452] The total permanent population of Chongqing, Shanghai, Beijing and Chengdu is above 20 million.[453] Shanghai is China's most populous urban area[454][455] while Chongqing is its largest city proper, the only city in China with a permanent population of over 30 million.[456] The figures in the table below are from the 2020 census, and are only estimates of the urban populations within administrative city limits; a different ranking exists for total municipal populations. The large \"floating populations\" of migrant workers make conducting censuses in urban areas difficult;[457] the figures below include only long-term residents. China legally recognizes 56 distinct ethnic groups, who comprise the Zhonghua minzu. The largest of these nationalities are the Han Chinese, who constitute more than 91% of the total population.[430] The Han Chinese – the world's largest single ethnic group[461] – outnumber other ethnic groups in every place excluding Tibet, Xinjiang,[462] Linxia,[463] and autonomous prefectures like Xishuangbanna.[464] Ethnic minorities account for less than 10% of the population of China, according to the 2020 census.[430] Compared with the 2010 population census, the Han population increased by 60,378,693 persons, or 4.93%, while the population of the 55 national minorities combined increased by 11,675,179 persons, or 10.26%.[430] The 2020 census recorded a total of 845,697 foreign nationals living in mainland China.[465] There are as many as 292 living languages in China.[466] The languages most commonly spoken belong to the Sinitic branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family, which contains Mandarin (spoken by 80% of the population),[467][468] and other varieties of Chinese language: Jin, Wu, Min, Hakka, Yue, Xiang, Gan, Hui, Ping and unclassified Tuhua (Shaozhou Tuhua and Xiangnan Tuhua).[469] Languages of the Tibeto-Burman branch, including Tibetan, Qiang, Naxi and Yi, are spoken across the Tibetan and Yunnan–Guizhou Plateau. Other ethnic minority languages in southwestern China include Zhuang, Thai, Dong and Sui of the Tai-Kadai family, Miao and Yao of the Hmong–Mien family, and Wa of the Austroasiatic family. Across northeastern and northwestern China, local ethnic groups speak Altaic languages including Manchu, Mongolian and several Turkic languages: Uyghur, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Salar and Western Yugur.[470] Korean is spoken natively along the border with North Korea. Sarikoli, the language of Tajiks in western Xinjiang, is an Indo-European language.[471] Taiwanese indigenous peoples, including a small population on the mainland, speak Austronesian languages.[472] Standard Chinese, a variety based on the Beijing dialect of Mandarin, is the national language of China, having de facto official status.[2] It is used as a lingua franca between people of different linguistic backgrounds.[473] In the autonomous regions of China, other languages may also serve as a lingua franca, such as Uyghur in Xinjiang, where governmental services in Uyghur are constitutionally guaranteed.[474] Freedom of religion is guaranteed by China's constitution, although religious organizations that lack official approval can be subject to state persecution.[185] The government of the country is officially atheist. Religious affairs and issues in the country are overseen by the National Religious Affairs Administration, under the United Front Work Department.[479] Over the millennia, the Chinese civilization has been influenced by various religious movements. The \"three doctrines\" of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism have historically shaped Chinese culture,[480][481] enriching a theological and spiritual framework of traditional religion which harks back to the early Shang and Zhou dynasty. Chinese folk religion, which is framed by the three doctrines and by other traditions,[482] consists in allegiance to the shen, who can be deities of the surrounding nature or ancestral principles of human groups, concepts of civility, culture heroes, many of whom feature in Chinese mythology and history.[483] Amongst the most popular cults of folk religion are those of the Yellow Emperor, embodiment of the God of Heaven and one of the two divine patriarchs of the Chinese people,[484][485] of Mazu (goddess of the seas),[484] Guandi (god of war and business), Caishen (god of prosperity and richness), Pangu and many others. In the early decades of the 21st century, the Chinese government has been engaged in a rehabilitation of folk cults—formally recognizing them as \"folk beliefs\" as distinguished from doctrinal religions,[486] and often reconstructing them into forms of \"highly curated\" civil religion[487]—as well as in a national and international promotion of Buddhism.[488] China is home to many of the world's tallest religious statues, representing either deities of Chinese folk religion or enlightened beings of Buddhism; the tallest of all is the Spring Temple Buddha in Henan. Statistics on religious affiliation in China are difficult to gather due to complex and varying definitions of religion and the diffusive nature of Chinese religious traditions. Scholars note that in China there is no clear boundary between the three doctrines and local folk religious practices.[480] Chinese religions or some of their currents are also definable as non-theistic and humanistic, since they do not hold that divine creativity is completely transcendent, but that it is inherent in the world and in particular in the human being.[489] According to studies published in 2023, compiling demographic analyses conducted throughout the 2010s and the early 2020s, 70% of the Chinese population believed in or practiced Chinese folk religion—among them, with an approach of non-exclusivity, 33.4% may be identified as Buddhists, 19.6% as Taoists, and 17.7% as adherents of other types of folk religion.[4] Of the remaining population, 25.2% are fully non-believers or atheists, 2.5% are adherents of Christianity, and 1.6% are adherents of Islam.[4] Chinese folk religion also comprises a variety of salvationist doctrinal organized movements which emerged since the Song dynasty.[490] There are also ethnic minorities in China who maintain their own indigenous religions, while major religions characteristic of specific ethnic groups include Tibetan Buddhism among Tibetans, Mongols and Yugurs,[491] and Islam among the Hui, Uyghur, Kazakh,[492] and Kyrgyz peoples, and other ethnicities in the northern and northwestern regions of the country. Compulsory education in China comprises primary and junior secondary school, which together last for nine years from the age of 6 and 15.[495] The Gaokao, China's national university entrance exam, is a prerequisite for entrance into most higher education institutions. Vocational education is available to students at the secondary and tertiary level.[496] More than 10 million Chinese students graduated from vocational colleges every year.[497] In 2023, about 91.8 percent of students continued their education at a three-year senior secondary school, while 60.2 percent of secondary school graduates were enrolled in higher education.[498] China has the largest education system in the world,[499] with about 291 million students and 18.92 million full-time teachers in over 498,300 schools in 2023.[500] Annual education investment went from less than US$50 billion in 2003 to more than US$817 billion in 2020.[501][502] However, there remains an inequality in education spending. In 2010, the annual education expenditure per secondary school student in Beijing totalled ¥20,023, while in Guizhou, one of the poorest provinces, it only totalled ¥3,204.[503] China's literacy rate has grown dramatically, from only 20% in 1949 and 65.5% in 1979,[504] to 97% of the population over age 15 in 2020.[505] As of 2023[update], China has over 3,074 universities, with over 47.6 million students enrolled in mainland China, giving China the largest higher education system in the world.[506][507] As of 2023[update], China had the world's highest number of top universities.[508][509] Currently, China trails only the United States and the United Kingdom in terms of representation on lists of the top 200 universities according to the 2023 Aggregate Ranking of Top Universities, a composite ranking system of three world-most followed university rankings (ARWU+QS+THE).[510] China is home to two of the highest-ranking universities (Tsinghua University and Peking University) in Asia and emerging economies, according to the Times Higher Education World University Rankings[511] and the Academic Ranking of World Universities.[512] These universities are members of the C9 League, an alliance of elite Chinese universities offering comprehensive and leading education.[513] The National Health Commission, together with its counterparts in the local commissions, oversees the health needs of the population.[514] An emphasis on public health and preventive medicine has characterized Chinese health policy since the early 1950s. The Communist Party started the Patriotic Health Campaign, which was aimed at improving sanitation and hygiene, as well as treating and preventing several diseases. Diseases such as cholera, typhoid and scarlet fever, which were previously rife in China, were nearly eradicated by the campaign.[515] After Deng Xiaoping began instituting economic reforms in 1978, the health of the Chinese public improved rapidly because of better nutrition, although many of the free public health services provided in the countryside disappeared. Healthcare in China became mostly privatized, and experienced a significant rise in quality. In 2009, the government began a three-year large-scale healthcare provision initiative worth US$124 billion.[516] By 2011, the campaign resulted in 95% of China's population having basic health insurance coverage.[517] By 2022, China had established itself as a key producer and exporter of pharmaceuticals, producing around 40 percent of active pharmaceutical ingredients in 2017.[518] As of 2023[update], the life expectancy at birth exceeds 78 years.[519]: 163 As of 2021[update], the infant mortality rate is 5 per thousand.[520] Both have improved significantly since the 1950s.[v] Rates of stunting, a condition caused by malnutrition, have declined from 33.1% in 1990 to 9.9% in 2010.[523] Despite significant improvements in health and the construction of advanced medical facilities, China has several emerging public health problems, such as respiratory illnesses caused by widespread air pollution,[524] hundreds of millions of cigarette smokers,[525] and an increase in obesity among urban youths.[526][527] In 2010, air pollution caused 1.2 million premature deaths in China.[528] Chinese mental health services are inadequate.[529] China's large population and densely populated cities have led to serious disease outbreaks, such as SARS in 2003, although this has since been largely contained.[530] The COVID-19 pandemic was first identified in Wuhan in December 2019;[531][532] pandemic led the government to enforce strict public health measures intended to completely eradicate the virus, a goal that was eventually abandoned in December 2022 after protests against the policy.[533][534] Since ancient times, Chinese culture has been heavily influenced by Confucianism. Chinese culture, in turn, has heavily influenced East Asia and Southeast Asia.[536] For much of the country's dynastic era, opportunities for social advancement could be provided by high performance in the prestigious imperial examinations, which have their origins in the Han dynasty.[537] The literary emphasis of the exams affected the general perception of cultural refinement in China, such as the belief that calligraphy, poetry and painting were higher forms of art than dancing or drama. Chinese culture has long emphasized a sense of deep history and a largely inward-looking national perspective.[538] Examinations and a culture of merit remain greatly valued in China today.[539] Today, the Chinese government has accepted numerous elements of traditional Chinese culture as being integral to Chinese society. With the rise of Chinese nationalism and the end of the Cultural Revolution, various forms of traditional Chinese art, literature, music, film, fashion and architecture have seen a vigorous revival,[541][542] and folk and variety art in particular have sparked interest nationally and even worldwide.[543] Access to foreign media remains heavily restricted.[544] Chinese architecture has developed over millennia in China and has remained a vestigial source of perennial influence on the development of East Asian architecture,[545][546][547] including in Japan, Korea, and Mongolia.[548] and minor influences on the architecture of Southeast and South Asia including the countries of Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and the Philippines.[549][550] Chinese architecture is characterized by bilateral symmetry, use of enclosed open spaces, feng shui (e.g. directional hierarchies),[551] a horizontal emphasis, and an allusion to various cosmological, mythological or in general symbolic elements. Chinese architecture traditionally classifies structures according to type, ranging from pagodas to palaces.[552][548] Chinese architecture varies widely based on status or affiliation, such as whether the structures were constructed for emperors, commoners, or for religious purposes. Other variations in Chinese architecture are shown in vernacular styles associated with different geographic regions and different ethnic heritages, such as the stilt houses in the south, the Yaodong buildings in the northwest, the yurt buildings of nomadic people, and the Siheyuan buildings in the north.[553] Chinese literature has its roots in the Zhou dynasty's literary tradition.[554] The classical texts of China encompass a wide range of thoughts and subjects, such as the calendar, military, astrology, herbology, and geography, as well as many others.[555] Among the most significant early works are the I Ching and the Shujing, which are part of the Four Books and Five Classics. These texts were the cornerstone of the Confucian curriculum sponsored by the state throughout the dynastic periods. Inherited from the Classic of Poetry, classical Chinese poetry developed to its floruit during the Tang dynasty. Li Bai and Du Fu opened the forking ways for the poetic circles through romanticism and realism respectively. Chinese historiography began with the Shiji, the overall scope of the historiographical tradition in China is termed the Twenty-Four Histories, which set a vast stage for Chinese fictions along with Chinese mythology and folklore.[556] Pushed by a burgeoning citizen class in the Ming dynasty, Chinese classical fiction rose to a boom of the historical, town and gods and demons fictions as represented by the Four Great Classical Novels which include Water Margin, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Journey to the West and Dream of the Red Chamber.[557] Along with the wuxia fictions of Jin Yong and Liang Yusheng,[558] it remains an enduring source of popular culture in the Chinese sphere of influence.[559] In the wake of the New Culture Movement after the end of the Qing dynasty, Chinese literature embarked on a new era with written vernacular Chinese for ordinary citizens. Hu Shih and Lu Xun were pioneers in modern literature.[560] Various literary genres, such as misty poetry, scar literature, young adult fiction and the xungen literature, which is influenced by magic realism,[561] emerged following the Cultural Revolution. Mo Yan, a xungen literature author, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2012.[562] Chinese music covers a highly diverse range of music from traditional music to modern music. Chinese music dates back before the pre-imperial times. Traditional Chinese musical instruments were traditionally grouped into eight categories known as bayin (八音). Traditional Chinese opera is a form of musical theatre in China originating thousands of years and has regional style forms such as Beijing and Cantonese opera.[563] Chinese pop (C-Pop) includes mandopop and cantopop. Chinese hip hop and Hong Kong hip hop have become popular.[564] Hanfu is the historical clothing of the Han people in China. The qipao or cheongsam is a popular Chinese female dress.[565] The hanfu movement has been popular in contemporary times and seeks to revitalize Hanfu clothing.[566] China Fashion Week is the country's only national-level fashion festival.[567] Cinema was first introduced to China in 1896 and the first Chinese film, Dingjun Mountain, was released in 1905.[568] China has the largest number of movie screens in the world since 2016;[569] China became the largest cinema market in 2020.[570][571] The top three highest-grossing films in China as of 2023[update] were The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021), Wolf Warrior 2 (2017), and Hi, Mom (2021).[572] Chinese cuisine is highly diverse, drawing on several millennia of culinary history and geographical variety, in which the most influential are known as the \"Eight Major Cuisines\", including Sichuan, Cantonese, Jiangsu, Shandong, Fujian, Hunan, Anhui, and Zhejiang cuisines.[573] Chinese cuisine is known for its breadth of cooking methods and ingredients.[574] China's staple food is rice in the northeast and south, and wheat-based breads and noodles in the north. Bean products such as tofu and soy milk remain a popular source of protein. Pork is now the most popular meat in China, accounting for about three-fourths of the country's total meat consumption.[575] There is also the vegetarian Buddhist cuisine and the pork-free Chinese Islamic cuisine. Chinese cuisine, due to the area's proximity to the ocean and milder climate, has a wide variety of seafood and vegetables. Offshoots of Chinese food, such as Hong Kong cuisine and American Chinese cuisine, have emerged in the Chinese diaspora. China has one of the oldest sporting cultures. There is evidence that archery (shèjiàn) was practiced during the Western Zhou dynasty. Swordplay (jiànshù) and cuju, a sport loosely related to association football[576] date back to China's early dynasties as well.[577] Physical fitness is widely emphasized in Chinese culture, with morning exercises such as qigong and tai chi widely practiced,[578] and commercial gyms and private fitness clubs are gaining popularity.[579] Basketball is the most popular spectator sport in China.[580] The Chinese Basketball Association and the American National Basketball Association also have a huge national following amongst the Chinese populace, with native-born and NBA-bound Chinese players and well-known national household names such as Yao Ming and Yi Jianlian being held in high esteem.[581] China's professional football league, known as Chinese Super League, is the largest football market in East Asia.[582] Other popular sports include martial arts, table tennis, badminton, swimming and snooker. China is home to a huge number of cyclists, with an estimated 470 million bicycles as of 2012[update].[583] China has the world's largest esports market.[584] Many more traditional sports, such as dragon boat racing, Mongolian-style wrestling and horse racing are also popular.[585] China has participated in the Olympic Games since 1932, although it has only participated as the PRC since 1952. China hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, where its athletes received 48 gold medals – the highest number of any participating nation that year.[586] China also won the most medals at the 2012 Summer Paralympics, with 231 overall, including 95 gold.[587][588] In 2011, Shenzhen hosted the 2011 Summer Universiade. China hosted the 2013 East Asian Games in Tianjin and the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics in Nanjing, the first country to host both regular and Youth Olympics. Beijing and its nearby city Zhangjiakou collaboratively hosted the 2022 Winter Olympics, making Beijing the first dual Olympic city by holding both the Summer Olympics and the Winter Olympics.[589][590] China hosted the Asian Games in 1990 (Beijing), 2010 (Guangzhou), and 2023 (Hangzhou).[591] This article incorporates text from a free content work.

                "content": "Britt Allcroft (born Hilary Mary Allcroft, 14 December 1943 – 25 December 2024) was an English writer, producer, director, and voice actress. She was best known for adapting the Reverend Wilbert Awdry's The Railway Series and turning it into children's television series Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends (later re-titled Thomas & Friends). She was also known for creating Shining Time Station (with Rick Siggelkow), Mr. Conductor's Thomas Tales, and Magic Adventures of Mumfie. She also wrote, co-produced, and directed the film Thomas and the Magic Railroad (2000). Hilary Mary Allcroft was born on 14 December 1943 in Worthing, West Sussex, England. At the age of 16, she changed her first name to Britt as her career in British radio and television gained momentum. She went on to create a succession of programmes for the BBC and ITV during the 1970s and 1980s, including Moon Clue Game, Dance Crazy and Keepsakes. Mothers By Daughters, produced for Channel 4, was broadcast by PBS in the United States. She also worked in theatre, staging shows at the London Palladium and Drury Lane Theatres.[1] While making a documentary about British steam trains in August 1979, Allcroft met the Reverend Wilbert Awdry, author of the children's book series The Railway Series. She said, \"It really didn't take me long to become intrigued by the characters, the relationships between them and the nostalgia they invoked.\" She told him that she wanted to bring these stories to life and made an arrangement to secure certain rights through his then-publishers Kaye & Ward.[2] In 1980, she co-founded Britt Allcroft Railway Productions (later known as The Britt Allcroft Company) with her husband, television producer Angus Wright. It took Allcroft four years to raise the funding for, and create, a first series of 26 episodes in collaboration with director David Mitton. The first two episodes of Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends were aired together for the first time on British television on 9 October 1984, with narration by Ringo Starr and music by Mike O'Donnell and Junior Campbell. The success of the series in the UK, and the merchandising campaign that Allcroft had been organising since 1983, soon led to further success in other parts of the world. In 1989, she and American producer Rick Siggelkow created Shining Time Station, a live-action children's sitcom fronted by the magical character of the miniature Mr. Conductor, who introduced two Thomas stories in each half-hour programme. Shining Time Station won a number of awards and significantly increased the popularity of the Thomas media franchise in the US. Shining Time Station lasted until 1995 and, in 1996, she created the short spin-off series Mr. Conductor's Thomas Tales. In 1994, Allcroft followed Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends and Shining Time Station with the cartoon-animated Magic Adventures of Mumfie, in collaboration with director John Collins. Inspired by the books by Katharine Tozer, that production received critical acclaim and was seen worldwide.[3] In 2008, several years after she left her original company, Allcroft revived the Mumfie library, and a reboot series eventually aired in 2021. Allcroft wrote and directed Thomas and the Magic Railroad, a film based on the Thomas franchise, that was released in 2000. She also provided the voice of the character Lady.[4] The film was a critical and commercial failure. The poor box-office performance of the film caused Allcroft to resign as deputy chairwoman of her company in September 2000.[5] In 2023, a documentary titled An Unlikely Fandom was released by filmmaker Brannon Carty, which centres around the Thomas the Tank Engine internet fandom. Allcroft makes occasional appearances throughout the documentary via older interview clips of her as well as appearing at a screening for the film with Carty.[6] Allcroft was previously married to television producer Angus Wright in 1973, but later divorced in 1997. They had two children, one being Holly Wright.[7][8][9] Allcroft died in Los Angeles, California on 25 December 2024, at the age of 81. Her death was announced by filmmaker Brannon Carty on Twitter on 3 January 2025.[9][10]",

                "content": "Britt Allcroft, the creative force behind the beloved “Thomas & Friends” franchise, passed away on December 25, 2024, at the age of 81. Her passing marks the end of an era for millions who grew up watching the adventures of Thomas the Tank Engine and his friends. Allcroft’s influence extended far beyond television screens, shaping the imaginations of children across the world. Born as Hilary Mary Allcroft in Worthing, England, in 1943, Britt was destined for a career in storytelling. At the age of 16, she made the bold decision to change her name to Britt, a move that reflected her independent spirit as she ventured into the world of British television. This new identity marked the beginning of a journey that would eventually lead her to global recognition. Throughout the 1970s, Allcroft honed her skills as a producer, working on various British television shows. One of her earliest projects, “Get It-Got-It-Good,” gave her valuable experience in children’s programming, laying the foundation for her future endeavors. However, it was a fateful encounter with “The Railway Series” books that truly set her career on an extraordinary path. In 1979, while producing a documentary about a railway in Sussex, Allcroft discovered the enchanting world of “The Railway Series” by Rev. W. Awdry. The books, rich with tales of anthropomorphic trains and heartfelt lessons, captured her imagination. As she later recalled, “It really didn’t take me long to become intrigued by the characters, the relationships between them, and the nostalgia they invoked.” Determined to bring these characters to the screen, Allcroft secured the rights to adapt the books. With her husband, fellow producer Angus Wright, she founded the Britt Allcroft Company and embarked on a challenging journey to finance the first 26 episodes of what would become “Thomas & Friends.” The series premiered in 1984 and became an instant hit. Narrated initially by Ringo Starr, the show captured the hearts of children in the UK and beyond. The U.S. audience was introduced to the series through “Shining Time Station,” further solidifying its place as a cultural phenomenon. Allcroft’s dedication to “Thomas & Friends” was matched by her commitment to her family. She and Wright, who divorced in 1997, raised two children together. Their daughter, Holly Wright, has since followed in her mother’s footsteps, becoming involved in television and film production. Despite the demands of her career, Allcroft maintained a balance between work and family. Her passion for storytelling never waned, and she continued to contribute to the “Thomas” franchise for decades. In 2000, she wrote and directed “Thomas and the Magic Railroad,” lending her voice to the character of Lady. Although the film faced mixed reviews, it remains a cherished memory for many fans. Even as the series concluded its 27-year run, the legacy of “Thomas & Friends” endured. In 2023, Allcroft appeared in “An Unlikely Fandom,” a documentary directed by Brannon Carty. The film explored the vast and unexpected internet community surrounding the “Thomas” franchise, showcasing how Allcroft’s creation had transcended generations. Carty, who announced Allcroft’s passing on X (formerly Twitter), paid tribute to her impact: “Britt was an adoring mother and wife. A visionary producer. She brought so much joy and happiness to people everywhere during her time on Earth.” Allcroft’s contributions to children’s entertainment extended beyond Thomas. Her vision led to various spin-offs, films, and merchandise, including titles like “Diesel: Impossible,” “The Looney Diesels,” and “Thomas & Friends ERTL Adventures: The Biggest Christmas Adventure.” Her influence wasn’t limited to television. The “Thomas & Friends” brand became a cornerstone of children’s toys, books, and live events. Generations of fans continue to share the stories of Thomas with their own children, a testament to Allcroft’s enduring legacy. At the time of her passing, Britt Allcroft was estimated to have a net worth of around $10 million. Her success reflected not only her business acumen but also the universal appeal of her creations. She is survived by her daughter, son, and grandchildren, who continue to honor her memory and celebrate her achievements. Britt Allcroft’s passing leaves behind a legacy of joy, creativity, and timeless storytelling. Her work brought happiness to millions, teaching valuable lessons about friendship, perseverance, and kindness. As Thomas the Tank Engine continues to chug along in the hearts of fans worldwide, Allcroft’s spirit lives on. To many, she wasn’t just a producer or writer; she was a guiding force behind some of the most cherished memories of childhood. Rest in peace, Britt Allcroft.

                "content": "Britt Allcroft, creator of the beloved Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends children's TV series, has died. The British-born producer died last week in Santa Monica, Calif., at 81. The death was confirmed by Brannon Carty, the creator of a documentary about Thomas fandom and a friend of the TV producer's. No cause of death was given. Thomas started out as a character in a series of books dating back to the 1940s by Rev. Wilbert Awdry, an English Anglican minister and train enthusiast. Awdry's The Railway Series revolved around a cast of anthropomorphic trains, including Thomas and his friends Gordon, James and Percy, all chuffing along on the imaginary island of Sodor. But Allcroft made Thomas an international sensation, starting in the mid-1980s with her TV adaptation narrated by Ringo Starr. The series, which was later renamed Thomas & Friends, ran for more than three decades and featured other famous narrators such as George Carlin and Alec Baldwin. It has spawned TV spin-offs, movies, stage productions and a ton of merch. And the appeal goes beyond kids. The 2023 documentary An Unlikely Fandom is about grownups' passion for the little blue locomotive. Filmmaker Brannon Carty — a lifelong Thomas fan — said he got to know Allcroft in her final years. \"She was just an incredible woman who was still a child at heart,\" Carty said in an interview with NPR. \"But she was a businesswoman at the same time. So, she understood what children wanted, and also knew how to sell it.\" Allcroft was born in 1943 in Worthing, a town on England's south coast. Beyond Thomas, her 1990s animated series Magic Adventures of Mumfie, about a sweet little gray elephant and his friends, was a particular hit. \"I wanted to do something very different from Thomas that would be very magical and epic and hopefully have lots of music in it, and would, in the same way as Thomas, help give children love, and security, and inspiration, and comfort, and fun,\" Allcroft told NPR in a 2013 interview. Allcroft also said she aimed to create shows that gave children an antidote to hectic modern life. \"Children, they're multidimensional,\" she said. \"And they still like that time where they can be with their stories, be with their characters, and feel that they're not being pushed.\" Copyright 2025 NPR",

By Mike Barnes Senior Editor Britt Allcroft, the British writer, director and producer who steered the animated locomotive Thomas the Tank Engine to television 40 years ago en route to launching a beloved, lucrative franchise, has died. She was 81. Allcroft died on Christmas Day in Los Angeles, her daughter, Holly Wright, told The New York Times. Thomas the Tank Engine was created by the Rev. Wilbert Awdry in a series of 1940s children’s books (he based the train on a wooden toy made for his son). Allcroft’s first adaptation, which she financed by mortgaging her house, was a 26-episode series that bowed in 1984 on ITV in the U.K. as Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends.

She went on to work for Southern Television and form her own production company to launch TV and stage shows. She discovered Thomas in 1979 while she was making a documentary on British steam trains, and it would take her five years to get her show with the character up and running. British company Hit Entertainment bought her company in 2002, and Mattel in turn acquired Hit in 2012 as part of a $680 million deal.

                "content": "Defunct Newspapers Journals TV channels Websites Other Economics Gun rights Identity politics Nativist Religion Watchdog groups Youth/student groups Miscellaneous Other Clarence Thomas (born June 23, 1948) is an American lawyer and jurist who has served since 1991 as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. President George H. W. Bush nominated him to succeed Thurgood Marshall. After Marshall, Thomas is the second African American to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court and has been its longest-serving member since Anthony Kennedy's retirement in 2018. He has also been the Court's oldest member since Stephen Breyer retired in 2022. Thomas was born in Pin Point, Georgia. After his father abandoned the family, he was raised by his grandfather in a poor Gullah community near Savannah, Georgia. Growing up as a devout Catholic, Thomas originally intended to be a priest in the Catholic Church, but he was frustrated by what he saw as the church's insufficient attempts to combat racism. He abandoned his aspiration of becoming a clergyman and graduated from the College of the Holy Cross and Yale Law School, where he was influenced by a number of conservative authors, especially Thomas Sowell. Upon graduating, he was appointed as an assistant attorney general in Missouri and later entered private practice there. He became a legislative assistant to U.S. Senator John Danforth in 1979, and was made Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Education in 1981. President Ronald Reagan appointed Thomas as Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) the next year. President George H. W. Bush nominated Thomas to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1990. He served in that role for 19 months before filling Marshall's seat on the Supreme Court. Thomas's confirmation hearings were bitter and intensely fought, centering on an accusation that he had sexually harassed Anita Hill, a subordinate at the Department of Education and the EEOC.[5] The Senate confirmed Thomas by a vote of 52–48, the narrowest margin in a century.[6] Since the death of Antonin Scalia, Thomas has been the Court's foremost originalist, stressing the original meaning in interpreting the U.S. Constitution.[7] In contrast to Scalia—who had been the only other consistent originalist—he pursues a more classically liberal variety of originalism.[8] Until 2020, Thomas was known for his silence during most oral arguments,[9] though has since begun asking more questions to counsel.[10] He is notable for his majority opinions in Good News Club v. Milford Central School (determining the freedom of religious speech in relation to the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution) and New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen (affirming the individual right to bear arms outside the home), as well as his dissent in Gonzales v. Raich (arguing that the U.S. Congress may not criminalize the private cultivation of medical cannabis). He is widely considered to be the Court's most conservative member. Thomas was born on June 23, 1948, in his parents' wooden shack in Pin Point, Georgia.[11][12] Pin Point was a small community near Savannah founded by freedmen in the 1880s.[13] He was the second of three children of M.C. Thomas, a farm worker, and Leola Williams.[11] Williams had been born out of wedlock; after her mother's death, she was sent from Liberty County, Georgia, to live with an aunt in Pin Point.[14][15][16] The family were descendants of enslaved people and spoke Gullah as a first language.[17] Thomas's earliest known ancestors were slaves named Sandy and Peggy, who were born in the late 18th century and owned by wealthy planter Josiah Wilson of Liberty County.[18] Thomas's older sister, Emma, was born in 1946, and his younger brother, Myers, in 1949.[19] Upon becoming pregnant with Thomas's older sister, Leola was expelled from her Baptist church and dropped out of high school after the 10th grade; her father ordered her to marry M.C. in January 1947. After three years of marriage, M.C. sued for divorce, claiming that Leola neglected the children, and a judge granted the request in March 1951.[19] After the divorce, M.C. moved to Savannah and later Pennsylvania, visiting his children only once. Leola went to work as a maid in Savannah during the week and returned to Pin Point on the weekends. Custody of the children was awarded to Leola's aunt.[20][21] When her aunt's house burned down in 1955, Leola took her children to live with her in the room she rented in a tenement with an outdoor toilet in Savannah, leaving her daughter with the aunt in Pin Point. She asked her father, Myers Anderson, for help. He initially refused but agreed after his wife threatened to throw him out.[22][23] Thomas and his brother went to live with Anderson, his maternal grandfather, in 1955 and experienced amenities such as indoor plumbing and regular meals for the first time.[24] Despite having little formal education, Anderson had built a successful business delivering coal, oil, and ice.[22] When racial unrest led to widespread protest and marches in Savannah from 1960 to 1963, Anderson used his wealth to bail out demonstrators and took his grandchildren to meetings promoted by the NAACP.[25] Thomas has described his grandfather as the person who has influenced his life the most.[26] Anderson converted to Catholicism and sent Thomas to be educated at a series of Catholic schools. Thomas attended the predominantly black St. Pius X High School in Chatham County[27] for two years before transferring to St. John Vianney's Minor Seminary on the Isle of Hope, where he was the segregated boarding school's first black student.[28][29] Though he experienced hazing, he performed well academically.[15] He spent many hours at the Carnegie Library, the only library for Blacks in Savannah before libraries were desegregated in 1961.[30][31][a] When Thomas was ten years old, Anderson began putting his grandsons to work during the summers, helping him build a house on a plot of farmland he owned, building fences, and doing farm work.[33] He believed in hard work and self-reliance,[34] never showed his grandsons affection,[33] beat them frequently according to Leola, and impressed the importance of a good education on them.[35] Anderson taught Thomas that \"all of our rights as human beings came from God, not man\", and that racial segregation was a violation of divine law.[36] During his freshman year from 1967 to 1968, Thomas attended Conception Seminary College, a Benedictine seminary in Missouri, with the intent to become a priest; no one in Thomas's family had attended college before.[37][28] After Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, he overheard a fellow student say, \"Good. I hope the son of a bitch dies\" and \"[t]hat's what they should do to all the niggers\".[38][39][40] The display of racism moved Thomas to leave the seminary.[41] He thought the church did not do enough to combat racism and resolved to abandon the priesthood.[42][38] He left at the end of the semester.[38] At a nun's suggestion, Thomas enrolled at the College of the Holy Cross, an elite Catholic college in Massachusetts, as a sophomore transfer student on a full academic scholarship.[43][44] He was one of the college's first black students, being one of twenty recruited by President John E. Brooks in 1968 in a group that also included the future attorney Ted Wells, the running back Eddie Jenkins Jr., and the novelist Edward P. Jones.[45] In the fall of that year, Thomas and other black students founded the college's Black Student Union (BSU), which became an important part of their campus identity.[46] Without financial support from his grandfather, he defrayed his expenses by working as a waiter and dishwasher in the college's dining hall.[47] Thomas later recalled, \"I was 19. My only hope was Holy Cross College\".[48] Professors at Holy Cross remembered Thomas as a determined, diligent student.[49] He kept to a strict routine of studying alone and stayed back during holidays to continue working.[50] Thomas C. Lawler, an English professor at Holy Cross,[51] recalled him as having \"never talked very much in class. He was the kind of person you really might not notice\".[49] By contrast, he was outspoken at BSU meetings, distinguishing himself as a contrarian who often feuded with Ted Wells. The future running back Ed Jenkins, a BSU member, said Thomas \"could turn on a dime and reduce you to intellectual rubble\".[52][53] Edward P. Jones, who lived across from Thomas as a sophomore, reflected that \"there was a fierce determination I sensed from him [Thomas], that he was going to get as much as he could and get as far, ultimately, as he could\".[54] Thomas became a vocal student activist as an undergraduate. He became acquainted with black separatism, the black Muslim Movement, the black power movement, and displayed a poster of Malcolm X in his dormitory room.[56] When some black students were disproportionately punished in comparison with white students for the same violation, he suggested a walkout in protest. The BSU adopted his idea, and Thomas, along with sixty other black students, departed campus.[57][58] Some of the priests negotiated with the protesting black students to reenter the school.[28] When administrators granted amnesty to all protesters, Thomas returned to the college, later also to attend anti-war marches. In April 1970, he participated in the violent 1970 Harvard Square riots.[59] He has credited his protests for his turn toward conservatism and subsequent disillusionment with leftist movements.[60][61][54] Having struggled with English as a native speaker of Gullah, Thomas chose to major in English literature.[62][63] He became a member of Alpha Sigma Nu, the Jesuit honor society, and the Purple Key Society, of which he was the only black member.[64] The college's focus on a liberal arts education introduced him to the writings of black intellectuals such as Richard Wright, whose literary works Thomas sympathized with.[56] His admiration of Malcolm X led him to read The Autobiography of Malcolm X to the point of wearing down the pages of his copy.[65] Thomas graduated from Holy Cross on June 4, 1971, with a Bachelor of Arts, cum laude, ranked ninth in his class.[66] He applied to and was accepted by Yale Law School, Harvard Law School, and the University of Pennsylvania Law School.[67][68] That same year, Thomas matriculated at Yale Law School as one of twelve black students.[69] Yale offered him the best financial aid package, and he was attracted to the civil rights activism of some of its faculty members.[70][71] Finding it difficult to keep up with the school's expectations, he struggled to connect with other students who came from upper-class backgrounds. He enrolled in Yale's most difficult courses and became a student of the property law scholar Quintin Johnstone, who became his favorite professor.[72][73] Johnstone remembered Thomas as having \"performed very well\".[74] Guido Calabresi, the dean of Yale Law School, described Thomas and fellow student Hillary Clinton as \"both excellent students [who] had the same kind of reputation\".[74] Thomas obtained his Juris Doctor on May 20, 1974.[75] After graduation, he sought to enter private practice as a corporate lawyer in Atlanta, Georgia.[76] He saw his experience in law school as disappointing, as law firms assumed he was accepted because of affirmative action.[77] According to Thomas, the law firms also \"asked pointed questions, unsubtly suggesting that they doubted I was as smart as my grades indicated\".[78] In his 2007 memoir, he wrote: \"I peeled a fifteen-cent sticker off a package of cigars and stuck it on the frame of my law degree to remind myself of the mistake I'd made by going to Yale. I never did change my mind about its value.\"[79] Hill, Jones, and Farrington, the Savannah law firm where Thomas had interned the previous summer, offered him a job upon graduation, but he declined.[80][81] With no job offers from major law firms, Thomas took a position as an associate with Missouri attorney general John Danforth, who offered him the prospect of practicing what he liked.[82] Thomas moved to Saint Louis to study for the Missouri bar, and was admitted on September 13, 1974.[83] He remained financially destitute even after leaving Yale, trying unsuccessfully on one occasion to make money by selling his blood at a blood bank, and hoped that by working for Danforth he might later acquire a job in private practice.[84][85] From 1974 to 1977, Thomas was an assistant attorney general of Missouri—the only African-American member of Danforth's staff. He worked first in the office's criminal appeals division and later in the revenue and taxation division. Thomas conducted lawsuits independently, gaining a reputation as a fair but controversial prosecutor.[86] Years later, after he joined the Supreme Court, Thomas recalled his position in Missouri as \"the best job I've ever had\".[87] When Danforth was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1976, Thomas left to become an attorney in Monsanto's legal department in Saint Louis.[88] He found the job unsatisfying, so left to rejoin Danforth in Washington, D.C., as a legislative assistant.[89] From 1979 to 1981, he handled energy issues for the Senate Commerce Committee. Thomas, who had switched his party affiliation from Democratic to Republican while working for Danforth in Missouri,[90] soon drew the attention of officials in the newly elected Reagan Administration as a black conservative.[90][91] Pendleton James, Reagan's personnel director, offered Thomas the position of assistant secretary for civil rights at the U.S. Department of Education. Initially reluctant, Thomas agreed after Danforth and others pressed him to take the post.[92] President Ronald Reagan nominated Thomas as assistant secretary of education for the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) on May 1, 1981.[93][94] The Senate received the nomination on May 28, 1981, and Thomas was quickly confirmed before the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee on June 19, succeeding Cynthia Brown at the age of 32.[95][96] He held the position for a brief period before James offered him a new position as chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), a promotion that Thomas believed, as with his position in the OCR, was because of his race.[97] After James consulted the President, Thomas hesitantly took up the chair with Reagan's approval.[98] Thomas chaired the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) from 1982 to 1990. As chairman, he was tasked with enforcing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in an agency that had been mutually resented by both Democrats and Republicans. He announced a reorganization of the EEOC and upgraded its record-keeping under an uncompromising leadership that eschewed racial quotas.[97][99] Concerned by the EEOC's limited statutory authority, Thomas sought to impose criminal penalties for employers who practiced employment discrimination, moving to shift funding towards agency investigators. Though he had been critical of affirmative action, Thomas also opposed the Reagan Administration's agenda to remove affirmative action policies, believing it to be a detraction from socioeconomic issues.[100][90] During Thomas's tenure, he was credited with improving the efficiency of the EEOC.[101] Settlement award amounts to victims of discrimination tripled, while the number of suits filed decreased. The EEOC's lack of the use of goals and timetables drew criticism from civil rights advocates, who lobbied representatives to review the EEOC's practices; Thomas testified before Congress more than 50 times. Near the end of his final term, the EEOC came under congressional scrutiny for the mishandling of age-discrimination cases.[102][103] In early 1989, President George H. W. Bush expressed interest in nominating Thomas to a federal judgeship. Thomas, now at age 41, initially rejected the position, believing himself unready to make a lifetime commitment to being a judge. White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray and White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu advocated for his nomination, and Judge Laurence Silberman advised Thomas to accept an appointment.[104] Anticipating Thomas's nomination, a liberal coalition—including the Alliance for Justice and the National Organization for Women (NOW)—emerged to oppose his candidacy.[105] On October 30, 1989, President George H. W. Bush nominated Thomas to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to fill the seat vacated by Robert Bork.[106][107] Thomas gained the support of other African American officials, including former transportation secretary William Coleman, and said that when meeting white Democratic staffers in the United States Senate, he was \"struck by how easy it had become for sanctimonious whites to accuse a black man of not caring about civil rights\".[65] In February 1990, the Senate Judiciary Committee recommended Thomas by a vote of 12 to 1. On March 6, 1990, the Senate confirmed him to the Court of Appeals by a vote of 98 to 2.[105] He developed cordial relationships during his 19 months on the federal court, including with Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg.[65] During his judgeship, Thomas authored 19 opinions.[108] When Justice William Brennan retired from the Supreme Court in July 1990, Thomas was Bush's favorite among the five candidates on his shortlist for the position. However, Bush's advisors, including Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, considered Thomas inexperienced,[111] and he instead nominated David Souter of the First Circuit Court of Appeals.[65] A year later, Justice Thurgood Marshall announced his retirement on June 27, 1991, and Bush nominated Thomas to replace him.[112][113] Bush announced his selection on July 1, calling Thomas the \"best qualified at this time\".[65] Thornburgh cautioned Bush that replacing Marshall with any candidate who was not perceived to share Marshall's views would make confirmation difficult.[114] Liberal interest groups sought to challenge Thomas's nomination by paralleling the same strategy used against Robert Bork's confirmation.[115] Abortion-rights groups, including the National Abortion Rights Action League and the NOW, were concerned that Thomas would be among those to overrule Roe v. Wade.[116] Republican officials in turn emphasized his personal history and gathered support from African American interest groups, including the NAACP.[117] Other civil rights organizations, such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the National Urban League, were convinced not to oppose Thomas, believing that he was Bush's last black nominee. On July 31, 1991, the board of directors of the NAACP voted against endorsing Thomas, announcing their opposition to his confirmation the same day.[118] The American Bar Association (ABA) appraised Thomas as \"qualified\" for the Supreme Court.[119][b] The result came in contrast to the \"well qualified\" rating some nominees had received previously.[121][122] The Bush Administration anticipated that the organization would rate Thomas more poorly than it thought he deserved, so pressured the ABA for at least the mid-level qualified rating while simultaneously discrediting it as partisan.[123] Opponents of Thomas's nomination saw the assessment as indicating that he was unfit for the Court.[124] The ABA gave Thomas its highest rankings in integrity and judicial temperament and a middle-grade in professional competence.[125] On September 10, 1991, formal confirmation hearings began before the Senate Judiciary Committee.[126][127] Thomas testified for 25 hours, the second-longest of any Supreme Court nominee.[128] He was reticent when answering senators' questions, recalling what had happened to Robert Bork when Bork expounded on his judicial philosophy during his confirmation hearings four years earlier.[129] As many of his earlier writings frequently referenced natural law, his views on the legal theory became a focus of the hearings. Thomas said he regarded natural law as a \"philosophical background\" to the Constitution.[130][131][132] Ninety witnesses testified in favor of or against Thomas.[133][citation needed] A motion on September 27, 1991, to give the nomination a favorable recommendation failed 7–7, and the Judiciary Committee voted 13–1 to send it to the full Senate without recommendation.[134][135][136] At the conclusion of the committee's confirmation hearings, the Senate was debating whether to give final approval to Thomas's nomination. An FBI interview with Anita Hill, a former colleague of Thomas at the EEOC, was soon leaked to the press and allegations of sexual harassment followed.[137][138] As a result, on October 8, the final vote was postponed, and the confirmation hearings were reopened. It was only the third time in the Senate's history that such an action was taken and the first since 1925, when Justice Harlan F. Stone's nomination was recommitted to the Judiciary Committee.[136] Hill was raised in Oklahoma and, like Thomas, graduated from Yale Law School.[139] She told James Brudney, a fellow Yale alumnus, about alleged sexual advances Thomas had made, telling him that she also did not wish to testify or make the allegations public to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Hill requested to the staff of Senator Joe Biden, the chair of the committee, that her allegations be made anonymously if she chose to testify and that Thomas not be informed of them, which Biden declined. Hill then notified Democratic staffers the day after the hearings had ended that she wished to make her allegations known to the committee.[140] Hill's allegations were corroborated by Susan Hoerchner, a judge in California, who also wished to remain anonymous.[141][142] Hoerchner called Harriet Grant, a chief counsel to Biden, to inform him of her allegations. She recalled that Thomas told Hill in an elevator at the EEOC that he would ruin her career if she spoke about his behavior.[143] When Grant told Hill and Hoerchner that the FBI would be involved, they were reluctant to be investigated. Hill declined to speak with the FBI, as she feared it would misconstrue her words, so instead arranged to deliver a written statement. The statement described how Thomas pressured her to date him, and included descriptions of him speaking about sexual interests involving pornographic films.[144] Hill also alleged that Thomas spoke of sex at work despite her being uncomfortable with the subject, adding, \"I sensed that my discomfort with his discussions only urged him on, as though my reaction of feeling ill at ease and vulnerable was what he wanted\".[145] The FBI report of its investigation was not made public. The White House announced that the FBI had found the allegations \"without foundation\". Congressional officials who had seen the report told the New York Times that \"the bureau could not draw any conclusion because of the 'he said, she said' nature of the subject\".[146][147] The use of the FBI was contentious in the Judiciary Committee because it answers to the president, who was sponsoring Thomas. Biden used the FBI instead of the committee's investigators to avoid the appearance of partisanship.[148] The hearings reconvened on October 11, 1991, with Thomas going first. In his opening statement, he denied that he had said or done anything to Hill \"that could have been mistaken for sexual harassment\". He told the Committee that he would not allow any questions about \"what goes on in the most intimate parts of my private life or the sanctity of my bedroom\" so as not to \"provide the rope for my own lynching\".[149] The committee then questioned Hill for seven hours. She testified that ten years earlier Thomas had subjected her to comments of a sexual nature, calling it \"behavior that is unbefitting an individual who will be a member of the Court\".[150][151][152] Her testimony included graphic details, and some senators questioned her aggressively.[153][154] Hill accused Thomas of making two sexually offensive remarks to her: comparing his penis to that of Long Dong Silver, a black porn star, and saying he had discovered a pubic hair on his Coca-Cola can.[155][156] And from my standpoint as a black American, as far as I'm concerned, [this proceeding] is a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks that in any way deign to think for themselves, to do for themselves, to have different ideas, and it is a message that unless you kowtow to the old order, this is what will happen to you. You will be lynched, destroyed, caricatured by a committee of the United States Senate rather than hung from a tree. In the evening, Thomas was recalled before the committee. He again denied the allegations and was prompted by Senator Orrin Hatch's questioning to launch a speech that criticized the proceeding as a \"high-tech lynching for uppity blacks\".[158] The speech resonated with Southern blacks and stimulated Thomas's supporters,[159] with public opinion shifting in his favor afterward.[160][161] Hill was the only person to publicly testify that Thomas had sexually harassed her.[162] Angela Wright, who worked under Thomas at the EEOC and had alleged that \"Thomas had continually pressured her to date him and made sexual comments about women's bodies\",[163][164] and a corroborating witness she had named were not called to testify.[163] Their written depositions were entered into the congressional records unrebutted.[165][166][167] Sukari Hardnett, a former Thomas assistant, wrote to the Senate committee that although Thomas had not harassed her, \"If you were young, black, female and reasonably attractive, you knew full well you were being inspected and auditioned as a female.\"[168][169] In addition to Hill and Thomas, the committee heard other witnesses.[136] A former colleague, Nancy Altman, testified that for two years she had shared an office with Thomas at the Department of Education and \"heard virtually every conversation\" Thomas had and never heard him make a sexist or offensive comment.[170][non-primary sources needed] On October 13, Hill voluntarily took and passed a polygraph test, which her lawyer took as proof that she had been truthful about the harassment claims, even if the test was not admissible as evidence in court. Danforth's office then issued a statement saying that persons suffering from a delusional disorder might pass a lie detector test.[171][172][173][174] After the confirmation hearings ended, they became a focus of divided scholarship, with authors who revisited them reaching varying conclusions in favor of either Thomas or Hill.[161] On October 15, 1991, the Senate voted to confirm Thomas as an associate justice, 52–48.[136] Thomas received the votes of 41 Republicans and 11 Democrats, while 46 Democrats and two Republicans voted to reject his nomination.[175] As of 2024[update], Thomas is the most recent Supreme Court justice to be confirmed by a Senate controlled by the opposing party of the appointing president. The 99 days during which Thomas's nomination was pending in the Senate was the second-longest of the 16 nominees receiving a final vote since 1975, second only to Bork's 108 days.[136] The vote to confirm Thomas was the narrowest margin for approval in more than 100 years.[176] Thomas received his commission on October 23 and took the prescribed constitutional and judicial oaths of office, becoming the Court's 106th justice.[177][c] He was sworn in by Justice Byron White in a ceremony initially scheduled for October 21, which was postponed because of the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist's wife, Natalie.[179][180][181] His first set of law clerks included future judges Gregory Katsas and Gregory Maggs and U.S. Ambassador Christopher Landau.[182][183] After joining the Supreme Court, Thomas emerged as a member of the Court's conservative wing.[184] He aligned himself with Justice Antonin Scalia, with whom he shared an originalist approach to constitutional interpretation, and sided with him in 92 percent of cases during his first 13 years on the bench.[d] Over time, Thomas and Scalia's jurisprudence separated,[e] with Thomas favoring stronger emphasis on the Constitution's original understanding and demonstrating greater willingness to overrule precedent.[192] His appointment represented a decline in the Court's liberal wing, which then comprised only Justices John Paul Stevens and Harry Blackmun.[193][194] In his early days on the Court, Thomas adopted a bold style of legal jurisprudence that alienated him from Justices Blackmun and Sandra Day O'Connor. He became the subject of intense media criticism for his decisions, including from figures that supported his appointment. Having previously experienced scrutiny during his confirmation hearings, Thomas believed in producing results without regard for his public image, a characteristic embodied in his lack of questions during oral arguments. His conservative approach moved O'Connor to take liberal positions but attracted Scalia. He formed a friendship with Justice Byron White, with whom he shared multiple interests, and found support from Justice David Souter.[195][196] Thomas is a proponent of original meaning, incorporating what had been Scalia's narrower approach to the doctrine and the original intent of the Framers of the Constitution, including those espoused in the Declaration of Independence. As a means to impartiality, he is an advocate of judicial restraint to limit judicial discretion.[197][f] Thomas has been the most-willing of all justices on the Court to overrule precedent; according to Scalia, \"he does not believe in stare decisis, period\".[200][201][g] By October 1, 2012, he had written 475 opinions, including 171 majority opinions, 138 concurrences, and 166 dissenting opinions—approximately 10 percent of the 1,772 cases the Court had decided since he was elevated.[203] In 2016, Thomas wrote nearly twice as many opinions as any other justice.[9] Thomas has been called the most conservative member of the Supreme Court,[196][204][205] though others gave Scalia that designation while they served on the Court together.[206][207] Thomas's influence, particularly among conservatives, was perceived to have significantly increased during Donald Trump's presidency,[208][209] and Trump appointed many of his former clerks to political positions and judgeships.[210][211][212] As the Supreme Court became more conservative, Thomas and his legal views became more influential on the Court.[213][214][215] This influence increased further by 2022, with Thomas authoring an opinion expanding Second Amendment rights and contributing to the Court's overruling of Roe v. Wade. He was also the most senior associate justice by that time.[216][217][218] Thomas believes the Court should not follow erroneous precedent, a view not currently held by other justices.[219] He has called to reconsider New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964), and criticized Roe v. Wade (1973) and Gideon v. Wainwright (1963). At a 2013 Federalist Society dinner, Judge Diane S. Sykes asked Thomas whether \"stare decisis doesn't hold much force for you?\" He responded, \"Oh, it sure does, but not enough to keep me from going to the Constitution\".[220][221] In 2019, The New York Times reported that data gathered by political scientist Stephen L. Wasby of the University at Albany found that Thomas wrote \"more than 250 concurring or dissenting opinions seriously questioning precedents, calling for their reconsideration or suggesting that they be overruled\".[220] In the 2010 gun regulation case McDonald v. City of Chicago, Thomas sought to repeal past precedents and insisted that \"stare decisis is only an 'adjunct' of our duty as judges to decide by our best lights what the Constitution means\".[222] In Gamble v. United States (2019), he joined the majority opinion, which revisited an exception to the Double Jeopardy Clause, writing separately to state his position against the Court's prevailing view of multi-factor analysis regarding whether to follow precedent:[223] In my view, if the Court encounters a decision that is demonstrably erroneous—i.e., one that is not a permissible interpretation of the text—the Court should correct the error, regardless of whether other factors support overruling the precedent. Federal courts may (but need not) adhere to an incorrect decision as precedent, but only when traditional tools of legal interpretation show that the earlier decision adopted a textually permissible interpretation of the law. A demonstrably incorrect judicial decision, by contrast, is tantamount to making law, and adhering to it both disregards the supremacy of the Constitution and perpetuates a usurpation of the legislative power.[224] In Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt (2019),[h] Thomas wrote the 5–4 decision overruling Nevada v. Hall (1979), which said states could be sued in courts of other states. In his majority opinion, he noted that stare decisis \"is not an inexorable command\". Thomas explicitly disavowed the concept of reliance interests as justification for adhering to precedent. In dissent from Hyatt III, Justice Breyer asked what other decisions might eventually be overruled, and suggested Roe v. Wade might be among them. Breyer stated that it is best to leave precedents alone unless they are widely seen as erroneous or become impractical.[225] Thomas has supported a broad interpretation of executive power and has theorized about its constitutional aspects.[9] In Hamdi v. Rumsfeld (2004),[i] he dissented from the majority opinion, arguing that courts should have had complete deference to the executive decision to determine that Yaser Esam Hamdi was an enemy combatant.[226] He wrote in Hamdi that the president does not have the singular authority to detain a citizen who was captured while in enemy service.[227] In addition, Thomas noted that \"structural advantages [of the Presidency] are most important in the national-security and foreign-affairs contexts\" and thus \"the Founders intended that the President have primary responsibility—along with the necessary power—to protect the national security and to conduct the nation's foreign relations\".[228] Thomas was one of three justices to dissent in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld (2006),[j] which concerned whether the president can establish military tribunals to try detained enemy combatants for war crimes conspiracy. As in Hamdi, he relied on The Federalist Papers in proposing that the president is responsible for protecting national security.[229][230] In Zivotofsky v. Kerry (2015), Thomas relied on the Articles of Confederation for his opinion. He wrote, \"the President is not confined to those powers expressly identified in [the Constitution]\", concluding that residual foreign affairs were vested in the president, not Congress.[231] Rather than finding the original intent or original understanding, Thomas wrote in the case that he sought the \"understanding of executive power [that] prevailed in America\" at the time of the founding.[232] In the Ninth Circuit case East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump (2018), which placed an injunction on the Trump administration's asylum policy, Thomas dissented from a denial of stay application. The Ninth Circuit imposed an injunction on the Trump administration's policy granting asylum only to refugees entering from a designated port of entry, ruling that it violated the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. Ninth Circuit Judge Jay Bybee's majority opinion concluded that denial of the ability to apply for asylum regardless of entry point is \"the hollowest of rights that an alien must be allowed to apply for asylum regardless of whether she arrived through a port of entry if another rule makes her categorically ineligible for asylum based on precisely that fact.\" Gorsuch, Alito, Kavanaugh also dissented in the decision to deny a stay to the Ninth Circuit's injunction.[233][234] Thomas views federalism as a foundational limit on federal power.[235] In interpreting congressional powers, he has defended strict constructionism—an approach Scalia rejected.[236] On September 24, 1999, Thomas delivered the Dwight D. Opperman Lecture at Drake University Law School on \"Why Federalism Matters\", saying that it was an essential safeguard to protect \"individual liberty and the private ordering of our lives\". He also asserted that federalism enhances self-government, protects individual liberty by separating political power, and checks federal authority.[237] According to law professor Ann Althouse, the Court has yet to move toward \"the broader, more principled version of federalism propounded by Justice Thomas\".[238] Nothing in the Constitution deprives the people of each State of the power to prescribe eligibility requirements for the candidates who seek to represent them in Congress. The Constitution is simply silent on this question. And where the Constitution is silent, it raises no bar to action by the States or the people. — Thomas, dissenting in U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton (1995)[239][235] In the 1995 case U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton,[k] parties challenged the constitutionality of an amendment to the Arkansas Constitution that added age, citizenship, and residency requirements for congressional service. In a 5–4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled the amendment unconstitutional, also affirming the previous rulings of both the state's trial court and the Arkansas Supreme Court; Justice Stevens wrote for the majority. Thomas—joined by Justices Rehnquist, O'Connor, and Scalia—dissented in what is to date his lengthiest opinion.[240] He argued that states could impose term limits on members of Congress, as state citizens are \"the ultimate source of the Constitution's authority\".[241] That same year, Thomas concurred in United States v. Lopez, which invalidated the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 for going beyond the Commerce Clause. He opined that the Court had deviated \"from the original understanding of the Commerce Clause\" and that the substantial effects test, \"if taken to its logical extreme, would give Congress a 'police power' over all aspects of American life\".[242] Thomas dissented in Gonzales v. Raich (2005), which held that the Controlled Substances Act applies to homegrown marijuana, on the grounds of original meaning.[243] His interpretation of the interstate commerce clause differed from Scalia's, and they also held conflicting beliefs about the general welfare clause, the Indian commerce clause, and the necessary and proper clause. Scalia joined the majority opinion, but Thomas disputed the relevance of homegrown marijuana to interstate commerce, writing that if Congress can regulate it, \"it can regulate virtually anything—and the Federal Government is no longer one of limited and enumerated powers\".[244][245] In United States v. Comstock (2010),[l] the Supreme Court, in a majority opinion by Justice Stephen Breyer, held that the Necessary and Proper Clause allows Congress to enact a law that authorized the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to detain a mentally ill and dangerous federal prisoner beyond the DOJ's original lawful date. Thomas's dissent, joined by Scalia, argued that the clause allows Congress only to execute enumerated powers.[246] When the Court upheld the Affordable Care Act in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius (2012), he authored a short dissent and joined the joint dissent finding the act completely unconstitutional.[247] As of 2007, Thomas was the justice most willing to exercise judicial review of federal statutes but among the least likely to overturn state statutes.[248] According to a New York Times editorial, \"from 1994 to 2005 ... Justice Thomas voted to overturn federal laws in 34 cases and Justice Scalia in 31, compared with just 15 for Justice Stephen Breyer\".[249] In Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Holder, Thomas was the sole dissenter, voting to throw out Section Five of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Section Five requires states with a history of racial voter discrimination—mostly states from the old South—to gain Justice Department clearance when revising election procedures. Congress had reauthorized Section Five in 2006 for another 25 years, but Thomas said the law was no longer necessary, stating that the rate of black voting in seven Section Five states was higher than the national average. He wrote, \"the violence, intimidation and subterfuge that led Congress to pass Section 5 and this court to uphold it no longer remains.\"[250] He took this position again in Shelby County v. Holder, voting with the majority and concurring with the reasoning that struck down Section Five.[251] Thomas has generally written opinions in favor of protections for free speech.[252][253] He has voted in favor of First Amendment claims in cases involving issues including campaign contributions and commercial speech.[254] A 2002 study by Eugene Volokh found Thomas to be the justice second-most likely to uphold free speech claims (tied with Souter).[255] He has ruled against laws regulating hate speech, as in R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul (1992), United States v. Stevens (2010), and Snyder v. Phelps (2011).[256] Conversely, he has been reluctant to uphold speech deemed intimidating, as in Virginia v. Black (2003).[257][258] Thomas's first opinion on free speech was the 1995 case McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission,[m] finding that the Founding Era contained the expansive use of anonymous pamphlets and columns. Although he agreed with the result of Justice John Paul Stevens's majority opinion, he disagreed with its methodology and did not join it.[259] With the announcement of McIntyre, the Court also decided Rubin v. Coors Brewing Company, in which Thomas wrote his first majority opinion concerning free speech. In Rubin, Thomas was joined unanimously in ruling unconstitutional a 1935 federal law that prohibited beer labels from disclosing alcohol content. He similarly concurred the next year in 44 Liquormart v. Rhode Island, which struck down a state law that banned the advertisement of prices of alcoholic beverages.[260] In Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC (1996), the Supreme Court ruled against the decision of the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to fine the Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee for running a political advertisement targeting Senator Tim Wirth. Thomas joined Justice Stephen Breyer's majority opinion in the case, but wrote separately to call against the framework established in the previous campaign finance case of Buckley v Valeo (1976): I believe that contribution limits infringe as directly and as seriously upon freedom of political expression and association as do expenditure limits. The protections of the First Amendment do not depend upon so fine a line as that between spending money to support a candidate or group and giving money to the candidate or group to spend for the same purpose. In principle, people and groups give money to candidates and other groups for the same reason that they spend money in support of those candidates and groups: because they share social, economic, and political beliefs and seek to have those beliefs affect governmental policy.[261] Thomas has made public his belief that all limits on federal campaign contributions are unconstitutional and should be struck down.[262] In Citizens United v. FEC (2010), Thomas joined the majority but dissented in part, arguing that the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act's disclaimer and disclosure requirements were unconstitutional. He reinforced his defense of anonymous speech in Doe v. Reed (2010), writing that the First Amendment protects \"political association\" by means of signing a petition.[263] In Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District (1969), Justice Hugo Black dissented from the Court's opinion invalidating a school's policy to forbid students from wearing armbands in protest of the Vietnam War. Thomas endorsed Black's dissent in Morse v. Frederick (2007), concurring with narrowing the rationale of Tinker and arguing that Tinker be overruled as it was a constitutionally unsupported \"sea change in students’ speech rights\".[264] In his view, the Constitution does not govern whether public school students may be disciplined for expressive behavior.[265] In Mahanoy Area School District v. B.L.—in which a high school punished a student for sending a profane message on social media about her school, softball team, and cheer team—Thomas was the lone dissenter, siding with the school. He criticized the majority for relying on \"vague considerations\" and wrote that historically schools could discipline students in similar situations.[266] In Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans, he joined the majority opinion that Texas's decision to deny a request for a Confederate Battle Flag specialty license plate was constitutional.[267] Thomas agreed with the judgment in McDonald v. Chicago (2010) that the right to keep and bear arms is applicable to state and local governments, but he wrote a separate concurrence finding that an individual's right to bear arms is fundamental as a privilege of American citizenship under the Privileges or Immunities Clause rather than as a fundamental right under the due process clause.[268] The four justices in the plurality opinion specifically rejected incorporation under the privileges or immunities clause, \"declin[ing] to disturb\" the holding in the Slaughter-House Cases, which, according to the plurality, had held that the clause applied only to federal matters.[269][270] Since 2010, Thomas has dissented from denial of certiorari in several Second Amendment cases. He voted to grant certiorari in Friedman v. City of Highland Park (2015), which upheld bans on certain semi-automatic rifles; Jackson v. San Francisco (2014), which upheld trigger lock ordinances similar to those struck down in Heller; Peruta v. San Diego County (2016), which upheld restrictive concealed carry licensing in California; and Silvester v. Becerra (2017), which upheld waiting periods for firearm purchasers who have already passed background checks and already own firearms. He was joined by Scalia in the first two cases, and by Gorsuch in Peruta.[271][272][273][274] Thomas dissented from the denial of an application for a stay presented to Chief Justice Roberts in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit case Guedes v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (2019), a case challenging the Trump administration's ban on bump stocks. Only Thomas and Gorsuch publicly dissented.[275] Thomas authored the majority opinion in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen (2022), guaranteeing the right of law-abiding citizens to carry firearms in public. The case held: \"When the Second Amendment's plain text covers an individual's conduct, the Constitution presumptively protects that conduct. The government must then justify its regulation by demonstrating that it is consistent with the Nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation. Only then may a court conclude that the individual's conduct falls outside the Second Amendment's 'unqualified command.'\" Justice Stephen Breyer, dissenting, wrote, \"when courts interpret the Second Amendment, it is constitutionally proper, indeed often necessary, for them to consider the serious dangers and consequences of gun violence that lead States to regulate firearms.\"[276] Thomas was the sole dissenter in United States v. Rahimi. In Rahimi, the Court was tasked with deciding whether 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(8) (a federal statute that prohibits people subject to a domestic restraining order from possessing guns during the time they are subject to the order and imposes up to 15 years' imprisonment for each violation) is unconstitutional on its face. The other eight justices found that the statute could be applied constitutionally, but Thomas argued that the surety, affray, and \"going armed\" laws the government proffered were not sufficient analogies to §922(g)(8) for many reasons, including that historical surety laws did not actually disarm people but only required them to post a bond that would be forfeited if they breached the peace, and that affray laws targeted violence that occurred in public, not private interpersonal violence within the home.[277][278][279] In cases regarding the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, Thomas often favors police over defendants. For example, his opinion for the Court in Board of Education v. Earls upheld drug testing for students involved in extracurricular activities, and he wrote again for the Court in Samson v. California, permitting random searches on parolees. He dissented in Georgia v. Randolph, which prohibited warrantless searches that one resident approves and the other opposes, arguing that the Court's decision in Coolidge v. New Hampshire controlled the case. In Indianapolis v. Edmond, Thomas described the Court's extant case law as having held that \"suspicionless roadblock seizures are constitutionally permissible if conducted according to a plan that limits the discretion of the officers conducting the stops.\" He expressed doubt that those cases were decided correctly but concluded that since the litigants in the case at bar had not briefed or argued that the earlier cases be overruled, he believed that the Court should assume their validity and rule accordingly.[280] Thomas was in the majority in Kyllo v. United States, which held that the use of thermal imaging technology to probe a suspect's home without a warrant violated the Fourth Amendment. In cases involving schools, Thomas has advocated greater respect for the doctrine of in loco parentis,[281] which he defines as \"parents delegat[ing] to teachers their authority to discipline and maintain order\".[282] His dissent in Safford Unified School District v. Redding illustrates his application of this postulate in the Fourth Amendment context. School officials in the Safford case had a reasonable suspicion that 13-year-old Savana Redding was illegally distributing prescription-only drugs. All the justices concurred that it was therefore reasonable for the school officials to search Redding, and the main issue before the Court was only whether the search went too far by becoming a strip search or the like.[282] All the justices except Thomas concluded that the search violated the Fourth Amendment. The majority required a finding of danger or reason to believe drugs were hidden in a student's underwear in order to justify a strip search. Thomas wrote, \"It is a mistake for judges to assume the responsibility for deciding which school rules are important enough to allow for invasive searches and which rules are not\"[283] and \"reasonable suspicion that Redding was in possession of drugs in violation of these policies, therefore, justified a search extending to any area where small pills could be concealed\". He added, \"[t]here can be no doubt that a parent would have had the authority to conduct the search.\"[282] In Doggett v. United States, the defendant had technically been a fugitive from the time he was indicted in 1980 until his arrest in 1988. The Court held that the delay between indictment and arrest violated Doggett's Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial, finding that the government had been negligent in pursuing him and that he was unaware of the indictment.[284] Thomas dissented, arguing that the Speedy Trial Clause's purpose was to prevent \"'undue and oppressive incarceration' and the 'anxiety and concern accompanying public accusation'\" and that the case implicated neither.[284] He cast the case instead as \"present[ing] the question [of] whether, independent of these core concerns, the Speedy Trial Clause protects an accused from two additional harms: (1) prejudice to his ability to defend himself caused by the passage of time; and (2) disruption of his life years after the alleged commission of his crime\". Thomas dissented from the court's decision to, as he saw it, answer the former in the affirmative.[284] He wrote that dismissing the conviction \"invites the Nation's judges to indulge in ad hoc and result-driven second guessing of the government's investigatory efforts. Our Constitution neither contemplates nor tolerates such a role\".[285] In Garza v. Idaho, Thomas and Gorsuch, in dissent, suggested that Gideon v. Wainwright (1963), which required that indigent criminal defendants be provided counsel, was wrongly decided and should be overruled.[220] Thomas was among the dissenters in Atkins v. Virginia and Roper v. Simmons, which held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the application of the death penalty to certain classes of persons. In Kansas v. Marsh, his majority opinion indicated a belief that the Constitution affords states broad procedural latitude in imposing the death penalty, provided they remain within the limits of Furman v. Georgia and Gregg v. Georgia, the 1976 case in which the Court reversed its 1972 ban on death sentences if states followed procedural guidelines.[citation needed] In Hudson v. McMillian, a prisoner had been beaten by respondent prison guards, sustaining a cracked lip, broken dental plate, loosened teeth, cuts, and bruises. The Court held that \"the use of excessive physical force against a prisoner may constitute cruel and unusual punishment even though the inmate does not suffer serious injury.\"[286] Dissenting, Thomas wrote, \"a use of force that causes only insignificant harm to a prisoner may be immoral, it may be tortious, it may be criminal, and it may even be remediable under other provisions of the Federal Constitution, but it is not 'cruel and unusual punishment'. In concluding to the contrary, the Court today goes far beyond our precedents.\"[286] Thomas's vote—in one of his first cases after joining the Court—was an early example of his willingness to be the sole dissenter (Scalia later joined the opinion).[287] His opinion was criticized by the seven-member majority, which wrote that, by comparing physical assault to other prison conditions such as poor prison food, it ignored \"the concepts of dignity, civilized standards, humanity, and decency that animate the Eighth Amendment\".[286] According to historian David Garrow, Thomas's dissent in Hudson was a \"classic call for federal judicial restraint, reminiscent of views that were held by Felix Frankfurter and John M. Harlan II a generation earlier, but editorial criticism rained down on him\".[288] Thomas later responded to the accusation \"that I supported the beating of prisoners in that case. Well, one must either be illiterate or fraught with malice to reach that conclusion ... no honest reading can reach such a conclusion.\"[288] In United States v. Bajakajian, Thomas joined with the Court's liberal justices to write the majority opinion declaring a fine unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. The fine was for failing to declare more than $300,000 in a suitcase on an international flight. Under a federal statute, 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1), the passenger would have had to forfeit the entire amount. Thomas noted that the case required a distinction to be made between civil forfeiture and a fine exacted with the intention of punishing the respondent. He found that the forfeiture in this case was clearly intended as a punishment at least in part, was \"grossly disproportional\" and violated the Excessive Fines Clause.[289] Thomas has written that the \"Cruel and Unusual Punishment\" clause \"contains no proportionality principle\", meaning that the question whether a sentence should be rejected as \"cruel and unusual\" depends only on the sentence itself, not on what crime is being punished.[290] He concurred with the Court's decision to reject a request for review from a petitioner who had been sentenced to 25 years to life in prison under California's \"Three-Strikes\" law for stealing golf clubs because the combined value of the clubs made the theft a felony and he had two previous felonies in his criminal record.[non-primary source needed] Thomas believes the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids consideration of race, such as race-based affirmative action or preferential treatment. In Adarand Constructors v. Peña, he wrote, \"there is a 'moral [and] constitutional equivalence' between laws designed to subjugate a race and those that distribute benefits on the basis of race in order to foster some current notion of equality. Government cannot make us equal; it can only recognize, respect, and protect us as equal before the law. That [affirmative action] programs may have been motivated, in part, by good intentions cannot provide refuge from the principle that under our Constitution, the government may not make distinctions on the basis of race.\"[291] In Gratz v. Bollinger, Thomas wrote, \"a State's use of racial discrimination in higher education admissions is categorically prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause.\"[292] In Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1, Thomas joined the opinion of Chief Justice Roberts, who wrote that \"[t]he way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\"[293] Concurring, Thomas wrote, \"if our history has taught us anything, it has taught us to beware of elites bearing racial theories\", and charged that the dissent carried \"similarities\" to the arguments of the segregationist litigants in Brown v. Board of Education.[293] Thomas joined the majority in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, which struck down affirmative action in college admissions. He filed a concurring opinion, which he read from the bench, a rare practice for Supreme Court justices.[294] Thomas has contended that the Constitution does not address abortion.[295] In Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), the Court reaffirmed Roe v. Wade. Thomas and Justice Byron White joined the dissenting opinions of Rehnquist and Scalia. Rehnquist wrote, \"[w]e believe Roe was wrongly decided, and that it can and should be overruled consistently with our traditional approach to stare decisis in constitutional cases.\"[296] Scalia's opinion concluded that the right to obtain an abortion is not \"a liberty protected by the Constitution of the United States\".[296] \"[T]he Constitution says absolutely nothing about it,\" Scalia wrote, \"and [ ] the longstanding traditions of American society have permitted it to be legally proscribed\".[296] In Stenberg v. Carhart (2000), the Court struck down a state ban on partial-birth abortion, concluding that it failed Casey's \"undue burden\" test. Thomas dissented, writing, \"Although a State may permit abortion, nothing in the Constitution dictates that a State must do so.\"[297] He went on to criticize the reasoning of the Casey and Stenberg majorities: \"The majority's insistence on a health exception is a fig leaf barely covering its hostility to any abortion regulation by the States—a hostility that Casey purported to reject.\" In Gonzales v. Carhart (2007), the Court rejected a facial challenge to a federal ban on partial-birth abortion.[298] Concurring, Thomas asserted that the court's abortion jurisprudence had no basis in the Constitution but that the court had accurately applied that jurisprudence in rejecting the challenge.[298] He added that the Court was not deciding the question of whether Congress had the power to outlaw partial-birth abortions: \"[W]hether the Act constitutes a permissible exercise of Congress's power under the Commerce Clause is not before the Court [in this case] ... the parties did not raise or brief that issue; it is outside the question presented; and the lower courts did not address it.\"[298] In December 2018, Thomas dissented when the Court voted not to hear cases brought by Louisiana and Kansas to deny Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood.[299] Alito and Gorsuch joined Thomas's dissent, arguing that the Court was \"abdicating its judicial duty\".[300] In February 2019, Thomas joined three of the Court's other conservative justices in voting to reject a stay to temporarily block a law restricting abortion in Louisiana.[301] The law that the court temporarily stayed, in a 5–4 decision, would have required that doctors performing abortions have admitting privileges in a hospital.[302] In Box v. Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Inc. (2019), a per curiam decision upholding the provision of Indiana's abortion restriction regarding fetal remains disposal on rational basis scrutiny and upholding the lower court rulings striking down the provision banning race, sex, and disability, Thomas wrote a concurring opinion comparing abortion and birth control to eugenics, which was practiced in the U.S. in the early 20th century and by the Nazi government in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s, and comparing Box to Buck v. Bell (1927), which upheld a forced sterilization law regarding people with mental disabilities. In his opinion, Thomas quoted Margaret Sanger's support for contraception as a form of personal reproductive control that she considered superior to \"the horrors of abortion and infanticide\" (Sanger's words).[303][non-primary source needed] His opinion referred several times to historian/journalist Adam Cohen's book Imbeciles: The Supreme Court, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck; shortly afterward, Cohen published a sharply worded criticism saying that Thomas had misinterpreted his book and misunderstood the history of the eugenics movement.[304] In Box, only Thomas, Sonia Sotomayor, and Ginsburg publicly registered their votes. Ginsburg and Sotomayor concurred in part and dissented in part, stating they would have upheld the lower court decision on striking down the race, sex, and disability ban as well as the lower court decision striking down the fetal remains disposal provision.[303] In a concurring opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization (2022), Thomas wrote that \"any substantive due process decision is 'demonstrably erroneous'\",[305] and argued that the Supreme Court should go beyond Roe vs. Wade and reconsider other substantive due process precedents, including those established in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), Lawrence v. Texas (2003) and Obergefell v. Hodges (2015). The overturning of these previous decisions would enable states to limit access to contraception, criminalize sodomy, and criminalize same-sex marriage, respectively.[306][307][308] In Romer v. Evans (1996), Thomas joined Scalia's dissenting opinion arguing that Amendment Two to the Colorado State Constitution did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The Colorado amendment forbade any judicial, legislative, or executive action designed to protect persons from discrimination based on \"homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual orientation, conduct, practices or relationships\".[309] In Lawrence v. Texas (2003), Thomas issued a one-page dissent in which he called the Texas statute prohibiting sodomy \"uncommonly silly\", a phrase originally used by Justice Potter Stewart. He then said that if he were a member of the Texas legislature he would vote to repeal the law, as it was not a worthwhile use of \"law enforcement resources\" to police private sexual behavior. But Thomas opined that the Constitution does not contain a right to privacy and therefore did not vote to strike the statute down. He saw the issue as a matter for states to decide for themselves.[310] In Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia (2020), Thomas joined Alito and Kavanaugh in dissenting from the decision that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects employees against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. (Alito wrote a dissent that Thomas joined, and Kavanaugh dissented separately.) The 6–3 ruling's majority consisted of two Republican-appointed justices, Roberts and Gorsuch, along with four Democratic-appointed justices: Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan.[311] In October 2020, Thomas joined the other justices in denying an appeal from Kim Davis, a county clerk who refused to give marriage licenses to same-sex couples, but wrote a separate opinion reiterating his dissent from Obergefell v. Hodges and expressing his belief that it was wrongly decided.[312][313][314] In July 2021, he was one of three justices, with Gorsuch and Alito, who voted to hear an appeal from a Washington florist who had refused service to a same-sex couple based on her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage.[315][316][317] In November 2021, Thomas dissented from the majority of justices in a 6–3 vote to reject an appeal from Mercy San Juan Medical Center, a hospital affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, which had sought to deny a hysterectomy to a transgender patient on religious grounds.[318] Alito and Gorsuch also dissented, and the vote to reject the appeal left in place a lower court ruling in the patient's favor.[319][320] During a 10-year period from February 2006 to February 2016, Thomas read his opinions from the bench but asked no questions during oral arguments.[321][322] By May 2020, he had asked questions in two oral arguments since 2006 and had spoken during 32 of the roughly 2,400 arguments since 1991.[323][324] Thomas has given many reasons for his silence, including self-consciousness about how he speaks, a preference for listening to those arguing the case, and difficulty getting in a word.[325] He said in 2013 that it was \"unnecessary in deciding cases to ask that many questions ... we should listen to lawyers who are arguing their cases, and I think we should allow the advocates to advocate.\"[325] His speaking and listening habits may have been influenced by his Gullah upbringing, during which his English was relatively unpolished.[17][63][326] In a 2017 paper in Northwestern University Law Review, RonNell Andersen Jones and Aaron L. Nielson wrote that while asking few questions, \"in many ways, [Thomas] is a model questioner.\"[327][328] Thomas took a more active role in questioning when the Supreme Court shifted to holding teleconferenced arguments in May 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, in which the justices took turns asking questions in order of seniority.[329][330][331][324] Since the court resumed in-person oral arguments at the beginning of the 2021 term, the justices agreed to allow Thomas to ask the first question of each lawyer following their opening statements.[332] In 1971, Thomas married Kathy Grace Ambush. The couple had one child, Jamal Adeen, born in 1973, who is Thomas's sole child. Thomas and his first wife separated in 1981 and divorced in 1984.[333][334] In 1987, Thomas married Virginia Lamp, a lobbyist and aide to U.S. Representative Dick Armey.[335] In 1997, they took in Thomas's six-year-old great-nephew, Mark Martin Jr.,[336] who had lived with his mother in Savannah public housing.[337] Since 1999, Thomas and his wife have traveled across the U.S. in a motorcoach between Court terms.[338][339] Virginia \"Ginni\" Thomas has remained active in conservative politics, serving as a consultant to The Heritage Foundation and as founder and president of Liberty Central.[340] In 2011, she stepped down from Liberty Central to open a conservative lobbying firm, touting her \"experience and connections\", meeting with newly elected Republican representatives and calling herself an \"ambassador to the Tea Party\".[341][342] Also in 2011, 74 Democratic members of the House of Representatives wrote that Justice Thomas should recuse himself on cases regarding the Affordable Care Act because of \"appearance of a conflict of interest\" based on his wife's work.[343] The Washington Post reported in February 2021 that Ginni Thomas apologized to a group of Thomas's former clerks on the email listserv \"Thomas Clerk World\" for her role in contributing to a rift relating to \"pro-Trump postings and former Thomas clerk John Eastman, who spoke at the rally and represented Trump in some of his failed lawsuits filed to overturn the election results\".[344] In March 2022, texts between Ginni Thomas and Trump's chief of staff Mark Meadows from 2020 were turned over to the Select Committee on the January 6 Attack.[345] The texts show Ginni Thomas repeatedly urging Meadows to overturn the election results and repeating conspiracy theories about ballot fraud.[346] In response, 24 Democratic members of the House of Representatives and the Senate demanded that Thomas recuse himself from cases related to efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and the January 6 attack at the U.S. Capitol on the grounds that Ginni Thomas's involvement in such efforts raised questions about his impartiality.[347] An April 2022 Quinnipiac poll found that 52% of Americans agreed that, in light of Ginni Thomas's texts about overturning the results of the 2020 presidential election, Thomas should have recused himself from related cases.[348] Thomas was reconciled to the Catholic Church in the mid-1990s.[349] In his autobiography, he criticized the church for failing to grapple with racism in the 1960s during the civil rights movement, saying it was not so \"adamant about ending racism then as it is about ending abortion now\".[350] As of 2021, Thomas is one of 14 practicing Catholic justices in the Court's history and one of six currently serving (along with Alito, Kavanaugh, Roberts, Sotomayor, and Barrett).[351] In 1975, when Thomas read economist Thomas Sowell's Race and Economics, he found an intellectual foundation for his philosophy.[352][353] The book criticizes social reform by government and argues for individual action to overcome circumstances and adversity. Ayn Rand's works also influenced him, particularly The Fountainhead, and he later required his staffers to watch the 1949 film version of the novel.[354][355] Thomas acknowledges \"some very strong libertarian leanings\", though he does not consider himself a libertarian.[356] Thomas has said novelist Richard Wright is the most influential writer in his life; Wright's books Native Son and Black Boy \"capture[d] a lot of the feelings that I had inside that you learn how to repress\".[333] Native Son and Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man are Thomas's two favorite novels.[191] In 2016, Moira Smith, vice-president and general counsel of a natural gas distributor in Alaska, said that Thomas groped her buttocks at a dinner party in 1999. She was a Truman Foundation scholar helping the director of the foundation set up for a dinner party honoring Thomas and David Adkins. Smith's roommates at the time confirmed that she had told them about the incident. Thomas denied the allegation.[357][358] Louis Blair, who was the head of the Truman Foundation and hosted the dinner at his home, said he had \"no recollection of the incident\" and that he had neither seen nor heard of Smith's allegation. Blair acknowledged that he was in the kitchen most of the time so, if the incident happened, he wouldn't have seen it, but was also \"skeptical that the justice and Moira would have been alone\", given that there were approximately 16 people in three rooms.[359][360] Norma Stevens, who attended the event, said that the incident \"couldn't have happened\" because Thomas was never alone, as he was the guest of honor.[361] In 2004, the Los Angeles Times reported that Thomas had accepted gifts from Harlan Crow, a wealthy Dallas-based real estate investor and prominent Republican donor, including a Bible that once belonged to abolitionist Frederick Douglass and a bust of Abraham Lincoln.[362][363] Crow also gave Thomas a portrait of the justice and his wife, according to the painter, Sharif Tarabay. Crow's foundation gave $105,000 to Yale Law School, Thomas's alma mater, for the \"Justice Thomas Portrait Fund\", tax filings showed.[364] Spousal income and connections to cases has been redacted from the Justices' ethical disclosure forms.[365] In 2011, Politico reported that Crow gave $500,000 to a Tea Party group founded by Thomas's wife and that Thomas had failed to report her income on his disclosure for more than a decade.[366][367] Also that year, the advocacy group Common Cause reported that between 2003 and 2007, Thomas failed to disclose $686,589 in income his wife earned from The Heritage Foundation, instead reporting \"none\" where \"spousal noninvestment income\" would be reported on his Supreme Court financial disclosure forms.[368] The next week, Thomas said the disclosure of his wife's income had been \"inadvertently omitted due to a misunderstanding of the filing instructions\".[369] He amended reports going back to 1989.[370] In April 2023, ProPublica reported that Thomas had \"accepted luxury trips virtually every year\" from Crow for two decades and failed to report them. They included flights on Crow's private jet, international cruises on Crow's superyacht, and stays at Crow's private resort in the Adirondacks and the private club Bohemian Grove.[364][371][367] The Ethics in Government Act requires justices, judges, members of Congress and federal officials to annually disclose gifts they receive.[372] Many elected officials criticized the appearance of impropriety, given Crow's donations to conservative causes and Republican candidates, and his service on the board of trustees for the American Enterprise Institute and the Hoover Institution, which have filed amicus briefs before the Supreme Court.[373][364] In May 2023, ProPublica reported that Crow had paid for private school tuition for Thomas's grandnephew, Mark Martin, of whom Thomas had legal custody. Thomas did not report the payments on his financial disclosure forms, while ethics law experts said that they were required to be disclosed as gifts. Mark Paoletta, a longtime friend of Thomas, said that Crow paid for one year each at Hidden Lake and Randolph-Macon Academy, which ProPublica estimated to be worth around $100,000.[374][367] On the same day, The Washington Post reported that in January 2012 conservative judicial activist Leonard Leo had Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway's polling firm bill the Judicial Education Project $25,000, which her firm then paid to Ginni Thomas's firm, Liberty Consulting, for a total of $80,000 between June 2011 and June 2012. Leo instructed Conway not to mention Thomas's name on the paperwork. The documents the newspaper reviewed did not indicate the nature of the work Thomas did for the Judicial Education Project or Conway's company. In 2012 the Judicial Education Project filed a brief to the Supreme Court in a landmark voting rights case.[375][367] In 2023, The New York Times reported that a friend had paid for Thomas's Prevost Le Mirage XL Marathon RV, purchased for $267,230 in 1999 (roughly equivalent to $489,000 in 2023). Anthony Welters, a former UnitedHealthcare executive and a close friend, lent Thomas the purchase price. In response to a Senate inquiry, Welters revealed that the loan was discharged in 2008, forgiving much of the original balance. A bank would have been unlikely to offer such a loan, given the Marathon's high capacity for customization, which can make used models difficult to appraise. Thomas had previously said that he \"had scrimped and saved to afford the motor coach\", according to the Times, and a friend, Armstrong Williams, said that Thomas had told him that \"he saved up all his money to buy it\". When the loan was forgiven, Thomas was required to disclose the money as a gift.[376][377][378][367][379] In June 2024, Thomas filed an amendment to his financial disclosure report for 2019 to include information he had \"inadvertently omitted\". The amendment disclosed that he had received food and lodging at a hotel in Bali and a private club in California from Harlan Crow in July 2019.[380][381] He did not report travel to and from the destinations on private jets or the nine-day cruise on Crow's superyacht.[380][381] In 2023, both the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate Finance Committee opened investigations into Thomas's undisclosed gifts.[382][383] The two committees found additional undisclosed travel on Crow's private jet and superyacht, including international trips in 2010 and domestic trips in 2017, 2019, and 2021.[382][384] In 2023, in response to Thomas's nondisclosures, Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats called on Chief Justice Roberts to open an investigation into Thomas's conduct.[385] On December 21, 2024, Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee released a report revealing that Thomas had taken an additional two trips in 2021 paid for by Crow.[386] Fix the Court released an analysis showing that, over the 20 years beginning in 2004, Thomas had accepted gifts worth $4.2 million, based on reporting by ProPublica and others.[387][388][389] It estimated that over the same 20 years, the other eight justices plus the eight retired or deceased justices received gifts worth roughly $600,000 combined.[389] On January 3, 2025, the U.S. Judicial Conference announced it will not refer Thomas to the Justice Department over ethics allegations, denying a request from Senators Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Ron Wyden of Oregon. U.S. District Judge Robert Conrad, the Conference Secretary of the Judicial Conference, cited legal uncertainty regarding the Conference's authority to make a criminal referral regarding a Supreme Court justice.[390][391] Thomas was awarded the 1992 Horatio Alger Award by the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans.[392] In 2001, Thomas was awarded the Francis Boyer Award presented by the American Enterprise Institute.[393] In 2012, Thomas received an honorary degree from the College of the Holy Cross, his alma mater.[394] He was a member of the college's board of trustees in 1990, and also from 2004 to 2006.[395] In 2020, Belmont Abbey College awarded him the Benedict Leadership Award for his devotion to the Catholic faith and government service.[396]",

And what he learned as a child had a life-long impact.</span> Why Clarence Thomas Rarely Speaks from the Supreme Court Bench Chip Somodevilla|Getty Images Clarence Thomas is a powerful, yet often-silent orator. The reason may surprise some who forget he was born in poverty. Clarence Thomas hadn't asked a question from the bench of the U.S. Supreme Court in 10 years , not until late February after the death of his colleague Antonin Scalia. He'd been questioned often about this. Journalists from nearly every major news organization on the planet repeatedly raised the topic in their stories about major cases before the high court (like Citizens United, which Thomas is somewhat responsible for). Once he did speak, it became major headlines for days. But why does Thomas usually remain silent? Jeff NesbitMarch 28, 2016 The high court's most controversial justice has offered an explanation just once – but it is a fairly extraordinary one. Progressives routinely dismiss it – or any sort of interpretation of what it means – but it's an interesting answer and shouldn't be dismissed so quickly or easily. The reason he's silent from the bench – a practice that first began during law school – has to do with his formative years, he told The New York Times 15 years ago. Until he was 6, Thomas lived in deep poverty in the lowcountry in Pin Point, Georgia. Like nearly every black child who grows up in Gullah-Geechee homes in the lowcountry – which includes communities descended from plantation slaves primarily in Georgia and South Carolina, but with roots in northern Florida and southern North Carolina – he spoke Gullah at home. For years, Gullah was considered to be \"pidgin English\" – corrupted or badly spoken English that whites generally dismissed as the language of the uneducated. But Gullah isn't that, scholars have proven. Gullah is a beautiful language, with a rich heritage. Some of the stories from the Gullah tradition have made their way into popular culture in America, though most people don't realize the origin. Br'er Rabbit and his briar patch is a Gullah story. The next time you sing \"Kumbayah\" proudly, with emotion and feeling, you can thank Gullah at the end of the song. \"In the 1700s, rice plantations flourished along the coastal areas and barrier islands stretching from North Carolina to Florida. Because they required specific skills, slaves were brought here from similar environments in Africa, where rice had been grown successfully for centuries,\" syndicated columnist Fyllis Hockman wrote in 2013. \"In many cases the Africans' knowledge of rice cultivation far exceeded that of their masters. Because the work required a wide variety of skills that only the Africans possessed, they were often accorded more responsibility and autonomy than their cotton-picking counterparts.\" USN&WR \"They came with their own language, beliefs and customs — and because they were so isolated in coastal regions that were not connected to the mainland until the 1950s, their Gullah culture flourished and proliferated among the many Africans who came to settle there, and it still endures today,\" she wrote. These slaves also had to learn how to communicate with slaves from other parts of the world who didn't necessarily know their West African dialect. They needed to learn enough English to satisfy the demands of their white masters, while simultaneously communicating with one another in ways those same white masters might not recognize. Gullah emerged from those twin demands. It is a pure example of prevailing in the face of nearly impossible odds and, when descendants of slaves in the lowcountry speak Gullah in their homes today, it is a reflection of their heritage and ability to overcome adversity. But Thomas doesn't see it that way. All he remembers is what many children from Gullah-Geechee homes learn quickly when they go to public school: You can speak Gullah, the language of your ancestors, in your home. But don't speak Gullah in public schools, especially around white people. If you do, you'll be branded as poor, uneducated and disadvantaged. So Thomas stopped speaking Gullah in public. And he largely stopped speaking publicly at all, he told the New York Times, for fear that any trace of that former life in Pin Point would somehow work its way into his speech. \"When I was 16, I was sitting as the only black kid in my class, and I had grown up speaking a kind of a dialect ... called Geechee. Some people call it Gullah, and people praise it now. But they used to make fun of us back then. It's not standard English,\" the Supreme Court justice told the Times. Jeff NesbitMarch 29, 2016 \"So I learned that, and I just started developing the habit of listening. And it just got to be, I didn't ask questions in college or law school,\" he said. \"For all those reasons and a few others, I just think that it's more in my nature to listen rather than to ask a bunch of questions. The only reason I could see for asking the questions is to let people know I've got something to ask. That's not a legitimate reason in the Supreme Court of the United States.\" Most progressives and observers of Thomas' actions on the high court, however, dismiss this explanation. \"Thomas bears the scars of yet another black prejudice: not only was he too black, he was also culturally too backcountry,\" Howard University sociology professor Orlando Patterson wrote in his 2007 review of Kevin Merida and Michael A. Fletcher's exhaustive biography, \"Supreme Discomfort: The Divided Soul of Clarence Thomas.\" \"Coastal Georgia is one of the few areas in America where a genuinely Afro-English creole — Gullah — is used, and Thomas grew up speaking it. In Savannah he was repeatedly mocked for his 'Geechee' accent and was so traumatized by this that he developed the habit of simply listening when in public,\" he wrote. \"That experience, Thomas claims, helps explain his mysterious silence on the Supreme Court during oral arguments. This seems a stretch, since Thomas is now an eloquent public speaker and an engaging conversationalist who, like most educated Southerners north of home, erased his accent long ago.\" Patterson doesn't offer another explanation for Thomas' silence on the bench of the high court; neither do other journalists, analysts, or observers. But what if Thomas' simple explanation – that he's ashamed of his roots in poverty, expressed through the language of his ancestors – actually makes the most sense? Andre Chung|MCT via Getty Images Ophelia Grant of Georgia Gullah/Geechee Shouters of McIntosh County, Ga., performs in Washington, D.C., Jan. 23, 2011. Interestingly, Thomas shares his Gullah heritage with first lady Michelle Obama. Like Thomas, Mrs. Obama has deep Gullah connections. She may not have grown up in the lowcountry but, unlike Thomas, Mrs. Obama doesn't distance herself from her Gullah roots. She displays them proudly. In fact, she went out of her way to incorporate Gullah into her husband's 2013 inauguration celebration. A float in the inauguration parade included a quilt that told the story of her ties to the Gullah culture. Mrs. Obama's ancestors were slaves at the Friendfield Plantation in Georgetown, South Carolina. One of the dignitaries who rode on that 2013 float in the Obama inauguration – Robert Macdonald, the director emeritus of the Museum of the City of New York – was astounded the then-new Gullah-Geechee Heritage Commission was given such a place in the spotlight. \"For such a young organization, it's rather startling in a way,\" Macdonald told the Charleston Post and Courier. \"I think it reflects the interest in preserving the diversity of American culture and history, which has made this country unique.\" One reason the float made its appearance is almost certainly due to the insistence of U.S. Rep. James Clyburn (D-S.C.), who has fought for greater national recognition of the Gullah heritage. Clyburn, who was instrumental in the creation of the Gullah national commission in the first place, wrote the commission to see if it was interested in taking part, and then to the inauguration committee itself to see that it was included, pointing out Mrs. Obama's connection to the Gullah-Geechee culture. The celebration of Gullah heritage is, finally, starting to take hold in America. Journalists have started to dig into the history, culture, roots and absorbing history behind Gullah along the coastline of the United States. Scholars like J. Herman Blake, a sociologist from the University of South Carolina,—Beaufort, are working to preserve decades of the Gullah heritage before it's forgotten. Blake said it's important to capture what Gullah was like a century ago since, as in all things, the language has changed in the decades since it was born. People tend to speak Gullah privately in their homes, and English in public. But it's starting to be forgotten, even in Gullah homes. And because some, like Clarence Thomas, dismiss it as a relic of poverty that must be abandoned in public, it causes communities to distance themselves from it further. \"The Geechee people of Sapelo don't understand Gullah-Geechee that well themselves anymore, and it's a different kind of speech,\" Blake wrote in The Black Scholar, describing recordings made in the 1930s by the first African-American linguist, Lorenzo Dow Turner. \"So this is the first time they are hearing Gullah-Geechee spoken the way it was 70 years ago. So it's a matter of tuning your ear to the older stage of the language. The differences between life on the island in the 1930s and today also present difficulties. They are talking about their daily lives 70 years ago and their lives were much different than what they are today…the words they used are quite different.\" Gullah – and what it means today – is a complicated tapestry for people to grasp. Some, like Clarence Thomas, run away from it. Others, like Mrs. Obama, embrace it. But what is absolutely essential is that we talk about these sorts of things publicly.

                "content": "Clarence Thomas (born June 23, 1948) is the Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.[2] Thomas has been a Justice since 1991. He is the second African American to serve on the court, after Thurgood Marshall. During his confirmation process, Professor Anita Hill accused Thomas of sexual harassment. Regardless, Thomas was confirmed in October 1991. Clarence Thomas was born in Pin Point, Georgia.[3] His father left his family when he was only two years old.[4] He did not meet his son Clarence again until Clarence was nine years old.[5] This left his mother, Leola Anderson, to take care of the family. Clarence and his brother were sent to live with his mother's parents in Savannah, Georgia.[6] His grandfather wanted him to become a priest. Thomas was sent to St. John Vianney Minor Seminary, an all-white boarding school near Savannah.[3] In 1968 he transferred to the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts.[7] He gave up all ideas of becoming a priest after the death of Martin Luther King Jr.. Thomas then obtained a law degree at Yale University.[7] After Yale he returned to Missouri and worked for State Attorney General, John Danforth.[3] in 1977 Danforth was elected to the U.S. Senate. Thomas became a corporate lawyer for the Monsanto Company. Two years later he became Danforth's legislative aide in Washington, D.C..[3] President Ronald Reagan offered Thomas a job as the assistant secretary for civil rights in the U.S. Department of Education.[3] He then became the chairman of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Thomas was appointed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1990 by President George H. W. Bush.[3] In 1991, Thurgood Marshall retired from the Supreme Court. Bush nominated Thomas to replace him.[3] He had a hard time getting approved so that he could become a Supreme Court justice. This was partly because one of his former employees, Anita Hill, claimed that he sexually harassed her.[8] Thomas said that was not true. The Senate confirmed his nomination by a vote of 52-48. All Republicans, except Bob Packwood of Oregon and James Jeffords of Vermont, voted for confirmation.[9]",

                "content": "TIME | The Washington Post | ABC News | Variety | The New York Times | Forbes A documentary on Justice Clarence Thomas '71 entitled \"Created Equal: Clarence Thomas in His Own Words,\" which was released in select theaters on January 31, is set to air nationally on PBS this May.The documentary gives viewers an inside look into the personal life of the Supreme Court Justice and Holy Cross alumnus, showing how he rose from humble beginnings to now holding a seat on the highest court in the land. The release of the documentary has been highly anticipated, with notable outlets from TIME, The Washington Post, The New York Times and ABC News lauding the film’s insight and exclusive access to the notoriously private Justice.Justice Clarence Thomas graduated from the College of the Holy Cross in 1971, as one of the first African-American students recruited to attend the college by Fr. John Brooks, S.J., and as a founding member of the school’s Black Student Union. An English major at the College, Thomas was also a member of Alpha Sigma Nu and the Purple Key Society.Following his graduation, Thomas went on to receive his J.D. from Yale Law, worked in several prominent firms, and rose in the judicial ranks to become the longest-sitting judge currently on the Supreme Court. Back in 2012, Thomas received an honorary degree from Holy Cross in recognition of his legal career, service to the College as a former trustee, and especially to students who study in the Washington Semester Program, and his tenure on the nation's highest court.For more information on the documentary, go to JusticeThomasMovie.com.

                "title": "La Liga - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Campeonato Nacional de Liga de Primera División,[a] commonly known as the Primera División[b] or La Liga[c][2] and officially known as LaLiga EA Sports[d][3] since 2023 because of sponsorship reasons, is the top men's professional football division of the Spanish football league system. It is controlled by the Liga Nacional de Fútbol Profesional and it is contested by 20 teams over a 38-matchday period. Since its inception, 62 teams have competed in La Liga. Nine teams have been crowned champions, with Barcelona winning the inaugural La Liga and Real Madrid winning the title a record 36 times. Real Madrid are also the most recent winners, having won the 2023–24 edition. During the 1940s Valencia, Atlético Madrid and Barcelona emerged as the strongest clubs, winning several titles. Real Madrid and Barcelona dominated the championship in the 1950s, each winning four La Liga titles during the decade. During the 1960s and 1970s, Real Madrid dominated La Liga, winning fourteen titles, with Atlético Madrid winning four.[4] During the 1980s and 1990s Real Madrid were prominent in La Liga, but the Basque clubs of Athletic Bilbao and Real Sociedad had their share of success, each winning two Liga titles. From the 1990s onward, Barcelona has dominated La Liga, winning seventeen titles to date.[5] Although Real Madrid has also been prominent, winning eleven titles, La Liga has also seen other champions, including Valencia and Deportivo La Coruña. According to UEFA's league coefficient rankings, La Liga was the top league in Europe in each of the seven years from 2013 to 2019 (calculated using accumulated figures from five preceding seasons) and led Europe for 22 of the 60 ranked years up to 2019, more than any other country. It also has produced the continent's top-rated club more times (22) than any other league in that period, more than double that of second-placed Serie A (Italy), including the top club in 10 of the 11 seasons between 2009 and 2019; each of these pinnacles was achieved by either Barcelona or Real Madrid. La Liga clubs have won the most UEFA Champions League (20), UEFA Europa League (14), UEFA Super Cup (16) and FIFA Club World Cup (8) titles, and its players have accumulated the highest number of Ballon d'Or awards (24), The Best FIFA Men's Player awards (19)[e] and UEFA Men's Player of the Year awards (12).[f] La Liga is one of the most popular professional sports leagues globally, with an average attendance of 26,933 for league matches in the 2018–19 season.[6] This is the eighth-highest of any domestic professional sports league in the world and the third-highest of any professional association football league in the world, behind fellow big five leagues Bundesliga and Premier League, and above Serie A and Ligue 1.[7][8] La Liga is also the seventh wealthiest professional sports league in the world by revenue, after the NFL, MLB, the NBA, the Premier League, the NHL, and the Bundesliga.[9] From 2008 to 2016, it was sponsored by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria and known as Liga BBVA. Then, from 2016 to 2023, it was sponsored by Banco Santander and known as LaLiga Santander. Since 2023, it has been sponsored by Electronic Arts and is known as LaLiga EA Sports. The competition format follows the usual double round-robin format. During the course of a season, which lasts from August to May, each club plays every other club twice, once at home and once away, for 38 matches. Teams receive three points for a win, one point for a draw, and no points for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, with the highest-ranked club crowned champion at the end of the season. A system of promotion and relegation exists between the Primera División and the Segunda División. The three lowest placed teams in La Liga are relegated to the Segunda División, and the top two teams from the Segunda División promoted to La Liga, with an additional club promoted after a series of play-offs involving the third, fourth, fifth and sixth placed clubs. Below is a complete record of how many teams played in each season throughout the league's history; If points are equal between two or more clubs, the rules are:[10] The top four teams in La Liga qualify for the subsequent season's UEFA Champions League group stage. The winners of the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League also qualify for the subsequent season's UEFA Champions League group stage. The fifth place team in La Liga and the winner of the Copa del Rey also qualify for the subsequent season's UEFA Europa League group stage. However, if the winner also finished in the top five places in La Liga, then this place reverts to the team that finished sixth in La Liga. Furthermore, the sixth place (or seventh if sixth already qualifies due to the Copa del Rey) team qualifies for the subsequent season's UEFA Conference League play-off round.[12] The number of places allocated to Spanish clubs in UEFA competitions is dependent upon the position a country holds in the UEFA country coefficients, which are calculated based upon the performance of teams in UEFA competitions in the previous five years. As of the end of the 2023–24 season, the ranking of Spain (and de facto La Liga) is second.[13] In April 1928, José María Acha, a director at Arenas de Getxo, first proposed the idea of a national league in Spain. After much debate about the size of the league and who would take part, the Real Federación Española de Fútbol eventually agreed on the ten teams who would form the first Primera División in 1929. Arenas, Barcelona, Real Madrid, Athletic Bilbao, Real Sociedad and Real Unión were all selected as previous winners of the Copa del Rey. Atlético Madrid, Espanyol and Europa qualified as Copa del Rey runners-up and Racing de Santander qualified through a knockout competition. Only three of the founding clubs (Real Madrid, Barcelona, and Athletic Bilbao) have never been relegated from the Primera División. Although Barcelona won the first Liga in 1929 and Ricardo Zamora's Real Madrid won their first titles in 1932 and 1933, it was Athletic Bilbao that set the early pace winning La Liga in 1930, 1931, 1934 and 1936 (in addition to four Copa trophies), and they also achieved the biggest win in La Liga history by beating Barcelona 12-1; This team, coached by Fred Pentland, is known by the nickname First historic squad, notably forming an attacking partnership with Bata, Guillermo Gorostiza, José Iraragorri, Chirri II and Lafuente. In 1935, Real Betis, then known as Betis Balompié, won their only title to date. Primera División was suspended during the Spanish Civil War. In 1937, the teams in the Republican area of Spain, with the notable exception of the two Madrid clubs, competed in the Mediterranean League and Barcelona emerged as champions. Seventy years later, on 28 September 2007, Barcelona requested the Royal Spanish Football Federation (Spanish acronym RFEF) to recognise that title as a Liga title. This action was taken after RFEF was asked to recognise Levante's Copa de la España Libre win as equivalent to Copa del Rey trophy. Nevertheless, the governing body of Spanish football has not made an outright decision yet. When the Primera División resumed after the Spanish Civil War, it was Atlético Aviación (nowadays Atlético Madrid), Valencia, and Barcelona that emerged as the strongest clubs. Atlético were only awarded a place during the 1939–40 season as a replacement for Real Oviedo, whose ground had been damaged during the war. The club subsequently won its first Liga title and retained it in 1941. While other clubs lost players to exile, execution, and as casualties of the war, the Atlético team was reinforced by a merger. The young, pre-war squad of Valencia had also remained intact and in the post-war years matured into champions, gaining three Liga titles in 1942, 1944, and 1947. They were also runners-up in 1948 and 1949. Athletic Bilbao was one of the clubs most affected by the war, since many of its players (sympathizers of the Republican faction) went into exile in Latin America and very few returned. But thanks to a search for young talents, they managed to form the well-known Second historic squad made up of Rafael Iriondo, Venancio Pérez, José Luis Panizo, Agustín Gaínza and the mythical scorer Telmo Zarra (Spanish top scorer in La Liga history, among other records). They won a La Liga and Copa del Generalísimo double in 1943 and won the Cup again in 1944, 1945 and 1950, in addition to an Copa Eva Duarte (official predecessor of the Supercopa). Sevilla also enjoyed a brief golden era, finishing as runners-up in 1940 and 1942 before winning their only title to date in 1946. Meanwhile, on the other side of Spain, Barcelona began to emerge as a force under the legendary Josep Samitier. A Spanish footballer for both Barcelona and Real Madrid, Samitier cemented his legacy with Barcelona. During his playing career with Barcelona he scored 133 goals, won the inaugural La Liga title and five Copa Del Rey. In 1944, Samitier returned to Barcelona as a coach and guided them in winning their second La Liga title in 1945. Under Samitier and legendary players César Rodríguez, Josep Escolà, Estanislau Basora and Mariano Gonzalvo, Barcelona dominated La Liga in the late 1940s,[14] winning back to back La Liga titles in 1948 and 1949. The 1940s proved to be a successful season for Barcelona, winning three La Liga titles and one Copa Del Rey, but the 1950s proved to be a decade of dominance, not just from Barcelona, but from Real Madrid. Although Atlético Madrid, previously known as ''Atlético Aviación'', were champions in 1950 and 1951 under mastermind Helenio Herrera, the 1950s continued the success FC Barcelona had during the late 1940s. During this decade, FC Barcelona's first golden era emerged under coach Ferdinand Daučík, winning back-to-back La Liga and Copa Del Rey doubles in 1951–52 and 1952–53. In 1952, FC Barcelona made history yet again by winning five distinctive trophies in one year. This team, composed of László Kubala, Mariano Gonzalvo, César Rodríguez Álvarez, and Joan Segarra, won La Liga, Copa Del Rey, Copa Eva Duarte (predecessor of Spanish Super Cup), Latin Cup and Copa Martini & Rossi. Their success in winning five trophies in one year earned them the name 'L’equip de les cinc Copes'[15] or The Team of the Five Cups. In the latter parts of the 1950s, coached by Helenio Herrera and featuring Luis Suárez, Barcelona won yet again back-to-back La Liga's, winning them in 1959 and 1960. In 1959, Barcelona also won another double of La Liga / Copa Del Rey, conquering three doubles in the 1950s. The 1950s also saw the beginning of the Real Madrid dominance. During the 1930s through the 1950s there were strict limits imposed on foreign players. In most cases, clubs could have only three foreign players in their squads, meaning that at least eight local players had to play in every game. During the 1950s, however, these rules were circumvented by Real Madrid who naturalised Alfredo Di Stéfano and Ferenc Puskás.[citation needed] Di Stéfano, Puskás, Raymond Kopa and Francisco Gento formed the nucleus of the Real Madrid team that dominated the second half of the 1950s. Real Madrid won their third La Liga in 1954 — their first since 1933 — and retained their title in 1955. In 1956, Athletic Bilbao won their sixth La Liga title, but Real Madrid won La Liga again in 1957 and 1958. All in all, Barcelona and Real Madrid won four La Liga titles each in the 1950s, with Atlético Madrid winning two and Athletic Bilbao winning one during this decade. Real Madrid dominated La Liga between 1960 and 1980, being crowned champions 14 times.[16] Real Madrid won five La Liga titles in a row from 1961 to 1965 as well as winning three doubles between 1960 and 1980. During the 1960s and 1970s, only Atlético Madrid offered Real Madrid any serious challenge. Atlético Madrid were crowned La Liga champions four times in 1966, 1970, 1973, and 1977. Atlético Madrid also finished second place in 1961, 1963, and 1965. In 1971, Valencia won their fourth La Liga title in 1971 under Alfredo Di Stéfano, and the Johan Cruyff-inspired Barcelona won their ninth La Liga in 1974. Real Madrid's monopoly in La Liga was interrupted significantly in the 1980s. Although Real Madrid won another five La Liga titles from 1986 to 1990[17] under the brilliance of Emilio Butragueño and Hugo Sánchez, the Basque clubs of Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao also dominated the 1980s.[18] Real Sociedad won their first La Liga titles in 1981 and 1982; Luis Arconada, Roberto López Ufarte and Txiki Begiristain stood out from this team. Later, Athletic Bilbao also managed to win two consecutive La Liga titles in 1983 and 1984, also achieving their fifth La Liga and Copa del Rey double in 1984; The stars Andoni Zubizarreta, Santi Urkiaga, Andoni Goikoetxea, Dani, Manuel Sarabia and Estanislao Argote made this success possible. For its part, Barcelona won their tenth La Liga title in 1985 under coach Terry Venables, their first La Liga win since 1974. Johan Cruyff returned to Barcelona as manager in 1988, and assembled the legendary Dream Team.[19] When Cruyff took control of his Barcelona side, they had won only two La Liga titles in the past 20 years. Cruyff decided to build a team composed of international stars and La Masia graduates in order to restore Barcelona to their former glory days. This team was formed by international stars Romario, Michael Laudrup, Hristo Stoichkov and Ronald Koeman. Cruyff's Dream Team also consisted of La Masia graduates Pep Guardiola, Albert Ferrer and Guillermo Amor, as well as Basque Andoni Zubizarreta. Johan Cruyff changed the way modern football was played,[20] and incorporated the principles of Total Football into this team. The success of possession-based football was revolutionary,[21] and Cruyff's team won their first European Cup in 1992 and four consecutive La Liga titles between 1991 and 1994. In total, Cruyff won eleven trophies in eight years, making him the most successful manager in Barcelona's history, until the record was broken by his protégé Pep Guardiola two decades later. Barcelona's run ended with Real Madrid winning La Liga in 1995. Atlético Madrid won their ninth La Liga title in 1996, as well as their only Liga/Copa Del Rey double, before Real Madrid added another league title to their cabinet in 1997. After the success of Cruyff, another Dutchman – Ajax manager, Louis van Gaal – arrived at the Camp Nou, and with the talents of Luís Figo, Luis Enrique, and Rivaldo, Barcelona won the La Liga title in 1998 and 1999, including their fourth double of Liga and Copa Del Rey in 1998. All in all, Barcelona won six La Liga titles in the 1990s. The 21st century continued the success Barcelona had in the 1990s under Johan Cruyff, dominating La Liga. Although Real Madrid had been prominent, Barcelona created a hegemony in Spain not seen since the Real Madrid of the 1960s–70s.[22] Since the start of the new century, Barcelona won ten La Ligas, including two trebles and four doubles. This new century however has also seen new challengers being crowned champions. Between 1999–2000 and 2004, Deportivo La Coruña finished in the top three on five occasions, a better record than either Real Madrid or Barcelona, and in 2000, under Javier Irureta, Deportivo became the ninth team to be crowned champions. Valencia were one of the strongest teams in Europe in the early to mid 2000s; they were crowned La Liga champions in 2002 and 2004 under Rafael Benítez, whilst also being runners-up in the UEFA Champions League in 2000 and 2001 under Hector Cuper and winning the UEFA Cup in 2004 and the Copa del Rey in 1999. Real Madrid won their first Liga titles of the century in 2001 and 2003. With world-class players like Raúl, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Gonzalo Higuaín, Real Madrid won back-to-back La Liga titles in 2006–07 and 2007–08. Barcelona won their first title of the new century after Real Madrid and Valencia had shared the last four titles under the brilliance of Ronaldinho and Samuel Eto'o in the 2004–05 season. Barcelona retained the title to make it back-to-back wins in the 2005–06 season. In 2009–10, Real Madrid achieved a record 96 points but still finished behind Barcelona, who amassed 99 points. Barcelona then won a third straight La Liga title in the 2010–11 season with 96 points to Real's 92, but Real Madrid ended their winning streak in the 2011–12 season under the management of José Mourinho and with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Ángel Di María, Mesut Özil and Karim Benzema. Madrid won their 32nd La Liga title with a record 100 points, a record 121 goals scored and a record +89 goal difference. The following year, in the 2012–13 season, Barcelona won yet another La Liga title under coach Tito Vilanova, replicating the 100 points record Real Madrid achieved the previous year. Atlético Madrid, under the management of Diego Simeone, won their tenth La Liga title in 2013–14, their first since 1996. They became the first team since Valencia in 2004 to win La Liga and break Barcelona and Real Madrid's dominion over the league.[23] In the 2014–15 season, under the trio of Messi, Neymar, and Suarez nicknamed 'MSN', Barcelona made history by becoming the first team to achieve a second Treble, and winning a sixth Liga/Copa Del Rey double. Barcelona continued their dominance, and in the 2015–16 season they won a back-to-back Liga/Copa Del Rey double, something that had not been achieved since the 1950s.[24] Real Madrid brought back the La Liga title under the management of Zinedine Zidane in 2016–17, but Barcelona won the title again in the 2017–18 season, as well as winning their eighth double,[25] for seven La Liga titles in ten years. Barcelona retained the title yet again and won their 26th La Liga title in the 2018–19 season, for eight La Liga titles in eleven years.[26] Real Madrid reclaimed the title in 2019–20, winning the season that was severely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic.[27] The 2020–21 season started on 12 September, and was won by Atletico Madrid, with Real Madrid as runners-up.[28] In August 2021, La Liga clubs approved a €2.7 billion deal to sell 10% of the league to CVC Capital Partners.[29] The 2021–22 season was won by Real Madrid with four games to spare,[30] while the 2022–23 season was won by Barcelona with four games to spare. In 2023, La Liga rebranded itself with a new logo and new sponsor. EA (Electronic Arts) replaced the Spanish financial services giant Santander that was the title sponsor of the league for seven years. LaLiga EA Sports and LaLiga Hypermotion are the names of the Primera and Segunda Divisions, starting in the 2023-24 season and for the following four seasons.[31] Following the flash floods disaster that hit Spain at the end of October, claiming the lives of over 200 people, the Spanish league postponed all matches scheduled to be played in the Valencian region on Thursday. The games played after the floods opened in a moment of silence.[32] 20 teams already contest the league in its current season, including the top 17 sides from the 2023–24 season and three promoted from the 2023–24 Segunda División. Leganés and Real Valladolid were promoted directly, and Espanyol won the promotion play-off. The Primera División is currently third in the UEFA rankings of European leagues based on their performances in European competitions over a five-year period, behind England's Premier League and Italy's Serie A, but ahead of Germany's Bundesliga and France's Ligue 1. Real Madrid, Barcelona and Atlético Madrid have been in the top ten most successful clubs in European football in terms of total European trophies. These three clubs, along with Sevilla and Valencia, are the only Spanish clubs to have won five or more international trophies. Deportivo La Coruña are the joint fifth-most participating Spanish team in the Champions League with Sevilla — after Real Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia and Atlético Madrid — with five consecutive Champions League appearances, including a semi-finals appearance in 2003–04.[33] During the 2005–06 European season, La Liga became the first league to have its clubs win both the Champions League and UEFA Cup since 1997, as Barcelona won the UEFA Champions League and Sevilla won the UEFA Cup. This feat was repeated four times in five seasons: during the 2013–14 season Real Madrid won their tenth Champions League title and Sevilla won their third Europa League, during the 2014–15 season Barcelona won their fifth Champions League title and Sevilla won their fourth Europa League, during the 2015–16 season Real Madrid won their eleventh Champions League title and Sevilla won their fifth Europa League (becoming the first team to win the title three times in a row), and during the 2017–18 season Real Madrid won their thirteenth Champions League title and Atlético Madrid won their third Europa League. In 2015, La Liga became the first league to enter five teams in the Champions League group stage, with Barcelona, Real Madrid, Atlético Madrid and Valencia qualifying via their league position and Sevilla qualifying by virtue of their victory in the Europa League, courtesy of a rule change. In La Liga in 2020, each club is allowed five non-EU players but are only allowed to name three non-EU players in each matchday squad.[34] Players can claim citizenship from the nation their ancestors came from. If a player does not have European ancestry, he can claim Spanish citizenship after playing in Spain for five years. Sometimes, this can lead to a triple-citizenship situation; for example, Leo Franco, who was born in Argentina, is of Italian heritage yet can claim a Spanish passport, having played in La Liga for over five years. In addition, players from the ACP countries—countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement—are not counted against non-EU quotas due to the Kolpak ruling. Until the 2008–09 season, no official individual awards existed in La Liga. In the 2008–09 season, the governing body created the LFP Awards (now called La Liga Awards), awarded each season to individual players and coaches. The majority of these awards were discontinued after the 2015–16 season.[35] Additional awards relating to La Liga are distributed, some not sanctioned by the Liga de Futbol Profesional or RFEF and therefore not regarded as official. The most notable of these are four awarded by Spain's largest sports paper, Marca, namely the Pichichi Trophy, awarded to the top scorer of the season; the Ricardo Zamora Trophy, for the goalkeeper with the fewest goals allowed per game (minimum 28 games); the Alfredo Di Stéfano Trophy, for the player judged to be the best overall player in the division; and the Zarra Trophy, for the top scorer among Spanish domestic players. Since the 2013–14 season, La Liga has also bestowed the monthly manager of the month and player of the month awards. The first La Liga player to be involved in a transfer which broke the world record was Luis Suárez in 1961, who moved from Barcelona to Inter Milan for £152,000 (£4.3 million in 2023). 12 years later, Johan Cruyff was the first player to join a club in La Liga for a record fee of £922,000 (£14.1 million in 2023), when he moved from Ajax to Barcelona. In 1982, Barcelona again set the record by signing Diego Maradona from Boca Juniors for £5 million (£22 million in 2023).[36] Real Betis set the world record in 1998 when they signed Denílson from São Paulo for £21.5 million (£47.8 million in 2023).[37] Four of the last six world transfer records have been set by Real Madrid, signing Luís Figo,[38] Zinedine Zidane,[39] Cristiano Ronaldo[40] (plus a deal for Kaká days before Ronaldo[41] which fell just below a world record due to the way the fee was calculated)[42] and finally Gareth Bale, who was bought in 2013 for £85.3m (€103.4m or $140m at the time; £123.5m in 2023) from Tottenham Hotspur.[43] Brazilian forward Neymar was the subject of an expensive and complicated transfer arrangement when he joined Barcelona from Santos in 2013,[44][45] and his outgoing transfer to Paris Saint-Germain in 2017 set a new world record fee at €222m via his buyout clause.[46] Barcelona soon invested a large amount of the money received from this transfer in a replacement, Ousmane Dembélé, whose deal – €105m – was the second most expensive ever before Philippe Coutinho's transfer to Barcelona for €142m in January 2018.[47][48][49] Boldface indicates a player still active in La Liga.

Presidents Honours Press Releases Logos Image Gallery Institutional Calendar Documents Newsletter Contact Pressroom What is LALIGA? Presidents Honours Press Releases Logos Image Gallery Institutional Calendar Documents Newsletter Contact LALIGA is a global, innovative and socially responsible organisation, a leader in the leisure and entertainment sector. It is a private sports association composed of the 20 clubs and SADs (public limited sports companies) in LALIGA EA SPORTS and the 22 in LALIGA HYPERMOTION, responsible for the organisation of these national professional football competitions. With headquarters in Madrid (Spain), it is present in 41 countries through its 13 offices and 44 delegates. In the 2019/2020 season, LALIGA reached more than 2.8 billion people globally. The association carries out its social action through its Foundation and is the world's first pro essional football league with a league for intellectually challenged footballers: LALIGA Genuine. Since 2013 and Javier Tebas's appointment as president, LALIGA has embarked on a journey of growth and constant evolution based on financial controls, the centralised sale of audiovisual rights and a strategy of internationalisation and technological leadership. All of this has made the institution a role model within the sector and one of the best professional leagues within the world of sport, which is serving to attract the interest of new generations. In 2013, the debts held by the LALIGA clubs and SADs with the Spanish tax authorities (Hacienda) stood at €650 million and, two years prior to this, the number of complaints brought by players over non-payment of wages amounted to 341 and involved a total of €84m. The impact that the financial controls have had on the LALIGA clubs and SADs can be summarised as follows: All of this makes LALIGA more solvent, attractive and stronger, with this growth reflected in player salaries, which serves to improve the competitive level across the competition. In 2021, LALIGA’s Assembly approved the strategic agreement with investment fund CVC Capital Partners, in order to boost the global growth of LALIGA and its clubs. This is an ambitious investment plan that will provide LALIGA and its clubs resources that can continue the process of transformation, making this a global organisation of digital entertainment, strengthening the competition and enhancing the experience of fans. With this partnership, in which CVC valued LALIGA at €24,250 million, LALIGA will retain its sports responsibilities as well as the organisation and management of the marketing of the audiovisual rights. The participating clubs should use the funds in the following way: 70% for infrastructure, 15% for the restructuring of financial debt and 15% for the registration of players. LALIGA is responsible for the joint marketing of the audiovisual rights on behalf of the LALIGA EA SPORTS and LALIGA HYPERMOTION clubs and SADs. The audiovisual rights, which are valued at close to €2 billion per season in the current audiovisual cycle, represent the clubs' main source of revenue, exceeding 60% of revenue for the majority of clubs. The Royal Decree-Law 5/2015 establishes the criteria for the distribution of broadcasting revenue obtained from the joint exploitation and marketing of the audiovisual rights. Foreign interest in the Spanish game has grown exponentially in recent years. LALIGA works on a daily basis to promote Spanish football beyond the country's borders, with the objective of creating a community of fans throughout the world. LALIGA's global expansion is underpinned by the following three cornerstones: its international offices, the network of LALIGA Global Network delegates and the joint ventures it is working on in different areas of the world. LALIGA's international offices are located in: Meanwhile, the LALIGA Global Network delegates are based in destinations across the five continents. LALIGA is actively engaged in three strategic joint-venture partnerships: LALIGA's internationalisation efforts saw the institution named the Honorary Ambassador of Brand Spain in the international relations category in 2019, \"on account of its contribution to offering a positive image of Spain across the world through football\" and \"assisting the internationalisation of both Spanish companies and athletes.\" Innovation and technology currently represent one of the cornerstones of LALIGA's medium- and long-term growth. The clubs' association boasts a digital ecosystem that combines channels, services and data. The combination of these elements provides LALIGA with a complete overview, which the organisation uses to improve its audiovisual product for the benefit of supporters, sponsors, broadcasters and, of course, the clubs. LALIGA Tech is a subsidiary that brings together the technological solutions developed by LALIGA and that makes them available commercially to third parties, thereby generating a new line of business for the clubs/SADs. These digital tools have been worked on since 2013 by LALIGA, as the organisation looked for solutions to its particular needs. Now, through LALIGA Tech, these services are supplied to the entire sports and entertainment industry, with clients including World Padel Tour, Dorna Sports, Jupiler Pro League and Sky Mexico. One of the keys behind this project is the Business Intelligence & Analytics department, that has become the main axis of innovation at LALIGA thanks to a transformation process that made the organisation one built around data. The objective is to centralise, organise, prepare and provide all the necessary information in order for decisions to be made based on data and carried out efficiently. The following are examples of these technological tools, which help with decision-making and with daily tasks: One of LALIGA's priorities is the fight against sporting corruption and the promotion of good practice within football. The institution works on the following aspects in this field: Talks are delivered to all players and professionals at the LALIGA clubs, including the reserve teams, about integrity and the legal and administrative consequences of any possible involvement in match-fixing. Football matches across Spanish football are monitored on a 24/7 basis. LALIGA has developed Tyche 3.0, software that monitors and analyses global betting activity relating to Spanish football, for this purpose. The program uses machine learning algorithms to enable possible cases of match-fixing to be identified more quickly and in a more objective and effective manner. LALIGA is a member of the National Commission against the manipulation of sporting competitions and betting-related fraud, a body where it is joined by the following organisations: the General Directorate for the Regulation of Gaming, the National Police, the Civil Guard, the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) and online gaming operators. Another of LALIGA's main objectives concerns the battle against violence in and around football stadiums. To achieve this objective, LALIGA coordinates and collaborates with those responsible for security within the clubs and is a member of the National Commission against violence, racism, xenophobia and intolerance in sport and works very closely with the National Sports Office and the State Law Enforcement Agencies. LALIGA submits a weekly report to the RFEF's Competition Committee and the Anti-violence Committee with information regarding chants heard during matches that incite violence or feature content that is insulting or displays an attitude of intolerance. LALIGA is aware of the impact and influence that football has within society and, as such, pursues a strategic aim that sees the organisation lead ethical, social and environmental initiatives under the umbrella of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). LALIGA carries out its social outreach work through its Foundation, which was founded in 1993 and is a pioneer in the world of professional football. The LALIGA FOUNDATION's projects pursue the objective of transforming society through positive footballing values, such as integrity, hard work, self-improvement, collaboration and teamwork. The LALIGA FOUNDATION's activities can be divided up into the following three main categories: Amongst the various projects led by the LALIGA FOUNDATION, the following are of particular note: In October 2015, LALIGA decided to become actively involved in promoting and developing the female game and opened a women's football department to lead, along with the clubs, several strategies and initiatives targeted at enhancing and professionalising the competition, generating value, maximising visibility and promoting the international growth of its clubs and players. The LALIGA Business School, founded and run by LALIGA in conjunction with the Universidad Francisco de Vitoria, is a project that galvanizes LALIGA's commitment to education and which aims to train talent with a view to professionalising the sports industry. The school's five programmes, taught by LALIGA professionals, representatives from its member clubs and industry experts, are as follows: The school also offers various specialist courses, both in Spain and other countries throughout the world. In addition to its real-life football competition, in the 2017/18 season, LALIGA decided to enter the world of e-Sports. The 2019/20 edition of LALIGA FC PRO, the official EA SPORTS TM FIFA 20 Global Series competition in Spain, involved the participation of 34 LALIGA EA SPORTS and LALIGA HYPERMOTION clubs. LALIGA has also developed a number of apps and virtual games: LALIGA Grassroots is an initiative through which LALIGA brings together the organisation’s know-how, experience and youth football projects, doing so through the Sporting Projects department. It was launched in 2015 and is pioneering among the major European leagues, with a global network of academies and schools focused on developing international talent via the LALIGA methodology. Working with the Business and International Development department, LALIGA Grassroots runs different initiatives that provide a holistic development of young players, that offer international training programmes for industry professionals and that support LALIGA clubs with their academies and in organising international tournaments. All of this work culminated with the launch during the 2021/22 season of new LALIGA Grassroots programmes in Spain, thanks to integration with this new business unit and thanks to the construction of the state-of-the-art Centro ESC Madrid, a sporting complex that can host LALIGA’s most innovative programmes yet. LALIGA Entertainment is a joint venture between LALIGA, PortAventura World and Kosmos. This is a global entertainment company that exists in the videogame and theme parks industry. To begin with, there are two innovative assets: The Beat Challenge, an interactive videogame that uses augmented reality technology, and LALIGA TwentyNine’s PortAventura World, a revolutionary sportsbar concept that integrates with the videogame itself.

                "content": "Charles Alfred Morton IV[1] (born November 12, 1983) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles of Major League Baseball (MLB). He has played in MLB for the Atlanta Braves, Pittsburgh Pirates, Philadelphia Phillies, Houston Astros, and Tampa Bay Rays. The Braves selected Morton in the third round of the 2002 MLB draft and he made his MLB debut with them in 2008. Morton was a World Series champion in 2017 and 2021 and an All-Star in 2018 and 2019. Morton is the active pitcher with the most career batters hit by pitch with 180. Morton was born in Flemington, New Jersey, to Jeanne and Chip Morton, an accountant and former Penn State basketball player. His grandfather played in the Philadelphia Athletics farm system.[2] He was raised in Trumbull, Connecticut, playing little league baseball with future major leaguers pitcher Craig Breslow and infielder Jamie D'Antona.[3] Morton grew up attending ballgames at Yankee Stadium and idolizing Derek Jeter and Roger Clemens.[4] He attended Joel Barlow High School in Redding, Connecticut, graduating in 2002. The Atlanta Braves selected Morton in the third round with the 95th overall selection of the 2002 Major League Baseball draft. He started his professional career in 2002 with the GCL Braves, and was 1–7. In 2003, he played for the Danville Braves, and was 2–5. He spent the 2004 and 2005 seasons with the Rome Braves. In 2006, he pitched for the Myrtle Beach Pelicans, and was 6–7. In 2007, he pitched for the Mississippi Braves, and was 4–6.[5] The Braves added Morton to their 40-man roster on November 20, 2007.[6] Morton made his major league debut on June 14, 2008, against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, allowing three runs in six innings and earning his first major league win.[7][8] In 2008 he was 4–8 with a 6.15 ERA.[5] On June 3, 2009, the Braves traded Morton with Gorkys Hernández and Jeff Locke to the Pittsburgh Pirates in exchange for Nate McLouth.[9] He made his first start with the Pirates on June 10 pitching an inning against the Atlanta Braves, while Jeff Karstens got the win. On June 28, he received his first decision, a loss to the Kansas City Royals. On July 3, 2009, he won his first game pitching 6 innings of 1 hit baseball against the Florida Marlins. On September 30, 2009, he pitched a complete game 4 hitter with 8 strikeouts against the Chicago Cubs. His 2009 record in 18 starts was 5 wins and 9 losses, a 4.55 ERA, 97 innings pitched and 62 strikeouts, 40 walks, 7 home runs, 5 hit batsmen, .276 average against, and a 1.46 WHIP.[5] Morton began 2010 spring training as a member of the Pirates' starting rotation. He struggled losing all five starts in April and finishing the month with a 12.57 earned run average (ERA). However, Morton delivered a promising performance on April 30, 2010, against the Los Angeles Dodgers, striking out 8 in six innings of work while allowing six runs (only three earned). In that game, he was dealt a loss as the Pirates only provided him with two runs of support. He earned his first win of the season on May 5 against the Chicago Cubs striking out three in a 4–2 decision. However, he lost each of his next four starts, dropping his record on the season to 1–9 with a 9.35 ERA. A day after suffering his 9th loss against the Cincinnati Reds, the Pirates placed him on the 15-day disabled list with shoulder fatigue. After recovering, he was assigned to the Pirates Triple-A affiliate Indianapolis Indians. Speaking before his first start with the Indians, Morton said \"I was pressing. I wasn't being myself on the mound those last couple of times I went out there in Pittsburgh. There was so much going on in my mind. At the end of last year, I finished strong, I got a glimpse of what I could do, truly, in the big leagues, going out there and going deep into games, being competitive, and being someone who was pretty good. I wanted to be out there for myself and because I care about this team and organization. At the same time, though, after that last one, that last start, because I care about these guys is why, exactly, I knew I couldn't go back out there again.\"[10] Morton was recalled when starter Ross Ohlendorf was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to a shoulder injury. On his final start of the 2010 season, Morton compiled his finest pitching performance of the year striking out a career-high nine batters in a 2–0 loss to the Florida Marlins on October 2. He finished the season with a 2–12 record and a 7.57 ERA, but in his final six starts of the season after being recalled in late August he sported a 4.26 ERA. 2011 was Morton's best season yet, where he held a 10–10 record in 29 starts with a 3.83 ERA, earning the club's Breakout Player of the Year.[11] On April 15, Morton threw a complete game against the Cincinnati Reds. On May 18, again at Great American Ball Park, Morton threw a complete game shutout, striking out 5 and giving up 5 hits.[12] Following the season, Morton underwent successful hip surgery to repair a torn labrum in October 2011 with a full recovery expected in 4–6 months. He was optimistic about returning before Opening Day.[13] However, he began the 2012 season on the disabled list, making his season debut on April 14. His season ended when he underwent Tommy John surgery on June 14, 2012.[14] On June 13, 2013, Morton was activated off the DL. He picked up his first win of the season on June 18 in a shutout against the Cincinnati Reds. He pitched 5+1⁄3 innings giving up only 3 hits and no runs, while striking out 2. On July 22 and 27, he won back-to-back games for the first time since May 7 and 18, 2011. On December 11, 2013, Morton signed a three-year contract to remain with the Pirates, with a club option for the 2017 season.[15] Morton was placed on the DL with right hip inflammation on August 17, 2014. At the time, he was 5–12 with a 3.84 ERA.[16] During September, Morton needed hip surgery, effectively ending his 2014 season. In 26 starts in 2014, Morton hit 19 batsmen with pitches, which led the Majors along with a 6–12 record and a 3.72 ERA. During the 2015 spring training, Morton struggled thoroughly and began to experience inflammation in his recently surgically repaired hip. On April 5, 2015, the Pirates placed Morton on the 15-day disabled list. On December 12, 2015, the Pirates traded Morton to the Philadelphia Phillies in exchange for David Whitehead.[17] His season came to an abrupt end on April 23, 2016, when Morton suffered a hamstring injury running to first base in a game against the Milwaukee Brewers and was placed on the disabled list the next day.[18] On April 27, the Phillies announced Morton would miss the rest of the 2016 season with a torn hamstring.[19] On November 16, 2016, Morton signed a two-year, $14 million contract with the Houston Astros.[20] During the 2017 regular season, Morton made 25 starts, compiling a 14–7 record with a 3.62 ERA. He pitched 146+2⁄3 innings and recorded 163 strikeouts. Morton started Game 3 of the American League Championship Series (ALCS) at Yankee Stadium. He lost the game, giving up 7 runs in 3+2⁄3 innings.[21] On October 21, he won Game 7 of the ALCS at Minute Maid Park, pitching five shutout innings with five strikeouts, sending the Astros to the World Series.[22] Morton started Game 4 of the World Series and pitched well over 6.1 innings giving up one earned run on 3 hits and 7 strikeouts in an eventual Astros loss. Morton pitched the final four innings in Game 7 of the World Series. He was credited as the winning pitcher helping the Astros win their first World Series title.[23] Three years later, it was revealed in the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal that the team had broken MLB rules during the 2017 season. Morton admitted he knew about the team's cheating and expressed regret that he did not do anything to stop it.[24] In 2018, Morton continued his successful stint with the Astros. On May 12, he set a personal record of 14 strikeouts over seven innings in a 6–1 victory against the Texas Rangers.[25] Entering the All-Star break third in the American League with 11 wins, 11.7 strikeouts per nine innings, and ninth in ERA (2.96), Morton was added to the AL roster for the 2018 MLB All-Star Game.[26] Morton avoided serious injury in 2018, with only a short trip to the 10-day DL for shoulder discomfort. He pitched 167 innings, second only to his 2011 high of 171.2. Morton finished the regular season with a 3.13 ERA, a 15–3 win–loss record, and 201 strikeouts, all constituting career highs.[27] On December 21, 2018, the Tampa Bay Rays signed Morton to a two-year, $30 million contract.[28] He made his debut as a Ray against the Astros on March 29, 2019, pitching five innings and earning the win. On June 30, he was awarded his second consecutive All-Star appearance.[29] In 2019, he led all major league pitchers in home runs/9 innings pitched, at 0.694.[30] He set career highs in wins (16), ERA (3.05), innings (194+2⁄3) and strikeouts (240). He finished in third place for the Cy Young Award.[31] Morton started the American League Wild Card Game against the Oakland Athletics, receiving a win in five innings of work.[32] This was Morton's third career win in winner-take-all playoff games, the most in MLB playoff history.[32] On August 10, 2020, Morton was placed on the injured list with inflammation in his right shoulder.[33] Morton finished the 2020 year with an ERA of 4.74 over 38 innings.[34] Morton pitched in game 7 of the American League Championship Series against his former team the Houston Astros. He recorded his fourth win in a winner-take-all playoff game, extending his record.[35] On October 30, 2020, the Rays declined their $15 million team option on his contract for the 2021 season, and he was declared a free agent. At the time the Rays made their decision, it was reported that they were looking for a \"creative\" way to re-sign Morton as a free agent for the following year.[36] On November 24, 2020, the Atlanta Braves signed Morton to a one-year, $15 million contract.[37][38] On September 6, 2021, Morton and the Braves agreed to a one-year extension worth $20 million.[39][40] In the 2021 regular season, he was 14–6 with a 3.34 ERA in 33 starts.[41] On October 26, 2021, during Game 1 of the World Series versus the Houston Astros, Morton left the game after pitching only 2+1⁄3 innings with what was revealed to be a right fibula fracture. The injury occurred in the previous inning when Astros batter Yuli Gurriel hit a ball directly into Morton's leg. Initially believing he was unharmed, Morton continued to pitch, completing 16 more pitches—including a strikeout of former MVP Jose Altuve—before removing himself from the game.[42][43][44] Morton did not play for the remainder of the series. The Braves later won the World Series, giving the Braves their first title since 1995 and Morton his second World Series ring.[45] On September 30, 2022, Morton and the Braves agreed to a one-year contract extension for the 2023 season worth $20 million.[46][47] Morton recorded at least 200 strikeouts in consecutive seasons with the team, and became the third Atlanta Braves pitcher to have struck out 200 or more batters in multiple seasons.[48] In 2022, he was 9–6 with a 4.34 ERA, as in 31 starts he pitched 172 innings, and threw curveballs 38% of the time, more than any other pitcher in major league baseball.[49][50] The active career leader in hit batsmen with 156, he hit 18 batters, second in the NL.[49] During the 2023 season, Morton pitched to a 3.64 ERA and a 14–12 record.[51] The Braves picked up the option year on his contract, worth $20 million.[52] On June 28, 2024, Morton became the 22nd pitcher in MLB history to record a win against all 30 teams, following a scoreless outing against the Pittsburgh Pirates.[53] On August 13, 2024, Morton became the 89th pitcher in MLB history to reach the 2,000 strikeout mark when he struck out Mike Yastrzemski in the bottom of the sixth inning against the San Francisco Giants.[54] In 2024, Morton pitched to a 4.01 ERA and a 8-10 record with 167 strikeouts. On January 3, 2025, Morton signed a one-year, $15 million contract with the Baltimore Orioles.[55] Morton's repertoire consisted in 2013 of a four-seam fastball, a sinker, a curveball, and a split-finger fastball with his speed maxing out in the low 90s.[56] Morton picked up the splitter in 2011 having previously thrown a changeup. He also has previously thrown a slider and a cutter.[57] Morton's sinker was his most common pitch, especially against right-handed hitters. His curveball was his most common pitch in a two strike count.[58] Due to changes in his delivery and the emphasis he has placed on the sinker, Morton drew comparisons to Roy Halladay.[59] Pirates special assistant Jim Benedict had previously encouraged Morton to emulate Halladay's delivery during spring training. Morton featured his new sinker almost exclusively in his first starts of the 2011 season and it resulted in an increased groundball rate but also more bases on balls. Pirates' fans christened him with the nickname \"Ground Chuck.\"[60][61][62] In the 2015 offseason, a frustrated Morton began experimenting with throwing harder, alongside adjustments to his technique and workouts.[63] In his injury-abbreviated starts with the Phillies, he showcased his newfound velocity. Along with high spin rates, this attracted the attention of Houston's front office which signed him and encouraged Morton to continue throwing hard four-seam fastballs, as Morton felt his sinker was becoming ineffective.[64] While playing for the Astros, Morton transformed into a strikeout pitcher finding new effectiveness against left-handed hitters.[65] With Houston his primary pitches were a four-seam fastball reaching 98-99 MPH and a curveball with considerable vertical and horizontal movement, which Morton considers his best pitch.[66] In 2018, his improvements on his curveball was attributed to his low three-quarters position, but slightly above sidearm at release.[67] Morton and his wife, Cindy, have four children.[68] They reside in Bradenton, Florida.[69]",

With no time to waste in 2025, the first celestial show of the year gets underway this week with the Quadrantid meteor shower peak. NASA said the Quadrantid meteor shower is unique because of its brief peak and the origin of the shooting stars. Most meteor showers originate from comet debris, but the Quadrantids come from an asteroid.

(Photo by Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu via Getty Images) (Getty Images) The Quadrantids peak each year in early January as the Earth passes through the debris trail from asteroid 2003 EH1. Astronomers say this asteroid could be a new object known as a \"dead comet\" or \"rock comet.\" DON'T MISS THESE CELESTIAL EVENTS IN 2025 Although the Quadrantids have been observed in the night sky since the early 1800s, their origin was only discovered in 2003.

(Photo by Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu via Getty Images) Also, unlike other annual meteor showers, which peak over several days, the Quadrantids are a quick skygazing show. The peak lasts just six hours. According to NASA, this brief encounter is because the Earth crosses the thin stream of particles at a perpendicular angle. According to the American Meteor Society (AMS), this year's peak happens Friday, with the best chance of seeing meteors early Friday morning. During the peak, as many as 200 meteors can be seen under perfect weather and viewing conditions. The timing of this year's Quadrantid meteor shower peaks between 15:00 and 18:00 UTC (10 a.m. and 1 p.m. EST), which favors those in Hawaii and Alaska, according to AMS Editor Robert Lunsford. The cloud cover forecast for Friday morning. (FOX Weather) While early January doesn't offer the best weather for stargazing, the peak this year happens a few days after a new Moon with only 11% illumination. This means less moonlight to compete with the meteor shower. Unfortunately, cloud cover will cover many parts of the U.S. with active winter weather happening. According to the AMS, the Quadrantids continue through mid-January, when an average of 25 meteors per hour are possible under good conditions.

                "content": "A daily update by email. Science news, great photos, sky alerts. The Quadrantid meteor shower is one of a few each year with a narrow peak, in this case lasting only about 6 hours. When to watch: The best time to watch for the 2025 Quadrantids is the hours before dawn on January 3. (The predicted peak** is 19 UTC on January 3). Nearest moon phase: A first quarter moon will come at 23:56 UTC on January 6, 2025 (5:56 p.m. CST) so the moon will be a waxing crescent and set a few hours after sunset on January 2 and not interfere with the Quadrantid meteors. Radiant: Rises in the north-northeast after midnight and is highest up before dawn. The radiant point for the Quadrantids is in a now-obsolete constellation, Quadrans Muralis the Mural Quadrant. Nowadays, we see the radiant near the famous Big Dipper asterism. Because the Quadrantid radiant is far to the north on the sky’s dome, this is mostly a far-northern shower, not as good for the Southern Hemisphere. Expected meteors at peak, under ideal conditions: Under a dark sky with no moon, when the radiant is high in the sky, the Quadrantids can (briefly) produce over 100 meteors per hour. Duration of shower: The Quadrantid meteor shower runs from mid-November through mid-January each year, according to this 2017 article in the journal Icarus. You might see a Quadrantid streak by any time during that interval. But most activity is centered on the peak. This time period is when we’re passing through the meteor stream in space! Note: The Quadrantid shower is one of four major meteor showers each year with a sharp peak (the other three are the Lyrids, Leonids and Ursids). Report a fireball (very bright meteor) to the American Meteor Society: it’s fun and easy! From the late, great Don Machholz (1952-2022), who discovered 12 comets … For many years, the parent comet for the Quadrantids remained unknown. That’s because astronomers were looking for an object whose orbit matched the orbit of the Quadrantids’ meteor stream. Other meteor showers do have parent objects whose orbits match their meteor streams. But the Quadrantids’ parent object – or objects – are different. There are currently at least two related objects associated with Quadrantid meteors. Neither presently comes anywhere near Earth’s orbit. But both seem to be responsible for these early January meteors. The chief object that spawns the Quadrantids is an asteroid named 2003 EH1. It’s believed to be a dormant or extinct comet. The Lowell Observatory Near-Earth-Object Search (LONEOS) based near Flagstaff, Arizona, found asteroid 2003 EH1 on March 6, 2003. The asteroid takes 5.5 years to orbit the sun. Its closest point to the sun (perihelion) is 1.2 astronomical units (AU). One AU is the distance between the Earth and the sun. In past centuries, 2003 EH1 must have passed much closer to the Earth’s orbit. Now, though, this asteroid stays well outside Earth’s orbit. Yet particles ejected from this asteroid do intersect Earth’s orbit, to produce the Quadrantids’ narrow peak. And astronomers now say there is also a second, related object that also contributes to this meteor shower. The second object – Comet 96P/Machholz – produces a less intense and shallower peak. The material we see streaking across the sky left this comet centuries ago. Its perihelion distance is 0.12 AU, and it orbits the sun every 5.3 years. It was back near the Earth in late January 2023. 2025 EarthSky lunar calendar is available now. A unique and beautiful poster-sized calendar with phases of the moon for every night of the year. Get yours today! What’s the story on these two parent objects for the Quadrantids? The latest theory is that a large comet was captured by our sun and settled into a short-period orbit in about 2,000 BCE. This comet supplied meteors to the inner solar system and then it broke apart sometime between 100 CE and 950 CE. This breakup produced the Machholz Complex. In other words, there are multiple resultant offspring of this great comet. They are Comet 96P/Machholz, the Marsden Comet Group, the Kracht Comet Group, asteroid 2003 EH1 and eight meteor showers. The group is named the Machholz Complex after the main object, 96P/Machholz. A comet that was seen more than 500 years ago, C/1490 Y1, might be involved, too. The orbit calculated for this comet comes from rough positions calculated for the comet’s predicted return, which should be every few years. But we have not seen this comet again. One study suggests it approached too close to the planet Jupiter. So it might have been thrown out of the solar system. That might be why we haven’t seen it since 1490. Or, the comet might have split up prior to its next return, producing the Machholz Complex. This is not the final word about the parent objects of the Quadrantid meteor shower. Research continues among orbit calculators to better understand the transition of material from the surface of these objects to our Earth’s atmosphere every January. A new paper comes out nearly every year on the subject. That is how science works. Regardless of their origins, the Quadrantid meteor shower is a fine way to start a new year. The radiant point of the Quadrantid shower makes an approximate right angle with the Big Dipper and the bright star Arcturus. If you trace the paths of the Quadrantid meteors backward, they appear to radiate from this point on the starry sky. See chart at the top of this page. Now for our usual caveat. You don’t need to find the meteor shower radiant to see the Quadrantid meteors. You need to be at mid-northern or far-northern latitudes, up in the wee hours of the morning, and hope the peak comes at just the right time to your part of the world. The meteors will radiate from the northern sky but appear in all parts of the sky. Most meteor showers get their name from the constellations from which they appear to radiate. So it is with the Quadrantids. But the Quadrantids’ constellation no longer exists, except in memory. The name Quadrantid comes from the constellation Quadrans Muralis (Mural Quadrant). French astronomer Jerome Lalande created this constellation in 1795. This now-obsolete constellation was between the constellations of Boötes the Herdsman and Draco the Dragon. What happened to it? Where’d it go? To understand the history of the Quadrantids’ name, we go back to the earliest observations of this meteor shower. In early January 1825, Antonio Brucalassi in Italy reported that: … the atmosphere was traversed by a multitude of the luminous bodies known by the name of falling stars. They appeared to radiate from Quadrans Muralis. In 1839, two men, Adolphe Quetelet of Brussels Observatory in Belgium and Edward C. Herrick in Connecticut, independently suggested the Quadrantids as an annual shower. Then, in 1922, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) created a list of the 88 modern constellations. And it did not include Quadrans Muralis. Hardly anyone would remember this old constellation, if not for the Quadrantid meteor shower. The Quadrantids favor the Northern Hemisphere because their radiant is so far north on the sky’s dome. If you’re in the Southern Hemisphere, you might be tempted to resign yourself to the months-long meteor drought that kicks off every year and ends in April with the Lyrids. But, once in a while, we do hear from Southern Hemisphere dwellers who’ve seen a few Quadrantids! Bottom line: The best time to watch the Quadrantid meteor shower in 2025 is the hours before dawn on January 3, in a moon-free sky. This shower has a narrow peak, lasting only hours. **Peak times for meteor showers provided by Robert Lunsford of the American Meteor Society. Note that meteor shower predicted peaks may vary.

                "content": "The first meteor shower of the New Year also has the potential to be one of the year's best – if the weather cooperates. But astronomers lament that the Quadrantid meteors tend to fall short of expectations due to the comparatively short length of their maximum activity and the obscuring wintry conditions of early January. That doesn't mean the cosmic display – one of the few meteor showers to be caused by debris from an asteroid instead of a comet – isn't worth seeking out. Stargazers could be treated to a host of bright fireballs and the sight of multiple meteors per hour whizzing across the night sky at more than 25 miles per second when the Quadrantids reach their peak. Here's what to know about the Quadrantid meteor shower, including when it peaks and what causes it. Meteor showers occur on a predictable schedule each year, with some lasting for mere days and others stretching on for weeks. A meteor shower is at its best when the Earth passes through the densest part of the associated cosmic debris. That window, otherwise known as the shower's peak activity, is when stargazers will want to be on the lookout for meteors. The Quadrantids began zipping through the skies on Dec. 26 and will continue through Jan. 16, according to the American Meteor Society. But while most meteor showers have a two-day peak, the Quadrantids' maximum activity only lasts a few hours – making the meteors much more difficult to spot, according to NASA. For stargazers, that means the best time to catch the Quadrantid meteors will be in the predawn hours Thursday night into Friday morning, astronomers say. Timeanddate.com offers a detailed schedule for when to see the Quadrantids. The Quadrantids are best viewed from the Northern Hemisphere and are not well seen from the Southern Hemisphere. During its peak, anywhere from 60 to 200 Quadrantid meteors can be seen per hour under ideal conditions, according to NASA. While the meteors are known to lack persistent tails, they often produce bright fireballs, which are larger explosions of light persisting longer than an average meteor streak. The meteors seem to emerge – or radiate – from an obsolete constellation called \"Quadrans Muralis\" that today is located between the constellations of Bootes and Draco near the end of the handle of the Big Dipper, NASA says. Both the constellation and the shower are named after the quadrant, an early astronomical instrument used to observe and plot star positions. Astronomers caution that the radiant is not a good guide for where stargazers should look to view the streaking meteors, which should be visible across the night sky. Here are some general viewing tips from NASA: ◾ Find an area well away from street lights and the light pollution of cities. ◾ Come prepared for winter temperatures with a sleeping bag, blanket, or lawn chair. ◾ Lie flat on your back with your feet facing northeast and look up, taking in as much of the sky as possible. It should take less than 30 minutes for your eyes to adapt so that you can see streaking meteors. Meteor showers occur when Earth passes through dusty debris trails left by comets and other space objects as they orbit the sun. The debris – space rocks known as meteoroids – collides with Earth's atmosphere at high speed and disintegrates, creating fiery and colorful streaks in the sky, according to NASA. Those resulting fireballs, better known as \"shooting stars,\" are meteors. If meteoroids survive their trip to Earth without burning up in the atmosphere, they are called meteorites, NASA says. Unlike most meteor showers, the Quadrantid meteor shower doesn't originate from a comet, but from an asteroid. For many years, the origin of the Quadrantids remained unknown. Though the Quadrantids were first seen in 1825, it wasn't until 2003 that an astronomer at Lowell Observatory in Arizona discovered a small asteroid, 2003 EH1, was the source of the shower. Astronomers theorize that 2003 EH1, which takes about 5 ½ years to orbit the sun, is a dead comet that is now essentially a rock. Eric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

The Quadrantid meteor shower is active from late December 2024 to early January 2025. It will peak on 3–4 January. Read on for tips on how to catch the best view of this stunning shower from planetary scientist and meteorite expert Dr Ashley King. Meteors are often called shooting stars, though the bright streaks you see in the sky don’t have anything to do with stars. In fact, what you’re wishing on are tiny particles of dust – leftovers from the birth of our solar system – vaporising in Earth’s atmosphere. Some of the more spectacular of these meteors can sometimes be visible from city centres, including in London, however you’re bound to get the best experience away from the light pollution in urban areas. A bright meteor recorded on a meteor-monitoring CCTV camera at the Natural History Museum. “The darker the skies, the better your chances of seeing the really faint meteors as well,” says Ashley. “You could go to the coast or stand on a hill in the middle of the countryside somewhere.” A full Moon can really light up the sky too, so you’ll likely have more success spotting meteors when a shower’s peak coincides with a new Moon. Fortunately, in 2025, several showers are set to occur when the skies are at their darkest. You also need to be patient. “You might not be able to see anything for the first 10 minutes while your eyes adjust to the dark,” he adds. “Once you get used to the low light levels you’ll begin to notice more and more. So don’t give up too quickly.” Meteor showers occur when Earth passes through streams of tiny pieces of debris – meteoroids – left behind by comets and asteroids. The peak of a meteor shower is when we see the highest rate of meteors. This happens as we pass through the densest part of the debris stream. Most comets are composed of dust and ice, which Ashley likens to “a big, dirty snowball”. “As comets orbit the Sun, the ice sublimes [changes from a solid to a gas] and the trapped dust is swept out into a tail behind them.” Nearly all meteors are tiny dust particles, about the size of a grain of sand travelling at tens of kilometres per second through space. “As they come out of the vacuum of space and into Earth’s atmosphere, that little dust grain interacts with all the particles and ions in the atmosphere. It gets heated up by the friction and forms the impressive flash that we see,” he says. “The Earth isn’t close to the comet – it’s just passing through some of the dust it left behind.” At other times of year, you may still see meteors in the sky, but only about one every 10 minutes. These sporadic meteors, as they are known, will come from random directions. A lone meteor. © Jacek Halick (CC BY-SA 4.0) via Wikimedia commons The Quadrantid meteor shower begins on 28 December 2024 and ends on 12 January 2025, and is best viewed from the Northern Hemisphere. It’s thought to occur when Earth passes through the trail left by the asteroid 2003 EH1. The Quadrantid meteor shower has a much shorter peak than others, lasting for just six hours before its intensity rapidly drops off. In 2025, the peak will occur on 3–4 January, just a few days after a new Moon. At its peak, and in ideal viewing conditions, up to 120 meteors and bright fireballs can be seen per hour, with the particles entering Earth’s atmosphere at around 40 kilometres per second. The Quadrantids appear to radiate from an area near the Big Dipper between the constellations of Boötes and Draco. This area was previously recognised as a separate constellation, which was named Quadrans Muralis by French astronomer Jerome Lalande in 1795. In 1922, the decision was made to no longer recognise Quadrans Muralis as an official constellation, but the meteor shower still continues to be named after it. In March 2003, a small near-Earth asteroid was discovered and named as 2003 EH1. This body completes an orbit of the Sun once every 5.5 years and is thought to be the source of the Quadrantid meteor shower. Some think that 2003 EH1 might be an extinct comet. This is a comet that has expelled most of its ice and so appears more like an asteroid, as it no longer has enough material to form a tail or coma – the ice and dust envelope that forms around a comet’s solid centre. People watching a meteor shower. © Allexxandar/ Shutterstock The Lyrid meteor shower takes place between 14–30 April as the Earth’s orbit passes through the dust trail left behind, hundreds of years ago, by comet C/186 G1 (Thatcher). This year, at the peak of the display on 22 April, around 18 meteors per hour are expected to be visible. The most spectacular are ‘Lyrid fireballs’, which occur when meteoroids the size of a large marble pass through the atmosphere. Their slightly larger size produces a meteor train which we see as a flash and line across the night sky. This year, the peak of the Lyrids falls during the Moon’s last quarter, making viewing conditions much better than in 2024, when it coincided with a full Moon. The Lyrid meteor shower gets its name because it appears to radiate from the area of the sky near the constellation Lyra, the Harp – but the meteors can appear anywhere in the sky. Comet Thatcher, responsible for the Lyrid meteor shower, takes 415 years to complete a full orbit of the Sun. We have no photographs of this comet because the last time it visited the inner solar system was in 1861 – well before the widespread use of photography. We won’t see it again until the year 2283.

Most meteors are pieces of dust around the size of a grain of sand. Larger pieces can create spectacular fireballs and make bright trails across the sky. The Perseid shower may feature more than 100 meteors per hour at its peak, including bright streaks and fireballs. The best views will be from a dark location on the night of 12 August. This meteor shower is usually one of the best celestial events of the year to watch. Unfortunately, viewing conditions for the Perseids won’t be ideal this year, with the peak falling just three days after a full Moon. Perseids get their name because they appear to radiate from the constellation Perseus, but they can appear anywhere in the sky. Swift-Tuttle, responsible for the Perseid meteor shower, takes 133 years to complete a full orbit of the Sun. At 26 kilometres wide it is the largest solar system object to regularly pass so close to Earth. It’s likely significantly bigger than the asteroid that ended the age of dinosaurs, but don’t worry, calculations have shown that Swift-Tuttle isn’t a threat to the planet. Swift-Tuttle’s elongated orbit means that debris enters Earth’s atmosphere at great speed. The Perseid meteor shower in 2015. © John Fowler via Flickr (CC BY 2.0) The Orionid meteor shower takes place from 2 October to 7 November as Earth passes through the trail of Halley’s Comet, one of the most famous comets of all time. In 2025, the shower is due to peak on the night of 21–22 October. This year the peak falls on a moonless night, giving you ideal dark sky conditions for spotting meteors. Orionids are some of the fastest and brightest meteors, entering the atmosphere at just under 70 kilometres per second. Orionids get their name because they seem to radiate from the constellation Orion, but they can appear anywhere in the sky. Stargazers can usually expect to see up to 20 meteors per hour. Halley’s Comet is a short-period comet, meaning it takes less than 200 years to go around the Sun. Its orbital period is 75–76 years and it last passed close to Earth in 1986. It will be back again in 2061. In 1986, space agencies sent the missions Vega, Giotto, Sakigake and Suisei to Halley – known as the ‘Halley Armada’ – so it’s one of the best-studied comets. Halley’s Comet has been observed for centuries – in 1066 it was considered an omen of doom. It even appears on the Bayeux Tapestry, which depicts events leading up to the Norman conquest of England in the eleventh century. Orionid meteor shower and the Milky Way. © Brian Spencer/ Shutterstock The Leonid meteor shower takes place annually between 6–30 November as Earth crosses the trail of comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle. Entering the atmosphere at 70 kilometres per second, the Leonids are some of the fastest-moving and brightest meteors. The shower promises up to 15 meteors per hour at its peak on the evening of 17 November, which is just a few days before a new Moon. Leonids get their name because they seem to radiate from the constellation Leo. Comet Tempel-Tuttle is a short-period comet, taking 33 years to go around the Sun. Its last visit was in 1998 with a return expected in 2031. The comet is quite small, only about three kilometres across. The comet is named for the two astronomers, Ernst Tempel and Horace Tuttle, who each independently discovered it in 1865 and 1866, respectively. Horace Tuttle also co-discovered Comet Swift-Tuttle, which causes the Perseid meteor shower. One of the most spectacular meteor showers of the year, the Geminids take place from 4–20 December as Earth passes through the trail of dust left by the ‘rock comet’ 3200 Phaethon. At the shower’s peak on the morning of 14 December, stargazers willing to brave the cold could be rewarded with a display of up to 150 multicoloured meteors per hour. It’s often one of the best showers of the year for viewers in the northern hemisphere, as it’s one of the most active. This year it falls just a few days before a new Moon. Geminids get their name because meteors appear to radiate from the constellation Gemini. Discovered by satellite in 1983, Phaethon has an orbital period of 524 days and is one of only a few asteroids associated with a meteor shower. According to Ashley, there’s been quite a lot of debate about what Phaethon really is. “Like other comets, Phaethon has an elliptical orbit but is unusual as it doesn’t go to the outer solar system. It has been officially classified as a B-type asteroid, but it has also been suggested that it could be a ‘rock comet’ or a ‘dead comet’.” Scientists have been studying Phaethon’s infrared emissions to learn more about this mysterious space rock. In 2023, this research revealed that Phaethon is likely linked to the CY group of carbonaceous chondrites. Carbonaceous chondrites are some of the oldest rocks in the solar system. They are often rich in water, sulphur and organic material, but those in the CY group show signs of drying and decomposition caused by heating. Phaethon travels even closer to the Sun than Mercury does. Scientists at the Natural History Museum have helped estimate that, at perihelion – the asteroid’s closest point to the Sun – its surface reaches 730 °C and some of its components turn to gas. The pressure this gas creates causes the rock to break down, leaving a comet-like trail of dust behind the asteroid as it travels through space. Phaethon may once have been similar to the asteroid Ryugu, from which the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Hayabusa2 mission returned samples in December 2020, and Bennu, an asteroid visited by NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission, which returned to Earth with samples in September 2023. Our scientists have been leading some of the first analyses of the Bennu samples. Phaethon is considered a potentially hazardous asteroid, meaning it could impact the Earth at some point hundreds of years in the future. For this reason, it’s very well studied and there are plans to send space missions there in the future, such as DESTINY+, which aims to launch in 2028.

Anyone can capture the majesty of the galaxy with a simple camera. All you need is a dark, clear night and the willingness to have a go. When an unusual rock fell to Earth in 1795, it prompted the first large-scale investigation into the origin of meteorites. Falling from the sky in a blaze of glory, meteorites certainly know how to make an entrance, and the stories they tell span the history of our solar system.

                "title": "Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team is an NCAA Division I college basketball team competing in the Big Ten Conference, that represent the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Home games are played at the State Farm Center, located on the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign's campus in Champaign. Illinois has one pre-tournament national championship and one non-NCAA tournament national championship in 1915 and 1943, awarded by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. Illinois has appeared in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament 34 times, and has competed in 5 Final Fours, 10 Elite Eights, and has won 18 Big Ten regular season championships, and 4 Big Ten Tournament Championships. The team is currently coached by Brad Underwood, who was hired on March 18, 2017. Through the end of the 2023–24 season, Illinois ranks 13th all-time in winning percentage and 13th all-time in wins among all NCAA Division I men's college basketball programs. The Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team began play during the 1905–06 season with Elwood Brown guiding the team to a 9–8 record as their first coach. Frank L. Pinckney took control of the team before the start of the 1906–07 season. The team would win their first game but would end up dropping the next 10 contests. Another coaching change led to Fletcher Lane being in charge of the team for the 1907–08 season. After starting the season 14–1 in non-conference, Illinois would finish the season losing five of their 11 conference games, ending the year third in the Western Conference with a 20–6 (6–5) record. Even though Lane led a successful season, his style of coaching was deemed subpar. Former Illini player Herb Juul was then hired as the head coach of the 1908–09 squad. The Illini would not see the same success as the season prior, finishing the season with a 7–6 (5–6) record. Despite the struggles, Juul became the first coach in Illinois history to return for more than one season. However, the 1909–10 season would be his last as the Illini finished with a 5–4 (5–4) record. Thomas E. Thompson took the reigns before the 1910–11 season. The Illini would finish fourth in the Western Conference after earning a 6–6 (6–5) record. The 1911–12 season was Thompson's last year as head coach of the Illini after they finished with an 8–8 (4–8) record. Before the start of the 1912–13 season, Illinois hired former Purdue head coach, Ralph Jones. During his three seasons in West Lafayette, Jones compiled a 32–9 record, while also winning the previous two Western Conference titles. During his first season with Illinois, Jones led the Illini to a 10–6 record which was Illinois' second 10-win season in school history. During the 1914–15 season, Illinois won their first-ever Big Ten title, going 16–0 (12–0). They were retroactively declared champion of that season by the Helms Athletic Foundation and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. They would earn another Big Ten title during the 1916–17 season, sharing it with Minnesota. Before the start of the 1936–37 season, Douglas R. Mills began acting as the head coach and athletic director of the Illinois men's basketball team. In his first season, the Illini finished with a 14–4 (10–2) record, which was good enough to share the Big Ten title with Minnesota. Before World War II broke out, the Fighting Illini men's basketball program had achieved a status that had never been seen prior. Mills grouped a team of players, all around 6-foot-3, into a nearly undefeatable lineup later known as the \"Whiz Kids\". The 1941–42 freshman and sophomore lineup of Arthur Smiley, Ken Menke, Andy Phillip, Gene Vance, Victor Wukovits, and Art Mathisen dominated the Big Ten by posting a 13–2 conference record and winning the conference title outright. It would be their first unanimous Big Ten championship since 1915. The Illini finished 1942–43 season with a 17–1 (12–0) record, winning their second-straight Big Ten title. Despite being ranked No. 1 in the nation, they opted not to play in the 1943 NCAA tournament after three of their five starters were called to duty in World War II. At the end of the season, they were named Premo-Porretto Pre-Associated Press Poll national champions. The 1946–47 season, would be Mills' last season as the head coach of the Illini. The team ended the season with a 14–6 (8–4) record, finishing one game behind Wisconsin in the Big Ten standings. Under Mills, the Illini compiled a record of 151 wins and 66 losses while winning three conference championships in the process. Champaign High School basketball coach Harry Combes was hired to succeed Doug Mills as Mills left the position to focus on his duties as the athletic director. Through his first five seasons as head coach, Combes led the Fighting Illini to three NCAA Final Four appearances in 1949, 1951, and 1952.[2] During his tenure as coach, Combes increased the Fighting Illini's offensive output by changing their style of play. Combes implemented Full-court press defense, causing turnovers at a high rate which translated into Fast break points.[2] In 1951, Combes signed the first black player to don an Illinois uniform, 3x All-State point guard Walt Moore of Mount Vernon. Along with teammate and future Illinois standout Max Hooper, Moore led the Rams to back-to-back state championship titles, culminating with a perfect 33–0 record in 1950. During the 1957–58 season, Mannie Jackson and Govoner Vaughn were inserted into the starting lineup as the first two African-Americans to start and letter in basketball at Illinois.[3] Combes also oversaw the Illini's move from Huff Hall to Assembly Hall in 1963 and during that same season the Illini won a fourth Big Ten Conference championship under Combes. However, the Illini lost to eventual national champion Loyola (Chicago) in the Elite Eight of the 1963 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. The following 1964–65 season, saw several upset victories over defending national champion UCLA Bruins and national powerhouse Kentucky Wildcats at Memorial Coliseum in Lexington, Kentucky.[2] Combes' tenure came to an end as a result of the University of Illinois slush fund scandal. As head coach of the basketball team, he was primarily responsible for the basketball fund, and thus held a key role in the scandal. Assistant basketball coach Howie Braun also lost his job due to the scandal. Former Illini player Harv Schmidt was hired to fill the head coaching vacancy ten days after Combes' forced resignation. During his tenure, the Illini compiled an 89-77 overall record but went 43-55 in conference play. The team did not have any postseason appearances during his tenure. Gene Bartow would later sign a five-year contract to replace Schmidt in 1974, but he left after one season in which the Illini finished last place in the conference to replace John Wooden at UCLA. In 1975, after having taken New Mexico State (and future Illinois assistant coach Jimmy Collins) to the 1970 Final Four, Lou Henson moved to the University of Illinois to replace Gene Bartow, after Bartow left Illinois to replace the legendary John Wooden at UCLA. Henson would lead the Fighting Illini back to their glory after having a number of difficult years following the Illinois slush fund scandal (where Illinois was hit with severe penalties for infractions that other Big 10 schools had in years prior been punished much more leniently (according to Sports Illustrated) at the time). In 21 years at Illinois, Henson garnered 423 wins and 224 losses (.654 winning percentage), and with a record of 214 wins and 164 losses (.567) in Big Ten Conference games. The 214 wins in Big Ten games were the third highest total ever at the time of his retirement. At Illinois, Henson coached many future NBA players, including Eddie Johnson, Derek Harper, Ken Norman, Nick Anderson, Kendall Gill, Kenny Battle, Marcus Liberty, Steve Bardo, and Kiwane Garris. In 1981, Illinois made strides in its return to the national spotlight with a 21–8 record, a third-place Big Ten finish and an invitation to the NCAA Tournament. The team received a first-round bye in the NCAA Tournament and beat Wyoming, 67–65, in Los Angeles to advance to the regionals in Salt Lake City, where Illinois lost to Kansas State, 57–52. During this season, the Fighting Illini led the Big Ten in scoring for the second consecutive season and were again led by Eddie Johnson and Mark Smith. Guards Craig Tucker and Derek Harper arrived to add backcourt punch, and Harper began his Illini career being named First-Team Freshman All-America by ESPN and ABC. The top-seeded and top-ranked 1989 Illini were upset 83–81 in the Final Four on a last second basket by Michigan's Sean Higgins, ending the school's deepest run in the tournament at that time. Illinois had beaten the Wolverines by 12 and 16 points in two previous meetings that season. The 1988–89 Illinois Fighting Illini team gained the moniker \"Flyin' Illini\" by Dick Vitale during an ESPN broadcast that season. The team also gained national prominence for its athletic players, such as NCAA slam dunk champions Kenny Battle and Kendall Gill, as well as Lowell Hamilton, Nick Anderson, Marcus Liberty, and Stephen Bardo. The early 1990s Illini were dominated by players such as guards Andy Kauffman, Richard Keene, and Kiwane Garris, as well as centers Shelly Clark and Deon Thomas. Thomas was at the center of a report of misconduct by Iowa Hawkeyes men's basketball assistant coach Bruce Pearl, who alleged that Thomas had been offered cash to attend Illinois. The Illini were suspended from postseason play for one season for unrelated violations uncovered during the investigation. After longtime coach Lou Henson's departure, Illinois hired Lon Kruger to fill the vacancy for the 1996 season. Kruger was the 14th head basketball coach in program history. During his four-year tenure he compiled a 59–38 record. He immediately made an impact at Illinois leading them to a 22–10 record and a second round NCAA tournament appearance in his first year. This created excitement because of the ninth-place finish the Illini had taken just before his arrival. Kruger inherited players such as Victor Chukwudebe, Jerry Hester, Kevin Turner, Jerry Gee, Matt Heldman, Brian Johnson, Kiwane Garris and Cleotis Brown. During his four seasons at Illinois, three of which resulted in NCAA Tournament berths, (all three of which saw the Illini eliminated in the 2nd round) Kruger became the only Big Ten coach to successfully sign three consecutive Illinois Mr. Basketball winners, inking Sergio McClain, Frank Williams, and Brian Cook between 1997 and 1999.Several times during his coaching tenure the Illini were predicted to be at the bottom of the Big Ten, however he overcame adversity each time performing far better than expected. Illinois picked Tulsa coach Bill Self from a list of numerous candidates, including popular assistant Jimmy Collins, to succeed Kruger, who moved on to the NBA to coach the Atlanta Hawks. Bill Self was hired to the Illini coaching staff as the 15th head coach in the history of the program. He spent his previous seven years as the head coach of Oral Roberts University and Tulsa University where he compiled an overall record of 129–71. In 2001, his first season at Illinois, Self coached his new Fighting Illini squad to a 27–8 record, a share of the Big Ten title, and a number 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. That 27-game winning season in Self's first year was the second most winning season in school history at that time. McClain, Cook and preseason Big Ten player of the year Cory Bradford led the Illini to the Elite Eight, where they fell to eventual finalist Arizona in a much disputed contest. The Illini were accused of being overly physical most of the season, especially McClain and pesky guards Sean Harrington and Lucas Johnson (younger brother of former Illini forward Brian Johnson). The '01 Illini team also included Robert Archibald, Damir Krupalija and Marcus Griffin. With mostly the same core, Illinois followed up the season with impressive 2002 and 2003 campaigns, but fell in the Sweet 16 in 2002. He was the first head coach in the Big Ten, since 1912, to lead his team to conference championships in each of his first two seasons. It was also the first time Illinois won back-to-back titles in 50 years. Self, also, had an overall record of 78–24 in his three years as Illinois head coach. Self left for Kansas after the 2003 season.[4] Bruce Weber served as the head coach of Illinois basketball for nine seasons from 2003 to 2012. After Bill Self left, Illinois AD Ron Guenther hired Weber to coach the Fighting Illini on April 30, 2003. Weber came from Southern Illinois University (SIU) in Carbondale and was touted as a loyal coach, which was valued by the Illinois AD after both Kruger and Self left Champaign with relatively short tenures. In his five seasons as head coach at SIU, Weber took the Saluki program to the top of the Missouri Valley Conference, winning league titles in 2002 and 2003. He posted records of 28–8 and 24–7 in his last two seasons, leading the Salukis to back-to-back NCAA Tournament appearances, including a run to the Sweet 16 in 2002 with wins over Texas Tech and Georgia at the United Center in Chicago. His .689 (62–28) winning percentage in MVC play ranked 12th in the long history of the league. Weber earned Missouri Valley Conference Coach of the Year honors following the 2003 season. Illinois totaled 210 victories under Weber from 2004 to 2012. He ranks third on the Illinois career coaching wins list. He won 67.5 percent of his games while in charge of the Fighting Illini (210–101). Under Weber, the Illini had two Big Ten Championships (2004, 2005), two runner-up finishes (2006, 2009) and seven upper-division finishes. Illinois had five players selected in the NBA draft under Weber, as Deron Williams (No. 3, Utah Jazz) and Luther Head (No. 24, Houston Rockets) were taken in the first round of the 2005 NBA draft, and James Augustine (No. 41, Orlando Magic) and Dee Brown (No. 46, Utah Jazz) were chosen in the second round of the 2006 NBA draft. Meyers Leonard was chosen 11th by the Portland Trail Blazers in the 2012 NBA draft following Weber's final season. Utah's selection of Williams at No. 3 overall in the 2005 lottery made him the highest-drafted player in Illinois history. It took just one season for Weber to etch his name in the Big Ten and Illinois record books after leading the Fighting Illini to its first outright Big Ten title in 52 years during the 2003–04 season. In leading his young team that featured just one senior on the roster, Weber became just the third coach in the history of the Big Ten to win an outright title in his first season. Illinois had to win 10 straight to end the regular season to claim the championship, including six-straight wins on the road. Illinois' 26 wins in 2003–04 tied the fourth-winningest season in school history. Weber also led the Illini to the Sweet 16 with NCAA Tournament victories over Murray State and Cincinnati. Weber's second year at Illinois, the 2004–05 season, will be remembered as one of the greatest in Fighting Illini history, finishing 37–2 as the National Runner-Up in the NCAA tournament. In a remarkable year where Illinois celebrated its centennial season of basketball, the Illini reeled off 29 straight wins to start the year, tying the 12th-best start in NCAA Div. I history and the third-best start in Big Ten history. Illinois also secured its second-straight outright Big Ten championship with a 15–1 league record, as Weber became the first coach in Big Ten history to win consecutive outright titles in his first two seasons. Illinois then added a Big Ten tournament championship in addition to its regular season title. The Illini were ranked No. 1 in the nation for 15 straight weeks, including a first-ever No. 1 ranking in the final Associated Press poll. They gained the #1 overall seed in the NCAA Tournament and prevailed in one of the most memorable games in NCAA history against Arizona. Down 15 points with around 4 minutes left, the Illini rallied with a run led by Luther Head and Deron Williams. The game was sent into overtime and the Illini pulled off a one-point win to advance to the 2005 Final Four in St. Louis. It was the Fighting Illini's first Final Four Appearance since the 1988–89 season. Against the Louisville Cardinals in the national semifinal game, the Illini posted their final victory of the season. All of the five Illini starters–Deron Williams, Luther Head, Dee Brown, James Augustine, and Roger Powell, Jr.–would eventually play in the NBA. Williams and Brown both joined the Utah Jazz roster, while Luther Head went on to play for the Sacramento Kings. With all that Illinois accomplished during the season, Weber swept the 2005 National Coach of the Year awards, claiming the following: the Naismith Award, the most prestigious coaching award in college basketball; the Henry Iba Award, presented by the U.S. Basketball Writers Association; and, the Adolph F. Rupp Cup. Weber was also named National Coach of the Year by the NABC, Associated Press, The Sporting News, Basketball Times, CBS/Chevrolet, Victor Awards and Nike Championship Basketball Clinic. Despite losing three starters and 63 percent of its scoring from the 2004–05 NCAA runner-up squad, Weber directed the 2005–06 Illini to a third-consecutive 4829-win season, a runner-up finish in the Big Ten, the second round of the NCAA Tournament, and a ranking among the nation's top 17 teams throughout the entire season. The Illini spent the majority of 2005–06 ranked in the Top 10 and recorded 26 wins on the year to tie the fourth-winningest season in school history. The Illini were given a number 4 seed in the NCAA tournament, where they beat Air Force in the opening round, before falling to the University of Washington in the second round. The 2006–07 team finished with a record of 23–12 (9–7) and finished tied for fourth in the Big Ten. With a depleted roster that had six different players combine to miss a total of 58 games due to injury, the Illini still advanced to the NCAA Tournament. They were awarded a 12 seed and lost in the opening round to Virginia Tech. The 2007–08 season was one of the worst seasons in Illinois history, highlighted by a string of close losses. The lone bright spot came as Illinois came on strong to win four of its last five and five of its final seven games, which culminated with a runner-up finish at the Big Ten tournament. Weber's Illini became the first No. 10 seed in the tournament's history to advance to the title game, winning three games in three days with victories over Penn State, No. 17 Purdue, and Minnesota to reach the championship game vs. No. 8 Wisconsin. However, with an overall record of 16–19 (5–13), the Illini were not selected to participate in postseason play. Weber's 2008–09 UI squad was one of the most improved teams in the country finishing with a record of 24–10 (11–7). With 10 more regular season victories than it achieved the year before, Illinois posted the third-biggest turnaround in NCAA Division I and the second-biggest turnaround among BCS programs on the year. The Illini recorded 24 wins, ranking as the 10th winningest season in school history. Illinois was the Big Ten runner-up, earned a No. 5 seed in the 2009 NCAA Tournament, and finished the year ranked 24th in the Pomeroy rankings. The Illini lost in the first round of the NCAA tournament to the 12th-seeded Western Kentucky Hilltoppers. During the 2009–10 season, the Illini finished 21–15 (10–8) and finished 5th in the Big Ten. The team was widely considered to be \"on the bubble\" for the NCAA tournament and missed the tournament field by a narrow margin. The Illini competed in the NIT, falling at home to the Dayton Flyers in the NIT Quarterfinals. Illinois rebounded in 2010–11 to finish 20–14 (9–9) and tied for fourth in the Big Ten. The Illini were selected to join the NCAA tournament as a #9 seed, where they defeated the #8 seeded UNLV Rebels setting up a matchup with the #1 seeded Kansas Jayhawks and former coach Bill Self. Kansas proved to be too much for the Illini, and the season came to an end in the round of 32. In 2011–12, Weber's last as coach of the Illini, the team finished 17–15 (6–12), good for 9th in the conference. The team did not compete in the postseason. Illinois' new AD Mike Thomas fired Weber after the 2011–12 season. John Groce was hired by the new athletic director Mike Thomas on March 28, 2012.[5] During the 2012–13 season, the Illini were the Maui Invitational champions and later made the NCAA tournament, losing their second game to the Miami Hurricanes by a score of 63–59. The Illini spent eight weeks nationally ranked in the NCAA Division I rankings, and for two weeks were ranked as high as 10th in the country. The 2013–14 season saw major roster turnover, with nine players leaving and nine players joining the program. This season was one to forget, as the Illini would ultimately miss the NCAA Tournament and lose in the second round of the NIT. In 2014, Groce continued Illinois' success in November, improving to 21–0 under Groce and 32–0 overall during the past four seasons. Illinois is the only program in the nation with an undefeated November record dating back to 2011.[6] The 2014–2015 season was once again disappointing for the Illini. Illinois finished with a record of 19–14, finishing tied for 7th place in the Big Ten with a record of 9–9. The Illini were then beaten in the first round of the NIT. The 2015–16 season ended with the fewest total wins in almost 20 years since the 98–99 Lon Kruger crew won only 14 games. Groce's squad finished with a record of 15–19, taking 12th place in the Big Ten and receiving no post-season tournament invitations. The 2016–17 season was another disappointing season for the Fighting Illini, as they finished the season at 18–14 and 8–10 in the conference, failing to make the NCAA Tournament for the fourth consecutive year. On March 11, 2017, the university announced via press release that Groce had been relieved of his duties as head men's basketball coach. The next day, the team was put into the NIT as a 2-seed. The team was coached during the NIT by interim coach Jamall Walker, making it to the quarterfinals before being eliminated by the University of Central Florida. On March 18, 2017, Brad Underwood was hired by athletic director Josh Whitman.[7] Underwood previously coached at Stephen F. Austin from 2013 to 2016, before spending one year at Oklahoma State. In Underwood's first season at Illinois, the team won each of their first five contests. After beginning conference play 0–8, they ended the season with a record of 14–18. While the 2018–19 season featured the debut of key pieces including Ayo Dosunmu, Giorgi Bezhanishvili, Andres Feliz, and Alan Griffin, the Illini posted one of the worst records in program history at 12–21 (7–13 in Big Ten). Despite the poor record, Illinois had many memorable moments such as upsetting #9 Michigan State at home and Bezhanishvili scoring 35 points against Rutgers, breaking the Illini record for most points by a freshman in a single game. The 2019–20 season was the freshman year of highly ranked center Kofi Cockburn. The Illini started the season slow in the first game, barely beating Nicholls State 78–70 in overtime. During the ACC–Big Ten Challenge, Illinois played Miami where they lost 81–79 after they mounted a huge comeback before a charge was called against Dosunmu on the game's final play. The next game they traveled to College Park to play against #3 Maryland. The Illini led by 14 at the half, but Maryland outscored Illinois 34–19 in the second half and won the game by an Anthony Cowan free throw. The Illini next played #5 Michigan at the State Farm Center. They would beat the Wolverines 71–62 to improve to 7–3 on the season. Over the next 12 games, the Illini went 10–2, including Dosunmu's game-winning shot during their second matchup against Michigan to give Illinois a 64–62 lead with half a second left on the clock. Illinois would finish the season with a 21–10 (13–7) record which would be good enough for 4th in the Big Ten. They would also finish ranked 21st in the AP Poll and 22nd in the Coaches Poll. The 2020–21 season that Underwood finally had mostly his recruits running the team and it certainly showed on the court. After much deliberation, Ayo Dosunmu returned to Illinois for his junior season instead of going to the NBA. He, along with Kofi Cockburn, helped make Illinois into a top-10 team. They went 16-4 (0.800) in the B1G conference but had a worse record than Michigan (14-3, 0.824), and therefore did not earn even a share of the title. This title was disputed as Michigan had failed to play three extra games because of COVID protocols, and only one loss in those three games would have given Illinois the title; Illinois had beaten Michigan by 23 without leading scorer Ayo Dosunmu in Ann Arbor. The team went on to win the Big Ten tournament title, however, after a hard-fought, overtime 91–88 win over OSU. Illinois became a #1 seed in the NCAA Tournament for the 4th time in school history. They were upset by Loyola-Chicago in the 2nd round and finished the season 24–7. Dosunmu became the first player in Illini history to earn 1st-team All-America honors by the AP. Cockburn was named to the AP All-American 2nd-team. Before the 2021–22 season, Ayo Dosunmu was drafted by the Chicago Bulls, and Adam Miller transferred to LSU, leading to André Curbelo being expected to serve as the primary ball handler. Unfortunately, Curbelo suffered a concussion prior to the season opener that would continue to affect him throughout the season. The team was led by fifth-year players Trent Frazier and Da'Monte Williams. Kofi Cockburn returned for his junior year but was suspended for the first three games for selling his team jerseys during the off-season. The team tied with Wisconsin for a share of the Big Ten regular season title, with a record of 15-5. Due to the tiebreaker rules, the team was seeded first in the Big Ten Tournament but lost its first game to ninth-seeded Indiana. The team was given the #4 seed in the South region of the NCAA tournament. After a 54-53 victory against Chattanooga, the team lost in the second round to Houston. Cockburn was named to the AP All-American 1st-team. The roster suffered from some major turnover before the 2022–23 season, with five players transferring out of the program, four players graduating, and Kofi Cockburn electing to stay in the NBA draft (and ultimately going undrafted). Three players transferred into the program and six freshmen were recruited. As a result of the roster changes, the team would be led by Terrence Shannon Jr. and Coleman Hawkins. The Illini would secure two major wins in non-conference play, beating #8 UCLA in the Continental Tire Main Event semifinal and #2 Texas in the Jimmy V Classic. Both Zacharie Perrin and Skyy Clark left the program during the season. Ultimately the season was a step back for the program, as due to tiebreaker rules, the team received a seven seed and lost to Penn State in their first game of the Big Ten Tournament. The team then received the #9 seed in the West region and lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament to Arkansas. For the first time since Underwood's second season, the team finished the season unranked in the AP Poll. The 2023-24 season would be one to remember. Three pivotal graduate transfers, Marcus Domask, Quincy Guerrier, and Justin Harmon joined the team, with Domask and Guerrier starting most games. The Illini went on an undefeated trip to Spain and then beat #1 ranked Kansas in a televised exhibition game. The team lost only two games to non-NCAA tournament teams, once to Penn State and once to Maryland. After finishing second in the Big Ten standings, the team ultimately won the Big Ten Tournament, prevailing over Wisconsin. The team was selected to the NCAA tournament as the #3 seed in the East region. For the first time in Underwood's tenure, the team made the Sweet Sixteen, where it beat the #2 seed, Iowa State. For the first time since the 2004–05 season, the team made the Elite Eight, where it lost to #1-overall and eventual national champion UConn. Record Champion Bids † – Conference co-champions The NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition. The NIT began seeding the tournament with the 2006 edition. Kenney Gym Annex is a 5,000-seat multi-purpose arena that is the practice facility for the Fighting Illini gymnastics team. Before the opening of Huff Hall in 1925, Kenney Gym housed the Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team. It also was home to the Women's Volleyball program from 1974 until 1989, after which the program moved to Huff Hall in 1990. Huff Hall is a 4,050-seat multi-purpose arena in Champaign, Illinois, United States. The arena opened in 1925 and was known as Huff Gymnasium until the 1990s. It is named after George Huff, the school's athletic director from 1895 to 1935. Huff Hall is home to the University of Illinois Fighting Illini volleyball and wrestling teams. Before the opening of Assembly Hall in 1963, it was home to the basketball team as well. Assembly Hall opened on March 2, 1963, and hosts the home games for the men's and women's basketball teams. Max Abramovitz, an Illinois alumnus, was the lead architect behind the building of the indoor arena. At the time of its opening, Assembly Hall could hold 16,128 people, making it the largest dome structure in North America until the Houston Astrodome opened in 1965. In 2008, school officials, led by athletic director Ron Guenther, conducted a study to decide whether to refurbish the Assembly Hall or build a new basketball arena. In 2010, they decided to keep the arena. In 2014, renovations began under the watch of AECOM, an architectural firm based out of Dallas Texas. The estimated cost of the project was estimated to be around $169.5 million and in turn State Farm Insurance decided to buy the naming rights of the stadium. The 2-story, 40,000-square-foot building is home to the University of Illinois Men's and Women's basketball programs. The facility includes offices, locker areas, weight training facilities and team meeting rooms in addition to the practice basketball courts. The Illinois Champions Campaign was a major catalyst of the $40 million renovation.[8] In November 2015, the arena hosted the team for five games while renovations to the State Farm Center were completed.[9] Illinois and Indiana's rivalry started because the teams share a state border and they are located about 153 miles (246 km) apart. They have played annually since 1906. Indiana currently leads the series 96–92. The teams have played each other in five top-ten matchups, the first coming in 1952 when 2nd-ranked Illinois beat 4th-ranked Indiana 78–66. The longest winning streak was when Indiana won nine consecutive matchups from 1972 to 1977. Illinois has had a total of 34 players who have claimed All-American status. † = Consensus All-American In 2004, during the celebration of the program's 100th year of basketball as a varsity sport, the University of Illinois Division of Intercollegiate Athletics announced its All-Century Team. The 20-man team was selected after online voting by fans and the Illinois Basketball Centennial Committee. The honorees were feted during the Illinois Basketball Centennial Reunion Weekend, Jan. 28–30, 2005.[24] † Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee. ‡ National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame inductee. § Illinois Basketball Coaches Association Hall of Fame inductee.

The award was annually given to a male student-athlete until it was discontinued in 1973. Revived in 1983, the University of Illinois now recognizes both male and female athletes who have distinguished themselves in athletic achievement. In 1993, the awards were named in honor of former Olympian Dwight \"Dike\" Eddleman, who participated in basketball, football and track and field in 1943 and 1946–49, earning a combined 11 varsity letters during that timeframe.[77] The following list includes Illini basketball players who earned the award.

                "content": "The Illinois Fighting Illini (/ɪˈlaɪnaɪ/) are the intercollegiate athletic teams that represent the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The university offers 10 men's and 11 women's varsity sports. The university operates a number of athletic facilities, including Memorial Stadium for football, the State Farm Center for both men's and women's basketball, Illinois Field for baseball, the ARC Pool for women's swimming and diving, the Atkins Tennis Center for men's and women's tennis, Eichelberger Field for softball, Huff Hall for men's and women's gymnastics, women's volleyball and men's wrestling, Demirjian Park for women's soccer and for men's and women's outdoor track and field, the Atkins Golf Club at the University of Illinois for men's and women's golf, the University of Illinois Arboretum for cross country and the University of Illinois Armory for men's and women's indoor track and field. The Fighting Illini lay claim to over 25 National Championships dating back to 1900. The University of Illinois official team name is the Fighting Illini.[2] The Illiniwek, Illinois Confederation, or Illini, were made up of 12 to 13 tribes who lived in the Mississippi River Valley. The term \"Illini\", in relation to campus activities, appears to be first mentioned in January 1874, when the weekly newspaper changed its name from The Student to The Illini. An editorial in the first edition of the renamed newspaper indicated that Illini was a new term. During the late 19th century and beginning of the 20th century, it was used to refer to the students, faculty, staff, and alumni of the university, as well as to the campus as a whole. Many NCAA and High School mascots bearing reference to first nation people have changed their names. However, the University of Illinois maintains its position that the Illini nickname does not refer to the first nation inhabitants of the same land.[3] The term Illini referring to the university's athletic teams seems to come from secondhand accounts of the athletic teams. The earliest reference in the Illio yearbook appears to be one mention in the summary of the 1907 football season. The term was more widely used in the 1910s especially during the 1914, 1915, and 1916 football seasons. The Daily Illini and football programs prior to these dates do not extensively cite the term and also used the terms \"Indians\", \"our men\", \"Orange and Blue\", and the \"homecomers\".[3] The Illinois Confederation, also referred to as the Illiniwek or Illini, lived in the Mississippi River Valley and expanded their tribes in an area that stretched from Lake Michigan to Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, and Arkansas.[4] The term Fighting Illini first appeared in a January 29, 1911, newspaper article describing the basketball team's effort during a game versus Purdue. By March 3, 1911, the athletic teams appeared to have earned the Fighting Illini nickname as a formal appellation evidenced in a newspaper report. In 2005, evidence suggested Fighting Illini was first used in 1921 as part of a fundraising campaign for construction of Memorial Stadium, but articles discovered in 2013 show it was first used in 1911.[2] The Fighting Illini nickname was adopted by general consensus as an unofficial school nickname sometime between 1921 and 1930. It was then used in newspaper articles, football programs and other publications eventually becoming the official name.[2] Illinois has won 18 overall men's and women's NCAA team national championships through the 2017 NCAA athletic season.[5] Illinois ranks thirty-sixth all-time in total NCAA Division I national championships through the 2020–21 NCAA athletic season.[5] Fighting Illini baseball has 10 NCAA Tournament appearances, 33 Big Ten championships and 4 Big Ten Tournament championships in 1989, 1990, 2000 and 2011. Fighting Illini men's basketball titles include the 1915 Helms national championship, five NCAA Final Four appearances in 1949, 1951, 1952, 1989, 2005, 17 Big Ten championships and four Big Ten Tournament championships in 2003, 2005, 2021, and 2024. Through the end of the 2013–14 season, Illinois ranks 11th all-time in winning percentage and 14th all-time in wins among all NCAA Division I men's college basketball programs. Fighting Illini women's basketball began play in 1974. The team won the 1997 Big Ten championship. They have made 8 NCAA Tournament appearances, including 2 Sweet Sixteen appearances in 1997 and 1998. The men's cross country team were the Big Ten Champions in 1921, 1947 and 1984. The Fighting Illini women's cross country team began play in 1977. Illinois won an individual NCAA championship in 2009. The University of Illinois has been selected for national championship titles for their accomplishments in five seasons (1914, 1919, 1923, 1927, 1951) by NCAA-designated major selectors, often using mathematical algorithms.[6][7]: 111–113 Illinois claims championships for all five years.[8] The Fighting Illini program recognizes the 1951 co-national title selection by William F. Boand,[9] but as recently as 2006 this was not mentioned officially by the school.[10] The team also has 15 Big Ten Championship Football victories with 8 Bowl Game Victories at the 1947 Rose Bowl, 1952 Rose Bowl, 1964 Rose Bowl, 1990 Florida Citrus Bowl, 1994 Liberty Bowl, 1999 MicronPC.com Bowl, 2010 Texas Bowl, and 2011 Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl. The men's golf team play their home matches on the Atkins Golf Club at the University of Illinois five miles from the university's campus, and are currently led by head coach Mike Small. The Fighting Illini men's golf program has won 18 Big Ten championships and in 2013 finished as national runner-up at the NCAA Division I Men's Golf Championships, which was the highest finish in the program's history. 2014 was the third time in the past four years the program had qualified for the match play portion of the NCAA Men's Golf Championships in which the final eight teams compete in a bracket format.[11] The Fighting Illini women's golf team began play in 1975. The team has made four NCAA Tournament appearances in 2002, 2003, 2011 and 2012. The men's gymnastics team have been invited to 44 NCAA tournaments and have won 10 team NCAA championships, which is second most all-time only to Penn State Nittany Lions 12 team titles. Additionally, the Fighting Illini have won an all-time record 53 individual NCAA titles.[12] The Illini hold their competitions at George Huff Hall on the Champaign side of campus, and the team trains and holds practices at the Kenney Gym on the Urbana side of campus.[13] The Fighting Illini women's gymnastics team began play in 1974. The team won three Big Ten Championships in 1990, 1991 and 1992. The Fighting Illini women's soccer team began play in 1997. The team won two Big Ten Championships in 2003 and 2011. They have made twelve NCAA Tournaments appearances in 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. The team has four sweet sixteen appearances in 2004, 2006, 2008, 2013 and one elite eight appearance in 2004. The Illini are currently led by Janet Rayfield, who has been the head coach since 2002.[14] The Fighting Illini softball team began play in 2000. The team has made eight NCAA Tournament appearances in 2003, 2004, 2009, 2010, 2016, 2017, 2019, and 2022. The current head coach is Tyra Perry. The Fighting Illini women's swimming and diving team began play in 1974. The team had individual NCAA champions in 1983, 1984, 1985, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1995, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007. The Illinois men's tennis program was founded in 1908, but has enjoyed most of its success in recent years. The Illini have been one of the most successful men's tennis programs in the nation over the past twenty seasons, winning nine consecutive Big Ten Championships from 1997 to 2005; six of seven Big Ten Tournament Championships between 1999 and 2005; appearing in the NCAA Sweet Sixteen fourteen times, including eight years in a row (2002–09); advancing to three NCAA Final Fours between 2003 and 2007; and winning the 2003 NCAA National Championship. They have also won two ITA National Team Indoor Championships (2003, 2004)[15] and lost in the championship match three other times (1998, 1999, 2002). Illinois men's tennis owns the record for longest consecutive win streak in NCAA history at 64 matches, spanning from their first match of the 2002–03 season and ending with a 4–2 defeat by UCLA in the semifinals of the 2004 NCAA Men's Tennis Tournament. The Fighting Illini women's tennis team began play in 1975. The women's tennis team has made 13 NCAA Tournament appearances in 1996, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2018 and 2019.

The Fighting Illini women's track and field team began play in 1976.[citation needed] The indoor track and field team won five Big Ten Championships in 1989, 1992, 1993, 1995 and 1996. The outdoor track and field team won the 1970 Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women national championship[17][18] and six Big Ten Championships in 1988, 1989, 1992, 1995, 2005 and 2007. Women's volleyball started in 1974.,[19] Since moving into Huff Hall from the Kenney Gym in 1990, the Illinois Volleyball team has remained in the top 10 in the nation for average home attendance. In 2013, the program broke its previous home attendance record, averaging 3,117 per match.[20] Kenney Gym served as the initial home court from 1974 through the 1989 season. Since the founding of the volleyball program in 1974, the Fighting Illini have had 30+ winning seasons. The current head coach of the University of Illinois Fighting Illini is Mike Poeta, who was a two-time NCAA finalist for Illinois. He replaced Jim Heffernan, who retired in 2021. State Farm Center is the current home arena for the wrestling team, seating approximately 15,500. Huff Hall served as home arena to the team since 1925.

Fencing was dropped as a varsity sport in 1993. Men's swimming and diving was dropped as a varsity sport in 1993, but were Big Ten Champions in 1911, 1912 and 1913. Club sports include men's ice hockey, women's ice hockey, men's lacrosse, rowing, men's and women's rugby, tennis, men's volleyball, men's and women's soccer, men's and women's ultimate frisbee, men's and women's cross country, men's and women's track and field, and men's and women's boxing. Both the men's and women's boxing teams compete as part of the United States Intercollegiate Boxing Association. Illinois hosted the USIBA national championships in 2018, and the men's team won the 2018 and 2019 tournaments.[30][31] The women's team won the 2022 tournament.[32] The men's ice hockey team has played in the Division I Central States Collegiate Hockey League conference since 1979, which is part of the American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA), winning national championships in 2005 and 2008, with runner-up finishes in 2009 and 2018. A second team competes in the Division II Mid-American Collegiate Hockey Association. A feasibility study published in March 2018, and commissioned by the NHL, NHLPA, and College Hockey, Inc., found a high probability of success for the hockey program to transition to NCAA Division I.[33][34] Founded in 1963, the University of Illinois Men's Rugby Football Club plays in Division 1-A in the Big Ten Universities conference. The Illini have experienced success in college rugby, including winning several Big 10 championships in the 1980s and reaching the national semifinals in 1980, 1983 and 1985.[35][36] The Illini play their home matches in Urbana at the Complex Fields. The men's wheelchair basketball team was founded in 1948 by Timothy Nugent in response to a large number of disabled veterans using the G.I. Bill to attend the University of Illinois.[37] Nugent later started a women's team in 1970. A total of 29 national championships are claimed between the men and women's teams. Founded in 2005, Illini Rowing is one of the youngest university rowing teams in the country. They practice on Clinton Lake and in the ARC.[38] On Clinton Lake, they host the Illinois Collegiate Rowing Invitational where they race against many other midwestern universities.[39] They compete across the country in the American Collegiate Rowing Association.[40] The Marching Illini is the marching band of the university. The Marching Illini is an organization which annually includes approximately 350 students. Part of the College of Fine and Applied Arts and the School of Music, the Marching Illini represent virtually every college, discipline, and major on the university's diverse Urbana-Champaign campus. The band primarily performs before, during, and after University of Illinois home football games. The band also performs an indoor concert at the Krannert Center for the Performing Arts featuring special lighting effects, performances by individual sections, and slightly pithy comic routines. The Sousa Archives and Center for American Music houses a collection of University Band recordings and performances and recording sessions from 1940 to 1987.[41] The band has several traditions such as the Pregame Show, Three-In-One, Illinois Loyalty and Oskee Wow-Wow. Illinois Loyalty is the main school song of the university. It was first performed on March 3, 1906, and is one of the oldest songs of its kind in the United States. The song was written by Thacher Howland Guild, instructor in rhetoric and a member of the band's solo cornet section.[42] Due to the song's length, it is normally played only at the beginning, halftime, and end of football games. Oskee Wow-Wow is the official fight song of the University of Illinois.[43] Most commonly, it is played \"from the hold\" at the start of the chorus, when the \"O\" in \"Oskee Wow-Wow\" is held out. This version is played after first downs and touchdowns in football, and leading into time outs in basketball. Coincidentally, the buzzers at nearly every arena are in the same chord as the hold. For many years, the band started playing the song \"from the top\" toward the end of the warmup period in basketball. When conducted correctly, the \"hold\" is played just as the buzzer sounds. The Oskee Wow-Wow yell is a University of Illinois spirit yell originated in 1899. The yell was modified in 1912 and 1916.[43][44] The university has a number of notable alumni and administrators in the world of athletics. In football, notable Alumni include Dick Butkus, Red Grange, Jeff George, Simeon Rice, Ray Nitschke and George Halas. Famous basketball alumni include Dee Brown, Deron Williams, Luther Head, Derek Harper, Nick Anderson, Chuck Carney, Brian Cook, Kendall Gill, Steve Bardo, Jerry Colangelo, and Johnny Orr. Notable athletes in baseball include Lou Boudreau,[45] Hoot Evers[46] and Ken Holtzman. The university has also a number of Olympic athletes that include George Kerr, Don Laz, Daniel Kinsey, Harold Osborn, Bob Richards, and Justin Spring, From 1926 to 2007, Chief Illiniwek was the symbol for the Fighting Illini. Chief Illiniwek was a Native American symbol portrayed by a white student.[47] Chief Illiniwek symbolized the Illini, a confederation of indigenous tribes who historically had inhabited much of present-day Illinois; however the clothing and regalia for the symbol was from the Sioux nation. Chief Illiniwek would perform during halftime at Illinois football and basketball games, wearing a feathered headdress and buckskin clothes, and dancing while the marching band played \"Three in One\", an arrangement of three original songs. It was customary for Illinois fans and attendees to raise their arms at the end of the halftime proceedings and, in unison, yell \"chief\". In 2005, the Chief was one of 18 mascots (though Illiniwek was considered a symbol and not a mascot) cited as \"hostile or abusive\" by the NCAA in a policy that banned schools from full participation in postseason activities as long as they continued to use such mascots.[48] The University of Illinois retired Chief Illiniwek in 2007. Debate about the Chief has continued to this day.[49][50] The university chancellor appointed a Commission on Native Imagery to recommend ways \"to provide closure, healing and reconciliation... to facilitate the establishment of new traditions... [and] to honor and partner with the Native Nations for whom Illinois is their ancestral home.\"[51] The Fighting Illini are one of three Big Ten programs that do not have a mascot. (The other two are the Wolverines and the Hoosiers.)[52] In the 2020 student elections, the student body voted 4222 to 3597 for a preliminary proposal to adopt a new mascot, the belted kingfisher. The female belted kingfisher, which is \"naturally true to the orange and blue,\" would be the first female mascot in the Big Ten—and Illinois' first mascot.[53] The referendum was downplayed by the university administration, which stated that the \"results will be shared with the university administration and the board of trustees but will not result in a new mascot at this time.\"[54] After the student referendum, the University Senate voted 105–2 in an advisory vote to endorse the belted kingfisher as the new [in fact, the first] mascot.[55]",

Cleveland Cavaliers @ Dallas Mavericks Current Records: Cleveland 29-4, Dallas 20-14 The Cavaliers and the Mavericks are an even 5-5 against one another since November of 2019, but not for long. The Cleveland Cavaliers will be staying on the road on Friday to face off against the Dallas Mavericks at 8:30 p.m. ET at American Airlines Center. The Cavaliers are strutting in with some offensive muscle as they've averaged 122.4 points per game this season. The Cavaliers can't be too worried about heading out to take on the Mavericks: they just beat the Lakers at home, who had been dominant on their own court up to that point. The Cavaliers walked away with a 122-110 victory over the Lakers on Tuesday. The Cavaliers can attribute much of their success to Jarrett Allen, who dropped a double-double on 27 points and 14 rebounds. With that strong performance, Allen is now averaging an impressive 10.1 rebounds per game. The Cavaliers were working as a unit and finished the game with 32 assists (they're ranked fifth in assists per game overall). That strong performance was nothing new for the team: they've now posted at least 25 assists in 12 consecutive contests. Meanwhile, the Mavericks' recent rough patch got a bit rougher on Wednesday after their third straight defeat. They opened the new year with a less-than-successful 110-99 loss to the Rockets. Cleveland is on a roll lately: they've won 12 of their last 13 matchups, which provided a nice bump to their 29-4 record this season. As for Dallas, their defeat dropped their record down to 20-14. Looking forward, the Cavaliers are the favorite in this one, as the experts expect to see them win by seven points. This contest will be their 18th straight as the favorites (so far over this stretch they are 12-5 against the spread). The Cavaliers skirted past the Mavericks 121-119 in their previous matchup back in February of 2024. The rematch might be a little tougher for the Cavaliers since the team won't have the home-court advantage this time around. We'll see if the change in venue makes a difference. Cleveland is a solid 7-point favorite against Dallas, according to the latest NBA odds. The line has drifted a bit towards the Cavaliers, as the game opened with the Cavaliers as a 4.5-point favorite. The over/under is 230.5 points.

The NBA-leading Cavs improved to 30-4, swept a four-game Western Conference road trip and are now 10-0 against the West. All nine wins in the streak have been by double digits. The Mavericks played without both of their All-Star guards, Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving.

Caris LeVert scored 17 off the bench for Cleveland. Quentin Grimes scored 26 points, 20 in the third period, to lead the Mavericks, who have lost four straight to match a season long losing streak. Jaden Hardy added 17 off the bench and Klay Thompson scored 16, all in the first half. The Cavaliers used a 20-point run to go from a 21-17 deficit late in the first period to a 37-21 lead early in the second. Their largest lead was 27 points. Cavaliers: Six players have averaged double figures in scoring this season. They had seven in this game. Mavericks: The defending West champions went into Christmas Day 4 1/2 games behind first-place Oklahoma City and now trail by 9 1/2. Back-to-back 3s by Thompson pulled the Mavericks within 64-53 with 44 seconds left in the half. But the Cavaliers closed with five straight points, LeVert getting a friendly bounce on a left-corner 3 with four seconds left, to lead 69-53 at halftime. The Cavaliers outscored the Mavericks 18-0 in first-half turnover points and matched a season low with eight overall, two in the first half. The Cavaliers will host the Charlotte Hornets on Sunday night. The Mavericks visit the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday night. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

                "content": "Associazione Calcio Milan (Italian pronunciation: [assotʃatˈtsjoːne ˈkaltʃo ˈmiːlan]), commonly referred to as AC Milan (Italian pronunciation: [a tˌtʃi mˈmiːlan]) or simply Milan,[6] is an Italian professional football club based in Milan, Lombardy. Founded in 1899, the club competes in the Serie A, the top tier of Italian football. In its early history, Milan played its home games in different grounds around the city before moving to its current stadium, the San Siro, in 1926.[7] The stadium, which was built by Milan's second chairman, Piero Pirelli and has been shared with Inter Milan since 1947,[8] is the largest in Italian football, with a total capacity of 75,817.[9] The club has a long-standing rivalry with Inter, with whom they contest the Derby della Madonnina, one of the most followed derbies in football.[10] Milan has spent its entire history in Serie A with the exception of the 1980–81 and 1982–83 seasons.[11][12] Silvio Berlusconi’s 31-year tenure as Milan president was a standout period in the club's history, as they established themselves as one of Europe's most dominant and successful clubs. Milan won 29 trophies during his tenure, securing multiple Serie A and UEFA Champions League titles. During the 1991–92 season, the club notably achieved the feat of being the first team to win the Serie A title without losing a single game.[13] Milan is home to multiple Ballon d'Or winners, and three of the club's players, Marco van Basten, Ruud Gullit, and Frank Rijkaard, were ranked in the top three on the podium for the 1988 Ballon d'Or, an unprecedented achievement in the history of the prize.[14] Domestically, Milan has won 19 league titles,[15] 5 Coppa Italia titles and 7 Supercoppa Italiana titles.[16] In international competitions, Milan is Italy's most successful club.[nb 1][16][17][18][19] The club has won seven European Cup/Champions League titles, making them the competition's second-most successful team behind Real Madrid, and further honours include five UEFA Super Cups, two UEFA Cup Winners' Cups, a joint record[nb 2] two Latin Cups, a joint record[nb 3] three Intercontinental Cups and one FIFA Club World Cup.[16] Milan is one of the wealthiest clubs in Italian and world football.[20] It was a founding member of the now-defunct G-14 group of Europe's leading football clubs as well as its replacement, the European Club Association.[21] \"Saremo una squadra di diavoli. I nostri colori saranno il rosso come il fuoco e il nero come la paura che incuteremo agli avversari.\" \"We will be a team of devils. Our colours will be red like fire and black like the fear we will invoke in our opponents.\" AC Milan was founded as Milan Foot-Ball and Cricket Club in 1899 by English expatriate Herbert Kilpin.[12] The club claims 16 December of that year as their foundation date,[24] but historical evidence seems to suggest that the club was actually founded a few days after, most likely on 18 December.[2] However, with the club's charter being lost, the exact date remains open to debate. In honour of its English origins, the club has retained the English spelling of the city's name, as opposed to the Italian spelling Milano, which it was forced to bear under the fascist regime. Milan won its first Italian championship in 1901, interrupting a three-year hegemony of Genoa, and a further two in succession in 1906 and 1907.[11] The club proved successful in the first decade of its existence, with several important trophies won, including, among others, the Medaglia del Re three times,[25] the Palla Dapples 23 times[26] and the FGNI tournament five times, a competition organized by the Italian Gymnastics Federation but not officially recognized by the Italian Football Federation.[27] In 1908, Milan experienced a split caused by internal disagreements over the signing of foreign players, which led to the forming of another Milan-based team, F.C. Internazionale.[28] Following these events, Milan did not manage to win a single domestic title until 1950–51,[16] with some exceptions represented by the 1915–16 Coppa Federale[29] and the 1917–18 Coppa Mauro,[30] two tournaments played during the First World War which, especially the former, received a lot of attention and proved to be highly competitive, despite them not being officially recognized by the Italian federation. The 1950s saw the club return to the top of Italian football, headed by the famous Gre-No-Li Swedish trio Gunnar Gren, Gunnar Nordahl and Nils Liedholm. This was one of the club's most successful periods domestically, with the Scudetto going to Milan in 1951, 1955, 1957 and 1959.[16] This decade witnessed also the first European successes of Milan, with the 1951 and 1956 Latin Cup triumphs against Lille and Athletic Bilbao. Milan was also the first Italian club to take part to the newly born European Cup in the 1955–56 season, and reached the final two years later, when they were defeated by Real Madrid. The 1960s began with the debut of Milan's legend Gianni Rivera in 1960:[31] he would remain with the club for the rest of his career for the following 19 seasons. In 1961, Nereo Rocco was appointed as new coach of the club,[32] which under his leadership won immediately a scudetto in 1961–62, followed, in the next season, by Milan's first European Cup triumph, achieved after beating Benfica in the final.[33][34] This success was repeated in 1969, with a 4–1 win over Ajax in the final, which was followed by the Intercontinental Cup title the same year.[16] During this period Milan also won its ninth scudetto, its first Coppa Italia, with victory over Padova in the 1967 final, and two European Cup Winners' Cups in 1967–68 and 1972–73, after defeating in the last match Hamburg and Leeds United respectively.[16] Domestically, the 1970s were characterized by the pursuit of the 10th Serie A title, which grants the winner the Scudetto star. For three years in a row, in 1971, 1972 and 1973, Milan ended up second in the league, after some memorable duels with Inter and Juventus. Finally, the achievement was reached in 1979. The same year saw the retirement of Gianni Rivera and the debut of Franco Baresi, at his first full season with the club. After this success, the team went into a period of decline. The club in 1980 was involved in the Totonero scandal and as punishment was relegated to Serie B for the first time in its history.[35] The scandal was centred around a betting syndicate paying players and officials to fix the outcome of matches.[35] Milan achieved promotion back to Serie A at the first attempt, winning the 1980–81 Serie B title,[16] but were again relegated a year later as the team ended its 1981–82 campaign in third-last place. In 1983, Milan won the Serie B title for the second time in three seasons to return to Serie A,[16] where they achieved a sixth-place finish in 1983–84. On 20 February 1986, entrepreneur Silvio Berlusconi (who owned Fininvest and Mediaset) acquired the club and saved it from bankruptcy after investing vast amounts of money,[11] appointing rising manager Arrigo Sacchi at the helm of the Rossoneri and signing Dutch internationals Ruud Gullit, Marco van Basten and Frank Rijkaard.[11] The Dutch trio added an attacking impetus to the team, and complemented the club's Italian internationals Paolo Maldini, Franco Baresi, Alessandro Costacurta and Roberto Donadoni. Under Sacchi, Milan won its first Scudetto in nine years in the 1987–88 season. The following year, the club won its first European Cup in two decades, beating Romanian club Steaua București 4–0 in the final. Milan retained their title with a 1–0 win over Benfica a year later and was the last team to win back-to-back European Cups until Real Madrid's win in 2017.[36] The Milan team of 1988–1990, nicknamed the \"Immortals\" in the Italian media,[37] has been voted the best club side of all time in a global poll of experts conducted by World Soccer magazine.[38] After Sacchi left Milan in 1991, he was replaced by the club's former player Fabio Capello whose team won three consecutive Serie A titles between 1992 and 1994, a spell which included a 58-match unbeaten run in Serie A (which earned the team the label \"the Invincibles\"),[37][39][40] and back-to-back UEFA Champions League final appearances in 1993, 1994 and 1995. A year after losing 1–0 to Marseille in the 1993 Champions League final, Capello's team reached its peak in one of Milan's most memorable matches of all time, the famous 4–0 win over Barcelona in the 1994 Champions League final.[39] Capello's side went on to win the 1995–96 league title before he left to manage Real Madrid in 1996.[39] In 1998–99, after a two-year period of decline, Milan lifted its 16th championship in the club's centenary season. Milan's next period of success came under another former player, Carlo Ancelotti. After his appointment in November 2001, Ancelotti took Milan to the 2003 Champions League final, where they defeated Juventus on penalties to win the club's sixth European Cup.[41] The team then won the Scudetto in 2003–04 before reaching the 2005 Champions League final, where they were beaten by Liverpool on penalties despite leading 3–0 at half-time.[41] Two years later, the two teams met again in the 2007 Champions League final, with Milan winning 2–1 to lift the title for a seventh time.[41][42] The team then won its first FIFA Club World Cup in December 2007.[43] In 2009, after becoming Milan's second longest serving manager with 420 matches overseen,[43] Ancelotti left the club to take over as manager at Chelsea. During this period, the club was involved in the Calciopoli scandal, where five teams were accused of fixing matches by selecting favourable referees.[44] A police inquiry excluded any involvement of Milan managers;[45] the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) unilaterally decided that it had sufficient evidence to charge Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani. As a result, Milan was initially punished with a 15-point deduction and was banned from the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League. An appeal saw that penalty reduced to eight points,[46] which allowed the club to retain its Champions League participation. Following the aftermath of Calciopoli, local rivals Internazionale dominated Serie A, winning four Scudetti. However, with the help a strong squad boasting players such as Zlatan Ibrahimović, Robinho and Alexandre Pato joining many of the veterans of the club's mid-decade European successes, Milan recaptured the Scudetto in the 2010–11 Serie A season, their first since the 2003–04 season and 18th overall.[47][48] After their 18th Scudetto, the club declined in performance. Milan failed to qualify to European competitions for a few years, and the only trophy won was the 2016 Supercoppa Italiana, achieved under Vincenzo Montella's coaching after defeating Juventus in the penalty shoot-out.[citation needed] On 5 August 2016, a new preliminary agreement was signed with the Chinese investment management company Sino-Europe Sports Investment Management Changxing Co., to which Fininvest sold a 99.93% stake of Milan for about €520 million, plus the refurbishment of the club financial debt of €220 million.[49] On 13 April 2017, the deal was completed and Rossoneri Sport Investment Lux became the new direct parent company of the club.[50] In order to finalise the deal, American hedge fund Elliott Management Corporation provided Li with a loan of €303 million (€180 million to complete the payment to Fininvest and €123 million issued directly to the club).[51][52] On 10 July 2018, Li failed to keep up with his loan repayment plan, neglecting to deposit a €32 million instalment on time in order to refinance the €303 million loan debt owed to the American hedge fund. As a result, In July 2018, chairman Li Yonghong's investment vehicle Rossoneri Champion Inv. Lux. was removed as the shareholder of Rossoneri Sport Inv. Lux., the direct parent company of the club, making the investment vehicle majority controlled by Elliott Management Corporation the sole shareholder of Rossoneri Sport Inv. Lux.[53][54][55][56] On 27 November 2017, Montella was sacked due to poor results and replaced by former player Gennaro Gattuso.[57] Milan qualified for the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League group stage after finishing 6th in the 2017–18 Serie A season, but were banned by UEFA from European competition due to violations of Financial Fair Play regulations for failure to break-even.[58] Milan appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport and the decision was overturned on 20 July 2018.[59][60][61] In Gattuso's first full season in charge, Milan exceeded expectations and spent much of the campaign in the top 4. Despite winning their final 4 games, Milan missed out on the Champions League by one point.[62] After Milan's failure to qualify for the Champions League, Gattuso resigned as manager.[63] On 19 June 2019, Milan hired former Sampdoria manager Marco Giampaolo on a 2-year contract. On 28 June 2019, Milan was excluded from the 2019–20 UEFA Europa League for violating Financial Fair Play regulations for the years 2014–2017 and 2015–2018.[64] After four months in charge, Giampaolo was sacked after losing four of his first seven games, which was exacerbated by poor performances and a lack of supporter confidence. Stefano Pioli was hired as his replacement.[65] After the restart of the Serie A campaign due to the COVID-19 outbreak, Milan went on a 10 match unbeaten streak, winning 7 in the process including matches against Juventus, Lazio and Roma. This streak led to Milan abandoning their plans of hiring Ralf Rangnick as their new manager and sporting director, and instead extended Pioli's contract for a further 2 years.[66] Following a stellar start in the 2020–21 Serie A, which was a continuation of the second half of the previous season, Milan under Pioli in his first full season were led to a second-place finish in the league which was the highest finish for the team since the 2011–12 Serie A. This result allowed Milan to qualify for the 2021–22 UEFA Champions League for the following season, which would become their first appearance in the UEFA Champions League in seven years since their last appearance in the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League. Milan secured their 19th Italian championship title on the last round of the 2021–22 season, with a club-record tally of 86 points. It was their first league title since the 2010–11 season. In the Serie A Awards, Rafael Leão was named as the league's most valuable player, Mike Maignan as the best goalkeeper, and Pioli as coach of the season.[67][68][69] On 1 June 2022, RedBird Capital Partners agreed to acquire AC Milan at $1.3 billion, meanwhile Elliott Management Corporation would keep a minority stake.[70] After five seasons with Milan, Pioli stepped down at the end of 2023–24 season and Paulo Fonseca was named as his replacement.[71] Red and black are the colours which have represented the club throughout its entire history. They were chosen by its founder Herbert Kilpin to represent the players' fiery ardor (red) and the opponents' fear to challenge the team (black). Rossoneri, the team's widely used nickname, literally means \"the red & blacks\" in Italian, in reference to the colours of the stripes on its jersey.[72] Another nickname derived from the club's colours is the Devil. An image of a red devil was used as Milan's logo at one point with a Golden Star for Sport Excellence located next to it.[73] As is customary in Italian football, the star above the logo was awarded to the club after winning 10 league titles, in 1979. The official Milan logos have always displayed the Flag of Milan, which was originally the flag of Saint Ambrose,[73] next to red and black stripes. The modern badge used today represents the club colours and the flag of the Comune di Milano, with the acronym ACM at the top and the foundation year (1899) at the bottom.[73] For what concerns the badge worn on match kits, from the origins to the mid-1940s it was simply the flag of Milan. For many decades no club logo was displayed, with the exception of the devil's logo in the early 1980s. The club badge made its definitive appearance on the match strips in the 1995–96, in a form that remained basically unchanged until present days. Since its foundation, the AC Milan home kit consisted of a red and black striped shirt, combined with white shorts and black socks; over the course of the decades, only cyclical changes dictated by the fashions of the time affected this pattern, which remained almost unchanged up to present days. In the first decade of the 20th century, the Rossoneri's first kit was a simple silk shirt characterized by thin stripes, with the badge of the city of Milan sewn at heart level. From the 1910s, the stripes were enlarged following a pattern that would remain unchanged until the late 1950s. The 1960s marked a return to the origins, with the use of thin stripes. This style would last until the 1985–86 season, with a small intermezzo from 1980 to 1982, when the stripes changed to a middle size again. A notable innovation occurred in this period. Between the 1979–80 and 1980–81 seasons, the AC Milan shirt achieved an important record by adding the surnames of the players above the number for the first time in Italian football.[74] From the 1986–87 season, under the impulse of the new club owner Silvio Berlusconi, the stripes were brought back to a middle size, and the colour of the socks was changed to white, taking the same colour of the shorts. In such a way, Berlusconi aimed at giving the players a more elegant look, as well as making the kit more distinguishably red and black when watched on the television compared to the thin striped kit, which, at a distance and on the television, could mistaken for a full red or brown shirt.[75] This style continued until 1998. Starting from the 1998–99 season, the kits started to be modified on a yearly basis in their design. Milan's away kit has always been completely white, sometimes adorned with various types of decorations, the most common of which are one vertical or horizontal red and black stripe.[76] The white away kit is considered by both the fans and the club to be a lucky strip in Champions League finals, due to the fact that Milan has won six finals out of eight in an all white strip (losing only to Ajax in 1995 and Liverpool in 2005), and only won one out of three in the home strip. The third strip, which is rarely used, changes yearly, being mostly black with red trimmings. \"I can't think of many shirts out there that are as recognisable as Milan's. – Our kits go beyond just the sphere of football.\" \"AC Milan Anthem – Milan Milan\" debuted in 1988 and was composed by Tony Renis and Massimo Guantini.[83][84] The official mascot, designed by Warner Bros., is \"Milanello\", a red devil with the AC Milan kit and a ball.[citation needed] Milan played their first matches at the Trotter pitch, located where the Milan Central railway station would later be built. It could not be defined as a stadium, as there were no dressing rooms, no stands and no other facilities. In 1903, Milan moved to the Acquabella pitch, where the stands consisted of a section of ground raised for the purpose. Milan played there until 1905. The following year the club moved to the Porta Monforte pitch, where they played until 1914. The stadium was furnished with a ticket office and wooden stands. In the following years Milan played at the Velodromo Sempione from 1914 to 1920, and at the Viale Lombardia stadium from 1920 to 1926. The latter was a modern structure, with a big main stand and which hosted several games of the Italy national football team.[85] In 1926 Milan moved to the stadium where they still play nowadays: The San Siro. The stadium,[9] officially known as Stadio Giuseppe Meazza after the former player who represented both Milan and Internazionale, has 75,923 seats. The more commonly used name, \"San Siro\", is the name of the district where it is located. San Siro was privately built by funding from Milan's president at the time, Piero Pirelli. Construction was performed by 120 workers, and took 13+1⁄2 months to complete. The stadium was owned by the club until it was sold to the city in 1935, and since 1947 it has been shared with Internazionale when the other major Milanese club was accepted as joint tenant. The first game played at the stadium was on 19 September 1926, when Milan lost 6–3 in a friendly match against Internazionale. Milan played its first league game in San Siro on 19 September 1926, losing 1–2 to Sampierdarenese. From an initial capacity of 35,000 spectators, the stadium has undergone several major renovations, most recently in preparation for the 1990 FIFA World Cup when its capacity was set to 85,700, all covered with a polycarbonate roof. In the summer of 2008 its capacity was reduced to 80,018, to meet the new standards set by UEFA. Based on the English model for stadiums, San Siro is specifically designed for football matches, as opposed to many multi-purpose stadiums used in Serie A. It is therefore renowned in Italy for its fantastic atmosphere during matches, largely thanks to the closeness of the stands to the pitch. The frequent use of flares by supporters contributes to the atmosphere but the practice has occasionally caused problems. On 19 December 2005, Milan vice-president and executive director Adriano Galliani announced that the club was seriously working towards a relocation. He stated Milan's new stadium will be largely based on the Veltins-Arena – the home of Schalke 04 in Gelsenkirchen – and will follow the standards of football stadiums in the United States, Germany and Spain. As opposed to many other stadiums in Italy, Milan's new stadium would likely be used for football only, having no athletics track. On 11 December 2014, Barbara Berlusconi announced a proposal to build a property stadium of 42,000 seats in Portello, behind the new HQ of the Rossoneri, and the large square \"Piazza Gino Valle\". The new village with shopping malls and hotel is located near CityLife district and is served by the metro.[86] On 20 September 2015, however, Silvio Berlusconi called an end to his club's plans to build a new stadium in the city.[87] In 2017, new CEO Marco Fassone stated that the club may look at either staying in the San Siro or moving to a new stadium with the club hierarchy emphasising the need to increase average attendance for home games.[88] On 27 September 2023, chairman Paolo Scaroni announced the club had filed a proposal to build a new 70,000-seater stadium, alongside the club headquarters and museum in the comune of San Donato Milanese, a suburb south of Milan.[89] Milan is one of the most supported football clubs in Italy, according to research conducted by Italian newspaper La Repubblica.[90] Historically, Milan was supported by the city's working class, which granted them the nickname of casciavid [kaʃaˈʋiːt] (which in Milanese dialect means \"screwdrivers\"), used until the 1960s.[91] On the other hand, crosstown rivals Inter Milan were mainly supported by the more prosperous middle class.[91] The oldest ultras groups in all of Italian football, Fossa dei Leoni, originated in Milan.[92] Currently, the main ultras group within the support base is Brigate Rossonere.[92] Milan ultras have never had any particular political preference,[92] but the media traditionally associated them with the left wing[93] until recently, when Berlusconi's presidency somewhat altered that view.[94] According to a study from 2010, Milan is the most supported Italian team in Europe and seventh overall, with over 18.4 million fans.[95] It had the thirteenth highest average attendance of European football clubs during the 2019–20 season, behind Borussia Dortmund, Bayern Munich, Manchester United, Barcelona, Real Madrid, Inter, Schalke 04, Tottenham Hotspur, Celtic, Atlético Madrid, West Ham United and Arsenal.[96] Milan's main rivalry is with its neighbour club, Inter Milan. Both clubs meet in the widely anticipated Derby della Madonnina twice every Serie A season. The name of the derby refers to the Blessed Virgin Mary, whose statue atop the Milan Cathedral is one of the city's main attractions. The first match was held in the final of the Chiasso Cup of 1908, a football tournament played in Canton Ticino, Switzerland, on 18 October of that year; the Rossoneri won 2–1.[97] The rivalry reached its highest point in the 1960s, when the two clubs dominated the scene both domestically and internationally. In Italy they cumulatively won five Serie A titles, while internationally they collected four European cups. On the bench it showcased the clash of two different approaches to Catenaccio by the two managers: Nereo Rocco for Milan and Helenio Herrera for Inter. On the pitch the stage was taken by some of the biggest stars the Italian Serie A could offer: players such as Gianni Rivera, Giovanni Trapattoni and José Altafini for Milan and Sandro Mazzola, Giacinto Facchetti and Luis Suárez for Inter. The match usually creates a lively atmosphere, with numerous (often humorous or offensive) banners unfolded before the start of the game. Flares are commonly present and contribute to the spectacle but they have occasionally led to problems, including the abandonment of the second leg of the 2004–05 Champions League quarter-final match between Milan and Inter on 12 April 2005, after a flare thrown from the crowd by an Inter supporter struck Milan goalkeeper Dida on the shoulder.[98] The rivalry with Juventus F.C. is a rivalry between the two most titled teams in Italy. The challenge confronts also two of the clubs with the greater basin of supporters as well as those with the greatest turnover and stock market value in the country.[99] Milan and Juventus were often fighting for the top positions of the Serie A standings. Some important periods marked by this rivalry were the early 1950s, which saw the two teams alternating each other as Serie A champions (the two clubs won seven titles in the decade), and big duels between forwards, with the Swedish Gre-No-Li on the rossoneri side and the trio formed by Giampiero Boniperti, John Hansen and Karl Aage Præst on the bianconeri side; the early 1970s, when for two consecutive seasons, 1971-72 and 1972-73, Milan lost the scudetto to Juventus by just one point; the 1990s, when the two clubs dominated the league by winning eight (consecutive) titles out of ten, lining up players that marked the history of football in their era and in the whole history; and finally in the 2000s, when, between the 2004-05 and 2005-06 seasons, the two clubs contested each other the Serie A titles, both won by Juventus but then revoked due to the Calciopoli scandal. The only match played by the two teams in European competitions was the 2003 UEFA Champions League final, the first such final between two Italian clubs, won by Milan at the penalties, which granted Milan the sixth Champions League title of their history.[100] The rivalry with Genoa started at the dawn of the 20th century, when the two clubs repeatedly faced each other for the Italian championship and other important trophies of the time. It then continued in the 1981-82 Serie A season, when Genoa avoided relegation in Naples just a few minutes from the final whistle of the last game of the season condemning the Rossoneri to the second Serie B season of their history. The rivalry worsened in 1995 after Genoa fan Vincenzo Spagnolo was stabbed to death by a Milan supporter.[101] Milan also have rivalries with Fiorentina, Atalanta and Napoli. In the movie industry, among the films dedicated to the Rossoneri team is Sunday Heroes (1953), by director Mario Camerini, in which the main plot pivots around a fictional football match between the Rossoneri and a club on the brink of relegation. In the film appear, in addition to the coach Lajos Czeizler, many of the Milan players of the time, including Lorenzo Buffon, Carlo Annovazzi and the entire Gre-No-Li trio.[citation needed] Milan as a fan base and some of their most popular players appeared in several Italian comedy movies. Among them the following are worth mentioning: Eccezzziunale... veramente, Really SSSupercool: Chapter Two (whose cast includes Paolo Maldini, Gennaro Gattuso, Massimo Ambrosini, Dida, Andriy Shevchenko and Alessandro Costacurta) and Tifosi (whose cast includes Franco Baresi).[citation needed] On 16 December 1999, on the day of the centenary of the club's foundation, Milan Channel was launched. The subscription-based television channel broadcasts news, events and vintage matches of the club. It is the first Italian thematic channel entirely dedicated to a football team. On 1 July 2016, the channel took on the new name of Milan TV, renewing its graphics and logo.[citation needed] In the editorial field, Forza Milan! was the official magazine of the club for over half a century. It was founded in 1963 by journalist Gino Sansoni and published by Panini. Issued with a monthly cadence, it covered all events surrounding Milan, with interviews to its protagonists, special posters, reports of official and friendly matches. Under the direction of Gigi Vesigna it reached a monthly circulation of 130,000 copies. The last issue of the magazine was published in June 2018.[102] With a total of 31 domestic honours, Milan is one of the most successful clubs in Italy. The club won its first Serie A title in 1901 with its most recent coming in 2022. Milan's tenth scudetto win meant that it earned the right to place a star on its jersey in recognition of this. Milan is the most successful Italian club in international football with 20 major international trophies won (18 of them organised by UEFA and FIFA), and the third most successful in Europe overall after Real Madrid and Barcelona. They have won the European Cup/Champions League seven times, an Italian record and only surpassed by Real Madrid, with their most recent coming in 2007. Milan's fifth European Cup win, in 1994, meant that the club was awarded the trophy permanently and is allowed to display a multiple-winner badge on its shirt.[103] The club also holds a joint record of two wins in the Latin Cup and a joint record of three wins in the Intercontinental Cup. In 2007, Milan won the FIFA Club World Cup for the first time, completing an international treble of Champions League, Super Cup and Club World Cup. Paolo Maldini holds the records for both total appearances and Serie A appearances for Milan, with 902 official games played in total and 647 in Serie A (as of 31 May 2009, not including playoff matches),[104] the latter being an all-time Serie A record.[105] Swedish forward Gunnar Nordahl scored 38 goals in the 1950–51 season, 35 of which were in Serie A, setting an Italian football and club record. He went on to become Milan's all-time top goalscorer, scoring 221 goals for the club in 268 games.[106] He is followed in second place by Andriy Shevchenko with 175 goals in 322 games, and Gianni Rivera in third place, who has scored 164 goals in 658 games. Rivera is also Milan's youngest ever goalscorer, scoring in a league match against Juventus at just 17 years. Legendary tactician Nereo Rocco, the first proponent of catenaccio in the country, was Milan's longest-serving manager, sitting on the bench for over nine years (in two spells) in the 1960s and early 1970s, winning the club's first European Cup triumphs. Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who purchased the club in 1986, is Milan's longest-serving president (23 years, due to a two-year vacancy between 2004 and 2006). The first official match in which Milan participated was in the Third Federal Football Championship, the predecessor of Serie A, losing 3–0 to Torinese. Milan's largest ever victory was 13–0 against Audax Modena, in a league match at the 1914–15 season. Its heaviest defeat was recorded in the league at the 1922–23 season, beaten 0–8 by Bologna. During the 1991–92 season, the club achieved the feature of being the first team to win the Serie A title without losing a single game. Previously, only Perugia had managed to go unbeaten over an entire Serie A season (1978–79), but finished second in the table. In total, Milan's unbeaten streak lasted 58 games, starting with a 0–0 draw against Parma on 26 May 1991 and coincidentally ending with a 1–0 home loss to Parma on 21 March 1993. This is a Serie A record as well as the third-longest unbeaten run in top flight European football, coming in behind Steaua București's record of 104 unbeaten games and Celtic's 68 game unbeaten run.[13][107] Since 2007, along with Boca Juniors, Milan has won more FIFA recognised international club titles than any other club in the world with 18 titles.[108] They were overtaken by Al Ahly SC from Egypt after their 2014 CAF Confederation Cup win.[109] The sale of Kaká to Real Madrid in 2009 broke the eight-year-old world football transfer record held by Zinedine Zidane, costing the Spanish club €67 million[110] (about £56 million[111]). That record, however, lasted for less than a month, broken by Cristiano Ronaldo's £80 million transfer.[112] This record, however, is in terms of nominal British pound rates, not adjusted to inflation or the real value of the euro. Madrid bought Zidane for €77.5 million in 2001,[113][114] about £46 million at that time. Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules; some limited exceptions apply.

Here is a complete list of them.[128] Below is a list of Milan managers from 1900 until the present day.[129] On 13 April 2017 Milan became a subsidiary of Rossoneri Sport Investment Luxembourg, which acquired 99.9% shares of AC Milan S.p.A. from Fininvest. Li Yonghong became the new chairman[nb 4] and Marco Fassone was confirmed as CEO.[130][131] Li Yonghong's investment vehicle was removed as the shareholder of Rossoneri Sport Investment Luxembourg after defaulting to Elliott Management Corporation, which lent a large sum of money to Li to finalise the acquisition.[132][133] Other partners of Elliott were Arena Investors[133] and Blue Skye, according to news reports.[134] Elliott nominated a new board of directors for both Rossoneri Sport Investment Luxembourg and Milan, with Paolo Scaroni as the new chairman (Italian: presidente) of the board of Milan. The four previous Chinese member of the board and former CEO Marco Fassone were all dismissed.[135] According to The Football Money League published by consultants Deloitte, in the 2005–06 season, Milan was the fifth-highest earning football club in the world with an estimated revenue of €233.7 million.[136] However, it fell to twelfth in 2013–14 season. The club is also ranked as the eighth-wealthiest football club in the world by Forbes magazine as of 2014[update], making it the wealthiest in Italian football, just surpassing ninth-ranked Juventus by a narrow margin.[20] Emirates is the current main sponsor for Milan's shirt starting from the 2010–11 season and through to the 2019–20 season.[137] Previously, German car manufacturer Opel (owned by General Motors) had sponsored Milan for 12 seasons.[138] For most of those 12 years, \"Opel\" was displayed on the front of the shirt, but in the 2003–04 and the 2005–06 seasons respectively, \"Meriva\" and \"Zafira\" (two cars from the company's range) were displayed. The current shirts are supplied by Puma. Previously it was supplied by German sportswear manufacturer Adidas, whose deal was scheduled to run until 2023.[139] The deal made Adidas the official manufacturer of all kits, training equipment and replica outfits. However, an early termination of the deal was announced in October 2017,[140] effective on 30 June 2018. Prior to Adidas, the Italian sports company Lotto produced Milan's sportswear. As a consequence of the aggregate 2.5-year financial result in the reporting periods ending at 31 December 2015, 31 December 2016 and 30 June 2017 (a FFP-adjusted net loss of €146 million, €121 million in excess of the acceptable deviation in the regulation[141]: 9 ), Milan was initially banned from European competitions due to breach in UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations. However, the European ban was lifted by an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.[141] Milan was allowed to achieve the break even condition on or before 30 June 2021.[142] Note: Re-capitalization figures were obtained from item versamenti soci in conto capitale e/o copertura perdite, for 2006 to 2017 financial year Milan took part in three editions of the Superleague Formula, from 2008 to 2010. This car competition involved the participation of professional racing teams sponsored by international football teams. The Rossoneri supported the Dutch team Scuderia Playteam in the first season, then Azerti Motorsport in 2009 and the Atech Grand Prix in 2010. The team took several victories and pole positions, and finished third in the final standings of the 2008 championship with Robert Doornbos, former Minardi and Red Bull driver in the Formula 1 World Championship, as main driver.[169] In the same year, Doornbos achieved his team's first victory at the Nürburgring circuit in Germany. Giorgio Pantano drove for Milan in the 2009 season and he has also won races for the team.[170]",

They both share the same stadium, meaning home and away in this tie is played in rather familiar territory. The first game handed the advantage to Inter, but a two-goal deficit is not beyond the reach of their neighbourly rivals AC Milan. **Follow Inter vs AC Milan in the Champions League semi-final live** The history of AC Milan is a storied one, and the club owes its nomenclature to its English roots as well as a touch of historical circumstance, one very much linked to that of their rivals. Ahead of the game, I thought I’d delve into the tale behind the name of this iconic football institution. 💸🇮🇹 Inter take on their city rivals Milan at San Siro tonight, and they will do so without a ludicrously expensive sponsor on their shirt - but why?Before you ask, I'm not complaining, it makes their shirt look even more fabulous...https://t.co/9UnMXVBbTn Back in 1899, an English expatriate named Herbert Kilpin set the wheels in motion to establish a club in Milan. Originally known as Milan Foot-Ball and Cricket Club, this ambitious venture would lay the foundation for greatness. While the club claims December 16 as its official founding date, historical evidence points toward a more probable inception on December 13, a few days earlier. Interestingly, AC Milan’s (Associazione Calcio Milan, translated to Milan Football Association) name carries a subtle nod to its English heritage. In an era when the club faced external pressures to conform to the Italian spelling of the city, Milano, it defiantly held onto its English roots. Despite the imposition during the fascist regime, the club retained the unique spelling that harkened back to its inception. It became a symbol of defiance, a constant reminder of the enduring spirit of the team. The Derby della Madonnina: History and origin Why is Inter vs AC Milan called the Derby della Madoninna? Inter's sponsor-less jersey explained The early years saw AC Milan establish themselves as a force to be reckoned with. In the first decade of existence, the club secured several prestigious trophies, including the Medaglia del Re (King’s Medal), the Palla Dapples, and the FGNI tournament. These triumphs were testament to the team’s prowess and set the stage for a remarkable journey. However, the road to success had its bumps along the way. In 1908, internal disagreements over the signing of foreign players led to a dramatic split within the club. Out of this division emerged another Milan-based team, F.C. Internazionale Milano, giving birth to one of football’s most intense rivalries. This separation marked a challenging period for AC Milan, with an elusive domestic title remaining out of reach until the 1950–51 season.

Glory was soon to return either side of the turn of the new century. Today, AC Milan has recaptured some of its magic and after lifting the Serie A title in 2022, now aims to add Champions League glory. Its name reflects the amalgamation of cultures, an English spelling that proudly defies conformity, and an Italian soul that beats within. Through triumphs and setbacks, AC Milan has remained a testament to the power of passion, unity, and the indomitable spirit of the Beautiful Game.

                "title": "History of the AC Milan | AC Milan",
                "content": "“We will be a team of devils. Our colours will be red like fire and black to invoke fear in our opponents!” These were the words that Herbert Kilpin used as he founded AC Milan on 16 December 1899. Just a year and a half later, the Rossoneri became the champions of Italy for the first time after beating Genoa 3-0 at Ponte Carrega on 5 May 1901. The first celebration took place at AC Milan's first headquarters, the Fiaschetteria Toscana on Via Berchet in Milan, in 1899. Words, places and dates that gave rise to the Rossoneri’s glorious history. This is a Club that has contributed hugely to the world of football, so much so that AC Milan held the most international titles recognised by FIFA from December 2007 to February 2014. The Rossoneri’s history is now the stuff of legend, as are the men who have helped to write it – be they presidents, coaches or footballers. There have been so many historic figures, from the Englishman Alfred Edwards, under whom the Club won its first league title, and Andrea Rizzoli, the first President of AC Milan and an Italian team to win the European Cup in 1963 at Wembley, through to Silvio Berlusconi, the President who had the most success in Italy, Europe and throughout the world. It is also possible to recognise a great club through its playing culture in particular, by the style it promotes, by the way it carries itself, by the innovative drive given to it by its leaders. It’s no coincidence that various Rossoneri victories over various eras and different decades have brought about new visions about how football should be played. And those sitting on the AC Milan bench have been key to this: the greatest coaches of Italian football have all taken charge of the Rossoneri. Gipo Viani, Nereo Rocco and Nils Liedholm paved the way for Arrigo Sacchi, Fabio Capello and Carlo Ancelotti, the latter trio inheriting incredible legacies while looking to play a modern, spectacular brand of football. During the historic years under Berlusconi's presidency, Arrigo Sacchi was hugely successful and innovated not only thanks to great players, but also thanks to what could be considered as an extra man: the Game he played. Fabio Capello then took over, providing continuity as the winning culture continued. Under Sacchi, AC Milan won one Scudetto, two European Cups, two European Super Cups and two Intercontinental Cups, winning all the international finals they were involved in. And it was that extra man, the Game, that brought the best out of individuals and led to three Rossoneri players occupying the top three places in the Ballon d’Or in 1988 (Van Basten, Gullit and Rijkaard) and 1989 (Van Basten, Baresi and Rijkaard). Under Capello, AC Milan were the dominant team in Italy, winning four Scudetti in five seasons. However, success wasn't just limited to what they did at home, the team also remained a force to be reckoned with in Europe. The Rossoneri made it to three consecutive Champions League finals between 1993 and 1995, with the 1994 success in Athens against Barcelona being voted as the ‘Match of the Century' by AC Milan fans in the Club’s Centenary referendum. Such was the strength of the Rossoneri with Don Fabio at the helm, the team went 58 games unbeaten between May 1991 and March 1993, while Sebastiano Rossi went 929 minutes without conceding a goal during the 1993/94 season. Furthermore, the Diavolo won three league titles between 1992 and 1994 without being given a single penalty. Following Capello’s tenure, and after the Scudetto title won by Alberto Zaccheroni in his first season at the Club and Fatih Terim’s brief spell, the mantle was passed on to Carlo Ancelotti, with the Italian looking to emulate the success of the \"Immortals\" (of Arrigo Sacchi), of which he was a part, and the \"Invincibles\" of Fabio Capello. With King Carlo at the helm, more space had to be cleared in the Rossoneri’s trophy cabinet. In five seasons, Ancelotti won two Champions League titles, also reaching the final, semi-finals and quarter-finals in three other European campaigns. In the 2009/10 season, Coach Ancelotti was replaced by Leonardo. He remained AC Milan Coach for a year after having spent 13 years at the Club, initially as a player, then as a director as part of AC Milan's charity Fondazione Milan and also the technical sector. After Leonardo came Massimiliano Allegri, who had a fantastic team at his disposal for the 2010/11 season thanks to Ibrahimovic, Robinho and Boateng joining the Club in August 2010 and further reinforcements being added in January 2011. Under Coach Allegri, AC Milan won their 18th Scudetto and sixth Supercoppa Italiana, the latter of which was won against Inter in August 2011 at the Bird’s Nest in Beijing. After a further two and a half seasons, during which AC Milan finished second and third in Serie A, Clarence Seedorf took over the managerial hot-seat, another man who had previously shone in the Rossoneri shirt. Under Seedorf’s guidance, AC Milan picked up 35 points over the course of the second half of the 2013-2014 season. After previously scoring in all three of the Rossoneri’s 2007 finals against Liverpool, Sevilla and Boca Juniors, Filippo Inzaghi took charge of the First Team in 2014/15. Prior to this, he'd led the Primavera to Viareggio Cup success in February 2014. As for 2015/16, Sinisa Mihajlovic started the season in charge and guided the team to the Coppa Italia final before Cristian Brocchi was promoted from the Primavera to replace him by the end of the season. Come 2016/17, the Club's hierarchy once again wanted to turn the page, duly appointing Vincenzo Montella as the Rossoneri's new Coach. He subsequently guided the Rossoneri to Supercoppa Italiana success against Juventus on 23 December 2016 as Milan beat Juventus on penalties in Doha. Rino Gattuso was the next man to take the reins on 27 November 2017 – already a Rossoneri icon after winning 10 trophies with AC Milan from 2002 to 2011 (five in Italy and five on the international stage). The former Rossoneri midfielder guided the club to the Coppa Italia final and also ensured qualification to the Europa League on two separate occasions. The relationship between Gattuso and Casa Milan – which became the Rossoneri's new Headquarters at the start of the 2013/14 campaign – ended mutually in May 2019. From that moment on, the choice for the new Head Coach, guided by the sporting management represented by Zvonimir Boban and Paolo Maldini, was Marco Giampolo. His first game in the dugout for the Rossoneri came in the International Champions Cup during the summer of 2019, the season in which the Club celebrated its 120th anniversary. Our league campaign then got off to a slow start, and after three consecutive defeats to Inter, Torino and Fiorentina as well as a struggle to implement his new footballing philosophy, Marco Giampaolo left the Club. Stefano Pioli took over in his stead and did an excellent job in reforging the group and giving it a clear identity. Starting in June 2020, following the lockdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the Rossoneri put together an important winning streak and managed to beat almost every opponent. The 2020/21 season was a rebirth for the Club, with the team performing extremely well in the league. AC Milan finished second on 79 points, having won 24 matches and qualified for the Champions League for the first time in seven years. The high point of 2021/22 was winning Serie A, the perfect prize for an ambitious project. First place, 86 points, 26 wins and 69 goals scored are just some of the numbers that contributed to AC Milan winning their 19th Scudetto. In 2022/23, despite being unable to retain the Scudetto, the Rossoneri continued to make strides forward, reaching the Champions League semi-finals for the first time in 16 years. 2023/24 ended with a second-place finish in the league, earning qualification to the Champions League and also the Supercoppa Italiana. The European campaign started off in the Champions League but, after finishing third in the group stages behind PSG and Borussia Dortmund, carried on in the Europa League, getting knocked out in the quarter-finals against Roma. At the end of the season, the Club and Stefano Pioli parted ways. On 13 June 2024, Paulo Fonseca was announced as the new head coach, the first Portuguese to be in the Rossoneri hotseat. The former Lille Coach's adventure only lasted a few months. On 30 December 2024, Sergio Conceição began his AC Milan adventure. Copyright © 2020 ACMilan.com. All rights reserved.
