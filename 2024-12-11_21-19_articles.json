                "content": "Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (Spanish pronunciation: [reˈal maˈðɾið ˈkluβ ðe ˈfuðβol] ⓘ), commonly referred to as Real Madrid, is a Spanish professional football club based in Madrid. The club competes in La Liga, the top tier of Spanish football. Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since its inception. The honorific title real is Spanish for \"royal\" and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 alongside with the crown in the club crest. Real Madrid have played their home matches in the 85,000-capacity Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting clubs, Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout its history. The official Madrid anthem is the \"Hala Madrid y nada más\", written by RedOne and Manuel Jabois.[8] The club is one of the most widely supported in the world and is the most followed football club on social media according to the CIES Football Observatory as of 2023.[9][10] It was estimated to be worth $6.6 billion in 2024, making it the world's most valuable football club.[11] In 2024, Real Madrid become the first football club to make €1 billion ($1.08bn) in revenue according to the club's announcement.[12] In domestic football, the club has won 71 trophies; a record 36 La Liga titles, 20 Copa del Rey, 13 Supercopa de España, a Copa Eva Duarte and a Copa de la Liga.[13] In International football, Real Madrid have won a record 34 trophies: a record 15 European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, a record six UEFA Super Cups, two UEFA Cups, a joint record two Latin Cups, a record one Iberoamerican Cup, and a record eight FIFA Club World championships.[note 1] Madrid was ranked first in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 2000, 2002, 2014, 2017.[17] In UEFA, Madrid ranks first in the all-time club ranking.[18][19] Being one of the three founding members of La Liga that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929 (along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona), Real Madrid has many long-standing rivalries, most notably El Clásico with Barcelona and El Derbi Madrileño with Atlético Madrid. The club established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s and 60s, winning five consecutive and six overall European Cups and reaching a further two finals. This success was replicated on the domestic front, with Madrid winning 12 league titles in 16 years. This team, which included Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás, Paco Gento and Raymond Kopa is considered, by some in the sport, to be the greatest of all time.[20][21] Real Madrid is known for its Galácticos policy, which involves signing the world's best players, such as Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane and David Beckham to create a superstar team.[22] The term 'Galácticos policy' generally refers to the two eras of Florentino Pérez's presidency of the club (2000–2006 and 2009–2018); however, players brought in just before his tenure are sometimes considered to be part of the Galácticos legacy. A notable example is Steve McManaman, who like many other players also succeeded under the policy.[23] On 26 June 2009, Madrid signed Cristiano Ronaldo for a record-breaking £80 million (€94 million);[24] he became both the club's and history's all-time top goalscorer.[25][26][27][28] Madrid have recently relaxed the Galácticos policy, instead focusing on signing young talents such as Vinícius Júnior, Rodrygo, Jude Bellingham[29] and Kylian Mbappé.[30][31] Real Madrid is recognised as the greatest football club of the 20th century by FIFA and as the best European club during the same timeframe by the IFFHS,[32] while also receiving the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit in 2004.[33] Real Madrid has the highest participations in the European Cup/Champions League (43),[18] a tournament in which they hold the overall record for the most wins, most draws and most goals scored.[34] Real Madrid is the only club to have won three consecutive titles (three-peat) in the European Cup/Champions League twice, first in 1955–56, 1956–57, and 1957–58, and second in 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18. In June 2024, they won a record-extending 15th Champions League title (the fifth in nine seasons), recognised as such by Guinness World Records.[35] Real Madrid is the first club across all of Europe's top-five leagues to win 100 trophies in all competitions.[36] As of July 2024,[update] Real Madrid are ranked 2nd in the UEFA club rankings and first in last 10 years (2013–2023) overall.[37][38] Real Madrid's origins go back to when football was introduced to Madrid by the academics and students of the Institución Libre de Enseñanza, which included several Cambridge and Oxford University graduates.[39] They founded (Sociedad) Sky Football in 1897, commonly known as La Sociedad (The Society) as it was the only one based in Madrid, playing on Sunday mornings at Moncloa. In 1900, conflict between members caused some of them to leave and create a new club, Nueva Sociedad de Football (New Society of Football), to distinguish themselves from Sky Football. Among the dissenters were Julián Palacios, recognized as the first Real Madrid president, Juan Padrós and Carlos Padrós, the latter two being brothers and future presidents of Real Madrid. In 1901, this new club was renamed as Madrid Football Club. Later, following a restructuring in 1902, Sky was renamed as \"New Foot-Ball Club\".[40][41][42] On 6 March 1902, after a new Board presided by Juan Padrós had been elected, Madrid Football Club was officially founded.[7] The Padrós brothers summoned other football enthusiasts to a meeting in the back room of Al Capricho, the family business. They viewed football as a mass sport that should be accessible to representatives of all social classes, and thought the new club should embody that idea. The brothers proposed the name, Madrid Football Club, which was unanimously accepted. The membership fee was also set, two pesetas a month, and the color of the shirt was chosen to be white in honour of a famous English team Corinthian, which Juan Padrós had met on one of his trips.[43][44] Three years after its founding, in 1905, Madrid FC won its first title after defeating Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Cup final. The club became one of the founding sides of the Royal Spanish Football Federation on 4 January 1909, when club president Adolfo Meléndez signed the foundation agreement of the Spanish FA. After moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912.[45] In 1920, the club's name was changed to Real Madrid after King Alfonso XIII granted the title of Real (Royal) to the club.[46] In 1929, the first Spanish football league was founded. Real Madrid led the first league season until the last match, a loss to Athletic Bilbao, meant they finished runners-up to Barcelona.[47] Real Madrid won its first league title in the 1931–32 season and retained it the following year.[48] On 14 April 1931, the arrival of the Second Spanish Republic caused the club to lose the title Real and the royal crown on its emblem, going back to being named Madrid Football Club until the end of the Spanish Civil War. Football continued during the Second World War, and on 13 June 1943, Madrid beat Barcelona 11–1 in the second leg of the Copa del Generalísimo semi-finals, the Spanish Cup having been renamed in honour of General Franco.[note 2][49] The first leg, played at the Les Corts in Catalonia, had ended with Barcelona winning 3–0. Madrid complained about all the three goals that referee Fombona Fernández had allowed for Barcelona,[50] with the home supporters also whistling Madrid throughout, whom they accused of employing roughhouse tactics, and Fombona for allowing them to. The newspaper Ya reported the whistling as a \"clear intention to attack the representatives of Spain.\"[51] Barcelona fans were banned from traveling to Madrid. The day of the second leg, the Barcelona team were insulted and stones were thrown at their bus as soon as they left their hotel. Barcelona's striker Mariano Gonzalvo said of the incident, \"Five minutes before the game had started, our penalty area was already full of coins.\" Barcelona goalkeeper Luis Miró rarely approached his line—when he did, he was armed with stones. As Francisco Calvet told the story, \"They were shouting: Reds! Separatists!... a bottle just missed Sospedra that would have killed him if it had hit him. It was all set up.\"[52] Real Madrid went 2–0 up within half an hour. The third goal brought with it a sending off for Barcelona's Benito García after he made what Calvet claimed was a \"completely normal tackle\". Madrid's José Llopis Corona recalled: \"At which point, they got a bit demoralized,\" while Ángel Mur countered, \"at which point, we thought: 'go on then, score as many as you want'.\"[53] Madrid made it 8–0 by half-time; two goals were also ruled out for offside, and proceeded to score a further three goals in the second half, to which Barcelona replied with a late consolation goal.[54] According to football writer Sid Lowe, \"There have been relatively few mentions of the game [since] and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid. Indeed, the 11–1 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelona's history. This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims.\"[50] Fernando Argila, Barcelona's reserve goalkeeper from the 1943 match, said: \"There was no rivalry. Not, at least, until that game.\"[55] Santiago Bernabéu became president of Real Madrid in 1943.[56] Under his presidency, the club was rebuilt after the Civil War, and he oversaw the construction of the club's current stadium, Estadio Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (now known as the Santiago Bernabéu), and its training facilities Ciudad Deportiva. Additionally, during the 1950s former Real Madrid Amateurs player Miguel Malbo founded Real Madrid's youth academy, or \"cantera,\" known today as La Fábrica. Beginning in 1953, he embarked upon a strategy of signing world-class players from abroad, the most prominent being Alfredo Di Stéfano.[57] In 1955, acting upon the idea proposed by Gabriel Hanot, a French sports journalist and editor of L'Équipe, Bernabéu, Ernest Bedrignan (deputy chairman of the Ligue de Football Professionnel)[58] and Gusztáv Sebes created the European Cup, a continental tournament for the league champions around Europe, which is today known as the UEFA Champions League.[59] It was under Bernabéu's guidance that Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football. The club won the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included the 7–3 Hampden Park final against Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960.[57] After these five consecutive successes, Real was permanently awarded the original cup and earned the right to wear the UEFA badge of honour.[60] Real Madrid's achievements in Europe were built upon its unprecedented domestic dominance, with the club winning twelve league titles out of sixteen possible from 1953–54 to 1968–69, including a five-in-a-row sequence in 1961–65, and finishing runners-up a further three times.[61] The club won the European Cup for a sixth time in 1966, defeating Partizan Belgrade 2–1 in the final with a team composed entirely of same nationality players, a first in the competition.[62] This team became known as the Yé-yé. The name \"Yé-yé\" came from the \"Yeah, yeah, yeah\" chorus in The Beatles' song \"She Loves You\" after four members of the team posed for Marca and impersonated the Beatles.[63] The Yé-yé generation was also European Cup runners-up in 1962[64] and 1964.[62] In the 1970s, Real Madrid won six league championships and three Spanish Cups.[65] The club competed in its first European Cup Winners' Cup in 1970–71 and progressed all the way to the final, where it lost to English side Chelsea 2–1 in a replay.[66] On 2 July 1978, club president Santiago Bernabéu died while the World Cup was being played in Argentina. FIFA decreed three days of mourning to honour him during the tournament.[67] The following year, the club organized the first edition of the Trofeo Santiago Bernabéu in memory of its former president. Bernabéu had been Real Madrid's president for almost 35 years, during which his club won one Intercontinental Cup, six European Cups, 16 league titles, six Spanish Cups, two Latin Cups and one Copa Eva Duarte.[68] In the early 1980s, Real Madrid had lost its grasp on the La Liga title, until a new cohort of home-grown stars brought domestic success back to the club.[69][70] Spanish sports journalist Julio César Iglesias gave to this generation the name La Quinta del Buitre (\"Vulture's Cohort\"), which was derived from the nickname given to one of its members, Emilio Butragueño. The other four members were Manolo Sanchís, Martín Vázquez, Míchel and Miguel Pardeza. All five footballers were graduates of Real Madrid's youth academy.[69][70] With La Quinta del Buitre (reduced to four members when Pardeza left for Zaragoza in 1986) and notable players like goalkeeper Francisco Buyo, right-back Miguel Porlán Chendo and Mexican striker Hugo Sánchez, Real Madrid had one of the best teams in Spain and Europe during the second half of the 1980s, winning two UEFA Cups, five Spanish championships in a row, one Spanish Cup, and three Spanish Super Cups.[69][70] In the early 1990s, La Quinta del Buitre split up after Martín Vázquez, Emilio Butragueño and Míchel left the club. In 1996, President Lorenzo Sanz appointed Fabio Capello as coach.[71] Although his tenure lasted only one season, Real Madrid were proclaimed league champions, and players like Predrag Mijatović, Davor Šuker, Clarence Seedorf, Roberto Carlos and keeper Bodo Illgner, arrived at the club to strengthen a squad that already boasted the likes of Raúl, Fernando Hierro and Fernando Redondo. As a result, Real Madrid (with the addition of Fernando Morientes in 1997) finally ended its 32-year wait for its seventh European Cup: in 1998, under manager Jupp Heynckes, they defeated Juventus 1–0 in the final with a goal from Mijatović.[72] In November 1999, Vicente del Bosque took over as coach. For the last season of the century, 1999–2000, the squad was still led by the older veterans such as Fernando Hierro, Fernando Redondo, Roberto Carlos and Raúl. Real added the budding young talents of Guti and Iker Casillas, supported by the arrival of Steve McManaman and Nicolas Anelka from the English Premier League, alongside local talents Míchel Salgado and Iván Helguera. In Del Bosque's first season in charge, Real won the Champions League for the eighth time, following a 3–0 victory over Valencia in the final, with goals from Morientes, McManaman and Raúl.[73] This victory marked the beginning of a successful period in Real Madrid's history.[74] In July 2000, Florentino Pérez was elected club president.[75] He vowed in his campaign to erase the club's €270 million debt and modernize the club's facilities. However, the primary electoral promise that propelled Pérez to victory was the signing of Luís Figo from arch-rivals Barcelona.[76] The following year, the club had its training ground rezoned and used the money to begin assembling the Galácticos team by signing a global star every summer, which included Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Luís Figo, David Beckham and Fabio Cannavaro.[77] It is debatable whether the gamble paid off, as despite winning the UEFA Champions League and an Intercontinental Cup in 2002, followed by La Liga in 2003, the club failed to win a major trophy for the next three seasons. Off the field, the Zidanes y Pavones policy resulted in increased financial success based on the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, particularly in Asia.[78] The few days after the capturing of the 2003 La Liga title were surrounded with controversy. The first controversial decision came when Pérez sacked winning coach Vicente del Bosque.[79] Over a dozen players left the club, including Madrid captain Fernando Hierro, while defensive midfielder Claude Makélélé refused to take part in training in protest at being one of the lowest-paid players at the club and subsequently moved to Chelsea.[80] \"That's a lot [of players leaving] when the normal rule is: never change a winning team,\" stated Zidane.[81] Real Madrid, with newly appointed coach Carlos Queiroz, started their domestic league slowly after a hard win over Real Betis.[81] The 2005–06 season began with the promise of several new signings: Júlio Baptista (€24 million), Robinho (€30 million), and Sergio Ramos (€27 million).[82] However, Real Madrid suffered from some poor results, including a 0–3 loss at the hands of Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu in November 2005.[83] Madrid's coach Wanderley Luxemburgo was sacked the following month and his replacement was Juan Ramón López Caro.[84] A brief return to form came to an abrupt halt after Madrid lost the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-finals 6–1 to Real Zaragoza,[85] a defeat that was nearly reversed with a 4–0 home victory. Shortly after, Real Madrid were eliminated from the Champions League for a fourth successive year, this time at the hands of Arsenal. On 27 February 2006, Florentino Pérez resigned.[86] Ramón Calderón was elected as club president on 2 July 2006 and subsequently appointed Fabio Capello as the new coach and Predrag Mijatović as the new sporting director. Real Madrid won the Liga title in 2007 for the first time in four years, but Capello was nonetheless sacked at the end of the campaign.[87] The title was won on 17 June, where Real faced Mallorca at the Bernabéu while Barcelona and Sevilla, the other title challengers, faced Gimnàstic de Tarragona and Villarreal, respectively. At half-time, Real were 0–1 down, while Barcelona had surged ahead into a 0–3 lead in Tarragona. However, three goals in the last half-hour secured Madrid a 3–1 win and their first league title since 2003.[88] Real Madrid repeated as league winners in 2007–08, but the following season ended up being one of the most disastrous in the club's history: Real was knocked out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage for the fifth time in a row, losing to Liverpool 0–5 on aggregate, and was embarrassed by Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu with a humiliating 2–6 loss, which all but confirmed the league title for Barça that went on to win the treble.[89] On 1 June 2009, Florentino Pérez regained Real Madrid's presidency amid the outrage over the club's decline.[90][91] Pérez continued with the Galácticos policy pursued in his first term, buying Kaká from Milan for a record-breaking (in pounds sterling) sum of £56 million,[92] and then breaking the record again by purchasing Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United for £80 million.[93] Real Madrid spent in excess of €261 million in the summer of 2009, and the assembled team was soon dubbed the Second Galácticos.[94] The 2009–10 season, however, was a transitional one as Madrid again finished second in the league, although this time amassing 96 points, the club's record at the time, and went out of the Champions League at the hands of Lyon. The season was marred by Cristiano Ronaldo's injury, that sidelined him for seven weeks,[95] although he still topped the goalscoring charts with 33 goals, and Madrid became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals. Real Madrid also had the misfortune to become the runners-up with the highest points total in the history of Europe's top five leagues, until surpassed by Liverpool's 97 points in 2018–19.[96][97] José Mourinho took over as manager in May 2010.[98][99] In the 2010–11 season, the rebuilt Madrid successfully fought on all fronts, going toe to toe with a brilliant Barcelona side which some regard as the greatest team in football history. Ultimately, Madrid finished second in the league, with 92 points and four behind their perennial rivals, defeated them in the Copa del Rey final, and lost to Barça in the Champions League semi-finals, where Real progressed to for the first time since 2002–03. Moreover, from 16 April through 3 May, a rare occurrence happened when, for the first time ever, four Clásicos were to be played in a span of just 18 days. The first fixture was in the league campaign on 16 April (which ended 1–1 with penalty goals for both sides), the second one was in the Copa del Rey final (which was won by Madrid 1–0 a.e.t., bringing them their first trophy in the second Galáctico era) on 20 April and the third and fourth ones in the controversial[100][101] two-legged Champions League semi-finals on 27 April and 3 May (Barcelona won on aggregate with a 2–0 away victory and a 1–1 home draw).[102] Madrid again became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals, repeating its output from the previous season, with Ronaldo scoring 40 and winning the European Golden Shoe. In the 2011–12 season, Real Madrid won La Liga for a record 32nd time in its history, also finishing the season with numerous league records set, including 100 points amassed in a single season, a total of 121 goals scored, a goal difference of +89, 16 away games won, and 32 wins overall.[103] They also competed in the UEFA Champions League for the 15th successive season,[104] losing in the semi-finals to Bayern Munich in a penalty shoot-out after a 3–3 aggregate tie. Madrid entered the Copa del Rey as the defending champions, but lost 3–4 on aggregate in the quarter-finals to Barcelona. In the same season, Cristiano Ronaldo became the fastest player to reach 100 goals scored in Spanish league history. In reaching 101 goals in 92 games, Ronaldo surpassed Real Madrid legend Ferenc Puskás, who scored 100 goals in 105 matches. Ronaldo set a new club mark for individual goals scored in one year (60) and became the first player ever to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single season.[105][106] Real Madrid started the 2012–13 season by winning the Supercopa de España, defeating Barcelona on away goals. However, the super cup turned out to be their only trophy of the season, despite being close to win them all. Real finished runners-up to Barça in La Liga, accumulating 85 points, and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League for the third year in a row, where they were eliminated by Borussia Dortmund 3–4 on aggregate. Madrid also entered the Copa del Rey in the round of 32, going on a memorable run to the final, which saw them defeat Barcelona in the semi-finals before losing to Atlético Madrid 1–2 a.e.t. Real Madrid faced the Blaugrana six times throughout the season, coming away with three wins, two draws, and one loss. A major transfer of the season was the signing of Luka Modrić from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in the region of £33 million.[107] After a loss to Atlético in the Copa del Rey final, Pérez announced the departure of José Mourinho at the end of the season by \"mutual agreement\".[108] On 25 June 2013, Carlo Ancelotti succeeded Mourinho to become the manager of Real Madrid on a three-year deal, with Zinedine Zidane named as one of his assistants.[109] On 1 September 2013, the long-awaited transfer of Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur was announced. The transfer of the Welshman was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer price approximated at €100 million.[110] In Ancelotti's first season at the club, Real Madrid fought on all three fronts for the continental treble. Despite leading in the league campaign on multiple occasions, Madrid ultimately finished in third place (level on points with Barcelona and three behind cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid), collecting 87 points in total and scoring a record 104 goals.[111] By that time, Los Blancos had already secured the Copa del Rey – against rivals Barcelona – in April, with Bale scoring the winner.[112] The major breakthrough came in the UEFA Champions League, where Real returned to the final after twelve years, having beaten defending champions Bayern Munich 5–0 on aggregate in the semi-finals.[113] In the final, they defeated then-recently-league winners Atlético Madrid 4–1 a.e.t. to clinch their tenth European Cup (first since 2002) and become the first team to win ten European Cups/Champions League titles, an achievement known as \"La Décima\" (Spanish: \"The Tenth,\" [la ˈðeθima]).[114] Real's attacking trio of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, dubbed the BBC, finished the season with 97 goals.[115] After winning the 2014 Champions League, Real Madrid signed goalkeeper Keylor Navas, midfielder Toni Kroos and attacking midfielder James Rodríguez.[116] In August, Madrid won the 2014 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, the club's 79th official trophy.[117] During the last week of the 2014 summer transfer window, Real Madrid sold two players key to the previous season's successes: Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich and Ángel Di María to Manchester United. This decision by the club was surrounded by controversy, with Cristiano Ronaldo stating, \"If I was in charge, maybe I would have done things differently,\" while Carlo Ancelotti admitted, \"We must start again from zero.\"[118] After a slow start to the 2014–15 season, Real Madrid went on a record-breaking 22-match winning streak, which included wins against Barcelona and Liverpool, surpassing the previous Spanish record of 18 successive wins set by Frank Rijkaard's Barça in the 2005–06 season.[119] In late December, Real Madrid won their first Club World Cup, defeating San Lorenzo 2–0 in the final.[120] The winning streak came to an end in their opening match of 2015 with a loss to Valencia, leaving the club two short of equalling the world record of 24 consecutive wins.[121] Madrid was in contention for both the La Liga title and the UEFA Champions League until the very end but ultimately came up short, finishing with 92 points in the league, two behind treble-winning Barcelona and losing to Juventus 2–3 on aggregate in the Champions League semi-finals.[122] Ronaldo finished the season scoring 48 league goals, winning his fourth European Golden Shoe, and 61 goals in all competitions, breaking his record from 2011 to 2012.[123] Overall, despite playing an attractive attacking football and being the highest scoring team in Europe with 118 league goals,[124] several narrow defeats meant that Real finished the season with two trophies out of six possible, which contributed to the dismissal of Carlo Ancelotti on 25 May 2015.[125][126] On 3 June 2015, Rafael Benítez was confirmed as the new Real Madrid manager for the 2015–16 season, signing a three-year contract.[127] Real Madrid remained unbeaten in the league until a 3–2 loss at Sevilla on the matchday 11. This was followed by a 0–4 home loss in the first Clásico of the season against Barcelona. Perhaps, his reign is best remembered by multiple lopsided wins achieved both in La Liga and the Champions League (6–0 vs Espanyol, 8–0 vs Malmö, 10–2 vs Rayo Vallecano and others). In the Copa del Rey round of 32, Real accidentally fielded an ineligible player in a 3–1 first leg win at Cádiz and was disqualified from the tournament two days later by the competition judge, despite protests from president Pérez.[128][129][130] In the meantime, Madrid comfortably topped their UCL group with 16 points and a +16 goal difference. Benítez was relieved of his duties on 4 January 2016 following allegations of unpopularity with supporters, displeasure with players and a failure to get good results against top teams.[131] Benítez's departure was announced along with the promotion of Zinedine Zidane to his first head coaching role.[132] Under Zidane, Madrid managed to turn the odds in its favour, ultimately winning the Champions League, something no one expected. The notable results include a 2–1 away victory over reigning treble winners Barcelona, who were on a record-breaking winning streak, a fantastic comeback against Wolfsburg in the Champions League quarter-finals (after losing the away game 0–2, Madrid erased the deficit and won 3–0 at home, courtesy of a Cristiano Ronaldo hat-trick), as well as a 12-game winning streak to conclude the league campaign, meaning Real finished second, with 90 points and just one point behind champions Barcelona, coming agonizingly close to clinching the title and overcoming a 12-point deficit in the process.[133] Finally, on 28 May, Real Madrid's eleventh Champions League title was won thanks to a 5–3 penalty shoot-out victory over rivals Atlético Madrid after a 1–1 draw in the final, with the achievement being termed \"La Undécima\".[134][135][126] Real Madrid began their 2016–17 campaign, which was to be Zidane's first full season in charge of the club, with a victory in the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla.[136] On 10 December 2016, Madrid played their 35th-straight match without a loss, which set a new club record.[137] On 18 December 2016, the club defeated Japanese outfit Kashima Antlers 4–2 in the final of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup.[138] With a 3–3 draw at Sevilla in the second leg of the Copa del Rey round of 16 on 12 January 2017, Madrid progressed to the quarter-finals with a 6–3 aggregate victory and extended its unbeaten run to 40 matches, breaking Barcelona's Spanish record of 39 matches unbeaten in all competitions from the previous season.[139] Their unbeaten streak ended after a 1–2 away loss against the same opposition in La Liga three days later.[140] The team then was knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Celta Vigo 3–4 on aggregate. These slips, however, did not affect the overall trajectory of the season. In May, Madrid won the league title for a record 33rd time, their first title in five years, accumulating 93 points in the process.[141] On 3 June 2017, the club's victory over Juventus in the Champions League final resulted in Real Madrid becoming the first team to successfully defend their title in the UEFA Champions League era, and the first to win consecutive titles in the competition since Milan in 1989 and 1990, when the tournament was known as the European Cup.[142][143] Real Madrid's title was its 12th, extending the record, and its third in four years. The achievement is also known as \"La Duodécima\".[144] The 2016–17 season was the greatest campaign in terms of trophies won (four out of possible five) in the history of Real Madrid, an achievement that would be later equalled in the 2017–18 season.[145] Real kicked off the 2017–18 campaign by winning its second consecutive and fourth overall UEFA Super Cup in a 2–1 victory against Manchester United.[146] Five days later, Real Madrid beat Barcelona at the Camp Nou 3–1 in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de España and then defeated Barça 2–0 in the return leg, ending their 24 consecutive match scoring record in El Clásico matches and winning the second trophy of the season.[147] On 16 December 2017, Real beat Brazilian club Grêmio 1–0 in the FIFA Club World Cup final and became the first team to retain the trophy.[148] In the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, Madrid once again progressed to the final where they defeated Liverpool 3–1 to become the first club to win three straight titles in the Champions League era, as well as the first team to win three consecutive titles in the European Cup/Champions League since Bayern Munich in 1976. The trophy also marked Madrid's fourth win in five years and their eighth consecutive semi-finals appearance. On 31 May, only five days after winning the final, Zidane announced his resignation as Real Madrid manager, citing the club's \"need for change\" as his rationale for departing.[149][150] Zidane's and Ronaldo's departures marked the end of the Second Galáctico Era that yielded four Champions League titles, two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey, two Supercopa de España, three UEFA Super Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cup titles. The team was instrumental in ending Barcelona's dominance, despite the Blaugrana boasting arguably the greatest collection of talent in history,[151] and overshadowed the Catalans on the European stage.[152] Real Madrid was also somewhat notoriously unlucky in its league campaigns throughout these nine years, finishing runners-up with 96, 92 (twice) and 90 points, as well as on 87 points in third place, just three off the league winners.[97] On 12 June 2018, Real Madrid named Julen Lopetegui, the head coach of the Spanish national team, as their new manager. It was announced that he would officially begin his managerial duties after the 2018 FIFA World Cup. However, the Spanish national team sacked Lopetegui a day prior to the tournament, stating that he had negotiated terms with the club without informing them.[153][154] The club then began re-shaping the squad in the summer of 2018, which included the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus for a reported €117 million.[155] Madrid began their 2018–19 campaign by losing to Atlético Madrid 2–4 a.e.t. in the 2018 UEFA Super Cup. After a 1–5 loss to Barcelona in El Clásico on 28 October which left Real Madrid in the ninth place with only 14 points after ten games, Lopetegui was dismissed a day later and replaced by then Castilla coach, Santiago Solari.[156] On 22 December 2018, Real Madrid beat Al Ain 4–1 in the FIFA Club World Cup and became the outright record winners of the Club World Cup with four titles.[157] However, they were then knocked out of the Copa del Rey at the semi-final stage by Barcelona, losing 1–4 on aggregate. On 5 March 2019, Real was defeated by Ajax 1–4 (3–5 on aggregate) at home, crashing out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage after eight consecutive semi-finals appearances. On 11 March 2019, Real Madrid dismissed Solari and reinstated Zidane as the head coach of the club.[158] Madrid finished the season with 68 points and a +17 goal difference, its lowest totals since 2001–02 and 1999–2000 respectively.[159] In the summer of 2019, Madrid signed Eden Hazard, Luka Jović, Éder Militão, Ferland Mendy, Rodrygo, Reinier and other players for a total of more than €350 million.[160] On 12 January 2020, Madrid beat cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid in a penalty shootout in the Supercopa de España final to win their eleventh title.[161] After a three-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, La Liga was restarted in June and Madrid won ten games in a row to capture the team's 34th league title, collecting 87 points in total.[162] From the competition's resumption in June and until the end of the 2020–21 season, Real temporarily played home fixtures at the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium, while the Santiago Bernabéu underwent extensive renovations.[163][164] Zidane left a second time on 27 May 2021 after going trophyless that season,[165] with Carlo Ancelotti returning to coach the team for the 2021–22 season.[166] On the domestic front, he delivered two trophies out of possible three, winning La Liga and the Supercopa de España.[167][168][169] As such, Ancelotti won all six available top trophies at Madrid.[170] In the Champions League, Madrid produced one of the most memorable runs of all time,[171] defeating pre-tournament favourites Paris Saint-Germain,[172][173] defending champions and favourites Chelsea,[174] Premier League champions and heavy favourites Manchester City,[175] all in dramatic fashion,[176] and setting up the final against Liverpool, who were once again widely considered as favourites,[177] in a rematch of their 2018 encounter. A lone Vinícius Júnior goal sealed the 14th European Cup for Los Blancos, their fifth in nine years, and Ancelotti's second in charge.[178][179] Real also claimed their fourth ever European double (after 1956–57, 1957–58, and 2016–17). Despite Real's status as the most decorated team in the history of the Champions League, they were not favoured to win that year's edition, and their improbable run was widely considered a surprise.[180] After a highly successful 2021–22 season, Real Madrid signed German defender Antonio Rüdiger and French midfielder Aurélien Tchouaméni, while club legends Marcelo, Isco, Gareth Bale and Casemiro left the club. Real Madrid's 2022–23 season began with lifting the UEFA Super Cup and later the FIFA Club World Cup. The season ended with Real Madrid winning the 2022–23 Copa del Rey, but losing the La Liga and Spanish Super Cup to FC Barcelona and the Champions League to Manchester City, being defeated 5–1 on aggregate. In 2023, Real Madrid signed Jude Bellingham, who was given the number #5 jersey, previously used by Zinedine Zidane. Real also signed Arda Güler and Fran García. Meanwhile, Vinícius Júnior was given the number #7 jersey, previously used by Raúl and Cristiano Ronaldo; while Rodrygo was given the number #11 jersey, previously used by Gareth Bale. Karim Benzema left the club, while Toni Kroos would later announce that he would retire from football after this season. The 2023-24 season would prove to be another highly successful season for Los Blancos. First, Real Madrid lifted the Spanish Super Cup against Barcelona 4–1, taking revenge of the previous year's 3–0 defeat. Then, Real Madrid lifted the La Liga with relative ease, reaching 95 points, the second-best winning campaign by Real Madrid in La Liga history after the 2011–12 100 points season. In the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League, Real Madrid knocked out RB Leipzig in the Round of 16, then defending champions Manchester City in penalties. In the semifinals, Real Madrid faced Bayern Munich again. The first match was a 2–2 draw, while the second match in the Bernabéu was marked by a double by Joselu in the last few minutes of the game, with Bayern Munich suffering a historic comeback after leading 1–0. Real Madrid faced Borussia Dortmund in the final, and won 2–0, with Dani Carvajal being the man of the match and scoring with a header after a Toni Kroos corner, and Vinícius Júnior once again scoring in a UCL final. Real Madrid won their 15th Champions League without losing a single match during the campaign. Following the conclusion of the 2023–24 season, Real Madrid announced that striker Kylian Mbappé would be joining the club on a free transfer from Paris Saint-Germain in July 2024, concluding one of the most highly anticipated transfer sagas in modern history.[181] The first crest had a simple design consisting of a decorative interlacing of the three initials of the club, \"MCF\" for Madrid Club de Fútbol, in dark blue on a white shirt. The first change in the crest occurred in 1908 when the letters adopted a more streamlined form and appeared inside a circle.[182] The next change in the configuration of the crest did not occur until the presidency of Pedro Parages in 1920. At that time, King Alfonso XIII granted the club his royal patronage which came in the form of the title \"Real Madrid,\" meaning \"Royal.\"[183] Thus, Alfonso's crown was added to the crest and the club styled itself Real Madrid Club de Fútbol.[182] With the dissolution of the monarchy in 1931, all royal symbols (the crown on the crest and the title of Real) were eliminated. The crown was replaced by the dark mulberry band of the Region of Castile.[48] In 1941, two years after Nationalist victory in the Civil War, the Francoist regime restored the crest's \"Real Corona\", or \"Royal Crown\", while the mulberry stripe of Castile was retained as well.[184][56] In addition, the whole crest was made full color, with gold being the most prominent, and the club went back to its honorific name Real Madrid Club de Fútbol.[182] The most recent modification to the crest occurred in 2001 when the club wanted to better situate itself for the 21st century and further standardize its crest. One of the modifications made was changing the mulberry stripe to a more bluish shade.[182] Real Madrid has maintained the white shirt for its home kit throughout the history of the club. There was, however, one season that the shirt and shorts were not both white. It was an initiative undertaken by Juan Padrós in honour of an English team Corinthian, which he had met on one of his trips, one of the most famous teams at the time known for its elegance and sportsmanship.[43] It was decided that Real Madrid would wear black shorts in an attempt to replicate the English team, which had also inspired Madrid's original white kit, but the initiative lasted just one year. After being eliminated from the cup by Barcelona with a 1–5 defeat in Madrid and a 2–0 defeat in Catalonia, President Parages decided to return to an all-white kit, claiming that the other kit brought bad luck.[note 3] By the early 1940s, the manager changed the kit again by adding buttons to the shirt and the club's crest on the left breast, which has remained ever since. On 23 November 1947, in a game against Atlético Madrid at the Metropolitano Stadium, Real Madrid became the first Spanish team to wear numbered shirts.[56] English club Leeds United permanently switched their blue shirt for a white one in the 1960s, to emulate the dominant Real Madrid of the era.[185] Real's traditional away colours are all blue or all purple. Since the advent of the replica kit market, the club has also released various other one colour designs, including red, green, orange and black. The club's kit is manufactured by Adidas, whose contract extends from 1998.[186][187] Real Madrid's first shirt sponsor, Zanussi, agreed for the 1982–83, 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons. Following that, the club was sponsored by Parmalat and Otaysa before a long-term deal was signed with Teka in 1992.[188][189] In 2001, Real Madrid ended their contract with Teka and for one season and used the Realmadrid.com logo to promote the club's website. Then, in 2002, a deal was signed with Siemens and in 2006, the BenQ Siemens logo appeared on the club's shirt.[190] Real Madrid's shirt sponsor from 2007 until 2013 was bwin.com following the economic problems of BenQ Siemens.[191][192] Fly Emirates became their shirt sponsor in 2013, and in 2017 the club renewed the sponsorship with the airliner, signing a deal until 2022 worth €70 million per year.[193] In 2022, the agreement was again extended, until 2026.[194] In 2015, Madrid signed a new ten-year contract with Adidas, believed to be worth a total of £850 million (€1 billion), with the club earning £59 million (€64 million) per season. The contract includes a clause sanctioning penalty or agreement termination anytime, if Real Madrid fails to qualify for the European competitions or is relegated from La Liga.[195] Note: early termination clauses can be activated at any time depending on the team's performance. After moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912, which remained its home stadium for 11 years.[45] After this period, the club moved for one year to the Campo de Ciudad Lineal, a small ground with a capacity of 8,000 spectators. After that, Real Madrid started playing its home matches at the Estadio Chamartín, which was inaugurated on 17 May 1923 with a match against Newcastle United.[201] In this stadium, which hosted 22,500 spectators, Real Madrid celebrated its first Spanish league title.[47] Following his election in 1943, president Santiago Bernabéu decided that the Chamartín was not big enough for the ambitions of the club, and thus a new stadium was built and inaugurated on 14 December 1947.[56][202] Initially knows as Nuevo Chamartín, the stadium was renamed in honour of Bernabéu in 1955 and continues to bear his name to this day.[57] The first match at the Bernabéu was played between Madrid and the Portuguese club Belenenses, with Los Blancos winning 3–1 and Sabino Barinaga scoring the first goal.[56] The capacity has changed frequently, peaking at 120,000 after a 1953 expansion.[203] Since then, there have been a number of reductions due to modernizations (the last standing areas were removed in 1998–99 in response to UEFA regulations which had forbidden standing at matches in European competitions), countered to some extent by expansions.[203] The current capacity is 81,044 spectators. Real Madrid has the fourth-highest average attendance in Europe, behind Borussia Dortmund, Barcelona and Manchester United.[204][205][206][207] The Bernabéu has hosted the 1964 UEFA European Championship final, the 1982 FIFA World Cup final, and the 1957, 1969, 1980 and 2010 European Cup/Champions League finals.[208] The stadium has its own namesake Madrid Metro station along the 10 line.[209] On 14 November 2007, the Bernabéu was upgraded to Elite Football Stadium status by UEFA.[210] On 9 May 2006, the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium, named after club legend Alfredo Di Stéfano, was inaugurated in the Real Madrid City, where Real Madrid usually trains. The inaugural match was played between Real Madrid and Reims, a rematch of the 1956 European Cup final. Real Madrid 6–1, with goals from Sergio Ramos, Antonio Cassano (2), Roberto Soldado (2) and José Manuel Jurado. The venue is now part of the Ciudad Real Madrid, the club's training facility located outside Madrid, in Valdebebas. The stadium's capacity is 5,000 people, and it is Real Madrid Castilla's home ground.[211] For the latter part of the 2019–20 season and throughout the 2020–21 season, the stadium hosted the first team's home games due to a combination of the COVID-19 pandemic-triggered restrictions and an extensive renovation of the Santiago Bernabéu.[212][164] The latest renovation of the Santiago Bernabéu is set to increase the capacity by approximately 4,000 with the addition of an extra tier, bringing it to nearly 85,000.[213][214] Furthermore, the height will also be increased by ten metres and a retractable roof, a retractable pitch and a 360-degree screen will be installed.[215][216] The works have started in 2019, and the renovated stadium was initially planned to be unveiled in 2022; however, the COVID-19 pandemic and Russian invasion of Ukraine caused significant disruption to supply chains, prompting the club to postpone the stadium's inauguration to 2023.[217][218] Raúl holds the record for most appearances with Real Madrid, with 741 appearances from 1994 to 2010. Iker Casillas comes second with 725 appearances, followed by Manuel Sanchis Jr., having played 710 times.[219] The record for a goalkeeper is held by Iker Casillas, with 725 appearances. With 63 goals, Cristiano Ronaldo has scored the most international goals while playing for the club. Meanwhile, Sergio Ramos has accumulated the most caps while playing for the club, with 176. Cristiano Ronaldo (2009–2018) is Real Madrid's all-time top goalscorer, with 450 goals in 438 matches.[220][221] Six other players have also scored over 200 goals for Real: Alfredo Di Stéfano (1953–1964), Santillana (1971–1988), Ferenc Puskás (1958–1966), Hugo Sánchez (1985–1992), Karim Benzema (2009–2023) and the previous goalscoring record-holder Raúl (1994–2010). Cristiano Ronaldo also holds the record for the most league goals scored in one season (48 in 2014–15), alongside being Real's top goalscorer of all time in La Liga history with 311 goals. Di Stéfano's 49 goals in 58 matches was for decades the all-time highest tally in the European Cup, until it was surpassed by Raúl in 2005, and is now held by Cristiano Ronaldo with 105 goals for Madrid and 140 overall. The fastest goal in the history of the club (13 seconds) was scored by the Chilean Iván Zamorano on 3 September 1994 during a league match against Sevilla.[222] Officially, the highest home attendance figure for a Real Madrid match is 129,690, which was for a European Cup match in 1956 against Milan. The current official capacity of the Santiago Bernabéu is 80,000.[223] Real has also set records in Spanish football, most notably the most domestic titles (36 as of 2023–24) and the most seasons won in a row (five, during 1960–65 and 1985–90).[1] With 121 matches (from 17 February 1957 to 7 March 1965), the club holds the record for longest unbeaten run at home in La Liga.[224] The club also holds the record for winning the European Cup/UEFA Champions League fifteen times[225] and for the most semi-finals appearances (33). As of June 2024, Cristiano Ronaldo is the all-time top scorer in the UEFA Champions League, with 140 (141 including qualifiers) goals in total, 105 while playing for Real Madrid. The team has the record number of consecutive participations in the European Cup (before it became the Champions League) with 15, from 1955–56 to 1969–70.[226] Among the club's on-field records is a 22-game winning streak in all competitions during the 2014–15 season, a Spanish record. In September 2017, the club equalled the record of the Brazilian club Santos, starring Pelé, by scoring in their 73rd consecutive game, before Bayern Munich breaks the record in 2021.[227] In June 2009, the club broke its own record for the highest transfer fee ever paid in the history of football after purchasing Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo for €94 million (£80 million).[228][229] The fee of €77.5 million (100 billion lire) for Zinedine Zidane's transfer from Juventus to Real Madrid in 2001 was the previous highest transfer fee ever paid. This record (in pounds sterling) had been broken previously in June 2009, for a few days, when Real Madrid agreed to buy Kaká from Milan for €67 million (£65 million). The transfer of Tottenham Hotspur's Gareth Bale in 2013 was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer fee approximated at around €100 million.[110] In January 2016, documents pertaining to Bale's transfer were leaked which confirmed a world record transfer fee of €100,759,418.[230] Real Madrid equalled their record signing in 2019, when the club signed Eden Hazard from Chelsea for a reported €115 million.[231] The club's record sale occurred on 10 July 2018, when Juventus signed Cristiano Ronaldo for €117 million.[232] During most home matches, the majority of the seats in the stadium are occupied by season-ticket holders, of which the figure is capped at 65,000.[233] To become a season ticket holder one must first be a socio, or club member. In addition to members, the club has more than 1,800 peñas (official, club-affiliated supporters' groups) in Spain and around the world. Real Madrid has the second highest average all-time attendance in Spanish football and regularly attracts over 74,000 fans to the Bernabéu. One of the best supported teams globally, Real Madrid was the first sports team (and first brand) to reach 100 million fans on Facebook in April 2017.[234][235] Real Madrid's hardcore supporters are the so-called Ultras Sur supporters, or simply Ultras. They are known for their extreme right-wing politics, akin to Barcelona's hardcore supporters group Boixos Nois. The Ultras Surs have developed an alliance with other right wing groups, most notably Lazio Irriducibili fans, and have also developed an alliance with left-wing groups. On several occasions, they have racially abused opposing players, and have been investigated by UEFA for doing so.[236][237] Florentino Pérez took it upon himself to ban the Ultras from the Bernabéu and assign their seats to the general public. This decision was controversial with some of the Bernabéu faithful, however, as the lively atmosphere of games would suffer as a result.[238][239] The Ultras have since held protests outside the Bernabéu and have demanded to be reinstated and allowed to enter the grounds.[240] Questioned over Pope Francis' adherence to 2014 FIFA Club World Cup Final opponents San Lorenzo, Madrid captain Sergio Ramos stated: \"In the semi-finals we noticed the love from supporters in Marrakesh and it seemed like we were playing at home. That sums up the greatness of this team. Madrid is God's team and the team of the world\".[241] Among the club's famous supporters is golfer Sergio García, who was invited to take the honorary kickoff for El Clásico at the Bernabeu wearing his green jacket from winning the 2017 Masters.[242] There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Real Madrid and Barcelona is known as \"The Classic\" (El Clásico). From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Castile and Catalonia, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between the Castilians and Catalans, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.[243] Over the years, the record for Real Madrid and Barcelona is 100 victories for Madrid, 97 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws.[244] As early as the 1930s, Barcelona \"had developed a reputation as a symbol of Catalan identity, opposed to the centralising tendencies of Madrid\".[246][247] During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera and especially Francisco Franco, all regional languages and identities in Spain were frowned upon and restrained. As such, most citizens of Barcelona were in strong opposition to Franco's regime. In that period, Barcelona gained their motto Més que un club (English: More than a club) because of its alleged connection to Catalan nationalist as well as to progressive beliefs.[248] There is an ongoing controversy as to what extent Franco's rule (1939–75) influenced the activities and on-pitch results of both Barcelona and Real Madrid. Fans of both clubs tend to exaggerate the myths favouring their narratives. Most historians agree that Franco did not have a preferred football team, but his Spanish nationalist beliefs led him to associate himself with the establishment teams, such as Atlético Aviación and Madrid FC (that recovered its \"royal\" name after the fall of the Republic and again became Real Madrid). On the other hand, he also wanted the renamed Barcelona succeed as \"Spanish team\", rather than a Catalan one. During the early years of Franco's rule, Real Madrid were not particularly successful, winning two Copa del Generalísimo titles and a Copa Eva Duarte; Barcelona claimed three league titles, one Copa del Generalísimo and one Copa Eva Duarte. During that period, Atlético Aviación were believed to be the preferred team over Real Madrid. The most contested stories of the period include Real Madrid's 11–1 home win against Barcelona in the Copa del Generalísimo, where the Catalan team alleged intimidation, and the controversial transfer of Alfredo Di Stéfano to Real Madrid, despite his agreement with Barcelona. The latter transfer was part of Real Madrid chairman Santiago Bernabéu's \"revolution\" that ushered in the era of unprecedented dominance. Bernabéu, himself a veteran of the Civil War who fought for Franco's forces, saw Real Madrid on top, not only of Spanish, but also European football, helping create the European Cup, the first true competition for Europe's best club sides. His vision was fulfilled when Real Madrid not only started winning consecutive league titles, but also swept the first five editions of the European Cup in the 1950s.[249] These events had a profound impact on Spanish football and influenced Franco's attitude. According to historians, during this time he realized the importance of Real Madrid for his regime's international image, and the club became his preferred team until his death. Fernando Maria Castiella, who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs under Franco from 1957 until 1969, noted that \"[Real Madrid] is the best embassy we have ever had\". Franco died in 1975, and the Spanish transition to democracy soon followed. Under his rule, Real Madrid had won 14 league titles, six Copa del Generalísimo titles, one Copa Eva Duarte, six European Cups, two Latin Cups and one Intercontinental Cup. In the same period, Barcelona had won eight league titles, nine Copa del Generalísimo titles, three Copa Eva Duarte titles, three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups and two Latin Cups.[250][184] The rivalry was intensified during the 1950s when the clubs disputed the signing of Alfredo Di Stéfano. Di Stéfano had impressed both Barcelona and Real Madrid while playing for Los Millonarios in Bogotá, Colombia, during a players' strike in his native Argentina. Soon after Millonarios' return to Colombia, Barcelona directors visited Buenos Aires and agreed with River Plate, the last FIFA-affiliated team to have held Di Stéfano's rights, for his transfer in 1954 for the equivalent of 150 million Italian lira (according to other sources 200,000 dollars). This started a battle between the two Spanish rivals for his rights. FIFA appointed Armando Muñoz Calero, former president of the Spanish Football Federation as mediator. Calero decided to let Di Stéfano play the 1953–54 and 1955–56 seasons in Madrid, and the 1954–55 and 1956–57 seasons in Barcelona. The agreement was approved by the Football Association and their respective clubs. Although the Catalans agreed, the decision created various discontent among the Blaugrana members and the president was forced to resign in September 1953. Barcelona sold Madrid their half-share, and Di Stéfano moved to Los Blancos, signing a four-year contract. Real paid 5.5 million Spanish pesetas for the transfer, plus a 1.3 million bonus for the purchase, an annual fee to be paid to the Millonarios, and a 16,000 salary for Di Stéfano with a bonus double that of his teammates, for a total of 40% of the annual revenue of the Madrid club.[251] Di Stéfano became integral in the subsequent success achieved by Real Madrid, scoring twice in his first game against Barcelona. With him, Madrid won the first five editions of the European Cup.[252] The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when Real Madrid and Barcelona met twice in the European Cup, with Madrid triumphing en route to their fifth consecutive title in 1959–60 and Barcelona prevailing en route to losing the final in 1960–61. Ahead of the 1973–74 season, Johan Cruyff arrived to Barcelona for a world record £920,000 from Ajax.[253] Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Francisco Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son \"Jordi\", after the local Catalan Saint George.[254] In 2002, the European encounter between the clubs was dubbed the \"Match of The Century\" by Spanish media, and Madrid's win was watched by more than 500 million people around the world.[255] A fixture known for its intensity and indiscipline, it has also featured memorable goal celebrations from both teams, often involving mocking the opposition.[256] In October 1999, Real Madrid forward Raúl silenced 100,000 Barcelona fans at the Camp Nou when he scored before he celebrated by putting a finger to his lips as if telling the crowd to be quiet.[256][257] In 2009, Barcelona captain Carles Puyol kissed his Catalan armband in front of Madrid fans at the Bernabéu.[256] Cristiano Ronaldo twice gestured to the hostile crowd to \"calm down\" after scoring against Barcelona at the Camp Nou in 2012 and 2016.[256] In April 2017, Messi celebrated his 93rd-minute winner for Barcelona against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu by taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans – with his name and number facing them.[256] Later that year, in August, Ronaldo was subbed on in the first leg of the Supercopa de España, proceeded to score in the 80th minute and took his shirt off before holding it up to Barça's fans with his name and number facing them.[258] The club's nearest neighbour is Atlético Madrid, a rivalry being shared between fans of both football teams. Although Atlético was founded by three Basque students in 1903, it was joined in 1904 by dissident members of \"Madrid FC\". The two teams met for the first time on 2 December 1906 in the regional championship, with Real Madrid winning 2–1. Their first league meeting came on 21 February 1929 in matchday three of the first league championship at the former Chamartín. It was the first official derby of the new tournament, and Real won 2–1.[47] After the Civil War, during the early Francoist period, Atlético became associated with the military air force (and thus renamed Atlético Aviación), although the alleged preference of the regime for the club is subject to discussion. In any case, during this period Atlético became the most successful club in Spain, reducing the historical gap between the two clubs, until the regime preference shifted towards Real Madrid in the 1950s, as Franco sought to make political capital out of Real Madrid's multiple European Cup titles at a time when Spain was internationally isolated; one minister said, \"Real Madrid are the best ambassadors we've ever had.\"[184] Thus, Atlético fans regularly chanted that Real were \"El equipo del gobierno, la vergüenza del país\" – \"The team of the government, the shame of the country\" – and allegedly adopted a more left-wing slant (tempered by the rise of ultras culture and Rayo Vallecano's presence as the \"true\" leftist club in Madrid).[259][260] The rivalry first gained international attention in 1959 during the European Cup when the two clubs met in the semi-finals. Real won the first leg 2–1 at the Santiago Bernabéu, while Atlético won 1–0 at the Metropolitano. The tie went to a replay, which Real won 2–1. Atlético, however, gained some revenge when, led by former Real Madrid coach José Villalonga, it defeated its city rivals in two successive Copa del Generalísimo finals in 1960 and 1961.[261] In the 1970s, Atlético again took the lead as the most successful Spanish club of the decade, which prompted the Real Madrid fanbase to look down on Atlético calling them and their supporters \"Indios\" (Indians, a reference to the Latin American players signed by the Red-and-whites).[262] By then, Real Madrid did not want to sign non-Caucasian players (president Santiago Bernabéu even stated, when he decided not to sign Portuguese star Eusebio at the end of the 1960s, \"Mientras yo viva, aquí no jugará ningún negro ni un blanco con bigote\" (\"As long as I live, no black or white with a mustache will play here\").[263] Atlético's supporters accepted the new \"Indian\" nickname joyfully and have been using it until today. The Santiago Bernabéu, Real Madrid's stadium, is alongside banks and businesses on the upper class Paseo de la Castellana street, while the Vicente Calderón (the stadium that Atlético Madrid used until the 2016–17 season) could be found near a brewery, alongside the Manzanares River and a motorway. Real draw greater support all across the region because of their historically greater resources and success, while Atlético have a relatively working class fan base mainly from the south of the city, with some fans also scattered throughout the city.[264][265] In fact, the Atlético crest includes the Coat of arms of Madrid, whereas Real crest has no such a reference to the city (instead, it includes a reference to the broader Castile region). Between 1961 and 1989, when Real dominated La Liga, only Atlético offered it any serious challenge, winning league titles in 1966, 1970, 1973 and 1977. In 1965, Atlético became the first team to beat Real at the Bernabéu in eight years. Real Madrid's record against Atlético in more recent times is very favourable.[266] A high point came in the 2002–03 season, when Real clinched the La Liga title after a 4–0 victory at the Vicente Calderón. Atlético's first win over its city rivals since 1999 came in the Copa del Rey final in May 2013. In 2013–14, Real and Atlético were finalists of the UEFA Champions League, the first final which hosted two clubs from the same city. Real Madrid triumphed with a 4–1 comeback victory in extra time.[267] On 7 February 2015, Real suffered their first defeat in 14 years at the Vicente Calderón, a 4–0 loss.[268] On 28 May 2016, Real and Atlético again met for the Champions League title, which resulted in a win for Real after a penalty shootout at San Siro.[269] A further minor rivalry exists between Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao. This is known as El Viejo Clásico (the old classic),[270] so named as the two clubs were dominant in the first half of the 20th century, meeting in nine Copa del Rey finals including the first in 1903.[271][272] Until 10 December 2011, this fixture was the most played in the history of Spanish football, when it was surpassed by El Clásico.[273] Athletic Bilbao, who operate a policy of only using local players,[274] have long since ceased to be a competitive rival to clubs such as Real Madrid who scour the globe for the best talent; the Lions won only two of the 26 matches between the teams from 2005–06 to 2016–17.[270][275][276] However, the matches remain keenly fought due to their historical and cultural significance, with some parallels to the political aspect of the Barcelona/Catalonia rivalry as Athletic are the largest club in the Basque region.[277][260][278] Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are two of the most successful clubs in the UEFA Champions League/European Cup competition, with Real winning 15 times and Bayern winning six times.[279][280] Although they have never met in a final, Real Madrid versus Bayern is the match that has historically been played most often in the Champions League/European Cup with 26 matches (twelve wins for Madrid, eleven wins for Bayern, with three draws),[281] with several controversial incidents occurring due to the great importance of most of their meetings.[282][283][284] Real Madrid supporters often refer to Bayern as the \"Bestia negra\" (\"Black Beast\"). During the 2010s, the two teams met in the 2011–12 Champions League semi-finals, which ended 3–3 on aggregate (Bayern won 3–1 on penalties after extra time, but lost the final at their own stadium by the same method), then at the same stage in the 2013–14 edition with Real Madrid winning 5–0 on aggregate,[285] and again in 2017–18 with the Spanish club progressing 4–3;[286] both times they went on to win the competition. Another match that is often played in the European Cup/Champions League is Real Madrid vs Juventus, the most decorated Italian club. They have played each other in 21 matches and have an almost perfectly balanced record (nine wins for Juventus, ten wins for Real Madrid and two draws), as well as nearly the same goal difference (Madrid ahead 26 to 25).[287][288][289] Their first meeting was in the quarter-finals of the 1961–62 European Cup, which Real Madrid won 3–1 in a replay held in Paris.[288] At the quarter-final stage in 1995–96, Juventus prevailed 2–1 over the two legs and went on to lift the trophy.[288] In the 1998 UEFA Champions League Final between the teams in Amsterdam, Real Madrid won 1–0.[288][290] They met again in the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, when both clubs were in their respective 'golden eras'; Juventus won 4–3 on aggregate.[288] By that time, star midfielder Zinedine Zidane, who played for the Bianconeri in the 1998 final, had moved from Turin to Madrid in a world record €77 million deal.[291] The teams met again in the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League group stage, with Madrid winning 2–1 at home and drawing 2–2 away en route to their tenth title. In the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, former Real Madrid player Álvaro Morata scored one goal in each leg to take Juventus to the final, winning 3–2 on aggregate, while Cristiano Ronaldo scored both goals for Madrid.[288] They faced off again in the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final in Cardiff, with Ronaldo scoring twice as Real Madrid won 4–1.[288][292][293] The latest Champions League meeting was in the 2017–18 quarter-finals, which Real Madrid won 4–3 on aggregate; the tie ended in dramatic and controversial fashion, with a debatable penalty awarded to Real Madrid in the last minute of the second leg after Juventus built a 3–0 lead at the Bernabeu to pull level in the tie following a defeat at the Allianz Stadium by the same scoreline.[294][295] Cristiano Ronaldo scored three goals over the two matches including the decisive penalty and a spectacular overhead kick,[296] and having won the Champions League with Madrid for a fourth time,[297] he transferred to Juventus a few months later for a €117 million fee.[298] It was under Florentino Pérez's first presidency (2000–2006) that Real Madrid started its ambition of becoming the world's richest professional football club.[299] The club ceded part of its training grounds to the city of Madrid in 2001, and sold the rest to four corporations: Repsol YPF, Mutua Automovilística de Madrid, Sacyr Vallehermoso and OHL. The sale eradicated the club's debts, paving the way for it to buy the world's most expensive players, such as Zinedine Zidane, Luís Figo, Ronaldo and David Beckham. The city had previously rezoned the training grounds for development, a move which in turn increased their value, and then bought the site.[78] The European Commission started an investigation into whether the city overpaid for the property, to be considered a form of state subsidy.[300] The sale of the training ground for office buildings cleared Real Madrid's debts of €270 million and enabled the club to embark upon an unprecedented spending spree which brought big-name players to the club. In addition, profit from the sale was spent on a state-of-the-art training complex on the city's outskirts.[301] Although Pérez's policy resulted in increased financial success from the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, especially in Asia, it came under increasing criticism for being too focused on marketing the Real Madrid brand and not enough on the performances of the team.[81] By September 2007, Real Madrid was considered the most valuable football brand in Europe by BBDO. In 2008, it was ranked the second-most valuable club in world football, at €951 million (£640 million / $1.285 billion),[302] only beaten by Manchester United, which was valued at €1.333 billion (£900 million).[303] In 2010, Real Madrid had the highest turnover in football worldwide.[304] In September 2009, Real Madrid's management announced plans to open the club's own dedicated theme park by 2013.[305] A study at Harvard University concluded that Real Madrid \"is one of the 20 most important brand names and the only one in which its executives, the players, are well-known. We have some spectacular figures in regard to worldwide support of the club. There are an estimated 287 million people worldwide who follow Real Madrid.\"[306] In 2010, Forbes evaluated Real Madrid's worth to be around €992 million (US$1.323 billion), ranking them second only to Manchester United, based on figures from the 2008–09 season.[307][308] According to Deloitte, Real Madrid had a recorded revenue of €401 million in the same period, ranking first.[309] Along with Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao and Osasuna, Real Madrid is organised as a registered association. This means that the club is owned by its supporters, who elect the president. The president cannot invest his own money,[310] and the club can only spend what it earns, which is mainly derived through sponsorships, commercial partnerships, merchandise sales, television rights, prize money and ticket sales. Unlike a limited company, it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only a membership.[311] The members of Real Madrid, called \"socios\", form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club.[312] As of 2010, the club had 60,000 socios.[313] At the end of the 2009–10 season, the club's board of directors stated that Real Madrid had a net debt of €244.6 million, €82.1 million lower than the previous fiscal year. Real Madrid announced that it had a net debt of €170 million after the 2010–11 season. From 2007 to 2011, the club made a net profit of €190 million.[314][315] During the 2009–10 season, Real Madrid made €150 million through ticket sales, the most of any club in top-flight football.[314] Real Madrid has the highest number of shirt sales per season, around 1.5 million.[314] For the 2010–11 season, Madrid's wage bill totalled €169 million, which was second-highest in Europe behind Barcelona;[316] furthermore, its wage bill to turnover ratio was the best in Europe at 43 percent, ahead of Manchester United and Arsenal at 46 percent and 50 percent, respectively. In 2013, Forbes listed the club as the world's most valuable sports team, worth $3.3 billion.[317] Real Madrid was valued at €3.47 billion ($4.1 billion) in 2018, and in the 2016–17 season it was the second highest-earning football club in the world, with an annual revenue of €674.6 million.[318] In November 2018, the average first-team pay at Madrid was £8.1m ($10.6m) per year, making it the second-highest paid sports team in the world after Barcelona.[319][320] In 2022, Forbes listed Real Madrid as the most valuable football club in the world, at $5.1 billion.[321] Real Madrid was the featured club in the second installment of the Goal! football movie trilogy, Goal! 2: Living the Dream... (2007). The film follows former Newcastle United star Santiago Muñez as he is first scouted and then signed by Real Madrid for the 2005–06 season. The film's creators wanted to put emphasis on the changes in Muñez's life after his move to Madrid. Production was done with the full support of UEFA, allowing the film crew to use many real life players in cameo roles. Real Madrid squad members featured in the film included Iker Casillas, Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Raúl, Sergio Ramos, Robinho, Michael Owen, Míchel Salgado, Júlio Baptista, Steve McManaman and Iván Helguera. Non-Real Madrid players to make cameo appearances included Ronaldinho, Thierry Henry, Lionel Messi, Samuel Eto'o, Andrés Iniesta, Pablo Aimar, Freddie Ljungberg, Cesc Fàbregas and Santiago Cañizares. In the film, both Florentino Pérez and Alfredo Di Stéfano presented the fictional player Muñez to the club after his signing.[322] Real, The Movie is a 2005 part feature, part documentary film that showcases the worldwide passion for Real Madrid. Produced by the club and directed by Borja Manso, it follows five sub-stories of fans from around the world and their love for the club. Along with the fictional portion of the film, it also contains real footage of the squad, during training at Ciudad Real Madrid, matches, and interviews. Although the film mentions all of the squad, it mainly focuses on galácticos such as David Beckham, Zinedine Zidane, Raúl, Luís Figo, Ronaldo, Iker Casillas and Roberto Carlos, among others. The film was originally produced in Spanish, but has been dubbed for their worldwide fanbase. The book White Storm: 100 years of Real Madrid by Phil Ball was the first English-language history of Real Madrid. Published in 2002, it talks about the most successful moments of the club during its first centenary, having been translated into various languages. In late 2011, Real Madrid released a digital music album, entitled Legends, and a remix of the club's anthem, \"Himno del Real Madrid,\" was released as the first single from the album.[323] Real Madrid TV is an encrypted digital television channel, operated by Real Madrid and specialising in the club. The channel is available in Spanish and English. It is located at Ciudad Real Madrid in Valdebebas (Madrid), Real Madrid's training centre. Hala Madrid is a magazine published quarterly for the Real Madrid club members and the Madridistas Fan Club card holders.[324] The phrase Hala Madrid, meaning \"Forward Madrid\" or \"Go Madrid\", is also the title of the club's official anthem, which is often sung by the Madridistas (the club's fans).[6] The magazine includes reports on the club's matches in the previous month, as well as information about the reserve and youth teams. Features often include interviews with players, both past and present, and the club's historic matches.[324] Real Madrid has appeared in many football-based video games, namely in the FIFA and Pro Evolution Soccer series. A Real Madrid player has appeared on the cover of both titles a combined seven times. In 2007, Spanish game publisher Virgin Play signed a deal with the club to make officially licensed Real Madrid video games. The only one released under the deal (due to Virgin Play's liquidation in September 2009) would end up being Real Madrid: The Game, which was developed by Atomic Planet Entertainment and was published under Virgin Play's publishing division V.2 Play in May 2009 for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Windows, Wii and Nintendo DS exclusively in European territories Virgin Play released their products in. The game featured a career mode with a mixture of role-playing and simulation as well as arcade-styled Football gameplay. Spanish teams are limited to three players without EU citizenship. The squad list includes only the principal nationality of each player; several non-European players on the squad have dual citizenship with an EU country. Also, players from the ACP countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement are not counted against non-EU quotas due to the Kolpak ruling.

Real Madrid was officially founded in 1902, though its history can be traced back to 1897. It joined the Royal Spanish Football Federation in 1909. Real Madrid has won 15 European Cup/Champions League titles, far more than any other team. Real Madrid has won the Copa del Rey, Spain’s main football cup competition, 20 times. Real Madrid played at several venues until club president Santiago Bernabéu spearheaded the construction of the stadium that today bears his name. Opened in 1947, the Bernabéu holds more than 80,000 spectators. Real Madrid's biggest rivalry is with FC Barcelona. Matches between Barcelona and Real Madrid are known as El Clásico (“The Classic”). Real Madrid, Spanish professional football (soccer) club based in Madrid. Known for their all-white uniforms, which led to its nickname “Los Blancos,” Real Madrid is one of the world’s best-known teams. Real Madrid grew out of Football Club Sky, a team formed in Madrid in 1897. The club was officially founded in 1902 and joined the Royal Spanish Football Federation in 1909. Real Madrid played at a variety of venues until ambitious club president Santiago Bernabéu spearheaded the construction of the stadium that bears his name. Opened in 1947, the Bernabéu holds more than 80,000 spectators and was the venue for the 1982 Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup final. The European Cup was first held during the 1955–56 season, with a prestigious field consisting of clubs that had won their own country’s league championship. Real Madrid was the tournament’s first winner, defeating French club Stade de Reims in the final. It continued on a run of European dominance that no team has matched since. Gifted players such as Ferenc Puskás, Alfredo Di Stéfano, Paco Gento, Hector Rial, and Miguel Muñoz helped the club win the first five European Cups in a row. The club’s play in the 1960 European Cup final against the West German team Eintracht Frankfurt—a 7–3 Real victory—is widely considered one of the finest club performances of all time. Real has won a total of 15 European Cup/Champions League titles, far more than any other team. 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1966, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2022, 2024 Real Madrid has won more Spanish top-division (La Liga) championships (36) than any other Spanish side. The club has also won the Copa del Rey, the main Spanish cup competition, 20 times and the Supercopa de España (Spanish Super Cup) 13 times. It won UEFA Cup twice, in 1985 and 1986. Real’s local competition is Atlético Madrid, but the club’s biggest rivalry is with FC Barcelona. The tension between the football clubs from Spain’s two biggest cities was amplified by a struggle between the teams in the 1950s to sign Di Stéfano, who reneged on a proposed deal with Barcelona to sign with Madrid, helping Real become a football power in the 1950s and ’60s. Matches between Barcelona and Real Madrid are known as El Clásico (“The Classic”) and are watched throughout Spain, in large part because the two sides symbolize for many the ongoing political and cultural difficulties between Castilian (Real) and Catalonian (Barcelona) Spain. From the late 1990s Real Madrid spent enormous sums on luring some of the world’s most famous foreign players to the club, where they are known as galácticos (“superstars”). Those players were often the most expensive (by transfer fee) footballers in the world and included such stars as David Beckham, Luis Figo, Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane, Kaká, Cristiano Ronaldo, and James Rodriguez. Sergio Ramos and Iker Casillas are other notable players of this era. Following his departure from Paris Saint-Germain after the 2023–24 season, Kylian Mbappé joined Real Madrid.",

                "content": "The UEFA Champions League (abbreviated as UCL) is an annual club association football competition organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) that is contested by top-division European clubs. The competition begins with a round robin league phase to qualify for the double-legged knockout rounds, and a single-leg final. It is the most-watched club competition in the world and the third most-watched football competition overall, behind only the UEFA European Championship and the FIFA World Cup. It is one of the most prestigious football tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national league champions (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of their national associations. Introduced in 1955 as the Coupe des Clubs Champions Européens (French for European Champion Clubs' Cup), and commonly known as the European Cup, it was initially a straight knockout tournament open only to the champions of Europe's domestic leagues, with its winner reckoned as the European club champion. The competition took on its current name in 1992, adding a round-robin group stage in 1991 and allowing multiple entrants from certain countries since the 1997–98 season.[1] While only the winners of many of Europe's national leagues can enter the competition, the top 5 leagues by coefficient provide four teams each by default,[2] with a possibility for additional spots based on performance during the previous season.[3][4] Clubs that finish below the qualifying spots are eligible for the second-tier UEFA Europa League competition, and since 2021, for the third-tier UEFA Conference League.[5] In its present format, the Champions League begins in early July with three qualifying rounds and a play-off round, all played over two legs. The seven surviving teams enter the league phase, joining 29 teams qualified in advance. The 36 teams each play eight opponents, four home and four away. The 24 highest-ranked teams proceed to the knockout phase that culminates with the final match in late May or early June.[6] The winner of the Champions League automatically qualifies for the following year's Champions League, the UEFA Super Cup, the FIFA Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup.[7][8] Spanish clubs have the most victories (20 wins), followed by England (15 wins) and Italy (12 wins). England has the most winning teams, with six clubs having won the title. The competition has been won by 23 clubs and 13 of them have won it more than once.[9] Real Madrid is the most successful club in the tournament's history, having won it 15 times. Madrid is the only club to have won it five times in a row (the first five editions).[10] Only one club has won all of their matches in a single tournament en route to the tournament victory: Bayern Munich in the 2019–20 season.[11] Real Madrid is the current European champion, having beaten Borussia Dortmund 2–0 in the 2024 final for their fifteenth title. The first time the champions of two European leagues met was in what was nicknamed the 1895 World Championship, when English champions Sunderland beat Scottish champions Heart of Midlothian 5–3.[12] The first pan-European tournament was the Challenge Cup, a competition between clubs in the Austro-Hungarian Empire.[13] Three years later, in 1900, the champions of Belgium, Netherlands and Switzerland, which were the only existing leagues in continental Europe at the time, participated in the Coupe Van der Straeten Ponthoz, thus being dubbed as the \"club championship of the continent\" by the local newspapers.[14][15] The Mitropa Cup, a competition modelled after the Challenge Cup, was created in 1927, an idea of Austrian Hugo Meisl, and played between Central European clubs.[16] In 1930, the Coupe des Nations (French: Nations Cup), the first attempt to create a cup for national champion clubs of Europe, was played and organised by Swiss club Servette.[17] Held in Geneva, it brought together ten champions from across the continent. The tournament was won by Újpest of Hungary.[17] Latin European nations came together to form the Latin Cup in 1949.[18] After receiving reports from his journalists over the highly successful South American Championship of Champions of 1948, Gabriel Hanot, editor of L'Équipe, began proposing the creation of a continent-wide tournament.[19] In interviews, Jacques Ferran (one of the founders of the European Champions Cup, together with Gabriel Hanot),[20] said that the South American Championship of Champions was the inspiration for the European Champions Cup.[21] After Stan Cullis declared Wolverhampton Wanderers \"Champions of the World\" following a successful run of friendlies in the 1950s, in particular a 3–2 friendly victory against Budapest Honvéd, Hanot finally managed to convince UEFA to put into practice such a tournament.[1] It was conceived in Paris in 1955 as the European Champion Clubs' Cup.[1] The first European Cup took place during the 1955–56 season.[22][23] Sixteen teams participated (some by invitation): AC Milan (Italy), AGF Aarhus (Denmark), Anderlecht (Belgium), Djurgården (Sweden), Gwardia Warszawa (Poland), Hibernian (Scotland), Partizan (Yugoslavia), PSV Eindhoven (Netherlands), Rapid Wien (Austria), Real Madrid (Spain), Rot-Weiss Essen (West Germany), Saarbrücken (Saar), Servette (Switzerland), Sporting CP (Portugal), Reims (France) and Vörös Lobogó (Hungary).[22][23] The first European Cup match took place on 4 September 1955, and ended in a 3–3 draw between Sporting CP and Partizan.[22][23] The first goal in European Cup history was scored by João Baptista Martins of Sporting CP.[22][23] The inaugural final took place at the Parc des Princes between Stade de Reims and Real Madrid on 13 June 1956.[22][23][24] The Spanish squad came back from behind to win 4–3 thanks to goals from Alfredo Di Stéfano and Marquitos, as well as two goals from Héctor Rial.[22][23][24] Real Madrid successfully defended the trophy next season in their home stadium, the Santiago Bernabéu, against Fiorentina.[25][26] After a scoreless first half, Real Madrid scored twice in six minutes to defeat the Italians.[24][25][26] In 1958, Milan failed to capitalise after going ahead on the scoreline twice, only for Real Madrid to equalise.[27][28] The final, held in Heysel Stadium, went to extra time where Francisco Gento scored the game-winning goal to allow Real Madrid to retain the title for the third consecutive season.[24][27][28] In a rematch of the first final, Real Madrid faced Stade Reims at the Neckarstadion for the 1959 final, and won 2–0.[24][29][30] West German side Eintracht Frankfurt became the first team not to compete in the Latin cup to reach the European Cup final.[18][31][32] The 1960 final holds the record for the most goals scored, with Real Madrid beating Eintracht Frankfurt 7–3 at Hampden Park, courtesy of four goals by Ferenc Puskás and a hat-trick by Alfredo Di Stéfano.[24][31][32] This was Real Madrid's fifth consecutive title, a record that still stands today.[9] Real Madrid's reign ended in the 1960–61 season when bitter rivals Barcelona dethroned them in the first round.[33][34] Barcelona were defeated in the final by Portuguese side Benfica 3–2 at the Wankdorf Stadium.[33][34][35] Reinforced by Eusébio, Benfica defeated Real Madrid 5–3 at the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam and kept the title for a second consecutive season.[35][36][37] Benfica wanted to repeat Real Madrid's successful run of the 1950s after reaching the showpiece event of the 1962–63 European Cup, but a brace from Brazilian-Italian José Altafini at Wembley gave the spoils to Milan, making the trophy leave the Iberian Peninsula for the first time ever.[38][39][40] Inter Milan beat an ageing Real Madrid 3–1 at the Ernst-Happel-Stadion to win the 1963–64 season and replicate their local-rival's success.[41][42][43] The title stayed in Milan for the third year in a row after Inter beat Benfica 1–0 at their home ground, the San Siro.[44][45][46] Under the leadership of Jock Stein, Scottish club Celtic beat Inter Milan 2–1 in the 1967 final to become the first British club to win the European Cup.[47][48] The Celtic players that day, all of whom were born within 30 miles (48 km) of Glasgow, subsequently became known as the \"Lisbon Lions\".[49] The 1967–68 season saw Manchester United become the first English team to win the European Cup, beating two-times winners Benfica 4–1 in the final.[50] This final came ten years after the Munich air disaster, which had claimed the lives of eight United players and left their manager, Matt Busby, fighting for his life.[51] In the 1968–69 season, Ajax became the first Dutch team to reach the European Cup final, but they were beaten 4–1 by Milan, who claimed their second European Cup, with Pierino Prati scoring a hat-trick.[52] The 1969–70 season saw the first Dutch winners of the competition. Feyenoord knocked out the defending champions, Milan in the second round,[53] before beating Celtic in the final.[54] In the 1970–71 season, Ajax won the title, beating Greek side Panathinaikos in the final.[55] the season saw a number of changes, with penalty shoot-outs being introduced, and the away goals rule being changed so that it would be used in all rounds except the final.[56] It was also the first time a Greek team reached the final, as well as the first season that Real Madrid failed to qualify, having finished sixth in La Liga the previous season.[57] Ajax went on to win the competition three years in row (1971 to 1973), which Bayern Munich emulated from 1974 to 1976, before Liverpool won their first two titles in 1977 and 1978.[58] The following seasons saw victories in 1978–79 and 1979–80 for Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest. The following year Liverpool won their third title before Aston Villa continued the sense of English dominance in 1982. In 1982–83, Hamburger SV broke the English dominance. Liverpool regained it in 1983–84 before losing to Juventus (1984–85); Steaua București then won in 1985–86, Porto in 1986–87, PSV Eindhoven in 1987–88; Milan (2), Red Star Belgrade and Barcelona became champions before the competition was re-formulated as the UEFA Champions League. All English clubs were banned for five years (Liverpool for six years) following the 1985 European Cup final due to the Heysel Stadium disaster. \"Magic...it's magic above all else. When you hear the anthem it captivates you straight away.\" The UEFA Champions League anthem, officially titled simply as \"Champions League\", was written by Tony Britten, and is an adaptation of George Frideric Handel's 1727 anthem Zadok the Priest (one of his Coronation Anthems).[60][61] UEFA commissioned Britten in 1992 to arrange an anthem, and the piece was performed by London's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and sung by the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields.[60] Stating that \"the anthem is now almost as iconic as the trophy\", UEFA's official website adds it is \"known to set the hearts of many of the world's top footballers aflutter\".[60] The chorus contains the three official languages used by UEFA: English, German, and French.[62] The climactic moment is set to the exclamations 'Die Meister! Die Besten! Les Grandes Équipes! The Champions!'.[63] The anthem's chorus is played before each UEFA Champions League game as the two teams are lined up, as well as at the beginning and end of television broadcasts of the matches. In addition to the anthem, there is also entrance music, which contains parts of the anthem itself, which is played as teams enter the field.[64] The complete anthem is about three minutes long, and has two short verses and the chorus.[62] Special vocal versions have been performed live at the Champions League final with lyrics in other languages, changing over to the host nation's language for the chorus. These versions were performed by Andrea Bocelli (Italian; Rome 2009, Milan 2016 and Cardiff 2017), Juan Diego Flores (Spanish; Madrid 2010), All Angels (Wembley 2011), Jonas Kaufmann and David Garrett (Munich 2012) and Mariza (Lisbon 2014). In the 2013 final at Wembley, the chorus was played twice. In the 2018 and 2019 finals, held in Kyiv and Madrid respectively, the instrumental version of the chorus was played, by 2Cellos (2018) and Asturia Girls (2019).[65][66] In the 2023 final, held in Istanbul, Hungarian pianist Ádám György performed the piano version of the anthem.[67] The anthem has been released commercially in its original version on iTunes and Spotify with the title of Champions League Theme. In 2018, composer Hans Zimmer remixed the anthem with rapper Vince Staples for EA Sports' video game FIFA 19, with it also featuring in the game's reveal trailer.[68] In 1991, UEFA asked its commercial partner, Television Event and Media Marketing (TEAM), to help brand the Champions League. This resulted in the anthem, \"house colours\" of black and white or silver and a logo, and the \"starball\". The starball was created by Design Bridge, a London-based firm selected by TEAM after a competition.[69] TEAM gives particular attention to detail in how the colours and starball are depicted at matches. According to TEAM, \"Irrespective of whether you are a spectator in Moscow or Milan, you will always see the same stadium dressing materials, the same opening ceremony featuring the 'starball' centre circle ceremony, and hear the same UEFA Champions League Anthem\". Based on research it conducted, TEAM concluded that by 1999, \"the starball logo had achieved a recognition rate of 94 percent among fans\".[70] The UEFA Champions League used to begin with a double round-robin group stage of 32 teams until it evolved into a league phase of 36 teams, which is preceded by two qualification 'streams' for teams that do not receive direct entry to the tournament proper. The two streams are divided between teams qualified by virtue of being league champions, and those qualified by virtue of finishing second, third or fourth in their national championship. The number of teams that each association enters into the UEFA Champions League is based upon the UEFA coefficients of the member associations. These coefficients are generated by the results of clubs representing each association during the previous five Champions League, Europa League and Conference League seasons. The higher an association's coefficient, the more teams represent the association in the Champions League, and the fewer qualification rounds the association's teams must compete in. Five of the remaining seven qualifying places are granted to the winners of a four-round qualifying tournament between the remaining 43 or 44 national champions, within which those champions from associations with higher coefficients receive byes to later rounds. The other two are granted to the winners of a three-round qualifying tournament between ten and eleven clubs from the associations ranked 5–6 through 15, which have qualified based upon finishing second, third or fourth in their respective national league. In addition to sporting criteria, any club must be licensed by its national association to participate in the Champions League. To obtain a license, the club must meet certain stadium, infrastructure and finance requirements. In 2005–06, Liverpool and Artmedia Bratislava became the first teams to reach the Champions League group stage after playing in all three qualifying rounds. Real Madrid and Barcelona hold the record for the most appearances in the group stage, having qualified 25 times, followed by Porto and Bayern Munich on 24.[71] Between 1999 and 2008, no differentiation was made between champions and non-champions in qualification. The 16 top-ranked teams spread across the biggest domestic leagues qualified directly for the tournament group stage. Prior to this, three preliminary knockout qualifying rounds whittled down the remaining teams, with teams starting in different rounds. An exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions League the year before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers.[72] UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that, if the Champions League winner fell outside of its domestic league's top four, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league. Until 2015–16, no association could have more than four entrants in the Champions League.[73] In May 2012, Tottenham Hotspur finished fourth in the 2011–12 Premier League, two places ahead of Chelsea, but failed to qualify for the 2012–13 Champions League, after Chelsea won the 2012 final.[74] Tottenham were demoted to the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League.[74] In May 2013,[75] it was decided that, starting from the 2015–16 season (and continuing at least for the three-year cycle until the 2017–18 season), the winners of the previous season's UEFA Europa League would qualify for the UEFA Champions League, entering at least the play-off round, and entering the group stage if the berth reserved for the Champions League title holders was not used. The previous limit of a maximum of four teams per association was increased to five, meaning that a fourth-placed team from one of the top three ranked associations would only have to be moved to the Europa League if both the Champions League and Europa League winners came from that association and both finished outside the top four of their domestic league.[76] In 2007, Michel Platini, the UEFA president, had proposed taking one place from the three leagues with four entrants and allocating it to that nation's cup winners. This proposal was rejected in a vote at a UEFA Strategy Council meeting.[77] In the same meeting, however, it was agreed that the third-placed team in the top three leagues would receive automatic qualification for the group stage, rather than entry into the third qualifying round, while the fourth-placed team would enter the play-off round for non-champions, guaranteeing an opponent from one of the top 15 leagues in Europe. This was part of Platini's plan to increase the number of teams qualifying directly into the group stage, while simultaneously increasing the number of teams from lower-ranked nations in the group stage.[78] In 2012, Arsène Wenger referred to qualifying for the Champions League by finishing in the top four places in the Premier League as the \"4th Place Trophy\". The phrase was coined after a pre-match conference when he was questioned about Arsenal's lack of a trophy after exiting the FA Cup. He said \"The first trophy is to finish in the top four\".[79] At Arsenal's 2012 AGM, Wenger was also quoted as saying: \"For me there are five trophies every season: Premier League, Champions League, the third is to qualify for the Champions League...\"[80] Beginning with the 2024–25 season, UEFA changed the format of their three club competitions, abandoning the group stage in favour of an expanded league phase.[81] The number of participating teams was increased from 32 to 36 teams. Teams are no longer divided into groups of four teams each but are ranked in a single table. Each team plays eight matches against eight different opponents. For the draw of the league phase, teams are divided into four seeding pots according to their UEFA coefficient. Each team will play against two teams from each pot, one home and one away. The league phase is played from September to January, while the knockout phase begins in February, with matches predominantly played on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. After the league phase, a two-legged knockout play-off round is played between teams finishing 9–16 (seeded) and 17–24 (unseeded) in the league phase. Teams finishing in the top eight of the league phase receive a bye to the round of 16 as seeded teams, while the eight winning teams from the knockout play-off round will enter the round of 16 draw as unseeded teams. Teams finishing 25th–36th place in the league phase and the eight losers of the knockout play-offs are eliminated from the competition and from European football since it is no longer possible to enter the Europa League from the league phase onwards. After the round of 16 the competition follows the traditional knockout format with quarter-finals, semi-finals (both two legged and without association draw protection) and then the final at a venue chosen prior to the season. The final is typically held in late May or early June. Prior to the 2024–25 season, the tournament proper began with a group stage of 32 teams, divided into eight groups of four.[82] The draw to determine which teams entered each group was seeded based on each team's UEFA coefficient, and no group could contain more than one club from each association. Each team played six group stage games, meeting the other three teams in its group home and away in a round-robin format.[82] The first place team and the runners-up from each group then progressed to the next round. The third-placed teams entered the Europa League's knockout round and the fourth-placed teams were eliminated from the competition. For the next stage – the last 16 – the winning team from one group played against the runners-up from another group, but teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other (see random two-sided matching). From the quarter-finals onwards, the draw was entirely random, without association protection.[83] The group stage was played from September to December, whilst the knockout stage began in February, with matches usually played on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. The knockout ties were played in a two-legged format, with the exception of the final. In the 2019–20 season, due to the COVID-19 pandemic the tournament was suspended for five months. The format of the remainder of the tournament was temporarily amended as a result, with the quarter-finals and semi-finals being played as single match knockout ties at neutral venues in Lisbon, Portugal in the summer with the final taking place on 23 August 2020.[84] The following is the default access list. Changes will be made to the access list above if the Champions League or Europa League title holders qualify for the tournament via their domestic leagues. Each year, the winning team is presented with the European Champion Clubs' Cup, the current version of which has been awarded since 1967. From the 1968–69 season and prior to the 2008–09 season any team that won the Champions League three years in a row or five times overall was awarded the official trophy permanently.[86] Each time a club achieved this, a new official trophy had to be forged for the following season.[87] Five clubs own a version of the official trophy: Real Madrid, Ajax, Bayern Munich, Milan and Liverpool.[86] Since 2008, the official trophy has remained with UEFA and the clubs are awarded a replica.[86] The current trophy is 74 cm (29 in) tall and made of silver, weighing 11 kg (24 lb). It was designed by Jürg Stadelmann, a jeweller from Bern, Switzerland, after the original was given to Real Madrid in 1966 in recognition of their six titles to date, and cost 10,000 Swiss francs. As of the 2012–13 season, 40 gold medals are presented to the Champions League winners, and 40 silver medals to the runners-up.[88] Starting with the 2024–25 season, the distribution of the prize money is as follows.[89] A large part of the distributed revenue from the UEFA Champions League is linked to the \"market pool\", the distribution of which is determined by the value of the television market in each nation. For the 2019–20 season, Paris Saint-Germain, who were the runners-up, earned nearly €126.8 million in total, of which €101.3 million was prize money, compared with the €125.46 million earned by Bayern Munich, who won the tournament and were awarded €112.96 million in prize money.[90] Like the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA Champions League is sponsored by a group of multinational corporations, in contrast to the single main sponsor typically found in national top-flight leagues. When the Champions League was created in 1992, it was decided that a maximum of eight companies should be allowed to sponsor the event, with each corporation being allocated four advertising boards around the perimeter of the pitch, as well as logo placement at pre- and post-match interviews and a certain number of tickets to each match. This, combined with a deal to ensure tournament sponsors were given priority on television advertisements during matches, ensured that each of the tournament's main sponsors was given maximum exposure.[91] From the 2012–13 knockout phase, UEFA used LED advertising hoardings installed in knockout participant stadiums, including the final. From the 2015–16 season onwards, UEFA has used such hoardings from the play-off round until the final.[92] Since 2021, the UEFA also used Virtual Board Replacement (VBR) technology to offer region-based advertising; regional sponsors are inserted into the hoardings as shown on the broadcast feed in specific regions along with the global sponsors.[93][94] Individual clubs may wear jerseys with advertising. However, only two sponsorships are permitted per jersey in addition to that of the kit manufacturer, at the chest and the left sleeve.[95] Exceptions are made for non-profit organisations, which can feature on the front of the shirt, incorporated with the main sponsor or in place of it; or on the back, either below the squad number or on the collar area.[96] If a club plays a match in a nation where the relevant sponsorship category is restricted (such as France's alcohol advertising restriction), then they must remove that logo from their jerseys. For example, when Rangers played French side Auxerre in the 1996–97 Champions League, they wore the logo of the holiday chain Center Parcs instead of their primary sponsor, McEwan's Lager (both companies at the time were subsidiaries of Scottish & Newcastle).[97] The tournament's main sponsors for the 2024–27 cycle are: Adidas is a secondary sponsor and supplies the official match ball, while Macron supplies the referee kits.[107] The competition attracts an extensive television audience, not just in Europe, but throughout the world. The final of the tournament has been, in recent years, the most-watched annual sporting event in the world.[108] The final of the 2012–13 tournament had the competition's highest TV ratings to date, drawing approximately 360 million television viewers.[109] Notes Players that are still active in Europe are highlighted in boldface. The table below does not include appearances made in the qualification stage of the competition. Starting from the 2021–22 edition, UEFA introduced the UEFA Champions League Player of the Season award. The jury is composed of the coaches of the clubs that participated in the group stage of the competition, as well as 55 journalists selected by the European Sports Media (ESM) group, one from each UEFA member association. In the same season, UEFA also introduced the UEFA Champions League Young Player of the Season award.",

                "content": "Manage your account Strong winds continue to fuel the fast-moving, 3,000-acre Malibu wildfire that has destroyed homes and forced authorities to issue evacuation orders to around 20,000 people in Los Angeles County, California. The National Weather Service in Los Angeles warned Tuesday night there remained a \"very extreme fire danger\" across southern California as thousands of first responders worked to control the flames. Evacuees from Malibu include several famous figures who live in the sought-after beachside community. Actor Dick Van Dyke, who turns 99 on Friday, wrote on Facebook that he and his wife Arlene escaped safely on Tuesday with their animals, except a cat named Bobo. Singer Cher also evacuated to a hotel Monday night along with her pets, publicist Liz Rosenberg confirmed to the New York Times. Students at Pepperdine University in Malibu have spoken of the terrifying ordeal of being told to shelter-in-place in the campus library and other buildings, while watching flames spreading nearby. \"We were supposed to be taking finals this week and with the students that I talked to, we’d much rather be taking finals than living through this experience,\" Rachel Flynn, a Pepperdine senior, told NBC Los Angeles. \"Tonight, it’s on Dresher Hill, which is the opposite side of campus than it was last night,\" she said. \"So, that’s definitely concerning for me because that’s where my dorm is located. That’s where my car is parked. I’m watching the flames expand and grow.\" Resigned to their temporary home, Flynn said some had put couches together as makeshift beds. The fire covered 4.5 miles early Wednesday, covering the Santa Monica Mountains Recreation Area in the east and stretching to central Malibu and large beachside properties. There were more than 1,500 firefighters and multiple agencies tackling the blaze Tuesday night. Cpt. Jennifer Seetoo of Los Angeles County Sheriffs told a news conference Tuesday night: \"Fire can be extremely unpredictable and we highly encourage residents in the fire areas to be prepared, have a plan and heed our evacuation warnings and orders.\" She added that deputies would be available to patrol areas where homes, some owned by famous and wealthy residents, had been evacuated. \"We will not tolerate anyone coming to this community to re-victimize our community members,\" she said. There have been no reports of deaths or injuries, but more than 8,000 properties are in the affected areas and at least seven have been destroyed. The cause of the fire is unknown and remains under investigation. Local photographer Tim Horton, who lives on the Pepperdine campus, posted images of a Chinook helicopter picking up water from a lake and dropping it on the fire, pine trees on fire, and flames coming within a few feet of his apartment. Michael Friel, director of communications at the college, said the sheltering students had food, water and power to charge their phones. Power outages were affecting more than 45,000 energy customers in the region, according to PowerOutage.us, but some Pepperdine buildings are powered by generators. Pepperdine said in a social media post early Wednesday that fire activity surrounding the college had \"greatly diminished as the Franklin Fire has burned through most of the fuel immediately surrounding campus.\" A mandatory evacuation order is in place for areas east of Latino Canyon, west of Topanga Beach Driveway ad south of Baller Motorway, including the Big Rock and Las Flores Communities. All Malibu schools will be closed Wednesday and Thursday, but are expected to be open Friday. Some 12 million people were covered by red flag warnings on Tuesday, as strong Santa Ana winds of more than 60 mph and dry undergrowth created the perfect conditions for fire to start and move quickly.

                "content": "Celebrities have been forced to flee their Malibu homes because of the Franklin Fire, which has been raging for days. The fire ignited on Monday night after days of extremely dangerous conditions when Santa Ana winds whipped across the region. Mandatory evacuation orders are in place east of Malibu Canyon Road, south of Piuma Road and in the Serra Retreat area. A spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Fire Department previously told Newsweek that in the 12 hours since it ignited, the fire exploded to 2,200 acres. As of Wednesday morning, it has grown to more than 3,000 acres. As many celebrities live in Malibu, their homes are at risk. Those who have been forced to evacuate include Dick Van Dyke and Cher. At the time of writing, it is unclear how many other stars who call Malibu home—including Barbra Streisand, Julia Roberts, Lady Gaga, Beyoncé and Jay-Z—have also had to flee. Newsweek contacted spokespeople for Van Dyke, Cher, Streisand, Roberts, Lady Gaga and Beyoncé for comment by email on Tuesday outside normal business hours. Van Dyke, whose 99th birthday is on Friday, said in a Facebook post on Tuesday that he and his wife, Arlene Silver, had evacuated their home while the Franklin Fire raged on. He added that one of their cats was missing. \"Arlene and I have safely evacuated with our animals except for Bobo escaped as we were leaving. We're praying he'll be OK and that our community in Serra Retreat will survive these terrible fires,\" he wrote. In a brief phone call with The New York Times, Liz Rosenberg, Cher's publicist, confirmed that the singer and her pets had moved to a hotel on Monday night. A spokesperson for Streisand said they were waiting to ascertain the star's whereabouts. She resides in Malibu with her husband, fellow actor James Brolin. Their home is a 10,000-square-foot compound comprising four buildings on 3 acres of property. English actor Jane Seymour took to Instagram on Tuesday to say she had evacuated her home in the fire-ravaged area. \"The fires in our community are a stark reminder of how quickly life can change. Thankfully, my family and I were able to evacuate safely, but my thoughts are with everyone who is still in harm's way, the brave firefighters risking everything to protect us, and the many who call Malibu home,\" she wrote alongside photos of the encroaching fire. \"Let's continue to support each other, stay informed, and remain hopeful. Our community is strong, and together we'll see through these challenging times,\" Seymour added. Newsweek contacted a spokesperson for Seymour for comment via email. Married couple Beyoncé and Jay-Z purchased their almost $200 million Malibu mansion in 2023, the most expensive home in California history, Architectural Digest reported. Their home is in Paradise Cove, which is in the Franklin Fire evacuation warning area. They live there with their three children: Blue Ivy and twins Rumi and Sir. Lady Gaga also lives in an evacuation zone, in a home in Zuma Beach. The Grammy-winning musician purchased the property, which is more than 10,000 square feet, in 2014 and has resided there since. According to Architectural Digest, Roberts owns a home in Malibu's Point Dume neighborhood, west of the raging flames. The Pretty Woman star has lived in the city since 2003. The outlet also reported that 21 Jump Street actor Jonah Hill bought a home in the Malibu Colony enclave in 2022. The neighborhood is included in the mandatory evacuation orders prompted by the Franklin Fire. Newsweek contacted a spokesperson for Hill for comment via email. While the worst of the winds may have passed, a risk of the fire spreading continues.

                "title": "\n    Franklin Fire in Malibu scorches 3,000 acres near Pepperdine University amid dangerous winds, forcing evacuations - CBS Los Angeles",
                "content": "Watch CBS News By Dean Fioresi, Chelsea Hylton, Julie Sharp, Matthew Rodriguez Updated on: December 10, 2024 / 10:31 PM PST / KCAL News The Franklin Fire in Malibu exploded overnight near the Pepperdine University campus, burning more than 3,000 acres and forcing thousands of people to evacuate the area. In a news conference Tuesday, county officials said that based on preliminary reports the fire destroyed seven structures and damaged another eight. The massive fire was first reported a little after 10:50 p.m. Monday near South Malibu Canyon Road and Station Boundary just south of the Piuma area, according to the Los Angeles County Fire Department. Around 4:40 p.m. Tuesday, it was estimated to be 3,049 acres by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire. Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said Tuesday that approximately 18,000 people and 8,100 structures are in the affected area. Of the 8,100 structures, 2,043 are under evacuation orders and 6,046 are under evacuation warnings. Los Angeles County Fire Department Chief Anthony Marrone said a 5-acre blaze that began on Malibu Canyon Road was quickly spread by Santa Ana winds. The flames rapidly spread towards Pepperdine University overnight. By 3 a.m., the Franklin Fire spread south across Pacific Coast Highway to Malibu Road, near Webb Way. It moved toward the Malibu Pier area and threatened some nearby structures along Malibu Knolls Road and the Sweetwater Mesa area. Matt Myerhoff, a spokesperson for the city of Malibu, said early Tuesday morning that the pier is safe. \"I think the preponderance of structures being impacted around here are going to be homes,\" he said. \"We don't have information yet if they are damaged or if they are destroyed, that's too soon to say ... we just know fire crews are battling those.\" Marrone said Tuesday that there are no reports of serious injuries or fatalities, but he warned the fire is not contained. \"We remain under immediate threat because of the Red Flag conditions,\" he said. \"We would like to get some containment by this afternoon.\" Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Tuesday that the state secured a Fire Management Assistance Grant from FEMA to ensure resources are available to help fight the blaze. Arson investigators are looking into the cause of the fire. RELATED: What is defensible space and how to protect your home from wildfires Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department deputies were working to evacuate residents living in zone MAL-C112, which includes the area east of Malibu Canyon Road and South of Piuma Road as well as the Serra Retreat. More information on evacuations is available on the Malibu city website. A list of shelters for displaced residents and animals: Malibu city officials established an emergency station at Zuma Beach, to help impacted residents with updates, food, water and first aid. Officials closed the Pacific Palisades Recreation Center off Alma Real Drive \"The way evacuations are conducted by the Sheriff's department is they go door to door. They drive up and down the streets with a blowhorn and they knock on every single door. They wake people up and get them out of their houses,\" Myerhoff said. He said using lessons learned from the 2018 Woolsey Fire, first responders are communicating by way of LA-RICS radios that the city purchased, as power outages affect cell phone service and all other forms of communication. \"We are safe. All retreats evacuated safely,\" the Serra Retreat said. \"Looks like the fire is on the retreat center property but there are several fire trucks there. Hopefully, they can contain it. \" A resident named Linda said her boss' house was destroyed while she was trying to evacuate horses. \"It's happening so quickly,\" she said. \"I'm worried about two horses that I left in there. I know the house is gone. I went back in there to find the two horses but it was too dangerous.\" Malibu City Hall, parks, and facilities are closed Tuesday, with all programs and meetings suspended, according to the city of Malibu. Below is a real-time map outlining evacuation orders and warnings. A temporary evacuation center was opened as the Palisades Recreation Center, located at 851 Alma Real Drive. Large animals could be taken to Pierce College in Winnetka. \"Stay away from the Malibu area, if you can, at all costs,\" Deputy Tracy Koerner said. \"Avoid coming into Malibu. A lot of people commute through Malibu from Ventura and Santa Monica, those people need to stay on the 101 Freeway today.\" Pepperdine school officials released a statement to note that they were closely monitoring the fire. \"The fire is not currently affecting any University campus,\" the statement said. \"The Malibu Campus and local area may experience some power outages related to this incident.\" However, at 1:10 a.m. the fire continued to crawl closer and closer to the university, forcing the administration to issue a shelter-in-place order. \"All community members on the Malibu campus are directed to shelter in place in the Tyler Campus Center or Payson Library,\" the administration posted on X. \"Despite any evacuation orders from Malibu city or surrounding areas, the University community should follow University instructions.\" The administration stated that their \"protocol is approved by LA County Fire and executed with their cooperation.\" Pepperdine canceled all classes and finals for Tuesday following the fire. \"Normal operations on the Malibu Campus are suspended for Tuesday. This includes canceling classes and finals for the day,\" the university tweeted. The worst of the fire pushed past Pepperdine by 3:30 a.m., but some smaller blazes continued to burn around the campus. The hotspots did not threaten structures or lives, according to the administration. \"Additionally, power remains out for much of Malibu and therefore, to ensure the safety of our community, we will maintain the shelter-in-place protocol until at least daylight,\" the university posted on X. \"The EOC will continue to update the community.\" The school lifted the shelter-in-place order around 7:30 a.m. Tuesday. \"After assessing campus conditions at daybreak, the EOC is lifting the shelter-in-place protocol. Campus conditions are safe for members of the community to return to student residences and on-campus homes,\" the university wrote. However, Pepperdine reactivated the shelter-in-place order at 4:30 p.m. Tuesday. Power remained out for much of the campus, and students were advised to not use elevators. The Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District announced that all Malibu schools are closed until Dec. 12. \"Authorities are urging residents and visitors to stay clear of the area, as the fire continues to pose a significant threat,\" Superintendent, Dr. Antonio Shelton wrote in a community announcement. The closures will affect Webster Elementary, Malibu Elementary, Malibu Middle and Malibu High School. All of the Santa Monica schools will remain open. \"At this time, many Webster families are under evacuation orders, and several families in other Malibu neighborhoods are under evacuation watch due to the Franklin Fire. Our district's Emergency Operations Center (EOC) is closely monitoring the situation, and we are prepared to respond as conditions evolve.\" The Los Angeles Unified School District, with schools in the neighboring Topanga and Pacific Palisades area, said schools are open and they are \"closely monitoring the Franklin Fire and its potential impact on our communities.\" Southern California Edison reported that there are 11,555 customers in Los Angeles County without power due to public safety power shutoffs. Another 38,051 customers in the county are under consideration for shutoffs. The city of Malibu said it has deployed changeable message signs, and backup generators to keep traffic signals on PCH operating. The city also advised, that should the power go out, and because of spotty cell service, residents can monitor local AM and FM radio, and 99.1 FM KBUU for emergency information. Weather officials raised concerns over fire danger that would impact most of Southern California. Unusually low humidity paired with a powerful Santa Ana winds movement created dangerous conditions, which led them to issue a \"particularly dangerous situation red flag warning\" beginning Monday night. In response, SoCal Edison warned tens of thousands of residents living throughout Los Angeles County that their service may be shut off if the winds intensify. Tuesday morning, winds in Malibu were gusting 40 mph, with peak winds expected from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. Tuesday. KCAL News meteorologist Paul Deanno said while the strongest winds are expected around 7 a.m., the fire danger remains high even after the worst of the winds have passed because of low humidity. Conditions are similar to the weather when the Mountain Fire erupted in Ventura County in early November. That blaze torched nearly 20,000 acres and destroyed more than 200 structures.

                "content": "28 Years Later is an upcoming post-apocalyptic horror film produced and directed by Danny Boyle from a screenplay by Alex Garland. It is the third installment in the 28 Days Later film series, following 28 Days Later (2002) and 28 Weeks Later (2007). It stars Jodie Comer, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Ralph Fiennes, with Cillian Murphy reprising his role from the first film. Produced by Columbia Pictures[3] in association with the British Film Institute, Decibel Films, and DNA Films, 28 Years Later marks the returns of Boyle and Garland as director and writer after they served only as executive producers on the second film. It is scheduled to be released in the United States by Sony Pictures Releasing on 20 June 2025. It was shot back-to-back with its sequel 28 Years Later Part II: The Bone Temple, which will be directed by Nia DaCosta, written and produced by Boyle and Garland, and starring Murphy. \"It’s been almost three decades since the rage virus escaped a biological weapons laboratory, and now, still in a ruthlessly enforced quarantine, some have found ways to exist amidst the infected. One such group of survivors lives on a small island connected to the mainland by a single, heavily-defended causeway. When one of the group leaves the island on a mission into the dark heart of the mainland, he discovers secrets, wonders, and horrors that have mutated not only the infected but other survivors as well.\"[4] In June 2007, Fox Atomic confirmed development on a third 28 Days Later film, dependent upon the financial performance of 28 Weeks Later following its home video release.[5] In July of the same year, Danny Boyle said that the story for a third installment had been mapped out.[6] By October 2010, Alex Garland stated that due to differences involving the film rights, the project had been delayed.[7] In January 2011, Boyle stated that he believed the project would be realised, stating confirming further developments for the story.[8] By April 2013, however, the filmmaker expressed uncertainty as to whether the movie would be made.[9] In January 2015, Garland addressed the project's status, confirming that while it had fallen into development hell there were serious discussions going on behind the scenes to produce the project. Reiterating that development was progressing, stating that the script he was working on would tentatively be titled 28 Months Later.[10] In June 2019, Boyle confirmed that he and Garland had been working on the third installment.[11] In March 2020, Imogen Poots expressed interest in reprising her role from the second film,[12] followed by Cillian Murphy in May 2021.[13] In November 2022, Boyle, Garland and actor Murphy all indicated their interest in making a sequel to 28 Days Later.[14] In June 2023, Boyle and Garland expressed in collaboration their intentions to \"seriously\" and \"diligently\" see the project enter production; while announcing that the script was now titled 28 Years Later, acknowledging the years it had taken to be developed. Boyle stated that he would like to serve as director, unless Garland chooses to.[15] By July of the same year, Murphy stated that he had recently discussed the possibility of a third film with Boyle; once again expressing interest in reprising his role if Boyle and Garland return to the franchise in their creative roles.[16] In January 2024, it was announced that a third film titled 28 Years Later was officially in development; with plans for the project to be the first of a new trilogy of sequels. Danny Boyle will direct the first installment, with a script written by Alex Garland; while the latter will also write the scripts for each of planned sequels. Boyle, Garland, Andrew Macdonald, and Peter Rice will serve as producers.[17][18] In February of the same year, Murphy discussed his potential involvement with the project; that same month, MacDonald had bought back the rights to the first film from Searchlight Pictures, promptly selling it to Sony Pictures for future distribution, as well as rights to future sequels.[a][19][20][21] In March 2024, Garland confirmed that he is writing a trilogy of sequel films.[22] The following month, the writer stated that the film Kes was a major influence on his work for 28 Years Later.[23] Murphy was revealed as an executive producer later that month.[24] In April, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Jodie Comer and Ralph Fiennes were cast to star it,[25] with Jack O'Connell joining the cast,[26] and Murphy being confirmed to reprise his role as Jim.[27] Erin Kellyman would be added to the cast in June.[28] Principal photography began on 7 May 2024, in Northumberland,[29][30] with Anthony Dod Mantle serving as the cinematographer.[31] Filming wrapped on 29 July.[32] The film was notably shot on an iPhone 15 Pro Max with the aid of numerous specialised attachments.[33] Filming mainly took place in the north of England, in the North East and Yorkshire and the Humber regions. Locations include Holy Island (Lindisfarne) off the Northumberland Coast, Hexham, Bellingham, Kielder Forest, Rothbury (Northumberland), Newcastle upon Tyne (Tyne and Wear), Waskerley (County Durham), Melsonby, Ripon , Fountains Abbey, Aysgarth Falls, Redmire (North Yorkshire) and Bradford (West Yorkshire).[34][35][36][37][38] Some scenes were filmed at Plankey Mill Farm, near Langley and Bardon Mill (Northumberland).[35] In addition, some filming took place in Cheddar Gorge in Somerset in South West England.[39] 28 Years Later is scheduled to be released in the United Kingdom, United States and Canada by Sony Pictures Releasing on 20 June 2025.[40] The first trailer was released on 10 December 2024. It features the 1903 poem \"Boots\" by Rudyard Kipling, recited by American actor Taylor Holmes in 1915. The trailer became #1 trending on Youtube. Stuart Heritage, the film critic for the The Guardian, commented \"As of now, though, it’s just about the most exciting film of 2025. And this is entirely down to its trailer.\"[41][42] In April 2024, Nia DaCosta entered early negotiations to direct the second film in the new trilogy of sequels, with Boyle, Garland, Andrew Macdonald, Peter Rice, and Bernie Bellew attached as producers.[43] The following month, DaCosta was confirmed to have signed onto the project as director. The movie is filming back-to-back with 28 Years Later,[43] with principal photography beginning on 19 August 2024.[44] The film's title was revealed as 28 Years Later Part II: The Bone Temple.[45]",

                "content": "Your changes have been saved Email is sent Email has already been sent You’ve reached your account maximum for followed topics. 28 Days Later is a film I hold near and dear to my heart. Danny Boyle’s horror classic came onto the scene in 2002 and single-handedly revitalized zombie cinema with its lo-fi approach to the end of the world, turning lumbering undead corpses into ferocious monsters willing to run marathons in pursuit of human flesh. Creatures driven by nothing but pure, unbridled Rage. It terrified, intrigued, and inspired me as a child, and two decades later it still does. Naturally, I’m protective of its world, narrative, and characters. By some miracle, 28 Weeks Later was a compelling sequel with similarly intimate themes, exploring how human beings making even the simplest of decisions can send the world into chaos. Acting on our thoughts of passion, guilt, love, desire, and righteousness can doom society if we let them, leaving everyone else to pick up the pieces. I love the chaos, so the 28 Years Later trilogy pushing us so far forward into the future leaves me with plenty of questions, both good and bad. Both of the previous films are so unsettling because they aren’t afraid to explore how quickly society fell apart once the Rage Virus was unleashed. People can be infected with a single drop of blood, turning into zombies seconds later. One infected being in a large crowd spells doom for thousands, and by the time you’re aware of the danger, it’s too late. Whoever decided to intersperse Rudyard Kipling's 'Boots' into the soundscape of the trailer is a genius. It is a wartime poem which reinforces the themes of the film in some way. Even in this brief glimpse, it's undeniably haunting. It is pure terror, convincingly explaining to both the viewer and characters in this universe how it was impossible to come back from the brink. But then the zombies starved to death, like a human being would if they were acting on pure instinct with nothing to sustain them. The idea of this society-collapsing threat fading away thanks to the reality of human biology is fascinating, and something other zombie media has seldom tried to explore. Rather than the classic trope of having to do terrible things to stay alive, the humans waited things out until zombies collapsed of their own accord. The virus had spread to a point of irrelevance, allowing governments outside the UK to swoop in and reshape this empire in their own image. Despite its simplicity, there are multiple layers to these films and the ways they envision such a tried-and-true horror staple, which brings us to 28 Years Later and its debut trailer. A lot of comparisons are already being made to The Walking Dead and The Last of Us, to the point that some are afraid the trilogy is going to feel somewhat derivative. However, the setting also has plenty of Viking history that 28 Years Later could delve into, either blatantly or symbolically. Starring Aaron-Taylor Johnson, Jodie Comer, and Ralph Innes, the upcoming trilogy takes us back to the United Kingdom and to a solitary community on the isle of Lindsfarne, also known as Holy Island. It’s connected to the mainland by a giant causeway (though often covered by high tide), and for decades, a group of survivors has called it home. How exactly the universe has evolved remains unclear, but it seems that the outbreak persisted and society was placed into a continuous stream of very strict quarantines until, eventually, the world fell apart. Survivors are seen wielding bows and arrows, leading around mules and livestock, or adhering to traditional roles in society, each of which allows them to survive and work together in a world on the perpetual brink. A major turning point in the narrative eventually leads Aaron-Taylor Johnson’s character and a small child to venture to the mainland in search of something, leading them to cross paths with not only the infected, but other humans that have formed their own religious sects and Mad Max-esque gangs. It’s very post-apocalyptic and covered in obvious religious imagery and ideas, something I assume will become a mainstay throughout the trilogy. I have so many questions, and despite fearing that much of the imagery and overall concept of the trilogy feels derivative, I have faith in Danny Boyle and Alex Garland to put a distinct spin on things. Is this community even aware that the world has ended or the virus itself has died out, splitting themselves off from society to such an extent that they now risk dooming it all over again? Or has the idea of infected starving to death been entirely retconned? There is clearly something more that the trailer isn’t letting on, and how exactly this commune comes to function and reacts to the rage virus will play a big part in whether the film works or not. One scene has a child being lifted and celebrated in some sort of church setting, so perhaps children with fresh, uninfected blood are viewed as saviours of some sort. Later scenes in the trailer follow a military unit of some form cautiously moving through the dark before being attacked by either humans or infected, leading me to believe there has to be some sort of crossover between this isolated community and the modern world. Nothing is as it seems, and this trailer wants us to draw conclusions before going back on ourselves again and again. If the infected are now just zombies that live forever, I'd be bummed out, but there is enough imagery in this trailer - such as a zombie rising from the ground with little to no meat on its bones who might just be Cillian Murphy - that our expectations are going to be subverted.

Your comment has not been saved Jim being a \"living\" Rage virus carrier 28 YEARS after he was infected probably means they just don't starve there's no other way to explain how he made it from Weeks to here. The fact he's rising up the way he is, its clearly a dream sequence or something. Also the fact it's clearly Jim means that it's deliberately misleading in the trailer. That might not be 28 years later in that part of the film. It could be months after the original in that scene.

                "title": "Mark Gastineau - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Marcus Dell Gastineau (born November 20, 1956) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive end for the New York Jets of the National Football League (NFL) from 1979 to 1988. A five-time All-Pro and Pro Bowler, he was one of the quickest and most feared pass rushers of his generation, and the first player to lead the NFL in sacks in consecutive seasons. Gastineau was ranked no. 8 in National Football League (NFL) history on NFL Network's top 10 pass rushers. He entered Eastern Arizona Junior College in 1975 and earned All-America honors in his first season. He transferred to Arizona State University, and spent just one season playing defensive end there before finally settling upon East Central Oklahoma State University, now East Central University, in Ada, Oklahoma. He had 27 quarterback sacks in his college career,[1] and earned Outstanding Defensive Lineman honors for the North in the 1979 Senior Bowl. Gastineau became ECU's first-ever draft pick when the New York Jets selected him in the second round of the 1979 NFL draft.[2] Connie Carberg, the first female NFL scout in history, was credited with helping the Jets discover Gastineau. The team was coaching in the Senior Bowl and needed another defensive lineman on the roster due to a vacancy, so Carberg called several prospects before suggesting Gastineau to be the replacement based on a phone conversation with him. He was projected to be an eighth round draft pick at the time, but due to his performance in the Senior Bowl and other pre-draft processes, the Jets selected him in the second round.[3] Gastineau was among the most talented and honored defensive linemen of his era. He made the Pro Bowl five straight seasons (1981–1985) and finished his ten-year career with 74 officially recorded sacks (sacks were not an official stat for the first three years of his career). He was a First-team All-Pro in 1982–1984 and was consensus All-AFC in each of those years. In New York, Gastineau was a key part of the famed \"New York Sack Exchange,\" the Jets defensive line that also included Joe Klecko, Marty Lyons and Abdul Salaam. The four combined for 66 sacks in 1981, including twenty by Gastineau (In 1981 sacks were unofficial, but Gastineau's 20 sacks trailed Klecko by only half a sack), to lead the Jets to their first playoff game since 1969. He was Second-team All-Pro in 1981 as well as being consensus All-AFC. In November 1981, he, Klecko, Lyons and Salaam were invited to ring the ceremonial opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, which served as the inspiration for their nickname.[4] With Klecko rupturing the patella tendon in his right knee in the second game of the strike shortened 1982 season against the New England Patriots, Gastineau became the new unofficial leader of the \"Sack Exchange.\" Though he was often double teamed, he finished the season with six sacks, and was voted the NFL Defensive Player of the Year by NEA (and awarded the George Halas Trophy). The Jets made the playoffs again in 1982, losing the AFC Championship game to the Miami Dolphins.[5] The 1983 season started with Gastineau and the Jets' first round pick of the 1983 NFL draft, quarterback Ken O'Brien, being arrested and charged with assault at Studio 54.[6] Despite this off-the-field indiscretion, Gastineau totaled 19 sacks to lead the NFL for the first time. Gastineau was nationally famous for doing his signature \"Sack Dance\" after sacking an opposing quarterback. However, he had to stop when the NFL declared it \"unsportsmanlike taunting\" in March 1984 and began fining players for it. The ban on the dance stemmed from a bench-clearing brawl in the third quarter of a 27–24 overtime win over the Los Angeles Rams at Shea Stadium on September 25, 1983, which began with a sack of Vince Ferragamo by Gastineau who was then shoved from behind by Jackie Slater, the right tackle he had beaten on the play. One month later on October 21, a total of $15,750 in fines was assessed by the NFL against 16 Jets ($7,300) and 21 Rams ($8,450), with Gastineau incurring a $1,000 penalty.[7][8] Gastineau had his best individual season with an NFL record 22 sacks (leading the NFL for the second year in a row), 69 tackles and one fumble recovery for a touchdown in 1984. He was voted the UPI AFC Defensive Player of the Year, and was also named MVP of that season's Pro Bowl after tallying four sacks and a safety in that game. Gastineau's sack record stood for 17 years until Michael Strahan broke it in 2001. New defensive coordinator Bud Carson installed a 3-4 defense for the 1985 season. Gastineau shifted from left defensive end to right defensive end, although he did move him around to allow for mismatches. Gastineau broke his hand early in that season but still finished second in the league with 13½ sacks and was voted All-Pro by the NEA. The Jets finished 11–5 in 1985 to earn a wildcard spot in the playoffs along with fellow AFC East rivals, the New England Patriots. Gastineau recorded a sack in the Jets' 26–14 loss to the Pats at the Meadowlands.[9] For the start of the 1986 season, Gastineau was featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated alongside New York Giants star linebacker Lawrence Taylor. Injuries limited Gastineau to just two sacks in ten games (his lowest total since his rookie season) as he was slowed by groin and abdominal muscle ailments and then by a damaged left knee that required arthroscopic surgery and forced him to miss the last five games of the regular season. Gastineau rebounded in the postseason, however, recording a sack in the Jets 35–15 wildcard round victory over the Kansas City Chiefs[10] and 2+1⁄2 more in the divisional-round playoff game against the Cleveland Browns. Late in the fourth quarter of that game, though, with the Jets leading 20–10 and the Browns facing a second down and 24 from their own 18-yard line, Gastineau was called for a roughing the passer penalty. The play had originally resulted in an incomplete pass by Browns quarterback Bernie Kosar so instead of having a 3rd-and-24 situation, the 15-yard penalty on Gastineau gave the Browns a first down at their own 33. From there, the Browns drove the remaining 67 yards to a touchdown which cut the Jets' lead to 20–17. The Browns would later tie the game with 7 seconds remaining in regulation on a 22-yard field goal by Mark Moseley and win it on a 27-yard field goal by Moseley 2 minutes and 2 seconds into the second overtime period. After the game, Gastineau said that he hadn't been guilty of roughing and that he was \"just following through.\" Teammate Marty Lyons, the Jets' other starting defensive end, defended Gastineau saying, \"(Ben Dreith) is a referee who's known to take care of the quarterback.\" Joe Walton, the Jets' head coach would say only, \"It was a very key play, Mark was just trying to do the best he could do.\"[11] In 1987, Gastineau was the only Jet regular to immediately cross the picket line in that year's players' strike, citing his need to pay alimony. Teammate Dave Jennings said of this understandably unpopular move: \"We expected it from Mark. He's always put himself in front of the team.\" The crossing brought to a head longstanding tensions between Gastineau and his teammates; he had never been popular in the locker room.[12] Gastineau got into a fight with backup center Guy Bingham when he drove into the Jets complex early in the strike. Gastineau was later joined in crossing the picket line by teammates Marty Lyons and Joe Klecko, further undermining the players' strike. Gastineau led the AFC in sacks seven weeks into the 1988 season.[13] He then abruptly announced his retirement soon after Brigitte Nielsen, to whom he had previously announced his engagement, claimed to be suffering from cancer of the uterus.[14][13] The announcement was followed by a surge of investigation by local New York papers of whether she was telling the truth, reflecting citywide mistrust of Gastineau.[15] At the time of his retirement, Gastineau was the NFL's all-time leader in sacks. Gastineau attempted a comeback with the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League in 1990, but was released after only four games.[16] Gastineau was inducted into the New York Jets Ring of Honor on October 8, 2012.[17] In 2022, the Professional Football Researchers Association named Gastineau to the PFRA Hall of Very Good Class of 2022.[18] In 1991, Gastineau began a career in boxing, lasting five years. In his first fight, Gastineau knocked out Derrick Dukes in the first round. Dukes, a professional wrestler, later admitted he took a dive. TV newsmagazine show 60 Minutes interviewed several others that fought Gastineau and were told to take dives to make Gastineau look good. His career ended in 1996 when he lost to another former football player, Alonzo Highsmith. In 18 career bouts, his record in boxing was 15 wins, two losses, and one no-contest. Gastineau has been married three times. His first wife, Lisa Gastineau and their daughter Brittny Gastineau starred in the E! reality television show, The Gastineau Girls. Gastineau has a son with actress Brigitte Nielsen, Killian Marcus.[19] He was estranged from both children in 2010.[20] Shortly after his release from prison in 2001, Gastineau claimed he had put his turbulent past behind him after he had a religious conversion to faith in Jesus Christ. Gastineau has appeared on programs such as The 700 Club to speak of his experience.[21] Gastineau is a member of the choir at Times Square Church, where he married third wife JoAnn in 2007.[17] In 1984, Gastineau was found guilty of assaulting a patron at Studio 54. He was sentenced to 90 hours of community service, teaching football to inmates at Rikers Island.[22] In 1991, Gastineau was arrested for picking up a package of amphetamine pills at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport. He was sentenced to three years probation in 1993.[23][24] In September 2000, Gastineau was sentenced to 18 months in jail after failing to complete an anger management course after hitting his second wife Patricia.[24] In 2016, Gastineau was diagnosed with dementia, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease.[25] Gastineau said he believed the illnesses could be traced back to football, stating he wanted to continue to teach younger football players how to play the game safely.[26] He blames the brain diseases on poor tackling technique.[27] In March 2019, Gastineau revealed that he had been battling colon cancer.[28]",

(2:28) Former New York Jets star Mark Gastineau, who has carried a grudge against Brett Favre for two decades, confronted the Hall of Fame quarterback last year at a memorabilia show and accused him of deliberately taking a sack that cost Gastineau the NFL's single-season record. It made for a tense and uncomfortable scene, captured on video. It appears in the ESPN 30 for 30 documentary \"The New York Sack Exchange,\" which premieres 8 p.m. ET Friday (ESPN/ESPN+). An angry Gastineau attended the memorabilia show in Chicago with two other members of the Jets' \"Sack Exchange,\" a four-man defensive line that dominated the early 1980s. He approached an unsuspecting Favre at a table where the Green Bay Packers legend was signing autographs. They shook hands. Favre mentioned how they had met once before. \"Yeah, right -- when you fell down for him,\" said Gastineau, alluding to former New York Giants star Michael Strahan -- the record breaker. \"I'm going to get my sack back. I'm going to get my sack back, dude.\" Favre looked bewildered. \"You probably would hurt me,\" he said. \"Well, I don't care,\" Gastineau said, pointing at Favre. \"You hurt me. You hurt me! You hear me?\" \"Yeah, I hear you,\" Favre said. \"You really hurt me,\" Gastineau shot back. \"You really hurt me, Brett.\" At that point, Favre was escorted away by one of his handlers, leaving a seething Gastineau by himself. He was miked up by a camera crew, which was following him. Gastineau was referring to the final game of the 2001 season, when Strahan broke Gastineau's single-season record with a controversial sack of Favre. With 22 sacks, Gastineau held the mark from 1984 to 2001. Many believe Favre went down on purpose so Strahan could break the record with 22.5. Gastineau was in attendance that day, graciously congratulating Strahan. After 18 years of suppressing his anger, Gastineau went public with his true feelings in a 2020 interview with ESPN. He doubles down in the documentary. \"Anybody will tell you that Brett Favre took a dive,\" Gastineau said in the documentary. The 30 for 30 chronicles the rise and fall of the \"Sack Exchange\" and the complex relationship between the polarizing Gastineau and teammates Joe Klecko, Marty Lyons and the late Abdul Salaam. Reached by phone, Gastineau explained why he confronted Favre. \"I wanted to let him know it was a trash sack,\" he said. \"I've been wanting to do that for a long time -- many, many years,\" Gastineau added. \"I've only got one more guy to go to\" -- meaning Strahan, who Gastineau says he believes conspired with Favre on the record-breaking sack. Gastineau had no idea Favre would be at the show until he and his wife, Jo Ann, arrived in Chicago and saw Favre's name on a list of attendees. Lyons, who was in Chicago and witnessed the confrontation, said he tried to convince his former teammate to stay away from Favre. \"I said, 'Mark, let it go, just let it go. That happened years ago,'\" Lyons said in a phone interview. \"But he had this little crazed look in his eye.\" Later that day, Jo Ann Gastineau returned to Favre's table to smooth things over. She said she apologized, saying her husband \"didn't mean anything by it.\" The record has been a source of anguish for Strahan as well. \"The sack record is great, absolutely phenomenal, but I almost feel like in a sense it was diminished because everyone goes, 'Oh, Brett Favre gave you a sack,'\" Strahan said in \"A Football Life,\" a documentary aired in 2013 by NFL Network. \"I caught so much flak over it. ... It's not worth it, because everyone looks as if one sack that they question is the defining moment of my career.\" The Hall of Famer is no longer the sole holder of the single-season record, as Pittsburgh Steelers star T.J. Watt matched Strahan's mark with 22.5 sacks in 2021. On Tuesday, Favre posted a long thread on X, addressing what he described as \"a small dustup\" between him and Gastineau. Favre said he didn't intentionally take the sack to hurt Gastineau, saying, \"There was no malice on my part.\" In retrospect, Favre said he sees how the sack record might have benefitted Gastineau financially and strengthened his case for the Hall of Fame. \"A while back, he saw me at a card show and got his frustration off his chest,\" Favre posted. \"It's not the kind of moment that should be filmed and released. It was a private moment of frustration between two old football warriors.\" Favre endorsed Gastineau for the Hall of Fame. \"I hope this controversy brings attention to just how great Mark Gastineau was. He belongs in Canton.\"",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Mark Gastineau forced a smile as he congratulated Michael Strahan for breaking his single-season sack record on the final day of the 2001 season. Gastineau, though, was incensed at how Strahan broke his record, and he let Brett Favre -- the quarterback Strahan tackled for the record-breaking sack -- know about it more than two decades later. Strahan got the record after Favre (who was seen talking to Strahan moments earlier) slid right in front of him near the end of the game. As you'll see in the video below, Gastineau confronted Favre at a memorabilia show last year. Favre was friendly at the beginning at the conversation, but Gastineau quickly made it clear that he had a two-decade-old ax to grind. \"I'm gonna get my sack back,\" Gastineau told Favre. \"I'm gonna get my sack back, dude. ... You hurt me. You hurt me. You hear me? You really hurt me. You hurt me, Brett.\" 22 years after losing the NFL single-season sack record, Mark Gastineau confronted Brett Favre for ‘taking a dive’ on the record-breaking play.Catch the latest @30for30, 'The New York Sack Exchange,' on ESPN and ESPN+ starting Dec. 13. pic.twitter.com/Oz5KRwVcy7 Gastineau, whose 22.0 sacks in 1984 stood as the record for 17 years, feels that the NFL should have stepped in and disallowed Strahan's record-breaking sack to count. \"The NFL should have stopped that,\" he said. \"(Favre) took that record away from me.\" Favre later responded to the video on social media. He said that the sack was the result of him deciding to run a bootleg and \"squeeze the last bit of fun out of a hard-fought game.\" But instead of seeing an open field, Favre saw Strahan and immediately went down. \"In a different game or situation, I would have made a bigger effort to avoid the sack or TFL,\" Favre wrote on X. \"But at no point was I thinking about hurting Gastineau. Maybe it crossed my mind to help Strahan. I didn't think it through. That wasn't my forte at the time. I just wanted to have fun and compete. In retrospect, I understand how Gastineau feels. We played a brutal game. Gastineau played during an era where guys didn't make generational wealth. \"I see now how being the Sack King would elevate his value at card shows, strengthen his case for the Hall of Fame, increase his demand as a public speaker. I had no way of knowing that then. I realize now the potential financial implications because football is far more business-oriented than when me or Mark played.\" Favre hopes that this situation helps shed light on Gastineau's impressive career that included three All-Pro nods, five Pro Bowl selections and a Defensive Player of the Year award. Gastineau is also the Jets' all-time career sack leader. \"I have a great deal of respect for Mark,\" Favre wrote. \"I hope one day he joins me in the Hall of Fame. He earned it.\" Gastineau's record was eventually matched by Jared Allen in 2011 and surpassed in 2021 by T.J. Watt, who tied Strahan's record of 22.5 sacks. Ironically, the player who unofficially has the record is Al Baker, who registered 23 sacks in 1978 as a member of the Detroit Lions. Unfortunately for Baker, the NFL did not begin to make individual sacks an official statistic until 1982. (Baker's total was compiled by Pro Football Reference in 2021.) The footage of Gastineau's encounter with Favre is part of ESPN's upcoming documentary on the Jets' iconic \"New York Sack Exchange\" defensive line, a unit that included Gastineau, 2023 Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee Joe Klecko, Marty Lyons and Abdul Salaam. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

                "content": "Max Dorian Fried (/ˈfriːd/ FREED; born January 18, 1994) is an American professional baseball pitcher who is a free agent.[1] He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Atlanta Braves. Drafted in 2012 by the San Diego Padres in the first round, seventh overall, Fried made his major league debut in 2017. His 17 wins in 2019 were 2nd-most in the National League, and his seven wins in 2020 were again 2nd-most in the NL. Fried pitched 6 shut-out innings in the final game of the 2021 World Series against the Houston Astros, helping lead the Braves to their first World Series title in 26 years.[2] Through 2023, Fried had the best career win–loss percentage of all Braves pitchers, at .705. In 2020, Fried won the NL Gold Glove Award at pitcher and the Fielding Bible Award at pitcher. In 2021, he won the Gold Glove Award again, as well as the Silver Slugger Award for pitchers, becoming the third pitcher in MLB history to win both awards in the same year. He was also named to the All-MLB Team those two years. In 2022, he was named an All Star and won his third consecutive Gold Glove Award at pitcher. In 2024, he was again an All Star. Fried was born and grew up in Encino, California, the middle son of Carrie and Jonathan Fried, and is Jewish.[3][4][5] His younger brother Jake, also a pitcher, attended the University of Arizona.[6] Max began attending the Reggie Smith Baseball Academy in Encino, California, at the age of seven, and learned how to throw a curveball from the retired outfielder.[7] Fried pitched for the 2009 Maccabiah Games Team USA Juniors baseball team that won a gold medal in Israel.[8] Fried first attended Montclair College Preparatory School, in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, where he played baseball, football, and basketball.[9] As a sophomore, with Ethan Katz as his pitching coach, he was 10–3 with a 1.81 earned run average (ERA), and was named the Olympic League MVP and to the All-California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) Division V first team.[10][11][12] In his junior year Fried was 7–3 with a 1.31 ERA, with 100 strikeouts in 69 innings, as he also played outfield and batted .360 with four home runs and 30 RBIs.[13][14] He was named the 2011 Southern California Jewish Sports Hall of Fame Male High School Athlete of the Year.[11] After Montclair Prep cut its baseball team subsequent to his junior year, Fried then transferred to Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles, where he wore uniform number 32 in honor of Sandy Koufax and played with fellow future MLB pitchers Lucas Giolito and Jack Flaherty.[8] In 2012, his senior year, Fried was 8–2 with a 2.02 ERA, and 105 strikeouts in 66 innings.[15][16] He was a 2012 Rawlings-Perfect Game 1st Team All-American.[17] The San Diego Padres selected Fried in the first round with the seventh overall selection of the 2012 Major League Baseball draft.[18] Fried chose to sign with the Padres for $3 million despite his commitment to the UCLA Bruins baseball team.[3][19] Baseball America rated him the top left-hander available in the draft.[20] Fried made his professional debut for the Arizona League Padres in 2012 and spent the whole season there, going 0–1 with a 3.57 ERA in 17.2 innings pitched. He played for the Fort Wayne TinCaps in 2013 where he compiled a 6–7 record and 3.49 ERA in 23 starts. At the end of the year, Fried was ranked the 43rd-best prospect in the minors by MLBPipeline.[21] He was also named an MiLB.com Padres Organization All Star, and Baseball America ranked his curveball as the best in the Padres' minor league system.[22][23] In 2014, he was ranked the Padres' top pitching prospect, and their No. 2 prospect overall, by MLB.com.[22] Fried was injured for much of the year and did not make his season debut until July. The next month, on August 20, Fried underwent Tommy John surgery; he missed the remainder of the 2014 season.[21] On December 19, 2014, the Padres traded Fried, Jace Peterson, Dustin Peterson, and Mallex Smith to the Atlanta Braves in exchange for Justin Upton and Aaron Northcraft.[24] Fried missed the entire 2015 season while recovering from Tommy John surgery.[21] He returned to action on April 9, 2016, for the Rome Braves.[25] Fried spent all of 2016 with Rome, pitching to an 8–7 record and 3.93 ERA in 21 games (20 starts), striking out 112 batters in 103.0 innings. Fried ended the season ranked by Baseball America as the 6th-best prospect in the South Atlantic League.[26] His fastball, clocked at 93–94 mph, reached 96–97 mph in the second half of the season.[27] The Braves added Fried to their 40-man roster after the season.[28] Fried was invited to spring training for the first time at the start of the 2017 season.[29] He began the season at the Class AA level with the Mississippi Braves.[30][31] He was ranked as the Braves' No. 8 prospect overall by MLB.com in May, and the #89 prospect in minor league baseball in July.[32][33] Fried was named Southern League Pitcher of the Week for the week ending April 30.[34] Fried was called up to the Atlanta Braves on August 5, 2017.[35] He debuted on August 8, throwing two scoreless innings against the Philadelphia Phillies, displaying what David O'Brien of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution called \"a devastating curveball\".[36][37] Two weeks later, Fried returned to the minor leagues, joining the AAA Gwinnett Braves.[38] In 26 innings pitched for the Braves for the season, he was 1–1 with a 3.81 ERA.[39] At the end of the 2017 season, Fried joined the Peoria Javelinas of the Arizona Fall League, for whom he was named league Player of the Week on October 31.[40][41] He led the league with 32 strikeouts in 26 innings (3rd in the league), and was 3–1 with a 1.73 ERA (6th) in six starts.[42][43] He ranked first among starters with a .163 opponents' batting average, was second in fewest-baserunners-allowed-per-nine-innings (7.96), and was named to the AFL's Top Prospects Team.[42] Baseball America rated him # 3 on the AFL Hot Sheet.[44] In December, Braves manager Brian Snitker said that he might look at Fried, Lucas Sims, or another pitcher as the team's fifth starter in 2018.[45] Fried began the 2018 season with the AA Mississippi Braves. After one game, he joined the Gwinnett Stripers.[46] He was called up to Atlanta in April.[47] In 33.2 innings pitched for the Braves in the 2018 regular season, he was 1–4 with 44 strikeouts and a 2.94 ERA.[39] With runners in scoring position he kept batters to one hit in 30 at bats (.033); and with RISP and two outs, opposing batters were 0-for-14 with eight strikeouts.[1] Fried was placed in the bullpen at the start of the 2019 season, and later moved to the starting rotation.[48][49][50] In a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers on May 7, Fried was hit on his left hand by a ball hit by Alex Verdugo and left the game, but he made his next regularly scheduled start.[51][52][53] In 2019 Fried was 17–6 with a 4.02 ERA, as in 33 games (30 starts) he pitched 165.2 innings in which he struck out 173 batters.[39] His 17 wins were 2nd in the National League, and his .739 won-loss percentage was 5th in the league.[39] He induced the second-lowest percentage of fly balls (22.2%), and the third-highest percentage of ground balls (53.6%), of all NL pitchers, and threw his curveball 24.6% of the time (6th in the league).[54] His 9.398 strikeouts/9 IP were the 5th-highest in a single season of any Braves pitcher in history.[55] On defense, he led all NL pitchers in assists with 34, and had the 2nd-best range factor/9 innings pitched of 2.23.[39] He had a 6 Defensive Runs Saved (DRS) rating, the best in the major leagues among pitchers.[56] Fried also batted .196 (9th among NL pitchers)/.262 (6th)/.268 (10th), and led all NL pitchers with at least 50 plate appearances in runs (11) and BB/SO ratio (0.31), while having the 2nd-lowest swinging strike percentage (7.1%), 3rd in contact percentage (81.6%), and tying for 3rd in walks (5).[57] During the season Fried developed into the ace starting pitcher for the Braves.[58][59] In the pandemic-shortened 2020 regular season, Fried had a 7–0 win-loss record with a 2.25 ERA and a 1.09 WHIP.[60] He led the major leagues in won-loss percentage (1.000) and pickoffs (4), led the National League in WAR for pitchers (2.9), was 2nd in the NL in Wins Above Replacement-all behind Mookie Betts, and tied for 2nd in the NL in wins.[61][62] He held batters to an average exit velocity on batted balls of 83.4 mph, and hard-hit balls to 23.8%, both among the lowest 2% of all major league pitchers.[63] His four pickoffs through September 6 were the most in the majors in 2020, and he needed only 12 pickoff attempts to do so.[64] Since his major league debut in 2017, Fried's 14 pickoffs were the most in the majors, and he was successful on 19% of his attempts.[64] In that same time-span, pitchers in all of baseball had been successful in picking off runners in only 0.017% of attempts.[64] Fried started the season by becoming the first left-handed pitcher to not allow any home runs through eight starts, with his team winning every game, since Babe Ruth in 1917.[65] On defense, Fried led all major league pitchers in assists for the second consecutive season (with 15), tied for the MLB lead in pickoffs (with 4; with his 9 in 2019–20 he was tops in major league baseball), and led all pitchers with five Defensive Runs Saved.[66][67][68][69] Fried won the 2020 NL Gold Glove Award at pitcher.[70] He became the fourth Braves pitcher to win the award, joining Mike Hampton, Greg Maddux, and Phil Niekro, and the first Braves player to win the award for a pitcher in 17 years.[66][71] He also won the 2020 Fielding Bible Award at pitcher.[72] The award honors the top fielder in the Major Leagues at pitcher.[72] He came in fifth in voting for the 2020 NL Cy Young Award.[73] He was named a starter on the 2020 All-MLB First Team.[74] Fried was the Braves' 2021 Opening Day starting pitcher.[75][76] His first career complete game shutout was a Maddux, pitched against the Baltimore Orioles on August 20, 2021.[77][78] Fried threw a second Maddux on September 24, while facing the San Diego Padres.[79][80] His 1.76 ERA and 0.84 WHIP in the second half of the season were the best in the major leagues.[81] He was named the National League Pitcher of the Month for September, after posting a 1.54 ERA.[82][83] In the 2021 regular season, Fried was 14–7 with a 3.04 ERA (9th in the National League), and his 14 wins were 5th in the NL.[39] In 28 starts he threw 2 shutouts (leading the league), as in 165.2 innings he averaged 7.5 hits, 0.8 home runs (3rd), and 2.2 walks per 9 innings, for a 1.087 WHIP.[39] His 8.584 strikeouts/9 innings were the 11th-most in Braves history.[55] His 51.8% ground ball percentage was 3rd-highest in the NL, and he induced softly hit balls 20.0% of the time (5th).[84] As a batter, he hit .273/.322/.327. His batting average and on-base percentage led all pitchers, while his slugging percentage ranked second. He scored 7 runs (2nd), hit three doubles (2nd), and drove in 5 RBIs (6th) in 55 at bats, had the second-highest exit velocity of all pitchers (90.3 mph), had 8 sacrifice hits (8th of all players), and was called upon to pinch hit four times.[39][85] On July 4, 2021, he had a pinch-hit, walk-off, single against the Miami Marlins.[86] On defense, Fried led the league in range factor/game as a pitcher (1.61), in assists as a pitcher for the third consecutive season (37), and in Defensive Runs Saved for the third season in a row (6). For the second consecutive season he tied for the major league lead in pickoffs (6).[39] In the three years in which Fried was a starter, from 2019 to 2021, he led all National League pitchers in wins (38), was tied for the lead in shutouts (2), was 2nd in the vertical movement of his curveball (−11.6 inches; batters hit .183/.218/.294 against it), and had the third-lowest barrels percentage in balls hit against him (5.0%).[87] In those three years on offense he led NL pitchers in runs (18), doubles (7), on base percentage (.292), and WAR (1.3), was 2nd-lowest in strikeout percentage (25.8%), and third in batting average (.234), slugging percentage (.297), OPS (.589), and walks (9).[88] In those three years on defense he led all NL pitchers in assists (86).[89] Fried won the final game of the 2021 World Series with six shutout innings against the Astros, who had led the majors in batting average and runs for the season, with Houston's three-time batting champion Jose Altuve observing: \"He was almost unhittable.\"[90] Fried won the 2021 NL Gold Glove Award at pitcher, winning the award for the second year in a row.[91][92] He became the third Braves pitcher to win multiple Gold Glove Awards, joining Greg Maddux and Phil Niekro.[93] Major League managers and coaches (voting only within their league, and unable to vote for players on their own team), account for 75% of the selection process, while the other 25% is a sabermetric component.[94] Fried also won the 2021 NL Silver Slugger Award for pitchers.[95] The award was given to the top offensive player at pitcher in the NL, as determined by a vote by the manager and three coaches of each MLB team (and no manager/coach can vote for a player on his own team).[96][97] Fried became the third MLB pitcher in history to win both the Silver Slugger Award and the Gold Glove Award in the same season, joining Mike Hampton (2003) and Zack Greinke (2019).[98] Fried was the final recipient of the Silver Slugger Award for pitchers, as the National League permanently implemented the designated hitter in 2022. He was named a starter on the 2021 All-MLB Second Team, earning his second consecutive All-MLB selection.[99] Through 2021, of the Braves career leaders, Fried was second in win–loss percentage (.690; behind Russ Ortiz and ahead of Greg Maddux).[100] Fried was named to his second straight Opening Day start in 2022.[101][102][103] Fried's salary for the 2022 season was set at $6.85 million via arbitration.[104] He was named to the 2022 Major League Baseball All-Star Game roster at midseason.[105][106] For the season, Fried was 14–7 with a 2.48 ERA (3rd in the NL; 10th-lowest in Atlanta franchise history), in 30 starts in which he pitched 185.1 innings with 170 strikeouts.[107][108] He gave up the lowest percentage of hard-hit balls in the NL (24.5%) and had the lowest barrel-percentage against (4.0%), was 2nd in fewest walks/9 innings (1.55), 3rd in strikeouts/walk (5.31) and fewest home runs/9 innings (0.58), 4th in ground ball percentage (51.2%), and tied for 5th in highest LOB (78.2%).[109] His curveball had the highest vertical movement of those of all NL pitchers, the exit velocity of balls hit against him (86.2 mph) was the third-lowest in the NL, and batters swung at his pitches outside the strike zone 36.8% of the time, the fourth-highest rate in the NL.[110] In the four seasons from 2019 to 2022, he had the lowest barrel-percentage against (4.6%) of all major league pitchers, and his 52 wins were second in the major leagues only to the 56 wins of pitcher Gerrit Cole.[111] On defense, opponents became hesitant to run on him.[112] Since his major league debut in 2017, his 23 pickoffs lead major league baseball, with him having picked the runner off in 14.29% of his career pickoff attempts, a much higher percentage than the major league average of 1.6%.[113] Fried was named the 2022 NL Gold Glove Award winner at pitcher, his third straight Gold Glove Award.[112] He became the first Braves pitcher since Greg Maddux to win three straight Gold Glove Awards.[114] The only other pitchers who have won the award three times in a row have been Harvey Haddix, Bobby Shantz, Bob Gibson, Phil Niekro, and Zack Greinke.[115] Fried finished second in the voting for the 2022 NL Cy Young Award.[116] It was the second time in three years he finished in the top five in Cy Young Award voting, as he had finished fifth in 2020.[117] At the end of the 2022 season, Fried was selected to his third consecutive All-MLB team.[118] Fried's 2023 season salary of $13.5 million was again determined by the arbitration process.[119] As the Opening Day starter for the third straight year, Fried was removed in the fourth inning against the Washington Nationals.[120][121] He spent time on the 15-day injured list in early April and early May, first for a strained left hamstring, then a strained left forearm.[122][123][124] On June 5, Fried was transferred to the 60-day injured list.[125] He was activated on August 4.[126] In the 2023 regular season Fried was 8–1 with a 2.55 ERA (the second-lowest in the major leagues among pitchers with at least 14 starts), as in 14 starts he had one shutout, and struck out 80 batters while giving up 18 walks in 77.2 innings.[39] Batters hit .109 against his curveball.[63][1] Of NL pitchers who pitched 70 or more innings in 2023, he was 2nd in ground ball percentage (57.7%) and lowest hard-hit percentage (24.2%), 3rd in lowest barrel percentage (3.8%), 5th in ERA, 6th in left-on-base percentage (82.3%) and lowest average exit velocity (86.5 mph), 7th in lowest line drive percentage (16.8%), and 9th in home runs/9 innings (0.81).[127] He ended the season as the Braves' career leader in won-loss percentage (.705), second in strikeouts/9 innings pitched (8.835), fourth in strikeouts/walk (3.688), eighth in WHIP (1.163), and 10th in hits per nine innings pitched (8.075).[100] From the beginning of his first full season in 2019 to the end of the 2023 regular season, Fried recorded 60 wins, the most in the NL and second to Gerrit Cole's 71 victories during this time period.[128][100] His 25 pickoffs since debuting in 2017 were the most in major league baseball, and in his career he had picked off a runner in 14.5% of his pickoff attempts, much higher than the MLB average during that period of 1.7%.[1] Fried and the Braves agreed to a one-year $15 million contract for the 2024 season, his final season before free agency.[129][130] Fried's streak of Opening Day starts was ended by Spencer Strider.[131][132] In Fried's season debut, the second game of the year against the Philadelphia Phillies, he recorded only two outs.[133][134] On April 23, Fried pitched a complete game shutout against the Miami Marlins, facing 29 hitters and throwing 92 pitches for his third career Maddux.[135] He pitched a scoreless inning for the NL team in the All Star Game, the second of his career.[39] In 2024, Fried was 11–10 with one shutout in 29 starts covering 174.1 innings, in which he gave up 146 hits and 57 walks while striking out 166 batters, and led the NL in ground ball percentage (58.8%) while having the second-lowest exit velocity (86.3 mph) and percentage of \"hard speed\" contact induced (26.1%).[39][136] He had a 3.25 ERA (5th in the NL), with 7.5 hits per 9 innings (7th), 0.64 home runs per 9 innings (4th), and a 1.164 WHIP (8th), keeping opposing batters to a .225 batting average (7th), while on defense he tied for the league lead with a 1.000 fielding percentage.[39][136] Fried received a qualifying offer from the Braves at the end of the season,[137][138] which he declined.[139] Fried throws a 94–96 mph four-seam fastball.[63] He also throws two types of a 74 mph \"plus\" curveball (which he patterned after that of Sandy Koufax), an 85 mph slider (since 2019), a 93 mph sinker, and an 86 mph change-up,[63][140][141] with the curveball resulting in the lowest batting average in 2021 (.160).[63]",

                "title": "Max Fried to sign with Yankees: New York picks up ace lefty on eight-year, $218 million deal - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The New York Yankees have landed one of the top starting pitchers in baseball. Left-hander Max Fried and the ballclub have agreed to a eight-year contract worth $218 million, CBS Sports HQ has confirmed. The deal includes a full no-trade clause and does not have opt-outs or deferrals, according to the New York Post. The team has not yet announced the signing. The Yankees missed out on free-agent right fielder Juan Soto two days ago when he accepted a 15-year, $765 million deal from the Mets. As part of the pivot here to Plan B, Fried ends up in the Bronx. The deal makes him the best-paid left-handed pitcher in MLB history. Fried is the third core member of the Atlanta Braves' 2021 World Series championship team to leave as a free agent, joining Freddie Freeman and Dansby Swanson. Fried started and won the Game 6 title clincher against the Houston Astros, striking out six in six shutout innings in the decisive Game 6 at Minute Maid Park. Our R.J. Anderson ranked Fried the fifth-best free agent available this offseason, and the third best pitcher behind Corbin Burnes and Blake Snell. Here's his write-up: We wanted to print a complete list of left-handed starting pitchers with a better ERA+ than Fried since the beginning of the 2020 season, but we ran into a problem when we went to compile the names. You see, no sinister hurler who had a decent amount of innings (min. 200 combined) actually placed ahead of him in that metric. Oh well. Blame Fried's sustained excellence on his ability to manage contact. He ranked in the 95th percentile in average exit velocity last season, and he did it while generating nearly 60% ground balls for a second consecutive year. The biggest knock on Fried is his innings count, as he's cleared the 180-threshold just once in his career. Given the league's direction over the past decade, we're not inclined to think that'll hurt him. Fried, 31 in January, pitched to a 3.25 ERA in 29 starts and 174 ⅓ innings in 2024, and it was his worst season since 2019, his first full year as a big-leaguer. From 2020-23, Fried had a 2.66 ERA in close to 500 innings with the excellent underlying numbers to match. Simply put, he has been one of the game's best pitchers over the last half-decade. The Braves originally acquired Fried as a prospect in the Justin Upton trade with the San Diego Padres in December 2014. Because he declined the qualifying offer, Atlanta will receive a compensation draft pick after the fourth round for losing Fried. There remains plenty of offseason, but with Fried on board, the Yankees' rotation right now looks something like: Righty Marcus Stroman and lefty Nestor Cortes are also still on the roster and could provide depth here or serve as trade bait. The Yankees won the AL East and won the AL pennant last season despite Cole starting the year on the injured list. They got 32 starts from Rodón, 30 from Cortes, 29 from Stroman, 29 from Gil, 17 from Cole and 16 from Schmidt. If they can get full seasons from Cole, Fried and Schmidt, that rotation looks a lot better and it was already a good one in 2024. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "content": "Estimated read time: 3-4 minutes DALLAS — The New York Yankees hope Max Fried pitches like he did in 2021 — when he won the World Series clincher for the Atlanta Braves. Two days after the Yankees lost Juan Soto to the rival Mets, Fried agreed Tuesday to join the pinstripes with a $218 million, eight-year contract, a person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press. Fried's deal is the largest for a left-handed pitcher in baseball history, $1 million more than David Price's seven-year contract with the Boston Red Sox ahead of the 2016 season. Fried's agreement, first reported by ESPN, was subject to a successful physical, the person said on condition of anonymity because the deal had not been finalized. Yankees fans were angry after Soto accepted the Mets' $765 million, 15-year offer over the Yankees' $760 million, 16-year proposal. The Yankees then redirected money to starting pitching, though Fried represents some risk: The two-time All-Star has been on the injured list 10 times since 2018, including at least once each season. A high school teammate of Jack Flaherty and Lucas Giolito at Harvard-Westlake in Los Angeles, Fried gets the fourth-highest contract among pitchers behind the Los Angeles Dodgers' Yoshinobu Yamamoto ($325 million for 12 years through 2035), the Yankees' Gerrit Cole ($324 million for nine years through 2028) and Washington's Stephen Strasburg ($245 million for seven years through 2026). Strasburg hasn't pitched since 2022 and has retired. After spending his first eight seasons with the Braves, Fried joins a list of rotation possibilities that also includes Cole, Carlos Rodón, Luis Gil, Clarke Schmidt, Nestor Cortes and Marcus Stroman, making additional moves likely. He reached the agreement on the day Cortes turned 30 and Rodón turned 32. A three-time Gold Glove winner who turns 31 on Jan. 18, Fried has one of the broadest repertoires in the major leagues, throwing seven different pitches. He averaged 93.9 mph this year with his fastball, which he threw 33.6% of the time. Fried mixed in 21% curveballs, 15.6% sinkers, 13.6% changeups, 5.9% sweepers, 5.6% sliders and 4.7% cutters. He was 11-10 with a 3.25 ERA over 29 starts this year, striking out 166 and walking a career-high 57 in 174 1/3 innings. Fried missed time for left forearm neuritis, his seventh straight season on the IL. He had prior IL stints for a blister on middle finger of pitching hand and strained left groin (2018), blister on left index finger (2019), muscle spasm on left side of back (2020), strained right hamstring (2021), concussion (2022), and strained left hamstring, strained left forearm and blister on left index finger (2023). Fried was the seventh overall pick in the 2012 amateur draft by the San Diego. He had Tommy John surgery in August 2014 and was traded to the Braves in December 2014 as part of a six-player deal that sent outfielder Justin Upton to the Padres. He made his major league debut in August 2017 and was optioned to the minors five times in 2018. Fried was 17-6 with a 4.02 ERA in 2019 and 7-0 with a 2.25 ERA in the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, finishing fifth in the National League Cy Young Award voting. He went 14-7 with a 3.04 ERA in 2021, when he pitched six scoreless innings to beat Houston in World Series Game 6, and 14-7 with a 2.48 ERA in 2022, when he made his first All-Star team. Fried was 8-1 with a 2.55 ERA over 14 starts in 2023. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/mlb",

                "content": "William Stephen Belichick (/ˈbɛlɪtʃɪk, ˈbɛlɪtʃɛk/; born April 16, 1952) is an American sports analyst and American football coach. Widely regarded as one of the greatest head coaches of all time,[1][2][3] he holds numerous coaching records, including the record of most Super Bowl wins (six) as a head coach, all with the New England Patriots, along with two more during his time as the defensive coordinator of the New York Giants, for a record eight combined total Super Bowl victories as coach and coordinator.[4] A renowned American football historian, Belichick is often referred to as a \"student of the game\" with a deep knowledge of the intricacies of each player position.[5][6][7][8] During his tenure with the Patriots, Belichick was a central figure as the head coach and de facto general manager during the franchise's dynasty from 2001 to 2019.[9] Belichick is a descendant of the Bill Parcells coaching tree. He began his coaching career in 1975 as an assistant for the Baltimore Colts and became the defensive coordinator for New York Giants head coach Bill Parcells by 1985. Parcells and Belichick won two Super Bowls together before Belichick left to become the head coach of the Cleveland Browns in 1991. He remained in Cleveland for five seasons but was fired following the team's 1995 season. Belichick rejoined Parcells, first in New England where the team lost Super Bowl XXXI, and later with the New York Jets. After being named head coach of the Jets, Belichick resigned after only one day on the job to accept the head coaching job for the Patriots on January 27, 2000. In 24 seasons under Belichick, the Patriots won 17 AFC East division titles, made 13 appearances in the AFC Championship Game, and appeared in nine Super Bowls, with a record six wins. Overall, Belichick has won eight Super Bowl titles (the most of any individual in NFL history) and finished as runner-up four times from his combined time as an assistant and head coach. At the time Belichick left the Patriots, he was the NFL's longest-tenured active head coach. Belichick has the most playoff coaching wins all-time with 31 and ranks third in regular season coaching wins in the NFL with 302.[10] He is also in second place for combined regular season and postseason wins, and also second place for most regular season coaching wins with one franchise.[11] Belichick is one of only three head coaches who have won six NFL titles.[12] He was named the AP NFL Coach of the Year for the 2003, 2007, and 2010 seasons. Belichick has also been selected to the NFL 2000s All-Decade Team, NFL 2010s All-Decade Team, as well as the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team. Belichick was born in Nashville, Tennessee, on April 16, 1952,[13] the son of Jeannette (née Munn) and Steve Belichick.[14] Belichick was named after College Football Hall of Fame coach Bill Edwards, who was his godfather.[15] He is of Croatian ancestry;[16] his paternal grandparents, Marija Barković and Ivan Biličić, emigrated from Draganić in 1897 and settled in Monessen, Pennsylvania, having changed their names to Mary and John Belichick at the suggestion of immigration officers.[17] Belichick was raised in Annapolis, Maryland,[18] where his father was an assistant football coach at the United States Naval Academy. Belichick has said his father is one of his most important football mentors, and Belichick often studied football with him.[19] Bill reportedly learned to break down game films at a young age by watching his father and the Navy staff do their jobs.[20] Belichick graduated from Annapolis High School in 1970, where he was a classmate of Sally Brice-O'Hara, who would later become the Vice Commandant of the Coast Guard.[21][22] While there, Belichick played football and lacrosse, with the latter being his favorite sport.[23] Belichick enrolled at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, for a postgraduate year, with the intention of improving his grades and test scores to be admitted into a quality college.[24] The school honored Belichick 40 years later by inducting him into its Athletics Hall of Honor in 2011.[25] Belichick attended Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, where he played center and tight end. In addition to being a member of the football team, Belichick played lacrosse and squash, serving as the captain of the lacrosse team during his senior season. A member of Chi Psi fraternity,[26] Belichick earned a bachelor's degree in economics in 1975.[27] Eventually, he was part of the inaugural induction class into the university's Athletics Hall of Fame in spring 2008.[28] After graduating, Belichick took a $25-per-week job as an assistant to Baltimore Colts head coach Ted Marchibroda in 1975.[29] In 1976, Belichick joined the Detroit Lions as their assistant special teams coach before adding tight ends and wide receivers to his coaching duties in 1977.[30] Belichick was dismissed along with head coach Tommy Hudspeth and the rest of the coaching staff on January 9, 1978.[31] He spent the 1978 season with the Denver Broncos as their assistant special teams coach and defensive assistant while also serving as director of films.[32][33] In 1979, Belichick began a 12-year stint with the New York Giants alongside head coach Ray Perkins as a defensive assistant and special teams coach.[34] Belichick added linebackers coaching to his duties in 1980 and was named defensive coordinator in 1985 under head coach Bill Parcells, who had replaced Perkins in 1983. The Giants won Super Bowl XXI and Super Bowl XXV following the 1986 and 1990 seasons.[35][36] Belichick's defensive game plan from the New York Giants' 20–19 upset of the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXV has been placed in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[37] From 1991 until 1995, Belichick was the head coach of the Cleveland Browns. During his tenure in Cleveland, Belichick compiled a 36–44 record, leading the team to the playoffs in 1994, his only winning year with the team.[38] Coincidentally, Belichick's lone playoff victory during his Browns tenure was achieved against the New England Patriots, who were coached by former Giants head coach Bill Parcells, in the Wild Card Round during that postseason.[39] In Belichick's final season in Cleveland, the Browns finished 5–11 despite starting 3–1.[40] One of his most controversial moves was cutting quarterback Bernie Kosar midway through the 1993 season. Kosar was signed by the Dallas Cowboys two days later and won a Super Bowl with the Cowboys in Super Bowl XXVIII as a backup. In November 1995, in the middle of the ongoing football season, Browns owner Art Modell had announced he would move his franchise to Baltimore after the season.[41] After first being given assurances that he would coach the new team that would later become the Baltimore Ravens, Belichick was instead fired on February 14, 1996, a week after the shift was officially announced.[42] In the 2013 episode of A Football Life on the Cleveland Browns relocation controversy, many sports journalists who had covered the Browns at the time had said that in retrospective, Belichick had laid the groundwork for the Ravens success in the ensuring decades including their win in Super Bowl XXXV (with Cleveland holdovers Matt Stover and Rob Burnett still with the team at that point), setting up the infrastructure by giving recently retired tight end Ozzie Newsome his first front-office job and had planned on drafting Ray Lewis in the 1996 NFL Draft if Belichick and the team stayed in Cleveland. (Indeed, the newly-christened Ravens did draft Lewis, who went on to a 17-year Hall of Fame career with the team.) Those who had covered the Browns went on to state that if the original Browns had stayed in Cleveland, Belichick would have seen his work through. For his part, Belichick stated that he was able to learn from some mistakes he had made with the Browns while largely sticking to his blueprint from Cleveland when resurrecting the Patriots, such as factoring in off-the-field issues that can affect performance. Among those interviewed, the general consensus was that Belichick's failure in Cleveland was more to do with Modell's financial struggles (even paying a young Scott Pioli only $14,000/year--equivalent to $32,447 in 2024--as a scout) that eventually led the NFL to force the sale of the Ravens to Steve Bisciotti than Belichick's own doing.[43] After his dismissal by the Cleveland Browns, Belichick served under Parcells again as assistant head coach and defensive backs coach with the New England Patriots for the 1996 season. The Patriots finished with an 11–5 record and won the AFC Championship over the Jacksonville Jaguars, but they lost to the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XXXI amid rumors of Parcells's impending defection.[44][45] Belichick had two stints as the head coach of the New York Jets without ever coaching a game. In February 1997, Belichick, who had been an assistant coach under Bill Parcells with the New York Giants and New England Patriots, was named the Jets interim head coach while the Jets and Patriots continued to negotiate compensation to release Parcells from his contract with the Patriots and allow Parcells to coach the Jets.[46] Six days later, the Patriots and Jets reached an agreement that allowed Parcells to coach the Jets, and Belichick became the team's assistant head coach and defensive coordinator.[47] When Parcells stepped down as head coach after the 1999 season, he had already arranged with team management to have Belichick succeed him. However, Belichick was the Jets' head coach for only one day. On January 4, 2000, when Belichick was introduced as head coach to the media—the day after his hiring was publicized—he turned it into a surprise resignation announcement. Before taking the podium, Belichick scrawled a resignation note on a napkin that read, in its entirety, \"I resign as HC of the NYJ.\" He then delivered a half-hour speech explaining his resignation to the assembled press corps.[48] Soon after this bizarre turn of events, Belichick was introduced as the Patriots' 12th full-time head coach, succeeding the recently fired Pete Carroll.[49] The Patriots had inquired to the Jets about permission to interview him for their vacant spot at head coach just prior to Parcells stepping down.[50] Parcells and the Jets claimed that Belichick was still under contract to the Jets, and demanded compensation from the Patriots. NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue agreed, and the Patriots gave the Jets a first-round draft pick in 2000 in exchange for the right to hire Belichick.[51] Soon after hiring Belichick, owner Robert Kraft gave him near-complete control over the team's football operations, making him the de facto general manager as well. Until 2009, Belichick split many of the duties normally held by a general manager on other clubs with player personnel director Scott Pioli, though Belichick had the final say on football matters.[52] Pioli left for the Kansas City Chiefs after the 2008 season.[53] The Patriots went 5–11 in the 2000 regular season and missed the playoffs.[54] In 2001, the Patriots went 11–5 in the regular season, and in the playoffs defeated the Oakland Raiders (in the \"Tuck Rule Game\") and Pittsburgh Steelers on the way to the Super Bowl.[55][56] In Super Bowl XXXVI, Belichick's defense held the St. Louis Rams' offense, which had averaged 31 points during the season, to 17 points, and the Patriots won on a last-second field goal by Adam Vinatieri.[57] The win was the first Super Bowl championship in Patriots history.[58] The following season (2002)—the first in Gillette Stadium—the Patriots went 9–7 and missed the playoffs.[59] New England finished with the same record as the New York Jets and the Miami Dolphins, but the Jets won the AFC East title as a result of the third tiebreaker (record among common opponents).[60] The Patriots' 2003 season started with a 31–0 loss to the Buffalo Bills in Week 1, a few days after they released team defensive captain Lawyer Milloy.[61][62] However, they dominated through the remainder of the season to finish 14–2, setting a new franchise record for wins in a season.[63] In the final week of the regular season, the Patriots avenged their loss to the Bills by the same 31–0 score.[64] They defeated the Tennessee Titans in the divisional round of the playoffs. Playing against the Indianapolis Colts and Co-MVP Peyton Manning in the AFC Championship Game (Steve McNair of the Titans was also Co-MVP), the Patriots recorded four interceptions, and advanced to Super Bowl XXXVIII, where they defeated the Carolina Panthers 32–29 on a late Adam Vinatieri field goal.[65][66] Belichick was awarded the NFL Coach of the Year Award. In 2004, the Patriots once again finished with a 14–2 record, and they defeated the Indianapolis Colts in the divisional round of the playoffs.[67][68] They opened the season at 6–0, which combined with the 15 straight wins to end the previous season, gave New England 21 consecutive victories to break the record for most wins in a row formerly held by the Miami Dolphins with 18 straight victories in the 1972 and 1973 seasons. They defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Championship Game. In Super Bowl XXXIX, the Patriots beat the Philadelphia Eagles and became only the second team to win three Super Bowls in four years.[69][70] Belichick is the only coach to accomplish the feat as the Dallas Cowboys had two head coaches in the stretch they won three of four from 1992 to 1995. With a new defensive coordinator in Eric Mangini and no named offensive coordinator, the Patriots went 10–6 in the 2005 season and defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars in the Wild Card Round before losing to the Denver Broncos in the Divisional Round.[71][72][73] Earlier, with a season-opening win over the Oakland Raiders, Belichick notched his 54th win with the Patriots, passing Mike Holovak as the winningest coach in Patriots history. The Patriots finished with a 12–4 record in the 2006 season and defeated the New York Jets by a score of 37–16 in the Wild Card Round.[74][75] They then beat the San Diego Chargers the next week in the Divisional Round, before losing to the eventual Super Bowl XLI champion Indianapolis Colts in the AFC Championship by a score of 38–34.[76][77] The Patriots led 21–3 midway through the second quarter, but the Colts mounted one of the great comebacks in playoff history.[78] In 2007, Belichick led the Patriots to the first perfect regular season since the introduction of the 16-game regular season schedule in 1978, only the fourth team to do so in National Football League history after the 1934[79] and 1942 Chicago Bears[80] and 1972 Miami Dolphins. In the Divisional Round of the playoffs, they defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars by a score of 31–20. In the AFC Championship, the Patriots defeated the San Diego Chargers by a score of 21–12. The Patriots were upset in Super Bowl XLII 17–14 by the New York Giants, his former team, due to the defense allowing a famous play to David Tyree near the end of regulation.[81] The Patriots' failure to attain a \"perfect season\" (undefeated and untied, including playoffs) preserved the Miami Dolphins as the sole team to do so, having finished their 1972 regular season at 14–0 and having won three games in the playoffs. Only two other teams in professional football have recorded a perfect season—the 1948 Cleveland Browns (14–0) of the then All-America Football Conference and the 1948 Calgary Stampeders (12–0) of the Canadian Football League. No team in the former American Football League ever had a perfect season. During the Patriots' 2008 season-opener against the Kansas City Chiefs, quarterback Tom Brady sustained a season-ending injury in the first quarter.[82] Backup quarterback Matt Cassel was named the starter for the remainder of the season. However, with a win in Week 2, the Patriots broke their own record for regular season wins in a row with 21 (2006–08). After losing over 12 players to the injured reserve list, including Rodney Harrison, Adalius Thomas, and Laurence Maroney, the Patriots still managed their league-leading eighth consecutive season with a winning record, going 11–5.[83] However, the Patriots, who finished second in the AFC East, missed the playoffs for the first time since 2002, losing on tiebreakers to the Miami Dolphins (who won the division on the fourth tiebreaker, better conference record) and the Baltimore Ravens (who beat out the Patriots for the last playoff spot due to a better conference record).[84] The 1985 Denver Broncos are the only other 11-win team to miss the playoffs in a 16-game season.[85] In 2009, with a fully healthy Tom Brady back as the starting quarterback, Belichick was able to guide the Patriots to yet another AFC East division title with a 10–6 record.[86] However, the Patriots lost to the Baltimore Ravens in the Wild Card Round.[87] In an incident dubbed \"Spygate\",[88] on September 9, 2007, NFL security caught a Patriots video assistant taping the New York Jets' defensive signals from the sidelines, which is not an approved location. The NFL rules state: \"No video recording devices of any kind are permitted to be in use in the coaches' booth, on the field, or in the locker room during the game.\" Jets coach Eric Mangini, a former Patriots assistant, tipped off league officials that the Patriots might have been filming their signals. After the game, the Jets formally complained to the league. On September 13, the NFL fined Belichick $500,000—the largest fine ever imposed on a coach in the league's 87-year history,[89] and fined the Patriots $250,000. Additionally, the Patriots forfeited their first-round draft pick in the 2008 NFL draft. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, a former employee of the Jets, said that he fined the Patriots as a team because Belichick exercises so much control over the Patriots' on-field operations that \"his actions and decisions are properly attributed to the club.\" Goodell considered suspending Belichick but decided that taking away draft picks would be more severe in the long run.[90] Gary Myers, a columnist for New York's Daily News columnist, stated Belichick should have been suspended by Goodell for the Patriots' next game against the Jets.[91] Belichick later issued the following statement: I accept full responsibility for the actions that led to tonight's ruling. Once again, I apologize to the Kraft family and every person directly or indirectly associated with the New England Patriots for the embarrassment, distraction and penalty my mistake caused. I also apologize to Patriots fans and would like to thank them for their support during the past few days and throughout my career. [...] As the Commissioner acknowledged, our use of sideline video had no impact on the outcome of last week's game. We have never used sideline video to obtain a competitive advantage while the game was in progress. [...] Part of my job as head coach is to ensure that our football operations are conducted in compliance of the league rules and all accepted interpretations of them. My interpretation of a rule in the Constitution and Bylaws was incorrect. [...] With tonight's resolution, I will not be offering any further comments on this matter. We are moving on with our preparations for Sunday's game. The sanctions against Belichick were the harshest imposed on a head coach in league history until the New Orleans Saints' Sean Payton was suspended for the entire 2012 season for covering up a scheme in which bounties were paid for deliberately knocking opponents out of games. Following the incident and its fallout, Belichick led the Patriots to a perfect 16–0 regular season record, and was awarded the 2007 NFL Coach of the Year Award, as voted on by the Associated Press.[92] In the 2010 season, Belichick and the Patriots finished with a 14–2 record for the top seed in the AFC.[93] However, their postseason ended quickly with a 28–21 loss to the New York Jets in the divisional round.[94] In the 2011 season, the Patriots topped the AFC with a 13–3 record.[95] Following a victory over the Denver Broncos in the divisional round of the playoffs, the Patriots won the AFC Championship game, beating the Baltimore Ravens 23–20 when the Ravens failed to score a touchdown and Baltimore's kicker, Billy Cundiff, missed a routine 32-yard field goal attempt to tie the game and send it into overtime.[96][97] This sent New England to their fifth Super Bowl under Belichick. In Super Bowl XLVI, the Patriots lost in the Super Bowl XLII rematch to the New York Giants by a score of 21–17.[98] On September 26, 2012, following a 31–30 loss to the Baltimore Ravens, Belichick was fined $50,000 for grabbing a replacement official's arm while asking for more specific clarity on a ruling after Baltimore had narrowly converted a last-second field goal attempt to secure the win.[99] The Patriots finished the 2012 regular season with a 12–4 record. In the divisional round of the playoffs, they defeated the Houston Texans by a score of 41–28 and made it to the AFC Championship Game, where they lost to the eventual Super Bowl XLVII champion Baltimore Ravens by a score of 28–13, ending their season.[100][101] The Patriots began the 2013 season with much upheaval on the offensive side of the ball with the injury of Rob Gronkowski, the arrest and subsequent release of Aaron Hernandez, the departures of Wes Welker to the Denver Broncos and Danny Woodhead to the San Diego Chargers in free agency, and the release of Brandon Lloyd. To replace them, the Patriots signed Danny Amendola in free agency, drafted rookies Aaron Dobson and Josh Boyce, and signed undrafted rookie free agent Kenbrell Thompkins. The team finished the season with a 12–4 record, winning the AFC East and securing a playoff berth and a first-round bye, seeding second in the AFC standings.[102] In the Divisional Round, they defeated the Indianapolis Colts by a score of 43–22.[103] They lost to the Denver Broncos in the AFC Championship Game by a score of 26–16.[104] In the 2014 season, Belichick's Patriots started 2–2. At a mid-week press conference following a 41–14 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, Belichick famously uttered, \"We're on to Cincinnati\" (referring to the Patriots' next opponent), several times in response to follow-up questions and criticisms of his team, Brady in particular.[105] Ultimately, they recorded a 12–4 record for the third straight season.[106] In the Divisional Round, they defeated the Baltimore Ravens by a score of 35–31.[107] During the AFC Championship Game, they defeated the Indianapolis Colts by a score of 45–7.[108] They reached Super Bowl XLIX, where they defeated the Seattle Seahawks by a score of 28–24.[109] With his fourth championship as head coach, Belichick tied Chuck Noll for most Super Bowl wins by a head coach.[110] In the 2015 season, the Patriots recorded a 12–4 record for the fourth straight season.[111] They defeated the Kansas City Chiefs in the Divisional Round by a score of 27–20.[112] During the AFC Championship Game, the Patriots narrowly lost to the eventual Super Bowl 50 champion Denver Broncos by a score of 20–18.[113] In the 2016 season, the Patriots recorded a 14–2 record, which earned them the #1 seed for the AFC playoffs.[114] In the Divisional Round, they defeated the Houston Texans by a score of 34–16.[115] During the AFC Championship Game, they defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers by a score of 36–17.[116] They reached Super Bowl LI, where they defeated the Atlanta Falcons in a comeback victory by a score of 34–28 in overtime.[117] The Patriots were down 28–3 at one point in the third quarter.[118] With the victory, Belichick won his record fifth Super Bowl title as a head coach.[119] In the 2017 season, the Patriots went 13–3, setting an NFL record eighth consecutive 12-or-more-win seasons, capturing their ninth consecutive AFC East title and their 15th of the last 17 seasons. They defeated the Tennessee Titans in the Divisional Round by a score of 35–14 and the Jacksonville Jaguars in the AFC Championship Game by a score of 24–20, claiming their second consecutive AFC title, while also extending their record of consecutive AFC Championship Game appearances with seven.[120][121] Super Bowl LII was Belichick's eighth title game as head coach and his eleventh overall in any capacity, which was also the Patriots' tenth appearance, all extending NFL records. The Ringer wrote that Belichick's \"team is different from many of New England's famous teams from the previous decade: The first iteration of the Patriots dynasty relied on defense. This year, they are 29th in yards allowed (though fifth in points allowed) and instead have perfected the art of situational football.\" The latter Patriots teams were noted for mounting late comebacks in playoff games.[122][123] However, the Patriots fell to the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LII, 41–33, as Eagles quarterback Nick Foles repeated his dominant NFC Championship Game performance and led Philadelphia to victory in a high-scoring game. The Patriots were down early, as they had been in most of their Super Bowl wins. However, they could not make a comeback this time, although they came very close. Eagles defensive end Brandon Graham strip-sacked Tom Brady to get the ball back with about two minutes to go in the fourth quarter. The Patriots did get the ball again before the end of the game, but they ran out of time to score.[124] In the 2018 season, the Patriots went 11–5, failing to win 12 or more games for the first time since 2009. Despite this, they still captured their 10th consecutive AFC East title and their 16th of the last 18 years. They defeated the Los Angeles Chargers in the Divisional Round by a score of 41–28 and the Kansas City Chiefs during the AFC Championship Game 37–31 in a tough overtime game in Kansas City to advance to their third straight Super Bowl.[125][126] In Super Bowl LIII, the Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams 13–3 to give Belichick his sixth Super Bowl championship as a head coach and his eighth overall to have the most Super Bowl rings in NFL history. His six championships matched both George Halas and Curly Lambeau for most championships as a head coach. The Patriots' defense held the high-scoring Rams offense to only 260 total yards.[127][128] On May 13, 2019, Belichick announced that he would assume another role as the Patriots' defensive coordinator starting the 2019 season.[129] On October 27, 2019, with the Patriots' win over the Cleveland Browns, Belichick obtained his 300th win, regular and postseason combined, as a head coach.[130] The Patriots finished the 2019 regular season with a 12–4 record, winning their 11th consecutive AFC East title.[131] However, the Patriots were defeated in the Wild Card Round of the playoffs by the Tennessee Titans, led by former Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel, by a score of 20–13.[132] Following the departure of Tom Brady to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Belichick and the Patriots were faced with an uncertain quarterback situation for the first time in nearly two decades.[133] During the offseason, the Patriots signed former Carolina Panthers starter Cam Newton for the 2020 NFL season.[134] The off-season routines and schedules, as well as the normal processes of regular season were severely disrupted by the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the unanticipated difficulties and challenges of the pandemic, the Patriots were in the hunt for a playoff spot until late in the season, ultimately finishing 7–9. The 2020 season was Belichick's first losing season since his first year in New England.[135] In the 2021 NFL draft, the Patriots selected quarterback Mac Jones with the 15th overall pick.[136] After Jones and Newton competed for the starting job during the preseason, Belichick made the decision to release Newton and name Jones the starter for the upcoming season.[137][138] During Week 4, Brady's Tampa Bay Buccaneers visited the Patriots in his first trip to Gillette Stadium since signing with the Buccaneers. A missed 56-yard field goal by Patriots kicker Nick Folk allowed Tampa Bay to narrowly escape with a 19–17 victory.[139] Immediately after the game, Brady and Belichick shared a quick embrace on the field before Brady greeted his former teammates and other members of the Patriots organization.[140] Though fans criticized Belichick for his lack of warmth displayed towards his former quarterback, the two privately spoke at length in the Buccaneers locker room following the match.[141] Belichick helped lead the Patriots to a 10–7 record in 2021. The team fell to the Buffalo Bills in the Wild Card Round by a score of 47–17.[142] In the 2022 season, despite starting quarterback Mac Jones being injured in Week 3 and subsequently missing three more weeks, the Patriots remained in the hunt for a playoff spot until the last week, finishing with a record of 8–9.[143][144] During Week 4 of the 2023 season, the Patriots lost to the Dallas Cowboys by a score of 38–3.[145] In doing so, Belichick suffered the worst loss of his coaching career (35 points).[146] The following week, the Patriots lost to the Saints by a score of 34–0, giving Belichick his worst home loss of his career.[147] Two weeks later, New England upset the Buffalo Bills 29–25 to earn Belichick his 300th career regular season win as an NFL head coach.[148] After a Week 10 10–6 loss to the Indianapolis Colts in Germany and subsequent bye week, Belichick named Bailey Zappe the team's starting quarterback.[149] In Belichick's final game with New England, the Patriots lost to the New York Jets 17–3, snapping the team's 15-game winning streak over the Jets. The Patriots finished the season with a 4–13 record, the team's worst in Belichick's 24 seasons as head coach.[150] On January 11, 2024, Belichick and the Patriots mutually agreed to part ways.[151] On January 15, Belichick was interviewed by the Atlanta Falcons for their head coaching position, but ultimately did not get the job as the Falcons hired Raheem Morris instead.[152] Under Belichick, the Patriots had a regular-season record of 266–121–0 over 24 seasons.[153] Belichick is the most successful coach in Patriots history; his 266 wins with the franchise are more than quadruple those of runner-up Mike Holovak.[154] Belichick also compiled a 30–12 record in the playoffs with New England, including a 6–3 record in Super Bowls. He led the Patriots to 17 divisional titles, including five consecutive titles from 2003 to 2007 and eleven consecutive titles from 2009 to 2019. This streak of 11 consecutive playoff appearances is the most in NFL history for any team.[155] While still serving as head coach for the Patriots in 2019, Belichick appeared as one of three main analysts, alongside host Rich Eisen and Cris Collinsworth, for the NFL 100 All-Time Team series on NFL Network, serving as a voter, in addition to providing his analysis of each member's significance and breaking down tape of highlight plays. Belichick was chosen in these roles due to his exceptional knowledge of American football, to the extent that he and fellow former head coach John Madden were specifically assigned to look over film of the earliest players selected to the team.[156] Belichick was awarded a Sports Emmy in 2021 for his contributions to the series.[157] After mutually parting ways with the Patriots in 2024, Belichick, while still declaring himself an active head coach, officially agreed to appear every Monday afternoon during the 2024 NFL season with ESPN's The Pat McAfee Show, first appearing as an analyst on the show during its \"5th Annual Draft Spectacular\", covering the 2024 NFL draft, following a guest appearance weeks prior.[158][159] \"I can't tell you the advantage to having a defensive coach to take the quarterback behind the ropes on that defense, it made me a better quarterback, so Bill's gonna do that. I think the audience is going to be fascinated at how smart he is. Look, you guys saw how witty he is. I watched the Draft show you guys did; it was awesome. He's quick-witted, he's funny and like I said, he's brilliant when it comes to defense and offense, the guy can flat-out coach.\"[160] –Peyton Manning on Belichick as an analyst, May 2024 Peyton Manning revealed during the Netflix special The Roast of Tom Brady that Belichick would join another ESPN program, joining the Manning brothers (Peyton and Eli) in the Manningcast, an alternate live television broadcast of Monday Night Football.[161] A week afterward, Manning stated during an appearance on The Pat McAfee Show that Belichick would appear on every Manningcast broadcast during the 2024 season.[160] Coaching record accurate as of final week of the 2023 NFL season.[162] Bill Belichick has worked under six head coaches: Twenty of Belichick's assistant coaches have become NFL or NCAA head coaches (not including interim tenures): During the offseason, Belichick visits other football programs to learn from their experiences. For example, he has studied the Navy run offense, sought Bill Walsh (in past years) to understand more about the San Francisco 49ers as an organization and the West Coast offense as a system,[190] and spent time with Jimmy Johnson to learn about drafting and contract negotiations.[191] The track record of Belichick's coaching tree has been characterized as poor. Former assistant coaches under Belichick had a combined 208–296–1 (.413) record as head coaches of their own teams through November 28, 2020, and a number of them ended their brief tenures as head coaches by being fired midseason.[192] As of the end of the 2020 season, the only members of this coaching tree to have career NFL head coaching records above .500 were former coaches Groh (9–7) and O'Brien (52–48 during season, 2–4 in playoffs).[193] Nick Saban and Belichick are good friends. In 2007, when Belichick spoke about their relationship, he said: \"Two successful Croats in the same division of NFL. You must admit, you don't see that every day.\"[194] In May 2018, President Donald Trump appointed Belichick to be a member of his Council on Sports, Fitness & Nutrition.[195] Belichick has an Alaskan Klee Kai dog named Nike.[196] Interest in the breed surged after Nike made an appearance on camera during the 2020 NFL draft.[197] Belichick has dual Croatian/American citizenship.[198] He received Croatian citizenship on June 3, 2024, in Banski dvori in Zagreb from the Croatian prime minister Andrej Plenković.[199] He was also special guest of the association football friendly match on Stadion Rujevica between Croatia and North Macedonia.[200] Belichick was married to Debby Clarke from 1977 to 2006.[201][202] They have three children. Their daughter Amanda played lacrosse at Wesleyan University, and she is the head women's lacrosse coach at the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts in July 2015.[203] Their son Stephen played lacrosse and football at Rutgers University, served as an assistant coach with the Patriots, and is currently the defensive coordinator for the University of Washington.[204] Their son Brian is an assistant coach with the Patriots.[205] Starting in 2007, Belichick was in a relationship with Linda Holliday, the executive director of the Bill Belichick Foundation.[206][207] The relationship ended in 2023. In June 2024, it was reported that Belichick was in a relationship with Jordon Hudson, who is a 24-year-old former cheerleader.[208] On January 10, 2021, Politico reported then-President Donald Trump planned to award Belichick the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[209] Belichick indicated that he was flattered to be considered for the honor, but declined the award in a statement issued the next day.[210] His statement referenced the January 6 United States Capitol attack, which the House of Representatives had accused Trump of provoking when it impeached for the second time of his presidency, and cited Belichick's \"great reverence for our nation's values, freedom and democracy\" in light of that event.[211][212] A number of Massachusetts politicians, including Senator Ed Markey and Representative Jim McGovern, had previously called on him to decline after news of the award became public.[213] # denotes interim head coach # denotes de facto general manager # denotes interim head coach # denotes de facto general manager",

                "content": "NEW! Find where to watch all of your favorite sports! Adam Schefter appears on \"SportsCenter\" to talk about Bill Belichick's intention to coach next year after interviewing with North Carolina. (1:05) Bill Belichick, who won six Super Bowl championships with the New England Patriots, has had discussions with North Carolina about the Tar Heels' head-coaching job, sources told ESPN on Thursday. Belichick, 72, has been out of football this year after leaving the Patriots following the 2023 season. Sources told ESPN that Belichick, who has spent his career in the NFL, wants to coach again and is open to listening to people at the college and NFL level. UNC fired Mack Brown on Nov. 26 after six seasons with the Tar Heels. The 73-year-old Brown, a College Football Hall of Famer, was in his second stint at the school. Belichick is only a year younger than Brown, who was the oldest coach in the FBS this season. The Tar Heels went 44-33 under Brown from 2019 to 2024 and finished 6-6 this season. Brown will not coach in UNC's bowl game, and Freddie Kitchens, a former Cleveland Browns coach who has served as UNC's run game coordinator and tight ends coach the past two seasons, is serving as interim head coach while the school seeks a replacement. Belichick is far and away the biggest name to surface in the North Carolina search, and sources said there was genuine interest on both sides. But Tulane's Jon Sumrall was also at or near the top of North Carolina's list and was expected to speak formally with school officials after the Green Wave's AAC championship game against Army on Friday. Other candidates for the job include Iowa State's Matt Campbell, Georgia defensive coordinator Glenn Schumann, and Steve Wilks, who was the Arizona Cardinals' head coach in 2018 and the Carolina Panthers' interim head coach in 2022. Wilks was a volunteer assistant this season at Charlotte. North Carolina had initially targeted Pittsburgh Steelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith, a UNC graduate, but he declined the Tar Heels' overtures and instead wanted to remain in the NFL. During Belichick's hiatus from coaching, he has made the media rounds this season. He's a regular on the \"ManningCast\" during ESPN's \"Monday Night Football\" and \"The Pat McAfee Show\" on ESPN and also part of the \"Inside the NFL\" crew on the CW Network. Belichick was with the Patriots for 24 seasons. He was also a part of two Super Bowl-winning teams with the New York Giants as Bill Parcells' defensive coordinator. Belichick's 333 wins as a head coach are second all time in the NFL to Don Shula's 347. Although Belichick never has coached in college, his father, Steve, was a longtime assistant at the U.S. Naval Academy, and Belichick grew up in Annapolis, Maryland. InsideCarolina.com was the first to report that Belichick had interviewed with UNC. Information from ESPN's Adam Schefter was used in this report.",

Hudson met the six-time Super Bowl champion on a flight where they discussed psychology, and they remained in touch with each other afterwards, before reportedly beginning dating sometime in 2022. \"[Belichick] couldn't care less about the age difference because he appreciates Jordon for the woman that she is,\" a source told PageSix.com. \"Jordon is an old soul so she and Bill connect on a deep level. \"Age is just a number to them. [They] don't listen to the haters because their relationship is the real deal. [They] don't care what anybody thinks.\" Their relationship has largely remained out of the spotlight due to Belichick's forced sabbatical from the NFL when the Patriots axed him as their head coach and general manager after two decades in the role. Whilst he is listed as an active coach, he currently is not registered to any team and works as a pundit for FOX Sports and often collaborates with Pat McAfee. The 72-year-old recently made his red carpet debut with his beau as they attended The Museum Gala at New York City's American Museum of Natural History on December 5 and now an insider reports his passionate defense of her. The young woman and senior citizen have bonded over their shared love of football, as well as nature and the outdoor world and despite criticism, they are said to genuinely like each other. \"Bill was so proud to have Jordon by his side,\" the insider tells PageSix.com of the trip to the Museum. \"They have a genuine connection and mutual respect for one another. \"[They] connect on so many levels despite what some may think.

                "content": "Blue Ivy Carter (born January 7, 2012) is an American actress. She is the first-born daughter of musicians Beyoncé and Jay-Z. Two days after her birth, Time dubbed Carter \"the most famous baby in the world.\"[1] That same day, her breathing, cries and coos were featured on the song \"Glory\", by her father Jay-Z, which earned her a Guinness World Record for being the youngest person to have a charted song on any Billboard chart.[2][3] She has been the subject of depictions in media, including impersonations on Saturday Night Live and RuPaul's Drag Race. In 2019, she was featured on \"Brown Skin Girl\", a single by her mother Beyoncé, alongside Wizkid and Saint Jhn.[4] The song won her accolades including an NAACP Image Award;[5] the BET Her Award, making her the youngest winner of a BET Award; and a Grammy Award for Best Music Video for the same song,[6] which earned her another Guinness World Record for being the youngest individually credited Grammy Award winner,[7] and the second youngest overall.[8] Carter is slated to make her feature film debut in 2024 in Mufasa: The Lion King, as a voice actress portraying Princess Kiara.[9] On August 28, 2011, Beyoncé's pregnancy was announced during her performance of \"Love On Top\" at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards.[10] She finished the performance by unbuttoning her blazer and rubbing her stomach to confirm the pregnancy.[11] Blue Ivy Carter was born on January 7, 2012, to Beyoncé and Jay-Z at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, New York.[12] CBS wrote Carter was \"Arguably the world's most famous baby, aside from Prince George and North West\", the eldest child of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.[13] Two days after her birth, Time dubbed Carter \"the most famous baby in the world.\"[1] Since her birth, her parents have \"worked to secure trademarks of their daughter's name for everything, including books, shampoos, video games, and more.\"[14] Beyoncé argued Carter is a \"cultural icon\" during the trademark process.[15] Through her mother, Carter is a granddaughter of Tina and Mathew Knowles,[16][17] a first cousin once removed of Angela Beyincé,[18] and a niece of singer Solange Knowles.[19] Media attention has been focused on Carter from birth because of her famous parents and extended family. In 2018, Carter attended first grade at the Center for Early Education, a private school in West Hollywood, California.[20] Dubbed the \"New Princess of Pop\" by Rolling Stone, Carter was featured gurgling and crying on her father's single \"Glory\", a song released to celebrate her two days after her birth.[21][1] Because of \"Glory\", Carter is the youngest person to ever chart on the Billboard charts.[22][23] In 2015, Carter appeared as part of the choir on the Coldplay song \"Up&Up\" from their album A Head Full of Dreams.[24][25] In 2020, Carter sang on the track \"Brown Skin Girl\", earning accolades and awards for the performance. She was the youngest recipient of a BET Award when she received the BET Her Award.

Cherry's book Hair Love about an African American father doing his daughter's hair for the first time.[28][29] Variety posited \"there's a chance she could contend for a Grammy nomination for spoken word.\"[30] On January 21, 2023, Carter joined her mother onstage to sing \"Brown Skin Girl\" for the first time, as Beyoncé performed at a private show in Dubai.[31] Beginning May 26, 2023, Carter joined the Renaissance World Tour as a dancer and danced to \"My Power\" and \"Black Parade\" with her mother.[32] In 2012, Hvar, Croatia named Carter an honorary citizen.

Vanity Fair writer K. Austin Collins and Harper's Bazaar web editor Violet Lucca criticized Carter's physical appearance. Both apologized and deleted their posts after backlash.[37][38] In February 2012, a skit on Saturday Night Live depicted a baby Carter being serenaded by Bon Iver (played by Justin Timberlake).[39] In January 2013, a skit on the same series depicted Carter's crib, which was \"lined with one of Diana Ross's finest wigs\".[40] In 2018, Carter was the subject of an impersonation by drag queen The Vixen on the Snatch Game episode on Season 10 of RuPaul's Drag Race.

                "content": "clockThis article was published more than 12 years ago Little Blue Ivy Carter, daughter of Beyonce and Jay-Z, is less than 48 hours old, but she's already generating conspiracy theories, promotional opportunities and strong opinions. Let's start with the name for the wee \"Single Lady.\" Opinions on Blue Ivy from Celebritology readers ranged from the approving (\"I love the name! It fits with the celebrity style!\" wrote Dancer5) to the bluntly unimpressed (\"It's a stupid name,\" noted bevjames). But this blog's commenters failed to mention the theory that somehow Blue Ivy's name proves Beyonce and Jay-Z are members of the Illuminati, the underground organization attempting to create a New World Order. (You may remember it from Dan Brown's \"Angels and Demons,\" a work of fiction that also presents much information that should be taken at face value and assumed as gospel.) What does Blue Ivy have to do with the Illuminati? Why, the name Ivy is just an acronym for Illuminati’s Very Youngest, of course. Or so online conspiracy theorists have been saying. There are other online theories floating around that seem flat-out ridiculous, including some that purport that the innocent girl's name actually means Lucifer's daughter when spelled backwards. (It doesn't.) A more legitimate explanation for the name comes courtesy of People and other outlets, which points out that \"Blue\" may be a reference to Jay-Z's \"Blueprint\" albums, and Ivy may be a riff on the number four, a lucky one for Beyonce and her husband. (IV is, of course, the roman numeral four.) It’s also entirely possible that the couple chose the name because they just like the sound of it, or because that’s what happened to come out of their mouths when the doctor asked for a name, or because they feel really strongly that their child should attend an Ivy League — or at least a public ivy — university 18 years from now. We don't know for sure because, hey, guess what? They still have not officially confirmed the birth of the child themselves, even though it's pretty clear that Blue Ivy is indeed swaddled somewhere in the great state of New York as we speak. While we await the moment when Beyonce inevitably opens up a blazer to reveal Blue Ivy in a luxury Baby Bjorn, we can always continue to imagine what she must look like ourselves. Forensic artist Joe Mullins (via News.com.au) has already provided a sneak peek at how Blue may look a few years from now. She’s got secret Illuminati member written all over her non-real face, doesn’t she?",

                "title": "UEFA Champions League - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The UEFA Champions League (abbreviated as UCL) is an annual club association football competition organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) that is contested by top-division European clubs. The competition begins with a round robin league phase to qualify for the double-legged knockout rounds, and a single-leg final. It is the most-watched club competition in the world and the third most-watched football competition overall, behind only the UEFA European Championship and the FIFA World Cup. It is one of the most prestigious football tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national league champions (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of their national associations. Introduced in 1955 as the Coupe des Clubs Champions Européens (French for European Champion Clubs' Cup), and commonly known as the European Cup, it was initially a straight knockout tournament open only to the champions of Europe's domestic leagues, with its winner reckoned as the European club champion. The competition took on its current name in 1992, adding a round-robin group stage in 1991 and allowing multiple entrants from certain countries since the 1997–98 season.[1] While only the winners of many of Europe's national leagues can enter the competition, the top 5 leagues by coefficient provide four teams each by default,[2] with a possibility for additional spots based on performance during the previous season.[3][4] Clubs that finish below the qualifying spots are eligible for the second-tier UEFA Europa League competition, and since 2021, for the third-tier UEFA Conference League.[5] In its present format, the Champions League begins in early July with three qualifying rounds and a play-off round, all played over two legs. The seven surviving teams enter the league phase, joining 29 teams qualified in advance. The 36 teams each play eight opponents, four home and four away. The 24 highest-ranked teams proceed to the knockout phase that culminates with the final match in late May or early June.[6] The winner of the Champions League automatically qualifies for the following year's Champions League, the UEFA Super Cup, the FIFA Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup.[7][8] Spanish clubs have the most victories (20 wins), followed by England (15 wins) and Italy (12 wins). England has the most winning teams, with six clubs having won the title. The competition has been won by 23 clubs and 13 of them have won it more than once.[9] Real Madrid is the most successful club in the tournament's history, having won it 15 times. Madrid is the only club to have won it five times in a row (the first five editions).[10] Only one club has won all of their matches in a single tournament en route to the tournament victory: Bayern Munich in the 2019–20 season.[11] Real Madrid is the current European champion, having beaten Borussia Dortmund 2–0 in the 2024 final for their fifteenth title. The first time the champions of two European leagues met was in what was nicknamed the 1895 World Championship, when English champions Sunderland beat Scottish champions Heart of Midlothian 5–3.[12] The first pan-European tournament was the Challenge Cup, a competition between clubs in the Austro-Hungarian Empire.[13] Three years later, in 1900, the champions of Belgium, Netherlands and Switzerland, which were the only existing leagues in continental Europe at the time, participated in the Coupe Van der Straeten Ponthoz, thus being dubbed as the \"club championship of the continent\" by the local newspapers.[14][15] The Mitropa Cup, a competition modelled after the Challenge Cup, was created in 1927, an idea of Austrian Hugo Meisl, and played between Central European clubs.[16] In 1930, the Coupe des Nations (French: Nations Cup), the first attempt to create a cup for national champion clubs of Europe, was played and organised by Swiss club Servette.[17] Held in Geneva, it brought together ten champions from across the continent. The tournament was won by Újpest of Hungary.[17] Latin European nations came together to form the Latin Cup in 1949.[18] After receiving reports from his journalists over the highly successful South American Championship of Champions of 1948, Gabriel Hanot, editor of L'Équipe, began proposing the creation of a continent-wide tournament.[19] In interviews, Jacques Ferran (one of the founders of the European Champions Cup, together with Gabriel Hanot),[20] said that the South American Championship of Champions was the inspiration for the European Champions Cup.[21] After Stan Cullis declared Wolverhampton Wanderers \"Champions of the World\" following a successful run of friendlies in the 1950s, in particular a 3–2 friendly victory against Budapest Honvéd, Hanot finally managed to convince UEFA to put into practice such a tournament.[1] It was conceived in Paris in 1955 as the European Champion Clubs' Cup.[1] The first European Cup took place during the 1955–56 season.[22][23] Sixteen teams participated (some by invitation): AC Milan (Italy), AGF Aarhus (Denmark), Anderlecht (Belgium), Djurgården (Sweden), Gwardia Warszawa (Poland), Hibernian (Scotland), Partizan (Yugoslavia), PSV Eindhoven (Netherlands), Rapid Wien (Austria), Real Madrid (Spain), Rot-Weiss Essen (West Germany), Saarbrücken (Saar), Servette (Switzerland), Sporting CP (Portugal), Reims (France) and Vörös Lobogó (Hungary).[22][23] The first European Cup match took place on 4 September 1955, and ended in a 3–3 draw between Sporting CP and Partizan.[22][23] The first goal in European Cup history was scored by João Baptista Martins of Sporting CP.[22][23] The inaugural final took place at the Parc des Princes between Stade de Reims and Real Madrid on 13 June 1956.[22][23][24] The Spanish squad came back from behind to win 4–3 thanks to goals from Alfredo Di Stéfano and Marquitos, as well as two goals from Héctor Rial.[22][23][24] Real Madrid successfully defended the trophy next season in their home stadium, the Santiago Bernabéu, against Fiorentina.[25][26] After a scoreless first half, Real Madrid scored twice in six minutes to defeat the Italians.[24][25][26] In 1958, Milan failed to capitalise after going ahead on the scoreline twice, only for Real Madrid to equalise.[27][28] The final, held in Heysel Stadium, went to extra time where Francisco Gento scored the game-winning goal to allow Real Madrid to retain the title for the third consecutive season.[24][27][28] In a rematch of the first final, Real Madrid faced Stade Reims at the Neckarstadion for the 1959 final, and won 2–0.[24][29][30] West German side Eintracht Frankfurt became the first team not to compete in the Latin cup to reach the European Cup final.[18][31][32] The 1960 final holds the record for the most goals scored, with Real Madrid beating Eintracht Frankfurt 7–3 at Hampden Park, courtesy of four goals by Ferenc Puskás and a hat-trick by Alfredo Di Stéfano.[24][31][32] This was Real Madrid's fifth consecutive title, a record that still stands today.[9] Real Madrid's reign ended in the 1960–61 season when bitter rivals Barcelona dethroned them in the first round.[33][34] Barcelona were defeated in the final by Portuguese side Benfica 3–2 at the Wankdorf Stadium.[33][34][35] Reinforced by Eusébio, Benfica defeated Real Madrid 5–3 at the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam and kept the title for a second consecutive season.[35][36][37] Benfica wanted to repeat Real Madrid's successful run of the 1950s after reaching the showpiece event of the 1962–63 European Cup, but a brace from Brazilian-Italian José Altafini at Wembley gave the spoils to Milan, making the trophy leave the Iberian Peninsula for the first time ever.[38][39][40] Inter Milan beat an ageing Real Madrid 3–1 at the Ernst-Happel-Stadion to win the 1963–64 season and replicate their local-rival's success.[41][42][43] The title stayed in Milan for the third year in a row after Inter beat Benfica 1–0 at their home ground, the San Siro.[44][45][46] Under the leadership of Jock Stein, Scottish club Celtic beat Inter Milan 2–1 in the 1967 final to become the first British club to win the European Cup.[47][48] The Celtic players that day, all of whom were born within 30 miles (48 km) of Glasgow, subsequently became known as the \"Lisbon Lions\".[49] The 1967–68 season saw Manchester United become the first English team to win the European Cup, beating two-times winners Benfica 4–1 in the final.[50] This final came ten years after the Munich air disaster, which had claimed the lives of eight United players and left their manager, Matt Busby, fighting for his life.[51] In the 1968–69 season, Ajax became the first Dutch team to reach the European Cup final, but they were beaten 4–1 by Milan, who claimed their second European Cup, with Pierino Prati scoring a hat-trick.[52] The 1969–70 season saw the first Dutch winners of the competition. Feyenoord knocked out the defending champions, Milan in the second round,[53] before beating Celtic in the final.[54] In the 1970–71 season, Ajax won the title, beating Greek side Panathinaikos in the final.[55] the season saw a number of changes, with penalty shoot-outs being introduced, and the away goals rule being changed so that it would be used in all rounds except the final.[56] It was also the first time a Greek team reached the final, as well as the first season that Real Madrid failed to qualify, having finished sixth in La Liga the previous season.[57] Ajax went on to win the competition three years in row (1971 to 1973), which Bayern Munich emulated from 1974 to 1976, before Liverpool won their first two titles in 1977 and 1978.[58] The following seasons saw victories in 1978–79 and 1979–80 for Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest. The following year Liverpool won their third title before Aston Villa continued the sense of English dominance in 1982. In 1982–83, Hamburger SV broke the English dominance. Liverpool regained it in 1983–84 before losing to Juventus (1984–85); Steaua București then won in 1985–86, Porto in 1986–87, PSV Eindhoven in 1987–88; Milan (2), Red Star Belgrade and Barcelona became champions before the competition was re-formulated as the UEFA Champions League. All English clubs were banned for five years (Liverpool for six years) following the 1985 European Cup final due to the Heysel Stadium disaster. \"Magic...it's magic above all else. When you hear the anthem it captivates you straight away.\" The UEFA Champions League anthem, officially titled simply as \"Champions League\", was written by Tony Britten, and is an adaptation of George Frideric Handel's 1727 anthem Zadok the Priest (one of his Coronation Anthems).[60][61] UEFA commissioned Britten in 1992 to arrange an anthem, and the piece was performed by London's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and sung by the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields.[60] Stating that \"the anthem is now almost as iconic as the trophy\", UEFA's official website adds it is \"known to set the hearts of many of the world's top footballers aflutter\".[60] The chorus contains the three official languages used by UEFA: English, German, and French.[62] The climactic moment is set to the exclamations 'Die Meister! Die Besten! Les Grandes Équipes! The Champions!'.[63] The anthem's chorus is played before each UEFA Champions League game as the two teams are lined up, as well as at the beginning and end of television broadcasts of the matches. In addition to the anthem, there is also entrance music, which contains parts of the anthem itself, which is played as teams enter the field.[64] The complete anthem is about three minutes long, and has two short verses and the chorus.[62] Special vocal versions have been performed live at the Champions League final with lyrics in other languages, changing over to the host nation's language for the chorus. These versions were performed by Andrea Bocelli (Italian; Rome 2009, Milan 2016 and Cardiff 2017), Juan Diego Flores (Spanish; Madrid 2010), All Angels (Wembley 2011), Jonas Kaufmann and David Garrett (Munich 2012) and Mariza (Lisbon 2014). In the 2013 final at Wembley, the chorus was played twice. In the 2018 and 2019 finals, held in Kyiv and Madrid respectively, the instrumental version of the chorus was played, by 2Cellos (2018) and Asturia Girls (2019).[65][66] In the 2023 final, held in Istanbul, Hungarian pianist Ádám György performed the piano version of the anthem.[67] The anthem has been released commercially in its original version on iTunes and Spotify with the title of Champions League Theme. In 2018, composer Hans Zimmer remixed the anthem with rapper Vince Staples for EA Sports' video game FIFA 19, with it also featuring in the game's reveal trailer.[68] In 1991, UEFA asked its commercial partner, Television Event and Media Marketing (TEAM), to help brand the Champions League. This resulted in the anthem, \"house colours\" of black and white or silver and a logo, and the \"starball\". The starball was created by Design Bridge, a London-based firm selected by TEAM after a competition.[69] TEAM gives particular attention to detail in how the colours and starball are depicted at matches. According to TEAM, \"Irrespective of whether you are a spectator in Moscow or Milan, you will always see the same stadium dressing materials, the same opening ceremony featuring the 'starball' centre circle ceremony, and hear the same UEFA Champions League Anthem\". Based on research it conducted, TEAM concluded that by 1999, \"the starball logo had achieved a recognition rate of 94 percent among fans\".[70] The UEFA Champions League used to begin with a double round-robin group stage of 32 teams until it evolved into a league phase of 36 teams, which is preceded by two qualification 'streams' for teams that do not receive direct entry to the tournament proper. The two streams are divided between teams qualified by virtue of being league champions, and those qualified by virtue of finishing second, third or fourth in their national championship. The number of teams that each association enters into the UEFA Champions League is based upon the UEFA coefficients of the member associations. These coefficients are generated by the results of clubs representing each association during the previous five Champions League, Europa League and Conference League seasons. The higher an association's coefficient, the more teams represent the association in the Champions League, and the fewer qualification rounds the association's teams must compete in. Five of the remaining seven qualifying places are granted to the winners of a four-round qualifying tournament between the remaining 43 or 44 national champions, within which those champions from associations with higher coefficients receive byes to later rounds. The other two are granted to the winners of a three-round qualifying tournament between ten and eleven clubs from the associations ranked 5–6 through 15, which have qualified based upon finishing second, third or fourth in their respective national league. In addition to sporting criteria, any club must be licensed by its national association to participate in the Champions League. To obtain a license, the club must meet certain stadium, infrastructure and finance requirements. In 2005–06, Liverpool and Artmedia Bratislava became the first teams to reach the Champions League group stage after playing in all three qualifying rounds. Real Madrid and Barcelona hold the record for the most appearances in the group stage, having qualified 25 times, followed by Porto and Bayern Munich on 24.[71] Between 1999 and 2008, no differentiation was made between champions and non-champions in qualification. The 16 top-ranked teams spread across the biggest domestic leagues qualified directly for the tournament group stage. Prior to this, three preliminary knockout qualifying rounds whittled down the remaining teams, with teams starting in different rounds. An exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions League the year before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers.[72] UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that, if the Champions League winner fell outside of its domestic league's top four, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league. Until 2015–16, no association could have more than four entrants in the Champions League.[73] In May 2012, Tottenham Hotspur finished fourth in the 2011–12 Premier League, two places ahead of Chelsea, but failed to qualify for the 2012–13 Champions League, after Chelsea won the 2012 final.[74] Tottenham were demoted to the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League.[74] In May 2013,[75] it was decided that, starting from the 2015–16 season (and continuing at least for the three-year cycle until the 2017–18 season), the winners of the previous season's UEFA Europa League would qualify for the UEFA Champions League, entering at least the play-off round, and entering the group stage if the berth reserved for the Champions League title holders was not used. The previous limit of a maximum of four teams per association was increased to five, meaning that a fourth-placed team from one of the top three ranked associations would only have to be moved to the Europa League if both the Champions League and Europa League winners came from that association and both finished outside the top four of their domestic league.[76] In 2007, Michel Platini, the UEFA president, had proposed taking one place from the three leagues with four entrants and allocating it to that nation's cup winners. This proposal was rejected in a vote at a UEFA Strategy Council meeting.[77] In the same meeting, however, it was agreed that the third-placed team in the top three leagues would receive automatic qualification for the group stage, rather than entry into the third qualifying round, while the fourth-placed team would enter the play-off round for non-champions, guaranteeing an opponent from one of the top 15 leagues in Europe. This was part of Platini's plan to increase the number of teams qualifying directly into the group stage, while simultaneously increasing the number of teams from lower-ranked nations in the group stage.[78] In 2012, Arsène Wenger referred to qualifying for the Champions League by finishing in the top four places in the Premier League as the \"4th Place Trophy\". The phrase was coined after a pre-match conference when he was questioned about Arsenal's lack of a trophy after exiting the FA Cup. He said \"The first trophy is to finish in the top four\".[79] At Arsenal's 2012 AGM, Wenger was also quoted as saying: \"For me there are five trophies every season: Premier League, Champions League, the third is to qualify for the Champions League...\"[80] Beginning with the 2024–25 season, UEFA changed the format of their three club competitions, abandoning the group stage in favour of an expanded league phase.[81] The number of participating teams was increased from 32 to 36 teams. Teams are no longer divided into groups of four teams each but are ranked in a single table. Each team plays eight matches against eight different opponents. For the draw of the league phase, teams are divided into four seeding pots according to their UEFA coefficient. Each team will play against two teams from each pot, one home and one away. The league phase is played from September to January, while the knockout phase begins in February, with matches predominantly played on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. After the league phase, a two-legged knockout play-off round is played between teams finishing 9–16 (seeded) and 17–24 (unseeded) in the league phase. Teams finishing in the top eight of the league phase receive a bye to the round of 16 as seeded teams, while the eight winning teams from the knockout play-off round will enter the round of 16 draw as unseeded teams. Teams finishing 25th–36th place in the league phase and the eight losers of the knockout play-offs are eliminated from the competition and from European football since it is no longer possible to enter the Europa League from the league phase onwards. After the round of 16 the competition follows the traditional knockout format with quarter-finals, semi-finals (both two legged and without association draw protection) and then the final at a venue chosen prior to the season. The final is typically held in late May or early June. Prior to the 2024–25 season, the tournament proper began with a group stage of 32 teams, divided into eight groups of four.[82] The draw to determine which teams entered each group was seeded based on each team's UEFA coefficient, and no group could contain more than one club from each association. Each team played six group stage games, meeting the other three teams in its group home and away in a round-robin format.[82] The first place team and the runners-up from each group then progressed to the next round. The third-placed teams entered the Europa League's knockout round and the fourth-placed teams were eliminated from the competition. For the next stage – the last 16 – the winning team from one group played against the runners-up from another group, but teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other (see random two-sided matching). From the quarter-finals onwards, the draw was entirely random, without association protection.[83] The group stage was played from September to December, whilst the knockout stage began in February, with matches usually played on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. The knockout ties were played in a two-legged format, with the exception of the final. In the 2019–20 season, due to the COVID-19 pandemic the tournament was suspended for five months. The format of the remainder of the tournament was temporarily amended as a result, with the quarter-finals and semi-finals being played as single match knockout ties at neutral venues in Lisbon, Portugal in the summer with the final taking place on 23 August 2020.[84] The following is the default access list. Changes will be made to the access list above if the Champions League or Europa League title holders qualify for the tournament via their domestic leagues. Each year, the winning team is presented with the European Champion Clubs' Cup, the current version of which has been awarded since 1967. From the 1968–69 season and prior to the 2008–09 season any team that won the Champions League three years in a row or five times overall was awarded the official trophy permanently.[86] Each time a club achieved this, a new official trophy had to be forged for the following season.[87] Five clubs own a version of the official trophy: Real Madrid, Ajax, Bayern Munich, Milan and Liverpool.[86] Since 2008, the official trophy has remained with UEFA and the clubs are awarded a replica.[86] The current trophy is 74 cm (29 in) tall and made of silver, weighing 11 kg (24 lb). It was designed by Jürg Stadelmann, a jeweller from Bern, Switzerland, after the original was given to Real Madrid in 1966 in recognition of their six titles to date, and cost 10,000 Swiss francs. As of the 2012–13 season, 40 gold medals are presented to the Champions League winners, and 40 silver medals to the runners-up.[88] Starting with the 2024–25 season, the distribution of the prize money is as follows.[89] A large part of the distributed revenue from the UEFA Champions League is linked to the \"market pool\", the distribution of which is determined by the value of the television market in each nation. For the 2019–20 season, Paris Saint-Germain, who were the runners-up, earned nearly €126.8 million in total, of which €101.3 million was prize money, compared with the €125.46 million earned by Bayern Munich, who won the tournament and were awarded €112.96 million in prize money.[90] Like the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA Champions League is sponsored by a group of multinational corporations, in contrast to the single main sponsor typically found in national top-flight leagues. When the Champions League was created in 1992, it was decided that a maximum of eight companies should be allowed to sponsor the event, with each corporation being allocated four advertising boards around the perimeter of the pitch, as well as logo placement at pre- and post-match interviews and a certain number of tickets to each match. This, combined with a deal to ensure tournament sponsors were given priority on television advertisements during matches, ensured that each of the tournament's main sponsors was given maximum exposure.[91] From the 2012–13 knockout phase, UEFA used LED advertising hoardings installed in knockout participant stadiums, including the final. From the 2015–16 season onwards, UEFA has used such hoardings from the play-off round until the final.[92] Since 2021, the UEFA also used Virtual Board Replacement (VBR) technology to offer region-based advertising; regional sponsors are inserted into the hoardings as shown on the broadcast feed in specific regions along with the global sponsors.[93][94] Individual clubs may wear jerseys with advertising. However, only two sponsorships are permitted per jersey in addition to that of the kit manufacturer, at the chest and the left sleeve.[95] Exceptions are made for non-profit organisations, which can feature on the front of the shirt, incorporated with the main sponsor or in place of it; or on the back, either below the squad number or on the collar area.[96] If a club plays a match in a nation where the relevant sponsorship category is restricted (such as France's alcohol advertising restriction), then they must remove that logo from their jerseys. For example, when Rangers played French side Auxerre in the 1996–97 Champions League, they wore the logo of the holiday chain Center Parcs instead of their primary sponsor, McEwan's Lager (both companies at the time were subsidiaries of Scottish & Newcastle).[97] The tournament's main sponsors for the 2024–27 cycle are: Adidas is a secondary sponsor and supplies the official match ball, while Macron supplies the referee kits.[107] The competition attracts an extensive television audience, not just in Europe, but throughout the world. The final of the tournament has been, in recent years, the most-watched annual sporting event in the world.[108] The final of the 2012–13 tournament had the competition's highest TV ratings to date, drawing approximately 360 million television viewers.[109] Notes Players that are still active in Europe are highlighted in boldface. The table below does not include appearances made in the qualification stage of the competition. Starting from the 2021–22 edition, UEFA introduced the UEFA Champions League Player of the Season award. The jury is composed of the coaches of the clubs that participated in the group stage of the competition, as well as 55 journalists selected by the European Sports Media (ESM) group, one from each UEFA member association. In the same season, UEFA also introduced the UEFA Champions League Young Player of the Season award.",

He earned two number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100, with his features on the singles \"Slow Jamz\" by Twista alongside Kanye West, and \"Gold Digger\" by the former. His single \"Blame It\" won him the Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. Four of his five studio albums have charted in the top ten of the U.S. Billboard 200: Unpredictable (2005), which topped the chart, Intuition (2008), Best Night of My Life (2010), and Hollywood: A Story of a Dozen Roses (2015). Since 2017, Foxx has served as the host and executive producer of the Fox game show Beat Shazam. In 2021, he wrote his autobiography Act Like You Got Some Sense. Born in Terrell, Texas,[5] Foxx is the son of Darrell Bishop (renamed Shahid Abdula following his conversion to Islam),[6] who sometimes worked as a stockbroker, and Louise Annette Talley Dixon. Shortly after his birth, Foxx was adopted and raised by his mother's adoptive parents, Esther[7] Marie (née Nelson), a domestic worker and nursery operator, and Mark Talley, a yard worker.[8][9] He has had little contact with his birth parents, who were not part of his upbringing.[10] He was raised in the black quarter of Terrell, which at the time was a racially segregated community.[10] He has often acknowledged his grandmother's influence as one of the greatest reasons for his success.[8][11] Foxx began playing the piano when he was five years old.[12] He had a strict Baptist upbringing[8][13] and as a teenager was a part-time pianist and choir leader in Terrell's New Hope Baptist Church.[10] His natural talent for telling jokes was already in evidence as a third grader, when his teacher used him as a reward: if the class behaved well, Foxx would tell them jokes. He attended Terrell High School, where he received top grades and played basketball and football (as quarterback). His ambition was to play for the Dallas Cowboys, and he was the first player in the school's history to pass for more than 1,000 yards.[10][14] He also sang in a band called Leather and Lace.[10] After high school, Foxx received a scholarship to United States International University, where he studied musical and performing arts composition.[10][15] Foxx first told jokes at a comedy club's open mic night in 1989, after accepting a girlfriend's dare. When he found that female comedians were often called first to perform, he chose the stage name of Jamie Foxx, which he felt was ambiguous enough to disallow any biases,[10][16] with his surname being a tribute to the black comedian Redd Foxx.[16] Foxx joined the cast of In Living Color in 1991, where his recurrent character Wanda also shared a name with Redd's friend and co-worker, LaWanda Page. Following a recurring role in the comedy-drama sitcom Roc,[17] Foxx went on to star in his own sitcom The Jamie Foxx Show, from 1996 to 2001, which he also co-created and produced through his company Foxx Hole Productions and was aired on the WB network. Foxx made his film debut in the 1992 comedy Toys. His first dramatic role came in Oliver Stone's 1999 film Any Given Sunday, where he was cast as a hard-partying quarterback,[8] partly because of his own football background.[8] During filming, Foxx fought with costar LL Cool J.[18][19] In 2001, Foxx starred opposite Will Smith in Michael Mann's biographical drama Ali. Three years later, Foxx played taxi driver Max Durocher in the Mann film Collateral alongside Tom Cruise, for which he received outstanding reviews. Critic Roger Ebert praised Foxx's performance, stating that, \"Jamie Foxx's work is a revelation. I've thought of him in terms of comedy (\"Booty Call,\" \"Breakin' all the Rules\"), but here he steps into a dramatic lead and is always convincing and involving\".[20] He went on to receive a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance.[8] In 1994, Foxx released an album (on the Fox record label) entitled Peep This, which was not commercially successful. In 2003, Foxx made a cameo in Benzino's music video for \"Would You\", which features LisaRaye McCoy and Mario Winans. In 2003, Foxx featured on the rapper Twista's song, \"Slow Jamz\", together with Kanye West, which reached No. 1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and #3 on the UK Singles chart. His second collaboration with Kanye West, \"Gold Digger,\" in which Foxx sang the Ray Charles-influenced \"I Got a Woman\" hook, then went straight to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, remaining there for 10 weeks. In 2005, Foxx featured on the single \"Georgia\" by Atlanta rappers Ludacris and Field Mob, which sampled Ray Charles' hit \"Georgia on My Mind\". Foxx would also portray Ray Charles in the biographical film Ray (2004), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor[8] and the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Foxx is the third male in history (after Barry Fitzgerald and Al Pacino) to receive two acting Oscar nominations in the same year for two different movies, Collateral and Ray. In 2005, Foxx was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[21] Foxx released his second studio album, Unpredictable, in December 2005. It debuted at No. 2, selling 598,000 copies in its first week,[22] rising to No. 1 the following week and selling an additional 200,000 copies.[23] To date, the album has sold 1.98 million copies in the United States, and was certified double Platinum by the RIAA.[24][25] The album also charted on the UK Albums Chart, where it peaked at No. 9.[26] Foxx became the fourth artist to have both won an Academy Award for an acting role and to have achieved a No. 1 album in the U.S, joining Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby and Barbra Streisand. Foxx's first single from the album, the title track \"Unpredictable\" (featuring Ludacris), peaked in the Billboard Hot 100 Top 10 singles and also made the UK Top 20 singles chart; the track samples \"Wildflower\" by New Birth. The second U.S. single from the album was \"DJ Play a Love Song,\" which reunited Foxx with Twista. In the UK, the second single was \"Extravaganza\", which saw Foxx once again collaborate with Kanye West, although Foxx did not feature in the song's music video. At the 2006 BET Awards, Foxx won Best Duet/Collaboration with Kanye West for \"Gold Digger\" and tied with Mary J. Blige's \"Be Without You\" for Video of the Year. On December 8, 2006, Foxx received four Grammy Award nominations, which included Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for Love Changes featuring Mary J. Blige, Best R&B Album for Unpredictable, Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for Georgia by Ludacris & Field Mob featuring Jamie Foxx, and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for Unpredictable featuring Ludacris. Following on from these successes, Foxx went on to appear in the box-office hits Jarhead, Miami Vice, and Dreamgirls, which lifted his profile even higher as a bankable star in Hollywood. 2007 brought him the lead role in the action thriller film The Kingdom opposite Chris Cooper, Jason Bateman, Jennifer Garner and Ashraf Barhom. In September 2007, Foxx was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: \"[it was] one of the most amazing days of my life,\" said Foxx.[27] In April 2009, Foxx played the lead role in the dramatic film The Soloist. A few months later in October 2009, he played a starring role alongside Gerard Butler in the thriller Law Abiding Citizen. In 2007, his company FoxxKing Entertainment signed deals with MTV and VH1.[28] Foxx released his third album titled Intuition in 2008, featuring Kanye West, T.I., Ne-Yo, Lil' Kim and T-Pain. The album's first single, \"Just Like Me\" featuring T.I., was promoted by a video directed by Brett Ratner which featured an appearance by actress Taraji P. Henson. The second single \"Blame It\" featured T-Pain and became a top 5 single on the Billboard Hot 100 and a number-one single on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The song received many accolades for Foxx, including a Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards. The \"Blame It\" music video, directed by Hype Williams, features cameo appearances by Forest Whitaker, Samuel L. Jackson, Ron Howard, Quincy Jones and his Jarhead co-star Jake Gyllenhaal, amongst others. Foxx's musical career has also included a number of collaborations. In 2007, he recorded the song \"She Goes All the Way\" with country superstars Rascal Flatts for their Still Feels Good album. Foxx performed backing vocals for artist/songwriter Tank. He featured alongside The-Dream on Plies' \"Please Excuse My Hands.\" He also appeared alongside Fabolous on the remix of Ne-Yo's \"Miss Independent\". Foxx collaborated with rapper The Game on the track \"Around the World\". Foxx also featured on T.I.'s single \"Live in the Sky\" from the album King. On January 22, 2007, Foxx launched The Foxxhole, a channel on Sirius Satellite Radio featuring talk-radio programs, stand-up comedy albums and music primarily by African-American performers, as well as much of Foxx's own material. Foxx's own talk-radio variety program The Jamie Foxx Show airs Friday evenings on The Foxxhole with guests including musicians, actors and fellow comedians; co-hosts have included Johnny Mack, Speedy, Claudia Jordan, The Poetess, Lewis Dix, Yvette Wilson, T.D.P and Tyrin Turner. On the April 17, 2009, episode of The Jamie Foxx Show, Foxx and his co-hosts made several sexually suggestive and disparaging jokes regarding the teenage singer Miley Cyrus.[29] Several days later Foxx issued a public apology on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in response to growing public outcry and televised criticism by Cyrus's father, country singer Billy Ray Cyrus.[30] On April 6, 2009, Foxx, a longtime fan of country music, performed the George Strait song \"You Look So Good in Love\" at the George Strait Artist of the Decade All-Star Concert. Jamie Foxx hosted the 2009 BET Awards ceremony on June 28, 2009, which featured several tributes to pop star Michael Jackson, who had died three days prior to the show. As well as performing \"Blame It\" with T-Pain and \"She Got Her Own\" with Ne-Yo and Fabolous, Foxx opened the show with a rendition of Jackson's \"Beat It\" dance routine and closed the show with a cover of the Jackson 5's \"I'll Be There\" with Ne-Yo. \"We want to celebrate this black man. He belongs to us and we shared him with everybody else.\", said Foxx during the ceremony. In April 2011, Foxx voiced the cartoon canary Nico in the movie Rio. During the summer of 2011, Foxx was involved as a producer of In the Flow with Affion Crockett on Fox.[31] Foxx released his fourth album, Best Night of My Life, on December 21, 2010,[32] featuring the singles \"Winner\" (featuring Justin Timberlake and T.I.), \"Living Better Now\" (featuring rapper Rick Ross) and \"Fall for Your Type\" (featuring rapper Drake).[32] On October 7, the RCA Music Group announced that it was disbanding J Records along with Arista Records and Jive Records, meaning that all artists (including Foxx) previously signed to the three labels will release their future material on the RCA Records brand.[33][34] In 2011, Jamie Foxx also featured on the rapper Pitbull's album Planet Pit, in the song \"Where Do We Go\". In 2012, Foxx starred in the title role of the Quentin Tarantino written and directed Django Unchained.[35] Foxx starred alongside his Ray co-star Kerry Washington, as well as Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson. In an interview about Django Unchained, Foxx told Vibe magazine: \"As a black person it's always racial. ... when I get home my other homies are like how was your day? Well, I only had to be white for at least eight hours today, [or] I only had to be white for four hours.\"[36] The filming was emotional as Foxx said, \"It's tough shooting when you're in plantation row and that's where your ancestors were persecuted and killed.\"[37] On November 25, 2012, at BET's Soul Train Awards, Foxx joked: \"It's like church in here. First of all, giving honor to God and our lord and savior Barack Obama.\"[38] The joke led to condemnation from some Christians, to which Foxx responded: \"I'm a comic [and] sometimes I think people get a little too tight.\"[39] While hosting Saturday Night Live on December 8, 2012, to promote Django Unchained, Foxx joked about being excited \"to kill all the white people in the movie\".[40] Appearing at the 2013 NAACP Image Awards, Foxx praised the achievements of black people, saying that \"black people are the most talented people in the world\".[41] In 2013, Foxx was cast as President James Sawyer in White House Down alongside Channing Tatum.[42] The following year, Foxx appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 as the villain Electro, and co-starred with Quvenzhané Wallis in Annie, Sony's Will Smith and Jay-Z produced update of the comic strip-turned-musical.[43] In 2017, Foxx starred as Bats, a trigger-happy gang member, in Edgar Wright's action film Baby Driver. Foxx's October 2014 Deja Vu duet with Dionne Warwick appears on the Feels So Good album released by Warwick. He released his fifth studio album, Hollywood: A Story of a Dozen Roses, on May 18, 2015. It debuted atop the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts and at No. 10 on the Billboard 200.[44] In 2015, Foxx's voice was featured in the chorus on the Ariana Grande song, \"Focus\".[45] Since its debut in 2017, Foxx has been the host and executive producer of the Fox game show Beat Shazam, whose premise is similar to the once-popular game show format Name That Tune. On the show, three sets of two partners try to beat the software application Shazam in correctly identifying the titles of popular songs for increasingly higher amounts of money, with one team eventually vying for a potential prize of $1 million. Foxx's daughter Corinne began co-hosting the show in its second season in 2018, replacing DJ October Gonzalez.[46] The show has aired four seasons so far.[47] Foxx co-executive produced the 2017 Showtime sitcom White Famous, which starred Jay Pharoah as a young aspiring African-American comic, and was based on Foxx's own early career. Foxx also occasionally appeared on the show as himself. White Famous got middling reviews and ratings, and was cancelled after one season.[48] On May 22, 2019, Foxx appeared as George Jefferson in Live in Front of a Studio Audience: Norman Lear's All in the Family and The Jeffersons on ABC.[49] That year, he played wrongly convicted death row prisoner Walter McMillian in the drama film Just Mercy, for which he received significant critical acclaim.[50] Foxx starred in Project Power, directed by Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost, opposite Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Dominique Fishback, which was released on August 14, 2020, by Netflix.[51][52] That September, Foxx signed an overall deal with Sony Pictures Entertainment.[53] Foxx then voiced the main character, jazz pianist and music teacher Joe Gardner, in the Pixar animated film Soul (2020).[54] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Soul was released direct-to-streaming on Disney+ in most countries, including the United States,[55] though it did get a theatrical release in some countries.[56][57] USA Today's Brian Truitt commended Foxx's performance, saying he brought \"warmth, humor and an occasional touch of exasperation\" to the role.[58] Foxx co-created, executive produced and starred in the 2021 Netflix sitcom Dad Stop Embarrassing Me!, in which he played the single father of two teenage girls. The series marked Foxx's return to the sitcom format after The Jamie Foxx Show ended in 2001.[59] The entire eight-episode series premiered April 14, 2021, on Netflix. It was cancelled after one season.[60] He reprised his role as Electro in Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021), set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.[61] In 2021, Foxx released the memoir Act Like You Got Some Sense: And Other Things My Daughters Taught Me, which focused on his family life, both as a child and as an adult.[62] On May 29, 2018, Foxx was cast as Al Simmons in King Spawn, to be directed by Todd McFarlane.[63] In 2015, Foxx became attached to portray former boxer Mike Tyson in a biographical drama film Finding Mike; in 2020, he began to exercise in order to gain muscle for the role.[64] In 2021, the project turned into a miniseries, to be directed by Antoine Fuqua.[65] Foxx has two daughters: model, actress, and television producer Corinne Foxx, born in 1994;[10] and another daughter born in 2009.[66] Corinne made her formal debut at the Bal des débutantes in November 2014 and was named Miss Golden Globe 2016 on November 18, 2015.[67] In 2008, Foxx filmed a public service announcement for Do Something to promote food drives in local communities.[68] From 2013 to 2019, Foxx was rumored to be in a relationship with actress Katie Holmes.[69][70] On January 18, 2016, he rescued a young man from a burning vehicle that crashed outside his home. The driver, Brett Kyle, was driving his truck \"at a high rate of speed\" when it left the road, traveled into a drainage ditch, and rolled over several times. Kyle was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol.[71][72] On October 26, 2020, Foxx announced that his sister Deondra Dixon had died. She was 36 years old and had been born with Down syndrome. She had been an ambassador for the Global Down Syndrome Foundation.[73] On April 12, 2023, his daughter Corinne announced that he had been hospitalized after an unspecified medical emergency, but was recovering.[74][75] On May 12, amid conflicting reports about the nature of his condition, including rumors that he was gravely ill, Corinne said that her father had been \"out of the hospital for weeks, recuperating\".[76] He was reportedly treated in a \"physical rehab facility in Chicago\" that specializes in \"strokes and brain injuries\".[77] On July 22, Foxx posted a video clip commenting about his health, saying that he had been to \"hell and back\".[78][79][80] On December 3, 2023, he made his first public appearance since the hospitalization, to accept a Critics Choice Association's Vanguard Award. In his speech, he disclosed that he couldn't walk at first and discussed his recovery, without detailing exactly what led to his hospitalization.[81] Despite the news of his health challenges, he walked his daughter Corinne down the aisle in September 21, 2024 at his home in Thousand Oaks, California.[82][83] On December 10, 2024, Foxx revealed that he had a stroke that led to his hospitalization in April 2023 in his Netflix comedy special, Jamie Foxx: What Had Happened Was....[84] In April 2003, Foxx and his sister Deondra Dixon were confronted by security guards and had a physical struggle with police officers who arrested them at Harrah's casino in New Orleans.

He is rated as the number one player in the 2025 class after reclassifying from the 2026 class. Dybantsa grew up in Brockton, Massachusetts and initially attended Saint Sebastian's School. He has stated that his 8th grade religious studies teacher, Mr. Lewin, has been a mentor for him. [1] He was named the Massachusetts Boys' Basketball Gatorade Player of the Year following his freshman season after averaging 19.1 points, 9.6 rebounds, 2.9 assists and 2.5 blocks per game.[2] Dybantsa helped lead Saint Sebastian's to the NEPSAC Class A state championship, but lost to Milton Academy 77–76.[1] Dybantsa transferred to Prolific Prep in Napa, California at the end of his freshman year, where he teamed up with the second-ranked player in the 2026 class, Tyran Stokes.[2][3] In July 2023, Dybantsa led the Nike Peach Jam in scoring with 25.8 points per game[4] as a member of Expressions Elite, an Amateur Athletic Union team from Boston.[5] Dybantsa will conclude his high school basketball career playing at Utah Prep in Hurricane, Utah, where he transferred for the 2024-25 season.[6] Utah Prep was previously RSL Basketball Academy in Herriman.

On Tuesday, the biggest prospect in college basketball's 2025 recruiting class took to ESPN's \"First Take\" to announce where he'll be playing next season. AJ Dybantsa, the consensus top prospect in this year's senior class, announced his commitment to BYU. Dybantsa chose the Cougars over his other final three choices of Alabama, Kansas and North Carolina. Dybantsa is a native of Brockton, Mass. but is spending his senior season at Utah Prep in Hurricane, Utah. His college decision means he'll stay in the Beehive State, traveling 250 miles northeast to Provo, Utah. Here's more on Dybantsa's decision to attend BYU. MORE: Who lands where in SN's first 2025 NBA Mock Draft? Simply put, BYU's basketball program is entering a new era of excitement. Dybantsa's commitment adds to the momentum that's been building over the past year. It's been over a dozen years since Jimmer Fredette dazzled during his time with the Cougars but the program entered a new era in 2024 when it hired longtime NBA assistant coach Ryan Young to a lucrative contract. Shortly after adding Young, BYU signed Russian five-star recruit Egor Demin to be one of the program's featured players in 2024-25. The people believed to be behind it all are Jazz executives and BYU alums Ryan Smith and Danny Ainge, both of whom are doing their part to boost their alma mater in the new era of Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL). Smith is a co-founder of Qualtrics, the Jazz majority governor and is worth $2.2 billion, according to Forbes. With that in mind, Dybantsa's financial package is reportedly in the $7 million range. That BYU was willing — and able — to put together such a package speaks volumes about the caliber of player Dybantsa is. Choosing BYU is much more than a business decision, however. Dybantsa's athleticism and talent are through the roof and he now has a head coach with an NBA background. Under Young, Dybantsa can polish his game to be NBA-ready, as most expect him to head to the league after next season. \"A lot stood out on my visit … my ultimate goal is to get to the NBA,\" Dybantsa said on ESPN. \"[Young] coached one of my favorite players of all time — Kevin Durant. \"I think it's going to be the best development program for me.\" MORE COLLEGE BASKETBALL NEWS: Dybantsa is a 6-9, 210-pound small forward who has been in the spotlight for years. He was born on Jan. 29, 2007, and was originally a member of the 2026 recruiting class before reclassifying to graduate high school in 2025. As evidenced by his measurables, Dybantsa is a jumbo wing player. He pairs his size with elite strength and athleticism, allowing him to score at will. While still developing, Dybantsa's bag consists of a mixture of shifty moves that allow him to create space for jumpers or get past defenders to show off his bounce. After announcing his commitment, Dybantsa described his game as a blend of Tracy McGrady and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. Dybantsa's pro-ready body has called many to question whether or not he is ready for the NBA as a high school senior. He's no stranger to that level of competition, having already shared the floor to work out and play alongside future Hall of Famers Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, LeBron James and Chris Paul. Impressive as Dybantsa's game is, he will be tested when he takes the floor next season in the Big 12. BYU's conference foes include perennial power Kansas and the ever-physical Houston, among other strong squads. He'll continue to develop during his senior season at Utah Prep and quickly transition to the college game as soon as he steps foot on BYU's campus. He has the potential to take the squad even further than it went during Fredette's days. Gilbert McGregor first joined The Sporting News in 2018 as a content producer for Global editions of NBA.com. Before covering the game, McGregor played basketball collegiately at Wake Forest, graduating with a Communication degree in 2016. McGregor began covering the NBA during the 2017-18 season and has been on hand for a number of league events.",

The series consists of fifteen animated, standalone short stories based on the following video games and franchises:[1][2][3][4] Secret Level was created by Tim Miller, who executive produces at his company Blur Studio. Blur Studio serves as a production company along with Amazon MGM Studios. Dave Wilson serves as executive producer and supervising director. The series was ordered by Amazon Prime Video on August 14, 2024.[5] The series was announced during Gamescom on August 20, 2024. A trailer was released at the event, which featured segments from each of the episodes.[1][7] The pilot who features in the Armored Core episode was the subject of media attention and speculation due to his resemblance to actor Keanu Reeves.[8][9] Though Prime Video declined to disclose casting information at the time of the announcement, ComicBook.com reported an influx of \"nearly nothing but replies about Reeves and his potential appearance in [the series]\" under a post by Armored Core's social media account.[10] IGN's Wesley Yin-Poole said that were it not really Reeves, the actor could claim a royalty payment due to the certainty of the character's likeness to his.[11] GamesRadar+'s Ali Jones remarked that while the shot could have been \"simply be an ethnically ambiguous man with similar facial hair\", they noted the likeness, and doubted that Armored Core would place the image so prominently on their social media account if it were \"just some random actor\" and not Reeves.[12] In October 2024 Reeves's casting was officially revealed alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Kevin Hart, Heaven Hart, Gabriel Luna, Ariana Greenblatt, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Michael Beach, Emily Swallow, and Claudia Doumit.[6] The series premiered worldwide on December 10, 2024.[13] Half of the episodes were released for the premiere, and the other half releases on December 17, 2024.[6] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Secret Level has an approval rating of 67% based on 12 reviews, with an average rating of 6.0/10.[14] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 50 out of 100 based on 8 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[15]",

After weeks of Blind Auditions, Battles, Knockouts, Playoffs and live shows, the NBC singing competition named the Season 26 winner, who received $100,000, a recording contract and a shiny new trophy as part of the grand prize. Which Top 5 finalist came out on top after America cast its votes: Danny Joseph (Team Reba), Jeremy Beloate (Team Snoop), Shye (Team Bublé), Sydney Sterlace (Team Gwen) or Sofronio Vasquez (Team Bublé)? See for yourself — The Yodel is the go-to source for daily news, entertainment and feel-good stories. By signing up, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Policy. Find out how America voted… Fifth place: Jeremy Beloate (Team Snoop) Fourth place: Danny Joseph (Team Reba) Third place: Sydney Sterlace (Team Gwen) Though Sterlace came up short, Gwen Stefani praised the 16-year-old singer for making it this far in her young journey. “Every single moment counts. Being in the moment is what matters. Winning doesn’t matter. You’ve won,” Stefani said. Second place: Shye (Team Bublé) Right before the Voice winner was announced, Bublé promised that he and Shye would be working together in the future. “These are not the last words,” he said. “These are one of the many words that you and I are going to share going into a future together where I watch you make beautiful music.” And The Voice Season 26 champion is… Sofronio Vasquez (Team Bublé) Vasquez dropped to his knees once host Carson Daly named him the winner. Overcome with emotion, he cried tears of joy. Moments earlier, his coach, Michael Bublé, said the Filipino singer represented “the hope of so many people.” “Not just in the Philippines, but Asians everywhere truly are looking at you tonight. You have represented them so well. It has been an unbelievable journey,” Bublé said. It’s been an incredible run for Vasquez, who earned a four-chair turn in the Blind Auditions and has stuck with Bublé since day one, building an impressive catalog of performances throughout the season. His victory also earned Bublé his first win on his first try as a Voice coach. Every coach’s duet with the Top 5 The coaches took the stage to perform memorable duets with their finalists. Stefani and Sterlace kicked it off with their take on “Wild World” by Cat Stevens, followed by Snoop Dogg and Beloate, who performed “(Sittin’ on) The Dock of the Bay“ by Otis Redding. Bublé and Shye channeled Frank and Nancy Sinatra with their sweet cover of “Somethin’ Stupid,” before Reba McEntire and Joseph crooned “You Don’t Know Me“ by Cindy Walker. Lastly, Bublé partnered with Vasquez on the Motown classic “Who’s Lovin’ You” by the Miracles. Every star-studded performance The finale opened with the Top 8 (welcome back, Jan Dan, Adam Bohanan and Christina Eagle!) covering the musical hit “Defying Gravity” from Wicked. The episode was also filled with all-star performances from Dan + Shay, Myles Smith, Season 24 champion Huntley, Riley Green and Ella Langley, Snoop Dogg and Sting, Kelly Clarkson and Tears for Fears. Season 25 winner Asher HaVon closed out the night by performing a beautiful ballad written for and dedicated to McEntire, who was his coach. An early look at Season 27 The Voice takes a deserved two-month break before launching a new cycle in February. After leaving the program in 2019, original Voice coach Adam Levine will be back in the red chair for his anticipated return. The Maroon 5 frontman will be joined by returning coaches Bublé and John Legend, as well as Kelsea Ballerini, who makes her coaching debut. “It’s going to be electric,” Bublé teased. Until next season! The Voice returns for Season 27 on Feb. 3 at 8 p.m. ET on NBC.",

Sofronio Vasquez was crowned the champion during the Tuesday, December 10, finale. After Jeremy Beloate, Danny Joseph and Syndey Sterlace were revealed as the bottom three, Vasquez was announced as the winner with Shye coming in as runner up. Both of the final two finalists hailed from coach Michael Bublé’s team, marking his first win on the NBC series. “My Filipino brother, you are the hope of so many people. … It has been such an unbelievable journey to be here with you,” Bublé told Vasquez before host Carson Daly announced him as the winner. The live episode also featured performances by former coaches Kelly Clarkson and Dan + Shay as well as Snoop Dogg and Sting, Riley Green and Ella Langley, Tears for Fears, Myles Smith and more. Ahead of the two-night finale, the first part of which aired on Monday, December 9, the top five artists were announced, with each of the coaches — Reba McEntire, Snoop, Gwen Stefani and Bublé — seeing contestants from their team advance. Joseph represented Team Reba, Beloate competed on behalf of Team Snoop and Sterlace kept Team Gwen’s hopes alive. Meanwhile, Team Bublé had two members make it to the finale: Vasquez and Shye.

Stefani and McEntire both have one previous win under their belts, with Carter Rubin on season 19 in 2020 and Asher HaVon on season 25 in May, respectively.

                "title": "How Shai Gilgeous-Alexander dominated Luka Dončić to lead Thunder past Mavericks in NBA Cup quarterfinals - The Athletic",
                "content": "NBA Advertisement live Updated 56s ago The Oklahoma City Thunder booked their spot into the NBA Cup semifinals after eliminating the Dallas Mavericks on home soil. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led all scorers with 39 points. All five Thunder starters finished with double-digit points. Dallas struggled for consistency throughout the game. Naji Marshall and Klay Thompson were joint top-scorers with 19 points apiece. Luka Dončić had a triple-double in the loss (19 points, 11 rebounds, 10 assists), but only had two points entering the final quarter. With this result and Milwaukee's narrow win over Orlando last night, the home team is now 5-1 in six NBA Cup quarterfinal games. The lone win by the road team: New Orleans' 127-117 victory over Sacramento last season. Does it mean anything? It's way too early to tell. But it does support the general view that it's better to play elimination games at home than on the road. Advertisement The Dallas Mavericks struggled in tonight's NBA Cup quarterfinal loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder but, fortunately for them, have ample time to get back on track before their next game. Jason Kidd's squad have nine days until they return to action, hosting the LA Clippers in regular season on Dec. 19. It is the first of back-to-back home games with LA over a three-day span. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was interviewed postgame on TNT after his 39-point performance tonight, and in modern-day Thunder fashion, he was joined by his entire team. Gilgeous-Alexander was surrounded by his teammates, showing the continued unity within the group as they move to 19-5 on the season. The Thunder will face either the Golden State Warriors or Houston Rockets in Las Vegas on Saturday night. To back up what Mike said, SGA is the NBA's king of scoring in the 30s. Since the start of the 2022-23 season, SGA is fourth in points-per-game at 30.6, but no one can touch him in scoring outputs in the 30s. He has had 95 games where he scored between 30 and 39 points. Luka Dončić is second in that category but he has done it just 75 times. SGA is proving that you can still thrive in the 30s. With the score going final, the under (229.5) cashes, and the Thunder cover -4.5. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander hits his point total, while Luka Dončić and Kyrie Irving fall well short. Joshua Gateley / Getty Images Midway through the NBA Cup quarterfinals, the Thunder should be considered the slight favorite to win it all in Las Vegas next week. Of the six teams that remain, OKC, at 19-5, is having the best season. The Celtics and Cavaliers are already eliminated out East and the Thunder just dismantled a Mavericks team that entered as the hottest team in the NBA, snapping their seven-game win streak. It won't be a simple path for the Thunder. They will face the winner of Wednesday night's game between the Warriors and Rockets, a pair of teams that delivered OKC two of their five losses this season. The Rockets have a stronger wave of athletic defenders to throw at Gilgeous-Alexander and the Warriors employ Steph Curry, who has a delivered a handful of heartbreaking shots to the Thunder franchise in his storied career. Advertisement The Thunder outscored the Mavericks 36-17 off turnovers tonight in Oklahoma City. The only other time the Mavericks allowed at least 36 points off turnovers in the Luka Dončić era (since 2018-19) was Dec. 31, 2018, when they were outscored 36-5 off turnovers ... at Oklahoma City. Alonzo Adams / Imagn The Thunder end up taking 50 3s, which is the third-most in franchise history in a game that didn't go to overtime. They hit five more 3s than the Mavericks. They committed three fewer turnovers. They had 10 more offensive rebounds. That's how you win a game in which the other team has 12 more free throws and gets more shots near the rim. That, and OKC had the best player on the court even when Luka Dončić was there too. On to Las Vegas for the Thunder. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander appears on track to finish with 39 points, meaning he won't eclipse 40 for just the 15th time in his career. He always seems to score just enough points to get the job done — no more, no less. I'm watching OKC and I just don't understand how these jerseys fits into the Thunder color palette. Are there a lot of Orange Julius store in Oklahoma City? (Yes, I know the official color of those jerseys is Sunset. Is OKC known for its sunsets?) Just when you think the Mavericks have what it takes to catch the Thunder, Oklahoma City kickstarts another offensive surge. The hosts have a 15-point lead with less than four minutes to play. Advertisement The Thunder won't need Alex Caruso every night with the depth they have, but they'll need him for the big nights. And those last two plays — a drive-and-kick assist for a 3, a steal on a Naji Marshall drive — are why the Thunder brought him to town. After the Mavs narrowed the lead to eight, Oklahoma City had a nice Thunderclapback. They're up 15 now, and rolling following a 7-0 run. They've taken hold of the game and have to weather 5:58 more before they're on their way to Las Vegas. Nothing like a good \"Ref you suck\" chant during a game to remind you that professional sports haven't been completely lost to the sportsbooks and broadcast networks. Sure sounded like a pretty loud one in OKC just now. The Mavericks have outscored the Thunder by 10 points in the 9:14 that Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has sat, as of 8:55 left in the fourth quarter. Bleeding points. But it's nice when the adjustment is to summon Gilgeous-Alexander to the scorers table. Joshua Gateley / Getty Images This might turn out to be historic night for the Thunder. They've taken 44 3s already. They've only topped that amount 31 times in their franchise history. The team record for 3s in a game is 63, but that was in a double overtime game. The non-OT record is 54 in 2019. We'll see if OKC gets there tonight. Advertisement Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has 34 points through three quarters in this game. As our Marcus Thompson pointed out in a recent piece, SGA is the NBA equivalent of a metronome. For as great a scorer as he is, SGA has only topped 40 points 14 times in his career. He always seems to score just as many points as he needs to score, seemingly every game. This game might be too lopsided for SGA to get his career high. If so, he'll have done his job already without needing to add any extra on top. Through three quarters in Oklahoma City: Dallas Mavericks starting lineup that includes Luka Dončić and Kyrie Irving: 37 points on 39 shots Shai Gilgeous-Alexander: 34 points on 20 shots P.J. Washington (out with an illness) probably shouldn't be this important to the Mavericks. But considering the postseason series Washington had last year against the Thunder, his 27-point, 17-rebound performance at Oklahoma City last month and the fact that Dallas is 1-4 without Washington this season, his absence has been glaring.",

                "content": "Tears for Fears are an English pop rock band formed in Bath in 1981 by Curt Smith and Roland Orzabal. Founded after the dissolution of their first band, the mod-influenced Graduate, Tears for Fears were associated with the synth-pop bands of the 1980s, and attained international chart success as part of the Second British Invasion.[8] The band's debut album, The Hurting (1983), reached number one on the UK Albums Chart, and their first three hit singles – \"Mad World\", \"Change\", and \"Pale Shelter\" – all reached the top five in the UK Singles Chart. Their second album, Songs from the Big Chair (1985), reached number one on the US Billboard 200, achieving multi-platinum status in both the US and the UK.[9][10] The album contained two US Billboard Hot 100 number one hits: \"Shout\" and \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\", both of which also reached the top five in the UK with the latter winning the Brit Award for Best British Single in 1986.[11] Their belated follow-up, The Seeds of Love (1989), entered the UK chart at number one and yielded the transatlantic top 5 hit \"Sowing the Seeds of Love\". After touring The Seeds of Love in 1990, Orzabal and Smith had an acrimonious split. Orzabal retained the Tears for Fears name as a solo project, releasing the albums Elemental (1993) – which produced the international hit \"Break It Down Again\" – and Raoul and the Kings of Spain (1995). Orzabal and Smith reconciled in 2000 and released an album of new material, Everybody Loves a Happy Ending, in 2004. The duo have toured on a semi-regular basis since then. After being in development for almost a decade, the band's seventh album, The Tipping Point, was released in 2022,[12] giving the band their sixth UK Top 5 album and their highest chart peak in 30 years, and reaching the Top 10 in numerous other countries, including the US. In 2021, Orzabal and Smith were honoured with the Ivor Novello Award for 'Outstanding Song Collection' recognising their \"era-defining Tears for Fears albums\" and \"critically acclaimed, innovative hit singles\".[13] Orzabal and Smith met as teenagers in Bath, Somerset, England. Their professional debut came with the band Graduate, a mod revival/new wave act whose influences included the Jam and two-tone music.[14] In 1980, Graduate released an album, Acting My Age, and a single \"Elvis Should Play Ska\" (referring to Elvis Costello). The single just missed the top 100 in the UK, but performed well in Spain and in Switzerland. The band split in 1981. Shortly afterwards, Orzabal and Smith became session musicians for the band Neon,[15] where they first met future Tears for Fears drummer Manny Elias. Neon also featured Pete Byrne and Rob Fisher, who went on to become Naked Eyes.[16] The pair continued working together, drawing inspiration from artists such as Talking Heads, Peter Gabriel and Brian Eno.[17][18] Orzabal and Smith were impressed by the synth-pop sound of Gary Numan's \"Are 'Friends' Electric?\" (1979), aspiring to make such music themselves. Their new electronic direction was assured upon hearing the work of bands like Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD), Depeche Mode and the Human League.[14][19] Post-punk band Joy Division were also influential, inspiring Orzabal to write more introspective and personal songs.[17][19] The likes of OMD and Soft Cell had popularised the \"duo\" presentation within the synth-pop scene, inspiring Orzabal and Smith to package themselves as a two-man unit, initially under the name History of Headaches.[20][21] The name Tears for Fears was inspired by primal therapy, developed by the American psychologist Arthur Janov, which gained tremendous publicity after John Lennon became Janov's patient in 1970.[22] When Orzabal and Smith finally met Janov in the mid-1980s, they were disillusioned to find he had become quite \"Hollywood\" and wanted the band to write a musical for him.[23] As Tears for Fears, Orzabal and Smith intended to form the nucleus of the group and bring in surrounding musicians to help them complete the picture. Around this time they met local musician Ian Stanley, who offered them free use of his home 8-track studio. Stanley began working with the duo as their keyboard-player and, after recording two demos, Tears for Fears were signed to Mercury Records in the UK in 1981 by A&R manager Dave Bates. Their first single, \"Suffer the Children\", produced by David Lord, was released on that label in November 1981, followed by the first edition of \"Pale Shelter\" (produced by Mike Howlett) in March 1982, but neither release was successful. The band achieved their first taste of success with their third single, \"Mad World\", which reached No. 3 in the UK in November 1982.[24] Their first album, The Hurting, was released in March 1983. The album, produced by Chris Hughes and Ross Cullum, showcased guitar- and synthesizer-based songs with lyrics reflecting Orzabal's bitter childhood and his interest in primal therapy.[17] The album was a big success and had a lengthy chart run (65 weeks) in the UK, where it reached No. 1 and platinum status. It also reached the top 20 in several other countries and yielded the international hit singles \"Mad World\" (top 5 hit in South Africa), \"Change\" (top 40 hit in Australia, Canada, Ireland, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and South Africa – their first single to reach the US Billboard Hot 100), and a re-recorded version of \"Pale Shelter\". All three of these singles reached the Top 5 in the UK. Towards the end of 1983, the band released a new, slightly more experimental single, \"The Way You Are\", intended as a stopgap while they worked on their second album. The single was a top-30 hit in the UK, but did not come close to matching the success of their three previous hits, despite a national concert tour in December of that year (captured on the In My Mind's Eye live video release). The single, which heavily featured sampling and programmed rhythms, was a departure from Tears for Fears' previous musical approach. In the liner notes to their 1996 B-sides compilation album Saturnine Martial & Lunatic they wrote \"this was the point we realised we had to change direction\", though the somewhat experimental style of the single continued to be reflected in their forthcoming B-sides. In early 1984, they began working with a new producer, Jeremy Green, on their new single \"Mothers Talk\". However, the band were ultimately unhappy with the results and so producer Chris Hughes was brought back into the fold and the \"Mothers Talk\" single re-produced for release in August 1984. A departure from their earlier works, the single became a top-20 hit in the UK, but it was the follow-up single \"Shout\" (released in the UK in November 1984) that was the real beginning of the band's international fame. \"Shout\", a top-5 UK hit, paved the way for their second album, Songs from the Big Chair (released in February 1985), which entered the UK album chart at No. 2 and remained in the upper reaches of the chart for the next 12 months. They did away with the predominantly synthpop feel of the first album, instead expanding into a more sophisticated sound that would become the band's stylistic hallmark. Anchored on the creative hub of Orzabal, Stanley and producer Hughes, the new Tears for Fears sound helped to propel Songs from the Big Chair into becoming one of the year's biggest sellers worldwide, eventually being certified triple platinum in the UK and quintuple platinum in the US (where it remained the No. 1 album for five weeks in the summer of 1985).[25] The album's title was inspired by the book and television miniseries Sybil, the chronicle of a woman with dissociative identity disorder who sought refuge in her analyst's \"big chair\", Orzabal and Smith stating they felt each of the album's songs had a distinctive personality of its own. The band had also recorded a track titled \"The Big Chair\", which was released as the B-side to \"Shout\" but was not included on the album. The album's success came in conjunction with the array of hit singles it yielded: \"Mothers Talk\" (re-recorded yet again for its US release in 1986), \"Shout\" (No. 4 UK, No. 1 in the US, Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and a huge hit in other territories), \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" (their highest-charting UK and Irish hit at No. 2 and another No. 1 in the US and in Canada), \"Head over Heels\" (UK No. 12, US No. 3, Ireland No. 5, Canada No. 8), and \"I Believe (A Soulful Re-Recording)\" (UK No. 23 and Ireland No. 10).[26] Some regions even saw the release of limited edition 10\" singles for these hits, and a variety of double packs and picture discs in addition to the regular 7\" and 12\" formats. Following the album's release, the band went on a world tour that lasted most of the year, playing notably at the Montreux Golden Rose Rock and Pop Festival in May 1985.[27] In September 1985, the band performed \"Shout\" at the 1985 MTV Video Music Awards at the Radio City Music Hall in New York.[28] Also during the tour, Orzabal and Smith discovered an American female singer/pianist, Oleta Adams, who was performing in a Kansas City hotel bar, and whom they invited to collaborate on their next album. Towards the end of the year, they released a video collection/documentary titled Scenes from the Big Chair. In February 1986, having completed the lengthy and exhausting Big Chair world tour, Tears for Fears were honoured at the 1986 Brit Awards in London, where they won the Best British Single award for \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\".[29] The band was also nominated for Best British Group and Best British Album, and Chris Hughes was nominated for Best Producer.[29] Tears for Fears performed the song at the ceremony, which became the final public performance of drummer Manny Elias who left the group shortly afterwards. At the same time, the band was nominated for Favorite Pop/Rock Duo/Group and Favorite Pop/Rock Duo/Group Video Artist at the 1986 American Music Awards in Los Angeles;[30] performing \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" during the TV show.[31] And in April, a remixed version of \"Mothers Talk\" was released in North America, reaching the US Top 30.[32] The same year, Orzabal and Stanley worked together on a side project named Mancrab and released a single, \"Fish for Life\", which was written for the soundtrack of the film The Karate Kid, Part II. The track was written and produced by Orzabal and Stanley, and featured vocals by US singer/dancer Eddie Thomas, who was one of the dancers in the video for \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\". On 13 July 1985, Tears for Fears were scheduled to perform at JFK Stadium in Philadelphia for the Live Aid charity event. However, on the morning of the event, it was announced that the band (who had actually been billed to appear before they had even agreed to do so) had pulled out of the show. They were replaced by blues rock group George Thorogood and the Destroyers, which had a strong Philadelphia-area following. The official reason given for their non-appearance was that two of their backing musicians, guitarist Andrew Sanders and saxophonist Will Gregory, had quit due to the expiration of their contract; they were replaced by Alan Griffiths on guitar and Josephine Wells on saxophone for the remaining bulk of the 1985 world tour. In place of appearing, the band pledged to donate proceeds from their concerts played in Tokyo, Sydney, London and New York.[33] As a further donation, the band also recorded a slightly rewritten version of one of their biggest hits and released it for the British fundraising initiative Sport Aid in 1986, a sister project of Band Aid in which people took part in running races of varying length and seriousness to raise more money for African famine relief projects. Sport Aid's slogan was \"I Ran the World\", therefore Tears for Fears released \"Everybody Wants to Run the World\" (No. 5 in the UK and No. 4 in Ireland). Indirectly, the band were involved in the earlier Band Aid single \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" from 1984, which featured a slowed down sample from their song \"The Hurting\" (from their debut album of the same name) in the introduction. It was 1989 before the group released their third album, The Seeds of Love (on which Ian Stanley appeared for the last time as a member of Tears for Fears), at a reported production cost of over a million pounds.[34][35] With Stanley and Chris Hughes having both left the project and the band early during the recording sessions due to creative differences, the album was written largely by Orzabal along with keyboardist Nicky Holland (who had toured with Tears for Fears on their \"Big Chair\" world tour in 1985). Moving from various studios and using various sets of producers over many months, the band ultimately decided to scrap the recordings and take the reins themselves with assistance from engineer Dave Bascombe. Much of the material was recorded in jam sessions and later edited down. The length of the production impacted on the band's management company, who had financially over-extended themselves in other business matters and were hoping for an earlier release date to pay off their debts.[36][37] The album retained the band's epic sound while showing increasing influences ranging from jazz and blues to the Beatles, the latter being evident on the hit single \"Sowing the Seeds of Love\".[38] The second single from the album was \"Woman in Chains\" (a top 40 hit in the UK, Canada, France, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden and the US), on which Phil Collins played drums and Oleta Adams—whom Orzabal would later guide to a successful solo career—shared vocals. The album was a worldwide success, entering the UK Albums Chart at no. 1, making the top 10 in the US and in numerous other countries, eventually going on to sell millions of copies internationally. The band set out on an extensive \"Seeds of Love\" world tour sponsored by Philips to start recovering the debt incurred during the recording process. The band's show in Santa Barbara, California, in May 1990 would be captured on the Going to California live video as the singles \"Advice for the Young at Heart\" and \"Famous Last Words\" delivered modest chart success.[39] A 64-page companion book, simply titled Tears for Fears – The Seeds of Love, was released by Virgin Books in 1990 and offered extensive insight from Orzabal, Holland and Adams into the songwriting and production process for the album, as well as the musical scores for each track and rare promotional photographs from the era. After The Seeds of Love, Orzabal and Smith had an acrimonious falling out and parted company in 1991. The split was blamed on Orzabal's perfectionist approach to production and delays caused by Smith's jetsetting lifestyle and desire to slow down the pace of their work (Smith was also going through a divorce at the time).[40] Another factor in the break-up was the band's manager, Paul King, who declared bankruptcy in 1990 and was later convicted of fraud in 2004.[36][41] Following Smith's departure, Orzabal kept the band name alive by releasing the 1992 hit single \"Laid So Low (Tears Roll Down)\". The single was released to promote the band's greatest hits collection Tears Roll Down (Greatest Hits 82–92), which featured every single to reach the Top 20, either in the UK or internationally, apart from the Sport Aid fundraiser. The album peaked at no. 2 in the UK, where it was certified double platinum, and also reached the Top 10 in several other countries, including France, Italy and New Zealand.[42] In 1993, Orzabal (still under the name Tears for Fears) released the album Elemental together with longtime collaborator Alan Griffiths. Co-produced by Tim Palmer, it yielded the international hit \"Break It Down Again\" (top 20 in the UK, Canada, France, and Italy) and was supported with another successful world tour, including a college tour of the US where \"Break It Down Again\" reached no. 25. Although it charted considerably lower in the US than the previous two studio albums (no. 45), it still earned a Gold disc there for sales of over half a million copies. Orzabal, still working with Griffiths and Palmer, released another Tears for Fears album, Raoul and the Kings of Spain, in 1995. This album was a more contemplative work that delved into his own Spanish heritage and showcased a new Latin musical influence (Raoul was originally the name Orzabal's parents wanted to give him, and is also the name of his own first son). The album was not a commercial success by Tears for Fears standards, though minor chart success came via the single release of the title track (top 40 in the UK) and (to a lesser extent) the single \"God's Mistake\". In 1996 a B-sides compilation album, Saturnine Martial & Lunatic, was released on Mercury, which included B-sides and some rare tracks from the successful 1982–93 period. Around 2000, the duo began talking again after Orzabal helped with paperwork regarding property of Smith's.[43] Smith flew back to England (where Orzabal still lived) and they had dinner and decided to work on a new album together.[44][45][46] The songwriting sessions included Charlton Pettus (Smith's collaborator since the mid-1990s), and 14 songs were written and recorded in less than six months. After initially being signed to Arista Records by L.A. Reid in 2003, record company mergers and the departure of Reid led to the band opting to terminate the contract. The ensuing album, Everybody Loves a Happy Ending, was eventually released in September 2004 on New Door Records in the U.S. Two U.S. tours followed, and the 2004 tour included an unrehearsed guest appearance by Oleta Adams at the Kansas City show for a performance of \"Woman in Chains\". Everybody Loves a Happy Ending was released in the UK and Europe in March 2005 on Gut Records, shortly after the comeback single \"Closest Thing to Heaven\" became the first Tears for Fears UK Top 40 hit in a decade. The promo video for the single was a colourful fantasy that featured Hollywood actress Brittany Murphy riding in a hot air balloon. The European releases of the album contained all fourteen tracks recorded during the recording sessions, while the US version only contained twelve. A brief tour of larger UK venues followed in April. A live performance at the Parc des Princes stadium in Paris, recorded in June 2005, was released on CD and DVD in France and Benelux. Titled Secret World – Live in Paris, it was released on the XIII Bis label in early 2006 and became a best-seller, with over 70,000 physical copies sold in addition to downloads. The CD contained a new studio song, \"Floating Down the River\", and a remastered Curt Smith/Mayfield track, \"What Are We Fighting For?\". During this period, \"Mad World\" was re-recorded by Michael Andrews and Gary Jules for the soundtrack of the 2001's film Donnie Darko; a 2003 single release of the song reached number one in the UK for three consecutive weeks[47] and won Orzabal his second Ivor Novello Award.[48] This version also reached the Top 40 in numerous other countries between 2003 and 2013.[49] In 2006, Songs from the Big Chair was re-issued again by Universal Music. It included the rare piano version of \"The Working Hour\", which had previously only been available as a limited edition item. In August 2009, the Raoul and the Kings of Spain album was also re-issued by Cherry Red Records, featuring seven bonus B-side tracks from the time of its original release.[50][better source needed] In April 2010, Tears for Fears joined the reformed 1980s group Spandau Ballet on their seven-date tour of Australia and New Zealand, before a four-date headlining tour of their own in Southeast Asia (Philippines, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan) and a 17-date tour of the United States.[51][52] In 2011 and 2012, they played dates in the US, Japan, South Korea, Manila and South America.[53] In May 2013, Smith confirmed that he was writing and recording new Tears for Fears material with Orzabal and Charlton Pettus.[54] In August 2013, Tears for Fears released their first newly recorded material in nearly a decade, with a cover of Arcade Fire's \"Ready to Start\" made available on SoundCloud.[55] In 2014, the track was included on a limited edition 3-track 10\" vinyl EP from the band called Ready Boy & Girls?, released exclusively for Record Store Day, which also featured covers of Hot Chip's \"Boy from School\" and Animal Collective's \"My Girls\". All three songs were recorded as \"kick-start\" projects as the band commenced work on their seventh studio album. In an interview on BBC Radio Devon in October 2014, Orzabal stated that the band had now signed to Warner Music Group and that around five or six songs had so far been completed for the new album.[56][57] To commemorate the 30th anniversary of the band's debut album The Hurting, Universal Music reissued it in October 2013 in two deluxe editions. Deluxe editions of the band's second album, Songs from the Big Chair, were released on 10 November 2014. On 12 November 2014, Tears for Fears performed \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" on ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live! TV programme.[2] In mid 2015, the band began a series of live dates in the United States and Canada.[3][58] In July 2016, the band played their first live dates in the UK in over ten years: the Newmarket Nights festival at Newmarket Racecourse on 29 July[59] and a closing night headlining appearance at Camp Bestival at Lulworth Castle in Dorset on 31 July. The gigs marked the band's first UK festival appearances since Knebworth in 1990.[60] The band again toured the United States and Canada in September and October 2016.[61] In 2017, the band toured North America with co-headliners Hall & Oates,[62] and also played in Israel, at the British Summer Time Festival in London's Hyde Park on 8 July, and at the Rock in Rio festival in Brazil on 22 September.[63] In a July 2017 interview, Orzabal stated that the band had collaborated with songwriter/producer Sacha Skarbek on their seventh album, The Tipping Point, and divulged several song titles from it including \"My Demons\", \"I Love You but I'm Lost\", \"End of Night\" and \"Up Above the World\".[64] In an interview with SiriusXM Canada the same month, Orzabal divulged that although the band had signed with Warner Music to release their new album (which had been scheduled for October 2017), Universal Music had then approached Warner Music about buying the rights to the album so that they could release it (Universal being the rights holders of the vast majority of the band's back catalogue).[65] Roland Orzabal's wife, Caroline, died in the summer of 2017.[66] Tears for Fears initially withdrew from the remaining shows on their pending North American tour, but they resumed the tour in September 2017 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.[67] During his late wife's illness, Orzabal began writing songs that appear on the 2022 Tears for Fears album, The Tipping Point.[68] On 26 October 2017, the band performed a 65-minute live set at the BBC Radio Theatre in London for the Radio 2 in Concert series, which was broadcast on both radio and television (via the BBC Red Button service). The following night, the band played their first full-length UK concert since 2005, at London's Royal Albert Hall. Prior to this, on 12 October, \"I Love You but I'm Lost\" was released as a single from a new 16-track Tears For Fears compilation album titled Rule the World: The Greatest Hits. In October 2017, the band announced an 11-date UK arena tour for April–May 2018, featuring Alison Moyet as the support act. However, the tour was postponed to early 2019 due to Orzabal's health problems following the death of his wife.[69] The band performed at further UK and European festivals in the summer of 2019, starting with the Hampton Court Palace Festival on 18 and 19 June, the Forest Live festival at Delamere Forest on 21 June,[70] and the Nocturne Live Concert Series at Blenheim Palace on 22 June.[71][72] In February 2020, Songs from the Big Chair was the subject of an episode of the BBC series Classic Albums featuring new interviews with the band and all key personnel from the album's creation and subsequent success.[73] To coincide with the album's 35th anniversary, the 2014 deluxe boxed set was reissued by Universal Music, as well as a new 12-inch vinyl picture disc of the album. In October 2020, The Seeds of Love album was reissued as various deluxe editions and returned the band to the UK Top 20.[74] In November 2020, after a change in management, Everybody Loves a Happy Ending was made available through various streaming services for the first time.[75] On 12 June 2021, Tears for Fears released the live double album Live at Massey Hall (recorded in 1985) for Record Store Day[76] and in September, Orzabal and Smith were honoured at the Ivor Novello Awards.[77] On 7 October 2021, Smith appeared on the BBC Radio 2 programme The Zoe Ball Breakfast Show to introduce the band's single \"The Tipping Point\", the first track from their seventh album, The Tipping Point, released on Concord Records on 25 February 2022.[78][79] In November 2021, Tears for Fears announced a summer tour of the US and UK to commence in May 2022.[80][81] The band had to cancel the tour before its completion, due to Smith suffering four broken ribs in a road accident in July 2022.[82] Two further singles, \"No Small Thing\"[83] and \"Break the Man\",[84] were released before the album (respectively in early December 2021 and mid-January 2022). The Tipping Point received largely positive reviews from critics[85] and entered the UK Charts at number 2 while topping the UK Album Sales Chart, the UK Physical Albums Sales Chart, the UK Downloads Albums Chart, the UK Vinyl Albums Chart, and also the Scottish regional album chart.[86] It also reached the Top 10 in numerous other countries[87] (entering the US Billboard 200 at number 8) and topped the US Billboard's Top Alternative Albums, Top Rock Albums and Top Album Sales charts.[88] On 1 June 2022, a video was released for the song \"My Demons\" (the fourth single from The Tipping Point),[89] and while the band was on tour, \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" re-entered the UK Singles Chart[90] and entered the Billboard Global 200.[91] In April 2023, Tears for Fears announced the second part of the Tipping Point World Tour.[92] In June 2023, \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" returned to the UK Singles Chart once again for an additional 22 week chart run, reaching its peak position at number 72 in September.[90] On 12 September 2024, Tears for Fears announced the release of the Songs for a Nervous Planet album, featuring eighteen live tracks, recorded on 11 July 2023 in Franklin, Tennessee, during the band's Tipping Point World Tour, as well as four (or five in some limited editions)[93][94] new studio tracks.[95][96] The cover art, described as \"mixed media digital collage with AI being just one of the many tools used in the creative process\", was criticized by fans.[97] Tears for Fears described the cover art as \"a vibrant artwork that evoked a sense of sci-fi, futuristic themes, and an escape from what is known\".[98] Two of the new tracks were released as singles from the album before its issue: \"The Girl That I Call Home\" on 12 September and \"Astronaut\" on 4 October 2024. Songs for a Nervous Planet entered the Top 10 in the UK[99] (becoming the band's seventh UK top 10 album)[100] and the Top 40 in several other countries.[101] Current members Former members with with with Roland Orzabal with with with",

                "content": "The English new wave/pop rock band Tears for Fears have released seven studio albums, along with numerous singles, compilations and videos. Formed in 1981 by Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith, the duo signed to Phonogram Records in the UK and released their first single the same year. It was not until Tears for Fears' third single, \"Mad World\" (1982), that they scored their first hit, and their platinum-selling debut album The Hurting (1983) was a UK number one. Their second album, Songs from the Big Chair, was released in 1985 and became a worldwide hit, establishing the band in the US. After a third platinum-selling studio album, The Seeds of Love (1989), Smith and Orzabal parted company. The band's first greatest hits album was released in 1992 and went double platinum in the UK. Subsequent Tears for Fears studio albums Elemental (1993) and Raoul and the Kings of Spain (1995) were effectively solo albums by Orzabal. However, the duo reformed in 2000 for a new studio album, Everybody Loves a Happy Ending, which was released in 2004/05. Although continuing to tour regularly across the world, the band's recording output slowed down for several years. A new compilation album, Rule the World: The Greatest Hits, was released in 2017, giving the band their sixth UK Top 20 album. After a lengthy development, the band's seventh studio album, The Tipping Point, was released in February 2022.

Tags: The Federal Trade Commission today sued to block the largest proposed supermarket merger in U.S. history—Kroger Company’s $24.6 billion acquisition of the Albertsons Companies, Inc.—alleging that the deal is anticompetitive. The FTC charges that the proposed deal will eliminate fierce competition between Kroger and Albertsons, leading to higher prices for groceries and other essential household items for millions of Americans. The loss of competition will also lead to lower quality products and services, while also narrowing consumers’ choices for where to shop for groceries. For thousands of grocery store workers, Kroger’s proposed acquisition of Albertsons would immediately erase aggressive competition for workers, threatening the ability of employees to secure higher wages, better benefits, and improved working conditions. “This supermarket mega merger comes as American consumers have seen the cost of groceries rise steadily over the past few years. Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons would lead to additional grocery price hikes for everyday goods, further exacerbating the financial strain consumers across the country face today,” said Henry Liu, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition. “Essential grocery store workers would also suffer under this deal, facing the threat of their wages dwindling, benefits diminishing, and their working conditions deteriorating.” The FTC issued an administrative complaint and authorized a lawsuit in federal court to block the proposed acquisition pending the Commission’s administrative proceedings. A bipartisan group of nine attorneys general is joining the FTC’s federal court complaint. Kroger operates thousands of stores across 36 states, which includes regional banners such as Fred Meyer, Fry’s, Harris Teeter, King Soopers, Kroger, and Quality Food Centers (QFC). Albertsons also operates thousands of stores across 35 states under regional names including Albertsons, Haggen, Jewel-Osco, Pavilions, Safeway, and Vons. If the merger were completed, Kroger and Albertsons would operate more than 5,000 stores and approximately 4,000 retail pharmacies and would employ nearly 700,000 employees across 48 states. Executives for both Kroger and Albertsons have acknowledged that the two supermarkets are direct competitors, forcing each other to aggressively compete for customers by lowering prices and for employees by providing better pay and benefits across the country. Similarly, executives for both supermarket chains have conceded that Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons is anticompetitive, with one executive reacting candidly to the proposed deal: “you are basically creating a monopoly in grocery with the merger.” Inadequate Divestiture Offering To try to secure antitrust approval of their merger, Kroger and Albertsons have proposed to divest several hundred stores and select other assets to C&S Wholesale Grocers (C&S), which today operates just 23 supermarkets and a single retail pharmacy. The FTC’s administrative complaint alleges that Kroger and Albertsons’s inadequate divestiture proposal is a hodgepodge of unconnected stores, banners, brands, and other assets that Kroger’s antitrust lawyers have cobbled together and falls far short of mitigating the lost competition between Kroger and Albertsons. The FTC says the proposed divestitures are not a standalone business, and C&S would face significant obstacles stitching together the various parts and pieces from Kroger and Albertsons into a functioning business—let alone a successful competitor against a combined Kroger and Albertsons. The proposal completely ignores many affected regional and local markets where Kroger and Albertsons compete today. In areas where there are divestitures, the proposal fails to include all of the assets, resources, and capabilities that C&S would need to replicate the competitive intensity that exists today between Kroger and Albertsons. Even if C&S were to survive as an operator, Kroger and Albertsons’s proposed divestitures still do not solve the multitude of competitive issues created by the proposed acquisition, according to the complaint. Harm to Consumers In addition to raising grocery prices, the FTC alleges that Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons would also diminish their incentive to compete on quality. Today, Kroger and Albertsons compete to improve their stores in many ways, including offering fresher produce, higher quality products, improved private label offerings, a broader array of in-store services, flexible store and pharmacy hours, and curbside pickup services. The FTC charges that the deal would eliminate head-to-head price and quality competition, which have driven both supermarkets to lower their prices and improve their product and service offerings. If the merger takes place, grocery prices will increase, and Kroger and Albertsons’ incentive to improve product quality and customer service will decrease, further harming customers. Harm to Workers Kroger and Albertsons are the two largest employers of union grocery labor in the United States. They actively compete against one another for workers. The two companies also try to poach grocery workers from each other, especially in local markets where they overlap. Currently, most workers for both supermarket chains are members of the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) union. Today, UFCW and other unions leverage the fact that Kroger and Albertsons are separate and competing companies. Unions push for both supermarket chains to negotiate better employment terms for union grocery workers, especially when negotiating over collective bargaining agreements (CBAs). A combined Kroger/Albertsons, however, would gain increased leverage over workers and their unions—to the detriment of workers, the FTC alleges. The combined Kroger and Albertsons would have more leverage to impose subpar terms on union grocery workers that slow improvements to wages, worsen benefits, and potentially degrade working conditions. In some regions, such as in Denver, the combined Kroger/Albertsons would be the only employer of union grocery labor. Union grocery workers ability to leverage the threat of a boycott or strike to negotiate better CBA terms would also be weakened. The Offices of the Attorneys General of Arizona, California, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, and Wyoming are joining the Commission’s federal lawsuit. The Commission vote to issue the administrative complaint and authorize staff to seek a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction in federal district court was 3-0. The federal court complaint and request for preliminary relief will be filed jointly with the state attorneys general in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon. NOTE: The Commission issues an administrative complaint when it has “reason to believe” that the law has been or is being violated, and it appears to the Commission that a proceeding is in the public interest. The issuance of the administrative complaint marks the beginning of a proceeding in which the allegations will be tried in a formal hearing before an administrative law judge. The Federal Trade Commission works to promote competition, and protect and educate consumers. The FTC will never demand money, make threats, tell you to transfer money, or promise you a prize.

                "title": "Mitch McConnell - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Addison Mitchell McConnell III[1] (/məˈkɒnəl/; born February 20, 1942) is an American politician and retired attorney who has been serving as Senate minority leader since 2021 and the senior United States senator from Kentucky since 1985, the longest-serving senator in Kentucky history. McConnell has been the leader of the Senate Republican Conference since 2007, including as majority leader from 2015 to 2021, making him the longest-serving Senate party leader in U.S. history. McConnell holds conservative political positions, although he was known as a pragmatist and a moderate Republican early in his political career. He led opposition to stricter campaign finance laws, culminating in the U.S. Supreme Court decision Citizens United v. FEC, which partially overturned the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (McCain-Feingold) in 2010. McConnell worked to withhold Republican support for major presidential initiatives during the Obama administration, making frequent use of the filibuster, and blocked many of President Obama's judicial nominees, including Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland. During the Trump administration, the Senate Republican majority under McConnell's leadership passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act in 2018, the First Step Act, and the Great American Outdoors Act, and confirmed a record number of federal appeals court judges during a president's first two years. McConnell invoked the nuclear option to eliminate the 60-vote requirement to end a filibuster for Supreme Court nominations, after his predecessor Harry Reid had eliminated the filibuster for all other presidential nominations; Trump subsequently won Supreme Court confirmation battles over Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. While supportive of most of Trump's domestic and foreign policies, McConnell criticized Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, and despite voting to acquit in Trump's second impeachment trial for reasons related to the constitutionality of impeaching a former president, deemed him \"practically and morally responsible\" for the January 6 United States Capitol attack.[2] In 2015, 2019 and 2023, Time listed McConnell as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.[3][4] On February 28, 2024, McConnell announced that he would step down as the Senate Republican Conference Leader in January 2025, but would serve the remainder of his Senate term.[5][6][7] An internal election to fill the post of Senate Republican Leader was held on November 13, in which South Dakota senator John Thune was selected.[8] McConnell was born on February 20, 1942, to Julia Odene \"Dean\" (née Shockley) and Addison Mitchell \"A.M.\" McConnell II[9] at Colbert County Hospital in Sheffield, Alabama, and grew up in Athens, Alabama, where his grandfather, Robert Hayes McConnell Sr., and his great-uncle, Addison Mitchell McConnell, owned McConnell Funeral Home.[9][10] He is of Scots-Irish and English descent. His ancestor James McConnell fought on the American side in the American Revolutionary War.[9][11] In 1944, at the age of two, McConnell's upper left leg was paralyzed by a polio attack.[9][12] He and his mother were living with an aunt in Five Points, Alabama, at the time, and he received treatment at the Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation.[13] The treatment potentially saved him from being disabled for the rest of his life.[14] McConnell said his family \"almost went broke\" because of costs related to his illness.[15] In 1950, when he was eight, McConnell moved with his family from Athens to Augusta, Georgia, where his father, who was in the Army, was stationed at Fort Gordon.[16] In 1956, his family moved to Louisville, Kentucky, where he attended duPont Manual High School.[16] McConnell was elected student council president at his high school during his junior year.[16] He graduated Omicron Delta Kappa from the University of Louisville with a B.A. in political science in 1964 with honors.[17] He was president of the Student Council of the College of Arts and Sciences and a member of the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity.[18] McConnell attended the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, where Martin Luther King Jr. gave the \"I Have a Dream\" speech.[19] In 1964, at the age of 22, he attended civil rights rallies,[20] and interned with Senator John Sherman Cooper. He has said his time with Cooper inspired him to run for the Senate later in life.[21][22] In 1967, McConnell graduated from the University of Kentucky College of Law, where he was president of the Student Bar Association.[18][23] In March 1967, shortly before the expiration of his educational draft deferment upon graduation from law school, McConnell enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve as a private at Louisville.[24] This was a coveted position because the Reserve units were mostly kept out of combat during the Vietnam War.[24][25]: 11–12 His first day of training at Fort Knox, Kentucky, was July 9, 1967, two days after taking the bar exam, and his last day was August 15, 1967.[18][24] Shortly after his arrival he was diagnosed with optic neuritis and deemed medically unfit for military service, and was honorably discharged.[24][26] McConnell's political opponents have repeatedly made an issue of his brief time in service during his electoral campaigns.[24][26][27] McConnell first served as a Deputy United States Assistant Attorney General under President Gerald Ford from 1974 until 1975 and then as Jefferson County Judge/Executive from 1977 until 1984 in Kentucky. He was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1984 and is the second Kentuckian to serve as a party leader in the Senate.[28] During the 1998 and 2000 election cycles, he was chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. He was elected Majority Whip to Bill Frist in the 108th Congress and reelected to the post in 2004. In November 2006 he was elected Senate minority leader, the post he held until Republicans took control of the Senate in 2015. From 1968 to 1970, McConnell worked as chief legislative assistant to Senator Marlow Cook in Washington, D.C., managing a legislative department consisting of five members as well as assisting with speechwriting and constituent services.[29] In 1971, McConnell returned to Louisville, where he worked on Tom Emberton's campaign for governor of Kentucky, which was unsuccessful.[29] McConnell attempted to run for a seat in the state legislature but was disqualified because he did not meet the residency requirements for the office.[29] He then worked for the Louisville law firm Segal, Isenberg, Sales and Stewart for a few years.[30][29] During the same period, he taught a night class on political science at the University of Louisville.[23][31][32] In October 1974, McConnell returned to Washington to fill a position as Deputy Assistant Attorney General under President Ford, where he worked alongside Robert Bork, Laurence Silberman, and Antonin Scalia.[23][29] He also served as acting United States Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legislative Affairs under President Ford in 1975.[33][34] In 1977, McConnell was elected the Jefferson County judge/executive, the top political office in Jefferson County, Kentucky, at the time, defeating incumbent Democrat Todd Hollenbach III, 53% to 47%. He was reelected in 1981 against Jefferson County Commissioner Jim \"Pop\" Malone, 51% to 47%, outspending Malone 3–1, and occupied the office until his election to the U.S. Senate in 1984.[21][29] In his early years as a politician in Kentucky, McConnell was known as a pragmatist and a moderate Republican.[21][25] Over time he became more conservative.[21][25] According to one of his biographers, McConnell transformed \"from a moderate Republican who supported abortion rights and public employee unions to the embodiment of partisan obstructionism and conservative orthodoxy on Capitol Hill.\"[25] McConnell has widely been described as an obstructionist.[35] From 1997 to 2001, McConnell chaired the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the body charged with securing electoral victories for Republicans.[36][37] On February 12, 1999, he was one of 50 senators to vote to convict and remove Bill Clinton from office.[38] He was first elected Majority Whip in the 108th Congress.[39] Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist did not seek reelection in the 2006 elections. In November, after Republicans lost control of the Senate, they elected McConnell minority leader.[40] After Republicans took control of the Senate following the 2014 Senate elections, McConnell became the Senate Majority Leader.[41] In June 2018 he became the longest-serving Senate Republican leader in U.S. history.[42] McConnell is the second Kentuckian to serve as a party leader in the Senate (after Alben W. Barkley led the Democrats from 1937 to 1949)[17] and the longest-serving U.S. senator from Kentucky.[43] McConnell has a reputation as a skilled political strategist and tactician.[44][45][46][47] This reputation dimmed after Republicans failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) in 2017 during consolidated Republican control of government.[48][49][50][51] McConnell regularly obtained earmarks for businesses and institutions in Kentucky until Congress banned the practice in 2010.[52] He has been criticized for funding \"temporary patches\" to Kentucky's long-term healthcare problems while simultaneously opposing and obstructing national programs that seek to improve healthcare more systematically, such as Obamacare and Medicaid expansion.[32] Defunct Newspapers Journals TV channels Websites Other Economics Gun rights Identity politics Nativist Religion Watchdog groups Youth/student groups Miscellaneous Other As the leading Republican senator, McConnell confronted and pressured other Republican senators who were willing to negotiate with Democrats and the Obama administration.[53] According to Purdue University political scientist Bert A. Rockman, \"pure party line voting has been evident now for some time ... but rarely has the tactic of 'oppositionism' been so boldly stated as McConnell did.\"[54] According to University of Texas legal scholar Sanford Levinson, McConnell learned that obstruction and Republican unity were the optimal ways to ensure Republican gains in upcoming elections after he observed how Democratic cooperation with the Bush administration on No Child Left Behind and Medicare Part D helped Bush's 2004 reelection.[55] Levinson noted, \"McConnell altogether rationally ... concluded that Republicans have nothing to gain, as a political party, from collaborating in anything that the president could then claim as an achievement.\"[55] A number of political scientists, historians, and legal scholars have characterized McConnell's obstructionism and constitutional hardball as contributors to democratic erosion in the United States.[56][57][58][59] In October 2010, McConnell said, \"the single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.\" Asked whether this meant \"endless, or at least frequent, confrontation with the president\", McConnell said, \"if [Obama is] willing to meet us halfway on some of the biggest issues, it's not inappropriate for us to do business with him.\"[60] According to political scientists Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson, \"Facing off against Obama, [McConnell] worked to deny even minimal Republican support for major presidential initiatives—initiatives that were, as a rule, in keeping with the moderate model of decades past, and often with moderate Republican stances of a few years past.\"[61] The New York Times wrote early in Obama's administration that \"on the major issues—not just health care, but financial regulation and the economic stimulus package, among others—Mr. McConnell has held Republican defections to somewhere between minimal and nonexistent, allowing him to slow the Democratic agenda if not defeat aspects of it.\"[62] The Republican caucus threatened repeatedly to force the United States to default on its debt, McConnell saying he had learned from the 2011 debt-ceiling crisis that \"it's a hostage that's worth ransoming\".[63][64] McConnell worked to delay and obstruct health care reform and banking reform, two of the most notable pieces of legislation that Democrats navigated through Congress early in Obama's tenure.[65][66] Political scientists noted that \"by slowing action even on measures supported by many Republicans, McConnell capitalized on the scarcity of floor time, forcing Democratic leaders into difficult trade-offs concerning which measures were worth pursuing. ... Slowing the Senate's ability to process even routine measures limited the sheer volume of liberal bills that could be adopted.\"[66] One of McConnell's most common tactics as minority leader to delay or obstruct legislation and judicial appointments was the filibuster. A filibuster is an attempt to \"talk a bill to death\", forcing Senate leadership to abandon a proposed measure instead of waiting out the filibuster―or at least to delay the measure's passage. In the Senate, any senator may speak for unlimited duration unless a 60-person majority votes to invoke cloture, or end debate, and proceed to a final vote. Political scientists have referred to McConnell's use of the filibuster as \"constitutional hardball\", referring to the misuse of procedural tools in a way that undermines democracy.[61][64][57][67] Political scientists Hacker and Pierson describe the rationale behind McConnell's filibusters: \"Filibusters left no fingerprints. When voters heard that legislation had been 'defeated', journalists rarely highlighted that this defeat meant a minority had blocked a majority. Not only did this strategy produce an atmosphere of gridlock and dysfunction; it also chewed up the Senate calendar, restricting the range of issues on which Democrats could progress.\"[61] In 2013, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid eliminated the filibuster for all presidential nominations except the Supreme Court. By that time, nearly half of all votes to invoke cloture in the history of the Senate had occurred during Obama's presidency.[58] In April 2017, Senate Republicans led by McConnell eliminated the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations in order to end debate on the nomination of Neil Gorsuch.[68][69][70] In August 2019, McConnell wrote an editorial for The New York Times strongly opposing the elimination of the filibuster on legislation.[71] McConnell initially endorsed fellow Kentucky senator Rand Paul for president in 2016. Paul withdrew from the race after the Iowa caucuses, and McConnell endorsed presumptive nominee Donald Trump on May 4, 2016.[72] But McConnell disagreed with Trump on many occasions. In May 2016, after Trump suggested that federal judge Gonzalo P. Curiel was biased against Trump because of his Mexican heritage, McConnell said: \"I don't agree with what [Trump] had to say. This is a man who was born in Indiana. All of us came here from somewhere else.\" In July 2016, after Trump criticized the parents of Humayun Khan, a Muslim-American soldier who was killed in Iraq, McConnell said, \"All Americans should value the patriotic service of the patriots who volunteer to selflessly defend us in the armed services.\" On October 7, 2016, following the Donald Trump Access Hollywood controversy, McConnell said, \"As the father of three daughters, I strongly believe that Trump needs to apologize directly to women and girls everywhere, and take full responsibility for the utter lack of respect for women shown in his comments on that tape.\"[73] In private, McConnell reportedly expresses disdain for Trump[74] and \"abhors\" his behavior.[75] In October 2017, White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon and other Trump allies blamed McConnell for stalling the Trump administration's legislation. In response, McConnell cited Neil Gorsuch's confirmation to the Supreme Court to show that the Senate supported Trump's agenda.[76] After Joe Biden defeated Trump in the 2020 election, McConnell at first refused to recognize Biden as the winner.[77][78][79] In his public statements, McConnell did not repeat any of Trump's false claims of voter fraud, but did not contradict them, ignoring questions about evidence and instead arguing that Trump had the right to challenge the results.[78][80][81] At the same time that McConnell refused to recognize Biden, he celebrated Republicans who won their Senate and House races in the same elections.[78][80][82] On December 15, the day after the electoral college vote, McConnell reversed his stance and publicly acknowledged Biden's win, saying, \"Today, I want to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden.\"[83] On January 6, during the Electoral College vote count, McConnell spoke out against the efforts of Trump and his allies to overturn the election: Trump claims the election was stolen. The assertions range from specific local allegations to constitutional arguments to sweeping conspiracy theories ... nothing before us proves illegality anywhere near the massive scale—the massive scale—that would have tipped the entire election. ... If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral. We'd never see the whole nation accept an election again. Every four years would be a scramble for power at any cost.[84] Later that day, he described the storming of the Capitol building (which occurred while the Electoral College votes were being counted) as a \"failed insurrection\" that \"tried to disrupt our democracy\".[85] On April 10, 2021, Trump called McConnell a \"dumb son of a bitch\". Trump added: \"I hired his wife. Did he ever say thank you?\"[86] Trump has continued to attack McConnell in personal terms since then, but McConnell has not responded publicly.[87][88] On November 5, 2019, as the House of Representatives began public hearings on the impeachment of President Trump, McConnell said, \"I'm pretty sure how [an impeachment trial is] likely to end. ... If it were today, I don't think there's any question. It would not lead to a removal.\"[89] On December 14, 2019, McConnell met with White House counsel Pat Cipollone and White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland. Later that day, he said that for Trump's impeachment trial, he would be in \"total coordination with the White House counsel's office\" and Trump's representatives.[90][91] He also said there was \"no chance\" the Senate would convict Trump and remove him from office.[92] On December 17, 2019, McConnell rejected a request to call four witnesses for Trump's impeachment trial because, according to McConnell, the Senate's role was to \"act as judge and jury\", not to investigate. Later that day, McConnell told the media: \"I'm not an impartial juror [in this impeachment trial]. This is a political process. There's not anything judicial about it.\"[93][94] After Trump's acquittal, McConnell was noted for his ability to block witnesses, to secure Trump's acquittal, and to maintain party unity during the impeachment process. Commentators noted that he had kept Republican senators \"marching in lockstep\" throughout the process.[95][96][97] On January 12, 2021, it was reported that McConnell supported impeaching Trump for his role in inciting the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol, believing it would make it easier for Republicans to purge the party of Trump and rebuild the party.[98] On January 13, despite having the authority to call for an emergency meeting of the Senate to hold the Senate trial,[failed verification] McConnell did not reconvene the chamber, claiming unanimous consent was required.[99] He called for delaying the Senate trial until after Biden's inauguration.[100] Once the Senate trial started, McConnell voted to acquit Trump on February 13, 2021, saying it was unconstitutional to convict a president who was no longer in office.[101] The vote to convict was a bipartisan majority (57–43) but not enough to pass the two-thirds threshold.[102] After the vote, McConnell lambasted and condemned Trump in a 20-minute speech on the Senate floor, saying he believed Trump was guilty of everything the House managers alleged.[103][104] He said: Former President Trump's actions preceding the riot were a disgraceful dereliction of duty ... There is no question that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of that day ... If President Trump were still in office, I would have carefully considered whether the House managers proved their specific charge.[105] He explained why he nonetheless voted to acquit: \"Article II, Section 4 must have force. It tells us the President, Vice President, and civil officers may be impeached and convicted. Donald Trump is no longer the president. Clearly that mandatory sentence cannot be applied to somebody who has left office. The entire process revolves around removal. If removal becomes impossible, conviction becomes insensible.\" Yet he said that Trump \"didn't get away with anything yet\" since Trump would remain subject to the country's criminal and civil laws.[105] When there was a proposal for an independent commission to investigate the January 6 United States Capitol attack, McConnell sought to organize Republican senators to filibuster it,[106] and on May 28, 2021, he voted against its creation.[107] McConnell's relationship with the Biden administration has been portrayed in media as one of comity. Biden has described McConnell as \"a friend, colleague and 'man of his word.'\" McConnell has praised bipartisan legislation they worked on together, and was the only Republican to attend the 2015 funeral of Biden's son Beau Biden.[108] In October 2021, McConnell helped pass a bill that extended the debt ceiling. He convinced 11 Republicans to vote with the Democrats for it, without which the United States would have defaulted on its debts.[109] Throughout Obama's tenure, McConnell led Senate Republicans in what has been called \"a disciplined, sustained, at times underhanded campaign to deny the Democratic president the opportunity to appoint federal judges\".[110] In June 2009, after Obama nominated Sonia Sotomayor as associate justice, McConnell and Jeff Sessions opined that Sotomayor's 17 years as a federal judge and over 3,600 judicial opinions would require lengthy review and advocated against Democrats hastening the confirmation process.[111] On July 17, McConnell announced that he would vote against Sotomayor's confirmation.[112] In August, McConnell called Sotomayor \"a fine person with an impressive story and a distinguished background\" but said he did not believe she would withhold her personal or political views while serving as a justice. Sotomayor was confirmed days later.[113] In May 2010, after President Obama nominated Elena Kagan to succeed the retiring John Paul Stevens, McConnell said in a Senate speech that Americans wanted to make sure Kagan would be independent of influence from White House as an associate justice and noted that Obama called Kagan a friend of his in announcing her nomination.[114] McConnell announced his opposition to Kagan's confirmation, saying she was not forthcoming enough about her \"views on basic principles of American constitutional law\".[115] Kagan was confirmed the next month.[116] In 2014, Republicans gained control of the Senate, and McConnell became majority leader; he used his new power to start what was considered \"a near blockade\" of Obama's judicial appointments. According to The New York Times, Obama's final two years as president saw 18 district court judges and one appeals court judge confirmed, the fewest since President Harry S. Truman. In comparison, the final two years of the presidencies of George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Ronald Reagan had between 55 and 70 district court judges each confirmed and between 10 and 15 appeals court judges confirmed.[110] The Los Angeles Times wrote that McConnell brought about an \"extraordinary two-year slowdown in judicial confirmations\", detailing 22 confirmations of Obama's judicial nominees, the lowest since Truman in 1951–1952. The number of federal judicial vacancies at the end of Obama's term was more than twice the number at the end of George W. Bush's term.[117][118] In a 2019 interview, McConnell credited himself for the large number of judicial vacancies created in the last two years of Obama's presidency.[90] On February 13, 2016, Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia died.[119] Shortly thereafter, McConnell issued a statement indicating that the Senate would not consider any Supreme Court nominee Obama put forth.[22][120] \"The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president\", McConnell said.[120] On March 16, 2016, Obama nominated Merrick Garland, a Judge of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, to the Supreme Court.[121] Under McConnell's direction, Senate Republicans refused to take any action on the nomination.[122] Garland's nomination expired on January 3, 2017, with the end of the 114th Congress.[123] In an August 2016 speech in Kentucky, McConnell said, \"one of my proudest moments was when I looked Barack Obama in the eye and I said, 'Mr. President, you will not fill the Supreme Court vacancy.'\"[124][125] In April 2018, McConnell said the decision not to act on Garland's nomination was \"the most consequential decision I've made in my entire public career\".[126] Political scientists and legal scholars called McConnell's refusal to hold Senate hearings on Garland \"unprecedented\",[127][128] a \"culmination of [his] confrontational style\",[129] a \"blatant abuse of constitutional norms\",[59] and a \"classic example of constitutional hardball\".[64] In January 2017, President Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left after Scalia's death.[130] Gorsuch's nomination was confirmed on April 7, 2017, after McConnell eliminated the filibuster on Supreme Court nominees.[131] On July 18, 2018, with Andy Oldham's Senate confirmation, Senate Republicans broke a record for largest number of appeals court judiciary confirmations during a president's first two years; Oldham became the 23rd appeals court judge confirmed in Trump's term.[132] McConnell said he considers the judiciary to be the item of Trump's first two years with the longest-lasting impact on the country. The record for the number of circuit court judges confirmed during a president's first year was broken in 2017, while the previous two-year record of 22 confirmations took place under President George H. W. Bush.[133] By March 2020, McConnell had contacted an unknown number of judges, encouraging them to retire before the 2020 election.[134][135] He confirmed 260 federal judges during Trump's four-year term, shifting the federal judiciary to the right. In July 2018, Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh to replace the retiring Anthony Kennedy as an associate justice of the Supreme Court. McConnell accused Democrats of creating an \"extreme\" distortion of Kavanaugh's record during his hearings.[136] In September 2018, Christine Blasey Ford publicly alleged that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her in 1982. After it was reported that Democrats were investigating a second allegation against Kavanaugh, McConnell said, \"I want to make it perfectly clear. ... Judge Kavanaugh will be voted on here on the Senate floor.\"[137] Kavanaugh was confirmed on October 6.[138][139] McConnell said the confirmation process was a low point for the Senate, but also downplayed reports of dysfunction in the Senate; he said claims that the Senate was \"somehow broken over this [were] simply inaccurate\".[140] In October 2018, McConnell said if a Supreme Court vacancy were to occur in 2020, he would not repeat his 2016 decision to let the winner of the upcoming presidential election nominate a justice. He argued that because in 2016 the Senate was controlled by a party other than the president's, the 2016 precedent was not applicable in 2020, when Republicans controlled both the presidency and Senate.[141] In September 2020, after Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, he announced the Senate would vote on Trump's nominated replacement.[142] On October 23, McConnell set in place the Senate debate on the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to fill Ginsburg's seat. Barrett was confirmed on October 26.[143] The federal government shut down on October 1–17, 2013, after Congress failed to enact legislation to fund it. McConnell later vowed Republicans would not force the U.S. to default on its debt or shut down the government in 2014, when stopgap funding measures were set to expire. He also said he would not allow other Republicans to obstruct the budget-making process.[144][145] In July 2018, McConnell said funding for the Mexico–United States border wall would likely have to wait until the midterms had concluded. Trump tweeted two days later that he was willing to allow a government shutdown to get funding.[146] Several spending bills were approved that August; the approvals were seen as a victory for McConnell in his attempts to prevent another government shutdown.[147] From December 22, 2018, until January 25, 2019, the federal government shut down when Congress refused to give in to Trump's demand for $5.7 billion in federal funds for a U.S.–Mexico border wall.[148] In December 2018, the Republican-controlled Senate unanimously passed an appropriations bill without wall funding, and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and Trump appeared likely to approve the bill. After Trump faced heavy criticism from some right-wing media outlets and pundits for appearing to back down on his campaign promise to \"build the wall\", he said he would not sign any appropriations bill that did not fund the wall.[149] During this shutdown, McConnell blocked the Senate from voting on appropriations legislation and said it was not his place to mediate between the Senate and Trump.[150][151][152] Privately, McConnell had advised Trump against initiating the shutdown.[22] Democrats criticized McConnell for not putting appropriations legislation up for a vote, noting that the Republican-controlled Senate had unanimously passed an appropriations bill without wall funding and that the Senate could override Trump's veto.[150][151][152] By January 23, McConnell had blocked four Senate bills to reopen the government and a bill funding the Homeland Security Department through February 8. He called for Democrats to support a Trump administration-backed measure that included $5.7 billion in wall funding, together with a temporary extension of protections for DACA recipients, a Democratic priority.[153] Privately, other Republican senators pressured McConnell to stop blocking appropriations legislation.[154][155] The shutdown ended on January 25, when Trump signed a three-week funding measure reopening the government until February 15 without funds for a border wall.[156] This was the longest government shutdown in American history.[22][157] In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, McConnell initially opposed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, calling it a Democratic \"ideological wish list\".[158][159] He reversed his position when Trump endorsed the proposed package.[160] The bill passed in the Senate by a vote of 90–8. McConnell also directed Senate Republicans in negotiations for two other COVID-19 response packages: the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020 and the CARES Act. The CARES Act was the largest economic stimulus package in U.S. history,[161] amounting to 10% of total U.S. gross domestic product.[162] It passed both houses of Congress with bipartisan support.[163] Speaking on the Hugh Hewitt radio show on April 22, 2020, McConnell suggested that states should be able to declare bankruptcy instead of receiving additional COVID-19 aid funds—funds he implied would be used to save insolvent state pension funds instead of for COVID-19 relief. His comments were sharply criticized by various state and local officials. States cannot declare bankruptcy.[164] After the CARES Act passed, McConnell waited several months before advancing any additional COVID-19 relief measures in the Senate, saying in May, \"I don't think we have yet felt the urgency of acting immediately\" and that Congress should \"[hit] pause\" to evaluate how the allocated funds were working before approving more.[165] He was absent from negotiations between congressional Democrats and White House officials for an additional aid package.[166][167][168] On September 10, 2020, a pared-down COVID-19 relief bill crafted by McConnell failed to pass the Senate because of a Democratic filibuster.[169] Democrats called the bill \"completely inadequate\" given the scope of the COVID-19 crisis[170] and a partisan maneuver to help Republican senators up for reelection.[171] McConnell called the bill a choice between \"do[ing] something\" and \"do[ing] nothing\",[172] and said he was holding the procedural vote to get lawmakers on the record about their willingness to compromise on COVID-19 legislation.[173] As the leader of the Senate Republicans, McConnell has received much of the criticism and disapproval that Republicans receive from Democratic voters, receiving near uniform disapproval from left-of-center voters. Furthermore, as a result of his unpopularity with Trump and the more populist base, McConnell has had historically low approval for a senator by the electorate as a whole: a 2012 poll and a 2016 poll each found that McConnell had the lowest home-state approval rating of any sitting senator.[174][175] With a 49% disapproval rate in 2017, McConnell had the highest disapproval rating of any senator.[176] In September 2019, the Morning Consult found that McConnell's approval rating had been underwater since the first quarter of 2017, when it was 44% positive and 47% negative. The worst rating since that time was in the fourth quarter of 2018, when he had a 38% positive rating and a 47% negative rating among Kentuckians.[177] At that time he was briefly not the least popular senator, surpassed by Claire McCaskill and Jeff Flake.[178] But as of the second quarter of 2019, McConnell's ratings were 36% positive and 50% negative. He netted −56 among Democrats, +29 among Republicans, and −24 among Independents.[177] An average of polls by the Economist/YouGov, Politico/Morning Consult, and Harvard-Harris from the end of July through August 2019 (7/31–8/27), was 23% favorable and 48% unfavorable (−25.0 spread).[179] In 2020, according to Morning Consult, Susan Collins edged out McConnell as the least popular senator with a 52% unfavorable rating from Maine voters compared to 50% for McConnell.[180] McConnell's committee assignments for the 118th Congress are as follows:[181] McConnell has taken conservative stances for the past several decades. During his Senate tenure, McConnell led opposition to stricter campaign finance laws,[182] culminating in the Supreme Court ruling that partially overturned the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (McCain-Feingold) in 2010. He led opposition against Obamacare,[183] first through efforts to delay or prevent the law's passage, and later to repeal or replace it, including via the American Healthcare Reform Act. McConnell has opposed stronger regulations, gun control measures and efforts to mitigate climate change. He has criticized proposed legislation by House Democrats such as the Green New Deal and Medicare for All,[184] and was criticized by Nancy Pelosi for withholding votes on measures passed by the Democratic-controlled House during his time as Senate Majority Leader, including the For the People Act of 2019, the Equality Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act.[185] McConnell has supported stronger border security, free trade agreements and reductions in taxes. As Senate Majority Leader, he led the passing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act in 2018. His foreign policy views have included support of sanctions on Cuba, Iran and Russia,[186] support of Ukraine during its invasion by Russia,[187] opposition to the Iran nuclear deal and support of Israel in its war with Hamas.[188] He voted for the Iraq Resolution, which authorized military action against Iraq,[189] and supported the Iraq War troop surge of 2007 in public.[190] Earlier in his political career, during the 1960s and 1970s, McConnell held moderate stances, including support of abortions, support of unions, and support of the civil rights movement.[191] Following the Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, McConnell expressed his opposition to same-sex marriage stating “I’ve always felt that marriage is between one man and one woman and the Supreme Court has held otherwise. That’s the law of the land.”[192] In 1984, McConnell ran for the U.S. Senate against two-term Democratic incumbent Walter Dee Huddleston. The election race was not decided until the last returns came in, when McConnell won by 3,437 votes out of more than 1.2 million votes cast, just over 0.4%.[193] McConnell was the only Republican Senate challenger to win that year, despite Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in the presidential election.[194] McConnell's campaign was noted for a series of television campaign spots called \"Where's Dee\", which featured a group of bloodhounds trying to find Huddleston,[195][better source needed][196] implying that Huddleston's attendance record in the Senate was poor.[197][198] He was the first Republican to win a statewide election in Kentucky since 1968, and benefited from the popularity of President Ronald Reagan, up for re-election, who was supported by 60% of Kentucky voters in the same year.[44] In 1990, McConnell faced former Louisville Mayor Harvey I. Sloane, winning by 4.4%.[199] In 1996, he defeated Steve Beshear by 12.6%,[200] even as Bill Clinton narrowly carried the state. McConnell's campaign ran television ads warning voters to not \"Get BeSheared\" and included images of sheep being sheared.[198] In 2002, he was unopposed in the Republican primary. He then defeated Lois Combs Weinberg by 29.4%.[201] In 2008, McConnell faced his closest contest since 1990. He defeated Bruce Lunsford by 6%.[23] In 2014, McConnell faced Louisville businessman Matt Bevin in the Republican primary.[202] The 60.2% won by McConnell was the lowest voter support for a Kentucky U.S. senator in a primary since 1938.[203] He faced Democratic Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes in the general election, and defeated Grimes, 56.2–40.7%.[204][205] In the November 2020 general election, McConnell faced Democratic nominee Amy McGrath, a former Marine fighter pilot; and Libertarian nominee Brad Barron, a businessman and farmer.[206][207] During the campaign, McConnell and McGrath agreed to one hour-long, socially distanced debate on October 12.[208][209] McConnell was elected to his seventh term on November 3 when he defeated McGrath by nearly 20 percentage points.[210] McConnell is a Southern Baptist, baptized at age 8.[211] He was married to his first wife, Sherrill Redmon, from 1968 to 1980 and had three daughters, Porter, Eleanor (Elly), and Claire.[212][213][214] Porter McConnell is the campaign director for Take on Wall Street, a left-wing advocacy coalition.[215][216] Following her divorce from McConnell, Redmon became a feminist scholar at Smith College and director of the Sophia Smith Collection.[217][218] McConnell's second wife, whom he married in 1993, is Elaine Chao, Secretary of Labor under President George W. Bush and Secretary of Transportation under President Donald Trump.[219] In May 2019, McConnell's brother-in-law Gordon Hartogensis, who is married to Chao's sister Grace, was confirmed by the U.S. Senate as director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), a part of the Labor Department.[220][221][222] McConnell voted to confirm.[223] In February 2003, McConnell underwent a triple heart bypass surgery in relation to blocked arteries, at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.[224] In August 2019, McConnell suffered a fall at his Louisville home; he fractured his shoulder.[225] In March 2023, he was hospitalized for five days after a fall; he was treated for a concussion and a minor rib fracture,[226] and did not return to the Senate for almost six weeks.[227] In July 2023, he fell while disembarking from a plane at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.[228] On July 26, 2023, McConnell prompted worldwide media reports when he froze, unspeaking, for around 20 seconds while addressing a press conference.[229] He was escorted away by aides, but later returned and said he was \"fine\".[230] Two days after the incident, his spokespersons said that McConnell would continue in his leadership role; he is the institution's longest-serving party leader.[231] On August 30, 2023, he again froze during a press conference in Covington, Kentucky and was eventually led away by staff.[232] A day later, McConnell released a letter from the attending physician of Congress that said that he was \"medically clear\" to continue his schedule as planned;[233] the letter said that the physician had talked to McConnell and \"conferred with his neurology team\", but did not indicate that he had physically examined McConnell.[234] In 1997, McConnell founded the James Madison Center for Free Speech, a legal-defense organization based in Washington, D.C.[235][236] He was inducted into the Sons of the American Revolution on March 1, 2013.[237] He is on the Board of Selectors of Jefferson Awards for Public Service.[238] In 2018, the OpenSecrets website ranked McConnell one of the wealthiest members of the U.S. Senate, with a net worth of more than $25 million.[239] His personal wealth grew in 2008, when he and his wife received a gift worth about $5 million to about $25 million from her father, James S. C. Chao, after the death of his wife.[240] McConnell's detractors have called him by a number of nicknames, including \"Moscow Mitch\",[241] \"Cocaine Mitch\",[241] the \"Grim Reaper\",[184] \"Darth Vader\",[242] \"Rich Mitch\",[243] \"Nuclear Mitch\",[242] \"Midnight Mitch\",[244] and \"Old Crow\".[245] McConnell embraces several of them, but he has objected strenuously to \"Moscow Mitch\".[241][246] Jon Stewart repeatedly mocked McConnell on The Daily Show for resembling a turtle or tortoise.[247][248] McConnell has been portrayed by Beck Bennett in sketches on Saturday Night Live.[249] In 2017, McConnell was portrayed satirically in South Park's season 21 episode \"Doubling Down\".[250] During the 2014 election campaign, McConnell was lampooned for posting campaign B-roll footage online for use by allied PACs. Various Internet posters satirically interspersed the B-roll with footage from sitcoms and movies and with popular music. The practice of posting B-roll footage online for use by PACs or of lampooning the B-roll was termed \"McConnelling\".[251][252][253] In 2015, 2019, and 2023, Time listed McConnell as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.[3][4][254]",

                "content": "Addison Mitchell \"Mitch\" McConnell, Jr. (born February 20, 1942) is the senior United States Senator from Kentucky. A member of the Republican Party, he is the Minority Leader of the Senate, succeeding Chuck Schumer. He is the longest-serving U.S. Senator in Kentucky history.[2] McConnell holds conservative positions, despite regarding as a moderate Republican early in his career. Mitch McConnell was born to Julia (née Shockley) and Addison Mitchell McConnell at Helen Keller Memorial Hospital in Sheffield, Alabama on February 20, 1942.[3][4] [5]He grew up in segregated Athens, Alabama.[6] They moved to southern Louisville, Kentucky and McConnell attended the duPont Manual High School. In 1964, he graduated with honors from the University of Louisville with a B.A. in political science. He graduated in 1967 from the University of Kentucky College of Law. In 1984, McConnell ran for the United States Senate against two-term Democratic incumbent Walter \"Dee\" Huddleston. The election race wasn't decided until the last polls returned came in, and McConnell won by a thin margin—only 5,200 votes out of more than 1.8 million votes cast, just over 0.4%.[7] McConnell was the only Republican Senate challenger to win that year, despite Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in the presidential election. Part of McConnell's success came from a series of television campaign spots called \"Where's Dee\", which featured a group of bloodhounds trying to find Huddleston,[8][9] implying that Huddleston's attendance record in the Senate was less than stellar. It is likely that he was helped by Ronald Reagan's 21-point win in Kentucky that year. His campaign bumper stickers and television ads asked voters to \"Switch to Mitch\". McConnell has repeatedly been found to have the lowest home state approval rating of any sitting senator.[10][11] McConnell is a member of the Baptist Church. His first wife was Sherrill Redmon,[12] from whom he was later divorced; they have three daughters. His second wife, whom he married in 1993, is Elaine Chao, the Secretary of Transportation under Donald Trump and the former Secretary of Labor under George W. Bush (the first Asian American woman to serve in the Cabinet). Senator McConnell's personal fortune was between $9,839,049 to $44,587,000 in 2010 and he was ranked as the 10th wealthiest member of the U.S. Senate.[13] In October 2024, the first autobiographical book, \"The Price of Power: How Mitch McConnell Mastered the Senate, Changed America, and Lost His Party\", about Mitch McConnell, will be released in the United States.[14]",

                "content": "In an era when many politicians pride themselves on being outsiders, Mitch McConnell has a reputation as a consummate creature of the DC establishment. Representing Kentucky in the Senate since 1985, Mr McConnell has won a reputation as a shrewd and tactical campaigner - even if few have found him a particularly charismatic figure. On Wednesday he announced that he would be giving up his post as Republican leader in the US Senate, which he has held for nearly two decades, after November's elections. Mr McConnell is already the longest-serving party leader in Senate history, having been elected to the leadership post a record nine times by his fellow Senate Republicans. As leader, he's been at the helm of some of Washington's most consequential decisions. Inscrutable, adaptable and a hard-charging deal-maker, Mr McConnell has earned both begrudging admirers and loathing critics. But in recent years, the 82-year-old has faced questions about his health, and he's regularly sparred with Donald Trump and the former president's supporters. In making the announcement that he was stepping down from the leadership post, Mr McConnell said: \"It's time for the next generation of leadership.\" Addison Mitchell McConnell III was born in Alabama in 1942 to working-class parents of English and Scots-Irish descent. At the age of two, he contracted polio, which left a portion of his left leg paralysed and saw him bullied by other kids. He has credited extensive physical rehabilitation and a protective mother with making sure he could walk again, adding that his family \"almost went broke\" covering his treatment. The McConnells moved to Kentucky in 1956 and their son went on to serve as student council president both in high school and at the University of Louisville, where he graduated with honours in 1964. His first foray on Capitol Hill came as a 22-year-old intern to Republican Senator John Sherman Cooper of Kentucky - an experience that convinced him to \"give [the Senate] a shot if I ever had a chance\". It was also a period of time that he has said bolstered his commitment to civil rights. He watched Martin Luther King Jr's \"I Have a Dream\" speech from the steps of the Capitol, and stood beside his boss in the Capitol rotunda as the Voting Rights Act was signed into law. Mitch McConnell as a young senator After graduating from the University of Kentucky Law School, where he led the Student Bar Association, he went on to serve as an assistant attorney general under President Gerald Ford. In 1977, he successfully ran for judge-executive, the top political office in his home county in Kentucky. He has never lost an election since. As a young Republican from what was then a Democratic-leaning state, Mr McConnell was far more of a pragmatic centrist than he is today. When he won his first Senate race, upsetting a Democratic incumbent in 1984, it was the first time a Republican had won state-wide in Kentucky in 16 years. In the Senate, Mr McConnell gradually shifted toward the conservatism pulling his state and his party to the right. He had been supported by labour groups in his early career, but he turned his back on fights for collective bargaining rights and minimum wage increases. Under the banner of free speech, he fiercely resisted efforts to limit spending on political campaigns. And as a representative for coal-rich Kentucky, he vocally denied the impacts of global warming for years and opposed climate regulations he often claimed were a threat to the economy. In 1993, Mr McConnell married Elaine Chao, a Taiwanese-American immigrant who later joined the cabinet of Presidents George W Bush and Donald Trump. Mr McConnell with his wife Elaine Chao His profile grew after he was elected by his Republican colleagues in 2006 to lead their Senate caucus. As Barack Obama entered the White House, and the populist Tea Party movement reshaped the Republican Party in its anti-establishment, norm-breaking image, Mr McConnell took the hint. He railed against the president's signature healthcare and financial reforms, and set records with his use of a procedural tool called the filibuster to thwart the Obama agenda, helping transform a collegial Senate into the fiercely partisan chamber it is today. In 2010, he made headlines when he famously declared his party's \"number one priority\" was to make Mr Obama a one-term president. But he also knew when to reach across the aisle for compromise. In 2012, he cut an 11th-hour deal with then-Vice President Joe Biden to save the country from a catastrophic default on its public debt. The following year, his meetings with Democratic leaders helped end a government shutdown. Republicans retook control of the Senate in 2014 and Mr McConnell fulfilled his dream of becoming the chamber's majority leader. The pattern of Mr McConnell routinely blocking Democratic-led initiatives in the Senate has earned him the moniker of the \"Grim Reaper\", a nickname he embraces. Perhaps his most famous act of obstruction came in 2016 when he refused to allow Mr Obama, in his final year in office, to fill a vacant Supreme Court seat. The move infuriated Democrats, but paid off the following year when the newly elected President Trump filled the seat with a conservative jurist. The Trump years saw two more justices added to the nation's top court, cementing a 6-3 conservative majority that has since made consequential rulings on abortion, gun rights and several other issues. The majority leader's intense focus on transforming the judiciary also contributed to Mr Trump appointing more than 200 new federal judges during his four-year term. Mr McConnell had a consequential, albeit uneasy, alliance with President Donald Trump But the McConnell-Trump alliance was uneasy from the outset and their increasing disagreements burst into the open after the then-president falsely claimed the 2020 election was stolen from him. Mr McConnell slammed him as being \"morally responsible\" for the January 2021 attack on the US Capitol, although he did not vote to impeach Mr Trump over it. The feud has only intensified since then, with Mr Trump attacking Mr McConnell's wife and the senator mocking his \"diminished\" status. Mr McConnell has never faced serious opposition for his Senate seat or his leadership role, but surveys show he is one of the most unpopular politicians in the country. His tactics have earned him few Democratic fans, though one Kentucky colleague once described him as \"the Tiger Woods of politics\", while the right flank of his own party increasingly reviles someone they view as an establishment swamp monster. Recently he has advocated rather forcefully for his party to keep defending Ukraine in its war against Russia and to turn away from its Trumpian inclinations towards a platform with broader appeal to voters. But like the presidential front-runners, he has faced increasing questions about his health and advancing age. This video can not be played Watch: McConnell freezes during press event The lawmaker missed nearly six weeks of Senate votes last year after falling at a DC hotel and suffering a concussion. US media also reported on three other falls in 2023, with NBC News reporting he sometimes uses a wheelchair to navigate airports. And in two other incidents, he froze abruptly at press conferences. On both occasions, his office said he had simply paused because he \"felt light-headed\". The reports led to speculation about whether he was still capable of the job. But it now appears that instead of facing another leadership contest after the upcoming elections, he has decided to give up the post at a time of his own choosing. Mr McConnell has, however, said he will serve out the remainder of his Senate term, which runs until January 2027.

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Mitch McConnell (born February 20, 1942, Tuscumbia, Alabama, U.S.) is an influential Republican politician who has represented Kentucky in the U.S. Senate since 1985. The longest-serving Senate party leader, McConnell has been the majority whip (2003–07), minority leader (2007–15; 2021– ), and majority leader (2015–21). In 2024 he announced that he would be stepping down as minority leader later that year. During his early childhood, McConnell was afflicted with, but eventually overcame, polio. His family moved from Alabama to Louisville, Kentucky, when he was 13. He graduated from the University of Louisville in 1964 and from the University of Kentucky Law School in 1967. From 1968 to 1970 McConnell was a legislative assistant to U.S. Sen. Marlow Cook. He later served as deputy assistant U.S. attorney general in the administration of Pres. Gerald R. Ford (1974–75) and as judge/executive (chief judge) of Jefferson county, Kentucky (1978–85). McConnell was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1984, becoming the first Republican since 1968 to win a statewide election in Kentucky. As chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee in 1995, he garnered national attention for resisting Democratic attempts to investigate sexual assault accusations against Republican Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon. In a speech on the Senate floor, McConnell threatened to launch investigations into Democratic politicians who had faced similar charges in the past, among them Sen. Ted Kennedy. His Democratic colleagues prevailed, however, and McConnell publicly changed his mind about Packwood, who resigned later that year under the weight of evidence against him. McConnell earned a reputation as a tough opponent of campaign finance reform and campaign spending limits. From the 1990s he consistently voted against a series of such measures, including some sponsored by fellow Republicans. When a popular bipartisan measure sponsored by Republican Sen. John McCain and Democratic Sen. Russell D. Feingold was signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2002, McConnell promptly sued the Federal Election Commission, calling the law a violation of free speech. In a December 2003 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law. In subsequent years McConnell showed greater willingness to compromise. In 2005 he served on a bipartisan Senate committee that made recommendations for broad changes to the Department of Homeland Security, the government agency charged with protecting the country against terrorist attacks in the wake of the September 11 attacks of 2001. The following year he introduced a compromise bill that brought the Republican and Democratic parties closer to agreement about which interrogation techniques could be used by U.S. authorities on detainees held as suspected terrorists or terrorist sympathizers. In 2007, however, as the newly elected Senate minority leader, McConnell opposed Democratic calls to set in place a timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (see Iraq War), arguing that it was not within the power of Congress to make such a judgment. Following the 2008 election of Pres. Barack Obama, McConnell coordinated the Republicans’ efforts in the Senate, opposing (unsuccessfully) Democratic legislation to reform health care and the financial sector. The Republicans made significant gains in the 2010 midterm elections, and much of their initial focus turned to the federal deficit. In May 2011 McConnell joined other Republicans in announcing that he would not vote to raise the national debt ceiling unless various programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, underwent spending cuts. Without an increase to the debt limit, the government faced defaulting on its public debt. McConnell became a key figure in drafting a bipartisan deal that included significant cuts but no changes to the various entitlement programs. In addition, tax increases, which McConnell and the Republicans opposed, were also absent. Over the next several years, McConnell helped block a number of Democrat-led initiatives, including gun-control measures and increases to the minimum wage. Although some criticized his party’s use of the filibuster, he argued that Democrats refused to negotiate. After the Republicans regained control of the Senate in the 2014 midterm elections, McConnell was named majority leader. In 2016 McConnell caused controversy when he refused to bring Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, to a vote in the Senate. McConnell claimed that because it was an election year, the vacancy should remain open until a new president was inaugurated. During the 2016 presidential race, he supported the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, who was eventually elected. One of Trump’s first acts as president was to nominate Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. In April 2017 McConnell oversaw a change to the Senate rules that did away with the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees, and Gorsuch was confirmed by a vote of 54–45. Under McConnell the Senate approved numerous other Trump judicial nominees, including two other Supreme Court justices, Brett Kavanaugh (2018) and Amy Coney Barrett (2020). Both confirmations were contentious, with Barrett’s being particularly controversial as it came in an election year. The majority leader also backed various policies supported by the president, perhaps most notably a massive tax-reform bill that was passed in 2017. In September 2019 the U.S. House of Representatives launched an impeachment inquiry against Trump following allegations that he had extorted a foreign country to investigate Joe Biden, his political rival (in 2020 Biden became the Democratic presidential nominee). Three months later the House convicted the president on two charges: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. While McConnell stated that he would hold a trial, he attracted controversy when he announced that he was coordinating with the White House about the proceedings. The trial opened in January 2020, and McConnell was credited with keeping the Republicans unified, especially in defeating a motion to call witnesses. In February the Senate easily acquitted the president. Shortly thereafter schools and businesses began closing across the country because of the coronavirus pandemic, and the economy entered a downturn that rivaled the Great Depression. In late March McConnell oversaw the Senate’s approval of a relief bill that was later signed into law. The 2020 election was held in November amid this health crisis, and Biden defeated Trump; the fate of the Senate remained uncertain as both of Georgia’s senatorial races moved to runoffs. Trump contested the presidential election results, alleging voter fraud despite a lack of evidence. McConnell refused to push back against Trump’s claims and did not acknowledge Biden’s win until mid-December. That development came as McConnell attempted to halt a growing effort among Republicans to overturn the election. On January 5, 2021, both Democratic candidates won in Georgia, creating a 50–50 tie in the Senate; however, with an incoming Democratic vice president as the tiebreaker, Republicans became the minority party. The next day Congress convened to certify Biden’s victory, and McConnell—who remained majority leader, awaiting the swearing in of the new senators from Georgia—gave an impassioned speech against overturning the results, stating that to do so would send the country’s democracy into a “death spiral.” Shortly thereafter the proceedings were halted as Trump supporters stormed the Capitol. It took several hours to secure the building, but the certification eventually took place. Many accused Trump of encouraging the attack—McConnell later said the president “provoked” it—and on January 13, 2021, the House impeached Trump for a second time, charging him with “incitement of insurrection.” At the time, the Senate was in recess, and McConnell refused to reconvene early to hold the impeachment trial. Instead, senators returned on January 19, and McConnell became minority leader on January 20, the same day Trump left office. On February 9 the Senate trial began, and McConnell later voted to acquit Trump, arguing that they had “no power to convict and disqualify a former officeholder who is now a private citizen”; Trump was ultimately acquitted. However, McConnell subsequently claimed that the former president was “practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day.” From 1968 to 1980 McConnell was married to Sherrill Redmon, with whom he had three children. He later wed (1993) Elaine Chao, who subsequently served as secretary of labor under Pres. George W. Bush and secretary of transportation under Pres. Donald Trump.",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. MILWAUKEE (AP) Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 37 points, Damian Lillard had nine of his 28 in the final minute and the Milwaukee Bucks returned to the NBA Cup semifinals in Las Vegas by beating the Orlando Magic 114-109 on Tuesday night. Milwaukee reached the semifinals of the in-season tournament in Las Vegas last December and will be the only returning team in Year 2. They will play Saturday against the winner of Wednesday’s quarterfinal between the New York Knicks and Atlanta Hawks. Jalen Suggs led a short-handed Orlando team with 32 points but missed a potential go-ahead 3-pointer with 12 seconds left. Lillard was fouled and sank two free throws with 9.1 seconds remaining and Suggs missed a potential tying 3. Antetokounmpo then made both free throws with 5 seconds left and the Bucks held on. The Magic were missing forwards Paolo Banchero (torn right oblique), Jonathan Isaac (right hamstring strain) and Franz Wagner, who suffered a torn right oblique on Friday against Philadelphia; along with guard Gary Harris (left hamstring strain). Magic: Orlando’s bench scored 28 points in the first half, including 13 by Moritz Wagner and 10 from Anthony Black. But Wagner did not score in the second half. Bucks: Bobby Portis helped the Bucks erase an early 11-point deficit as he hit his first seven shots and scored 16 points in the first half. He finished with 22 points and 10 rebounds. Bucks forward Khris Middleton registered three consecutive assists - the first two on passes to Antetokounmpo and the third to set up a 3-pointer by Gary Trent Jr - as the Bucks took a 78-70 lead as part of an 11-0 Milwaukee run. Middleton did not score but had eight assists. Antetokounmpo extended his streak to 22 straight games with 20 or more points on 50% shooting, the longest streak to open a season in league history and the third-longest at any point in a season (Shaquille O’Neal and Zion Williamson, both 25 games). Antetokounmpo was 15 of 24 from the field. The Magic will play New York or Atlanta on Sunday. Copyright 2024 STATS LLC and Associated Press.

                "title": "Magic's narrow NBA Cup loss to Bucks shows they will be a tough out when the real tournament begins - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. MILWAUKEE -- The Orlando Magic won't be going to Las Vegas. Their NBA Cup journey came to an end in the quarterfinals on Tuesday night with a 114-109 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks. In defeat, though, they showed everyone -- themselves, the Bucks, the general NBA-watching public -- that they will be a problem when the real tournament, the NBA postseason, begins this spring. \"We want them to understand what they just did, just from an effort category, from going toe-to-toe with two Hall of Famers and a very experienced basketball team,\" Magic coach Jamahl Mosley said. \"I can't be more proud of their effort, their energy, their sticking together throughout the runs within the game that shows continued growth for this team. And understanding how good we can continue to be.\" Fresh off their first playoff appearance since 2020, the Magic's 2024-25 season got off to a frustrating start when star forward Paolo Banchero tore his right oblique just days after putting up a career-high 50 points, 13 rebounds and nine assists in a win over the Indiana Pacers. Without him, and facing a difficult schedule, they skidded to a 3-6 start. Then, Franz Wagner put the team on his back. The former lottery pick answered every question that was asked about him in the wake of his poor showing in the playoffs. He had 37 points and a game-winning 3-pointer against the Los Angeles Lakers and surged to the forefront of Most Improved Player discussions as he led the Magic on a 12-1 surge. And then, in a cruel twist of fate, he tore his own right oblique on Dec. 6. There's still no definitive timeline for Banchero's return, and Wagner is out indefinitely. But if anyone thought the Magic were going to fade away in their stars' absence, think again. In two games without Banchero and Wagner, they've beaten the Phoenix Suns and taken the Bucks to the wire. \"Jamahl sticks out, just what he's done. He's done a better job than everybody in the league to this point, especially when you factor in the injuries,\" Bucks coach Doc Rivers said. \"Their length, their size, they're very aggressive, they're strong, they play hard and they play connected defense. You can see it, they're really connected on defense. They don't take any plays off. That's why they win games when guys are out. They play the same way defensively, and if you're not ready to deal with that, you're gonna lose.\" The Bucks nearly learned that lesson on Tuesday. On the very first possession, Jalen Suggs snuck into the paint to smack the ball away from Giannis Antetokounmpo. The next time down, he arrived from the baseline for a block on the two-time MVP. That set the tone for a tough, physical contest that tested the Bucks from start to finish. The Bucks only spent a few minutes leading by more than five points, and needed some late-game heroics from Damian Lillard to pull out the win. \"For me as a competitor, I enjoy the competition part of it,\" Lillard said of the Magic's style. \"It forces you to have to be a little bit sharper, it forces you to have to be more engaged. Any little bit of slippage or lack of embracing what they bring is gonna end up hurting your team.\" The Magic may not have the shot-making they need right now without Banchero or Wagner, but their hard-nosed, defensive-minded approach never wavers. Their 106.1 defensive rating ranks third in the league, as does their opponent turnover percentage of 17.6%. They're second in defensive rebound rate (73.4%), second in blocks per game (6.7), third in steals (12.1) and fourth in deflections (18.1). For a team that doesn't get much national attention -- the Magic ranked 20th out of 30 teams with just five national TV games coming into the season -- Tuesday night's marquee NBA Cup matchup on TNT was an unexpected chance to show the world what they're all about. \"We feel like we got some of the best talent in the league, some of the most depth,\" Magic guard Anthony Black said. \"Definitely always good playing in front of some eyes, that way our guys are getting the credit they deserve.\" Even after Tuesday's defeat, which counted as a regular-season game, the Magic remain in third place in the Eastern Conference at 17-10. Where they will be when Banchero and Wagner return to the lineup remains to be seen, but it's clear this is a playoff team. Once that time comes, whether they're healthy or not, no team is going to want to line up across from the Magic. \"They're tough, they play hard, they play physical, they crash the offensive glass, they do things together and they're well-coached,\" Lillard said. \"We knew coming in that this was gonna be a tough game regardless of who was out there because of that. \"You just gotta give them their respect.\" © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

                "content": "MILWAUKEE: Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard showed out against the Orlando Magic, leading the Milwaukee Bucks to securing a semi-final spot in the NBA Cup. Giannis scored 27 points on a great efficiency of 62.5 per cent, hitting 15 of his 24 shots. Lillard was similarly impressive, scoring 28 points on a 53.3 per cent clip, hitting 8 of his 15 shots. Orlando would take an early lead in the first and extend it further early in the second as Moritz Wagner hit a jump shot from beyond the arc, putting the Magic up by 11. He would score six more points in the first two minutes. But, Bobby Portis would stop the Magic from pulling too far ahead, as scoring seven points of his own in the early moments of the frame. Portis would hit two jump shots later in the second to level the score at 47 each, before Lillard would drive into the paint and score a lay-up to put the Bucks up by two. However, the Magic’s Jalen Suggs, who ended the game with an incredible 32 points, would hit turnaround fadeaway and a three-point jump shot not long after, to regain the lead. Giannis would then take things into his own hands. He would score 10 points in the last 3:30 seconds, with the last bucket being an alley-oop dunk that Lillard assisted on. The Bucks would end the quarter leading by one. Thunder secures spot in NBA Cup semi-finals as Shai scores 39 A jump shot from Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, a layup from Goga Bitadze, and a three pointer from Suggs, would put Orlando back up by six early in the third. But, the Bucks would end the quarter ahead by eight, thanks to 12 points in the quarter from Giannis. The fourth quarter would be hotly contested. With less than four minutes left in the quarter, the Bucks would lead by three Giannis casually dunked the ball. Suggs would then hit a deep three from the top of the key to level the score 100 each. The Magic’s leading scorer would hit two more shots, while Lillard and Giannis made a few three throws. With less than a minute left, Lillard would take over, hitting a three pointer from the left wing, followed by a driving dunk, and four free throws to help the Bucks close out the game, 114-109. The Milwaukee Bucks will now face the winner of Wednesday night’s matchup between the New York Knicks and the Atlanta Hawks. The Bucks have faced the Knicks just once this season on November 8. Milwaukee lost by 22 points, as both Giannis and Lillard struggled to keep up with Karl Anthony Towns, who scored 32 points. The Bucks also lost to the Hawks earlier this month by 15 points in a game that saw the two Milwaukee stars struggle to find any help from their supporting cast. Who is Roki Sasaki? MLB’s future star The Bucks will be in for a tough match no matter who they face, but they may prefer to play the Hawks who are currently below them at seventh in the eastern conference, while the Knicks sit at fourth.",
