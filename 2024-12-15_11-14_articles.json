                "content": "Saturday Night's Main Event is a series of American professional wrestling television specials produced by WWE (originally the World Wrestling Federation or WWF). It was originally broadcast by NBC from 1985 to 1992, replacing Saturday Night Live in its late night timeslot on an occasional basis throughout the year. At a time when weekly wrestling programs typically consisted primarily of squash matches featuring established stars dominating enhancement talent, Saturday Night's Main Event consisted almost entirely of star vs. star matches rarely seen on television, including title defenses and specialty matches. It coincided with and contributed to the apogee of the \"second golden age\" of professional wrestling in the United States; bolstered by regular in-ring appearances by WWF stars such as Hulk Hogan, Saturday Night's Main Event drew large audiences for much of its run, while a spin-off simply titled The Main Event aired annually on a Friday night in February beginning in 1988. Ratings began to fall in the 1990s, leading to NBC dropping the specials in 1991. In 1992, the WWF moved Saturday Night's Main Event to Fox, which aired two editions of the special on the network before being discontinued. In 2006, Saturday Night's Main Event was briefly revived as a series of prime time specials on NBC, as part of WWE's agreement with NBC Universal to air its weekly program Raw on USA Network. Five episodes aired as part of the revived run before it was discontinued in 2008. In April 2022, WWE repurposed the Saturday Night's Main Event title for house shows held on Saturday nights.[1] In September 2024, as part of an agreement moving WWE SmackDown from Fox to USA, WWE announced that it would revive Saturday Night's Main Event on NBC once again. Saturday Night's Main Event debuted on May 11, 1985, in the late-night time slot normally assigned to reruns of the NBC sketch comedy Saturday Night Live. Then-SNL executive producer Dick Ebersol had made a deal with WWF owner Vince McMahon to produce the show, after Ebersol had seen the high ratings that two WWF specials drew on MTV in 1984–85: The Brawl to End It All and The War to Settle the Score.[2] Although the show aired infrequently, it did, starting in 1986, settle into a predictable pattern of airdates: New Year's weekend, an episode in late February/early March, an episode in late April/early May, an episode in late September/early October, and Thanksgiving weekend. 1989 and 1990 both offered episodes in July promoted as \"Summertime Bonus Editions\", some of the Superstars would come on The Arsenio Hall Show interviewed by Arsenio Hall himself to build up/hype of the event. Saturday Night's Main Event was a tremendous rating success for NBC during its heyday, most notably on the March 14, 1987, show, which drew an 11.6 rating, which to this day remains the highest rating any show has ever done in that time slot. That show was headlined by a battle royal involving Hulk Hogan and André the Giant, who were slated to face each other at WrestleMania III. As Hogan rarely wrestled on the WWF syndicated and cable television shows, Saturday Night's Main Event was the program on free television where most viewers were able to see him in action. The success of Saturday Night's Main Event led to several Friday night prime time specials, known as The Main Event. The first of these, on February 5, 1988, included a WrestleMania III rematch between Hogan and André and drew 33 million viewers and a 15.2 rating, which is still the highest-rated television show in American professional wrestling history. While ratings remained strong through 1990, they began to fall shortly thereafter. NBC, who had just acquired the rights to broadcast NBA games nationwide, now started to lose interest in wrestling, and Saturday Night's Main Event was dropped. Its final NBC airing occurred on April 27, 1991. Fox picked up the show in 1992, but it was only shown twice on Fox; on February 8, 1992, and the final Saturday Night's Main Event of the original run was broadcast on November 14, 1992. For much of its history, Saturday Night's Main Event was hosted by McMahon and Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura with the occasional use of Bobby Heenan in 1986 and 1987. In 1990, Roddy Piper replaced Ventura as McMahon's broadcast partner when Ventura left the WWF. On the two episodes that aired on Fox, Heenan served as McMahon's partner. From 1985 to 1988, the opening theme song for the NBC version was \"Obsession\" by Animotion with the closing theme being \"Take Me Home\" by Phil Collins, and also the beginning of \"Take On Me\" by a-ha was used for show bumpers. Steve Winwood's \"Higher Love\" was also used as a closing theme. Starting on the October 4, 1986 edition, each show featured a cold open of short wrestler promos set to a loop of the beginning of Lee Ritenour's \"Traveling Music\" from the American Flyers soundtrack.[3] In February 1988, the songs were replaced with an original WWF-created instrumental theme. The new instrumental theme was originally used as the theme of the 1987 WWF Slammy Awards. A different opening theme song was used for the February 1992 episode. Selected episodes were also shown in the UK on ITV in its weekly Saturday lunchtime World Of Sport slot, mainly thanks to the popularity of The British Bulldogs. When WWE's flagship show, Raw, returned to the USA Network in 2005, Saturday Night's Main Event was revived in 2006 as a \"special series\" to air on occasion on NBC as part of a deal between WWE and NBC Universal. The Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brand rosters appeared on the show. Saturday Night's Main Event returned to NBC on March 18, 2006, in a prime-time slot. The first episode aired on a 1-hour time delay, the second episode aired live, with the three remaining episodes airing at a later date. Since 2009, Saturday Night's Main Event was replaced instead with WrestleMania: The World Television Premiere. In 2024, after originally moving to Fox in 2019, WWE SmackDown moved to USA Network as part of a five-year agreement with NBCUniversal. As part of the agreement, it was stated that WWE would produce four prime time specials for NBC per-year for the length of the agreement. On September 17, 2024, WWE announced that it would premiere a second revival of Saturday Night's Main Event, with the first episode to air on December 14 from Nassau Coliseum.[4] The new revival features homages to the original run of Saturday Night's Main Event, including the reinstatement of \"Obsession\" by Animotion as its theme music.[5] The following table lists the dates and locations of televised events; they do not include the 2022 house shows.

Following the match, Andre the Giant sneak-attacked Hogan and choked him to the brink of unconsciousness, fighting off several wrestlers who came to aid Hogan; this served as one of the build-ups to the Hogan-Andre match on The Main Event, which aired February 5, 1988.

                "content": "Watch CBS News By Jose Fabian Updated on: December 14, 2024 / 3:57 PM PST / CBS San Francisco San Francisco residents were woken up by a tornado warning early Saturday morning during a powerful storm system that battered the region with heavy rain and wind. It was the first-ever tornado warning for San Francisco, but not the first tornado, cited CBS News Bay Area meteorologist Paul Heggen. The National Weather Service issued the warning for northern San Mateo County and parts of downtown San Francisco, just before 6 a.m. until 6:15 a.m. According to the NWS, there was a cyclonic signature on the radar that had produced enough rotation signature to prompt the warning. 📡Radar Update [9:40 AM] - Impressive cyclonic signature on radar moving across North Bay right now. This larger scale feature is what helped provide enough forcing to produce the rotation signature prompting the tornado warning @ 5:51 AM. **TORNADO THREAT HAS ENDED** #CAwx pic.twitter.com/GzHUh06F1V \"The radar scan at 5:52am clearly shows a \"hook echo\" offshore — that's the signature we look for to identify a developing tornado. This feature was embedded within a broad area of very heavy rain, but it still stands out,\" Heggen explained. Notice the cloud-to-ground (well, cloud-to-ocean) lightning strike near the hook echo. That confirms the instability present in the atmosphere — such strikes are only possible with enough vertical motion to separate charged particles (\"hydrometeors\") within the storm. 4/15 pic.twitter.com/NY3RSewd6j The NWS Bay Area said the warning was over for San Francisco at 6:07 a.m. And let the tornado warning expire at 6:15 a.m. The warning led to a flurry of social media posts from residents who were woken up by the alert on their cell phones. It was being reported as the first-ever tornado warning issued for San Francisco. There was also a special alert issued for a possible water spout on San Francisco Bay in the area of the Bay Bridge that expired ten minutes after the tornado warning. Special Marine Warning including the San Pablo Bay, Suisun Bay and the West Delta and the San Francisco Bay north of the Bay Bridge until 6:30 AM PST pic.twitter.com/5sATFgWa0K While the strongest part of the system has passed, isolated severe thunderstorms remain possible for parts of the Bay Area through the morning, the National Weather Service said. According to PG&E, the storm conditions caused power outages for thousands of people in the Bay Area. The tornado warning in San Francisco was just the first of multiple extreme wind events connected to the powerful storm that passed through Northern California overnight and continued to cause problems Saturday. High winds were causing impacts across the region, including a city-wide power outage in the North Bay city of Novato and a full closure of Interstate 580 in both directions at the San Joaquin and Alameda county line after a multiple-vehicle collision involving a big rig due to high winds. On Saturday afternoon, a tornado touched down in the Santa Cruz County town of Scotts Valley. Police had initially issued an alert regarding a multi-vehicle accident, but later reported that witnesses said a tornado had touched down on Mount Hermon Drive, throwing \"multiple cars off the road.\" The Bay Area office of the National Weather Service later confirmed that a tornado had occurred based on \"video, photos, firsthand accounts, and radar signatures\" Jose Fabian is a web producer for CBS Bay Area where he reports on local crime, politics and breaking news.

                "content": "Manage your account A tornado warning has been issued for the first time ever in San Francisco, as thunderstorms swept through the region, toppling trees and causing major power cuts. The advisory was issued just before 06:00 local time (14:00 GMT) on Saturday for northern San Mateo County and parts of downtown San Francisco. The storm caused power outages for more than 221,000 people across Northern and Central California, according to the PowerOutage website. The city last saw a tornado in 2005, though that struck without any clear radar signature, so no warning was issued in that case, National Weather Service (NWS) meteorologist Roger Glass told AP news agency. More than one million residents were woken on Saturday morning in San Francisco and its suburbs to alerts on their mobile phones, warning them to \"take shelter now\". Winds of up to 60mph (96km/h) ripped through the area, the NWS said. But a few minutes later, NWS Bay Area said the warning was over and the storm had moved out of the city's downtown. Authorities were assessing the damage to determine if a twister had occurred. Nearby San Mateo County was last issued a tornado warning in 2011. NWS Bay Area warned that residents should still steer clear of the seaside over the weekend, with a coastal flood advisory in place until Monday. San Francisco's tornado alert came just a week after the city saw its first ever tsunami warning The brief advisory was issued for northern California and southern Oregon following a magnitude 7.0 earthquake that hit off the northern coast of the state. It was later rescinded, and no injuries were reported. Tsunami warning cancelled after magnitude 7 earthquake strikes California coast",

Winds light and variable. Updated: December 14, 2024 @ 6:59 pm LOS ANGELES — A first-ever tornado warning was issued for San Francisco County early Saturday as thunderstorms and wind gusts of up to 80 mph swept through the region, officials said. \"Take shelter now in a basement or an interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building,\" a National Weather Service advisory said on social media. Parts of San Mateo County were also included. More than 1 million people were under the brief warning, which went out at 5:51 a.m. and was lifted by 6:15 a.m., said Lamont Bain, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service Bay Area. The advisory was the first time the agency had ever issued a tornado warning for San Francisco County, he said. San Mateo County was last issued a tornado warning on March 18, 2011. \"It's certainly unusual. We don't see the ingredients come together all the time for tornadoes,\" Bain said. In addition to moisture, \"you need the combination of lift, you need some instability and you need some wind shear. We saw all of those things come together for a brief period of time this morning.\" He said the tornado alert was \"a good reminder for people to always have multiple means\" to receive weather and warning information. That includes signing up for text alerts, checking news reports and tuning in to weather radio. Rain showers are forecast for the rest of the day in San Francisco, with wind gusts of 30 to 35 miles per hour through at least noon. The rain was expected to end Saturday night, with dry conditions on Sunday before another dose of rain on Monday. Power outages were widespread as a result of the storm, which began Friday. PG&E said wind gusts of 95 mph were recorded in Humboldt County on Friday evening. San Francisco International Airport experienced 83-mph winds early Saturday. PG&E said its crews were working to repair the damage and that power had been restored to more than 95,000 people by 10:45 a.m. Saturday. ©2024 Los Angeles Times. Visit latimes.com.

                "content": "Liverpool's Diogo Jota bagged a last-gasp equaliser to snatch a 2-2 Premier League draw for the 10-man Reds in a breathless encounter at Anfield on Saturday, with Arne Slot's hosts twice roaring back from a goal down. Liverpool remain top of the table on 36 points, five ahead of Chelsea, who host Brentford on Sunday, and six in front of Arsenal, who were held to a 0-0 home draw by Everton and have played a game more. Fulham are ninth on 24 points. Andreas Pereira put Fulham ahead in the 11th minute with an acrobatic volley from Antonee Robinson's cross which bounced off Liverpool full back Andy Robertson's thigh and into the net past goalkeeper Alisson. On a tough afternoon for Robertson, he was shown a red card six minutes later for a lunging tackle on Harry Wilson that officials determined denied an obvious goalscoring opportunity. Cody Gakpo levelled two minutes after the break with a diving header from Mohamed Salah's sumptuous cross but Rodrigo Muniz put Fulham in front again in the 76th when he bundled home Robinson's cross while crashing into Alisson. Liverpool continued to press and Jota, in his first game since being injured against Chelsea in October, slotted past Bernd Leno in the 86th minute as Liverpool avoided what would have been only a second loss for Slot in 23 games across all competitions. The Reds had several chances to net a winner in the dying minutes in front of an ear-splitting Anfield crowd, including a shot from Harvey Elliott that flew marginally wide and another from Luis Díaz that sailed just over the bar. There were also seven yellow cards shown in the game, a couple of which had the normally composed Slot waving his arms in anger. The Anfield faithful booed the officials at the end. \"I don't think I could've asked for more from my players, especially after going down to 10 men,\" Slot said. \"I couldn't have asked for more in terms of performance and results. \"At the start of the game, you always want to start intense. After 30 seconds, one of ours [Robertson] was on the floor and needed treatment for a while so we couldn't get the intensity.\" It was the team's first league game in 10 days after Storm Darragh caused the postponement of their Merseyside derby at Everton and their second successive league draw after a 3-3 result at Newcastle. \"A great comeback is very positive,\" Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk said. \"It's disappointing having 10 men but we showed fight, kept trying to create chances. Could have been more but we take the point and move on.\" Fulham manager Marco Silva added: \"When you are leading twice and, of course, Liverpool after 17 minutes playing with 10 men, we feel we should have won the game. \"When you come here to Anfield to play a game and to match them and try to win the game, that is going to be an electric game. It's a big emotional [feeling].\"",

The Liverpool left-back was given his early marching orders for a last-man foul on Harry Wilson just 16 minutes into the match, which left the Premier League leaders in an early hole. Twice Fulham would go in front, first through Andreas Pereira before the red card and again on a sensational finish from substitute Rodrigo Muniz with 14 minutes remaining. Both goals were assisted by American international Antonee Robinson who tacked on the best episode yet to his remarkable season with a Man of the Match performance. Yet both times Liverpool had an answer as Arne Slot pulled all the right levers. First it was Cody Gakpo shortly after the second-half restart, with the Dutchman having been brought into the XI in place of a struggling Darwin Nunez. On the backs of a tireless performance from midfielders Dominic Szoboszlai and Ryan Gravenberch, Liverpool remained lively despite the man disadvantage. Diogo Jota came off the bench for an emphatic return from injury as he scored with four minutes left in the 90 on a great finish after a feed from fellow substitute Nunez. Thanks to Arsenal's disappointing 0-0 draw with Everton, Liverpool won't rue their dropped points too much, especially given the nature of the draw itself. Yet if Chelsea win at home against Brentford tomorrow, the Blues could pull within two, although Liverpool still do hold a game in hand.

It's always disappointing for the leaders not to take the full three points, but having played over two-thirds of the game a man down, they'll certainly know it's in some ways a point gained. Both teams will feel they maybe should have won it, so in the end a draw is a fair result. 90+6 min: Chance, Fulham! This game is electric, end-to-end stuff at the finish! Adama Traore forces a big save from Alisson, and the Brazilian's parry falls to only a Liverpool player who can clear! 90+4 min: Chance, Liverpool! A HUGE BLOCK FROM ANTONEE ROBINSON! The American comes across to get a massive block on a wide-open Virgil van Dijk shot right on the penalty spot! He surely would have scored if not for the last-ditch challenge! 90+2 min: There's a long stoppage as Alex Iwobi blocks a shot from Harvey Elliott in a...very painful area. Ouchhhhh. He takes forever to get up, understandably, but the Anfield faithful have no sympathy. 88th min: Darwin Nunez is shown a yellow card for fouling Sasa Lukic late, which seems harsh as he got the ball and then his foot bounced off onto the ankle of Lukic. A whopping NINE minutes of stoppage time are shown. 86th min: GOAL! LIVERPOOL! Diogo Jota is BACK and scores a huge equalizer for the hosts! He receives a vertical through-ball from Darwin Nunez and puts Fulham defender Jorge Cuenca into a blender before finishing past Bernd Leno who simply has to guess which way to dive and guesses wrong! After the goal, Marco Silva rushes Adama Traore onto the pitch as a substitute, replacing Harry Wilson. VIDEO: Watch Liverpool goal in USA | Watch in Canada 83rd min: Liverpool have an attacking third free-kick as Sander Berge is booked for hauling down Darwin Nunez after the Uruguayan picked his pocket in the Fulham defensive third. He had to make the challenge after having given the ball away in a very dangerous area. The delivery comes to nothing as a glancing header from Nunez goes well wide of the far post. 82nd min: Chance, Liverpool! Former Fulham man Harvey Elliott sends a curler just inches wide of the top-left corner! 76th min: GOAL! FULHAM! YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING ME RODRIGO MUNIZ! THAT'S A TRULY RIDICULOUS GOAL! It comes from Antonee Robinson again on the left edge of the penalty area, and his cutback to the near post results in a crashing of bodies between Muniz, Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson and defender Joe Gomez. Somehow, incredibly, Muniz produces a truly unbelievable rainbow flick to fling the ball into the goal! What an incredible finish!! Alisson is injured on the turf in the aftermath, and needs attention, appearing to require a concussion test as he has a bit of a shiner on his right cheek. He's ok in the end. Arne Slot still makes a double change to bring on Harvey Elliott and Diogo Jota. VIDEO: Watch Fulham goal in USA | Watch in Canada 68th min: Darwin Nunez is set to enter the match for Liverpool His name is chanted by the Anfield crowd as he will come on alongside Jarrell Quansah. Cody Gakpo is replaced, which is a surprise, but it's not shocking that Curtis Jones goes off too, given he took a Sasa Lukic shot straight to the ankle earlier and appeared to be limping in the aftermath. So too will Emile Smith Rowe and Rodrigo Muniz enter for Fulham, replacing Andreas Pereira and Raul Jimenez. 65th min: Chance, Liverpool! The Reds nearly score for a second time today off a counter-attack directly following a Fulham corner. Mo Salah can't quite put his tight-angle shot on target an a feed from the brilliant Dominic Szoboszlai! The Hungarian has been senational! 63rd min: Fulham have efforted to quiet the crowd a bit as Liverpool were building more and more momentum, and they've done so by trying to hold the ball a bit more. They even generate a pair of half-chances, the best of which came to Harry Wilson who just couldn't quite reach a ball in front. Alex Iwobi also flashes a cross through the danger area but nobody is there to apply the finish. 57th min: A yellow card is shown to Curtis Jones for a poor foul on Alex Iwobi. It's right in front of Arne Slot, who is incensed, and himself picks up a booking as well. That will result in a touchline ban for Slot who triggers an accumulation suspension, and in truth it's a very silly one as the booking for Jones was quite an obvious one. 54th min: Kenny Tete is not able to carry on, despite having come back out onto the pitch. He's limping heavily and is sporting a huge welt to his left leg, and will be replaced by Timothy Castagne in a like-for-like swap. The absentee list gets even longer for Fulham at the back. 51st min: Joe Gomez and Kenny Tete are both on the ground after plowing into each other as Cody Gakpo gets a shot on goal. Tete was looking at the Dutchman and didn't see the Liverpool defender making a vertical run through the Fulham man, so no foul was rightly called, but it did leave both players in a heap on the pitch. Gakpo is furious and is protesting for a penalty, but in truth it's Gomez who came barreling through and pummeled the Fulham man. 47th min: GOAL! LIVERPOOL! The hosts are back level through Cody Gakpo!! He crashes home a diving header at the far post on a cross from that man Mo Salah!! Kenny Tete slipped and lost his mark! Now the awkward check from VAR, likely checking a potential foul by Luis Diaz dragging down Tete. It does indeed look like Diaz grabs hold of Tete's arm and pulls him down...but the goal stands! Fulham fans won't like it, but they're level and Anfield explodes! VIDEO: Watch Liverpool goal in USA | Watch in Canada 2nd half kickoff: They're back under way at Anfield, and there are no changes from either side. Fulham are a goal and a man up, but Liverpool looked better as the first half went on. HALFTIME: Liverpool 0-1 Fulham The halftime whistle blows with Fulham in front by a goal and a man at the break. In truth, however, it's the visitors who will be happy to see play brought to a halt, as they were on the back foot as the half wore on. Still, Andy Robertson has left his Premier League leaders in a poor position with a poor last-man challenge, and it will take a hard fight-back for Liverpool to draw back level. Fulham look lively in their own right, but need to be careful as they have three players on a yellow card including two defenders — the visitors were a little too juiced for this big game and have proven a bit rash and unnecessarily physical at times. 45th min: Six minutes of added time are shown, given the two lengthy delays plus the many yellow cards shown. A buzz reverberates around Anfield as Liverpool looked to have grown into the new game state more and more as the half went on, and are pushing for an equalizer before the break. 41st min: Chance, Liverpool! The Reds look a bit more organized and aggressive in the last 10 minutes, and they get forward down the right where Dominic Szoboszlai fizzes an excellent cross to the head of Luis Diaz, but it's just a hair off target and the Liverpool forward can't get the right contact. He contorts his body awkwardly just to reach it, but heads the ball over the crossbar. A good opportunity! 33rd min: Joe Gomez and Kenny Tete get into a physical battle on the touchline, and the referee decides not to show either player a yellow card, simply having a spirited chat with both. It's a bit of a surprise, given Gomez nearly went at Tete's head at the end of it out of frustration, but the official decides he's shown enough cards for now, that here more pragmatism is required. 31st min: Chance, Fulham! As Fulham break down the left flank, Joe Gomez jumps in to make a very important sliding block! It comes off a truly sensational back-heel assist from Andreas Pereira who leaves it to Harry Wilson, but Gomez comes flying in to prevent the shot from reaching Alisson's net! 27th min: Arne Slot has decided not to make a substitution to replace his red carded defender, sticking with the 10 players on the pitch for now. Antonee Robinson is shown a yellow for fouling Luis Diaz to halt a Liverpool counter off a Fulham corner that's claimed by Alisson and distributed immediately. The American is beaten down the left wing by a lovely Diaz flick and decides to body the Colombian to absorb the booking. 22nd min: Chance, Fulham! After a very long delay for the VAR review of the Andy Robertson red card, Harry Wilson finally has the free-kick from his foul, and it's SO close to curling inside the top-left corner! A delicious delivery that whizzes by the woodwork! 16th min: RED CARD, LIVERPOOL! ANDY ROBERTSON IS OFF! WHAT A TURN OF EVENTS AT ANFIELD! He's spilled Harry Wilson to the ground for a last-man challenge! Virgil van Dijk isn't square enough with the challenge to be a factor, and so Robertson is off! It's a bit controversial, because the referee plays advantage initially, with Raul Jimenez latching onto the loose ball and having a shot on goal, which is saved by Alisson. Thus, Liverpool believe it should only be a yellow card for \"stopping a promising attack\" instead of \"denying an obvious goal scoring opportunity\" and no free kick given. However, as ESPN rules analyst Dale Johnson explains, \"the chance belongs to the player, not the team when determining DOGSO.\" It's the right decision in the end for the situation, Robertson can have no complaints. There's a lengthy delay as VAR is checking to see if Harry Wilson is offside on the initial delivery, which would make all the difference in the play. It's an extremely tight decision, but van Dijk is playing Wilson on, and that's the Liverpool left-back gone! VIDEO: Watch Robertson red card in USA | Watch in Canada | Watch in Australia 11th min: GOAL! FULHAM! THE WHITES LEAD AT ANFIELD THROUGH ANDREAS PEREIRA! The Brazilian rewards his manager's faith with a truly brilliant strike, meeting an Antonee Robinson cross from near the left corner at the far post with a flying ninja kick! The ball clips off Andy Robertson and beats Allison between the goalkeeper and the woodwork! VIDEO: Watch Fulham goal in USA | Watch in Canada | Watch in Australia 9th min: Already a THIRD yellow card of the match now is shown to Andreas Pereira who rakes the back of Ryan Gravenberch's ankles in midfield, meaning the Brazilian will be suspended for Fulham's next league game thanks to an accumulation suspension, which comes on Boxing Day against Southampton. 7th min: Now a yellow card is shown to Luis Diaz as he attempts to produce a truly spectacular bicycle kick on a ball in from the left, but ends up almost kicking a Fulham defender in the head. 6th min: Nearly the same thing happens again as this time Luis Diaz is fouled outside the Fulham penalty area but is flagged for offside. Replay shows it's a very tight decision and may have been the wrong one. 1st min: There's already a lengthy stoppage in the first minute of play, as Andy Robertson is down receiving treatment and appears to be in major pain after taking the full brunt of an Issa Diop challenge, getting cleated right in the knee. Diop has been shown a yellow card for the challenge, which on review feels fair, but is also quite confusing because Robertson was flagged for offside so it shouldn't be an in-play situation worthy of a booking. Marco Silva is extremely unhappy, screaming at the fourth official, and he will know this is a very nervy situation now with so few center-back options already. It's a weird one, because in truth it's a bad enough challenge to warrant thoughts of a red, but Fulham know the offside flag should also nullify the event entirely. So the decision of a yellow card will baffle both sides. KICKOFF: \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" rings out across Anfield Stadium, and the ball is rolling for this Premier League match! Bernd Leno makes an impressive 90th consecutive Premier League start. 15 mins to kickoff: While they aren't quite fully fit yet to start and play 90 minutes, Diogo Jota and Federico Chiesa could both provide a welcome jolt of life to the Liverpool attack should they be needed off the bench today. Kickoff is right around the corner! One housekeeping note for Liverpool fans to keep in mind is that Ryan Gravenberch will be suspended when he receives his next booking, as he sits on four yellow cards on the season. Closing in on kick-off ⏳ #LIVFUL pic.twitter.com/rkmYXiHOi2 30 mins to kickoff: Liverpool have been excellent all season long, but especially at home where they have reestablished Anfield as a fortress. They have just one defeat in their last 12 home matches dating back to late last season, while all 11 other results ended in victory, an impressive recent record. Going further back, it's three defeats in their last 68 home games. 45 mins to kickoff: Fulham's 23 points have them 10th in the Premier League table, which represents their second-most points through the first 15 matches of a season in club history. What's incredible about that is they still have a few results which feel as though they were robbed of points late, such as the 3-2 defeat to Manchester City, 1-0 loss to Man United, or the 1-1 draw with West Ham. Had a few of those gone their way, they may have an even better standing in the battle for European places. Fulham have picked up 23 points in their first 15 Premier League matches this season (W6 D5 L4), their second most at this stage of a Premier League campaign, behind only 2003-04 when they had 25 points.[@OptaJoe]#LFC | #FFC | #LIVFUL pic.twitter.com/AHi2BB7lUg 1 hour to kickoff: Lineups are in, and there are more surprises from Fulham than Liverpool. For the hosts, indeed as we suspected may occur, Darwin Nunez drops out of the lineup with Cody Gakpo entering, moving Luis Diaz to the central striker position, although those two may overlap plenty during the game. They also get both Diogo Jota and Federico Chiesa back fit enough to make the bench. For Fulham, there are two interesting changes. Emile Smith Rowe and Adama Traore, who have both been position this season, are both on the bench, while Andreas Pereira and Harry Wilson start. Pereira has been poor overall this year, but gets a chance to star in a big game. Wilson, meanwhile, has been extremely effective off the bench but largely has played a backup role to Traore. 1 hour 15 mins to kick: The Liverpool lineup isn't the only one to provide clarity on squad narratives in 15 minutes. Fulham also have questions to answer involving Andreas Pereira, who's struggled this season providing just one goal contribution in Premier League action. While Emile Smith Rowe hasn't been brilliant, he has certainly been better in the No. 10 role than Pereira, who has seemingly now become redundant. He didn't help himself by conducting an interview over the November international break where he seemed to suggest he wanted a move to French side Marseille. Will the Brazilian see the XI from the start, or will he continue to serve as a substitute? \"Andreas is going to be back stronger\" 💪Fulham boss Marco Silva says Andreas Pereira's absence against Tottenham was not down to an interview where he appeared to suggest he wanted to join Marseille ⚪ pic.twitter.com/awTRXSpYIA 1 hour 30 mins to kick: It will be fascinating to see whether struggling Liverpool striker Darwin Nunez gets the start up front today or if he's plopped on the bench by Arne Slot. The Uruguayan was backed by his manager before the match, but his finishing has been exceedingly poor. Slot said he believes \"it is a matter of time before he starts to score,\" but also admitted that Nunez is \"in competition with\" both Luis Diaz and the injured Diogo Jota who is expected to return soon. “This is the challenge he also faces now.\" Who will get the start today? There's only room for two of Diaz, Nunez, and Cody Gakpo in the attacking unit alongside the ever-present Mohamed Salah. Liverpool head coach Arne Slot has defended Darwin Nunez despite the striker's struggles in front of goal.Full story: https://t.co/XRRgcuuU26 #BBCFootball pic.twitter.com/4H9YzPsr2C 1 hour 45 mins to kick: Today's match at Anfield will feature a minute's applause in the 19th minute for Liverpool supporter Zacharias Atkinson, a 19-year-old who was killed in an industrial accident on the Bootle docks on Wednesday. 2 hours to kickoff: Fulham left-back Antonee Robinson has arguably been not only one of the best left-backs in the Premier League but in the world over the past two years. Marco Silva called the 27-year-old \"a top player and great professional\" as well as a \"proper athlete\". Silva praised the improvement of his defensive capabilities without sacrificing his attacking contributions. \"He's improving season by season, week by week. We are really proud to have him with us.\" He'll have maybe his biggest challenge of the season to date matching up against Mohamed Salah — a massive test for the English-born USA international. Antonee Robinson has made more tackles and interceptions combined (73) than any other player in the Premier League this season. 💪 pic.twitter.com/530ddLb5j4 This Premier League match kicks off from Anfield Stadium on Saturday, December 14 at 3:00 p.m. local time in Liverpool, England. Here's how that time translates across some of the major territories around the globe: Liverpool are in pretty good shape given the fitness concerns plaguing other big European clubs at the moment. The only consistent starter missing due to injury is Ibrahima Konate, who is absent for a few weeks with a knee problem, while Alexis Mac Allister is suspended for yellow-card accumulation. Others who are unavailable would likely not have started anyways. Konstantinos Tsimikas is dealing with an ankle problem, while Conor Bradley has a hamstring concern as well. Federico Chiesa is a doubt due to illness. The tactical question for Slot here is whether to start struggling striker Darwin Nunez or move Luis Diaz to the middle. Either way, it seems likely that Cody Gakpo will enter the lineup in place of either forward. Liverpool starting lineup (4-3-3, right to left): Alisson (GK) — Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, Van Dijk, Robertson — Szoboszlai, Gravenberch, Jones — Salah, Diaz, Gakpo Liverpool subs (9): Kelleher (GK), Quansah, Nyoni, Endo, Morton, Elliott, Chiesa, Nunez, Jota. MORE: Premier League top scorer rankings | Latest La Liga top goal scorer list Fulham's depth has been completely sapped by injuries, and the roster is littered with absentees. Reiss Nelson will miss at least 10 weeks with a serious hamstring injury, leading to more time for Adama Traore amidst a revival campaign. Meanwhile, gritty midfielder Harrison Reed is out until the new year after knee surgery, and Joachim Andersen is a doubt with a calf problem. Combine those with the suspensions to Tom Cairney and Calvin Bassey, and Silva's side is exceedingly thin. It seems that Andreas Pereira, with just one Premier League goal contribution so far this season, has lost his place in the starting lineup. He started on the bench in each of Fulham's last three league games. Fulham starting lineup (4-2-3-1, right to left): Leno (GK) — Tete, Diop, Cuenca, Robinson — Berge, Lukic — Wilson, Pereira, Iwobi — Jimenez Fulham subs (9): Benda (GK), Sessegnon, Castagne, King, Smith Rowe, Godo, Traore, Vinicius, Muniz.

Report as ten-player Liverpool roared back twice to earn dramatic draw with Fulham; their lead at the top of the Premier League stands at six points, before second-placed Chelsea play on Sunday; Andy Robertson was sent off in the first half; Diogo Jota scored late leveller on injury return By Laura Hunter Saturday 14 December 2024 18:42, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Ten-player Liverpool dropped two precious points in their pursuit of a first Premier League title since 2019-20 after drawing 2-2 with Fulham in a frenetic, topsy-turvy 100 minutes at Anfield. In a game full of incident and intrigue, Fulham twice took the lead but were pegged back by a resurgent Liverpool, who played over 70 minutes with a player less after Andy Robertson saw red. It's only the second time the Premier League leaders, on a 19-game unbeaten run, have failed to win at home all season - they lost 1-0 to Nottingham Forest in October - and means the gap at the top of the table is five points instead of a possible seven, before second-placed Chelsea play on Sunday. Alex Iwobi found Antonee Robinson to tee up Andreas Pereira for the game's well-worked opener, and that was just the start of an eventful and chaotic first half, which saw Robertson sent off for denying a goalscoring opportunity when taking out Harry Wilson. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player VAR reviewed at length, and ratified on-field referee Tony Harrington's decision, also choosing not to intervene when Pereira's high and heavy challenge on Ryan Gravenberch only drew a yellow card. The fevered atmosphere then got the better of the usually-calm Arne Slot, whose remonstrations attracted the attention of a very busy Harrington, with the manager's third booking of the season ensuring he will serve a touchline ban at Tottenham next weekend. \"We all felt the referee was a bit nervous, maybe, we felt it,\" Virgil van Dijk said afterwards. \"We can't put the blame on the referee but it's part of the game.\" Stream the Premier League with NOW Watch Premier League highlights Live Premier League table Premier League fixtures Anfield felt aggrieved, and Liverpool desperately needed a lift. They got it through the relentless endeavour of Mo Salah, who teased a wonderful deep cross for Cody Gakpo to convert at the back post two minutes after the restart. But the measure and control which Slot so often demands was lacking, and the drama only intensified as a result. Iwobi, with a hand in the first goal, also played his part in Fulham's second, crossing for substitute Rodrigo Muniz to apply a deft touch that took the ball beyond Alisson. The final twist arrived late, and it came via Diogo Jota after an 11-match injury absence. Two of Arne Slot's second-half changes, Darwin Nunez and Jota, combined before the latter gave Bernd Leno the eyes and rolled the ball the other way. Liverpool stretch their lead at the top to five points, with neighbours Everton holding Arsenal to a goalless draw, before Chelsea host Brentford on Sunday. Liverpool: Alisson (6), Alexander-Arnold (6), Gomez (8), Van Dijk (7), Robertson (3), Gravenberch (8), Szoboszlai (7), Jones (5), Salah (7), Gakpo (6), Diaz (6). Subs: Quansah (6), Nunez (7), Elliot (6), Jota (7). Fulham: Leno (6), Robinson (8), Cuenca (7), Diop (5), Tete (6), Lukic (6), Berge (6), Wilson (7), Pereira (7), Iwobi (7), Jiminez (7).

Player of the Match: Ryan Gravenberch Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk: Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Liverpool manager Arne Slot: \"It's exactly the opposite of the Girona game, where I was pleased with the result but not the performance. I'm very very happy with the performance, couldn't ask for more. \"If you drop points at home to Fulham that isn't what you expect or want. Being two times a goal down, and so many things go against us, except for one thing, our players and our fans were outstanding. \"The team showed character, and that is what Robbo [Andy Robertson] showed. Nothing to blame on him, character to him to continue after quite a hard knock on his knee with two studs [by Issa Diop]. I felt, 'ok, let's see how this continues', and I think it was quite fast afterwards where he concedes the red. Unfortunately it led to a red card that was a deserved red card.\" Fulham manager Marco Silva: \"It's a mix of feelings. When you are leading the score twice, and they play with 10 men, we have the feeling we should have won the game. The way we started showed the trust on ourselves, massive respect to Liverpool's quality, but we came to try to match and win the game. \"It was a bit emotional, because with their quality and the crowd, in moments they can be unstoppable, but we took that risk. Our dynamic created a lot of problems for them always. \"We should have kept the ball better, and make them run more, but the way we planned the game created so many problems for Liverpool. In the end the power of Liverpool made an impact too.\" Correctly predict six scorelines for a chance to win £250,000 for free. Entries by 3pm Saturday. © 2024 Sky UK",

LAS VEGAS (AP) Giannis Antetokounmpo had 32 points and was an assist away from a triple-double, Damian Lillard added 25 and the Milwaukee Bucks beat the Atlanta Hawks 110-102 on Saturday to earn a spot in the NBA Cup championship game. Antetokounmpo finished with 14 rebounds, nine assists and four blocks for the Bucks, who improved to 11-1 all-time in NBA Cup games - the only loss coming in last year’s semifinals. Brook Lopez scored 16 for Milwaukee. Trae Young had 35 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds for the Hawks, who got 15 points and 10 rebounds from Jalen Johnson and 15 points from De’Andre Hunter. Hawks: Young drew 11 fouls in the game, a season-high. He drew 10 fouls in two other games this season; the Hawks won both of those. Since Young joined the NBA, he's drawn at least 10 fouls in a game 52 times. Every other Hawk, combined, in that span has done it once. Bucks: Antetokounmpo was brilliant, shooting 10 of 15 from the field and 12 of 18 from the foul line. And Bobby Portis provided his usual boost off the bench with 10 points and nine rebounds in 23 minutes. Antetokounmpo blocked an alley-oop dunk try by Capela at the rim with 2:35 left, preserving what was a five-point Bucks lead. Going back to last season, including playoffs, Milwaukee had lost 20 consecutive games when trailing entering the fourth quarter. The Bucks trailed 83-82 going into the fourth on Saturday. The Bucks will play either the Thunder or Rockets in Tuesday's championship game before returning to regular season play on Friday at the Cavaliers. The Hawks return to regular season play Thursday at the Spurs. --- AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA Copyright 2024 STATS LLC and Associated Press.

                "content": "NBA Advertisement live Updated 2h ago 71 New Updates Giannis Antetokounmpo finished one assist shy of a triple double as Milwaukee advances to next Tuesday's NBA Cup final! The 'Greek Freak' totaled 32 points, 14 rebounds, 9 assists and 4 blocks to lead the Bucks. Trae Young recorded 35 points and 10 assists for a double-double, while four Hawks teammates registered 10 or more points. The much-anticipated Inside the NBA outdoor free-throw shooting showdown between ESPN's Stephen A. Smith and TNT's Kenny Smith ended with Stephen A. going 3-of-5 and Kenny going 1-of-5. Then, Stephen A., Shaquille O'Neal and Charles Barkley air-balled a bunch of 3s. Some money is going to someone's charity, which is nice. Turns out shooting outside in a suit isn't as easy as it looks. Advertisement NEW YORK — There was a moment midway through the fourth quarter of Wednesday's game that embodied the Hawks' identity. Something glitched in the NBA code and the longtime NBA Cup loyalists witnessed a run of play that was as sloppy as it was spectacular. Atlanta's offensive system is a collection of concentric circles that revolve around Trae Young's gravity, but there also is a raw side that mimics the Knicks in a way. They can dominate the offensive glass to complement their full-bore offensive flow. They will loop around one another at full speed and get off a look with a shot quality rating of \"meh\" and then somehow clean up things. Even the cleanup needs a cleanup. Everybody has to do their chores to make the Hawks work. But when crunch time arrives, the Hawks can bring Jalen Johnson and Dyson Daniels in the mix to run small-small pick-and-rolls with Young. Teams such as the Knicks will show two players on Young, and that's when he threads the pass to his rolling teammate. The Hawks have done some of this in the past with their bigs, and last season Johnson showed he had the potential to thrive in this role. What makes them so dangerous now is that Johnson and Daniels can catch on the short roll and slow things down, giving them time to manipulate the help defense until someone is open. \"We’re catching in the pocket and playing four-on-three and making the right decision,\" Daniels said. \"For me, it’s about me and the big playing one-on-two. If he steps up, then I have the lob. If the guy pulls in from the corner, then I have the kick-out. I've been in that position a lot of times this year, so I'm starting to get used to it.\" Read more here. GO FURTHER After rough start, Trae Young and the red-hot Hawks are rolling through the NBA Cup The Hawks' turnaround couldn’t have come at a better time because this franchise has looked mostly aimless since making the Eastern Conference finals in 2021. Entering Wednesday's NBA Cup showdown with a trip to Las Vegas and hundreds of thousands of dollars on the line for each player, the Hawks had won six of their last seven games with a couple of wins over the Cavaliers. The Knicks posed a big-time threat as the best offense in the league went against the worst 3-point defense. That’s not what ended up playing out, though. The Hawks (14-12) dominated the second half with defense and the combination of Trae Young and Jalen Johnson to book their trip to Sin City with a 108-100 win. The defense has been much improved during their hot eight-game stretch. Their physical style of defense, galvanized by Dyson Daniels, took form in a 34-18 third quarter for the Hawks, and they're looking like a team that can use this experience in the NBA Cup to get their act together. Going into last season, the Pacers were coming off a 36-46 season and looking to improve upon two disappointing seasons under Rick Carlisle. They were 10-8 when they encountered their chance to go to Vegas for the final four of the In-Season Tournament. They ended up getting to the final, and then continuing their good play to a 47-35 record and an appearance in the conference finals (can’t forget their Pascal Siakam trade helping). The Hawks went 35-47 last season, and took a 13-12 record into their quarterfinal game. Now, they have a chance to use this run to set themselves up for success the rest of the way.

Plus, Warriors-Rockets ends in controversy Stacy Revere / Getty Images LAS VEGAS — Bucks coach Doc Rivers was asked about Atlanta's Jalen Johnson, whose length on the perimeter has been a huge plus for the Hawks on defense. The comparison Doc made was, shall we, flattering: \"We play against it every day in practice,\" Rivers said. \"Yeah, Giannis (Antetokounmpo) that's what Giannis is in a lot of ways. I've watched Jalen -- he's really grown.\" GO FURTHER Jalen Johnson agrees to 5-year, $150 million extension with Hawks: How 22-year-old ‘fits our DNA’ Kyle Terada / Imagn LAS VEGAS — The Milwaukee Bucks are the only team that has advanced to Las Vegas in both seasons of the NBA Cup's existence. In last year's semifinals, the Bucks faced the upstart Indiana Pacers, who surprised teams around the league with one of the NBA's best offenses to start the season. Indiana beat the Bucks in Las Vegas behind a braggadocious effort from Tyrese Haliburton. While the Pacers surprised the Bucks in December, the whole league knew what to expect come playoff time. Still, the Pacers still bested the Bucks and Knicks on their way to an Eastern Conference finals appearance against the Boston Celtics. Bucks coach Doc Rivers believes the Pacers built the foundation for that run in Las Vegas. \"I look at last year, and I thought Indiana, do they make the Eastern finals if they don't have this tournament?\" Rivers said on Friday in Las Vegas. \"It gives you a free practice run in playoff situations. It's not the exact same. For us (this year), we got off to a rocky start, and now we're here. So I think this tournament can do a lot of different things for a lot of different teams. So I like it.\" While the Pacers were announcing their arrival on the scene, the Bucks are trying to remind everyone what they can do. The Bucks have not made it out of the second round in any of the three seasons since winning a championship in 2021, and have lost in the first round the last two postseasons. While they are now back over .500 after winning 11 of their last 14 games after a 2-8 start to this season, beating out three young teams and winning the NBA Cup could serve as a warning shot to the rest of the league about the potential of the old guys in Milwaukee. \"I like the tournament,\" Rivers said. \"I think it's really like a litmus test for the team.\" Benny Sieu / Imagn Khris Middleton will never be the most athletic player on the floor or blow people away with his ballhandling ability, but he will put his teammates in the right spots and intelligently manipulate defenders to create opportunities for himself and others. “He’s a big organizer,” Bobby Portis said. “He’s a big leader. He has a big-time voice that everyone respects. So when you play on the court with him, you can’t help but to be organized. “He’s gonna get you organized. He’s gonna call you out when you’re not doing your job. I think he came back at a great time to where now we can really trend in the right direction to see what works, what lineups work and things like that and just keep getting better day-by-day.” Against the Magic Monday, Middleton only attempted two shots. It was the first time in his career that he played at least 20 minutes in a game and did not score. Still, his teammates raved about how impactful he was because of how well he could read the game and make plays for others. Those reads weren’t just the correct swing of the ball to a teammate; he dished out eight assists on Tuesday. Seven of his eight helpers went to Giannis Antetokounmpo, and five of those seven ended up getting the two-time MVP a dunk. It is still early in his return, but the Bucks have scored 134.9 points per 100 possessions and allowed 115.7 points per 100 possessions with Middleton, which makes his lineups plus-19.2 points per 100 possessions in 63 minutes. Also, that success is occurring with Middleton really struggling as a scorer in his first three games, knocking down just 25 percent from the field and 28.6 percent from 3. Middleton has much to prove in his return, but the Bucks have been undeniably successful with him playing thus far. GO FURTHER Damian Lillard’s continuation, Khris Middleton’s connections: What we’re seeing with the Bucks Advertisement Stacy Revere / Getty Images LAS VEGAS — The Milwaukee Bucks have already met the Atlanta Hawks once this season, and it resulted in a 119-104 loss that snapped a seven-game win streak on Dec. 4. After the game, head coach Doc Rivers called the team's performance \"dead-legged\" and told reporters that he believed his team \"didn't think well\" in the loss. \"It's just one game, so we won't overdo it,\" Rivers said. \"We'll watch a little film. This is one that, my guess is, I won't watch a lot of film. I’ll start getting ready for (the next game against) Boston.\" When asked Friday afternoon about their dead-legged game against the Hawks, Bucks forward Bobby Portis cited the team's emotional win over the Detroit Pistons that ironically clinched the Bucks' spot in the quarterfinals of the NBA Cup and put them in position to beat the Orlando Magic and thus play the Hawks for a second time this season. This time around, the Bucks know they need to be significantly better in the categories they can control. In the Dec. 4 loss to the Hawks, the Bucks committed 18 turnovers. They allowed Atlanta to grab 16 offensive rebounds, which led to 21 extra points for the Hawks. Atlanta scored 30 fast-break points and 64 points in the paint overall, as the Bucks regularly failed to get back in transition and allowed the Hawks to repeatedly cut behind their defense in halfcourt settings. Hawks point guard Trae Young went 0-of-9 from 3 and had a quiet night overall with 17 points and 7 assists, yet the Bucks were still thoroughly outplayed. If their post-game comments are to be believed, the Bucks will cut many of those simple mistakes out of their performance on Saturday and play a much tighter game against Atlanta this time around. If those mistakes persist though, the Bucks are well aware of how the Hawks will make them pay. Getty Images Do they have a history against each other? The Bucks eliminated the Hawks in the Eastern Conference finals back in 2021. The Bucks went on to win the title, and it was the last time the Hawks were relevant until this week. They’re also the last two franchises to fire Mike Budenholzer. And Doc has now played for Atlanta and coached in Milwaukee. What’s the season series? The Hawks are 1-0 against the Bucks this season, beating them 119-104 on Dec. 4 in Milwaukee. Jalen Johnson led them with 23 points, 13 rebounds and five assists. Atlanta’s bench had 50 points on. Giannis had 31 points and 11 rebounds, while Lillard dropped 25. Nobody else for Milwaukee could really get going. What are their odds to win the whole thing? Bucks are at +240 to win the NBA Cup. Hawks are at +500 to win the NBA Cup. What’s the key matchup? Jalen Johnson versus Giannis Antetokounmpo. We know that nobody really stops Giannis, especially when he’s scoring in the paint like MVP Shaquille O’Neal. But Johnson has done a great job of being a scorer, a floor-stretcher, a facilitator and a defensive presence. He’s exactly what the Hawks wanted John Collins to become, and he still has so much room to grow. Antetokounmpo has a history of going against guys this size and reminding them how much stronger he is. What’s the key stat? 15. The Bucks are 10-4 when they make 15 3-pointers in a game, and they’re just 3-7 when they don’t. That’s especially meaningful because the Hawks allow one of the highest 3-point percentages in the NBA this season. Any key injuries? None for Milwaukee. None for Atlanta. Gut feeling about this one? Everything tells me that the Bucks should win this game and send the Hawks home. But their matchups against Indiana said the same thing a year ago, and the Pacers beat them. The Hawks have been difficult to take seriously over the years, but this defensive turnaround does seem to have some teeth to it. Prediction: Let’s get weird. Give me the Hawks. Getty Images How’d they do in group play? 4-0, plus-50 point differential. Did they win a tough group? Sort of! They went undefeated (as you can see, unless you scrolled right past the previous question to read this) in the group, and secured the victory on the last night of group play when they beat the Detroit Pistons. This group should have been tougher with Indiana and Miami in it. I also think this Toronto team is better than its record. Is this meaningful for them? It needs to be, and I think it is. The Bucks went to Vegas last year before getting hammered by the Pacers. Now, the Bucks are the only team to make it to Vegas again. Doc Rivers needs to get this team to a championship level by April, so extracting any extra competitive fire to harness in something like the NBA Cup could have a very good effect focusing them. How’d they make it to Vegas? The Bucks nearly lost to an Orlando Magic team that was missing its two best players, Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner. But Damian Lillard flashed that Dame Time ability, and Giannis Antetokounmpo came up with some massive plays to secure the 114-109 victory. Khris Middleton had some great passing, and Bobby Portis was a good scorer, both off the bench. Getty Images How’d they do in group play? 3-1, plus-15 point differential. Did they win a tough group? Absolutely. The Boston Celtics and Cleveland Cavaliers were in East Group C, and Atlanta beat them both. Sure, the Hawks also had the Washington Wizards and Chicago Bulls in the group, but losing to Chicago isn’t a bad thing this season. They Bulls are scrappy. And the good news is they didn’t lose to the Wizards a third time when they played (yes, they’re 1-2 against Washington this season). Is this meaningful for them? It is and should be. The Hawks have struggled with being competitive and progressing as a team since they made the 2021 Eastern Conference finals. While the NBA Cup is still new, it does add a bit of edge to some of these games, and we’ve seen that with their play so far. The Hawks are 7-1 in their last eight games and starting to flash the consistency of a team to be feared. Continuing that over into the NBA Cup could have the same effect as we saw with the Indiana Pacers last season. How’d they make it to Vegas? They faced the New York Knicks in Madison Square Garden and used a 34-18 third quarter to take control. Their defense was intense in the second half of that game, and we saw Trae Young get diabolical with how he carved up the Knicks’ defense in the 108-100 win. We also saw Jalen Johnson and De’Andre Hunter make massive players, which has been the staple of this eight-game stretch. Getty Images The Atlanta Hawks finished 3-1 in NBA Cup group stage, finishing first in the East's Group C. In the quarterfinals, the Hawks went on a 27-8 run in the third quarter to take control and upset the New York Knicks 108-100. Trae Young scored 22 points and dished out 11 assists, while DeAndre' Hunter and Jalen Johnson combined for 45 points. Advertisement Getty Images The Milwaukee Bucks went undefeated (4-0) in the NBA Cup group stage. They finished atop Group A and were the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference during the knockout rounds. In the quarterfinals, the Bucks held on to beat the Orlando Magic 114-109. Giannis Antetokounmpo had a team-high 37 points, while Damian Lillard (28) and Bobby Portis Jr. (22) had double-digit scoring. The Bucks shot 54.5 percent from the floor as a team and made 11 3-pointers. Through five NBA Cup games, the Bucks' average margin of victory is 11 points. Getty Images The stage is set. The Houston Rockets are the fourth team, alongside the Atlanta Hawks, Oklahoma City Thunder and Milwaukee Bucks, to advance to the NBA Cup semifinals, beating the Golden State Warriors, 91-90, on Wednesday night. A day earlier, the Thunder knocked off the Dallas Mavericks, 118-104, while the Bucks topped the Orlando Magic, 114-109. The semifinals will take place Saturday in Las Vegas.

Here are the NBA's estimated prize pool winnings for players in this year's tournament: Such winnings might not register with the NBA’s highest earners on maximum contracts — Stephen Curry made a league-high $51.9 million last season — but it could boost the fortunes of rookies signed to minimum contracts ($1,157,153 per player) and especially those on two-way contracts ($578,577), whose salaries would almost be doubled with the prize. Several max-contract players have spoken publicly about the added winnings for their less-highly-paid teammates providing extra motivation for them to win the NBA Cup. Advertisement The NBA Cup is an annual in-season competition the league created last year (when it was simply known as the In-Season Tournament) to gin up interest in the beginning of the NBA calendar. Four of the early games on each team's regular-season schedule were marked as NBA Cup contests, meaning they count towards teams' regular-season records and their status in the Cup. The 30 teams are divided into six groups of five, with three groups for each conference). The winners of the six groups, along with the best second-place team in Cup games in each conference, advance to a single-elimination eight-team tournament. The winners of the four quarterfinal contests then travel to Las Vegas to contest the semifinals and final, with the winner earning the NBA Cup and a prize of just over half a million dollars per player. All games except for the final also count toward each team's regular-season record. Each team enters the season with only 80 of their 82 regular-season games accounted for. The 22 teams that fail to advance will be reassigned their two remaining regular-season games during the week of the knockout round, while the quarterfinal losers in each conference will face each other to fill out their schedules. Here's a more detailed explanation of the format. GO FURTHER What to know about NBA Cup 2024: Format, start dates, favorites and more",

                "content": "Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks are headed to the NBA Cup championship game. The Houston Rockets and Oklahoma City Thunder are now figuring out who will join them. In the Western side of the bracket, the Thunder overcame the Dallas Mavericks and Luka Dončić in a 14-point win on Tuesday, while the Rockets won a controversial matchup against the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday that saw Steve Kerr calling out the refs after a one-point loss. It is a matchup of two of the NBA's youngest teams, and should be a good one in Las Vegas. The Bucks beat Trae Young and the Atlanta Hawks 110-102 in the semifinals of the 2024 NBA Cup on Saturday afternoon at T-Mobile Arena. That officially put them into the title game, where they’ll take on either the Oklahoma City Thunder or Houston Rockets on Tuesday night. Antetokounmpo finished just shy of a triple-double with 32 points, 14 rebounds and nine assists in the win. He shot 10-of-15 from the field, too. Damian Lillard wasn’t far behind with 25 points, seven assists and six rebounds, though he went just 5-of-14 from behind the arc. Young did everything possible to keep the Hawks in it in the third quarter after a tight opening half in Las Vegas. He shot 6-of-7 from the field in the period and put the Hawks in the lead entering the final period. Finally, though, Antetokounmpo and the Bucks surged ahead down the stretch. They mounted a quick 7-1 run late in the fourth quarter, powered by three short buckets from Antetokounmpo, to finally separate from the Hawks. Antetokounmpo sealed the deal in the final minutes, too, with a wild block on Clint Capela at the rim to break up an alley-oop. WHAT. A.

He finished with 35 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds for Atlanta, which dropped to 14-13 on the season with the loss. Jalen Johnson finished with 15 points and 10 rebounds, and De’Andre Hunter added 15 points and seven rebounds off the bench. Which team will join the Bucks and make it to Tuesday's NBA Cup championship game? Houston Rockets vs. Oklahoma City Thunder Time: 8:30 p.m. ET Channel: ABC Follow along with Yahoo Sports for live updates, highlights and more below: Hartenstein tipped in a bucket for the Thunder, and the third quarter is officially underway. We'll see if the offense picks up across the board here soon. Amen Thompson leads all scorers with 13 points off the Rockets’ bench, and SGA has 12 points to lead the Thunder. He’s shot 3-of-12 from the field. Both teams have combined for six 3-pointers, and neither team is shooting better than 33%. This is also the fewest points that the Thunder have put up in a half all season. SGA is still struggling to get anything to fall. He just missed a layup, but drew a pretty weak foul to get to the line. He then split his free throws. It’s a rough night for him. He’s just 1-of-9 from the field now with seven points.

                "content": "The Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball program is the men's college basketball team of the University of Kentucky. It has eight NCAA championships, the best all-time winning percentage, and the most all-time victories.[2] The Wildcats compete in the Southeastern Conference and are coached by Mark Pope.[3] Adolph Rupp first brought Kentucky to national prominence, winning four NCAA titles. Since then, Joe B. Hall, Rick Pitino, Tubby Smith, and John Calipari each won a national championship, making Kentucky the only school with five coaches to win NCAA championships and placing it second only to UCLA for most titles. Kentucky has finished as the NCAA runner-up four times, making it tied with UCLA and North Carolina for all-time title game appearances at 12. The program has played in 17 NCAA Final Fours, tying Duke for third-all time behind North Carolina and UCLA. Kentucky leads all schools in several NCAA tournament stats: Elite Eight appearances at 38, Sweet Sixteen appearances at 45, total NCAA tournament appearances at 60, and tournament games played at 184. The program is behind only North Carolina with 131 NCAA tournament wins, North Carolina has 132. Kentucky has also won the National Invitation Tournament twice, making it the only school to win multiple NCAA and NIT championships, and it leads all schools in total postseason appearances at 68. Additionally, the Helms Athletic Foundation declared Kentucky the 1933 and 1954 national champions, the latter being Kentucky's only undefeated team in the modern era (post-1930). The 1948 NCAA champion team, coached by Rupp, represented the United States in the Olympics and won a gold medal. Kentucky was the first program to 1000 wins in 1968 and the first to 2000 wins in 2009. The program leads all schools with sixty-three 20-win seasons, sixteen 30-win seasons, and six 35-win seasons. Additionally, Kentucky is second among all teams in conference regular season championships with 53. Throughout its history, the Kentucky basketball program has featured many notable and successful players, both on the collegiate level and the professional level. Five players have been named national player of the year, with Anthony Davis in 2012 and Oscar Tshiebwe in 2022 being consensus selections. Three players have been named national freshman of the year: John Wall in 2010, Davis in 2012, and Reed Sheppard in 2024. Thirty-nine players have been selected as All-Americans a total of 51 times. Kentucky holds the record for the most overall NBA Draft selections (128) and three Wildcats have been selected as the first overall pick (Wall, Davis, and Karl-Anthony Towns). Thirty-nine players have been honored with jersey retirements, as well as Rupp, Hall, Pitino, Smith, equipment manager Bill Keightly, and broadcaster Cawood Ledford. Seven players have been enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame, as well as Rupp, Pitino, Calipari, Eddie Sutton, and Ledford. During Kentucky's earliest seasons the program went through multiple coaches, with the majority staying only one or two seasons. Records indicate that the first head coach of the Wildcats was W. W. H. Mustaine, who in 1903 called together some students, took up a collection totaling $3 for a ball, and told the students to start playing.[4] The first recorded intercollegiate game at the college was a 15–6 defeat to nearby Georgetown College. The team went 1–2 for their first \"season\", also losing to Kentucky University (later Transylvania University) but defeating the Lexington YMCA.[5] Through 1908, the team did not manage a winning season, and had an all-time record of 15–29. In the fall of that year a full-time head coach was hired, Edwin Sweetland. This made him the first paid coach in Kentucky's basketball history.[6] That year, the team went 5–4, and only three years later, boasted their first undefeated season with nine victories and no losses.[7] The 1914 team under Alpha Brummage, led by brothers Karl and Tom Zerfoss, went 12–2 and defeated all its Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association opponents. In 1919, George Buchheit became the new head coach of the Wildcats. An alumnus of the University of Illinois, he brought with him a new system of basketball. The \"Buchheit system\" or \"Illinois system\", focused on defense and featured one player standing under each basket, while three roamed the court. Bucheit varied the system he learned in Illinois in one important way. While the Illinois system employed a zone defense, Buchheit's system used an aggressive man-to-man scheme. On offense, he used a complicated system of passing called the \"zig-zag\" or \"figure eight\" offense.[8] Although the team had a losing season in Buchheit's first year, they won the first-ever Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association tournament the next year, defeating the heavily favored Georgia Bulldogs. Both of these teams were composed entirely of native Kentuckians, anchored by All-American Basil Hayden. The tournament victory was considered Kentucky's first major success, and the 1921 team became known as the \"Wonder Team.\"[9] In 1922, the team was unable to build on the success of the \"Wonder Team.\" Although every player was eligible in 1922, two key players, Hayden and Sam Ridgeway, were injured before the start of the season. Hayden returned from his knee injury during the season, but was never able to play at the level he had the previous year. Ridgeway fought a year-long battle with diphtheria, and although he recovered, never played for the Wildcats again. The remaining three members of the \"Wonder Team\" went 9–5 for the season, and bowed out of the SIAA tournament in the second round.[10] Buchheit remained as coach through the 1924 season before moving on to coach Trinity College (later Duke University). A different coach would guide the team for each of the next four years. C.O. Applegran immediately followed Buchheit, and his 1925 team posted a respectable 13–8 record. Applegran in college had played for the University of Illinois, where he became an All-American. The next year, Ray Eklund led the team to a 15–3 record, and produced UK's second All-American, Burgess Carey.[11] The record was enough for Kentucky to win their first regular season conference championship in the Southern Conference. Seeing the cupboard largely bare for the upcoming year, Eklund resigned shortly before the start of the 1927 season. The team scrambled to find a new coach, and former player Basil Hayden left his coaching job at Kentucky Wesleyan College to answer the call. An inexperienced coach and a roster largely depleted of talent left the Wildcats with a 3–13 record that year. The disappointment convinced Hayden that he wasn't the \"coaching type\", and he resigned after the season. Fortunately for the Wildcats, 1927 would be their last losing season for six decades.[12] The Wildcats' new coach for the 1927–28 season was John Mauer. Although he had a talented group of players moving up from the junior varsity team, Mauer quickly discovered that his players did not know the fundamentals of the game. He began a regimen of three-hour practices five days a week during the preseason. The practice began with half an hour of shooting drills and usually ended with a full-court scrimmage. Between the two, Mauer worked on skill drills and scenarios. Mauer's teams were nicknamed the \"Mauermen.\"[13] Teamwork was the hallmark of Mauer's system. Every player worked on every aspect of the game; there were no specialists. Like Buchheit, Mauer employed a strong man-to-man defense. He utilized a slow-break offense that relied on a complicated system of short passes to get a good shot. Two elements of Mauer's system were new to basketball in the south – the offensive screen and the bounce pass. The latter was so new to most of UK's opponents that it was referred to as the \"submarine attack.\"[14] Over his three-year tenure, Mauer led the Wildcats to an overall record of 40–14. One major prize eluded him, however. Despite having teams that were almost universally acknowledged as the \"class of the South\", Mauer never led a team to the Southern Conference title. Despite his innate ability for coaching, Mauer lacked the ability to heighten his team's emotions for a big game, a fault that was cited as the reason for his lack of tournament success. Mauer left the Wildcats to coach the Miami University Redskins following the 1930 season.[15] In 1930, the university hired Adolph Rupp, who had played as a reserve for the University of Kansas 1922 and 1923 Helms National Championship teams,[16] under coach Forest C. \"Phog\" Allen. At the time of his hiring, Rupp was a high school coach in Freeport, Illinois.[4] Rupp coached the University of Kentucky men's basketball team from 1930 to 1972. There, he gained the nicknames, \"Baron of the Bluegrass\", and \"The Man in the Brown Suit\". Rupp, who was an early innovator of the fast break and set offense, gained a reputation as an intense competitor, a strict motivator, and strategist. Rupp's Wildcat teams won 4 NCAA championships (1948, 1949, 1951, 1958), one NIT title in 1946, appeared in 20 NCAA tournaments, had 6 NCAA Final Four appearances, captured 27 Southeastern Conference (SEC) regular season titles, and won 13 SEC tournaments. Rupp's Kentucky teams also finished ranked No. 1 on 6 occasions in the final Associated Press college basketball poll and 4 times in the United Press International (Coaches) poll. In addition, Rupp's 1966 Kentucky squad (nicknamed \"Rupp's Runts\", as no starting player on the squad was taller than 6'5\") finished runner-up in the NCAA tournament, and his 1947 Wildcats finished runner-up in the NIT. Rupp's 1933 and 1954 Kentucky squads were also awarded the Helms National Championship, and his 1934 and 1947 teams were retroactively recognized as the national champion by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.[17][18][19][20] Rupp gave the '44 team the nickname \"the Beardless Wonders\" and \"Wildkittens\" because according to Rupp, \"It was like running a Kindergarten\".[citation needed] Of the young players, Kentucky's best player was freshman Chad Anderson who, at the age of 17, was named consensus All-American, making him the youngest player to ever earn the title. The Beardless Wonders won 19 of their 21 games, enough to be invited into the NIT. There they were matched up with a Utah team nicknamed the \"Blitz Kids\".[citation needed] Both teams went into the half tied at 24, but with the help of Brannum Kentucky pulled away to win 46–38. Kentucky lost the next game to home town Saint John's.[citation needed] On the way to its first NCAA title, Kentucky went on to a record of 36–3. Of these three losses, all were either away or at neutral sites, keeping Kentucky undefeated at home throughout the entire season. Kentucky started off the beginning of the season with a 7–0 record heading into their away game at Temple. However, Temple was able to give the Cats their first loss by one point, 60–59. But the Wildcats rolled off an 11-win streak before playing at Notre Dame, where they lost 55–64. They did not lose a game for the rest of the regular season. Kentucky continued through the NCAA tournament to the finals, where they faced the Baylor Bears. Kentucky won its first NCAA title in a decisive 58–42 victory. The season did not end after the NCAA tournament, as Kentucky who would play in the Olympic Trials, where they went 2–1, only losing to the Phillips Oilers once. This was performance enough to represent the United States in the 1948 Olympic Games. Despite only being a college team, the starting 5 of Kentucky defeated all of its competition in London, making Kentucky the only team to win both an NCAA title and an Olympic gold medal.[citation needed] Adolph Rupp soon gave this team the nickname \"The Fabulous Five\", in honor of their accomplishments.[citation needed][21] For the 1949 season Kentucky had high expectations with most of the Fabulous Five returning. Big Blue Nation's expectations were met as the 1949 team won one more game than the previous year including both a SEC regular season and SEC tournament championship, while also getting back to the Final Four that March. In the finals Kentucky faced the Oklahoma A&M Cowboys, a team that had previously seen success in the tournament with back-to-back championships in 1945 and 1946. The Fab Five would succeed again winning 46–36 and Kentucky's only back-to-back NCAA championship. Kentucky was the second program in NCAA history to win back-to-back championships (there have been six other schools since). With a returning star player like Bill Spivey, Kentucky hoped to carry their success into the new decade. The Wildcats lost their first game by 11 to Saint John's at home, but they would pull it together for the Sugar Bowl Tournament, which they won, beating NCAA runner-up Bradley. After losing to Tennessee, Kentucky struggled to chain two wins together, losing every other game. They defeated their next 14 opponents, including getting revenge in SEC tournament championship over Tennessee. Heading into the post-season, No. 3 Kentucky played CCNY in the NIT, missing the NCAA tournament. The Wildcats were no match and were thrashed by the CCNY Beavers, 50–83. Over the season Kentucky defeated four top 10 teams, and were ranked in the top 5 the entire season. Vanderbilt, however, knocked off the top ranked Wildcats in the SEC tournament finals denying them an eighth straight SEC tournament title. Kentucky then defeated fourth ranked Kansas State 68–58 in the NCAA finals, . Adolph Rupp was the head coach at Kentucky during the year of the point-shaving scandal of 1951. In 1945 former Kentucky football player Nick Englisis met Kentucky player Ralph Beard while the two played football at Kentucky. Englisis entered the gambling business when he left the football team in 1946, then approached three Kentucky basketball players Ralph Beard, Alex Groza, and Dale Barnstable with his associates in late 1948 about potentially point shaving (fixing the score of games) during the upcoming season in exchange for money. The three players agreed to point shave and successfully shaved points in several games during the 1948–1949 season until an effort to point shave caused the Wildcats to lose to the Loyola Ramblers in the National Invitation Tournament. Groza, Beard, and Barnstable attempted to win the game under the point spread but kept the score too close, allowing the Ramblers to win the game with an impressive performance at the end of the second half. Kentucky faced Villanova in their first game of the NCAA tournament following the loss to Loyola and the three players attempted to win over the point spread. When Groza, Beard, and Barnstable failed to win over the point spread, it caused Englisis to lose all of his money and ended the point shaving deals between Englisis and these three players.[22] On October 20, 1951, Alex Groza, Ralph Beard, and Dale Barnstable were arrested for taking bribes from gamblers to shave points during several games including the National Invitation Tournament game against the Loyola Ramblers in the 1948–49 season.[23][24] At the conclusion of this scandal, a subsequent NCAA investigation found that Kentucky had committed several rule violations, including giving illegal spending money to players on several occasions, and also allowing some ineligible athletes to compete.[24] As a result, the Southeastern Conference voted to ban Kentucky from competing for a year and the NCAA requested all other basketball-playing members not to schedule Kentucky, with eventually none doing so.[25] As a result of these actions, Kentucky was forced to cancel the entire 1952–53 basketball season. Years later, Walter Byers, the first executive director of the NCAA, unofficially referred to this punishment as the first de facto NCAA death penalty, despite the current rule first coming into effect in 1985, thus the NCAA having no such enforcement power previous to that.[26][27] Echoing Mr. Byers' view, the NCAA's official stance is very much the same, and they now state in hindsight, \"In effect, it was the Association's first death penalty, though its enforcement was binding only through constitutional language that required members to compete against only those schools that were compliant with NCAA rules. Despite fears that it would resist, Kentucky accepts the penalty and, in turn, gives the NCAA credibility to enforce its rules.\" [28] The team posted a perfect 25–0 record in the next year (Rupp's only undefeated season), for which it was awarded the 1954 Helms National Championship. In addition, Kentucky also finished ranked No. 1 in the final Associated Press poll. On the team were three players who had graduated at the conclusion of the previous academic year. When, at the last minute, the NCAA ruled these players ineligible from post-season play, Rupp decided to skip the 1954 NCAA Tournament in protest.[citation needed] The \"Fiddlin' Five\" team earned their name though playing around and mistakes, which Rupp described as fiddling. The Fiddlin' Five still has the most losses out of any Kentucky's championships, with six, three of those were in four games.[citation needed] Unlike the Fab Five or the 1951 teams, the Fiddling Five would yoyo in the rankings with their lowest a No. 13 coming after 56–57 loss to unranked Loyola Chicago. Kentucky improved through the tournament though, and won their fourth title over No. 18 Seattle in the confines of Louisville's Freedom Hall. Rupp's last Final Four team and one of his last chances at a 5th NCAA title occurred in the 1965–66 season, with Kentucky going all the way to the NCAA title game. The 1966 NCAA championship game against Texas Western (now University of Texas-El Paso or UTEP) marked the first occurrence that an all-white starting five (Kentucky) played an all-black starting five (Texas Western) in the NCAA championship game.[citation needed] Texas Western won the game 72–65, on the night of March 19, 1966. Kentucky entered the tournament with only one loss and ranked No. 1, Texas Western also had only one loss and entered the tournament ranked second. Kentucky was a 6.5 point favorite in the game[29] The game was depicted in the film Glory Road.[citation needed] This game, and the result of it, were especially significant as the game came at a time when the civil rights movement was coming into full swing around the country. In 1969, after actively recruiting black players for over six years (his first formal scholarship offer was to Wes Unseld in 1964), despite most of the other SEC teams threatening to boycott if a black player took the court), Rupp finally signed his first black player, Tom Payne, an athletic 7'-1\" center out of Louisville. This ended the aspect of all-white Kentucky teams forever, and marked a new era with many notable black Kentucky basketball legends, including Jack Givens, Sam Bowie, Kenny Walker, Jamal Mashburn, Tayshaun Prince, Rajon Rondo, John Wall, Anthony Davis, and Karl Anthony Towns.[30] The late Rupp years looked promising with Dan Issel's commitment to the Wildcats in 1966. Over the next four years Issel scored an average of 25.7 per game, adding up to 2,137 points in his college career. This made Issel the player with the most points to ever play at Kentucky, a feat that has not been matched to this day. This included his 53 points scored against Mississippi State in 1970, the most by a Kentucky player in a single game until Jodie Meeks made 54 against rival Tennessee on January 13, 2009. Issel did not capture the national championship in his college years, but would go on to make a name for himself in the ABA.[citation needed] After 1966 Rupp saw continued success, but the Final Four eluded him. The Wildcats ended with a 13–13 season and missed the tournament altogether in 1967, then reach the Elite Eight and Sweet Sixteen in the next two years. Ranked #1 in the nation with a 26–1 record overall, Kentucky nearly missed a Final Four berth in a 106–100 shootout against Jacksonville. [citation needed] Rupp was forced into retirement in March 1972, after reaching age 70. At the time, this was the mandatory retirement age for all University of Kentucky employees. He was a 5-time National Coach-of-the-Year award winner, a 7-time Conference Coach-of-the-Year award winner, and was elected a member of both the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and College Basketball Hall of Fame. Further, since 1972, the Adolph Rupp Trophy, considered one of the nation's premier basketball awards, has been given by Commonwealth Athletic Club to the nation's top men's college basketball player. In addition, the University of Kentucky retired a jersey in his honor in the rafters of Rupp Arena, a 23,500-seat arena named after him, dedicated in 1976.[17][18] Joe B. Hall was the head basketball coach at Kentucky from 1972 to 1985. Although he had been an assistant at Kentucky since 1965, Coach Hall was given a difficult task: to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor, Adolph Rupp. In the 1978 NCAA tournament, he coached the Wildcats to their fifth NCAA championship. He was named National Coach of the Year in 1978 and SEC Coach of the Year on four occasions. His record at UK was 297–100, and 373–156 over his career. Coach Hall won the title once in 1978, as well as making the final four in 1975 and 1984, and the elite eight in 1972, 1973, 1977, 1983.[citation needed] Coach Hall is one of only three men to both play on an NCAA championship team (1949– Kentucky) and coach an NCAA championship team (1978– Kentucky), and the only one to do so for the same school.[citation needed] The only others to achieve this feat are: After a year of playing in the freshman league and a disappointing sophomore season, Hall's Super Kittens returned with hopes of finally bringing Kentucky its fifth title. They nearly did just that, guiding Kentucky to a runner-up finish to UCLA in the 1975 NCAA tournament but not before avenging their 20-point defeat to an undefeated Indiana team. Despite losing in the championship game, it would give freshman Jack Givens a taste for success that would help propel Kentucky to the title three years later. It had been 20 years without a championship in Lexington, and along with pressure of following a hall of fame coach, Hall would nickname the 1978 season the \"Season Without Celebration.\" The pressure to win was immense on both players and coach to bring home the title, especially with a senior laden team that had gone to the finals as freshmen. Kentucky would hardly lose its composure all season or break under pressure, winning 30 of 32 games and defeating eight ranked teams along the way. By the time Kentucky reached the tournament finals they seemed bound to win the title, though Duke would give Kentucky their all. With the help of senior Jack \"Goose\" Givens' 41 points, Kentucky defeated the Blue Devils 94–88, and finally won their fifth title and first in 20 years. In 1985, Eddie Sutton succeeded Joe B. Hall. He coached the Wildcats for four years, leading them to the Elite Eight of the 1986 NCAA tournament. Two seasons later, Sutton and the 25–5 Wildcats captured their 37th SEC title and were ranked as the 6th college basketball team in the nation by the Associated Press and UPI[31][32] before losing to Villanova in the Tournament. Kentucky entered the 1988–89 season with a gutted roster. Ed Davender, Robert Lock and Winston Bennett had all graduated from school, while All-SEC sophomore Rex Chapman left school early to enter the 1988 NBA draft. Additionally, sophomore standout Eric Manuel was suspected of cheating on his college entrance exam and voluntarily agreed to sit out until the investigation was finished. Potential franchise recruit Shawn Kemp transferred out of Kentucky after signing with the school early that year.[33] Unfortunately, Manuel was forced to sit out the entire season as the investigation dragged on, essentially leaving the Wildcats in the hands of inexperienced sophomore LeRon Ellis and true freshman Chris Mills. The two underclassmen struggled to fill the talent vacuum on the court and the Wildcats finished with a losing record of 13–19, the team's first losing full-season record since 1927.[32] To add insult to injury, the NCAA announced at the end of the season that its investigation into the basketball program had found the school guilty of violating numerous NCAA policies.[34] The scandal broke when Emery Worldwide employees claimed to have discovered $1,000 in cash in an envelope Kentucky assistant coach Dwane Casey sent to Mills' father.[35] Later Emery settled a libel lawsuit filed by Casey for a substantial amount of money. Casey was not in Lexington when the envelope was supposedly mailed and the father of Mills said they received no money. The NCAA rescinded its show cause order immediately after the settlement of the lawsuit, and Casey's career has flourished as an NBA coach.[36] Another player, Eric Manuel, was alleged to have received improper assistance on his college entrance exams and was banned from NCAA competition. Whether Manuel was directly involved has been questioned.[37] Kentucky was already on probation stemming from allegations of an extensive scheme of payments to recruits, and the NCAA seriously considered hitting the Wildcats with the \"death penalty\", which would have shut down the entire basketball program (as opposed to simply being banned from postseason play) for up to two years. However, school president David Roselle forced Sutton and athletic director Cliff Hagan to resign. The Wildcats were slapped with three years' probation, a two-year ban from postseason play, the vacating of their two NCAA tournament wins in the 1988 season, and a ban from live television in 1989–90.[38][39] In 1989, Rick Pitino left the NBA's New York Knicks and became the coach at a Kentucky program reeling from the aforementioned scandal. Kentucky would be banned from the 1990 and 1991 post season, with the 1990 season suffering a 14–14 record. Kentucky would improve in 1991 with a beavy of home-grown upperclassmen such as Sean Woods, John Pelphrey, Richie Farmer, Deron Feldhaus, and Reggie Hanson along with the talented freshman Jamal Mashburn. Despite their record of 22–6, Kentucky was still banned from the post season and would have to wait another year to see the Unforgettables succeed in the tournament. Beginning with the 1992 season, Kentucky was free of post season bans. Though they lost one more game than last season, this team was most memorable for going to the Elite Eight (for the first time since Sutton's 1986 team) with many returning upperclassmen from Kentucky. The team is also known for playing in what could be considered one of the greatest games in NCAA tournament history against Duke. In this game defending champion Duke were looking to return to the Final Four once again, Kentucky for the first time in almost a decade. The game was hard-fought and physical on both sides all game including Laettner's infamous stomp on Aminu Timberlake, which resulted in a technical. The teams took the lead back and forth until the final minute of the game which resulted in a first buzzer beater shot by Kentucky's Sean Woods to take the lead 103–102, and then Laettner's shot to win the game for the Blue Devils in the final seconds 104–103. This team came to be known as the \"Unforgettables\" for helping put Kentucky back on the path to success in the 1990s and because the team was made up of home grown Kentucky kids. Kentucky returned a junior Mashburn, along with Travis Ford and Tony Delk. They were expected to reach the Final Four for the first time since Joe B. Hall's 1984 team. The expectations were right, as Kentucky would head into the post-season with only 2 losses and a No. 5 ranking. After winning the SEC Tournament once again, Kentucky stormed to the NCAA Final Four to meet up with Michigan's \"Fab Five\" a team of young and highly talented recruits that brought Michigan to the championship game the year before. As talented as Kentucky was they would fail to reach the championship game with a 78–81 overtime loss to the Wolverines. But this would be the just a glimpse of a run Kentucky would have later in the decade. Kentucky started the next season ranked #1 but would underachieve, falling short of the Elite Eight for the only time under Pitino. The highlight of the season was the \"Mardi Gras Miracle\", a game where Kentucky trailed LSU 68–37 with 15:34 left, but outscored them 62–27 over the remainder of regulation to win 99–95.[40] Starting in 1996, Kentucky would put together a string of Final Fours with help from 9 future NBA players. The \"Untouchables\" as they were nicknamed, would only lose twice, to Final Four bound UMass Minutemen (coached by former Kentucky coach John Calipari) and Mississippi State. It was with their overwhelming talent and chemistry that would win Kentucky their sixth national title in the 1996 NCAA tournament, Kentucky's first NCAA championship in 18 years. The following year, Pitino's Kentucky team made it back to the national title game, losing to Arizona in overtime in the finals of the 1997 NCAA tournament. Pitino's fast-paced teams at Kentucky were favorites of the school's fans. It was primarily at Kentucky where he implemented his signature style of full-court pressure defense. By the end of the Pitino era, Kentucky went from banned from the post season to going to three of the last five Final Fours and five of the last six Elite Eights. For this the 1997 team was dubbed the \"Unbelievables\" for taking a team that was not expected much of to return the Wildcats back to the championship game for a second time. Pitino left Kentucky in 1997 to coach the NBA's Boston Celtics, he then went on to coach Kentucky's in-state rival, the University of Louisville. Orlando \"Tubby\" Smith was introduced by UK Athletic Director C.M. Newton as the Wildcats' 20th head coach on May 12, 1997, charged with the unenviable task of replacing popular coach Rick Pitino. The Wildcats were at the top of the basketball world at the time, having won a national title in 1996 and, according to many, missing a second straight title in 1997 by the torn ACL of shooting guard Derek Anderson.[41] (Anderson tore his ACL in January against SEC foe Auburn; Kentucky lost the 1997 title game in overtime to the Arizona Wildcats.) The team Smith inherited sported seven players from the Arizona loss, and five from the 1996 championship team. However, since most of the players who had left after the 1996 and 1997 seasons were high NBA draft picks, his team had the lowest pre-season ranking since Kentucky came off probation in 1991.[42] In his first season at UK, he coached the Wildcats to their seventh NCAA championship, including a come-from-behind victory against Duke in the Elite Eight, and another comeback win against Stanford, then Utah in the Finals. His 1998 National Championship is unique in modern times, as being along with 1985 Villanova the 2nd team in over 20 years to win without a First Team All American or future NBA Lottery Pick (see 1998 NCAA tournament). The 1998 team was also unlike Kentucky's past two championship teams, often falling behind in games before roaring back to win rather than dominating their competition. Smith's teams, known primarily for a ball line defense-oriented slower style of play coined \"Tubbyball\", received mixed reviews among Kentucky fans who have historically enjoyed a faster, higher-scoring style of play under previous coaches. Smith was also under pressure from Kentucky fans to recruit better players. After leading Kentucky to one National Championship in 1998, Kentucky would complete a perfect 16–0 regular season conference record in 2003, win five SEC regular season championships (1998, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2005) and five SEC Tournament titles (1998, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2004). Smith led the Wildcats to six Sweet Sixteen appearances (1998, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005) and four Elite Eight appearances (1998, 1999, 2003, 2005) in his ten seasons. He totaled 100 wins quicker than any other Wildcat coach before him except Hall of Famer Adolph Rupp, reaching the plateau in 130 games (John Calipari subsequently broke this record in 114 games). In 2003, he was named AP College Coach of the Year. In 1998, the reserve guard J.P. Blevins scored 9 points, all on 3-pointers sparking the Wildcats to come back from a 15-point deficit in the first half to upset the number 5 seed, Michigan State 60–58. Averaging only 2.2 points a game all season, Blevins was the unlikely hero for the Wildcats who were 6–4, to give the Spartans who were 8-3 an unlikely upset. Especially since they fell behind 26–11 in the first half.[43] Although Smith compiled an impressive resume during his UK career, he came under considerable pressure from many UK fans, who believed that his failure to achieve even a single Final Four appearance in his last nine seasons was inadequate by UK standards. He was infamously dubbed \"Ten Loss Tubby\" by several disgruntled UK fans. Smith's Final Four drought is the longest of any coach in UK history,[44] although Smith did come just a double-overtime loss short of another Final Four appearance in 2005. On March 22, 2007, Smith resigned his position of UK Head Coach to accept the head coach position at the University of Minnesota.[45] On April 6, 2007, Billy Gillispie was formally announced as the new head coach of the University of Kentucky by UK athletic director Mitch Barnhart. He fielded questions from the media during the press conference held at UK's new practice facility, the Joe Craft Center. He expressed his excitement and joy to be not only considered for the position but to have been given the honor and the opportunity to coach what former UK coach Rick Pitino referred to as the \"Roman Empire\" of college basketball. \"I'm very, very grateful and honored to be here, but we have a lot of work to do.\"[46] Gillispie became only the sixth head coach in the last 76 years at the school.[47] Gillispie's second season again started out rocky in 2008 as the 'Cats fell to Virginia Military Institute in their season opener. The second game of the season saw the Wildcats fall to North Carolina by 19 points. UK rebounded to win 11 of their next 12 games, improving their record to 11–3. On January 4, the Wildcats lost a heart breaker to archrival Louisville 74–71 after a 25 ft. shot by Edgar Sosa with 2.3 seconds remaining in the game. Prior to the shot, UK was down 7 with 38.5 seconds left, and Jodie Meeks was fouled shooting a three, proceeded to make all three free throw shots, Patrick Patterson stole an inbound and passed it to Meeks who laid it in to bring the game to 71–69 with 29.6 left, and then an inbound pass went long and Meeks snatched the pass, drove to the hoop and was fouled, and then made both free throws to tie the game at 71 with 22.9 left. So all in all, UK and Meeks got seven points in about 15 seconds to tie the game.[48] Kentucky disposed of Vanderbilt to win their SEC opener on January 10, 70–60. On January 13, in a road game against Tennessee, Jodie Meeks set a new Kentucky scoring record by dropping 54 points on the Volunteers. This total bested Dan Issel's 39-year-old scoring record by 1 point, and propelled UK to a 90–72 win and 2–0 start in conference play.[49] Kentucky followed up this effort with a 68–45 victory at Georgia, improving to 14–4 on the season. With wins over Auburn and Alabama, Kentucky moved to 5–0 in the SEC. On January 26, UK was ranked in the AP Poll (24th) for the first time since week 1 of the 2007–08 season.[50] UK promptly dropped 3 in a row (to Ole Miss, South Carolina, and Mississippi State) before rebounding at home with a thrilling 68–65 win over Florida. Jodie Meeks scored 23 points in the contest, including the fade-away contested 3-point basket with less than 5 seconds remaining to seal the win for UK. On Valentine's Day Kentucky handily defeated Arkansas at Bud Walton Arena 79–63 behind another strong performance from Meeks. Meeks contributed 45 points and helped UK win despite the absence of Patrick Patterson (sprained ankle). With the win, UK remained tied with South Carolina and Tennessee for 1st in the SEC East at 7–3.[51] Following the win UK completely collapsed, losing 5 of its last 6 games to finish the regular season 19–12 with an 8–8 SEC record. Entering the SEC tournament many felt UK would need to win the championship game to get into the NCAA tournament, but UK was defeated in the second game vs. LSU. With an unimpressive regular season and quick elimination in the SEC tournament, UK did indeed miss the NCAA tournament for the first time in 18 years and instead received an invitation to the NIT tournament where the team was defeated in the quarterfinal round against Notre Dame.[52][53] On March 27, 2009, an 18-minute-long meeting occurred between Billy Gillispie, President Dr. Lee Todd, Jr. and Athletic Director Mitch Barnhart, after which it was announced that Gillispie would not be returning as the head coach the next season. Barnhart stressed the firing was due to more than wins and losses, citing \"philosophical differences\" and \"a clear gap in how the rules and responsibilities overseeing the program are viewed\".[54] On April 1, 2009, John Calipari replaced former head coach Billy Gillispie as the Wildcats head coach. To begin his tenure at the University of Kentucky, John Calipari signed one of the best all time recruiting classes.[55] The class was headlined by four five-star recruits: John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins, Daniel Orton, and Eric Bledsoe.[56] On December 19, 2009, the Wildcats defeated Austin Peay 90–69 extending their record to 11–0, and John Calipari broke Adolph Rupp's record for the most consecutive wins to start a season for a first-year head coach at Kentucky. Kentucky defeated the Drexel Dragons 88–44 on December 21, 2009, to become the first program in college basketball history to claim their 2000th victory.[57] By January 25, 2010, Coach \"Cal\" had the Kentucky Wildcats ranked No. 1 in both the ESPN/Coaches poll and AP poll with a record of 19–0.[58] Calipari helped raise in excess of $1.5 million to aid the country of Haiti during the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. President Barack Obama called the Wildcats to thank them for their relief efforts and wish them luck in their future endeavors. To finish off the 2009–10 regular season, Kentucky won its 44th SEC regular season championship (with a final 14–2 SEC record), and won its 26th SEC tournament championship, beating Mississippi State in the finals. The Wildcats then received a No. 1 seed (their 10th No. 1 seed in history) in the East Regional of the NCAA tournament, where they eventually lost to West Virginia in the Elite Eight. This also marked Kentucky's record 50th NCAA Tournament appearance. In 2011 the Wildcats got off to a good start in the regular season with a record of 12–2, with their only losses being North Carolina away and UConn in the Maui Invitational Finals. Conference play was a different matter, and Kentucky would struggle in the SEC losing 6 out of their 8 away games, all of one were against unranked opponents. To close out the season with a three-game defeat No. 13 Florida, No. 23 Vanderbilt and Tennessee at home for a 22–8 record. The hot streak would continue and Kentucky would win their 27th SEC Tournament Title. This was enough for No. 4 seed on the East regional where they played Princeton in a very close first-round game that ended in a 59–57 victory for the Cats. Knight, Jones and company would exact their revenge in the second round against West Virginia, who knocked off Kentucky in the 2010 tourney. In the Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight they would upset the No. 1 seed Ohio State Buckeyes and No. 2 seed North Carolina Tar Heels on their way to the school's 14th Final Four. They lost in the Final Four to eventual National Champion No. 3 seed UConn 56–55. In the 2011–12 season, Calipari led Kentucky to being 16–0 in SEC regular season play, clinching its 45th SEC regular season championship. The last team to do so in the SEC was the 2002–03 Kentucky Wildcats, and before that, the 1995–96 Kentucky Wildcats. Kentucky's regular season record was 30–1, with its only loss being by one point coming from a 3-pointer buzzer-beater by the Indiana Hoosiers' Christian Watford at Assembly Hall on December 10, 2011. In the SEC Tournament, Kentucky fell to Vanderbilt in the championship game, making its overall record 32–2 going into the NCAA tournament. Kentucky was both selected as the No. 1 seed in the South Region and also the No. 1 seed overall of the entire NCAA Tournament. The Sweet 16 match-up on March 23, 2012, was a rematch against Indiana, in which this time the Wildcats prevailed over the Hoosiers 102–90. On March 25, 2012, Kentucky won the South Regional, setting up a Final Four semifinal with the Louisville Cardinals. Calipari's Wildcats defeated the Cardinals (coached by former Kentucky coach Rick Pitino) by a score of 69–61. This sent Kentucky to the National Championship game against the Kansas Jayhawks, where they defeated Kansas 67–59, winning UK's 8th NCAA championship, along with John Calipari's first NCAA Championship as a head coach. This Kentucky team had a record six players drafted in the 2012 NBA draft, including the first time two teammates have been chosen with the first two picks: Anthony Davis (1st overall), Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (2nd), Terrence Jones (18th), Marquis Teague (29th), Doron Lamb (42nd) and Darius Miller (46th). The 2012–13 season's recruiting class ranked either first or second by various recruiting experts led by top center Nerlens Noel, guard Archie Goodwin, forward Alex Poythress, and four-star center Willie Cauley-Stein. Kentucky also brought in transfer guard Julius Mays, a graduate student who had previously played at Wright State University and North Carolina State. Mays was eligible to play immediately, because UK offered a master's degree program that Wright State did not. However, the only returner that saw significant minutes from the championship squad was back-up power forward Kyle Wiltjer, who averaged 11 minutes per game (Ryan Harrow sat out the previous season after transferring from NC State before the 2011–12 season). Although the team saw the rise of Jarrod Polson in the first game of the season against Maryland, they struggled to close out closer games and play with the will to win that Calipari demands. On February 12, Noel tore his ACL in a loss against Florida. UK was 17–7 including that game, and went 4–5 the remainder of the season, losing all 5 games away from Rupp Arena. The fourth of those losses was against Vanderbilt in the first round of the SEC tournament, and UK missed the NCAA tournament altogether, being the overall No. 1 seed of the NIT. UK was upset by Robert Morris in the first round of the NIT, ending their season with a 21–12 record. In the press conference following the loss to Robert Morris, Calipari stated that his 2013–14 team would be a \"tough, hard-nosed, fighting team.\" Noel and Goodwin both entered the NBA draft and were both taken in the first round at 6th and 29th, respectively. Ryan Harrow transferred to Georgia State to be closer to his father that had suffered from a stroke, and Kyle Wiltjer transferred to Gonzaga. Kentucky brought in the No. 1 recruiting class, featuring a record six McDonald's All-Americans in Julius Randle, Andrew Harrison, Aaron Harrison, James Young, Dakari Johnson, and Marcus Lee, as well as Kentucky natives Derek Willis and Dominique Hawkins, and walk-on E. J. Floreal (son of Edrick Floréal, head coach of UK's track and field team). Alex Poythress and Willie Cauley-Stein did not declare for the 2013 NBA draft, and decided to return for their sophomore seasons. In 2013–14, Kentucky looked to make up for its struggles in the previous season. Despite making the NIT, there were high expectations for this team. The team, however, would be without some of its top players from the 2012–13 team including Nerlens Noel[59] and starting shooting guard Archie Goodwin,[60] who were first-round draft choices in the 2013 NBA draft. Starting power forward Kyle Wiltjer transferred to Gonzaga[61] and starting point guard Ryan Harrow transferred to Georgia State.[62] Returning was former McDonald's All-American Alex Poythress and starting center Willie Cauley-Stein.[60] The poor success of the 2012–13 team did not stop John Calipari from again producing another number one recruiting class. The entering class included a record six McDonald's All-Americans[63] highlighted by Julius Randle and the Harrison Twins from Texas, Aaron and Andrew. Many recruiting analysts and experts proclaimed that the 2013 signing class was the greatest recruiting class since the infamous Fab Five in the 1990s.[64] The team began the season ranked number one in both the AP and Coaches polls.[65][66] The season was full of ups and downs. Early in the season the team experienced close losses to Baylor, Michigan State, and North Carolina. Despite those losses the team was able to defeat in-state rival Louisville. Nothing changed in SEC play for them either. The team ended the regular season losing three of their last four games including once to South Carolina, who finished the season 14–20 overall. The team limped into the SEC tournament unranked, and desperately looking for any answer to their disappointing season. Calipari during his weekly radio call-in show mentioned the team was given a \"tweak\".[67] The \"tweak\" sparked speculation and curiosity among the fans and the media to what it could be. The \"tweak\" was never fully revealed. However, the \"tweak\" caused the team to go on an historic run through both the SEC and NCAA tournaments. UK was the runner-up to number one Florida in the SEC Tournament. During the NCAA tournament UK became the first team in history to eliminate three teams from the previous Final Four (Wichita State, Louisville, Michigan). UK was the National Runner-up after losing to Connecticut in the national championship game. After the 2014 season, Kentucky only lost Julius Randle and James Young to the NBA draft.[68][69] The returning players consisted of a record-tying nine McDonald's All-Americans. Juniors Cauley-Stein and Poythress returned with sophomores Aaron and Andrew Harrison, Johnson, and Lee to join the No. 2 ranked 2015 recruiting class which was highlighted of Gatorade Player of the Year Karl-Anthony Towns for the 2015 season.[70] The team began its season in the Bahamas on a six-game tour against international clubs and teams.[71] While in the Bahamas the team established a \"platoon system\" which featured two groups of five players that would rotate every four minutes within the game.[72] The \"platoon system\" was put on display nationally in a 72–40 victory over No. 5 Kansas in the Champions Classic in November.[73] In December, the team defeated UCLA 83–44. Kentucky led 41–7 at halftime, the lowest UCLA point total for a half in its storied history.[74] The SEC regular season began with two overtime victories over Ole Miss and Texas A&M, the closest games Kentucky would play all season. Kentucky finished the regular season with a perfect 31–0 record, the best start in school history.[75] In the SEC tournament, the team won each game by double digits, including a 78–63 victory over Arkansas in the finals. Cauley-Stein was named the MVP of the Tournament. In the NCAA tournament Kentucky played its first two games at the KFC Yum! Center in Louisville. Prior to the regional semifinal against West Virginia, Mountaineers guard Daxter Miles proclaimed that Kentucky would be 36–1 after the game. The comment fueled the team as they defeated West Virginia 78–39, tying the largest margin of victory in the Sweet 16 in NCAA Tournament history.[76] In the regional final Kentucky narrowly defeated Notre Dame 68–66. The only loss of the season was in the Final Four to Wisconsin, who Kentucky defeated the previous season in the Final Four. The 2014–15 team tied the NCAA record for most wins in a season (38).[77] After the season Cauley-Stein and Towns were named consensus All-Americans among other awards received. The Kentucky Wildcats represented USA Basketball, at Globl Jam 2023, and defeated Canada to win the gold medal. Following a first round upset as a 2 seed in the 2024 NCAA Tournament, John Calipari resigned his position of Head Coach to accept the same role at the University of Arkansas. He was officially announced as the Razorbacks Head Coach on April 10, 2024, marking the end of his storied tenure at Kentucky. On April 12, 2024, Kentucky hired BYU head coach Mark Pope for the same position in Lexington,[78] days after Calipari left for the vacant head coaching post at Arkansas.[79] Pope was a member of the Wildcats' 1995-1996 team that won the NCAA Tournament. The Wildcats have had 23 coaches in their 112-year history. Mark Pope is the current head coach. Six Wildcats coaches have won the National Coach-of-the-Year award: Adolph Rupp in 1950, 1954, 1959, 1966, and 1970, Joe B. Hall in 1978, Eddie Sutton in 1986, Rick Pitino in 1990 and 1992, Tubby Smith in 1998, 2003, and 2005, and John Calipari in 2012 and 2015. Additionally, seven Wildcats coaches have been named Southeastern Conference Coach-of-the-Year: Adolph Rupp in 1964, 1966, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971 and 1972, Joe B. Hall in 1973, 1975, 1978 and 1983, Eddie Sutton in 1986, Rick Pitino in 1990, 1991 and 1996, Tubby Smith in 1998, 2003, and 2005, Billy Gillispie in 2008, and John Calipari in 2010, 2012, and 2015.[80] The following is a list of Kentucky's 8 National Championships: The NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition. The * represents overall number one seed which began with the 2004 Tournament. Kentucky has 42 men's basketball players, coaches, and contributors honored in Rupp Arena with banners representing their numbers hung from the rafters. Due to the number of players honored, the fact that several of them have shared numbers, the numbers are not officially retired. Some of the jersey numbers were before the NCAA rule change before the 1957–58 season that outlawed teams wearing jerseys with a number higher than 5 on it that was not changed until 2023.[81] To have a banner hung, the individual must be elected to the UK Athletics Hall of Fame.[82] The following Kentucky players, coaches, and contributors have been enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. The following Kentucky players and coaches have represented their country in basketball in the Summer Olympic Games: The Kentucky Wildcats presently play their home games in 20,545-seat Rupp Arena. When it opened in 1976, it was the largest arena in the United States built specifically for basketball, and retained that status for much of the following 40-plus years. It was opened in 1976 and is named after legendary Kentucky head coach Adolph Rupp. Located off-campus, in downtown Lexington, the facility's official capacity was 23,500+[89] until a renovation project in the 2019 offseason reduced the capacity to 20,545.[90] The Wildcats have consistently led the country in home attendance since the 1976–77 season (when Rupp Arena first opened), winning the National Attendance Title a record 25 times, including 17 of the past 20 seasons, and 8 of the last 10 seasons. Kentucky also has an impressive 529–64 (.892) all-time record in Rupp Arena.[91] In 2007, the university unveiled the Joe Craft Center, a state-of-the-art basketball practice facility and athletics office building attached to the north side of Memorial Coliseum on the \"Avenue of Champions\" at the University of Kentucky campus in Lexington, Kentucky.[91] The 102,000 ft2 structure contains separate practice courts for the men's and women's basketball programs, separate men's and women's locker rooms, state-of-the-art video rooms for game film viewing, new coaches offices, a ticket office, and athletic administration offices.[92] As a result, Memorial Coliseum has more ample space for volleyball and gymnastics practice and games. The facility is named after businessman and philanthropist Joe Craft, a Hazard, Kentucky native, who pledged $6 million towards the completion of the $30 million project.[92][93] Coming off back-to-back national championships, the team moved to Memorial Coliseum in 1950. Nicknamed \"The House That Rupp Built\", the multipurpose facility cost $4 million and seated 12,000 people. It also housed a swimming pool, physical education equipment, and offices for the athletics staff. The team occupied Memorial Coliseum for twenty-six seasons, and sold out all 345 home games they played there during that period. Kentucky also played a 2009 NIT game at Memorial Coliseum due to Rupp Arena being booked. The Wildcats are 307–38 (.890) all-time at Memorial Coliseum.[89][91][94] Today, Memorial Coliseum is home to three UK women's teams—basketball, gymnastics, and volleyball. In 1924, Alumni Gymnasium was completed. It included seating for 2,800 people and cost $92,000 to construct.[95] Kentucky played 271 games at Alumni Gymnasium from 1924 to 1950, going 247–24 (.911).[91][96] After a major renovation completed in 2018, it is now a student recreation facility known as Alumni Gym Fitness Center.[97] Woodland Park Auditorium, opened in 1906 and closed in 1941, was located on the corner of East High Street and Kentucky Avenue in Lexington, Kentucky. Kentucky used this facility for home games during World War I between 1914 and 1916 going 15–7 there all-time.[91][98] The Wildcats played 84 home games at Buell Armory Gymnasium from 1910 to 1924. It was named for Union Civil War General Don Carlos Buell who was a member of the first board of trustees at Kentucky.[99] The armory was also used during World War I to teach truck maintenance and repair among other skills.[100] Kentucky was 59–25 all-time at Buell Armory Gymnasium.[101] The first home court for the Wildcats was simply called \"The Gymnasium\" or State College Gymnasium until 1910. It was located in the north wing of Barker Hall on the university campus. Constructed in 1902, it also housed the university's physical education classes until 1909. The facility had a capacity of 650 people, and with no bleachers or seats, fans had to stand to watch the games that were played there.[95] By the 1920s, it had become clear that \"The Gymnasium\" (by then renamed \"The Ladies' Gym\") was inadequate to house the university's basketball team. Records show Kentucky was 17–14 at State College Gymnasium.[91][100][102] (Of the 71 major categories listed above, Kentucky is No. 1 in 50 of them, No. 2 in 16 of them, No. No. 3 in 3 of them, No. 4 in 1 of them, and No. 8 in 1 of them.) Kentucky can also lay claim to several individual achievements for both players and coaches: Kentucky also holds several other NCAA records and various additional accomplishments:",

                "content": "An OpenAI researcher-turned-whistleblower has been found dead in an apartment in San Francisco, authorities said. The body of Suchir Balaji, 26, was discovered on 26 November after police said they received a call asking officers to check on his wellbeing. The San Francisco medical examiner's office determined his death to be suicide and police found no evidence of foul play. In recent months Mr Balaji had publicly spoken out against artificial intelligence company OpenAI's practices, which has been fighting a number of lawsuits relating to its data-gathering practices. In October, the New York Times published an interview with Mr Balaji in which he alleged that OpenAI had violated US copyright law while developing its popular ChatGPT online chatbot. The article said that after working at the company for four years as a researcher, Mr Balaji had come to the conclusion that \"OpenAI's use of copyrighted data to build ChatGPT violated the law and that technologies like ChatGPT were damaging the internet\". OpenAI says its models are \"trained on publicly available data\". Mr Balaji left the company in August, telling the New York Times he had since been working on personal projects. He grew up in Cupertino, California, before going to study computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. A spokesperson for OpenAI said in a statement cited by CNBC News that it was \"devastated to learn of this incredibly sad news today and our hearts go out to Suchir's loved ones during this difficult time\". US and Canadian news publishers, including the New York Times, and a group of best-selling writers, including John Grisham, have filed lawsuits claiming the company was illegally using news articles to train its software. OpenAI told the BBC in November its software is \"grounded in fair use and related international copyright principles that are fair for creators and support innovation\".

                "content": "Suchir Balaji, a 26-year-old former OpenAI researcher turned whistleblower, died in San Francisco on November 26 in a suspected suicide, according to local authorities. The San Francisco Police Department said they found Balaji dead inside his apartment on Buchanan Street after being called to the property for a well-being check at around 1 p.m. on November 26, The Mercury News reported. The past few years have seen dramatic improvements in the capabilities of AI-powered chatbots, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, which rely on large language models to produce content for users. However, the process has also been controversial with some publishers accusing OpenAI of using copyrighted works without permission, and a number of legal cases are currently ongoing. Newsweek contacted OpenAI for comment on Saturday via email outside of regular office hours. The San Francisco medical examiner's office said it determined Balaji's cause of death as suicide. Earlier this week, police said there is \"currently no evidence of foul play.\" Balaji joined OpenAI in 2020 as a researcher, but by 2022 was becoming increasingly concerned about the company's attitude towards copyright law. In an October 23 post on X, formerly Twitter, he said: \"I was at OpenAI for nearly 4 years and worked on ChatGPT for the last 1.5 of them. I initially didn't know much about copyright, fair use, etc. but became curious after seeing all the lawsuits filed against GenAI companies. \"When I tried to understand the issue better, I eventually came to the conclusion that fair use seems like a pretty implausible defense for a lot of generative AI products, for the basic reason that they can create substitutes that compete with the data they're trained on.\" Balaji also shared an interview he gave to The New York Times, which is currently suing OpenAI over alleged copyright infringement of the newspaper. In the interview, Balaji said he initially thought \"A.I. was a thing that could be used to solve unsolvable problems, like curing diseases and stopping aging.\" However, over time, he said he soured on OpenAI's position on copyright law, concluding: \"If you believe what I believe, you have to just leave the company.\" Writing on his website, Balaji said he didn't believe the fair use copyright defense was applicable to what OpenAI was doing with ChatGPT, though he noted that \"similar arguments could be made for many generative AI products in a wide variety of domains.\" Speaking in defense of its business practices in a recent court filing, OpenAI said: \"The models learn, as we all do, from what has come before. \"The fair use defense exists for precisely that reason: to encourage and allow the development of new ideas that build on earlier ones.\" On November 7, U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in New York dismissed one lawsuit against OpenAI which had been brought by media outlets Raw Story and AlterNet. OpenAI was founded in 2015 by a group of technology enthusiasts including Sam Altman and Elon Musk, who became its co-chairs. Musk left the company in 2018 after a disagreement about its strategy, and in February 2024 filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Altman.

                "title": "Pachuca - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Pachuca (Spanish pronunciation: [paˈtʃuka] ⓘ; Mezquital Otomi: Nju̱nthe), formally known as Pachuca de Soto, is the capital and largest city of the east-central Mexican state of Hidalgo, located in the south-central part of the state. Pachuca de Soto is also the name of the municipality for which the city serves as municipal seat. Pachuca is located about 90 kilometres (56 mi) north of Mexico City via Mexican Federal Highway 85.[1] There is no agreed upon consensus regarding the origins of the word pachuca. It has been loosely traced to pachoa ('strait', 'opening'), pachoacan ('place of government', 'place of silver and gold') and patlachuican ('place of factories', 'place of tears').[2] The official name of Pachuca is Pachuca de Soto in honor of congressman Manuel Fernando Soto, who is credited with the founding of Hidalgo state.[3] Its nickname of La Bella Airosa (\"the airy, beautiful\") comes from the strong winds that blow through the canyons to the north of the city.[2] In the indigenous Otomi language, Pachuca is known as Nju̱nthe.[4] The area had been long-inhabited; apart from some green obsidian, the mining that Pachuca is most famous for began in the mid-16th century, during Spanish colonial rule. Pachuca remained a major mining center until the mid-20th century, with the city's fortunes fluctuating with the health of the mining sector. In the mid-20th century, a major downturn in mining pushed the city to shift focus from mining to industry, resulting in the revamping of the Universidad Autónoma de Hidalgo. Today, mining forms only a fraction of the municipality's economy.[2][5] One cultural aspect that makes Pachuca unique is the influence of the Cornish miners who immigrated in the 19th century from Great Britain, as many of their descendants remain in Pachuca, and nearby Real del Monte. Furthermore, the Cornish populace helped to shape two local traditions that define the city—fútbol and a dish called \"pastes.\"[6] Evidence of early human habitation in this area is found in Cerro de las Navajas and Zacualtipán, in the Sierra de Pachuca. Here primitive mines to extract green obsidian, arrow heads, scraping tools, and mammoth remains can be traced back as far as 12,000 BCE. An ancient pre-Hispanic obsidian tool-making center has also been found in the small town of San Bartolo near the city. Around 2,000 BCE nomadic groups here began to be replaced by sedentary peoples who formed farming villages in an area then known as Itzcuincuitlapilco, of which the municipality of Pachuca is a part. Later artifacts from between 200 CE and 850 CE show Teotihuacan influence with platforms and figurines found in San Bartolo and in Tlapacoya. Development of this area as a city, however, would lag behind other places in the region such as Tulancingo, Tula and Atotonilco El Grande,[2] but the archeological sites here were on the trade routes among these larger cities.[5] After the Teotihuacan era, the area was dominated by the Chichimecas with their capital in Xaltocan, who called the area around Pachuca Njunthé. Later, the Chichimecas would found the dominion of Cuauhtitlán pushing the native Otomis to the Mezquital Valley. These conquests coalesced into a zone called Cuautlalpan, of which Pachuca was a part. Fortifications in the area of Pachuca city and other areas were built between 1174 and 1181.[2][5] This dominion would eventually be overrun by the Aztec Triple Alliance between 1427 and 1430, with rule in Pachuca then coming from the city of Tenochtitlan. According to tradition, it was after this conquest that mineral exploitation began here and in neighboring Real del Monte, at a site known as Jacal or San Nicolás.[2] The Aztec governing center was where Plaza Juárez in Pachuca city is now.[3] The Spanish arrived here in 1528, killing the local Aztec governor, Ixcóatl.[3] Credit for the Spanish conquest of the Pachuca area has been given Francisco Téllez, an artilleryman who came to Mexico with Hernán Cortés in 1519.[2] He and Gonzalo Rodriguez were the first Spaniards here, constructing two feudal estates, and calling the area Real de Minas de Pachuca.[3] Téllez was also given credit for laying out the colonial city of Pachuca on the European model but this story has been proven false, with no alternative version.[2] Mining resources were not discovered here until 1552,[7] and there are several versions of this story. The most probable comes from a work called \"Descripción Anónima de la Minas de Pachuca\" (Anonymous Description of the Mines of Pachuca) written between the end of the 16th century and the beginning of the 17th. This work claims that the first mineral deposits were found by Alonso Rodríguez de Salgado on his ranch on the outskirts of Pachuca in two large hills called Magdalena and Cristóbal.[2] This discovery would quickly change the area's economy from agriculture to one dependent almost completely on mining.[5] As early as 1560 the population of the city had tripled to 2,200, with most people employed in mining in some way. Because of this rapid growth and the ruggedness of the terrain, it was impossible to lay out an orderly set of streets. The first main plaza was placed next to the Asunción Parish, which is now the Garden of the Constitution. Next to the Cajas Reales (Royal Safe) was constructed to guard the fifth that belonged to the king.[2] In 1554, on the Purísima Concepción Hacienda, now the site of a tennis club, Bartolomé de Medina found the largest mineral deposits here as well as developed new ways of extracting minerals from ore using the patio process. This caused Pachuca to grow even more with the discovery of new deposits and accelerated extraction processes. Mining operations spread to nearby areas such as Atotonilco, Actopan, and Tizayuca. The population of the town continued to grow, leading Pachuca to be declared a city in 1813.[2][8] Mining output had waned by the 18th century due to flooding, but was revived in 1741 by the first Count of Regla, Pedro Romero de Terreros, and his business partner Jose Alejandro Bustamante, who invested in new drainage works.[8] He also discovered new veins of ore, mostly in nearby Real del Monte.[5] By 1746, Pachuca had a population of 900 Spanish, mestizo, and mulatto households, plus 120 Indian ones.[8] During the Mexican War of Independence, the city was taken by Miguel Serrano and Vicente Beristain de Souza in 1812, which caused the mines here to be abandoned by owners loyal to Spain.[5] The war left the Pachuca area in a state of chaos, both politically and economically. The third Count of Regla brought the first Cornish miners and technology around 1824.[2] The Cornish took over mines abandoned by the Spanish, bringing 1,500 tonnes of more modern equipment from Cornwall.[9] Cornish companies eventually dominated mining here until 1848, when the Mexican–American War forced them to sell out to a Mexican company by the name of Mackintosh, Escondón, Beistegui and John Rule. Mining operations resumed in 1850, especially in the Rosario mine.[2][5][9][10][11][12] Mining operations were disrupted again by the Mexican Revolution in the early 20th century. The city was first taken by forces loyal to Francisco I. Madero in 1911. Roberto Martinez y Martinez, a general under Pancho Villa, entered the city in 1915. Both incursions were due to the economic importance of the mines here.[5] During this time American investors came to Pachuca, again updating the mining technology used here. From 1906 to 1947 the United States Smelting, Refining and Mining Company was the primary producer here, with output reaching its peak in the 1930s. However, by 1947, mining here had become too costly, because of political instability, labor disputes and low prices for silver on the world market. The company sold its interests to the Mexican government in 1965.[2][9] The decline in mining here in the mid-20th century had disastrous effects on the city. Many of the abandoned houses and other buildings were in danger of collapse. Under ownership of the Mexican government, mining came to a near standstill. During this time Pachuca's economy began to shift from mining to industry. The old Instituto Científico Literario Autónomo de Hidalgo was converted to the Universidad Autónoma del Estado in 1961, which would become one of the impetuses to the growth of the city in the following years, turning out as it did a better-educated and more technical workforce in areas such as law, engineering, business and medicine. In the late 1950s and through the 1960s, some growth was seen in the way of suburban developments for workers in newly built factories.[2] Population growth returned in the 1970s and continued through the 1990s because of the growth of non-mining industries as well as a development of a large student population for the state university as well as other educational institutions. Another impetus was the movement of many government offices to Pachuca with new government facilities such as the State Government Palace and the State Supreme Court built in the 1970s. Much of the city's growth during this time was due to new housing projects, but infrastructure projects such as the new Municipal Market, the remodeling of the Plaza Benito Juárez and the main bus station also took place.[2] Pachuca has a semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification BSk). The climate is cool with high rainfall and occasional hail during the summer months and dry conditions during the winter. The coldest month is January, with an average high of 20 °C (68 °F) and an average low of 3 °C (37 °F). Winter nights are cold and the temperature can drop below 0 °C (32 °F). The warmest month is May, with an average high of 24 °C (75 °F) and a low of 9 °C (48 °F). Due to its high altitude, nighttime temperatures remain cool throughout the year. The average annual precipitation is 412 millimetres (16.2 in), mostly concentrated in the months May through September. In terms of extremes, the record high was 34.5 °C (94 °F) and the record low was −9 °C (16 °F). The city occupies a small valley and is almost completely surrounded by large hills, which are also covered in colorful housing.[2] The city centre has maintained most of its colonial-era structures, with narrow winding streets. Away from this centre is the more modern Pachuca, with warehouses, factories, supermarkets and a large football stadium called El Huracán (The Hurricane). The local team has won eight national and international titles here since it was built.[15] The city proper has a population (2005) of 267,751 which is 97% of the population of the municipality.[16] The Pachuca zona metropolitana (ZM) is one of the 56 officially defined areas for the 2005 Census (2010 not released) consisting of the municipalities of Pachuca de Soto, Real del Monte, and Mineral de la Reforma making a total of 7 municipios, with a combined population of 438,692 inhabitants as of 2005[update], up from 375,022 in 2000, covering 1202 km2.[16] Pachuca was declared the capital of Hidalgo by Benito Juárez in 1869.[15] Pachuca is center of one of the most important mining areas in Mexico, and for this reason, most of the city's attractions are based on the mining industry.[17] Many of these are located near Hidalgo Street, which is one of the oldest in Pachuca and runs alongside the arcade of the main plaza (Plaza de la Constitución) to Hidalgo Park. The oldest markets and houses are also located on this street, many of which are well-preserved.[18] The Monumental Clock of Pachuca is the icon of the city. Donated by Cornishman, Francis Rule,[12] it was built to commemorate the Centennial of Mexico's Independence, and was inaugurated on 15 September 1910 (Noche de Grito).[2] The base of the Reloj was made originally for a kiosk but it was decided to put the clock here instead.[17] A group from the city had the idea for the clock, and they, along with Mexican ambassador Jesús Zenil arranged to have the same company that built Big Ben, construct the inner workings. The outer monument portion is Mexican-made and was supervised by engineers Francisco Hernández and Luis Carreón. It is a tower with four parts in Neoclassic style, constructed of white \"cantera\" stone with a height of 40 meters. In the middle there are four sculpted faces of women done in marble by Carrara, which symbolise the Reform, Liberty, Independence and Constitution.[2] The Church and ex monastery of San Francisco were begun in 1596, and the church was completed c. 1660. The façade is in the colonial Spanish Baroque style. The interior conserves aspects of its 16th-century origins, including the groin vault. The church contains oil paintings by regionally well-known artists of the 18th century.[17] The sacristy has a beautiful ritual sinks in sculpted stone, one of which is decorated with Talavera tile from Puebla. It also has paintings depicting the genealogy and life of Francis of Assisi.[2][19] The adjoining cloister was completed in 1604. It has not been a monastery for many years, and had a number of subsequent uses. It had greatly deteriorated, until recently restored to house the Centro Cultural Hidalgo.[2] Behind the church is the Chapel of Nuestra Señora de la Luz. Built between the 17th and 18th century, it contains the only Churrigueresque altar in the city. This altar also contains the remains of the Count of Regla, Pedro Romero de Terreros.[1][17][19] The Museum of Photography and Photographic Library of INAH, and the Regional Museum, occupy much of the complex now.[17][19] The photography museum contains antique photography equipment as well as works by known photographers such as Guillermo Kahlo and Tina Modotti. To the east of the monastery complex is the Bartolomé de Medina Park. The City Theater and the School of Arts face the park.[19] The Asunción Church is the oldest in the city, constructed in 1553, and remodeled several times, with major reconstruction in 1719.[17][19] The Asunción Chapel has an entrance with two levels. The lower one contains the door and has a round arch, flanked by two pilasters and a Baroque architrave. The upper level has a choir window, with a niche above and topped by a pediment. The bell tower also has two levels, both with round arches.[2] The Bancomer Building is located at the front of the main plaza. It was designed in the Neoclassical style, and built in 1902. It was first occupied by the Mercantil Bank, then by the Hidalgo Bank and then was converted into the Niágara Hotel. Today it has returned to being a bank. It has a notable façade of brown cantera stone, lightly sculpted, with a keystone in the form of a parchment, cornice, Ionic columns and geometric designed in the upper parts. It is topped by a pediment which contains the figure of a lion.[2] The Cajas Reales was where miners paid a 20% share of their extractions to the Spanish Crown.[2] It not only collected the taxes, it was the only place that sold the mercury needed to extract silver from ore as a monopoly of the state.[19] It was constructed in the 17th century by viceroy Sebastián de Toledo Márquez Mancera. It is a two-story building with a central patio. The façade contains two towers that flank the main entrance and the north side to serve as guard stations for the building. It has housed the offices of the Compañía Real del Monte y Pachuca since 1850.[2][19] Emperor Maximillian I stayed here when he visited the city in 1865.[19] The Methodist Church building was built in the early 20th century, and is distinguished by its locally rare Romanesque Revival style. It is considered an important building of the Cornish period in the state. It remains a Protestant church and contains the Julián Villagrán School.[2] The Casa Colorado, part of the hacienda of the Conde de Regla, was built in the 18th century. It has an austere façade of a reddish colour, which gives the house its name. The building formerly had an interior courtyard with a Gothic style cloister arcade, but was demolished when enclosed. In 1886 Governor Francisco Cravioto acquired this building to house state judicial offices. The building served the judiciary through the mid-20th century. Many of the streets connecting from here to nearby Hidalgo Street are named after former notable lawyers and judges.[18] The Archivo Historico y Museo de Minería—Historic Archive and Museum of Mining is located on Mina Street in a manor that dates from the 19th century, called the Cajas de San Rafael.[9] The mansion is constructed of cantera stone and occupies a space of 950m2.[9] It contains documents that trace the history of mining here from 1556 to 1967, and the more than a billion ounces of silver and the five million ounces of gold that have been extracted from the state of Hidalgo during that time. The museum has three exhibition halls, a covered courtyard and a garden which contains mining machinery.[2] such as a steam shovel, a winch and a truck used for transport of ore.[19] The exhibition halls contain displays relating to how minerals are found in nature and the tools and processes used to extract them. It also houses a large collection of documents, a library and a photography laboratory. The documentation contained here was rescued starting in 1987. In 1993 the current site was renovated to house the collection. The collection also includes miners' personal effects, as well as artworks relating to mining.[9] The Museo de Mineralogía—Museum of Mineralogy belongs to the Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Hidalgo. The mineralogy museum is housed in the old Hospital de San Juan de Dios. It was built and operated by monks until 1869, when the state converted the building into the Instituto Literario y Escuela de Artes y Oficios. The museum exhibits a large collection of mineral specimens from the region.[2][19] The Municipal Palace or Conde Rule House is located on Leandro Valle and Morelos streets. It is a two-story building constructed at the end of the 19th century. The main entrance is flanked by two pilasters and topped with a pediment decorated with reliefs made of shells. It belonged to a rich Cornish miner by the name of Francis Rule, and later became the Municipal Palace.[2][19] The macromural of Pachuta is located in the Palmitas suburb. It consists of an entire quarter on a hillside painted in colourful murals. Formerly there was an English/Cornish neighborhood in the central part of Pachuca. The British Consulate is all that remains there, located in an \"English style\" residence built at the beginning of the 20th century. The Mercado de Barreteros is on the Central Plaza, and considered one of the most valuable architectural elements in the city. The lower level is dedicated to services such as cafés, and the upper floor is dedicated to arts and crafts shops.[19] The Monument of Christ the King is located on the Santa Apolonia Mountain and is one of the largest in Mexico.[17] The Archivo del Estado de Hidalgo—Museum of the State of Hidalgo is located in the Civic Centre of the State Congress. Its collection focuses on the history of the state of Hidalgo, through archival photographs and documents. Its collection also includes national history items. The Museo El Rehilete is an interactive museum for children with exhibits on archeology, botany, other sciences and the arts.[2] The Sede del Salón de la Fama del Fútbol—Hall of Fame of Football is in the shape of a football, and located in Parque David Ben Gurion of the Zona Plateada district. The Universidad de Fútbol—Football University is the only training facility of its kind in the Americas, and one of only a few in the world.[3] The Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Hidalgo was constructed over the old Hospital de San Juan de Dios.[1] It is the oldest educational institution in Hidalgo, brought into being at the same time as the state. The school was originally established as the Instituto Literario y Escuela de Artes y Oficios (Literary Institute and School of Arts and Letters) in 1869. The school was initially in a rented house but was moved to the former Hospital of San Juan de Dios in 1875. This building is now the Central Building. The school was based on positivist philosophy and the University motto of \"Amor, orden y progreso\" (\"love, order and progress\") remains to this day. The school was renamed the Universidad de Hidalgo in 1925 and again to the Universidad Autónoma de Hidalgo in 1948. The university was reorganized and expanded in 1961.[20] A more recently established school opened in 2003 is the Universidad Politécnica de Pachuca (Polytechnic University of Pachuca), which is mostly an engineering school. It was temporarily housed in the old Universidad Pedagógica Nacional buildings, but in 2004 the state of Hidalgo ceded the university the old Santa Barbara Hacienda, with 231 students studying classes in Mechatronics, Information technology and Biotechnology at the new facility. New programs of study in Physical Therapy, Software engineering, Optomechatronics, Information security, Information technologies and communications.[21] Beginning in 1824, Cornish miners and English investors came to Pachuca and the neighboring town of Real del Monte to invest and work in the mines here. Some founded the Compañía Real de Monte y Pachuca.[15][22] Mexico's remaining Cornish community represents a largely forgotten immigrant story. In the early 19th century, miners in Cornwall were enduring economic hardships. Ships carrying 125 passengers and some 1,500 tons of equipment sailed out of Falmouth, Cornwall, landing in Veracruz three months later. The treacherous 500-kilometre (300 mi) trek inland killed about half of the miners and their family members, many succumbing to malaria and yellow fever. Those who made it settled in Pachuca and Real del Monte. The immigrants brought technology, notably the famous high-pressure steam pumping engines designed by Cornish engineer Richard Trevithick, which turned many of the area's water-logged mines into huge silver producers.[22] The majority of the immigrants to this region came from Cornish mining areas of Camborne, Redruth and Gwennap.[23] Cornish/English workers and their technology revitalized the silver industry here and miners' remittances sent back home helped to build the Wesleyan Chapel in Redruth in the 1820s. Today the Pachuca – Real del Monte District retains much from its period of association with Cornwall and home of one of Mexico's most enduring cross cultural pollinations.[6][22] The miners' influence is obvious in architecture. Up in the hills around Pachuca, many houses feature distinctly British characteristics: thicker walls, square windows and pitched roofs.[22] Some of Pachuca's landmarks have English/Cornish influences. The Spanish Baroque style Reloj Monumental (Monumental Clock) chimes to the tune of Big Ben, and was financed by Francis Rule. The city's main Methodist church was built by Cornish miners. The English mining company's main office as well as the residence of Francis Rule of Camborne, the last Cornish manager of the Real del Monte mine, still bears his initials. The archives of the company are part of the \"Historic Archive and Museum of Mining in Pachuca\" (Museo de Minería) collections, and contain detailed records of Cornish employees, especially between 1824 and 1849.[6] The Cornish immigrants married into Mexican families, and even today Cornish surnames are not uncommon in this area with hundreds of Cornish descendants present. One example is Umberto Skewes, who speaks little English but whose grandfather came to Mexico from Cornwall. Skewes is custodian of the English Cemetery, which contains approximately 600 graves, predominantly of Cornish miners and their families.[6][22] The Cornish-Mexican Cultural Society works to build educational links between Mexico and the United Kingdom.[22] The group has marketed Pachuca and Real del Monte as \"Mexico's Little Cornwall\" through the Mexican embassy in London.[24] Cornish and English miners introduced to Mexico such things as tennis, golf, rugby, cricket, and chess.[6][24][25] However the two introductions which have had the greatest influence on Pachuca's identity are football and pastes.[6] In 1900 Cornish miners established the Pachuca Athletic Club, which was primarily dedicated to football. Their first game was played in the same year, a fact that is celebrated annually. The first team from Pachuca consisted of Charles Dawe, John Dawe, James Bennetts, John Bennetts, William Blamey, Richard Sobey, William Bragg, William Thomas, Percy Bunt, Lionel Bunt, Albert Pengelly and William Pengelly. The Pachuca club encouraged the formation of teams in Mexico City and Orizaba, the first championship of the new Liga Mexicana de Fútbol Asociación was played in 1902. Other clubs, such as the Reform Athletic Club, El British Club, F. C. and El México Cricket Club were also formed by miners. The first Mexican player appears in the ranks of the Pachuca club in 1908 and by 1915, most of the team was Mexican. Pachuca won the Copa Tower in 1908 and 1912, the precedent of the modern Mexican Cup. The team disbanded in the 1920s but was re-instituted in 1951.[6][26] Pachuca calls itself the \"Cradle of Mexican Football.\"[27] The Mexican Spanish word \"paste\" (pronounced PAH-steh) come from the Cornish word pasties, which is basically a semi-circular turnover made with a pastry crust with sweet or savory fillings. Cornish miners brought the recipe with them as they made a good way to bring their midday meal with them to the mines. One feature of both pasties and pastes is that they have a thick braided edge. Originally, this was done to provide the miners a way to hold the turnover without getting the filled portion dirty, as there was no way to wash their hands before eating. The shape and pastry portion of the turnover have remained the same but today, the fillings are decidedly Mexican: mole verde, beans, mole rojo, chicken \"tinga,\" pineapple, rice pudding and one seasonal specialty is a lamb paste with poblano chili peppers. Pastes are a local delicacy strongly identified with both Pachuca and Real del Monte.[6][28] The Feria de Pachuca is known colloquially by several names such as the Feria Tradicional/Internacional de San Francisco, the Feria de Hidalgo and the Feria de Caballo. It is the most important annual event in the state of Hidalgo, taking place every October in facilities located in the south of Pachuca. The festival began as a liturgical event sponsored by monks at the monastery of San Francisco in the 16th century, which eventually drew dignitaries from surrounding communities. The festival sponsors a number of events such as bullfights, cockfights, charreadas, horse shows, rodeos, crafts and folk dance shows, livestock exhibitions and features regional cuisine. It also host concerts by well-known Mexican musical artists.[2][28][29] Other notable events in the city include the Ramón Noble Guitar Festival and the Feria Hidaltur. The first presents concerts by guitarists of various genres from countries such as Brazil, Spain, the U.S., Israel, England and Mexico. There are classes and workshops by renowned artists as well as a national level competition for classical guitar.[30] The Feria Hidaltur is held in March and April with the purpose of promoting the arts and crafts of Hidalgo state. The festival also has equestrian events, hot-air balloons and other attractions.[29] Despite its decline in the 20th century, mining still continues to be an important element of Pachuca's economy. Pachuca still produces more than 60% of the state's gold and more than 50% of its silver. The Mexican Geological Survey is headquartered in the city. The manufacturing sector was established in the 1950s and has been steadily growing, changing the city's traditional mining image. Some of the major industrial employers are Applied Power de México (automotive parts), BARROMEX (machinery), Herramientas Cleveland (machinery and tools) and Embotelladora la Minera (soft drinks). The city also contains over 800 smaller manufacturing enterprises. The municipality's economy also has a large commercial sector, with numerous stores and thirteen public markets. It is also the wholesale center for foodstuffs for most of the state. Despite all the changes in the 20th century, the center of Pachuca has maintained its provincial feel. This has led the city to promote it as a tourist attraction.[2][5] The Pachuca Municipality is increasingly co-extensive with the city, as the city's metro area development grows to cover over 60% of the available open space. The municipality contains fifteen other communities, with all but two having less than 1500 people according to the 2005 INEGI census. Only three percent of the municipality population of 275,578 lives outside the city boundaries.[31] All of Pachuca’s mines worked silver ore which was dressed using the patio process, similar to at Real Del Monte. The last mine to close was El Álamo in 1993 .[34]",

                "title": "Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Purdue Boilermakers basketball team is a men's college basketball program that competes in NCAA Division I and is a founding member of the Big Ten Conference. Purdue basketball has the most Big Ten regular season championships with 26 conference titles, and in 2024 became the first Big Ten program to be ranked as the #1 team in America for three consecutive seasons.[2][3] As of April 2024, Purdue also holds a winning record against all other Big Ten schools in head-to-head match ups.[4][5][6] The Boilermakers have reached three NCAA Tournament Final Fours and two NCAA championship games, but have not won an NCAA Championship. The 1931–32 team was retroactively named a national champion by the Helms Athletic Foundation and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.[7][8] Purdue has sent more than 30 players to the NBA, including two overall No. 1 picks in the NBA draft. Purdue's main rival is the Indiana Hoosiers. The history of Purdue basketball dates back to 1896 with their first game against the Lafayette YMCA, which they won 34-19.[3] In the 1902–03 season, head coach C.I. Freeman, in his only season, led them to an undefeated 8–0 record. Upon conclusion of the season, the university recognized the popularity of the sport and made it part of the Purdue University Athletic Association. The Boilermakers began play in the Big Ten Conference three years later, with its first championship coming in 1911 under the direction of Ralph Jones. In 1917, Ward \"Piggy\" Lambert, a former basketball player at Wabash College, was named head coach of the Boilermakers. What followed was one of the most dominant eras of Purdue Basketball on the conference and national level. Under Lambert, Purdue became a front-runner in the development of the fast-paced game as it is today. In 28 seasons, Lambert mentored 16 All-Americans and 31 First Team All-Big Ten selections, which included the 1932 National Player of the Year John Wooden. Wooden was the first college player to be named a Consensus All-American three times. Lambert compiled a career record of 371–152, a .709 winning percentage. His 228 wins in Big Ten play have been bested by only Indiana's Bob Knight, Michigan State's Tom Izzo, and former Purdue head coach Gene Keady.[3] Lambert won an unprecedented 11 Big Ten Championships, which Bobby Knight later tied for most in conference history. In 1943, the Helms Athletic Foundation retroactively recognized Purdue as its national champion for 1932. The Premo-Porretta Power Poll later recognized the Boilermakers as the 1932 national champion as well. Ward Lambert announced his resignation on January 23, 1946. That same year and the year following, under new head coach Mel Taube, Purdue won both meetings against coach John Wooden's Indiana State team. On February 24, 1947, three students were killed (one of whom died the next day) and 166 people were taken to hospitals after the 3,400-student section of the Purdue Fieldhouse collapsed during a game against Wisconsin. Center Paul Hoffman became the only Boiler to be named a First Team-All Big Ten selection four times in 1947. With third overall-picked teammate Ed \"Bulbs\" Ehlers (who played for John Wooden at South Bend Central High School), the two were the first players in the program's history to be selected in the NBA draft, while Paul Hoffman became the BAA's (original title of the NBA) first player named Rookie of the Year in 1948. After Mel Taube's four-and-a-half seasons, Ray Eddy, a former player and teammate of Wooden's under Lambert, took over as head coach. During his 15-year tenure, he coached Terry Dischinger and Dave Schellhase, both Consensus All-Americans, and Ernie Hall, the first Purdue junior college transfer and African-American player to wear a Boilermaker uniform. In 1955, his team played one of the longest games in college basketball history, lasting six overtimes in a loss to Minnesota. Over the next few decades the Boilermakers enjoyed moderate success, culminating in 1969 when they won their first conference title in 29 years and advanced to the 1969 NCAA Finals game under head coach George King and led by All-American Rick Mount, where they fell to former Purdue great John Wooden and his UCLA Bruins squad. Former Los Angeles Lakers coach/general manager, Fred Schaus, who also spent time as West Virginia's head coach, took over the program after George King stepped down to become solely the school's athletic director. Schaus led the Boilermakers to the 1974 NIT Championship, becoming the first Big Ten team to capture the NIT title. In the 1978–79 season, new head coach Lee Rose introduced Purdue basketball to a new approach with a slowed-down, controlled style of play. With All-American center Joe Barry Carroll, he led them to the 1979 NIT Finals and to a 1980 NCAA Final Four appearance. In 1980, Gene Keady, the head coach of Western Kentucky and former assistant to Eddie Sutton with the Arkansas Razorbacks, was named the new head coach of the Boilermakers. Over the next 25 years, Keady led the Boilermakers to six Big Ten Championships, 17 NCAA Tournament appearances with two Elite Eights and no Final Fours. Purdue received their highest Associated Press and Coaches Poll ranking in its program's history during the 1987–88 season, where they were ranked as high as 2nd in the nation. They were ranked 1st in the nation during the 2021–2022 season. In 1991, Keady and assistant coach Frank Kendrick recruited Glenn Robinson, who ultimately became an All-American and Purdue's second-named National Player of the Year. A few years later, Purdue managed to recruit the program's first of several foreign players when they picked up Matt ten Dam from the Netherlands. In December 1997, Keady became Purdue's all-time winningest head coach, surpassing Lambert with his 372nd win. He also became the second-winningest coach in Big Ten history behind Indiana's Bobby Knight, against whom Keady went 21–20 in head-to-head meetings. Soon afterward, the playing surface at Mackey Arena was named Keady Court in his honor. Many of Keady's former assistant coaches and players throughout the years have gone on to enjoy success as head coaches. Included in the Gene Keady coaching tree is current Purdue head coach Matt Painter, former St. John's head coach Steve Lavin, former Pittsburgh head coach Kevin Stallings, former Kansas State head coach Bruce Weber, former Wisconsin–Green Bay head coach Linc Darner, former UNC Charlotte head coach Alan Major, former Missouri and current Missouri State head coach Cuonzo Martin, former Missouri State head coach and current Purdue assistant coach Paul Lusk, and former Illinois State head coach Dan Muller. Following the 1998–99 season, the NCAA placed Purdue on two years' probation due to minor violations over recruiting, benefits, and ethics. Purdue also lost one scholarship per season for the 2000–01 and 2001–02 seasons. Most severely, Purdue assistant Frank Kendrick was found to have provided an illegal benefit to Purdue player Luther Clay, who transferred to Rhode Island after his freshman year, namely a $4,000 bank loan.[9] Clay was found to be ineligible due to his extra benefit, so Purdue forfeited all 19 victories in which Clay played, including one win in the 1996 NCAA tournament.[10] As the Keady era came to a close in 2005, the Matt Painter era began. Painter played for Keady during the early 1990s, with Keady naming him captain in his senior year in 1993. After one season at Southern Illinois as the head coach after Bruce Weber left north for Illinois, Painter was hired as a planned replacement for Coach Keady for the 2004–05 season as Keady's associate head coach. After a disappointing first season marred with injuries and suspensions from off-court altercations, Painter re-energized Purdue basketball in the summer of 2006 by signing the top recruiting class in the conference and made one of the biggest turnarounds in the program's history. His \"Baby Boilers\" developed into three eventual All-Americans, including 2011 consensus selection JaJuan Johnson, that led Purdue to four consecutive NCAA Tournaments and back-to-back Sweet Sixteen appearances, a Big Ten title, and a conference tournament championship. During the 2010 season, Matt Painter led the Boilermakers to a school record-tying 14–0 start, as well with the most wins in a season with a 29–6 record and a Big Ten title. The season ended in relative disappointment, however, as Junior Robbie Hummel was sidelined with an ACL injury in February of that season. The following year, and with the anticipated return of Hummel, E'Twaun Moore, and Johnson, Purdue looked poised to have one of its program's finest seasons. This excitement was quickly tempered when Hummel re-tore his ACL on the first practice of the season, sidelining him for its duration once again. Despite Hummel's absence, Purdue remained in the top ten most of the season, being ranked as high as 6th and finished the regular season with a 26–8 record. At the conclusion of the 2010–2011 season, Johnson and Moore declared for the NBA draft. On June 23, 2011, both Johnson and Moore were drafted to the Boston Celtics in the first and second rounds, respectively. Purdue began the 2012 season with a 12–3 record, holding the fifth best home winning streak in the nation with 27, before leading the nation with the fewest turnover average per game. The home winning streak was lost during the 2012 season to Alabama. They finished with a 10–8 conference record, giving Purdue its sixth consecutive 22+ win season, the best in the program's history. In the 2012 NBA draft, Robbie Hummel was the 58th overall pick by the Minnesota Timberwolves. The following two seasons brought slim success, missing out on both the NCAA Tournament and the NIT. They accepted a bid in the 2013 CBI, where they lost in the second round to Santa Clara. After a moderate 8–5 preseason campaign during the 2015 season, Purdue got back on track, finishing 3rd in the conference after finishing last the season prior. The 2015 season ended after losing to Cincinnati in overtime. It was the first time the program lost its opener in the NCAA Tournament since 1993, breaking a 14-game win streak. After making it back to the NCAA tourney, the program landed its biggest recruit in nearly a quarter century when Fort Wayne native Caleb Swanigan, a top ten recruit, de-committed from Michigan State. They opened the 2016 season with an 11–0 record, while setting a program record with consecutive double-digit victories and were ranked as high as 9th in the nation. That season ended with an NCAA First Round loss to Little Rock with a 26–9 record. In May 2016, it was announced that the 2017–18 Purdue team would represent the U.S. at the 2017 World University Games in Taipei.[11] The team went on to win the silver medal at the Games, winning every game until losing to Lithuania in the gold medal game. Purdue won the outright 2017 Big Ten Conference title, along with Caleb Swanigan being named unanimous B1G Player of the Year. In the 2017 NCAA Tournament, Purdue reached the Sweet Sixteen, losing to #1 seed Kansas. In the 2017–2018 season, Purdue, led by seniors Vince Edwards, Isaac Haas, PJ Thompson, Dakota Mathias and sophomore Carsen Edwards, spent several weeks at #3 while being on a program record and nation-leading 19-game winning streak. During that time, the Boilers led the nation in scoring margin, points per game, three-point shooting, and was one of only two teams with a top 3 ranking in both offensive and defensive efficiency. Purdue missed out on a consecutive B1G title after losing to Wisconsin, finishing 2nd in the conference at 15–3. The Boilers were seeded 4th in the Big Ten tournament, where they beat Rutgers and Penn State to reach the Big Ten tournament Championship for the second time in three years. They faced a familiar opponent in Michigan, whom they had already faced two other times throughout that season, Purdue winning both meetings. However, Michigan beat Purdue 75–66 to become Big Ten tournament Champions for the second straight season. Purdue was seeded 2nd in the East Region of the 2018 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, their highest seed in recent history. In the first round, they faced Cal State Fullerton Titans, winning 74–48. However, many Purdue fan's hearts broke in the second half of the game, as senior Center Isaac Haas fell on his elbow as he fought for a rebound, and broke his elbow as he hit the ground, ending his Purdue Basketball career. Purdue's second-round game was against Butler Bulldogs, whom Purdue had already played earlier in the season. The Boilers won the game on a last second shot by Dakota Mathias, winning 76–73 to advance to the Sweet Sixteen for the second straight season. In the Sweet Sixteen, Purdue faced the third seeded Texas Tech Red Raiders. The Boilers went on to lose in disappointing fashion 65–78, ending their season with 30 wins. In 2019, Purdue was seeded 3rd in the South Region of the 2019 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, after another strong season. In the first round, they eliminated a 26–8 Old Dominion team that was coming off a Conference USA championship, winning 61–48. In the second round, they handily defeated #6 seed Villanova, sending the defending champs home early after an 87–61 victory, and advancing to their third straight Sweet Sixteen under Matt Painter. The Boilermakers ran into their first real test with the #2 Tennessee Volunteers. After a back and forth contest that included 17 lead changes and needed overtime to be decided, Purdue came out victorious, barely beating the Vols 99–94 to reach their first Elite Eight in nearly 20 years. In the Elite Eight, Purdue faced the #1 seeded Virginia Cavaliers in what was another back and forth thriller. After several lead changes throughout the game, and a 40-point effort from Carsen Edwards including 10 made 3s, Purdue led 70–67 with 5.9 seconds left and looked to be headed to their first Final Four since 1980. Virginia's Ty Jerome was fouled intentionally, and missed the second free throw of two after making the first. Virginia was able to come up with the offensive rebound, and after chasing down the loose ball that had gone into the Virginia back court, toss the ball to Mamadi Diakite who hit a free-throw line floater at the buzzer to send the game to overtime tied at 70. The Boilermakers once again looked to be en route to the Final Four, leading 75–74 with 43 seconds to go. However Virginia was able to hold Purdue scoreless over the final minute and prevailed 80–75, ending the Boilermakers season with 26 wins and their first Elite Eight appearance since 2000. After the cancellation of the 2020 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, Purdue picked up where they had left off in 2019, only this time they were the 4th seed in the South region of the 2021 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. Their first-round matchup was against 13th-seeded North Texas, where they came back from behind 32–24 at the half to send the game to OT. Ultimately, once there, Purdue couldn't score until the last 30 seconds of overtime, and North Texas pulled off the 78–69 upset. The 2022 season saw the Boilermakers reach #1 in the AP Poll for the first time in program history, led by senior Trevion Williams, and All-American sophomore guard Jaden Ivey. In the 2022 tournament, Purdue reached the Sweet Sixteen after a second round win over Texas, only to lose to the Cinderella story of that year's tournament, the 15-seeded Saint Peter's Peacocks. The following year, Purdue put together a 29–5 season that again had them reach #1 in the AP poll at various points in the season, and saw them win the Big 10 regular-season championship for a record extending 25th time, and postseason tournament championship for the first time since 2009, leading to a #1 seed in the East Region of the 2023 NCAA Tournament. Center Zach Edey was also voted the third player in Purdue history to win National Player of the Year honors. Purdue would then became the second team in NCAA Tournament history to be upset by a 16-seed, falling 63–58 to Fairleigh Dickinson in the First Round, suffering the biggest upset in NCAA tournament history with Purdue being 23+1⁄2-point favorites heading into the game. The 2024 season was more of the same in West Lafayette, with the Boilermakers winning their second consecutive outright Big Ten regular season championship, extending their Big Ten record to 26 titles. Zach Edey was named National Player of the Year unanimously for the second straight season, becoming the first men's college basketball player to win the award in back-to-back years since Ralph Sampson in 1983. Purdue was awarded a #1 seed for the second consecutive year in the 2024 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, this time in the Midwest Region. They cruised into the Sweet Sixteen with routs against 16 seed Grambling State, 78–50, and 8 seed Utah State, 106–67. With the victory against Utah State, they achieved their 31st win of the season, breaking the program record of most wins in a season. They then defeated 5 seed Gonzaga in Detroit 80–68, following a second-half surge, and moved on to the Elite Eight for the first time since 2019. There the Boilermakers met a familiar foe in the tournament on Easter Sunday, the 2 seeded Tennessee Volunteers, led by in many around the nation's opinion the second best player in the country, Dalton Knecht. Zach Edey scored 40 points to go along with 16 rebounds, leading the Boilermakers to a thrilling 72–66 victory and a trip to the Final Four in Phoenix, the first under Matt Painter's tenure and the first since 1980. The victory was a monumental day in the history of Purdue Men's basketball, with many in and around the team signifying the win as a watershed moment for the program by getting back to the Final Four after years of underachieving in the NCAA tournament. Former All-American Robbie Hummel was on the sideline for the radio broadcast of the game, and was moved to tears when embracing members of the Purdue coaching staff post game, including his former head coach Matt Painter. Following the long awaited trip to the Final Four in Phoenix, the Boilermakers faced off against surprise tournament Cinderella NC State led in part by tournament darling big man D. J. Burns. The Boilermakers controlled the game throughout and pulled away in the second half to win their first Final Four game since 1969 by a score of 63-50, advancing to the National Championship game for the first time in 55 years. There Purdue would eventually find the defending national champion UConn Huskies after their victory over Alabama in the later of the 2 Final Four games. The 2024 NCAA Tournament would come down to a match up of two All-American level 7 footers, as UConn came into the championship game led in part by 7 foot 2 Donovan Clingan, leading to the game being billed as a matchup of 2 twin towers at the center position. Purdue kept the game close for most of the first half after entering the game a 6 point underdog, but was unable to rely on their usual three point shooting prowess (Going 1 for 7 from three point range) as UConn's elite perimeter defense made it difficult to convert their usual amount of three point shots. Zach Edey scored 37 points to go along with 10 rebounds in his final game at Purdue, but UConn pulled away in the second half to win their second consecutive national title 75-60. Following the conclusion of the season, Zach Edey would declare for the 2024 NBA Draft, leaving the program as Purdue's all-time leader in points, rebounds, and field goal percentage.

                "content": "The Tennessee Volunteers men's basketball team is the collegiate men's basketball program for the University of Tennessee–Knoxville. The Volunteers (commonly referred to as the \"Vols\") compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The Volunteers play their home games in Thompson–Boling Arena, on a court nicknamed \"the Summitt\", after former Tennessee Lady Vols basketball coach Pat Summitt. With a current capacity of 21,678 (formerly 24,535), Tennessee has consistently ranked in the top 15 in the nation in terms of volume of attendance, averaging 14,817 (60.39% capacity) attendance from 1988 through 2006, and averaging 17,194 (79.34% capacity) attendance from 2007 through 2018 after reducing seating capacity prior to the 2007 season.[2][3] Historically, Tennessee ranks third in the SEC in all-time wins.[4] Many notable players have played collegiately at Tennessee—players such as Bernard King, Dale Ellis, Allan Houston, Tobias Harris, and Grant Williams who all play(ed) in the NBA. Chris Lofton, Ron Slay, Tyler Smith, and John Fulkerson are also notable players who later played professionally in other leagues. The Volunteers are currently coached by Rick Barnes, who was hired on March 31, 2015, to replace Donnie Tyndall. In 1963, the University of Tennessee hired Ray Mears to become the head coach of the men's basketball program. The hiring of Mears, who was coming off an NCAA small college championship at Wittenberg University, ushered in the most sustained period of success in Tennessee men's basketball history. In his first year, Mears's Volunteers improved from a 4–19 record in 1962 to 13–11, highlighted by two wins over the Kentucky Wildcats. Before Mears, Tennessee had only beaten the Wildcats twice in 39 meetings. Throughout his career, Mears gained notoriety throughout the SEC for frequently being a thorn in the powerhouse Kentucky's side.[citation needed] In an era where Kentucky was coached by future College Basketball Hall of Fame members Adolph Rupp and Joe B. Hall, winning 75% of their games, Mears recorded a 15–15 record against the Wildcats. Led by A. W. Davis, the Volunteers finished second in the SEC in each of the next two seasons and recorded 20 wins in 1965, reaching that mark for the first time in 17 years. This success and the resultant growing fan support led to the university's decision to expand the 7,500-seat Amory-Fieldhouse to 12,700 seats. It was renamed Stokely Athletic Center to honor William B. Stokely, whose donation funded the renovation. In the expanded Stokely Center's inaugural season, the Volunteers captured the 1967 SEC championship and made the program's first-ever NCAA tournament appearance. Dubbed the \"Fearless Five,\" the 1967 team won road games against top conference teams Florida, Kentucky, and Mississippi State. The win over Mississippi State, coming in double-overtime on a pair of Bill Justus free throws, secured Tennessee's first SEC championship in 24 years and is referred to by some as the greatest basketball game in Tennessee history.[citation needed] From 1968 to 1973, Mears kept Tennessee among the top teams of the SEC, winning a second SEC championship in 1972 and finishing second in every year except 1970. In 1974, Mears and his trusted assistant Stu Aberdeen were able to recruit New York City standout forward Ernie Grunfeld to Knoxville. In his freshman season, Grunfeld led the team in scoring, averaging 17.4 points per game, and received first-team All-SEC honors. The following season, Grunfeld was joined by fellow New Yorker Bernard King. Known as \"The Ernie and Bernie Show,\" King and Grunfeld led the Volunteers to a 61–20 record over three years and an SEC championship in 1977. During their three years together, Tennessee posted a 5–1 record against Kentucky. The Volunteers reached the National Invitation Tournament in 1975 and the NCAA tournament in 1976 and 1977. King was named first-team All-American and SEC Player of the Year in 1975 and 1976, and then shared the honor with Grunfeld in 1977, with both being named SEC Co-Player of the Year. Grunfeld graduated from Tennessee in 1977 and King chose to forgo his senior year to enter the NBA draft. King was drafted 7th overall to the New Jersey Nets and Grunfeld went 11th overall to the Milwaukee Bucks. Both enjoyed long and illustrious NBA careers. Perhaps the biggest impact of the \"Ernie and Bernie\" show was how it changed the national perception of the Tennessee basketball program.[citation needed] This \"Double Trouble from Tennessee\" was featured in the February 1976 edition of Sports Illustrated.[5] In 2013, ESPN premiered a 30 for 30 documentary called \"Bernie and Ernie\" about the all-time great Volunteer basketball players. Following the exit of his two biggest stars, Mears, who long struggled with depression,[6] was not able to coach the team in 1978. Under the watch of interim coach Cliff Wettig, the Volunteers struggled to an 11–16 record, and Mears officially retired for health reasons after the season.[7] Mears is remembered not only as the greatest coach in Tennessee men's basketball history, but also as a great entertainer and marketer.[citation needed] From the beginning of his time at Tennessee, Mears employed marketing tactics to get fans to games—from his patented and provocative orange blazer, to his introduction of the Pride of the Southland Band to basketball games, to his entertaining pre-game warmups that compared to the Harlem Globetrotters for creativity.[8] At the beginning of his tenure, Mears declared, \"This is Big Orange Country,\" and this slogan has lived on long past his coaching years.[9] Don DeVoe was named Mears's successor and took over as head coach for the 1979 season. Despite the losing record in 1978, DeVoe inherited a roster centered on All-American center Reggie Johnson. DeVoe's 1979 Volunteers finished the regular season with a 21–12 record, beating Kentucky twice and earning a second-place finish in the SEC. The 1979 SEC tournament was the first held in 27 years, and the Volunteers reached the tournament finals, where they once again defeated Kentucky by a score of 75–69 to win their first SEC Tournament championship since 1943. With the tournament championship win, the Volunteers were invited back to the NCAA tournament, where they recorded the program's first NCAA tournament win with a defeat of Eastern Kentucky. Tennessee was eliminated in the second round with a loss to Notre Dame. DeVoe led Tennessee to the NCAA tournament each of the next five years, but none of his teams advanced past the second round. Through his first seven years at UT, DeVoe compiled an overall record of 143–79 (.644). The program's momentum under his direction eventually weakened, however, and the Volunteers were not invited to the NCAA tournament or the NIT in 1986 or 1987. Entering the 1989 season, DeVoe's 11th year at Tennessee, his teams had not reached the NCAA tournament or finished above 6th in the SEC since 1983. DeVoe led the Volunteers to a 19–11 record and a berth in the NCAA tournament. After an 84–68 loss to West Virginia in the first round, DeVoe resigned. The growth of UT basketball under DeVoe is still seen today in the Vols' current home arena, Thompson–Boling Arena, which was built during his tenure. By the mid-1980s, the overflow crowds had grown too large for the 12,700-seat Stokley Athletic Center. In 1988, the Volunteers moved to the new $30 million Thompson–Boling Arena, which seated over 24,500 people—at the time, the largest facility ever built specifically for basketball in the United States. Sitting on the banks of the Tennessee River nearby historic Neyland Stadium, the arena has accommodated 21,678 people since a 2007 renovation. In 1990, Wade Houston, an Alcoa, Tennessee native and former assistant coach at Louisville, became the first African-American head coach in Tennessee and SEC history. Houston's son, Allan Houston, came to UT to play for his father and would become one of the most accomplished players in Tennessee history. With 2801 points, Allan Houston finished his career as Tennessee's all-time leading scorer and was named All-American in 1992 and 1993. Houston was fired after a 5–22 campaign in 1994, finishing the worst season in Tennessee history. None of his teams reached the NCAA tournament, and only two of his teams received invitations to the NIT, the two of which were also his only teams to finish with winning records. Houston finished with an overall record of 65–90 at Tennessee. Houston was replaced by Kevin O'Neill in 1995. O'Neill—an intense and somewhat high-strung sideline coach, but also a skilled recruiter[citation needed]—took over a program depleted in talent. He was able to sign talented players such as Brandon Wharton, Tony Harris, and Isiah Victor. O'Neill left Tennessee to become the head coach at Northwestern after the 1997 season. O'Neill was replaced by Oregon Ducks head coach Jerry Green. Green inherited a roster with significant young talent and was able to an immediate improvement in on-court success. His first Tennessee team produced a 20–9 overall record—a nine-win improvement over the 11–16 record of O'Neill's third and final UT team—and advanced to the 1998 NCAA tournament. In his second year, Green's Volunteers won the 1999 SEC East Division championship and defeated Kentucky twice in the same season for the first time since 1979, in what is generally regarded to be the best overall year in school athletics history. (The 1998 Tennessee Football team finished 13–0 and won the first-ever BCS National Championship. In women's basketball, Pat Summitt led the Lady Volunteers to a 39–0 NCAA championship season, the program's third consecutive national title.) The 2000 Tennessee men's basketball team finished 26–7, repeating as SEC East champions, winning the Volunteers' first SEC championship since 1982, and setting a program record for most wins in a single season. In the NCAA tournament, the Volunteers advanced to the first Sweet Sixteen in school history, where they lost a close contest to North Carolina. Green's Volunteers began the 2001 season with a 16–1 record, rising to No. 4 in the AP Poll. Beginning with a ten-point loss at Kentucky in mid-January, Tennessee then struggled to a 22–11 finish. Green's team advanced to the NCAA tournament—the fourth appearance in Green's four seasons—losing in the first round. Coupled with his multiple incidents with local media and Tennessee fans,[10] this disappointing finish to the season led to Green's resignation. He was replaced by Buzz Peterson, who failed to lead the program to an NCAA tournament berth in his four years as head coach. He was fired after the 2005 season, in which his team finished 14–17. After taking Wisconsin–Milwaukee to a Sweet Sixteen in 2005, Bruce Pearl was hired as the new Tennessee men's basketball coach. Pearl's assistants Tony Jones, Steve Forbes, Jacob Nichols, Jason Shay, and Ken Johnson were part of a staff that would help to lead the Volunteers to the NCAA tournament six years in a row. Pearl inherited a roster that had not experienced much winning, but showed promise with future NBA senior point guard C. J. Watson and All-SEC freshman team shooting guard Chris Lofton. Pearl's coaching, which included playing an up-tempo style and pressing defense, led to immediate gains for Tennessee. In his first season, Pearl led the Volunteers to a 22–8 record, an SEC East Division championship, and a no. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament. Pearl's first team achieved some of the more memorable wins in program history, including two wins against the eventual national champion Florida Gators. Another memorable win came when Chris Lofton, who is a Kentucky native, led the Volunteers over Kentucky in Rupp Arena for the program's first win there since 1999. Pearl's 2006 recruiting class was ranked among the top ten in college basketball.[11] Despite the influx of freshmen and their inexperience, the Volunteers were able to open with a 13–2 start to the season. All-American guard Chris Lofton was injured and missed a good portion of January and early February, during which time the Volunteers opened 3–5 in SEC play. After Lofton returned, Tennessee won 7 out of their last 8 regular season games. Given a no. 5 seed, the Volunteers returned to the Sweet Sixteen where they faced no. 1 seed Ohio State. Tennessee led 49–32 at halftime, but the eventual NCAA runner-up Buckeyes mounted a comeback to defeat the Volunteers by a score of 85–84. During the 2006–07 season, the Volunteers were ranked 4th nationally in attendance, with an average of 19,661 fans in Thompson–Boling Arena, which has a capacity of 21,758. This marked an increase in attendance of an average of 7,436 per game since Pearl arrived in March 2005.[citation needed] Preseason expectations for the Volunteers were high entering the 2008 season.[12] Chris Lofton was a preseason pick by some to win National Player of the Year, and he was joined by Tyler Smith, an All-Big Ten freshman transfer from Iowa. Senior guards JaJuan Smith and Jordan Howell, along with rising sophomores Wayne Chism and Ramar Smith, propelled the Volunteers to a preseason no. 7 ranking. The team posted a record of 28–3 in the regular season. The season was highlighted by the rivalry matchup between Tennessee and Memphis. John Calipari's Tigers were undefeated and ranked no. 1 and the Volunteers were no. 2. In front the largest TV audience to date to ever watch a game on ESPN, the two teams remained evenly matched for thirty-nine minutes. The Volunteers trailed 61–60 with 30 seconds left before Tyler Smith made a jump-shot to give UT the lead. The Volunteers added three free throws and took the contest by a score of 66–62. The following Monday, Tennessee was ranked no. 1 in polls for the first time in school history. The Volunteers finished the regular season as the outright SEC champions and the no. 1 seed for the SEC Tournament in Atlanta. The Volunteers won their first game to set up a semifinal matchup against Arkansas in the Georgia Dome. The night before the game, an EF2 tornado hit Downtown Atlanta, damaging the Georgia Dome and much of the surrounding area. Because of this, the tournament was nearly canceled but was ultimately moved to Georgia Tech's Alexander Memorial Coliseum. The Razorbacks were able to upset the Volunteers, denying them a place in the final and a shot at their first SEC Tournament championship in 30 years. The Volunteers received a no. 2 seed in the NCAA tournament. They advanced to the Sweet Sixteen, where they lost to the Louisville Cardinals men's basketball. Despite the disappointing ending, the 2008 season is remembered as one of the best in program history. Replacing Chris Lofton proved a difficult task in the 2009 season. Now led by Tyler Smith, the Volunteers finished with a 21–13 record. However, Tennessee claimed another SEC division championship. The Volunteers advanced to the SEC Tournament Championship in Tampa before losing to Mississippi State 64–61. The Volunteers lost their NCAA tournament first-round game to Oklahoma State. Entering the regular season ranked in the top 10, the Volunteers started the season 10–2. On New Year's Day, players Melvin Goins, Cam Tatum, Brian Williams, and leading scorer Tyler Smith were arrested after a traffic stop when police found marijuana and an illegal firearm.[13] The players were all suspended for multiple games and Tyler Smith was eventually dismissed from the team.[14] After the suspensions, the Volunteers were left with only six scholarship players. The Volunteers defeated Charlotte and then hosted no. 1 Kansas the next game. In front of a sellout crowd, the undermanned Volunteers defeated the Jayhawks 76–68. Tennessee cemented its lead with a shot clock-beating three-point shot with under a minute left by local freshman walk-on Skylar McBee, who entered the rotation due to the suspensions. Tennessee rode the momentum of the Kansas upset to a 23–7 regular season record. This included another upset of second-ranked Kentucky, which featured future NBA All-Stars John Wall and DeMarcus Cousins, as well as four other eventual NBA players. The Volunteers won 74–65 at home in front of a raucous crowd. The Wildcats were able to avenge the loss a week and half later in the SEC Tournament. As a no. 6 seed in a bracket featuring overall top seed Kansas, the Volunteers defeated a Steve Fisher-coached San Diego State team with Kawhi Leonard in the first round. No. 14 seed Ohio upset the no. 3 seed Georgetown Hoyas, setting up a matchup between the Volunteers and the Bobcats in the following round. After winning 83–68, Tennessee advanced to Bruce Pearl's third Sweet Sixteen in five years. In a rematch of the 2007 Sweet Sixteen, the Volunteers faced the Ohio State Buckeyes at the Edward Jones Dome in St. Louis. In a back and forth battle with the Evan Turner-led Buckeyes, Tennessee held a 76–73 lead with 13 seconds left. Turner missed a three-point shot, rebounded his own missed shot, and attempted a final three-point shot that was blocked by J. P. Prince, securing the Volunteers an appearance in the Elite Eight for the first time in program history. Tennessee faced Michigan State in the Elite Eight. After a fast start, the Vols sputtered in the second half and Michigan State was able to keep the game close. Down by one point with 11 seconds left, Tennessee's Scotty Hopson was set to attempt two free throws. He made the first but missed the second. With the score tied, Michigan State advanced the ball and was fouled on a fast break. Raymar Morgan made one of two free throws, and Michigan State was able to defeat Tennessee one game short of the Final Four. Tennessee opened the 2010–11 season with success, winning the Preseason NIT and rising as high as no. 7 in the national polls. In mid-December, the NCAA announced an investigation into Bruce Pearl for his role in a possible recruiting violation.[citation needed] SEC Commissioner Mike Slive suspended Pearl for the first half of the SEC season.[15] Tennessee faltered throughout the rest of the season to a 19–15 record. Tennessee appeared in the NCAA tournament for the sixth consecutive year under Pearl and faced Michigan in the opening round. The Volunteers were defeated 75–45 in what proved to be Pearl's last game. On March 21, 2011, the week after the loss, the university announced the firing of Pearl, based on Pearl's misconduct of lying to the NCAA in the ongoing investigation.[16] Pearl was eventually given a three-year show-cause penalty. On March 27, 2011, the University of Tennessee announced the hiring of Cuonzo Martin as the Volunteers' 18th head coach. Martin had spent the prior three seasons at Missouri State, where he compiled a record of 61–41. Martin was able to lead the Missouri State team from an 11–20 record and a last-place finish in the Missouri Valley Conference to a 26–9 record and a first-place conference finish. Martin took over a depleted roster with low expectations. After the departure of Tobias Harris following his freshman season, the Volunteers were picked to finish near the bottom of the SEC in 2011–12.[citation needed] With the emergence of Jordan McRae and Jeronne Maymon, and the mid-season addition of Jarnell Stokes, Martin took a team that had lost their top three—and seven of their top ten—contributors from the previous season to a second-place finish in the SEC, largely because of their tough defense and lack of turnovers. With an outside chance at the NCAA tournament, the Volunteers lost their first SEC tournament game to Ole Miss, ending their NCAA chances. They played in the NIT before losing in the second round. In 2012–13, the Volunteers started off slowly, posting an 11–10 record before finishing the regular season 8–1. UT was eliminated in the second round of the SEC Tournament and was left out of the NCAA tournament for the second straight year, finishing as one of the last teams out.[citation needed] Expectations were high heading into 2013–14 with a roster many felt could compete for a Sweet Sixteen appearance.[citation needed] However, the fans quickly grew vocally upset after another slow start of 16–11. A petition with thousands of signatures surfaced online for the firing of Cuonzo Martin and the re-hiring of Bruce Pearl, whose show-cause order was ending the next year.[citation needed] Whether the petition motivated the team or not, the Volunteers finished the season 5–1 and earned a place in the \"First Four\" round of the NCAA tournament. They defeated Iowa in the play-in game in Dayton, Ohio to move on to face the UMass Minutemen. Martin's Volunteers, who were the lower seed, were favored by many and easily defeated UMass. In one of the biggest upsets in tournament history, Mercer upset Duke, and the Volunteers went on to defeat Mercer to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. Tennessee then played Michigan in Indianapolis. In front of one of the largest crowds to witness a Sweet Sixteen game, the Volunteers' comeback fell short and UT lost to Michigan by a score of 73–71. Martin resigned from Tennessee and accepted the coaching job at California on April 15, 2014.[17] After a brief coaching search, Tennessee athletics director Dave Hart announced on April 21, 2014 that former Morehead State and Southern Mississippi head coach Donnie Tyndall would become the next head coach of the Tennessee Volunteers.[18] Tyndall inherited a roster that returned one contributing player from the previous year. Also, due to Jarnell Stokes's decision to enter the NBA draft and two other players transferring, Tyndall had to recruit and sign nearly one-third of the 2015 team's roster in less than a month. Under these circumstances, he led the 2015 team to a 16–16 record. After the season was over, Tennessee announced it was firing Tyndall with cause after it learned that he had lied to both UT and the NCAA about the severity of major NCAA violations that had occurred at Southern Miss.[19] Hart said that he would have never hired Tyndall had the true extent of the violations been known. By this time, it was clear that Tyndall would face severe penalties for his role in the violations, including a suspension for part of the season. According to ESPN, Hart and other officials were still smarting from Pearl having to sit out the first half of conference play three years earlier, and were not willing to face the prospect of an equally lengthy suspension for Tyndall.[20] While searching for its third basketball coach in four years, Tennessee sought to make a hire that would bring much-needed stability to the program.[citation needed] During the search process, news broke that Texas had fired their head coach of 17 years, Rick Barnes. Barnes, who had a prior connection to Tennessee athletics director Dave Hart, quickly surfaced as the frontrunner for the job.[citation needed] On March 31, 2015, Barnes was named the new Tennessee men's basketball coach. Barnes boasts the best record of any coach in school history, with an overall record of 604–314 from his previous tenures at Texas, Clemson, and Providence. Barnes is originally from nearby Hickory, North Carolina, and his wife, Candy, graduated from Tennessee in 1975.[21] The Rick Barnes era began on a winning note as Tennessee defeated UNC Asheville, 82–78 in Barnes' debut game at UT. In Barnes' third year as Tennessee's coach he completed quite the turnaround from the previous year's 16–16 (8–10) team, as his team would finish the regular season 26–9 (13–5) and capture a share of the SEC regular season title. This would be Tennessee's first regular season title since 2008 and tenth overall.[22] Tennessee also reached the SEC men's basketball championship final where they were defeated by Kentucky 77–72. In 2019, Tennessee experienced their best season record wise under Barnes. The Volunteers would earn a record of 31–6 (15–3) including an 18-game win streak and a no.1 ranking in the polls for the first time since the 2007–08 season. The Volunteers again reached the SEC men's basketball championship final where they were defeated by Auburn 84–64. The Volunteers proceeded to earn a #2 seed in the 2019 NCAA tournament, where they defeated Colgate 77–70 in the first round.[23] Tennessee overcame a resurgent Iowa Hawkeyes team in the second round by a score of 83–77 in an overtime thriller. The Volunteers fell to Purdue in the Sweet Sixteen in overtime after a thrilling come-from-behind run led by Volunteer guard Admiral Schofield. Purdue's Ryan Cline kept the Boilermakers in the game late and after a controversial call on Lamonte Turner, the Vols lost. Junior forward Grant Williams captured the 2018–19 SEC player of the year award, his second consecutive year obtaining the honor.[24] Source[25][26][27] National champion Postseason invitational champion Conference regular season champion Conference regular season and conference tournament champion Division regular season champion Division regular season and conference tournament champion Conference tournament champion Tennessee plays its home games in Thompson–Boling Arena, which was at one time the largest facility ever built specifically for basketball in the United States, with a seating capacity of 24,678 until its 2007 renovation. Named for the late B. Ray Thompson and former UT President Dr. Edward J. Boling, the arena regularly hosts women's volleyball matches, concerts, camps, conferences, and other special events throughout the year. Thompson–Boling Arena opened during the 1987–88 season, with Tennessee defeating Marquette 82–56 before a crowd of 25,272. In its opening season, the Volunteers finished third nationally in attendance, with an average attendance of more than 20,000 fans per game. Much of the facility's storied history has centered on men's and women's basketball. In the last two decades, the Volunteers and Lady Volunteers have hosted record college basketball crowds, as well as WNBA and NCAA tournament basketball games. The Volunteers have ranked fourth in the nation in average home attendance for each of the past three seasons, including an average of 20,483 fans per game in 2008–09. Tennessee's 1989 men's game against Kentucky set the SEC regular-season record with a crowd of 25,610. The Lady Volunteers drew 24,597 fans for their 1998 game with Connecticut to establish a women's NCAA record, while a Celtics-Bullets game in 1988 attracted a then-NBA-record exhibition crowd of 23,611. The arena's largest basketball crowd since its capacity was reduced to 21,678 prior to the 2007–08 season came on January 7, 2009, when the Vols hosted Gonzaga in front of a sellout crowd of 22,326. UT hosted the NCAA tournament's South Regional Finals in 1994 and 1999 in the spacious facility, as well as the 1990 NCAA Southeast Region's first- and second-round games and the NCAA women's 1990 Final Four. The 1989 SEC Tournament was the first of what promised to be many postseason tournaments to be held in Thompson–Boling Arena. The riverfront arena has drawn rave reviews from teams, administrators, and media for its modern facilities needed for hosting major tournaments. The Volunteers have appeared in the NCAA tournament 26 times. Their combined record is 28–27. The Volunteers have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 13 times. Their combined record is 13–13. †: First Team All-American Tennessee has retired five jersey numbers.[30][31][32][33][34]",

                "content": "Dennis Schröder (German pronunciation: [ˈdɛnɪs ˈʃʁøːdɐ]; born 15 September 1993)[1] is a German professional basketball player for the Brooklyn Nets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He previously played for SG Braunschweig and Phantoms Braunschweig in Germany, before joining the Atlanta Hawks for his first five seasons in the NBA. He is the sole owner of his German hometown team, Basketball Loewen Braunschweig of the Basketball Bundesliga, and had been the majority shareholder of the team since 2018.[2][3] Debuting for the German national team in 2014, Schröder helped the team to its first major medal in 17 years when Germany won bronze at the 2022 EuroBasket. In 2023, he led the national team to their first World Cup title at the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup while being named the FIBA World Cup MVP. The following year, Schröder was the flag bearer for Germany along with judoka Anna-Maria Wagner at 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.[4] He helped Germany to a fourth place finish and was named to the FIBA Olympics All-Star Five team. Schröder is the son of a German father and a Gambian mother, and has a brother and a younger sister. He and his brother were both heavily involved with skateboarding until he found basketball at age 11.[5][6] He started focusing on the latter career after his father died in 2009,[7] choosing to wear the jersey number 17 in his honor, as it was his favorite number.[1] His agent was former German basketball national player Ademola Okulaja.[8][9] Schröder started playing professional basketball in 2010 for SG Braunschweig, farm team of Phantoms Braunschweig. In his first season with SUM Baskets Braunschweig, he averaged 7.8 points, 2.1 assists and 1.6 rebounds per game in a second-tier German league. In the 2011–12 season he made a breakthrough, averaging 17.8 points and 6.7 assists over 23 regular-season games. His team went in the playoffs where he averaged 18.8 points and 5.1 assists over four games. In the same season, he also played 30 games for Phantoms Braunschweig of the German league, averaging 2.3 points, 0.7 assists and 0.8 rebounds in about 8 minutes per game.[10] In the 2012–13 season he played 32 games for Phantoms Braunschweig, averaging 12 points, 3.2 assists and 2.5 rebounds in 25 minutes per game.[11] For the season, he was named the League's Most Improved Player as well as Best Young German Player.[12] In 2013, Schröder was announced to play at the 2013 Nike Hoop Summit for the World Select Team. Before officially playing at the Nike Hoop Summit, Schröder decided to declare for the 2013 NBA draft.[citation needed] On 20 April 2013, Schröder led his team to a 112–98 win. He finished with 18 points, 6 assists and 2 rebounds in 29 minutes.[13] On 27 June 2013, Schröder was selected by the Atlanta Hawks with the 17th overall pick in the 2013 NBA draft. On 11 July 2013, he signed with the Hawks.[14] Schröder's minutes were cut due to frequent turnovers early in the season,[15] with Shelvin Mack taking over the second-string point guard.[16] He spent time in the NBA Development League in December, with the Bakersfield Jam,[17][18] and finished his rookie season playing in just 49 games for the Hawks, with 3.7 points in 13.1 minutes per game.[19] On 22 December 2014, Schröder scored a career-high 22 points in a 105–102 win over the Dallas Mavericks.[20] Schröder participated in the Rising Stars Challenge on 13 February 2015, recording 13 points, a game-high nine assists and three steals in Team World's 121–112 win over Team USA.[21][22] His performance was lauded by ESPN analysts as looking like a \"young Tony Parker\".[23] On 15 March 2015, he had 24 points and 10 assists in a 91–86 win over the Los Angeles Lakers.[24] Schröder had a \"breakout year\" in 2014–15,[25] increasing his averages to 10.0 points and 4.1 assists in 19.7 minutes per game, appearing in 77 regular season games with 10 starts.[26] Schröder continued to play behind All-Star Teague in 2015–16, making just six starts in 80 games. He averaged 11.0 points and 4.4 assists in 20.3 minutes per game,[27] shooting 42% from the field and 32% from 3-point range, leading to defenders often daring him to shoot the three.[25] On 20 February 2016, he recorded 25 points and 10 assists in a 117–109 overtime loss to the Milwaukee Bucks.[28] In Game 1 of the Hawks' second round playoff series against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Schröder scored a playoff career-high 27 points in a 104–93 loss.[29] On 26 October 2016, Schröder signed a four-year, $70 million contract extension with the Hawks.[30][31] He took the reins as the Hawks' lead guard in 2016–17 following Teague's trade to the Indiana Pacers.[32] On 8 November 2016, Schröder scored a then career-high 28 points in a 110–106 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers.[33] On 30 November 2016, he scored 14 of his career-high 31 points in the fourth quarter of the Hawks' 109–107 loss to the Phoenix Suns.[34] On 9 December 2016, he set a new career high with 33 points in a 114–110 win over the Milwaukee Bucks.[35] In Game 5 of the Hawks' first-round playoff series against the Washington Wizards, Schröder led the Hawks with 29 points, making a career-high-tying five 3s, and 11 assists in a 103–99 loss.[36] On 23 December 2017, Schröder matched his career high with 33 points, including 27 in the second half, to help the Hawks beat the Dallas Mavericks 112–107.[37] On 12 January 2018, he scored a career-high 34 points in a 110–105 loss to the Brooklyn Nets.[38] On 20 March 2018, he set a new career high with 41 points in a 99–94 win over the Utah Jazz.[39] On 25 July 2018, Schröder was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder in a three-team deal involving the Hawks and the Philadelphia 76ers.[40] In his first season in Oklahoma, he was positioned as the team's sixth man, coming off the bench behind superstar point guard Russell Westbrook. In his debut for the Thunder in their season opener on 16 October, Schröder recorded 21 points, eight rebounds, six assists and three steals in a 108–100 loss to the Golden State Warriors.[41] On 7 November, he scored a then season-high 28 points in a 95–86 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers.[42] On 21 November, he scored a season-high 32 points off the bench in a 123–95 win over the Warriors.[43][44] On 1 February 2019, he scored 24 of his 28 points in the second quarter of the Thunder's 118–102 win over the Miami Heat.[45] On 3 March, he recorded 17 points and a career-high 11 rebounds in a 99–95 win over the Memphis Grizzlies.[46] His second season with the team saw him in the role of the sixth man yet again, this time behind veteran All-Star point guard Chris Paul and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. Schröder led the league in scoring off the bench with 18.9 points per game, while shooting a career-high 46.9% from the field, including 38.5% on 3-point field goals. He finished as the runner-up to Montrezl Harrell in voting for the NBA Sixth Man of the Year.[47] On 18 November 2020, Schröder was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for Danny Green and the draft rights to first-round pick Jaden McDaniels.[48] On 22 December 2020, Schröder made his Lakers debut, putting up 14 points, 12 rebounds, and eight assists, in a 116–109 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers.[49] At the end of March 2021, there were rumors that he rejected the Lakers' contract extension offer of four years, $84 million to pursue a larger deal in the off-season as an unrestricted free agent which he later clarified that it was not true.[50][51][52] He was sidelined twice during the season due to the league's COVID-19 health protocols, including missing seven games late in the season.[51][53] Schröder started 61 games during the regular season, averaging 15.4 points and 5.8 assists per games and shooting 43.7% shooting from the field and 33.5% on 3-pointers. His numbers dropped in the playoffs to 14.3 points and 2.8 assists while shooting 40.3% from the field and 31.9% from three-point range, and the Lakers were eliminated in six games by Phoenix.[50][51] During the off-season, the Lakers traded for point guard Russell Westbrook, signaling that the Lakers would inevitably be moving on from Schröder.[54] On 13 August 2021, Schröder signed with the Boston Celtics, on a one-year, $5.9 million taxpayer mid-level exception contract.[51][55] The Celtics, who had recently moved on from starting point guard Kemba Walker via trade earlier in the off-season, were in search of backcourt depth and Schröder fit the bill at a much-discounted price than his rumored $84 million contract extension with the Lakers during the 2020–21 season.[56] Schröder chose to wear number 71 with the Celtics as his usual number 17 had been retired by the Celtics in honor of John Havlicek.[57] He became only the fourth-known player in the history of the league to wear the number 71 and the first since McCoy McLemore in 1965.[58] On 10 February 2022, Schröder was traded, along with Enes Freedom and Bruno Fernando, to the Houston Rockets in exchange for Daniel Theis.[59] On 29 March, Schröder was ruled out for the remainder of the season with a shoulder injury.[60] On 16 September 2022, the Los Angeles Lakers signed Schröder to a one-year, $2.64 million deal for his return to the team. Schröder chose the Lakers over the Toronto Raptors and Phoenix Suns citing \"unfinished business\" with the Lakers.[61][62][63] After completing his first practice on his second stint with the team, he claimed during the media interviews that the Lakers never offered him a four-year, $84 million contract extension that he was eligible to sign during the previous free agency before the start of the 2021–22 NBA season.[52] Schröder scored 14 of his season-high 32 points in the fourth quarter to lead the Lakers to a 112–109 win over the Miami Heat during their regular season game on 4 January 2023.[64] and on 20 January 2023, he put up 19 points, eight rebounds, eight assists, and made a game-winning layup in a 122–121 win over the Memphis Grizzlies.[65] Schröder was also a big factor in the Lakers struggling return to the playoffs after missing last year's playoffs. During their hard-fought play-in game on 11 April 2023 against the Minnesota Timberwolves, Dennis scored 21 points on 41.7% field goal shooting, along with 75% three-point shooting, making three out of four three-pointers which includes a clutch tiebreaking corner three-point shot off a kick out pass from superstar teammate LeBron James, following a drive on the opposite side with 1.4 seconds remaining in the regulation. He almost had a game-winner and the Lakers were up by three. However, his other superstar teammate Anthony Davis fouled Minnesota's veteran point guard Mike Conley Jr. on a catch-and-shoot, corner three-point, game-tying attempt with 0.1 seconds remaining. Conley Jr. made all of the free throws to tie the game and send it to overtime. But eventually, the Lakers still won the game as Schröder iced the win with two free throws with 8.4 seconds left in overtime, clinching the 7th seed in the Western Conference and successfully securing a spot in the 2023 NBA playoffs.[66] On 30 June 2023, Schröder signed a two-year, $26 million contract with the Toronto Raptors.[67] The deal took up Toronto's entire mid-level exception allowing the organization about $8.7 million below the luxury tax threshold.[68] It was Dennis' sixth team as he entered his tenth season in the NBA.[69] On 25 October 2023, Schröder made his Raptors debut, putting up 22 points and seven assists in a 97–94 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves.[70] On 13 December 2023, after a 135-128 win against the Atlanta Hawks, in which he had recorded 17 points, seven assists, and 3 rebounds, along with a block and a steal, Schröder achieved 10,000 career points.[71] On 8 February 2024, Schröder was traded alongside Thaddeus Young to the Brooklyn Nets in exchange for Spencer Dinwiddie.[72] On 10 February, Schröder made his Nets debut, putting up 15 points and 12 assists in a 123–103 win over the San Antonio Spurs.[73] Schröder has been a member of the German national under-18 and German national under-20 teams. He played in the 2012 FIBA Europe Under-20 Championship and helped the German team to fifth place, averaging 6.1 points, 2 assists and 1.8 rebounds in 14.6 minutes on the court. On 27 July 2014, he made his debut for the senior Germany national basketball team in a game against Finland.[74] Schröder played at EuroBasket 2015, in the group stage that was hosted in Berlin. Germany did not qualify for the knock-out stage and finished on the 18th place in the final rankings. He returned for EuroBasket 2017, leading Germany to the quarterfinals and averaging a team-high 23.7 points and 5.6 assists per game.[75] Schröder had expressed a desire to play for Germany at the 2020 Summer Olympics; however, the German Basketball Federation was unable to meet the financial insurance requirements.[76] He returned to EuroBasket 2022 and led Germany to third place,[77] being named to the EuroBasket All-Tournament Team in the process.[78] The run included a famous win over Greece in the quarterfinals, which had Giannis Antetokounmpo on the roster. Schröder averaged team highs of 22.1 points and 7.1 assists per game.[79] Schröder led the German national team to their first World Cup title at the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup. The team went undefeated, defeating top-ranked teams such as Australia and the United States. After the final between Germany and Serbia, he was named FIBA World Cup MVP and to the FIBA Basketball World Cup All-Tournament Team, averaging 17.9 points and 6.7 assists per game.[80] At 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, Schröder was the flag bearer for Germany along with judoka Anna-Maria Wagner.[4] After going unbeaten in Group B and winning Greece in the quarterfinals, Germany lost to France, 69–73, in the semifinals. In the bronze medal game, Germany lost to Serbia 83–93. For his play, Schröder was named to the FIBA Olympics All-Star Five team.[81] Schröder is married and has three children.[82] Schröder became known earlier in his career for his \"signature\" patch of bleached blonde hair which he adopted upon leaving Germany for the United States.[83][84][85] It came at the suggestion of his mother who thought it would help people to recognize him in public.[86] Schröder is a devout Muslim.[1][87] He prays before games and before going to sleep.[1] Schröder is a teetotaler and has never consumed alcohol in his life.[1] Schröder missed games on two different occasions due to COVID-19 protocols in place. In May 2021, he said that he was the only Lakers player who had not been vaccinated against the disease.[88] After the Nets were eliminated from the 2024 playoffs, Schröder joined FC Germania Bleckenstedt soccer team of the German Landesliga Braunschweig.[89]",

                "content": "Blue Bloods was an American police procedural drama television series that aired on CBS from September 24, 2010 until December 13, 2024, across 14 seasons and 293 episodes. Its main characters were members of the fictional Reagan family, an American, Irish Catholic family in New York City with a history of work in law enforcement. Blue Bloods starred Tom Selleck as New York City Police Commissioner Frank Reagan; other main cast members include Donnie Wahlberg, Bridget Moynahan, Will Estes and Len Cariou for all 14 seasons, plus Amy Carlson (seasons 1–7), Sami Gayle (seasons 1–10) as well as Marisa Ramirez (regular since season 4) and Vanessa Ray (regular since season 5). The show was filmed on location in New York City with references to suburban areas as well.[1][2] Selleck has called the New York City setting \"another character\" on the show.[3][4][5] The series debuted on September 24, 2010,[6] with episodes airing on Fridays following CSI: NY before being moved to Wednesdays at 10:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific time and 9:00 p.m. Central and Mountain time for a four-week tryout. After four weeks, it returned to its original Friday 10:00 p.m. Eastern time slot, where it has remained since. On March 29, 2023, CBS announced the show had been renewed for a fourteenth season, with the cast and producers reportedly taking a pay cut to secure the renewal.[7][8] On July 21, 2023, CBS announced the renewed fourteenth season would be delayed and on hold due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.[9] On November 20, 2023, it was announced that the fourteenth season would be its last.[10] The first ten episodes of the season began airing on February 16, 2024,[11] while the rest of the season, consisting of eight episodes,[10] premiered on October 18, 2024.[12] The series finale aired on December 13, 2024.[13] The series follows the Reagan family, with a long history of policing in New York. Frank Reagan (Tom Selleck) is the New York Police Department Police Commissioner, a post his father also held. Frank's eldest surviving son, Danny (Donnie Wahlberg), is an NYPD detective and his youngest son, Jamie (Will Estes), is an NYPD sergeant who graduated from Harvard University; his daughter, Erin (Bridget Moynahan), works as a New York city assistant district attorney. Frank's second birth son, Joe (the series mistakenly refers to him as the eldest in later episodes), was murdered by a corrupt cop in the line of duty in events that predate the series, when he was involved with an FBI investigation of a group of corrupt NYPD cops known as the Blue Templar. Frank's father, Henry (Len Cariou), is a former NYPD beat cop who rose through the ranks to become police commissioner. The show's title references both the \"blue-blooded\" concept of nobility as it relates to the Reagan family's powerful roles within New York's criminal justice system as well as an entire family who dedicate their lives to law enforcement, one that \"bleeds blue\" to match the blue color of NYPD uniforms. Each member of the family represents a different aspect of police work or the legal process: Frank as the commissioner, Danny as the detective, Jamie as the beat cop, and Erin as the prosecutor. Additionally, while each person's story might occasionally interweave with another's, the show also follows the professional and, at times, personal relationships with their respective partners and colleagues: Frank with Garrett Moore (Gregory Jbara), the NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Public Information and de facto Chief of Staff, Detective 1st Grade Abigail Baker (Abigail Hawk), the primary aide to the commissioner, and later, Lieutenant Sidney Gormley (Robert Clohessy), the Special Assistant to the Commissioner and de facto Chief of department; Danny with Detective Jackie Curatola (Jennifer Esposito) and later, Detective Maria Baez (Marisa Ramirez); Jamie with Officer Edit \"Eddie\" Janko (Vanessa Ray); and Erin with Detective Anthony Abetemarco (Steven Schirripa), who is an investigator for the DA's office. Both Henry's and Frank's respective wives, Betty and Mary, are deceased, as is Frank's second son, Joe. Erin is divorced and has one daughter, college graduate Nicky (Sami Gayle), who lived with her mother until accepting a job in San Francisco in season 10. Danny is a widower with two sons, Jack and Sean. He was married to Linda (Amy Carlson), a nurse who was killed off-screen in a helicopter crash between seasons 7 and 8. Jamie married his partner, Edit \"Eddie\" Janko, in the season 9 finale. They acknowledged their mutual attraction during season 7 and became engaged at the end of season 8. The season 10 finale reveals a son of Joe's, a fact unknown to himself and the family until the revelation. He's a 24-year-old detective in the firearms unit named Joe Hill (played by Will Hochman).[14][15] The Reagans are an Irish-American Catholic family that gathers for Sunday dinner each week. According to People, \"the Sunday supper is the heart of each show.\"[16] The dinner scene was the first scene filmed as part of the pilot episode.[17][18] Original series executive producer Leonard Goldberg has said he was inspired by the Norman Rockwell Freedom from Want painting to combine the themes of a police drama and family.[19][20] \"The show is about the moments between these people...you'll remember the small moments between characters,” he said at the time of the show's premiere at the Paley Center.[21] As an Episcopalian, Selleck said he got instruction from Moynahan on how to properly cross himself when playing Catholic character Frank Reagan.[22] Selleck valued that the show was character-driven[23] and not a \"pure procedural\" and recalled former CBS executive Nina Tassler saying that \"We don't use the ‘P’ word around your show.” [24] He has said that the experience of former NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton has influenced his performance.[25][26] Wahlberg said an interview that he was drawn to the Blue Bloods role after his experience playing an NYPD detective in a 2005 NBC TV pilot NY70 set in the 1970s that was not picked up.[27][28] In the pilot episode stage, the series was originally called \"Reagan's Law,\" and some of the characters originally had different first names.[29][30][31] According to Deadline Hollywood, the Blue Bloods pilot was a \"dark horse\" that made it on to the CBS schedule due to a strong audience response during test screenings.[32][33][34][35] Both Selleck and Wahlberg said they saw benefits in low expectations for the Friday night timeslot, as Wahlberg told the New York Post: \"We don't have the pressure other shows have. On Friday night, we have time to build an audience. And we did that.\"[36][37] Selleck played a key role in bringing together and encouraging the three cast members who came to form his character's core inner circle at 1 Police Plaza by season 5.[38][39] In a 2024 feature for Emmy Magazine, Wahlberg recalled helping to convince Moynahan to take the role as his sister after previously working with her on an unsuccessful TV pilot called Bunker Hill.[40] He also encouraged Ramirez to stay on beyond the initial season 3 episode she came on to in a guest role.[41] Selleck mentioned that he was drawn to the project because of the strong pilot script and that he was concerned about becoming involved in an ongoing series because he did not want to compromise his commitment to the Jesse Stone television movies.[55] Beginning January 19, 2011, Blue Bloods was moved to Wednesdays at 10 p.m. for a four-week tryout.[56] In February 2011, the series returned to its Friday night time slot due to the series premiere of Criminal Minds: Suspect Behavior. Kevin Wade became showrunner of the series after the initial creators and a previous showrunner exited the series in 2011 over creative differences with Selleck, and supported by other main cast members, over balancing the character-driven and procedural aspects of the show.[57][58][59][60][35] Series music composer Mark Snow said there was tension between him and the show's original creators over the use of music to underscore dialogue since they did not have experience incorporating music in that way from their previous work on The Sopranos.[61] Director David Barrett explained how he developed a framework for filming the character in different ways to emphasize their character traits that he conveyed to other directors. \"This show is a painting, and each storyline is a color to this painting, so let's approach it from a cinematic rhythm, if you will.\"[62] Showrunner Kevin Wade emphasized that the show didn't seek to be a \"soap box\" to promote one point of view, but aimed to give equal airing to opposing views on law enforcement issues.[63][64][65][23] Both writer producers Brian Burns and Siobhan Byrne O'Connor have family ties to law enforcement.[66][67] Former NYPD officer James Nuciforo has been the technical advisor for the series since the first season, and also has a recurring on-screen role as part of Frank Reagan's security detail.[68][69][70] In 2012, a scene with Tom Selleck was the first production permitted to film at the 9/11 Memorial after it opened in 2011.[71][72] In the United Kingdom, the show helped launch Sky Atlantic by premiering on Tuesday, February 1, 2011, at 10:30 p.m.[73] In Australia, the show premiered in February 2011 in a primetime Wednesday slot on Network Ten, then from February 2013 for season two was moved from the network's primary SD channel to its HD channel One alongside White Collar, then on August 26, 2013, the show moved back to the primary SD channel on Mondays for season three. In New Zealand, the show premieres on July 13, 2013, on TV3 replacing CSI: NY in a primetime Saturday slot after Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. On October 20, 2012, CBS announced that Jennifer Esposito was being dropped from the series, with her character, Detective Curatola, being placed on indefinite leave of absence.[74] Esposito and CBS had been at odds over her limited availability for work after the actress was diagnosed with celiac disease. She had missed a week after collapsing on set earlier in the season. According to Esposito, CBS challenged her request for a reduced work schedule, and further, kept her from finding work elsewhere.[74] In a press release from CBS, the network said that Esposito had \"informed us that she is only available to work on a very limited part-time schedule. As a result, she's unable to perform the demands of her role and we regretfully had to put her character on a leave of absence.\"[74] Esposito's last appearance in a \"starring role\" as Curatola was in the season three episode \"Nightmares,\" though she did later reprise her role as a guest star in the final episode of season thirteen, \"Forgive Us Our Trespasses\", and appeared again in season fourteen. Amy Carlson was written out of the show after she opted not to renew her contract after season 7.[75][76] Tony Terraciano departed from his weekly recurring role[77] in season 9 to focus on his college studies, while still making occasional guest appearances.[78] Regarding Sami Gayle's character of Nicky, Showrunner Kevin Wade said that in later seasons the show didn't \"have the real estate to tell Nicky stories\" once the character \"aged out\" after graduating from college and moving to San Francisco, also aside from occasional guest appearances.[79] Wahlberg said that after they watched the pilot episode together, Selleck told him: \"I'm really good at making scripts better, I notice that you are too, and I'm going to count on you to keep running through walls and do what you do for the run of this show.\"[80][81] Particularly in the first season, Wahlberg said he snuck references to song titles from his band New Kids on the Block into his dialogue, while band member Jordan Knight appeared as a background extra in a later episode.[82] Both Wahlberg and Moynahan have directed episodes of the series.[83][84][85][86] Co-star Gregory Jbara said in an interview that Selleck tended to focus on efficiently getting through the day's scenes, which he contrasted with a looser atmosphere in other scenes, such as with Wahlberg.[87] Co-star Steve Schirripa said that while he just focused on his performance, Moynahan, Wahlberg and Selleck were also interested in production aspects of the show.[88] Wahlberg has contrasted his acting approach with Selleck's, saying \"We both approach the show with the same level of commitment, but Tom is very focused and reserved and uses his years of experience in the craft, while I use instinct and feeling, and emotion a lot.\"[89] He also said of working with Selleck: \"It can never be overstated how much he's committed to the show. He stays behind and works on the show in post-production. He works on the scripts before they're even brought to the cast.\"[90] Co-star Amy Carlson said of working with Wahlberg in 2011: \"When he works on this show, he is Emmy material. He lives this character in such a visceral way, it really resonates on the screen.\"[91] Moynahan added that \"Tom is the face of the show, but Donnie is the engine that keeps everything going.\"[91] The show marked its 150th episode in 2017 with a cast panel discussion at the 92nd Street Y.[92] When filming of the end of the 10th season was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Wahlberg hosted cast members for a \"virtual\" family dinner that was streamed online.[93][94] Core cast members were featured on the cover of TV Guide magazine in March 2022 to mark the show's 250th episode.[95][96] The show has been featured on the cover of TV Guide Magazine twelve times, most frequently featuring Tom Selleck by himself or with other cast members, and Donnie Wahlberg by himself in 2023.[97] An October 2024 edition of the magazine featured four separate covers of Blue Bloods cast members to mark the second half of the 14th season, including Selleck with Len Cariou, Donnie Wahlberg with Marisa Ramirez, Will Estes with Vanessa Ray and Bridget Moynahan by herself,[98] in addition to a special farewell edition.[99] In a video about the two 2024 TV Guide covers, Wahlberg in particular praised Ramirez for making her own mark on the show in taking over the role as his character's partner, remarking that \"now everyone wants these two to be a couple, because she's so awesome.\"[100][101] The cast participated in a panel discussion at the Paley Center to mark the premiere of the 14th Season,[102] after previously participating in Paley panels for the series premiere in 2010 and participating in subsequent panels in 2014 and 2017.[103][104][105] According to TV by the Numbers, by committing itself to a third season of Blue Bloods, CBS all but guaranteed a fourth season,[106] because, as a CBS Television Studios production, CBS had a financial incentive to produce at least the minimum number of episodes needed for stripped syndication.[106] On March 27, 2013, CBS made it official by renewing Blue Bloods for a fourth season to begin in the fall of 2013.[107] As of 2023, the show has been renewed through season 14, with the cast and producers taking a pay cut to help secure a 14th season.[108][109][110][111][112][113][114][115][8] On November 20, 2023, it was reported that the fourteenth season is going to be the series's final season, with the first 10 episodes begin airing February 16, 2024, and the remaining eight in the fall of 2024, with producers including Selleck having pushed the network for the extension beyond the spring for the additional episodes in the fall.[10][116][117][35] The second half of the final season premiered on October 18, 2024[12] and the series finale aired on December 13, 2024.[13] In a February 2024 podcast interview, Gregory Jbara said it was possible the show could be extended to the spring 2025 season and beyond 300 episodes depending on viewership and initiative by Tom Selleck.[118] Fans started an initiative to save the show with a social media hashtag, a petition, a letter writing campaign and in person signs on location, and cited Wahlberg's comments in a February 2024 Entertainment Tonight interview: \"Cancel the Cancellation! The fans want us to keep going. The cast want to keep going. Cancel the Cancel!\"[119][better source needed][120][121][122][123][124] Wahlberg paid tribute to the fans' efforts during his regular live-tweeting during the airing of the show and in an Instagram video featuring other cast members.[125][better source needed][126][better source needed] In interviews with CBS News in May 2024 during production of the second half of season 14, Selleck said \"I will continue to think that CBS will come to their senses\" and that \"all the cast wants to come back,\" comments he repeated at the end of May.[127][128][better source needed] He also said that \"when they choose to end it, I think is debatable.\"[129] He also told Entertainment Tonight \"I'm gonna stay optimistic because everybody on the show wants to do it.\"[130] On June 4, 2024, Paramount Global co-CEO Brian Robbins said at a shareholder presentation that there were plans for a \"franchise extension\" of Blue Bloods.[131] In a February 2024 appearance on the Kelly Clarkson Show, Wahlberg had stated that \"maybe there's some way it will still end up surviving and carrying on in a different way.\"[132][133] Also in February 2024, showrunner Kevin Wade had suggested in an interview that \"I think there is some idea on the part of the current CBS to maybe [explore] a 'Blue Bloods 2.0.'''[134] After negotiations over a merger between Paramount Global with Skydance Media initially collapsed in June 2024, a Deadline Hollywood column evaluating the company's possible future plans noted that the show's \"Tom Selleck-led cast is kicking and screaming to stop the show from fading away at season's end. Blue Bloods might not be a sexy Emmy magnet like Succession, but it has made a lot more money.\"[135] In reviewing TV ratings for the 2024 season, Deadline called the cancellation \"one of the bigger head scratchers\" given the show's average audience of over 8 million viewers in 7-day ratings, noting that it \"still does better than The Equalizer (7.7 million) and Fire Country (7.1 million),\" both of which were renewed.[136] In comments livestreamed and recorded after production completed on season 14 in June 2024, Wahlberg recalled the disruption during the COVID-19 pandemic and stated that \"God willing, we'll get some more time together to do something magical again ... I pray that that can happen in one way or another, I won't give up trying.\"[137][138] He wrote on Instagram in the days after filming that the show was one \"that I know so many of us, and so many of you, wish could continue.\"[139][better source needed] In July 2024, Wahlberg hinted to fans of his band New Kids on the Block that he might be involved in some sort of follow-up to the series after its \"apparent\" final season.[140] In an interview before the airing of the second half of season 14, Wahlberg confirmed he would be interested in spin-off ideas.[141] He also said the week of the fall Season 14 premiere on Watch What Happens Live that \"there could be some spin-off or off-shoot\",[142] a possibility he hinted at again in social media posts ahead of the end of Season 14.[143] He told US Weekly in a video interview that he hasn't \"closed the door on the character or on somehow if there is something for Danny, somehow incorporating some of the Reagans into that too and some of the other characters from Blue Bloods.\"[144] For Entertainment Weekly, he outlined an \"alternative ending\" for his character that could involve another cast member and some appearances from other family members, and suggested it could be a \"tease for a spin-off.\"[145] In other interviews the week of the Season 14 finale, Wahlberg said a spin-off was \"under discussion\" and that he would be \"open to carrying on the character\" under the right circumstances.[146][147] Marisa Ramirez told Latin American news outlets that filming the end of season 14 was sad and emotional and that the cast and crew \"want to continue, we want more,\" and that she \"would love to continue giving life to Maria [Baez] for another 15 years.\"[148][149][150] She said she would be open to a spin-off involving her character. \"I would never turn down something like that. It would be a blessing, which I would accept with open arms.\"[151] Abigail Hawk, who was a cast member since the first season,[152] said in October 2024 that \"none of us wanted the show to end. Every single one of us, regardless of whatever rumors were flying around, was very ready, willing, and able to continue working. Most especially Tom and Len [Cariou].\"[153] She added that \"we all wanted to continue, this is not something any of us wanted. We felt that there was so much more we could continue telling and sharing and creating.\"[154] In a separate October 2024 interview Hawk said that \"I think there's always hope that once ... these final episodes start airing CBS may go you know even though like the set's gone, the props are gone but like that those things can be rebuilt and if you have the entire cast and crew totally ready and willing to continue I think it's possible that the conversation may happen. I'm not saying it's probable but I think it's possible.\"[155][156] She also told Hello Magazine: \"Now I think once these episodes start airing, CBS executives may realize that they have made a colossal error and perhaps rethink down the line so I think [continuation] remains possible,\" adding that \"hope floats, and I think it's necessary to have something to hang on to and we would all certainly drop everything and make that happen\" and that \"there are more stories to be told.\"[157] She acknowledged that \"yes the set is gone, but with the professionals we have in our industry it would take two seconds to rebuild a set like that if it came to that\" and that \"there's still a little teeny bit of a silver needle somewhere in the hope haystack and I'll hang on to it,\" and cited the title of Selleck's recent memoir being You Never Know.\"There's a void left by our show. And I think that, in time, the higher-ups will come to regret it ... I would say that every single one of us as far as the cast is concerned, we are all ready and willing and able to work, to continue.\"[158] Moynahan said following the filming of season 14 that cast and crew still felt \"disappointed\" by the cancellation decision and recalled Selleck returning to set for the season's final filming day of scenes with her and Wahlberg after completing his own season 14 filming days earlier.[159][160] Selleck, who flew back to New York from California to be on set for the final season 14 filming day, said at the end of season 14 that he was \"frustrated\" about the cancellation decision, noting the show's continued ratings success that he felt was taken for granted, and reiterated that \"there isn't a single one of [the actors] who didn't want to come back.\"[161] Selleck told Variety in December 2024 that \"I can’t figure out why they didn’t start streaming it, do 10 episodes a year ... Everybody wanted to come back. And I think with this cast, it would have been a gift for the audience.\"[35] Selleck told Entertainment Weekly that \"somebody may be able to tell me someday why CBS wanted to end it, but I haven't had a good answer yet.\"[162] Asked about participation in a possible spin-off, Selleck said he was \"open to suggestions because I love Frank Reagan,\" but added that he did not see the character retiring and going off to a small town.[163] Wahlberg said in December 2024 he and other cast members still have the feeling of \"hoping someone from ‘Blue Bloods’ is chasing me down the street saying, ‘Wait, we’re going to do one more season'\" and added that \"“until we know that there’s absolutely no way this show can be resurrected somehow, I think we’re all walking forward… but taking a peek back.”[35] The TV Ratings Guide wrote in November 2024 that it was \"surprising\" that CBS hadn't yet officially announced development of some sort of Blue Bloods continuation given the show's continued ratings success, and noted the possibility of some sort of a follow-up similar to Criminal Minds: Evolution, which had previously been suggested by a writer for Precinct TV.[164][165] A house in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, is used for exterior shots of the Reagan home,[166] with interior scenes filmed at soundstages in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.[167] Visitors to the set have included President Bill Clinton[168][169][better source needed][170][better source needed] and Mayor Eric Adams[171][172][better source needed] and Congressmember Peter King.[173][174][175] Then-New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman made a guest appearance as himself in a 2016 episode.,[176][177][178] while former New York City Mayor David Dinkins appeared as himself in a 2018 episode.[179] President Kennedy's grandson Jack Schlossberg acted in a brief cameo role as a police officer in the 2018 season 8 finale.[180] The series received $79 million in tax breaks from the state of New York for its seasons four through seven.[181] The series received a citation on behalf of New York Governor Kathy Hochul for its contribution to the state's economy over 14 seasons.[182][better source needed][183][better source needed] The Empire State Building was lit blue by the cast to mark the premiere of the second half of season 14 on October 18, 2024, in partnership with CBS and the Detective Endowments Association Widows' and Children's Fund.[184][185] In Australia, the series premiered on Network Ten's primary channel on February 2, 2011.[186] Due to poor ratings of the first season, Ten moved the series to its HD channel One, which premiered the second season on October 31, 2011.[187] Due to decreased viewership of Ten's primary channel, season three moved back from August 26, 2013,[188] and season four returned on March 17, 2014.[189] Foxtel channel TV HITS (styled TV H!TS) have started airing the series from episode 1, weeknights at 8:30 pm AEST as of March 20. In Canada, new episodes air on CTV and are available for free for one week after the original air date on the CTV app.[190] In New Zealand, the series premiered on TV3 on July 13, 2013. In Ireland, all series have been shown on RTÉ, which is the national broadcaster for the Republic of Ireland. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, Sky Atlantic premiered the series on February 1, 2011,[191] with season two returning on October 4, 2011,[191] season three on December 13, 2012,[191] and season four on November 28, 2013.[192] Season five premiered on January 21, 2015.[193] From season 9 new episodes of Blue Bloods moved to Sky Witness and have aired weekly.[194] It is also available on Paramount Plus in the UK up to Season 10.[195] The series has also been broadcast throughout the Arabic-speaking market through MBC Action. In fall 2023 as a result of the Hollywood strikes, CBS reaired \"classic\" episodes based on input from fans on social media, including the season 12 episode \"Be Smart or Be Dead,\" the season 5 finale, the season 11 episode \"Happy Endings,\" the season 10 episode \"The Fog of War,\" the season 8 finale, the Season 9 finale, the season 4 episode \"To Protect and Serve,\" the season 10 finale, the season 11 finale and the season 1 finale.[196][197] Every episode is available to stream on Paramount+ in the U.S., while seasons 1 through 9 are also available on Hulu.[198][199][200] Reruns of Blue Bloods air nationally in the United States on Wednesdays on Ion Television, although it was briefly removed from the schedule in early 2020. NewsNation previously aired the show daily with a marathon of episodes beginning July 4, 2022, after the show had aired on predecessor channel WGN America.[201] Up TV began airing the program with episodes every weeknight. Blue Bloods has also reaired on Sundance TV and We TV.[202][203] CBS Media Ventures currently distributes the series to local outlets on weekends, with two episodes being offered. Free streaming service Pluto TV launched a Blue Bloods channel in the U.S. in 2023.[204][205] Repeats of Blue Bloods air on Pick (2018, showing only 2 seasons) and 5USA (currently showing in 2023) in the United Kingdom. The show airs twice a day on TV 2 Charlie in Denmark. One early review of the pilot from Hitfix praised the show's commitment to filming in New York City and suggested it could flourish if allowed to develop like The Good Wife and to be more character-driven than procedural.[206] For the first season, the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 84% approval rating, with an average rating of 7.3/10 and based on 31 reviews. The website's consensus reads: \"Blue Bloods features charismatic performances from Donnie Wahlberg and Tom Selleck, intriguing plotlines, and compelling doses of family drama within its police procedural trappings.\"[207] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 70 out of 100 based on 25 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[208] Reviewers have praised the series' on-location shooting.[209] The New York Daily News praised Selleck's performance as Frank Reagan[209] while also praising the family dinner scenes for discussion of morally complex issues.[209] The Daily News drew comparisons between Selleck's characters Jesse Stone and Frank Reagan, saying that both Reagan and Stone are moral, principled men of few words.[209] In Entertainment Weekly's annual Fall TV Preview, Ken Tucker named Blue Bloods one of the \"5 Best New Shows\" of 2010.[210][failed verification] In late 2014, the magazine Slate's Laura Hudson criticized the show downplaying or apologizing for systemic racism in law enforcement.[211] Similarly, in a 2022 episode of Last Week Tonight, John Oliver compared the show to an \"adult Paw Patrol\" and criticized it for perpetuating the myth that police officers could overdose on fentanyl after merely touching it, using clips from a 2017 episode of the show.[212][213] In 2017, Selleck was nominated for a People's Choice Award for Favorite TV Crime Drama Actor for his work on the show.[214] In 2011, Michael Hann, writing for The Guardian, panned the show by calling it \"predictable\", \"trite\" and \"pisspoor\".[215] As part of its Performer of the Week series, TV Line praised Donnie Wahlberg's performance in the premiere of season eight[216] the performances of Tom Selleck and Will Hochman in the season 13 episode \"Nothing Sacred\"[217] and Marisa Ramirez's performance in the season 11 premiere.[218] Some critics called on CBS to rethink its 14th season cancellation decision. Verne Gay of Newsday wrote that \"CBS has made a blunder because network TV – approaching mortality itself, and that veritable glue factory – needs shows that are beloved, needs shows about faith, needs shows about New York City, and cops, and the messy political-judicial-socioeconomic ties that bind them. Fourteen years in, Blue Bloods is still that show.\"[219] In an opinion piece published in the Washington Examiner, Jesse Adams wrote that, \"In this atomized age, with more and more viewers lonely and isolated, the Reagans and company feel more like a lot of people's real family than their actual relations... As a sign of respect, and a lucrative opportunity to syndicate some more episodes, let's hope CBS sees reason and greenlights season 15 for a proper farewell.\"[220] Jack Ori wrote for Screen Rant that Tom Selleck was right to be frustrated about CBS' decision to end the show given the ratings and its close-knit cast.[221] The pilot episode garnered 15.258 million viewers because of the Live + 7 days after with viewings from DVRs. Without the DVR adding to the live viewing the show's debut episode garnered a total of 13.02 million viewers.[222] Overall, the ratings have been steady for the series, after the pilot episode. The lowest viewer total through the first seven seasons was 8.88 million in episode eight of season seven (which ran against Game 3 of the 2016 World Series); it was one of the few episodes through the first seven seasons that had fewer than 9 million initial-broadcast viewers.[223] The second-season finale on May 11, 2012, was watched by 10.73 million viewers and received a 1.2/4 ratings/share among adults ages 18–49.[224] The highest (non-pilot) live viewership of 12.93 million occurred in episode 14 of season four (\"Manhattan Queens\"), which was the series' 81st episode.[225] In January 2013, CBS announced via press release that Blue Bloods was the first scripted Friday series in 10 years to average at least 13 million viewers (live + 7), gaining eight percent more viewers than the previous year. The second season of CSI in 2001 had 14.78 million viewers, while the fourth season of Law & Order: SVU in 2003 had 14.92 million.[226] From season eight onward, ratings have declined. Season nine was the first season with no episodes reaching 10 million first-run viewers, although Blue Bloods still ranked as the eighth most watched program in 2018–19 Live + 7 viewership. Season nine also saw the lowest first-run viewership for any episode to date (7.62 million for episode 14, \"My Brother's Keeper\").[227] For the first half of season 14, it ranked at number six for scripted series in all viewers in Live + 7 ratings with an average of 8.4 million viewers and was one of the shows to average more than 10 million viewers after 35 days of viewing including on streaming platforms.[228][229][230] According to TVLine, the show was among the top ten scripted entertainment programs at the start of the 2024 fall season with delayed viewing included.[231][232] Fall 2024 ratings generally increased around 50 percent in Live+7 delayed Nielsen ratings.[233][234][235] The show had the eighth highest average viewership in delayed viewing without sports or news broadcasts, according to TV Guide.[236] According to CBS, the fall season 14 premiere was one of eight CBS shows to reach ten million viewers after seven days with multiplatform streaming and delayed viewing included, [237] and the show reached an average of 9.8 million viewers after 35 days including delayed and multi-platform viewing. [238] The series has performed well on streaming platform Paramount Plus, regularly among the top ten shows on the platform.[239][240] Analysts from entertainment analytics company Parrot Analytics have pointed to Blue Bloods as an example of long-running procedurals that still see strong audience demand.[241][242] In 2012, producer Brian Burns was a finalist for the Humanitas Prize for the Season 2 episode \"The Job.\"[282] In 2021, the show was awarded the TV Faith & Freedom Award for season 10, episode 19, \"Family Secrets\" at the MovieGuide Awards.[283] Writer producer Siobhan Byrne O'Connor was nominated for an Edgar Award in 2012[284] for the episode \"Innocence,\" in 2015 for the episode \"Unfinished Business\" [285] and in 2023 for the episode \"The Reagan Way.\"[286] Kevin Wade was nominated for an Edgar Award in 2019 for the episode \"My Aim is True.\"[284]",

The school competes in the Southeastern Conference in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The Tigers play their home games at Neville Arena in Auburn, Alabama on the university campus. The program began in 1906, and is currently coached by Bruce Pearl. Auburn has won five conference regular season championships and three SEC tournament championships. Auburn has appeared in the NCAA tournament 13 times, making it as far as the Final Four in 2019. 14 Auburn players have been named All-Americans and Auburn has had 100 All-SEC selections. Auburn has produced 35 NBA draft picks, including Jabari Smith (2022), who was selected with the third overall pick, the highest in Auburn history. Two Auburn players have been named SEC Player of the Year: Charles Barkley in 1984 and Chris Porter in 1999. Auburn has had six head coaches selected as SEC Coach of the Year a total of eight times, and former Auburn head coach Cliff Ellis was named National Coach of the Year by multiple outlets in 1999. Former Auburn player Charles Barkley was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006. Auburn has had 20 head men's basketball coaches since the program was started in 1906 by Mike Donahue. The program is currently coached by Bruce Pearl. Mike \"Iron Mike\" Donahue was Auburn's first head men's basketball coach, starting the program in 1906. He coached the program for 16 seasons, the longest tenure of any men's basketball coach in Auburn history, finishing with a record of 74–80–1 (.481). In addition to coaching basketball, Donahue served as athletic director and coached the football, baseball, track, and soccer teams while at Auburn.[3] Prior to his tenure as Auburn's head football coach, Ralph \"Shug\" Jordan coached the Auburn men's basketball program for 10 seasons. Jordan was a football assistant coach when he coached the men's basketball program. After playing football and basketball for Auburn from 1929 to 1932, Jordan became the head men's basketball coach in 1933. He coached until 1942, when he was called overseas to fight as an officer in World War II. Following his service, Jordan returned to Auburn to coach the 1945–46 team. He left Auburn to become the head men's basketball coach at Georgia after the season. Jordan finished with a record of 95–77 (.552) at Auburn. Joel Eaves was Auburn's 12th head men's basketball coach, coaching from 1949 to 1963. Eaves was a former Auburn football and basketball player, playing from 1934 to 1937 under head coach \"Shug\" Jordan. Auburn won its first ever SEC championship under Eaves in 1960, finishing 12–2 in the conference and 19–3 overall. Eaves was named SEC Coach of the Year following the 1960 season. Eaves finished with a 213–100 (.681) record at Auburn, making him the winningest men's basketball coach in Auburn history. Joel Eaves was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame in 1978.[4] Auburn's Memorial Coliseum was renamed after Eaves to Joel H. Eaves Memorial Coliseum in 1987, and later to Beard-Eaves-Memorial Coliseum in 1993.[5] Sonny Smith was the 15th head men's basketball coach at Auburn, coaching for 11 seasons from 1978 to 1989. Smith coached Auburn to the NCAA tournament in 5 consecutive seasons, 1984 to 1988, including a run to the Elite Eight in 1986 before losing to eventual national champion Louisville. In addition to leading Auburn to its first ever NCAA tournament in 1984, he also coached Auburn to its first SEC tournament championship in 1985. Smith is the only head men's basketball coach in Auburn history to coach three consecutive 20-win seasons, doing so from 1984 to 1986. Sonny Smith was named SEC Coach of the Year in 1984 and 1988. Smith coached his final season at Auburn in 1989, leaving to become the head men's basketball coach at VCU. Smith finished with a record of 173–154 (.529). Smith was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame in 2007.[6] Cliff Ellis was the 17th head men's basketball coach at Auburn. He coached for 10 seasons from 1994 to 2004. Ellis had some success early in his career, leading Auburn to the NIT three times in his first four seasons and being named SEC Coach of the Year in 1995. His most successful season at Auburn was the 1998–99 season, where he led the Tigers to an SEC regular season championship and the program's first ever #1 seed in the NCAA tournament, in which they reached the Sweet Sixteen. Ellis was named both SEC and National Coach of the Year in 1999.[7] Ellis would take Auburn to the NCAA tournament two more times: reaching the Second Round in 2000 and returning to the Sweet Sixteen in 2003. Ellis was released following the 2003–04 season after finishing the season with a 14–14 record. Auburn faced NCAA sanctions over alleged recruiting violations during the season, but Ellis was not found at fault after the investigation.[8] Ellis finished with a record of 186–125 (.598) at Auburn, trailing only Eaves on the school's all-time wins list. Bruce Pearl became Auburn's 20th head men's basketball coach on March 18, 2014.[9] He led Auburn to its third SEC regular season championship in the 2017–18 season and its second SEC tournament championship in 2019, en route to leading Auburn to its first ever Final Four in the 2019 NCAA tournament. Following another regular season championship in the 2021–22 season, Pearl was selected as SEC Coach of the Year.[10] Pearl's current record at Auburn is 200–119 (.627).

Auburn's first on-campus basketball facility was Alumni Gymnasium, which opened in February 1916.[13] Auburn played its home games in Alumni Gymnasium until Auburn Sports Arena was opened in 1946. Auburn Sports Arena was a 2,500 seat multi-purpose arena. Nicknamed \"The Barn,\" it opened in 1946. It was replaced when Beard-Eaves-Memorial Coliseum opened in 1969. Auburn Sports Arena stood until September 21, 1996, when it caught fire and burned down in the middle of a football game between Auburn and LSU.[14] Beard–Eaves–Memorial Coliseum is a 10,500-seat multipurpose arena that opened in 1969 under the name Memorial Coliseum. It was renamed after former player and coach Joel Eaves to Joel H. Eaves Memorial Coliseum in 1987. It was renamed for the final time to Beard-Eaves-Memorial Coliseum in 1993, adding the name of former Auburn athletic director Jeff Beard. Auburn boasted a 393–182 (.683) overall record at Beard–Eaves–Memorial Coliseum. Auburn had a winning record at home in 37 of the 42 seasons Auburn played in the Coliseum. Auburn's 30-game home winning streak from the 1997–98 season to the final game of the 1999–2000 season was the longest in Coliseum history. It was the nation's second longest current winning streak at the time and is the second longest home winning streak in Auburn history.[5] Auburn played its final season in Beard–Eaves–Memorial Coliseum in the 2009–10 season. Auburn's final game in Beard–Eaves–Memorial Coliseum was on March 3, 2010; Auburn beat Mississippi State 89–80.[15] On June 29, 2007, Auburn announced plans to build a new $92.5 million basketball arena and practice facilities that would eventually be completed for the 2010–11 season.[16] The arena was initially named Auburn Arena, but later renamed to Neville Arena in 2022. With a seating capacity of 9,121, Neville Arena is the smallest men's basketball arena in the SEC. Aside from the main court, the arena also contains two practice courts, a weight room, 12 suites, coaches offices, the Auburn Ticket Office, and the Lovelace Athletic Museum. Auburn played its first game in Auburn Arena on November 12, 2010, losing to UNC Asheville in overtime 70–69.[17] Auburn's first win in Auburn Arena came on November 21, 2010, when Auburn beat Middle Tennessee 68–66.[18] Auburn currently holds a 139–59 (.702) record in Neville Arena. Sometimes referred to as the \"Iron Bowl of Basketball,\" Auburn and Alabama have a fierce rivalry that dates back to 1924. Auburn and Alabama first met in the Southern Conference Tournament on March 1, 1924, and Auburn lost 19–40. The two programs did not meet again until 1941 in the SEC tournament, a matchup that Auburn lost again 16–38. The programs have played regularly since 1948, meeting at least twice every season starting in 1949. Auburn's first win in the rivalry came in their sixth meeting on December 20, 1949, when Auburn beat Alabama 45–40. Auburn and Alabama have met in the SEC Tournament 9 times, including Auburn's 53–49 overtime victory over Alabama in the 1985 SEC Tournament championship game. Alabama leads the all-time series 101–67. Georgia is Auburn's oldest rival, first meeting in 1908 in Columbus, GA. Auburn won that game 34–20. Auburn and Georgia have played at least once every year since 1945. Auburn leads the all-time series 99–96. Though Auburn and UAB have met just 21 times, the two programs have a strong history. The first game between the two schools was played on November 26, 1982, a matchup won by Auburn, 63–61. The programs met 16 more times over the next two decades until the series was discontinued after the 1999–2000 season. In 2015, Auburn and UAB agreed to a four-game series that reignited the rivalry.[19] Auburn leads the all-time series 11–10. Auburn's student section is known as The Jungle. Auburn held a vote to name their student section at the start of the 2011–12 season, and The Jungle was chosen from several options. Auburn officially started The Jungle on January 11, 2012, for the Auburn–Kentucky game.[20] The Jungle was awarded the Sixth Man Award at the 2012 team banquet for its \"outstanding support throughout the season and making Auburn Arena one of the loudest venues in the SEC.\"[21] The Auburn student section was previously known as Lebo's Lunatics during Jeff Lebo's tenure at Auburn and the Cliff Dwellers during Cliff Ellis' tenure.",

                "content": "Jackson State University (Jackson State or JSU) is a public historically black research university in Jackson, Mississippi. It is one of the largest HBCUs in the United States and the fourth largest university in Mississippi in terms of student enrollment. The university is a member of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund and classified among \"R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity\". Jackson State University's athletic teams, the Tigers, participate in NCAA Division I athletics as a member of the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC). Jackson State is also the home of the Sonic Boom of the South, a marching band founded in the 1940s. Their accompanying danceline, the Prancing J-Settes, are well known for their unique style of dance, known as J-Setting. Jackson State University developed from Natchez Seminary, founded October 23, 1877, in Natchez, Mississippi. The seminary was affiliated with the American Baptist Home Mission Society of New York, who established it \"for the moral, religious, and intellectual improvement of Christian leaders of the colored people of Mississippi and the neighboring states\".[11][12] In 1883, the school changed its name to Jackson College and moved from Natchez to a site in Jackson, the capital.[13] The college moved to its current location early in the 20th century, where it developed into a full state university.[13] Its original site in Jackson is now the location of Millsaps College. In 1934, during the Great Depression, the Baptist Society withdrew financial support. The school became a state-supported public institution in 1940 as the Mississippi Negro Training School. The name has changed over time: Jackson College for Negro Teachers in 1944;. Jackson State College in 1967, after desegregation; and with the addition of graduate programs and expanded curriculum, Jackson State University in 1974.[14] Many students at Jackson State College became active in the civil rights movement. Work to gain integrated practice and social justice continued after civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s. During an on-campus protest on May 14, 1970, two students were killed by police gunfire,[15] and an additional 12 students injured by gunfire.[16] A dormitory still bears the bullet marks fired on that day. The university drew national attention in 2023 when the faculty senate voted \"no confidence\" in university president Thomas Hudson. They alleged that he \"repeatedly failed to respect shared governance, transparency, and accountability\".[17] Shortly thereafter, the university's board of trustees placed Hudson on administrative leave and appointed Elayne Hayes-Anthony the acting president.[18] The main campus contains over 50 academic and administrative buildings on 245 acres (0.99 km2). It is located at 1400 John R. Lynch Street between Prentiss and Dalton Streets. Ayer Hall was constructed in 1903 and is the oldest structure on the main campus. It was named in honor of the first president of the institution, Charles Ayer. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Gibbs-Green Pedestrian Walkway was named in honor of the two young men who died in the Jackson State shooting in 1970. As a result of the landmark \"Ayers Settlement\" in 2002, the university, along with the other two public HBCUs in the state, has completed extensive renovations and upgrades to campus.[19] Jackson State has satellite campuses throughout the Jackson Metropolitan area: The board of trustees is the constitutional governing body of the Mississippi State Institutions of Higher Learning.[20] This body appoints the president of the university. There are 575 faculty and 1,431 staff; 54% of the faculty are tenured, teaching approximately 7,000 undergraduate and graduate students.[21] JSU colleges and schools include: In 2015, JSU became the first university in Mississippi approved by the legislature to establish a School of Public Health which is housed under the College of Health Sciences.[29][30] JSU is the only university in Mississippi to earn two consecutive \"Apple Distinguished School\" distinctions from Apple Inc.[31] Since 2012, Jackson State University has provided all first-time, full-time freshmen brand new iPads.[32] JSU is the first and only HBCU in Mississippi to support a bachelor's and master's level engineering program.[33] The W.E.B. Du Bois – Maria Luisa Alvarez Harvey Honors College is a selective interdisciplinary college at the university for the most high-achieving undergraduate students.[34] Tiger Battalion, the university's Army ROTC program is the host US Army ROTC program for Belhaven University, Delta State University, Hinds Community College, Millsaps College, Mississippi College, Mississippi College School of Law, Mississippi Valley State University, Tougaloo College, and University of Mississippi Medical Center's School of Nursing. Air Force Detachment 006 is the Air Force ROTC Component for the Jackson metropolitan area. Hosted at Jackson State, it also serves students from Belhaven University, Millsaps College, Mississippi College and Tougaloo College. Jackson State is a member of the Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) and the Southwestern Athletic Conference. JSU fields teams in basketball, track and field, cross country, baseball, softball, golf, tennis, soccer, bowling, volleyball, and football. The university's mascot is the Tiger, and the teams are sometimes referred to as the \"Blue Bengals\". JSU athletics is historically most well-known for its football program. JSU consistently leads the nation in Division I FCS football average home attendance.[35][36] JSU Tigers football alumni includes Pro Football Hall of Famers Lem Barney, Jackie Slater, Walter Payton, Robert Brazile, and Jimmy Smith. JSU participates in a number of notable football games with rival colleges. These include: As of 2024, JSU men's basketball has won five SWAC titles and made three NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament appearances. The marching band began in the 1940s at what was then Jackson State College, under the directorship of Frederick D. Hall, who had directed a band at the college as early as the 1920s, in addition to the chorus and orchestra. It was initially made up of students from Jackson College and Lanier High School.[40] Founded as the Jackson State University Marching Band, the name \"Sonic Boom of the South\" was adopted by the school in 1971, after having been suggested by band members.[40] The first full-time band director, William W. Davis, was appointed in 1948, replacing Charles Saulsburg, who had been director since 1947.[40] Davis had previously played trumpet in Cab Calloway's band, and Calloway's musical style and showmanship influenced Davis's conceptualization of the marching band.[40] The band at this time had around 20 members, increasing to 88 in 1963.[41] Davis retired as director in 1971, but remained the chief arranger for the band.[40] He was replaced by Harold J. Haughton.[40] Haughton was instrumental in the creation of the Prancing J-Settes, the band's accompanying danceline. In fall 2022, Jackson State's total enrollment was 6,906, of which 4,927 were undergraduate students and 1,979 were graduate.[42] As of fall 2020, 67% of Jackson State's student community were Mississippi residents, with the majority from Hinds County and Madison County. The top three feeder states were Illinois (409 students), Louisiana (269), and Georgia (220). Nigeria accounted for the highest number of international students on campus. 91% of students identified as Black, 6% identified as white, and 4% identified with various race categories. 31% of students were male, and 69% of students were female.[43] Jackson State University offers over 60 registered student organizations.

                "content": "The Army–Navy Game is an American college football rivalry game between the Army Black Knights of the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, New York, and the Navy Midshipmen of the United States Naval Academy (USNA) at Annapolis, Maryland. The Black Knights, or Cadets, and Midshipmen each represent their service's oldest officer commissioning sources. As such, the game has come to embody the spirit of the interservice rivalry of the United States Armed Forces. The game marks the end of the college football regular season and the third and final game of the season's Commander-in-Chief's Trophy series, which also includes the Air Force Falcons of the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) near Colorado Springs, Colorado. The Army–Navy Game is one of the most traditional and enduring rivalries in college football. It has been frequently attended by the President of the United States.[1] The game has been nationally televised each year since 1945 on either ABC, CBS, or NBC. CBS has televised the game since 1996 and has the rights to the broadcast through 2038. The December 2024 announcement of CBS Sports' extension will also give their international channels rights in the United Kingdom and Australia.[2] Instant replay made its American debut in the 1963 Army–Navy game.[3] Since 2009, the game has been held on the second Saturday of December and following FBS conference championship weekend.[4] The game has been primarily played in Philadelphia, but the game has also been held in multiple locations including the New York area, the Baltimore–Washington area, Chicago, Pasadena, California and the Boston area. The series has been uninterrupted since 1930. Through the 2024 meeting, Navy leads the series 63–55–7. The first game between Army and Navy was on November 29, 1890. Since then, the two academies have played annually in all but ten years, and have played in consecutive annual games every season since 1930. Throughout its history, the game has been played in several neutral locations, including New York City and Baltimore, but it is most commonly played in Philadelphia, which is roughly equidistant from the two academies. Historically played on the Saturday after Thanksgiving (a date on which most other major college football teams end their regular seasons), the game is now played on the second Saturday in December and is traditionally the last regular-season game played in NCAA Division I football. For much of the first two thirds of the 20th century, both Army and Navy were often national powers, and the game occasionally had national championship implications. However, as the level of play in college football increased, both academies' stringent admissions standards and height and weight limits made it difficult for them to compete. Since 1963, only the 1996, 2010, 2016, 2017, and 2024 games have seen both teams enter with winning records. Nonetheless, the game is considered a college football institution. The tradition associated with the game has kept it airing nationally on radio since 1930 and on television since 1945. It has remained an over-the-air broadcast even in the age of cable, satellite, and streaming. The game is especially emotional for the seniors, called \"first classmen\" by both academies, since it is typically the last competitive regular season football game they will ever play (though they sometimes play in a subsequent bowl game). However, some participants in the Army–Navy Game have gone on to professional football careers. For example, quarterback Roger Staubach (Navy, 1965) went on to a Hall of Fame career with the National Football League's Dallas Cowboys that included starting at quarterback in two Super Bowl victories (including being named the Most Valuable Player of Super Bowl VI), and Alejandro Villanueva (Army, 2010) was later an offensive tackle with the NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Ravens.[5] The game is the last of three contests in the annual Commander-in-Chief's Trophy series, awarded to each season's winner of the triangular series among Army, Navy, and Air Force since 1972. The rivalries Army and Navy have with Air Force are much less intense than the Army–Navy rivalry, primarily due to the relative youth of the USAFA, established in 1954, and the physical distance between the USAFA and the other two schools. The Army–Air Force and Navy–Air Force games are usually played at the academies' regular home fields, although on occasion they have been held at a neutral field. Since 1901, there have been ten sitting presidents of the United States to attend the Army–Navy Game. The first was Theodore Roosevelt, who attended the game in 1901 and 1905. Harry S. Truman attended all but one edition during his eight years in office (1945–1952), missing the 1951 game due to vacation. George W. Bush and Donald Trump each attended three times; Bush in 2001, 2004, and 2008, and Trump in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Trump also attended two games as president-elect in 2016 and 2024.[6][7] John F. Kennedy attended both games played during his presidency in 1961 and 1962; he was assassinated fifteen days before the 1963 game. Presidents who each attended once include Woodrow Wilson (1913), Calvin Coolidge (1924), Gerald Ford (1974), Bill Clinton (1996), and Barack Obama (2011).[8][7] On October 25, 2023, it was announced that Army would join Navy in the American Athletic Conference (AAC) in football effective in the 2024 season. As part of the arrangement, the Army–Navy Game will remain an out-of-conference date for both schools, and still be played on an annual basis. In the event that the teams possess the two highest win-loss records within the AAC, it is conceivable that they would contend in an AAC Championship game, potentially leading to the occurrence of consecutive Army–Navy Games.[9] The rivalry between Annapolis and West Point, while friendly, is intense. The phrases \"Beat Navy!\" and \"Beat Army!\" are ingrained in the respective institutions and have become a symbol of competitiveness, not just in the Army–Navy Game, but in the service of the country. The phrases are often used at the close of (informal) letters by graduates of both academies. A long-standing tradition at the Army–Navy football game is to conduct a formal \"prisoner exchange\" as part of the pre-game activities. The prisoners are the cadets and midshipmen currently spending the semester studying at the sister academy. After the exchange, students have a brief reprieve to enjoy the game with their comrades.[10] During the pre-game ceremony, the invocation is followed by the American national anthem sung by members of the USMA and USNA choirs.[11] At the end of the game, both teams' almae matres are performed. The winning team stands alongside the losing team and faces the losing academy's students; then the losing team accompanies the winning team, facing their students.[12] This is done in a show of mutual respect and solidarity. Since the winning team's alma mater is always played last, the phrase \"sing second\" has become synonymous with winning the rivalry game. Navy Midshipman (and later Admiral) Joseph Mason Reeves wore what is widely regarded as the first football helmet in the 1893 Army–Navy Game. He had been advised by a Navy doctor that another kick to his head would result in intellectual disability or even death, so he commissioned an Annapolis shoemaker to make him a helmet out of leather.[13] On November 27, 1926, the Army–Navy Game was held in Chicago for the National Dedication of Soldier Field as a monument to American servicemen who had fought in World War I. Navy came to the game undefeated, while Army had only lost to Notre Dame. Played before a crowd of over 100,000, the teams fought to a 21–21 tie, resulting in Navy being awarded a share of the national championship.[14][15] In both the 1944 and 1945 contests, Army and Navy entered the game ranked #1 and #2 respectively.[16] The 1945 game was labeled the \"game of the century\" before it was played. Army (9–0) defeated Navy (7-0-1) with a score of 32–13. Navy's tie was against Notre Dame.[17] In 1963, shortly after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Jacqueline Kennedy urged the academies to play after there had been talk of cancellation. Originally scheduled for November 30, 1963, the game was played on December 7, 1963, also coinciding with the 22nd anniversary of Pearl Harbor Day.[18] In front of a crowd of 102,000 people in Philadelphia's Municipal Stadium, later renamed John F. Kennedy Stadium, junior (second class midshipman) quarterback Roger Staubach led number two ranked Navy to victory which clinched a Cotton Bowl national championship matchup with Texas. Army was led by junior (second class cadet) quarterback Rollie Stichweh. Stichweh led off the game with a touchdown drive that featured the first use of instant replay.[19] Army nearly won the game after another touchdown and two point conversion, Stichweh recovered the onside kick and drove the ball to the Navy 2 yard line. On 4th down and no timeouts, crowd noise prevented Stichweh from calling a play and time expired with the 21–15 final score. Staubach won the Heisman Trophy that year and was bumped off the scheduled cover of Life magazine due to the coverage of the assassination. Stichweh and Staubach would meet again in 1964 as seniors where Stichweh's Army would defeat Staubach's Navy. In that game, Calvin Huey of Navy became the first African-American to play in the series.[20] Staubach went on to serve in the Navy and afterward became a Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback with the Dallas Cowboys. Stichweh served five years in Vietnam with the 173rd Airborne Brigade. Stichweh was inducted into the Army Sports Hall of Fame in 2012.[21][22] On December 10, 2016, Army defeated Navy for the first time since 2001 with a 21–17 victory, snapping its 14-game losing streak against Navy. In 2022, Army defeated Navy by a score of 20–17 in double overtime in the first overtime game in the series' history. Only seven games have ever been held on the campus of either academy, primarily because neither team has ever played at an on-campus stadium large enough to accommodate the large crowds that attend. The rivalry's first four games were hosted on the parade grounds of the respective academies. For all but three years since 1899, it has been held at a neutral site. Two were held on campus due to World War II travel restrictions (1942 at Navy's old Thompson Stadium and 1943 at Michie Stadium); and the 2020 game was held at Michie Stadium due to COVID-19 restrictions in Philadelphia. Philadelphia has been the traditional home of the Army–Navy game, due to the historic nature of the city and its location approximately halfway between West Point and Annapolis. Through the 2023 meeting, 90 of the 124 games in the series have been contested in Philadelphia, including every game from 1932 to 1982 except three games that were relocated due to World War II travel restrictions. For decades, the Pennsylvania Railroad and its successors offered game-day service to all Army–Navy games in Philadelphia using a sprawling temporary station constructed each year near Municipal Stadium on the railroad's Greenwich freight yard. The service, with more than 40 trains serving as many as 30,000 attendees, was the single largest concentrated passenger rail movement in the country.[23][24] All games contested in Philadelphia through 1935 were played at what is now Franklin Field, the home field of the University of Pennsylvania. From 1936 through 1979, all games contested in Philadelphia were held at Municipal Stadium, renamed John F. Kennedy Stadium in 1964. From 1980 to 2001, all games contested in Philadelphia took place at Veterans Stadium. Since 2003, all games contested in Philadelphia have been played at Lincoln Financial Field. Outside of Philadelphia, the New York area has been the most frequent Army–Navy site. The Polo Grounds holds the record for most games hosted outside of Philadelphia with nine. It was the location of all New York City games through 1927. Yankee Stadium was the site of the game in 1930 and 1931. Six games have been hosted in New Jersey: 1905 at Osborne Field at Princeton University, four games at Giants Stadium from 1989 to 2002, and 2021 at MetLife Stadium. A number of games throughout the history of the series have also been hosted in Maryland. In Baltimore, Municipal Stadium was the location of the 1924 and 1944 games. Four games were played at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore since 2000. In 2011, the game was played at FedExField in Landover, Maryland. The 2023 game was held at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts. The Rose Bowl is the only site west of the Mississippi River where an Army–Navy game has been played, in 1983. Pasadena, California, home to the Rose Bowl, paid for the travel expenses of all the students and supporters of both academies, including 9,437 in all. The game was held at the Rose Bowl that year because there are a large number of military installations and servicemen and women, along with many retired military personnel, on the West Coast.[25] The game has been held one other time in a non-East Coast venue, at Chicago's Soldier Field, which hosted the 1926 game.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Navy defeated Army 31-13 on Saturday to take home the Commander-In-Chief's Trophy, and it was a much-deserved win. The Midshipmen opened the game with a 65-yard touchdown drive and never gave up the lead from there. The Navy offense provided plenty of big plays to put points on the board, while the defense stifled Army all afternoon. The star of the game was Navy quarterback Blake Horvath, who excelled on the ground and in the air as he finished with 204 yards rushing and a two touchdowns rushing while also throwing for 107 yards and two touchdowns. The big play was a 52-yard touchdown pass to Eli Heidenreich in the third quarter that extended Navy's lead to 21-10 after Army opened the second half with a field goal. Army just could not match the output. Quarterback Bryson Daily had an outstanding season and earned enough votes to finish sixth in Heisman Trophy balloting, but he had no room to run on Saturday against the stifling Midshipmen defensive attack. Daily was held to only 52 yards rushing, though he did throw for a score. It's only the second time this season Daily failed to score a rushing touchdown. It's also the first time since 2010 that this game included three or more passing touchdowns. The win gives Navy its 17th Commander-In-Chief's Trophy, which trails Air Force's 21 for most all-time. CBS Sports will update this story shortly with takeaways. This was only Newberry's second Army-Navy Game in charge of the Naval Academy, but it was important for him to get his first win. Not for himself, but for the Academy as a whole. Navy dominated this series for nearly 20 years, winning 16 of 18 meetings between 1997 and 2015, but the tide has turned in recent seasons. Army had not only won six of the last eight meetings entering the season, but it showed up in Navy's conference this year and won it on the first try. Navy hasn't won the league in any of its 10 seasons. But you know what? None of that matters. Navy won this game, and the Commander-In-Chief's Trophy is heading to Annapolis. In the end, that's all that matters to either of these teams. Any time there's a game between service academies, turnovers will have a tremendous impact. They're important in every game. But in ones like this, when there are fewer possessions, they take on greater significance. What's truly wild is there were five fumbles in the game but all were recovered by the fumbling team. What's wilder than that is Army came into the game with the lowest overall turnover rate on offense this season and the fewest total turnovers with five. And then it turned the ball over three times in this game. Bryson Daily doesn't drop back to pass often, but when he does, he takes care of the football. He'd thrown only one interception all season, but Navy made him uncomfortable all game and forced him into throwing three today. There was simply no way Army could overcome the mistakes. While Blake Horvath will (deservedly) receive plenty of accolades, we shouldn't overlook the job the Navy defense did in this game. It was clear what Navy's gameplan was: take away the Army rushing attack and force Bryson Daily to become a dropback passer to find explosive plays. It's been the same approach every team that's faced Army this season took but few succeeded. Navy dominated. Army was held to 113 yards rushing, averaging only 2.9 yards per carry. Not even the Notre Dame defense was as effective, as Army managed 207 yards on 3.6 yards per carry in that game. The longest rush Army managed all game was a 12-yard pickup by Kanye Udoh (53 yards on 14 carries). Daily didn't have a rush greater than 5 yards in the entire game. Blake Horvath was having a solid season for Navy, but I'm not sure anybody saw this performance coming. He had been knocked out of Navy's loss to Tulane with an injury to his throwing shoulder that kept him out of Navy's last game against East Carolina. It was reasonable to question whether Horvath would be available to play this game, or if he'd even be 100% if he did play. Well, if this wasn't Horvath at 100%, I fear what he's capable of at full strength. Horvath threw for 107 yards and two touchdowns in the game, which feels out of line for a service academy but is in line with what he's done all year. It's eighth time he's thrown for at least 100 yards in a game this year and the fifth time he's thrown multiple touchdowns. However, his rushing total of 204 yards was the most he's had in a game since rushing for 211 against Memphis back on Sept. 21, and that was in a 56-44 shootout that saw few tackles made. He hadn't rushed for more than 129 yards in any other game this season. What was truly remarkable is that Horvath had a game on the ground everybody expected from Army's Bryson Daily, who entered the game tied with Boise State's Ashton Jeanty for most rushing touchdowns this season with 29. Army will need a miracle now. Navy takes advantage of the interception by getting a 27-yard field goal to extend its lead to 18 points. More important than the three points, however, was the three minutes of game clock the Midshipmen offense took off the clock doing so. Army is out of timeouts and has only 3:45 left to get three scores. I'm going to say the odds aren't great. Horvath just tacked another 48 yards onto his rushing total and Navy is inside the Army 15. Horvath is up to 199 yards rushing on 24 carries. Army has 178 yards total. Bryson Daily rolls to his left to buy time, crosses the line of scrimmage, and unleashes a pass back across the field. It's picked off, but then comes loose but before hitting the ground it finds the welcome arms of another Navy defender. It's a turnover, and Navy gets the ball back at midfield with 7:24 left to play ahead by 15 points. It's been that kind of day for both teams. That should just about do it. Army needed a stop, but Navy didn't oblige. It's a 10-play, 75-yard touchdown drive kept alive by a brilliant fake punt and finished by a 1-yard touchdown run from Blake Horvath. Horvath is now up to 144 yards on the ground and two touchdowns. Army only has 167 yards as a team. With only 8:50 remaining, and Army down to one timeout, it'll be extremely difficult for the Knights to mount a comeback. Navy with the trickery! Facing a fourth down at midfield, the Midshipmen run a fake by getting the ball to defensive lineman Landon Robinson, who picks up 30 yards. Of course, it was also nearly a disaster as Robinson, who isn't used to carrying the ball, fumbled when tackled but Navy was able to get back on the ball. That fake may have just iced the game. The good news for Army is it got a 31-yard field goal to make it a one-score game. The bad news is it needed 13 plays to move 45 yards and burned 6:43 of game time in the process. There's still 14:44 left to go in the game, but further complicating matters is Army used two timeouts on the possession, leaving them with only one. Now Army needs to get a stop and a touchdown and two-point conversion to force overtime. Another Navy score would likely ice the game, unless it comes very quickly. Casey Reynolds runs a double-move and finds himself WIDE OPEN in the end zone, but Bryson Daily's throw sails over his head and out of reach. Huge miss. Navy leads Army 21-10 after three quarters, and the Midshipmen have been able to expand their lead in the second half. After leading 14-7 at halftime, Army opened the second half with a field goal drive, but Navy wasted little time responding as Blake Horvath hit Eli Heidenreich for a 52-yard touchdown less than 2 minutes later. Not all hope is lost for Army, though. The Knights ended the third quarter with their offense in the red zone looking to cut this down to a one-score game. To do so, Army will have to solve a Navy run defense that's proven tough through 45 minutes. Army has rushed for 111 yards as a team but is averaging only 3 yards per carry. Compare that to Navy QB Blake Horvath, who has rushed for 101 yards by himself. Their run game continuing to falter, Army is forced to make a decision on fourth-and-6 at its 45-yard line. Jeff Monken leaves the offense out, but the Knights take too much time to get lined up, and Bryson Daily is forced to burn a timeout. Now Army not only faces a critical fourth down while down two scores late in the third quarter, but it's down a timeout that could prove crucial later in the game. Just a mess all around. The good news for Army is Navy is called for roughing the passer on fourth down to extend the drive. There was also a flag for pass interference, but Army declined the penalty. Navy is suddenly a quick-strike offense. Blake Horvath drops back, finds Eli Heidenreich with a pass along the sideline, and all he has to do is shake a tackler and it's 52 yards down the sideline for the score. It's Horvath's second touchdown pass of of the game and he's now up to 107 yards through the air and 101 on the ground. Horvath and Army's Bryson Daily have combined for three passing touchdowns already today, which is the most in any Army-Navy Game since 2010. As for Heidenreich, it's been obvious that Army's defensive intention was to take him out of the game, and up until that touchdown, it had been successful. Army went 47 yards in 11 plays and kept its drive alive by drawing a pass interference on a surprise pass on fourth down, but Navy's run defense continues to play well and was able tos tall the drive. After an incomplete pass from Bryson Daily, Trey Gronotte hit a 39-yard field goal to cut the lead to 14-10. The drive started with a 12-yard gain by Kanye Udoh, but outside of that run, Army was stifled. Daily has attempted 10 passes, which is not the recipe for success with this Army offense. He has not been able to get anything going on the ground, as he's been held to 2.4 yards per carry, and hasn't had a run longer than 5 yards. Army begins the half with the ball at the Army 30. We've got an excellent one on our hands in the 125th edition of the Army-Navy Game. It looked as if we could be in for a one-sided contest early after Navy scored a touchdown on its opening possession and would tack on a second to go ahead 14-0 as Army struggled to do anything on offense. Army finally broke through in the second quarter to cut the lead in half, however, but the Black Knights have struggled to find consistency on offense otherwise. They managed only 56 yards rushing, averaging a scant 2.9 yards per carry. Both quarterbacks in the game are playing well. Navy's Blake Horvath has thrown for 55 yards and rushed for another 98 with a touchdown through the air and on the ground. Army's Bryson Daily, who has been dealing with a cut on his non-throwing hand since having it stepped on early in the game, threw a touchdown as well. He's at 50 yards passing, but he has been held to 30 on the ground. Army will get the ball to start the second half and try to tie this game up. The Navy defense is having an outstanding day. Aside from the touchdown drive, Army hasn't been able to do much of anything, and it's because Navy is holding them to 2.9 yards per carry on the ground. Navy gets the ball at its 35 with 1:25 to play and two timeouts. We'll see how aggressive they want to get here. Staying ahead of the chains is so critical in this matchup. Blake Horvath shakes a defender and takes off for 37 yards to get into Army territory, but on the very next play the Midshipmen lose yards, and two plays later they're forced to punt because of it. Army gets the ball with a chance to tie before halftime at its 8-yard line with just over 4 minutes to work with. Army is finally on the board, and it didn't get there on the ground. Bryson Daily hits Hayden Reed on a jump pass for a 23-yard touchdown to cap off an 8-play, 65-yard drive. It was a sorely needed drive for Army too. After managing only 25 yards and two first downs on their first two possessions, the Knights picked up three first downs on their third possession, and converted on a crucial fourth down to keep the drive alive. Turnovers are crucial in this game, and Navy took advantage of the first one in the game. The Midshipmen march 44 yards in 3 plays following the interception with Blake Horvath hitting Brandon Chatman for an 18-yard touchdown pass on a wheel route out of the backfield. The big play of the drive was a 21-yard run by Horvath, who originally dropped back to pass, saw nobody option and took off. Horvath is having a great day so far, as he's thrown for 49 yards and a touchdown while also rushing for 48 yards and a touchdown. He has 97 yards by himself while Army only has 25 as a team. Army came into the day with only five turnovers on the season. The lowest number in the country. They just had their sixth. Bryson Daily dropped back on third down, held the ball far too long, and then made a bad throw that was picked off by Navy's Dashaun Peele. It's Peele's fifth interception of the season, and only the second thrown by Daily. The Midshipmen get the ball with great field position again at the Army 44. We're through one quarter of The Army-Navy Game, and it looks a lot like what you'd expect from a game between two option offenses -- there have been a lot of runs and very few plays because the clock never stops. That said, Navy may only be up a touchdown, but it's been the far more successful of the two. Navy went 65 yards on the opening possession of the game, picking up 31 yards on a screen pass and converting on three third downs to keep the drive alive. Blake Horvath cashed in at the end with a 1-yard touchdown run that serves as all the scoring we've seen so far. Army hasn't had nearly as much success. The Black Knights' first possession picked up only 13 yards before resulting in a punt. Making matters worse, QB Bryson Daily had his hand stepped on. His left hand is bandaged as Army has the ball to start the second quarter and faces a decision on fourth-and-short. When you have two offenses that pitch the ball and run a lot, fumbles can often determine outcomes. Navy avoided losing the ball here, but losing 14 yards on a bad pitch is not a recipe for long-term success. While Horvath was able to get on the loose ball before Army, this play derails Navy's latest possession and leads to a punt. Army's second possession will begin at its 12-yard line. Army's first possession of the day didn't accomplish much. The Knights managed only 1 first down and 13 yards before having to punt. The most interesting part of the possession is that Army QB Bryson Daily is already bleeding. There's a cut on his non-throwing hand that doesn't look too serious, but makes for a cool visual. That's an impressive way to start the game. After getting excellent field position following a kickoff out of bounds, Navy goes 65 yards in 12 plays that included three conversions on third down. The biggest play was a 31-yard screen pass to Alex Tecza that got the Mids into the red zone, and it was capped off by a 1-yard QB sneak from Blake Horvath. And, in traditional service academy manner, the drive took over 6 minutes off the clock. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
