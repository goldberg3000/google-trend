                "content": "Marcus Freeman (born January 10, 1986) is an American football coach and former linebacker who is the head coach of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. He previously served as the defensive coordinator and linebackers coach at Notre Dame in 2021. Freeman has also previously served as an assistant coach at the University of Cincinnati, Purdue University, Kent State University, and Ohio State University. Freeman played college football at Ohio State and was drafted by the Chicago Bears in the fifth round of the 2009 NFL draft. He was a member of the Chicago Bears, Buffalo Bills and Houston Texans, but never appeared in a regular-season NFL game. Marcus Freeman was born at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base Medical Center in Fairborn, Ohio.[1][2] Freeman's mother, Chong Freeman, is from South Korea,[3] and met his father, Michael Freeman, an African American, while he was serving in the U.S. Air Force and then moved to Ohio in 1976.[4][5] He has an older brother, Michael Jr.[6] Freeman attended Wayne High School in Huber Heights, Ohio.[6] He totaled 152 tackles, including 29 behind the line of scrimmage, and eight sacks as a junior. As a senior, he was rated as one of the top three overall prospects in Ohio and was named to the Parade All-American Team after being credited with 127 tackles, four sacks, three forced fumbles, and three fumble recoveries as a senior. Freeman was a four-year starter and a two-time first-team All-Ohio selection. He was also part of the track and field team, competing in the 4 × 100 metres relay and throwing the shot and discus. As a freshman, Freeman was part of the team that won the OHSAA track and field championship. Freeman finished his freshman season in 2004 with four tackles (one solo) while playing in 13 games. Freeman was redshirted in 2005 after injuring his knee in the Buckeyes' first game against Miami (OH).[7] During the 2006 season, Freeman made 71 tackles while playing in 13 games, 11 of which he started, and was second on the team with six pass break-ups and two interceptions. In 2007, Freeman was a second-year starting linebacker and a part of three special units. He was later named second-team All-Big Ten after he totaled 109 tackles, 9.5 tackles for loss, and five pass deflections. In 2008, Freeman started all 13 games for the Buckeyes, tallying 84 tackles (39 solo), 9.5 tackles for loss, four pass breakups, a fumble recovery, and 3.5 sacks. For his efforts, he was named to the All-Big Ten second team for a second straight year and was an Academic All-Big Ten selection. Following the season, Freeman declared for the 2009 NFL draft. Freeman appeared in 51 games (37 starts) throughout his career. He started 26 games at weak-side linebacker and 11 games at strong-side linebacker and was a two-time Second-team All-Big Ten selection. He finished his career 19th on the school's all-time tackle list with 268 stops (140 solo) and was credited with 21.5 TFLs, 6.0 sacks, 15 PBUs, 2 forced fumbles and 1 fumble recovery. Freeman was drafted in the fifth round of the 2009 NFL draft by the Chicago Bears.[9] On September 4, he was waived. On September 22, 2009, Freeman signed onto the Buffalo Bills practice squad.[10] The team later released him on October 5. On November 4, 2009, Freeman signed with the Houston Texans. On May 1, 2010, Freeman retired due to an enlarged heart condition. Freeman served as a graduate assistant at Ohio State in 2010.[11] In January 2011, Freeman was hired as the linebackers coach for Kent State, a position he would hold until 2012.[12] On January 18, 2013, Freeman was hired as the linebackers coach for the Purdue Boilermakers.[13] In 2016, Freeman was promoted to co-defensive coordinator.[14] Freeman helped transform the linebackers group into a strength for the Boilermakers, coaching future NFL players Danny Ezechukwu and Ja'Whaun Bentley. On December 13, 2016, Freeman joined the Cincinnati Bearcats football staff as defensive coordinator and linebackers coach.[15] After being one of the first hires by Luke Fickell, Freeman transformed the Bearcats into one of the best defenses of the American Athletic Conference (AAC). In 2018, Freeman's defense led the AAC in rushing defense, scoring defense and total defense and ranked among the Top-15 in the NCAA FBS in all three categories. The next season, the Bearcats finished atop the 2019 AAC ranks in scoring defense for the second-straight season and ranked among the league's top three in rushing and total defense.[16] Prior to the end of the 2020 season, Freeman had declined a handful of positions to remain at Cincinnati including offers of returning to Ohio State as linebackers coach,[17] linebackers coach for the Tennessee Titans,[18] and defensive coordinator at Michigan State,[19] among other offers. Freeman had been considered by a number of national outlets as one of the rising stars of the college coaching ranks.[20] Freeman was a finalist for the Broyles Award and named the 247Sports Defensive Coordinator of the Year during the 2020 season.[21][22] On January 8, 2021, Freeman was hired as defensive coordinator and linebackers coach for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. Freeman was the top choice for the position of head coach Brian Kelly.[23] Prior to this hiring, it was rumored that Freeman would join LSU in the same role.[24] Following the 2021 regular season, Brian Kelly left Notre Dame to become the head coach for LSU.[25] On December 3, 2021, Freeman was selected to replace him, becoming the 32nd head coach in program history.[26] Freeman took control immediately, coaching the Irish in their Fiesta Bowl loss to No. 9 Oklahoma State.[27] Freeman opened the 2022 season with losses to No. 2 Ohio State and Marshall, thus becoming first head coach in Notre Dame history to start his career with three losses.[28] He gained his first win the following week against the California Golden Bears. Freeman's Irish would go on to finish the regular season ranked 19th with a record of 8-4, including a win over No. 5 Clemson. They were awarded a berth in the Gator Bowl, where they defeated South Carolina 45–38. Analysts anticipated the 2023 season would be a step forward for Freeman’s Fighting Irish. During the offseason, they secured the top-ranked quarterback in the transfer portal, Wake Forest’s Sam Hartman, and they entered the season ranked 13th. After beginning the season 4–0 with comfortable wins over Navy, Tennessee State, North Carolina State, and Central Michigan, the Irish rose to 9th in the rankings. They fell at home the next week to Ohio State, 17–14, in a heartbreaking loss that saw Notre Dame with only 10 players on the field, instead of the usual 11, twice on Ohio State’s game winning drive. They rebounded the next week with a thrilling win over No. 17 Duke, but then lost the following game to No. 25 Louisville. One week later, Irish enjoyed a season-defining 48-20 victory over No. 10 USC and Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Caleb Williams. Following a bye week, Freeman’s Irish defeated Pittsburgh and fell to unranked Clemson before winning against Wake Forest and Stanford to finish the regular season 9–3. They faced No. 19 Oregon State in the Sun Bowl, winning 40–8 to conclude the season 10–3 and ranked 14th. The 2023 campaign was defined by strong performances from star running back Audric Estime, quarterback Sam Hartman, tight end Mitchell Evans, and safety Xavier Watts, but it was also marred by poor play at the wide receiver position, especially following early injuries to veteran receivers Jayden Thomas and Deion Colzie. Evans’ injury against Pittsburgh left the Irish without any reliable pass catchers, and the team struggled when unable to run the ball at will. Following the season, Freeman fired wide receivers coach Chansi Stuckey, prompting the departure of starting wide receivers Chris Tyree, Tobias Meriweather, and Rico Flores Jr. Freeman hired Mike Brown as the new receivers coach on December 10. He then got quarterback Riley Leonard in the transfer portal from Duke. Freeman’s 2024 squad started their campaign successfully on the road against No. 20 Texas A&M in College Station, Texas with a 23–13 win, but followed that victory up with a 16–14 loss to Northern Illinois as a 29.5-point betting favorite, becoming the first AP Top 5 team to ever suffer a loss to a football team from the Mid-American Conference (MAC). The Irish finished the regular season with a 10-game winning streak with wins over No. 15 Louisville, No. 24 Navy, No. 19 Army, and a 49–35 win against USC in the renewed rivalry game. The Irish were granted the 7th seed in the College Football Playoff, hosting their first-ever home playoff game at Notre Dame Stadium. Freeman would win his first playoff game with a 27–17 win over 10th-seeded Indiana. Originally Notre Dame was set to play the 2nd-seeded Georgia Bulldogs in the Sugar Bowl on January 1, 2025, but due to the 2025 New Orleans truck attack that happened near the Caesars Superdome the game was rescheduled to the following day. Notre Dame beat Georgia by a score of 23–10, marking the first time in program history that Notre Dame had a 13-win season. Notre Dame would then proceed to beat the 6th-seeded Penn State Nittany Lions in the Orange Bowl, advancing to the national title game for the first time in 12 years. They will play the winner of the Cotton Bowl Classic. With this win, Freeman also became the first African American, as well as the first Asian, head coach to reach a Division I national college football championship.[29] In 2010, Freeman married Joanna (née Herncane), whom he dated since college. The couple have six children.[30][31] In 2022, Freeman became a Catholic.[32] # denotes interim head coach",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Notre Dame, behind third-year head coach Marcus Freeman, is moving on to the College Football Playoff National Championship after securing a thrilling 27-24 win over Penn State in the 2025 Orange Bowl semifinal. This will be the first time that the Fighting Irish, who are the first team in the sport's history to win two bowl games in a single postseason, compete for a national championship since 2012. Freeman is making history of his own, too, as he will become the first Black coach to lead his team into a Division I college football national title game when the ball is kicked on Monday, Jan. 20 in Atlanta. Freeman, whose father is Black and mother is South Korean, is also the first coach of Asian descent to compete in the CFP. \"I've said this before: I don't ever want to take attention away from the team,\" Freeman said after the Orange Bowl. \"It is an honor, and I hope all coaches -- minorities, Black, Asian, white, it doesn't matter, great people -- continue to get opportunities to lead young men like this. But this ain't about me. This is about us. We're going to celebrate what we've done because it's so special.\" Freeman, who served as Notre Dame's defensive coordinator for one season before he was promoted to head coach in the wake of Brian Kelly's departure following the 2021 season, is now 34-9 in three full seasons as Notre Dame's coach. That record includes nine straight wins against AP-ranked opponents and a 3-0 showing in College Football Playoff games. Given Freeman's counterpart on Thursday night in Miami Gardens, Florida, was James Franklin of Penn State, it was guaranteed that a Black coach would advance to the CFP National Championship. Earlier this week, Franklin shared his desire that the showdown with Freeman would have a similar impact on young coaches as when he saw Tony Dungy and Lovie Smith go head-to-head in Super Bowl XLI -- the first NFL championship featuring Black head coaches. \"I remember thinking that, as a coach, how significant that was in the profession and how significant that was for young coaches coming up in the profession to see those guys in that role,\" Franklin said. \"I also remember, at that time, that there was a lot of conversations about, 'Will this impact the profession? Will this impact have earned opportunities for guys?'\" Ohio State and Texas are set to face one another in the 2025 Cotton Bowl on Friday night with the final spot in the College Football Playoff National Championship up for grabs. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

                "content": "Editions: En/ncaa Notre Dame will play for the National Championship for the first time since 2013 Notre Dame's 27-24 win over Penn State not only secured their first trip to the national championship game since 2013 (where they lost 42-14 to Alabama), but it was the Fighting Irish's most significant win since their 1988 national championship triumph, a 34-21 win over West Virginia. Under head coach Marcus Freeman, Notre Dame has been on a tear, not losing a game since September and winning 13 straight. The semifinal win was their closest game since September 28, when they defeated Louisville 31-24. From that point on, the Irish dominated every opponent by at least 10 points, cementing their reputation as a powerhouse and the surprise team of the season. Today is especially special for Freeman, as he is celebrating not only his team's historic accomplishment, but also his 39th birthday. Freeman, who started as Notre Dame's defensive coordinator, took over as head coach after Brian Kelly left for LSU. He made his head coaching debut at age 36 in the 2021 Fiesta Bowl, a game Notre Dame lost. The struggles continued with two more losses to start the 2022 season, making Freeman the first head coach in Notre Dame history to start his career 0-3. Since then, however, Freeman has turned things around spectacularly, amassing 33 wins and just six more losses. His resume now includes five consecutive bowl game victories, three of which came in this season's playoffs against Indiana, Georgia and Penn State. This latest victory is undoubtedly the highlight of Freeman's young career, surpassing last week's triumph over Georgia. Freeman also made history as the first black head coach to lead a team to a national championship. When asked by ESPN about the milestone, Freeman humbly deflected the attention back to his team, saying, \"I don't want to take any attention away from the team. It's an honor, and I hope all coaches, minorities, black, Asian, white, get the opportunity to lead young men like this.\" His passion, dedication and commitment to his players and the university are evident and is something a powerhouse like Notre Dame always needs, known for producing NFL talent, the Fighting Irish began the season with 52 active players in the league, ranking sixth among all schools. Related: The reality is that whoever emerges from the other semifinal between Ohio State and Texas will likely be favored to win the National Championship. However, Notre Dame head coach Marcus Freeman has shown that he isn't worried about being the underdog. Freeman has proven his ability to adjust and set his team up for victory, as evidenced by the semifinal win over Penn State. Despite being thoroughly outplayed in the first half, his halftime adjustments turned the game around, as they came back from a 10-3 halftime deficit and a 24-17 deficit in the 4th quarter to secure the win. A key moment came in the final 30 seconds when Drew Allar's incredible interception gave Notre Dame a chance at a game-winning field goal and sealed the Irish's spot in the National Championship. With this historic performance and Freeman's impressive tenure at Notre Dame, it's only natural that NFL teams are taking notice. If Freeman leads Notre Dame to a national championship, there's a good chance he could make the jump to the NFL as early as next season. Currently, six teams - the Jets, Patriots, Raiders, Jaguars, Saints and Bears - are without a head coach, and Freeman's age, coupled with his proven leadership, makes him an attractive candidate. For now, though, Freeman can celebrate his 39th birthday and focus on preparing his team for the biggest game of the year. The National Championship will be played on January 20 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, home of the Atlanta Falcons. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved. Follow us",

                "content": "The Longhorn or British Longhorn is a British breed of beef cattle characterised by long curving horns. It originated in northern England, in the counties of Lancashire, Westmorland and Yorkshire, and later spread to the English Midlands and to Ireland.[4]: 49 It was originally a slow heavy draught animal; cows gave a little milk, although high in fat. In the eighteenth century Robert Bakewell applied his methods of selective breeding to these cattle, which for a short time became the predominant British breed.[5]: 232 [6]: 32 Both the numbers and the quality of the breed declined throughout the nineteenth century and for much of the twentieth.

In the eighteenth century Robert Bakewell, of Dishley in Leicestershire, applied his methods of selective breeding to these cattle; his \"Dishley Longhorn\" was highly successful, and for a short time became the predominant British breed.[5]: 232 After his death in 1795 it began to decline, and within a short time was supplanted by the Shorthorn as the principal breed in the country. Both the numbers and the quality of the breed decreased throughout the nineteenth century and for much of the twentieth.

They are present in Australia, and there are small numbers in Holland[7] and New Zealand.[8] A population in Belgium appears to have become extinct.[7] The cattle are variable in colour, but are always finched – with a heavy line of white along the spine, tail and underside of the belly.[5]: 232 The Longhorn was originally a slow heavy draught animal, used for ploughing; the milk yield was not high, but the milk was rich in fat and from the eighteenth century was used for cheese-making, particularly in Cheshire.[5]: 232 As with other draught breeds, oxen at the end of their working lives could be fattened and sent for slaughter.[9]: 40 In the twenty-first century the cattle are reared principally for beef.[5]: 232 They are also used for vegetation management in nature parks and Sites of Special Scientific Interest.[10]",

                "content": "English Longhorns (also known as Longhorns) are not related to the American or Texas Longhorn whose ancestors came from Spain. They do have a long and fascinating history linked to that of the great livestock pioneer of the 1700's, Robert Bakewell of Dishley. The English Longhorn originated from the northern counties of England, it was used as a draught animal and its milk was used for butter and cheese. The creamy white horns were treasured by manufacturers of buttons, cups, cutlery and lamps. Fine slivers of clear horn were a poor mans' glass and many a household were grateful for the end product of these elegant long horns. The most usual method of cattle keeping in those early times would have been one or more animals belonging to an individual, kept on common grazing, which were served by a bull owned by the Lord of the Manor. It was all a most haphazard and unsatisfactory method. There was no possibility of an organised breeding programme being carried out. The peasant farmers had to put up with what the Lord provided. As a result, cattle were long in the leg, narrow bodied and coarse, ideally designed for the plough. Robert Bakewell (1725-1795), a man who was a revolutionary in the field of interbreeding became devoted to one aim - improving livestock to provide meat for the masses of people who went to work in towns in the Industrial Revolution. He took horned heifers and crossed them with a Westmoreland bull to create the Dishley Longhorn, now called the English Longhorn. Through this new and careful selection of cattle he improved the size and quality (specifically its quick growth and heavy hind quarters) of this breed which became widely produced throughout England and Ireland until it was surpassed by the Shorthorn in the 1800's. The breed declined rapidly for nearly 200 years and was becoming rare by the 1950's and 60's. The trend for producing cattle was increasingly cereal fed, housed cattle which pushed selection of cattle with shorter horns or polled to reduce injury. Thankfully it was rescued by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust in 1980. With the efforts of RBST and interest in extensively lean grass fed cattle it has made a dramatic comeback. In 1981 a pair of Longhorns won the much coveted 'Burke Trophy' in the Interbreed Cattle Championship of The Royal Show, and a Longhorn bull was Reserve Interbreed Beef Champion at the Royal Welsh Show in 1994. In 1999 a Longhorn took the Interbreed Native Championship in the Leicester Show and a Longhorn pair were Reserve native Interbreed at the Counties Show. English Longhorns are large lean beef cattle with an impressive sweep of horns that curve down to around the nose. These impressive horns are valued in the pedigree. The body may be any one of a wide range of brindle colours (including colours from red to grey) but they all have the characteristic white line or \"finching\" along the back and down the tail, which is passed onto their cross bred progeny. Cows range in height from 130 to 140cm and weigh 500 to 600kg. Males average 150 cm in height and 1000 kg in weight. English Longhorn is renowned for its ease of calving. Prominent hook bones, deep pins and a roomy birth canal result in almost no recorded incidence of assistance being needed at birth. Longhorns have excellent milking ability and their long and level lactation help avoid a flush of milk at calving. They rear their calves very well. A 6% butter fat is not uncommon although no-one is currently milking them commercially. They are excellent mothers and their docile nature makes them an easy breed to manage. Their breeding, longevity and relatively low body weight makes them very economical and inexpensive to feed. A number of butchers are now stocking Longhorn beef as one of their traceable, quality products. The beef has a velvet texture and tastes delicious. The Longhorn is noted for its “feed responsive milk supply”. It is well known that it is the butterfat element of the milk which gives “bloom” to suckled calves. The Longhorn was renowned for the high butterfat of its milk which, in days gone by, was used in the making of famous cheeses like Stilton and Red Leicester. The lactation is long and level which helps to avoid a flush of milk at calving when the newborn calf cannot cope. The combination of prominent hook bones with wide deep pin bones, whilst still retaining a level top line, produces a roomy birth canal at the right angle to minimise calving problems. This means that a Longhorn or Longhorn Cross Cow when put to a continental bull experiences little or no calving difficulties and thus forms a highly efficient, productive and profitable unit. She is an adaptable long-lived cow that can produce and rear big, growthy calves to any breed of bull. Longhorn cows live to an unusually old age – and keep on breeding. Their hardiness and thriftiness together with their level lactation and ease of calving ensure that they do not place themselves under undue stress. Whilst their horns may, to some, give an opposite impression Longhorns are noted for their exceptional docility. The great overall length generally associated with the Longhorn is correlated with a rapid growth rate and lean carcase. It is a well established fact that intramuscular fat or “marbling” within meat is largely responsible for succulence, tenderness and flavour – the hallmark of beef with superior eating quality. Unlike many rival breeds, which require the laying down of excessive amounts of external fat before the formation of intramuscular fat can take place, a properly finished Longhorn carcase will benefit from “marbling” without such excess external fat cover. Today’s Longhorns are clean, modern cattle, well capable of producing lean beef with superior eating qualities to suit today’s discerning market. The English Longhorn is growing in popularity and can be found in the UK, Ireland, Germany, Australia and New Zealand.

                "title": "Earthquake - Wikipedia",
                "content": "An earthquake – also called a quake, tremor, or temblor – is the shaking of the Earth's surface resulting from a sudden release of energy in the lithosphere that creates seismic waves. Earthquakes can range in intensity, from those so weak they cannot be felt, to those violent enough to propel objects and people into the air, damage critical infrastructure, and wreak destruction across entire cities. The seismic activity of an area is the frequency, type, and size of earthquakes experienced over a particular time. The seismicity at a particular location in the Earth is the average rate of seismic energy release per unit volume. In its most general sense, the word earthquake is used to describe any seismic event that generates seismic waves. Earthquakes can occur naturally or be induced by human activities, such as mining, fracking, and nuclear tests. The initial point of rupture is called the hypocenter or focus, while the ground level directly above it is the epicenter. Earthquakes are primarily caused by geological faults, but also by volcanic activity, landslides, and other seismic events. The frequency, type, and size of earthquakes in an area define its seismic activity, reflecting the average rate of seismic energy release. Significant historical earthquakes include the 1556 Shaanxi earthquake in China, with over 830,000 fatalities, and the 1960 Valdivia earthquake in Chile, the largest ever recorded at 9.5 magnitude. Earthquakes result in various effects, such as ground shaking and soil liquefaction, leading to significant damage and loss of life. When the epicenter of a large earthquake is located offshore, the seabed may be displaced sufficiently to cause a tsunami. Earthquakes can trigger landslides. Earthquakes' occurrence is influenced by tectonic movements along faults, including normal, reverse (thrust), and strike-slip faults, with energy release and rupture dynamics governed by the elastic-rebound theory. Efforts to manage earthquake risks involve prediction, forecasting, and preparedness, including seismic retrofitting and earthquake engineering to design structures that withstand shaking. The cultural impact of earthquakes spans myths, religious beliefs, and modern media, reflecting their profound influence on human societies. Similar seismic phenomena, known as marsquakes and moonquakes, have been observed on other celestial bodies, indicating the universality of such events beyond Earth. An earthquake is the shaking of the surface of Earth resulting from a sudden release of energy in the lithosphere that creates seismic waves. Earthquakes may also be referred to as quakes, tremors, or temblors. The word tremor is also used for non-earthquake seismic rumbling. In its most general sense, an earthquake is any seismic event—whether natural or caused by humans—that generates seismic waves. Earthquakes are caused mostly by the rupture of geological faults but also by other events such as volcanic activity, landslides, mine blasts, fracking and nuclear tests. An earthquake's point of initial rupture is called its hypocenter or focus. The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter. The seismic activity of an area is the frequency, type, and size of earthquakes experienced over a particular time. The seismicity at a particular location in the Earth is the average rate of seismic energy release per unit volume. One of the most devastating earthquakes in recorded history was the 1556 Shaanxi earthquake, which occurred on 23 January 1556 in Shaanxi, China. More than 830,000 people died.[2] Most houses in the area were yaodongs—dwellings carved out of loess hillsides—and many victims were killed when these structures collapsed. The 1976 Tangshan earthquake, which killed between 240,000 and 655,000 people, was the deadliest of the 20th century.[3] The 1960 Chilean earthquake is the largest earthquake that has been measured on a seismograph, reaching 9.5 magnitude on 22 May 1960.[4][5] Its epicenter was near Cañete, Chile. The energy released was approximately twice that of the next most powerful earthquake, the Good Friday earthquake (27 March 1964), which was centered in Prince William Sound, Alaska.[6][7] The ten largest recorded earthquakes have all been megathrust earthquakes; however, of these ten, only the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake is simultaneously one of the deadliest earthquakes in history. Earthquakes that caused the greatest loss of life, while powerful, were deadly because of their proximity to either heavily populated areas or the ocean, where earthquakes often create tsunamis that can devastate communities thousands of kilometers away. Regions most at risk for great loss of life include those where earthquakes are relatively rare but powerful, and poor regions with lax, unenforced, or nonexistent seismic building codes. Tectonic earthquakes occur anywhere on the earth where there is sufficient stored elastic strain energy to drive fracture propagation along a fault plane. The sides of a fault move past each other smoothly and aseismically only if there are no irregularities or asperities along the fault surface that increases the frictional resistance. Most fault surfaces do have such asperities, which leads to a form of stick-slip behavior. Once the fault has locked, continued relative motion between the plates leads to increasing stress and, therefore, stored strain energy in the volume around the fault surface. This continues until the stress has risen sufficiently to break through the asperity, suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault, releasing the stored energy.[8] This energy is released as a combination of radiated elastic strain seismic waves,[9] frictional heating of the fault surface, and cracking of the rock, thus causing an earthquake. This process of gradual build-up of strain and stress punctuated by occasional sudden earthquake failure is referred to as the elastic-rebound theory. It is estimated that only 10 percent or less of an earthquake's total energy is radiated as seismic energy. Most of the earthquake's energy is used to power the earthquake fracture growth or is converted into heat generated by friction. Therefore, earthquakes lower the Earth's available elastic potential energy and raise its temperature, though these changes are negligible compared to the conductive and convective flow of heat out from the Earth's deep interior.[10] There are three main types of fault, all of which may cause an interplate earthquake: normal, reverse (thrust), and strike-slip. Normal and reverse faulting are examples of dip-slip, where the displacement along the fault is in the direction of dip and where movement on them involves a vertical component. Many earthquakes are caused by movement on faults that have components of both dip-slip and strike-slip; this is known as oblique slip. The topmost, brittle part of the Earth's crust, and the cool slabs of the tectonic plates that are descending into the hot mantle, are the only parts of our planet that can store elastic energy and release it in fault ruptures. Rocks hotter than about 300 °C (572 °F) flow in response to stress; they do not rupture in earthquakes.[11][12] The maximum observed lengths of ruptures and mapped faults (which may break in a single rupture) are approximately 1,000 km (620 mi). Examples are the earthquakes in Alaska (1957), Chile (1960), and Sumatra (2004), all in subduction zones. The longest earthquake ruptures on strike-slip faults, like the San Andreas Fault (1857, 1906), the North Anatolian Fault in Turkey (1939), and the Denali Fault in Alaska (2002), are about half to one third as long as the lengths along subducting plate margins, and those along normal faults are even shorter. Normal faults occur mainly in areas where the crust is being extended such as a divergent boundary. Earthquakes associated with normal faults are generally less than magnitude 7. Maximum magnitudes along many normal faults are even more limited because many of them are located along spreading centers, as in Iceland, where the thickness of the brittle layer is only about six kilometres (3.7 mi).[13][14] Reverse faults occur in areas where the crust is being shortened such as at a convergent boundary. Reverse faults, particularly those along convergent boundaries, are associated with the most powerful earthquakes (called megathrust earthquakes) including almost all of those of magnitude 8 or more. Megathrust earthquakes are responsible for about 90% of the total seismic moment released worldwide.[15] Strike-slip faults are steep structures where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other; transform boundaries are a particular type of strike-slip fault. Strike-slip faults, particularly continental transforms, can produce major earthquakes up to about magnitude 8. Strike-slip faults tend to be oriented near vertically, resulting in an approximate width of 10 km (6.2 mi) within the brittle crust.[16] Thus, earthquakes with magnitudes much larger than 8 are not possible. In addition, there exists a hierarchy of stress levels in the three fault types. Thrust faults are generated by the highest, strike-slip by intermediate, and normal faults by the lowest stress levels.[17] This can easily be understood by considering the direction of the greatest principal stress, the direction of the force that \"pushes\" the rock mass during the faulting. In the case of normal faults, the rock mass is pushed down in a vertical direction, thus the pushing force (greatest principal stress) equals the weight of the rock mass itself. In the case of thrusting, the rock mass \"escapes\" in the direction of the least principal stress, namely upward, lifting the rock mass, and thus, the overburden equals the least principal stress. Strike-slip faulting is intermediate between the other two types described above. This difference in stress regime in the three faulting environments can contribute to differences in stress drop during faulting, which contributes to differences in the radiated energy, regardless of fault dimensions. For every unit increase in magnitude, there is a roughly thirty-fold increase in the energy released. For instance, an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 releases approximately 32 times more energy than a 5.0 magnitude earthquake and a 7.0 magnitude earthquake releases 1,000 times more energy than a 5.0 magnitude earthquake. An 8.6-magnitude earthquake releases the same amount of energy as 10,000 atomic bombs of the size used in World War II.[18] This is so because the energy released in an earthquake, and thus its magnitude, is proportional to the area of the fault that ruptures[19] and the stress drop. Therefore, the longer the length and the wider the width of the faulted area, the larger the resulting magnitude. The most important parameter controlling the maximum earthquake magnitude on a fault, however, is not the maximum available length, but the available width because the latter varies by a factor of 20. Along converging plate margins, the dip angle of the rupture plane is very shallow, typically about 10 degrees.[20] Thus, the width of the plane within the top brittle crust of the Earth can reach 50–100 km (31–62 mi) (such as in Japan, 2011, or in Alaska, 1964), making the most powerful earthquakes possible. The majority of tectonic earthquakes originate in the Ring of Fire at depths not exceeding tens of kilometers. Earthquakes occurring at a depth of less than 70 km (43 mi) are classified as \"shallow-focus\" earthquakes, while those with a focal depth between 70 and 300 km (43 and 186 mi) are commonly termed \"mid-focus\" or \"intermediate-depth\" earthquakes. In subduction zones, where older and colder oceanic crust descends beneath another tectonic plate, deep-focus earthquakes may occur at much greater depths (ranging from 300 to 700 km (190 to 430 mi)).[21] These seismically active areas of subduction are known as Wadati–Benioff zones. Deep-focus earthquakes occur at a depth where the subducted lithosphere should no longer be brittle, due to the high temperature and pressure. A possible mechanism for the generation of deep-focus earthquakes is faulting caused by olivine undergoing a phase transition into a spinel structure.[22] Earthquakes often occur in volcanic regions and are caused there, both by tectonic faults and the movement of magma in volcanoes. Such earthquakes can serve as an early warning of volcanic eruptions, as during the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens.[23] Earthquake swarms can serve as markers for the location of the flowing magma throughout the volcanoes. These swarms can be recorded by seismometers and tiltmeters (a device that measures ground slope) and used as sensors to predict imminent or upcoming eruptions.[24] A tectonic earthquake begins as an area of initial slip on the fault surface that forms the focus. Once the rupture has been initiated, it begins to propagate away from the focus, spreading out along the fault surface. Lateral propagation will continue until either the rupture reaches a barrier, such as the end of a fault segment, or a region on the fault where there is insufficient stress to allow continued rupture. For larger earthquakes, the depth extent of rupture will be constrained downwards by the brittle-ductile transition zone and upwards by the ground surface. The mechanics of this process are poorly understood because it is difficult either to recreate such rapid movements in a laboratory or to record seismic waves close to a nucleation zone due to strong ground motion.[25] In most cases, the rupture speed approaches, but does not exceed, the shear wave (S wave) velocity of the surrounding rock. There are a few exceptions to this: Supershear earthquake ruptures are known to have propagated at speeds greater than the S wave velocity. These have so far all been observed during large strike-slip events. The unusually wide zone of damage caused by the 2001 Kunlun earthquake has been attributed to the effects of the sonic boom developed in such earthquakes. Slow earthquake ruptures travel at unusually low velocities. A particularly dangerous form of slow earthquake is the tsunami earthquake, observed where the relatively low felt intensities, caused by the slow propagation speed of some great earthquakes, fail to alert the population of the neighboring coast, as in the 1896 Sanriku earthquake.[25] During an earthquake, high temperatures can develop at the fault plane, increasing pore pressure and consequently vaporization of the groundwater already contained within the rock.[27][28][29] In the coseismic phase, such an increase can significantly affect slip evolution and speed, in the post-seismic phase it can control the Aftershock sequence because, after the main event, pore pressure increase slowly propagates into the surrounding fracture network.[30][29] From the point of view of the Mohr-Coulomb strength theory, an increase in fluid pressure reduces the normal stress acting on the fault plane that holds it in place, and fluids can exert a lubricating effect. As thermal overpressurization may provide positive feedback between slip and strength fall at the fault plane, a common opinion is that it may enhance the faulting process instability. After the mainshock, the pressure gradient between the fault plane and the neighboring rock causes a fluid flow that increases pore pressure in the surrounding fracture networks; such an increase may trigger new faulting processes by reactivating adjacent faults, giving rise to aftershocks.[30][29] Analogously, artificial pore pressure increase, by fluid injection in Earth's crust, may induce seismicity. Tides may trigger some seismicity. Most earthquakes form part of a sequence, related to each other in terms of location and time.[31] Most earthquake clusters consist of small tremors that cause little to no damage, but there is a theory that earthquakes can recur in a regular pattern.[32] Earthquake clustering has been observed, for example, in Parkfield, California where a long-term research study is being conducted around the Parkfield earthquake cluster.[33] An aftershock is an earthquake that occurs after a previous earthquake, the mainshock. Rapid changes of stress between rocks, and the stress from the original earthquake are the main causes of these aftershocks,[34] along with the crust around the ruptured fault plane as it adjusts to the effects of the mainshock.[31] An aftershock is in the same region as the main shock but always of a smaller magnitude, however, they can still be powerful enough to cause even more damage to buildings that were already previously damaged from the mainshock.[34] If an aftershock is larger than the mainshock, the aftershock is redesignated as the mainshock and the original main shock is redesignated as a foreshock. Aftershocks are formed as the crust around the displaced fault plane adjusts to the effects of the mainshock.[31] Earthquake swarms are sequences of earthquakes striking in a specific area within a short period. They are different from earthquakes followed by a series of aftershocks by the fact that no single earthquake in the sequence is the main shock, so none has a notably higher magnitude than another. An example of an earthquake swarm is the 2004 activity at Yellowstone National Park.[35] In August 2012, a swarm of earthquakes shook Southern California's Imperial Valley, showing the most recorded activity in the area since the 1970s.[36] Sometimes a series of earthquakes occur in what has been called an earthquake storm, where the earthquakes strike a fault in clusters, each triggered by the shaking or stress redistribution of the previous earthquakes. Similar to aftershocks but on adjacent segments of fault, these storms occur over the course of years, with some of the later earthquakes as damaging as the early ones. Such a pattern was observed in the sequence of about a dozen earthquakes that struck the North Anatolian Fault in Turkey in the 20th century and has been inferred for older anomalous clusters of large earthquakes in the Middle East.[37][38] It is estimated that around 500,000 earthquakes occur each year, detectable with current instrumentation. About 100,000 of these can be felt.[4][5] Minor earthquakes occur very frequently around the world in places like California and Alaska in the U.S., as well as in El Salvador, Mexico, Guatemala, Chile, Peru, Indonesia, the Philippines, Iran, Pakistan, the Azores in Portugal, Turkey, New Zealand, Greece, Italy, India, Nepal, and Japan.[40] Larger earthquakes occur less frequently, the relationship being exponential; for example, roughly ten times as many earthquakes larger than magnitude 4 occur than earthquakes larger than magnitude 5.[41] In the (low seismicity) United Kingdom, for example, it has been calculated that the average recurrences are: an earthquake of 3.7–4.6 every year, an earthquake of 4.7–5.5 every 10 years, and an earthquake of 5.6 or larger every 100 years.[42] This is an example of the Gutenberg–Richter law. The number of seismic stations has increased from about 350 in 1931 to many thousands today. As a result, many more earthquakes are reported than in the past, but this is because of the vast improvement in instrumentation, rather than an increase in the number of earthquakes. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimates that, since 1900, there have been an average of 18 major earthquakes (magnitude 7.0–7.9) and one great earthquake (magnitude 8.0 or greater) per year, and that this average has been relatively stable.[43] In recent years, the number of major earthquakes per year has decreased, though this is probably a statistical fluctuation rather than a systematic trend.[44] More detailed statistics on the size and frequency of earthquakes is available from the United States Geological Survey.[45] A recent increase in the number of major earthquakes has been noted, which could be explained by a cyclical pattern of periods of intense tectonic activity, interspersed with longer periods of low intensity. However, accurate recordings of earthquakes only began in the early 1900s, so it is too early to categorically state that this is the case.[46] Most of the world's earthquakes (90%, and 81% of the largest) take place in the 40,000-kilometre-long (25,000 mi), horseshoe-shaped zone called the circum-Pacific seismic belt, known as the Pacific Ring of Fire, which for the most part bounds the Pacific plate.[47][48] Massive earthquakes tend to occur along other plate boundaries too, such as along the Himalayan Mountains.[49] With the rapid growth of mega-cities such as Mexico City, Tokyo, and Tehran in areas of high seismic risk, some seismologists are warning that a single earthquake may claim the lives of up to three million people.[50] While most earthquakes are caused by the movement of the Earth's tectonic plates, human activity can also produce earthquakes. Activities both above ground and below may change the stresses and strains on the crust, including building reservoirs, extracting resources such as coal or oil, and injecting fluids underground for waste disposal or fracking.[51] Most of these earthquakes have small magnitudes. The 5.7 magnitude 2011 Oklahoma earthquake is thought to have been caused by disposing wastewater from oil production into injection wells,[52] and studies point to the state's oil industry as the cause of other earthquakes in the past century.[53] A Columbia University paper suggested that the 8.0 magnitude 2008 Sichuan earthquake was induced by loading from the Zipingpu Dam,[54] though the link has not been conclusively proved.[55] The instrumental scales used to describe the size of an earthquake began with the Richter scale in the 1930s. It is a relatively simple measurement of an event's amplitude, and its use has become minimal in the 21st century. Seismic waves travel through the Earth's interior and can be recorded by seismometers at great distances. The surface-wave magnitude was developed in the 1950s as a means to measure remote earthquakes and to improve the accuracy for larger events. The moment magnitude scale not only measures the amplitude of the shock but also takes into account the seismic moment (total rupture area, average slip of the fault, and rigidity of the rock). The Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale, the Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale, and the Mercalli intensity scale are based on the observed effects and are related to the intensity of shaking. The shaking of the earth is a common phenomenon that has been experienced by humans from the earliest of times. Before the development of strong-motion accelerometers, the intensity of a seismic event was estimated based on the observed effects. Magnitude and intensity are not directly related and calculated using different methods. The magnitude of an earthquake is a single value that describes the size of the earthquake at its source. Intensity is the measure of shaking at different locations around the earthquake. Intensity values vary from place to place, depending on the distance from the earthquake and the underlying rock or soil makeup.[56] The first scale for measuring earthquake magnitudes was developed by Charles Francis Richter in 1935. Subsequent scales (seismic magnitude scales) have retained a key feature, where each unit represents a ten-fold difference in the amplitude of the ground shaking and a 32-fold difference in energy. Subsequent scales are also adjusted to have approximately the same numeric value within the limits of the scale.[57] Although the mass media commonly reports earthquake magnitudes as \"Richter magnitude\" or \"Richter scale\", standard practice by most seismological authorities is to express an earthquake's strength on the moment magnitude scale, which is based on the actual energy released by an earthquake, the static seismic moment.[58][59] Every earthquake produces different types of seismic waves, which travel through rock with different velocities: Propagation velocity of the seismic waves through solid rock ranges from approx. 3 km/s (1.9 mi/s) up to 13 km/s (8.1 mi/s), depending on the density and elasticity of the medium. In the Earth's interior, the shock- or P waves travel much faster than the S waves (approx. relation 1.7:1). The differences in travel time from the epicenter to the observatory are a measure of the distance and can be used to image both sources of earthquakes and structures within the Earth. Also, the depth of the hypocenter can be computed roughly. P wave speed S waves speed As a consequence, the first waves of a distant earthquake arrive at an observatory via the Earth's mantle. On average, the kilometer distance to the earthquake is the number of seconds between the P- and S wave times 8.[60] Slight deviations are caused by inhomogeneities of subsurface structure. By such analysis of seismograms, the Earth's core was located in 1913 by Beno Gutenberg. S waves and later arriving surface waves do most of the damage compared to P waves. P waves squeeze and expand the material in the same direction they are traveling, whereas S waves shake the ground up and down and back and forth.[61] Earthquakes are not only categorized by their magnitude but also by the place where they occur. The world is divided into 754 Flinn–Engdahl regions (F-E regions), which are based on political and geographical boundaries as well as seismic activity. More active zones are divided into smaller F-E regions whereas less active zones belong to larger F-E regions. Standard reporting of earthquakes includes its magnitude, date and time of occurrence, geographic coordinates of its epicenter, depth of the epicenter, geographical region, distances to population centers, location uncertainty, several parameters that are included in USGS earthquake reports (number of stations reporting, number of observations, etc.), and a unique event ID.[62] Although relatively slow seismic waves have traditionally been used to detect earthquakes, scientists realized in 2016 that gravitational measurement could provide instantaneous detection of earthquakes, and confirmed this by analyzing gravitational records associated with the 2011 Tohoku-Oki (\"Fukushima\") earthquake.[63][64] The effects of earthquakes include, but are not limited to, the following: Shaking and ground rupture are the main effects created by earthquakes, principally resulting in more or less severe damage to buildings and other rigid structures. The severity of the local effects depends on the complex combination of the earthquake magnitude, the distance from the epicenter, and the local geological and geomorphological conditions, which may amplify or reduce wave propagation.[65] The ground-shaking is measured by ground acceleration. Specific local geological, geomorphological, and geostructural features can induce high levels of shaking on the ground surface even from low-intensity earthquakes. This effect is called site or local amplification. It is principally due to the transfer of the seismic motion from hard deep soils to soft superficial soils and the effects of seismic energy focalization owing to the typical geometrical setting of such deposits. Ground rupture is a visible breaking and displacement of the Earth's surface along the trace of the fault, which may be of the order of several meters in the case of major earthquakes. Ground rupture is a major risk for large engineering structures such as dams, bridges, and nuclear power stations and requires careful mapping of existing faults to identify any that are likely to break the ground surface within the life of the structure.[66] Soil liquefaction occurs when, because of the shaking, water-saturated granular material (such as sand) temporarily loses its strength and transforms from a solid to a liquid. Soil liquefaction may cause rigid structures, like buildings and bridges, to tilt or sink into the liquefied deposits. For example, in the 1964 Alaska earthquake, soil liquefaction caused many buildings to sink into the ground, eventually collapsing upon themselves.[67] Physical damage from an earthquake will vary depending on the intensity of shaking in a given area and the type of population. Underserved and developing communities frequently experience more severe impacts (and longer lasting) from a seismic event compared to well-developed communities.[68] Impacts may include: With these impacts and others, the aftermath may bring disease, a lack of basic necessities, mental consequences such as panic attacks and depression to survivors,[69] and higher insurance premiums. Recovery times will vary based on the level of damage and the socioeconomic status of the impacted community. Earthquakes can produce slope instability leading to landslides, a major geological hazard. Landslide danger may persist while emergency personnel is attempting rescue work.[70] Earthquakes can cause fires by damaging electrical power or gas lines. In the event of water mains rupturing and a loss of pressure, it may also become difficult to stop the spread of a fire once it has started. For example, more deaths in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake were caused by fire than by the earthquake itself.[71] Tsunamis are long-wavelength, long-period sea waves produced by the sudden or abrupt movement of large volumes of water—including when an earthquake occurs at sea. In the open ocean, the distance between wave crests can surpass 100 kilometres (62 mi), and the wave periods can vary from five minutes to one hour. Such tsunamis travel 600–800 kilometers per hour (373–497 miles per hour), depending on water depth. Large waves produced by an earthquake or a submarine landslide can overrun nearby coastal areas in a matter of minutes. Tsunamis can also travel thousands of kilometers across open ocean and wreak destruction on far shores hours after the earthquake that generated them.[72] Ordinarily, subduction earthquakes under magnitude 7.5 do not cause tsunamis, although some instances of this have been recorded. Most destructive tsunamis are caused by earthquakes of magnitude 7.5 or more.[72] Floods may be secondary effects of earthquakes if dams are damaged. Earthquakes may cause landslips to dam rivers, which collapse and cause floods.[73] The terrain below the Sarez Lake in Tajikistan is in danger of catastrophic flooding if the landslide dam formed by the earthquake, known as the Usoi Dam, were to fail during a future earthquake. Impact projections suggest the flood could affect roughly five million people.[74] Earthquake prediction is a branch of the science of seismology concerned with the specification of the time, location, and magnitude of future earthquakes within stated limits.[75] Many methods have been developed for predicting the time and place in which earthquakes will occur. Despite considerable research efforts by seismologists, scientifically reproducible predictions cannot yet be made to a specific day or month.[76] Popular belief holds earthquakes are preceded by earthquake weather, in the early morning.[77][78] While forecasting is usually considered to be a type of prediction, earthquake forecasting is often differentiated from earthquake prediction. Earthquake forecasting is concerned with the probabilistic assessment of general earthquake hazards, including the frequency and magnitude of damaging earthquakes in a given area over years or decades.[79] For well-understood faults the probability that a segment may rupture during the next few decades can be estimated.[80][81] Earthquake warning systems have been developed that can provide regional notification of an earthquake in progress, but before the ground surface has begun to move, potentially allowing people within the system's range to seek shelter before the earthquake's impact is felt. The objective of earthquake engineering is to foresee the impact of earthquakes on buildings, bridges, tunnels, roadways, and other structures, and to design such structures to minimize the risk of damage. Existing structures can be modified by seismic retrofitting to improve their resistance to earthquakes. Earthquake insurance can provide building owners with financial protection against losses resulting from earthquakes. Emergency management strategies can be employed by a government or organization to mitigate risks and prepare for consequences. Artificial intelligence may help to assess buildings and plan precautionary operations. The Igor expert system is part of a mobile laboratory that supports the procedures leading to the seismic assessment of masonry buildings and the planning of retrofitting operations on them. It has been applied to assess buildings in Lisbon, Rhodes, and Naples.[82] Individuals can also take preparedness steps like securing water heaters and heavy items that could injure someone, locating shutoffs for utilities, and being educated about what to do when the shaking starts. For areas near large bodies of water, earthquake preparedness encompasses the possibility of a tsunami caused by a large earthquake. From the lifetime of the Greek philosopher Anaxagoras in the 5th century BCE to the 14th century CE, earthquakes were usually attributed to \"air (vapors) in the cavities of the Earth.\"[83] Thales of Miletus (625–547 BCE) was the only documented person who believed that earthquakes were caused by tension between the earth and water.[83] Other theories existed, including the Greek philosopher Anaxamines' (585–526 BCE) beliefs that short incline episodes of dryness and wetness caused seismic activity. The Greek philosopher Democritus (460–371 BCE) blamed water in general for earthquakes.[83] Pliny the Elder called earthquakes \"underground thunderstorms\".[83] In Norse mythology, earthquakes were explained as the violent struggle of the god Loki. When Loki, god of mischief and strife, murdered Baldr, god of beauty and light, he was punished by being bound in a cave with a poisonous serpent placed above his head dripping venom. Loki's wife Sigyn stood by him with a bowl to catch the poison, but whenever she had to empty the bowl, the poison dripped on Loki's face, forcing him to jerk his head away and thrash against his bonds, which caused the earth to tremble.[84] In Greek mythology, Poseidon was the cause and god of earthquakes. When he was in a bad mood, he struck the ground with a trident, causing earthquakes and other calamities. He also used earthquakes to punish and inflict fear upon people as revenge.[85] In Japanese mythology, Namazu (鯰) is a giant catfish who causes earthquakes. Namazu lives in the mud beneath the earth and is guarded by the god Kashima, who restrains the fish with a stone. When Kashima lets his guard fall, Namazu thrashes about, causing violent earthquakes.[86] In the New Testament, Matthew's Gospel refers to earthquakes occurring both after the death of Jesus (Matthew 27:51, 54) and at his resurrection (Matthew 28:2).[87] Earthquakes form part of the picture through which Jesus portrays the beginning of the end of time.[88] In modern popular culture, the portrayal of earthquakes is shaped by the memory of great cities laid waste, such as Kobe in 1995 or San Francisco in 1906.[89] Fictional earthquakes tend to strike suddenly and without warning.[89] For this reason, stories about earthquakes generally begin with the disaster and focus on its immediate aftermath, as in Short Walk to Daylight (1972), The Ragged Edge (1968) or Aftershock: Earthquake in New York (1999).[89] A notable example is Heinrich von Kleist's classic novella, The Earthquake in Chile, which describes the destruction of Santiago in 1647. Haruki Murakami's short fiction collection After the Quake depicts the consequences of the Kobe earthquake of 1995. The most popular single earthquake in fiction is the hypothetical \"Big One\" expected of California's San Andreas Fault someday, as depicted in the novels Richter 10 (1996), Goodbye California (1977), 2012 (2009), and San Andreas (2015), among other works.[89] Jacob M. Appel's widely anthologized short story, A Comparative Seismology, features a con artist who convinces an elderly woman that an apocalyptic earthquake is imminent.[90] Contemporary depictions of earthquakes in film are variable in the manner in which they reflect human psychological reactions to the actual trauma that can be caused to directly afflicted families and their loved ones.[91] Disaster mental health response research emphasizes the need to be aware of the different roles of loss of family and key community members, loss of home and familiar surroundings, and loss of essential supplies and services to maintain survival.[92][93] Particularly for children, the clear availability of caregiving adults who can protect, nourish, and clothe them in the aftermath of the earthquake and help them make sense of what has befallen them is more important to their emotional and physical health than the simple giving of provisions.[94] As was observed after other disasters involving destruction and loss of life and their media depictions, recently observed in the 2010 Haiti earthquake, it is also believed to be important not to pathologize the reactions to loss and displacement or disruption of governmental administration and services, but rather to validate the reactions to support constructive problem-solving and reflection.[95] Phenomena similar to earthquakes have been observed on other planets (e.g., marsquakes on Mars) and on the Moon (e.g., moonquakes).",

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Over the centuries, earthquakes have been responsible for millions of deaths and an incalculable amount of damage to property. Depending on their intensity, earthquakes (specifically, the degree to which they cause the ground’s surface to shake) can topple buildings and bridges, rupture gas pipelines and other infrastructure, and trigger landslides, tsunamis, and volcanoes. These phenomena are primarily responsible for deaths and injuries. Very great earthquakes occur on average about once per year. Earthquake waves, more commonly known as seismic waves, are vibrations generated by an earthquake and propagated within Earth or along its surface. There are four principal types of elastic waves: two, primary and secondary waves, travel within Earth, whereas the other two, Rayleigh and Love waves, called surface waves, travel along its surface. In addition, seismic waves can be produced artificially by explosions. Magnitude is a measure of the amplitude (height) of the seismic waves an earthquake’s source produces as recorded by seismographs. Seismologist Charles F. Richter created an earthquake magnitude scale using the logarithm of the largest seismic wave’s amplitude to base 10. Richter’s scale was originally for measuring the magnitude of earthquakes from magnitudes 3 to 7, limiting its usefulness. Today the moment magnitude scale, a closer measure of an earthquake’s total energy release, is preferred. Earthquakes can occur anywhere, but they occur mainly along fault lines (planar or curved fractures in the rocks of Earth’s crust), where compressional or tensional forces move rocks on opposite sides of a fracture. Faults extend from a few centimetres to many hundreds of kilometres. In addition, most of the world’s earthquakes occur within the Ring of Fire, a long horseshoe-shaped belt of earthquake epicentres, volcanoes, and tectonic plate boundaries fringing the Pacific basin. earthquake, any sudden shaking of the ground caused by the passage of seismic waves through Earth’s rocks. Seismic waves are produced when some form of energy stored in Earth’s crust is suddenly released, usually when masses of rock straining against one another suddenly fracture and “slip.” Earthquakes occur most often along geologic faults, narrow zones where rock masses move in relation to one another. The major fault lines of the world are located at the fringes of the huge tectonic plates that make up Earth’s crust. (See the table of major earthquakes.) Little was understood about earthquakes until the emergence of seismology at the beginning of the 20th century. Seismology, which involves the scientific study of all aspects of earthquakes, has yielded answers to such long-standing questions as why and how earthquakes occur. About 50,000 earthquakes large enough to be noticed without the aid of instruments occur annually over the entire Earth. Of these, approximately 100 are of sufficient size to produce substantial damage if their centres are near areas of habitation. Very great earthquakes occur on average about once per year. Over the centuries they have been responsible for millions of deaths and an incalculable amount of damage to property. Earth’s major earthquakes occur mainly in belts coinciding with the margins of tectonic plates. This has long been apparent from early catalogs of felt earthquakes and is even more readily discernible in modern seismicity maps, which show instrumentally determined epicentres. The most important earthquake belt is the Circum-Pacific Belt, which affects many populated coastal regions around the Pacific Ocean—for example, those of New Zealand, New Guinea, Japan, the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, and the western coasts of North and South America. It is estimated that 80 percent of the energy presently released in earthquakes comes from those whose epicentres are in this belt. The seismic activity is by no means uniform throughout the belt, and there are a number of branches at various points. Because at many places the Circum-Pacific Belt is associated with volcanic activity, it has been popularly dubbed the “Pacific Ring of Fire.” A second belt, known as the Alpide Belt, passes through the Mediterranean region eastward through Asia and joins the Circum-Pacific Belt in the East Indies. The energy released in earthquakes from this belt is about 15 percent of the world total. There also are striking connected belts of seismic activity, mainly along oceanic ridges—including those in the Arctic Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, and the western Indian Ocean—and along the rift valleys of East Africa. This global seismicity distribution is best understood in terms of its plate tectonic setting. Earthquakes are caused by the sudden release of energy within some limited region of the rocks of the Earth. The energy can be released by elastic strain, gravity, chemical reactions, or even the motion of massive bodies. Of all these the release of elastic strain is the most important cause, because this form of energy is the only kind that can be stored in sufficient quantity in the Earth to produce major disturbances. Earthquakes associated with this type of energy release are called tectonic earthquakes.",

Latest Earthquakes | Chat Share Social Media Originally written by Lisa Wald (U.S. Geological Survey) for “The Green Frog News” An earthquake is what happens when two blocks of the earth suddenly slip past one another. The surface where they slip is called the fault or fault plane. The location below the earth’s surface where the earthquake starts is called the hypocenter, and the location directly above it on the surface of the earth is called the epicenter. Sometimes an earthquake has foreshocks. These are smaller earthquakes that happen in the same place as the larger earthquake that follows. Scientists can’t tell that an earthquake is a foreshock until the larger earthquake happens. The largest, main earthquake is called the mainshock. Mainshocks always have aftershocks that follow. These are smaller earthquakes that occur afterwards in the same place as the mainshock. Depending on the size of the mainshock, aftershocks can continue for weeks, months, and even years after the mainshock! The earth has four major layers: the inner core, outer core, mantle and crust. The crust and the top of the mantle make up a thin skin on the surface of our planet. But this skin is not all in one piece – it is made up of many pieces like a puzzle covering the surface of the earth. Not only that, but these puzzle pieces keep slowly moving around, sliding past one another and bumping into each other. We call these puzzle pieces tectonic plates, and the edges of the plates are called the plate boundaries. The plate boundaries are made up of many faults, and most of the earthquakes around the world occur on these faults. Since the edges of the plates are rough, they get stuck while the rest of the plate keeps moving. Finally, when the plate has moved far enough, the edges unstick on one of the faults and there is an earthquake. While the edges of faults are stuck together, and the rest of the block is moving, the energy that would normally cause the blocks to slide past one another is being stored up. When the force of the moving blocks finally overcomes the friction of the jagged edges of the fault and it unsticks, all that stored up energy is released. The energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions in the form of seismic waves like ripples on a pond. The seismic waves shake the earth as they move through it, and when the waves reach the earth’s surface, they shake the ground and anything on it, like our houses and us! Earthquakes are recorded by instruments called seismographs. The recording they make is called a seismogram. The seismograph has a base that sets firmly in the ground, and a heavy weight that hangs free. When an earthquake causes the ground to shake, the base of the seismograph shakes too, but the hanging weight does not. Instead the spring or string that it is hanging from absorbs all the movement. The difference in position between the shaking part of the seismograph and the motionless part is what is recorded. The size of an earthquake depends on the size of the fault and the amount of slip on the fault, but that’s not something scientists can simply measure with a measuring tape since faults are many kilometers deep beneath the earth’s surface. So how do they measure an earthquake? They use the seismogram recordings made on the seismographs at the surface of the earth to determine how large the earthquake was (figure 5). A short wiggly line that doesn’t wiggle very much means a small earthquake, and a long wiggly line that wiggles a lot means a large earthquake. The length of the wiggle depends on the size of the fault, and the size of the wiggle depends on the amount of slip. The size of the earthquake is called its magnitude. There is one magnitude for each earthquake. Scientists also talk about theintensity of shaking from an earthquake, and this varies depending on where you are during the earthquake. Seismograms come in handy for locating earthquakes too, and being able to see the P wave and the S wave is important. You learned how P & S waves each shake the ground in different ways as they travel through it. P waves are also faster than S waves, and this fact is what allows us to tell where an earthquake was. To understand how this works, let’s compare P and S waves to lightning and thunder. Light travels faster than sound, so during a thunderstorm you will first see the lightning and then you will hear the thunder. If you are close to the lightning, the thunder will boom right after the lightning, but if you are far away from the lightning, you can count several seconds before you hear the thunder. The further you are from the storm, the longer it will take between the lightning and the thunder. P waves are like the lightning, and S waves are like the thunder. The P waves travel faster and shake the ground where you are first. Then the S waves follow and shake the ground also. If you are close to the earthquake, the P and S wave will come one right after the other, but if you are far away, there will be more time between the two. By looking at the amount of time between the P and S wave on a seismogram recorded on a seismograph, scientists can tell how far away the earthquake was from that location. However, they can’t tell in what direction from the seismograph the earthquake was, only how far away it was. If they draw a circle on a map around the station where the radius of the circle is the determined distance to the earthquake, they know the earthquake lies somewhere on the circle. But where? Scientists then use a method called triangulation to determine exactly where the earthquake was (see image below). It is called triangulation because a triangle has three sides, and it takes three seismographs to locate an earthquake. If you draw a circle on a map around three different seismographs where the radius of each is the distance from that station to the earthquake, the intersection of those three circles is the epicenter! No, and it is unlikely they will ever be able to predict them. Scientists have tried many different ways of predicting earthquakes, but none have been successful. On any particular fault, scientists know there will be another earthquake sometime in the future, but they have no way of telling when it will happen. These are two questions that do not yet have definite answers. If weather does affect earthquake occurrence, or if some animals or people can tell when an earthquake is coming, we do not yet understand how it works. Children's Privacy Policy",

                "content": "An earthquake is when Earth's tectonic plates shake and move Earth's surface. Strong earthquakes damage buildings. Disturbances in the Earth cause earthquakes. Different tectonic plates are slowly moving. When they get stuck, tension builds up in them. Earthquakes occur when tectonic plates suddenly break free, so they start moving quickly. The first point of an earthquake's rupture is called its hypocenter or focus. The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter. People who study earthquakes are called seismologists. Many earthquakes can occur in a small area in a short period of time. The sudden release of stress in the tectonic plates sends waves of energy that travel through the Earth. Seismology studies the cause, recurrence, type and magnitude of earthquakes. The effect of an earthquake can be measured with a seismometer. A seismometer detects the tremors of the earth and plots the tremors on a seismograph. The strength or magnitude of an earthquake can be measured using the Richter scale. The Richter scale was invented by Charles Francis Richter in 1935. The scale is numbered 0-10. A 2 on this scale is a tremor that is not easily recorded. And damage of size 5 (or more) in a wide area. The largest earthquake ever measured had a magnitude of 9.5. No one can tell when an earthquake will happen. But we know where earthquakes are likely to occur in the future, such as near fault lines. An earthquake under the ocean can create a huge wave called a tsunami. Tsunamis can also cause a lot of destruction. Earthquake zones are concentrated in some parts of the world. The first is the Pacific belt, which circles the Pacific Ocean. This part is the biggest seismic belt: it has the most active earthquakes and the most volcanoes.[1] The second part is the Alpide belt. It includes the seismic activities from Sumatra, to the Himalayas, to south Europe and north Africa, to the Atlantic Ocean. These belts are along the edges of tectonic plates. The tectonic plates push on each other and make great amounts of tension. Earthquakes sometimes hit cities and kill hundreds or thousands of people. Most earthquakes happen along the Pacific Ring of Fire but the biggest ones mostly happen in other places. Tectonically active places are places where earthquakes or volcanic eruptions are regularly repeated. Earthquakes are caused by tectonic movements in the Earth's crust. The main cause is when tectonic plates ride one over the other, causing orogeny (mountain building), and severe earthquakes.[2] The boundaries between moving plates form the largest fault surfaces on Earth. When they stick, motion between the plates leads to increasing stress. This continues until the stress rises and breaks, suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault. This releases the stored energy as shock waves. The San Andreas fault in San Francisco, and Rift valley fault in Africa are faults like this. Earthquakes caused by volcanic eruptions can be quite devastating. However, these earthquakes are confined to areas around active volcanoes. Often the causes are not known, except in the most general terms. An example is the largest earthquake in the history of the United States: the 1811–1812 New Madrid earthquakes. These are described as caused by very deep shifts in ancient rock formations. In other words, the cause is not known in detail. In areas of intense mining activity, often the roofs of underground mines collapse and minor tremors take place. These are called collapse earthquakes. There are three main types of geological fault that may cause an earthquake: normal, reverse (thrust) and strike-slip. Normal faults occur mainly in areas where the crust is being extended. Reverse faults occur in areas where the crust is being shortened. Strike-slip faults are steep structures where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other. Most earthquakes form part of a sequence, related to each other in terms of location and time.[3] Most earthquake clusters consist of small tremors which cause little to no damage, but there is a theory that earthquakes can recur in a regular pattern.[4] A foreshock is an earthquake that happens before a larger earthquake, called the mainshock. An aftershock is an earthquake that happens after a previous earthquake, the mainshock. An aftershock is in the same place of the main shock but always of a smaller magnitude. Aftershocks are formed as the crust adjusts to the effects of the main shock.[3] Earthquake swarms are sequences of earthquakes striking in a specific area within a short period of time. They are different from earthquakes followed by a series of aftershocks by the fact that no single earthquake in the sequence is obviously the main shock, therefore none have notably higher magnitudes than the other. An example of an earthquake swarm is the 2004 activity at Yellowstone National Park.[5] Sometimes a series of earthquakes happen in a sort of earthquake storm, where the earthquakes strike a fault in clusters, each triggered by the shaking or stress redistribution of the previous earthquakes. Similar to aftershocks but on adjacent segments of fault, these storms happen over the course of years, and with some of the later earthquakes as damaging as the early ones. Such a pattern happened in the North Anatolian fault in Turkey in the 20th century.[6][7] A tsunami is a chain of fast moving waves in the ocean caused by powerful earthquakes. They are very serious challenges for people's safety and for earthquake engineering. Those waves can flood coastal areas, destroy houses and even swipe away whole towns.[8] This is a danger for the whole mankind. Unfortunately, tsunamis cannot be prevented. However, there are warning systems[9] which may warn the population before the big waves reach the land to let them enough time to rush to safety. Earthquake-proof buildings are constructed to withstand the destructive force of an earthquake. This depends upon its type of construction, shape, mass distribution, and rigidity. Different combinations are used. Square, rectangular, and shell-shaped buildings can withstand earthquakes better than skyscrapers. To reduce stress, a building's ground floor can be supported by extremely rigid, empty columns, while the rest of the building is supported by flexible columns inside the empty columns. Another method is to use rollers or rubber pads to separate the base columns from the ground, allowing the columns to shake parallel to each other during an earthquake. To help prevent a roof from collapsing, builders make the roof out of light-weight materials. Outdoor walls are made with stronger and more reinforced materials such as steel or reinforced concrete. During an earthquake, flexible windows may help hold the windows together so they don't break.",

                "content": "Archibald Charles Manning[2] (born April 27, 2005) is an American football quarterback for the Texas Longhorns. He is a member of the Manning family. Manning played high school football at Isidore Newman School in New Orleans. In his freshman year, Manning was the varsity starter at quarterback, the first freshman quarterback to start Newman's season opener in at least 40 years.[3] He shined in his debut, leading Newman to a 26-point victory.[4] In the final game of the season against Dunham, Manning threw for only 71 yards on 20 attempts and 10 completions. They would lose, 22–20.[5] Manning completed his freshman season with 2,509 yards and 34 touchdowns, earning MaxPreps National Freshman of the Year honors.[6] Manning opened his sophomore season by having six touchdowns against East Jefferson.[7] On October 15, 2020, he made his national television debut in a game against Booker T. Washington, throwing for two touchdowns and rushing for two more.[8] In a game where Newman beat Cohen, 76–0, Manning passed for 169 yards and five touchdowns in the first quarter of action before being pulled from the game.[9] In the first round of the Division III playoffs, Newman received a bye and played Catholic - N.I. in the second round. Manning would throw for 127 yards and a touchdown in the 14–7 win.[10] In the final game of the season in the semifinals, Manning completed less than 50 percent of his passes and threw an interception to lose to Lafayette Christian Academy, 21–7.[11] Manning was again named the starting quarterback for Newman for his junior season in 2021. In Newman's first game against Vandebilt Catholic, Manning passed for 258 yards and accounted for all four touchdowns in the 28-point shutout victory.[12] Weeks later, Manning went a perfect 11-of-11 for 179 yards and five total touchdowns in the first half of their 70–0 win over Fisher.[13] Manning had another perfect night against Cohen, going 9-of-9 for 153 yards and five passing touchdowns in the 34-point shutout win.[14] In the second round of the playoffs, Manning played Episcopal and threw for 164 yards and accounted for three touchdowns in the 37–6 win.[15] The following week, Lafayette Christian would blow out Newman, 49–7. In 2021, Manning threw for 1,841 yards, 26 touchdowns, and four interceptions while having six rushing touchdowns. Manning was the captain of the Newman football team for his senior season in 2022. In their matchup against Pearl River, Manning threw for 356 yards and seven touchdowns in a 59–7 victory, breaking his uncle Eli's Newman record of 7,268 career passing yards and his uncle Peyton's Newman record of 93 career touchdowns.[16] To avoid a media frenzy, Manning's family withheld him from media interviews and also declined premature college scholarship offers. He ran a private account on Instagram, allowing only friends and coaches to follow him, including Ole Miss head coach Lane Kiffin. \"They've shut down everything,\" said one member of the local media, \"but the attention is going to come.\"[2] In his college search he visited SMU, Clemson, LSU,[17] Alabama, Texas,[18] Georgia,[19] and Virginia,[20] as well as Ole Miss, his grandfather's, father's, and uncle's former team.[21][22] On December 21, 2022, Manning signed a letter of intent to play for the University of Texas and committed on June 23, 2022; only then did he make his account public.[23][24] After playing in the spring game for Team Orange, Manning was named the team's third-string quarterback behind Quinn Ewers and Maalik Murphy.[25] Manning made his collegiate debut on November 24, during the third quarter of a blowout win against Texas Tech, completing 2-of-5 passing attempts for 30 yards.[26] After the season, Manning was redshirted.[27] Manning made his 2024 season debut against Colorado State when he entered the game in relief of Ewers during the third quarter while the Longhorns had a 38–0 lead. Manning finished with five completions for 95 yards and a touchdown. He also added a rushing touchdown.[28] Against UTSA, Ewers left with an abdominal injury in the second quarter forcing Manning to come into the game with a 14–0 lead. On his first play of the game, Manning threw a 19-yard touchdown to DeAndre Moore. Two plays later, he rushed for a 67-yard touchdown to put the Longhorns ahead 28–7. After Manning threw a 75-yard strike to freshman wide receiver Ryan Wingo to go up 42–7, he added another passing touchdown in the fourth quarter to go up 49–7 before being relieved by freshman Trey Owens. Manning finished the game with 223 passing yards, 53 rushing yards, and five total touchdowns (four passing, one rushing) as Texas blew out UTSA, 56–7.[29][30] On September 19, head coach Steve Sarkisian announced that Manning would be the starting quarterback the following week against Louisiana–Monroe.[31] This announcement came after Manning shared the title of SEC Freshman of the Week with Texas A&M quarterback Marcel Reed for Week 3.[32] He was also named Earl Campbell Tyler Rose Award National Player of the Week and was tabbed to the Davey O'Brien Award Great 8 list.[33][34] A member of the Manning family, he is the oldest son of Cooper Manning, himself the eldest son of Archie Manning, and nephew to Cooper's NFL quarterback brothers, Peyton and Eli.[36] His younger brother, Heid, was the center for the football team and played lacrosse at Isidore Newman School.[37]",

                "content": "Editions: En/ncaa Controversy surrounds a key moment in the Texas Longhorns' victory over Ohio State, sparking debate about officiating fairness. The Texas Longhorns' star quarterback, Arch Manning, is at the center of a heated debate following a crucial play during their dramatic win against Ohio State. Fans and analysts alike are questioning whether a favorable call from the referees tipped the scales in Texas' favor during a pivotal moment late in the game. With just under two minutes left in the fourth quarter, Texas was trailing by three points and faced a critical third-and-long situation. Manning, hailed as one of college football's brightest stars, scrambled under pressure before releasing a deep pass. The play resulted in a controversial pass interference flag against Ohio State's cornerback, giving Texas a fresh set of downs and setting up their game-winning touchdown. Related: Replays show minimal contact between the defender and Texas' receiver, leading to widespread claims that the referees may have been overly generous with the call. \"It looked like clean coverage to me,\" said one former referee during a post-game analysis. \"That's a call you don't make unless it's egregious, and in this case, it wasn't.\" The Ohio State coaching staff also voiced their concerns during the post-game press conference. \"We play hard, clean football, and we expect the same standard from officiating,\" said head coach Ryan Day. \"It's disappointing to see a game of this magnitude influenced by questionable decisions.\" Despite the controversy, Manning remained poised in his post-game interviews, choosing to focus on his team's performance rather than the officiating. \"We played our hearts out and stayed resilient through all four quarters,\" Manning said. \"That's what matters most.\" The 20-year-old quarterback, who carries the weight of his family's storied football legacy, continues to shine in his freshman season. Manning has consistently delivered clutch performances, leading Texas to an impressive 9-1 record so far this year. The play has reignited discussions about the need for more consistent officiating in college football, with some calling for additional reviews for judgment calls like pass interference. Others argue that controversial moments like these are simply part of the game. As Texas prepares for its next matchup, the spotlight will remain on Arch Manning and the Longhorns. Whether the call was fair or not, Texas' dramatic win has solidified their position as serious playoff contenders this season. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved.

                "title": "Year 1 of Arch Manning - The frustrations and lessons the QB encountered at Texas - ESPN",
                "content": "NEW ORLEANS -- As soon as Arch Manning made his way toward the metal benches lining the sideline inside the Superdome for Texas media day, one cameraman gave an unintentional signal to the gathered media when he said simply, \"Let's go!\" Immediately, as soon as Manning took his seat, a group of reporters circled him, lined up three deep to hear what the true freshman had to say about his first year at Texas. The scene had Manning ask lightheartedly, \"I don't see y'all giving this attention to the other backups.\" The other backups are not named Manning. But neither are the starters, and the truth is, nobody gave that much attention to them, either. Many sat at their own podiums or tables across the football field with a smattering of reporters nearby. At one point, starting quarterback Quinn Ewers sat alone at his podium, turning behind him to see the scrum of reporters surrounding Manning. Down the sideline, co-offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach AJ Milwee turned to the other assistants near him to watch the scene unfold, hardly surprised. Manning arrived at Texas in January as not only one of the highest-rated recruits in the country but certainly the most famous one -- his name synonymous with quarterback greatness. He had done zero interviews in the year since he had made the decision to come to Texas, as the No. 2 overall prospect in the ESPN 300 in 2022. So naturally, inquiring minds had to know ... well, everything. At first, Manning looked at the assembled group with surprise, unsure whether he was allowed to answer questions. But media day for the College Football Playoff at the Allstate Sugar Bowl meant every player was available for interviews, including him. So Manning spoke for about 40 minutes and gave mostly stock answers about being the backup QB against Washington (\"I've been preparing like I'm the starter); the role his uncles Peyton and Eli have played (\"They don't overstep. Whenever I want advice, I can go to them\"); and how great it felt to be back home in New Orleans (\"It feels good to be back.\") He was guarded but friendly, following a mantra drilled into him going back to his prep days: \"My grandfather always likes to say in interviews less is best.\" But there was one brief moment when Arch let down his guard, if only for a moment, offering a small window into what this year truly has been like for him. If the outside world had great expectations for him to come in and wrest the starting job from Ewers right away, Manning knew what reality said. Ewers himself arrived at Texas in 2022 with the fanfare reserved for elite quarterback prospects, and he seemed firmly entrenched as QB1. There came lesson No. 1 in the days after enrolling in school. For the first time in his football life, Manning would have to be patient. \"There were a lot of tough days, I'm not going to lie,\" Manning said. \"I was never a backup in high school. So there are some days when you graduate early, you're alone in your dorm room, you're like, just another day of fighting for the third-string job. Some days it's tough. There's hard workouts, hard practices, they expect a lot out of you. I'm glad I went through that to help me grow.\" Milwee said he and coach Steve Sarkisian were strategic in their approach with Manning, making sure to be as honest as possible about what this season would hold for him and to remind him what he was working toward. \"I told him that this is going to be one of the tougher years that you've ever experienced as a football player because it's going to be drastically different than anything you've really ever experienced,\" Milwee said. \"You're working every day so that when that time comes for you, you're ready.\" Manning said he got some advice on staying patient from his uncle Eli, who redshirted his first season at Ole Miss in 1999 and had to wait his turn, too. \"Yeah, you need a lot of patience, especially nowadays,\" Arch Manning said. \"There's a bunch of old quarterbacks around college, so yeah, he's stressed that to me.\" Lesson No. 2 also came in his first days on campus. Manning would never just be another guy on campus no matter how hard he tried. First came the students who asked for pictures on the way to class. But that realization truly hit when Sarkisian FaceTimed him on the second day of class. Manning was sitting in his dorm room when he answered. Sarkisian had Manning's student ID card in his hand. Manning had unknowingly left it behind in English class, and the student who found it dropped it off at the football facility -- but not before taking to social media to let the whole world know Manning had already lost his ID card. Manning sheepishly admitted he lost it a second time. \"I think people that know me just know that I'm a regular guy,\" Manning said. \"I'm not some superhero. I'm just a normal 19-year-old guy just trying to work hard and play football. That's really all it is.\" Lesson No. 3 came in the preparation it would take to one day start at Texas. His teammates and coaches universally say that Manning has no ego. Offensive lineman Christian Jones recalls the first time he had a conversation with Manning, the two were getting breakfast and Manning patted him on the shoulder and told him, \"'I appreciate you coming back. That's a big thing.\" Jones said that stuck with him. \"He's that type of person.\" They also say he works just as hard as everyone else on the team. \"Oh, I know he's going to be a great quarterback. For one, He's got that Manning blood in him. And then for two, he comes in and puts the work in every day,\" said tight end Ja'Tavion Sanders. \"He's not one of those big-headed guys who thinks the world revolves around him. He's a real humble guy.\" That includes in the quarterback room, where Manning and Ewers room together on road trips. While their relationship could have started off in an awkward spot -- ballyhooed freshman looking to push the entrenched starter -- both knew and understood their roles. Manning made sure to ask Ewers a lot of questions. Ewers made sure to help Manning as much as possible. \"We're both really good buddies with each other,\" Ewers said. \"We have the same buddies around this team. You know, we hang out. The quarterbacks, during the season, we go to dinner every Tuesday. So I mean, I'm not lying about how close we really are. We're a super close group and it's rare to see that, especially nowadays in college football.\" As Manning grew as a player, he started to slowly move up the depth chart. He began the season as the scout team quarterback -- and even played Jalen Milroe in practice a few times to give the defense a good look headed into their September game against Alabama. Eventually, he started sharing second-team reps with Maalik Murphy. Finally, his time to see the field came in the regular-season finale against Texas Tech. Texas had built a 50-7 lead when Manning entered. The crowd cheered so loudly that Manning waved his arms to get the fans to pipe down. He did not want his first collegiate snap to be a pre-snap penalty. Of the crowd ovation, Manning said, \"It surprised me because I hadn't really done anything yet.\" Manning ended up leading a touchdown drive. Now comes Lesson No. 4, which is honestly a blend of all his previous learnings. Staying patient, learning how to prepare, understanding the spotlight will always be on him has led him here: back home in New Orleans, with a chance to play for a national championship. Manning enters the game as the backup quarterback behind Ewers and sums up his role this way, \"I've been preparing all year to play. I think when my name is called, I'm going to go out there and be ready to roll.\" Of course, there will be many more questions to answer when this season comes to an end. The first one has already been asked -- if Ewers decides to come back to Texas for one more season, how would Manning feel about waiting one more year to start? \"It's never fun being a backup and sitting, but each person's journey is different, and I'm going to work hard and not blink an eye and help Quinn be the best quarterback he can be and try to get better along the way,\" Manning said. \"It takes some time, but I think it'll be worth it one day.\"",

                "content": "Texas (/ˈtɛksəs/ ⓘ TEK-səss, locally also /ˈtɛksɪz/ TEK-siz;[8] Spanish: Texas or Tejas,[b] pronounced [ˈtexas]) is the most populous state in the South Central region of the United States. It borders Louisiana to the east, Arkansas to the northeast, Oklahoma to the north, New Mexico to the west, and an international border with the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas to the south and southwest. Texas has a coastline on the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast. Covering 268,596 square miles (695,660 km2), and with some 31 million residents as of 2024,[5] it is the second-largest state by both area and population. Texas is nicknamed the Lone Star State for its former status as an independent republic.[10] Spain was the first European country to claim and control Texas. Following a short-lived colony controlled by France, Mexico controlled the land until 1836 when Texas won its independence, becoming the Republic of Texas. In 1845, Texas joined the United States of America as the 28th state.[11] The state's annexation set off a chain of events that led to the Mexican–American War in 1846. Following victory by the United States, Texas remained a slave state until the American Civil War, when it declared its secession from the Union in early 1861 before officially joining the Confederate States of America on March 2. After the Civil War and the restoration of its representation in the federal government, Texas entered a long period of economic stagnation. Historically, five major industries shaped the Texas economy prior to World War II: cattle, bison, cotton, timber, and oil.[12] Before and after the Civil War, the cattle industry—which Texas came to dominate—was a major economic driver and created the traditional image of the Texas cowboy. In the later 19th century, cotton and lumber grew to be major industries as the cattle industry became less lucrative. Ultimately, the discovery of major petroleum deposits (Spindletop in particular) initiated an economic boom that became the driving force behind the economy for much of the 20th century. Texas developed a diversified economy and high tech industry during the mid-20th century. As of 2022[update], it has the most Fortune 500 company headquarters (53) in the United States.[13][14] With a growing base of industry, the state leads in many industries, including tourism, agriculture, petrochemicals, energy, computers and electronics, aerospace, and biomedical sciences. Texas has led the U.S. in state export revenue since 2002 and has the second-highest gross state product. The Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex and Greater Houston areas are the nation's fourth and fifth-most populous urban regions respectively. Its capital city is Austin. Due to its size and geologic features such as the Balcones Fault, Texas contains diverse landscapes common to both the U.S. Southern and the Southwestern regions.[15] Most population centers are in areas of former prairies, grasslands, forests, and the coastline. Traveling from east to west, terrain ranges from coastal swamps and piney woods, to rolling plains and rugged hills, to the desert and mountains of the Big Bend. The name Texas, based on the Caddo word táy:shaʼ (/tə́jːʃaʔ/) 'friend', was applied, in the spelling Tejas or Texas,[16][17][18][1] by the Spanish to the Caddo themselves, specifically the Hasinai Confederacy.[19] During Spanish colonial rule, in the 18th century, the area was known as Nuevas Filipinas ('New Philippines') and Nuevo Reino de Filipinas ('New Kingdom of the Philippines'),[20] or as provincia de los Tejas ('province of the Tejas'),[21] later also provincia de Texas (or de Tejas), ('province of Texas').[22][20] It was incorporated as provincia de Texas into the Mexican Empire in 1821, and declared a republic in 1836. The Royal Spanish Academy recognizes both spellings, Tejas and Texas, as Spanish-language forms of the name.[23] The English pronunciation with /ks/ is unetymological, contrary to the historical value of the letter x (/ʃ/) in Spanish orthography. Alternative etymologies of the name advanced in the late 19th century connected the name Texas with the Spanish word teja, meaning 'roof tile', the plural tejas being used to designate Indigenous Pueblo settlements.[24] A 1760s map by Jacques-Nicolas Bellin shows a village named Teijas on the Trinity River, close to the site of modern Crockett.[24] Texas lies between two major cultural spheres of Pre-Columbian North America: the Southwestern and the Plains areas. Archaeologists have found that three major Indigenous cultures lived in this territory, and reached their developmental peak before the first European contact. These were:[25] the Ancestral Puebloans from the upper Rio Grande region, centered west of Texas; the Mississippian culture, also known as Mound Builders, which extended along the Mississippi River Valley east of Texas; and the civilizations of Mesoamerica, which were centered south of Texas. Influence of Teotihuacan in northern Mexico peaked around AD 500 and declined between the 8th and 10th centuries. When Europeans arrived in the Texas region, the language families present in the state were Caddoan, Atakapan, Athabaskan, Coahuiltecan, and Uto-Aztecan, in addition to several language isolates such as Tonkawa. Uto-Aztecan Puebloan and Jumano peoples lived neared the Rio Grande in the western portion of the state and the Athabaskan-speaking Apache tribes lived throughout the interior. The agricultural, mound-building Caddo controlled much of the northeastern part of the state, along the Red, Sabine, and Neches River basins.[26][27] Atakapan peoples such as the Akokisa and Bidai lived along the northeastern Gulf Coast; the Karankawa lived along the central coast.[28] At least one tribe of Coahuiltecans, the Aranama, lived in southern Texas. This entire culture group, primarily centered in northeastern Mexico, is now extinct. No culture was dominant across all of present-day Texas, and many peoples inhabited the area.[29] Native American tribes who have lived inside the boundaries of present-day Texas include the Alabama, Apache, Atakapan, Bidai, Caddo, Aranama, Comanche, Choctaw, Coushatta, Hasinai, Jumano, Karankawa, Kickapoo, Kiowa, Tonkawa, and Wichita.[30][31] Many of these peoples migrated from the north or east during the colonial period, such as the Choctaw, Alabama-Coushatta, and Delaware.[26] The region was primarily controlled by the Spanish until the Texas Revolution. They were most interested in relationships with the Caddo, who were—like the Spanish—a settled, agricultural people. Several Spanish missions were opened in Caddo territory, but a lack of interest in Christianity among the Caddo meant that few were converted. Positioned between French Louisiana and Spanish Texas, the Caddo maintained relations with both, but were closer with the French.[32] After Spain took control of Louisiana, most of the missions in eastern Texas were closed and abandoned.[33] The United States obtained Louisiana following the 1803 Louisiana Purchase and began convincing tribes to self-segregate from whites by moving west; facing an overflow of native peoples in Missouri and Arkansas, they were able to negotiate with the Caddo to allow several displaced peoples to settle on unused lands in eastern Texas. These included the Muscogee, Houma Choctaw, Lenape and Mingo Seneca, among others, who came to view the Caddoans as saviors.[34][35] The temperament of Native American tribes affected the fates of European explorers and settlers in that land.[36] Friendly tribes taught newcomers how to grow local crops, prepare foods, and hunt wild game. Warlike tribes resisted the settlers.[36] Prior treaties with the Spanish forbade either side from militarizing its native population in any potential conflict between the two nations. Several outbreaks of violence between Native Americans and Texans started to spread in the prelude to the Texas Revolution. Texans accused tribes of stealing livestock. While no proof was found,[26] those in charge of Texas at the time attempted to publicly blame and punish the Caddo, with the U.S. government trying to keep them in check. The Caddo never turned to violence because of the situation, except in cases of self-defense.[34] By the 1830s, the U.S. had drafted the Indian Removal Act, which was used to facilitate the Trail of Tears. Fearing retribution, Indian Agents all over the eastern U.S. tried to convince all Indigenous peoples to uproot and move west. This included the Caddo of Louisiana and Arkansas. Following the Texas Revolution, the Texans chose to make peace with the Indigenous people, but did not honor former land claims or agreements.[citation needed] The first president of Texas, Sam Houston, aimed to cooperate and make peace with Native tribes, but his successor, Mirabeau B. Lamar, took a much more hostile stance. Hostility towards Natives by white Texans prompted the movement of most Native populations north into what would become Indian Territory (modern Oklahoma).[26][34] Only the Alabama-Coushatta would remain in the parts of Texas subject to white settlement, though the Comanche would continue to control most of the western half of the state until their defeat in the 1870s and 1880s.[37] The first historical document related to Texas was a map of the Gulf Coast, created in 1519 by Spanish explorer Alonso Álvarez de Pineda.[38] Nine years later, shipwrecked Spanish explorer Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca and his cohort became the first Europeans in what is now Texas.[39][40] Cabeza de Vaca reported that in 1528, when the Spanish landed in the area, \"half the natives died from a disease of the bowels and blamed us.\"[41] Cabeza de Vaca also made observations about the way of life of the Ignaces Natives of Texas.[c][43] Francisco Vázquez de Coronado described another encounter with native people in 1541.[d][45] The expedition of Hernando de Soto entered into Texas from the east, seeking a route to Mexico. They passed through the Caddo lands but turned back after reaching the River of Daycao (possibly the Brazos or Colorado), beyond which point the Native peoples were nomadic and did not have the agricultural stores to feed the expedition.[46][47] European powers ignored the area until accidentally settling there in 1685. Miscalculations by René-Robert Cavelier de La Salle resulted in his establishing the colony of Fort Saint Louis at Matagorda Bay rather than along the Mississippi River.[48] The colony lasted only four years before succumbing to harsh conditions and hostile natives.[49] A small band of survivors traveled eastward into the lands of the Caddo, but La Salle was killed by disgruntled expedition members.[50] In 1690 Spanish authorities, concerned that France posed a competitive threat, constructed several missions in East Texas among the Caddo.[51] After Caddo resistance, the Spanish missionaries returned to Mexico.[52] When France began settling Louisiana, in 1716 Spanish authorities responded by founding a new series of missions in East Texas.[53] Two years later, they created San Antonio as the first Spanish civilian settlement in the area.[54] Hostile native tribes and distance from nearby Spanish colonies discouraged settlers from moving to the area. It was one of New Spain's least populated provinces.[56] In 1749, the Spanish peace treaty with the Lipan Apache angered many tribes,[57] including the Comanche, Tonkawa, and Hasinai.[58] The Comanche signed a treaty with Spain in 1785 and later helped to defeat the Lipan Apache and Karankawa tribes.[59][60] With numerous missions being established, priests led a peaceful conversion of most tribes. By the end of the 18th century only a few nomadic tribes had not converted.[61] When the United States purchased Louisiana from France in 1803, American authorities insisted the agreement also included Texas. The boundary between New Spain and the United States was finally set in 1819 at the Sabine River, the modern border between Texas and Louisiana.[62] Eager for new land, many U.S. settlers refused to recognize the agreement. Several filibusters raised armies to invade the area west of the Sabine River.[63] Marked by the War of 1812, some men who had escaped from the Spanish, held (Old) Philippines had immigrated to and also passed through Texas (New Philippines)[64] and reached Louisiana where Philippine exiles aided the United States in the defense of New Orleans against a British invasion, with Filipinos in the Saint Malo settlement assisting Jean Lafitte in the Battle of New Orleans.[65] In 1821, the Mexican War of Independence included the Texas territory, which became part of Mexico.[66] Due to its low population, the territory was assigned to other states and territories of Mexico; the core territory was part of the state of Coahuila y Tejas, but other parts of today's Texas were part of Tamaulipas, Chihuahua, or the Mexican Territory of Santa Fe de Nuevo México.[67] Hoping more settlers would reduce the near-constant Comanche raids, Mexican Texas liberalized its immigration policies to permit immigrants from outside Mexico and Spain.[68] Large swathes of land were allotted to empresarios, who recruited settlers from the United States, Europe, and the Mexican interior, primarily the U.S. Austin's settlers, the Old Three Hundred, made places along the Brazos River in 1822.[69] The population of Texas grew rapidly. In 1825, Texas had about 3,500 people, with most of Mexican descent.[70] By 1834, the population had grown to about 37,800 people, with only 7,800 of Mexican descent.[71] Many immigrants openly flouted Mexican law, especially the prohibition against slavery. Combined with United States' attempts to purchase Texas, Mexican authorities decided in 1830 to prohibit continued immigration from the United States.[72] However, illegal immigration from the United States into Mexico continued to increase the population of Texas.[73] New laws also called for the enforcement of customs duties angering native Mexican citizens (Tejanos) and recent immigrants alike.[74] The Anahuac Disturbances in 1832 were the first open revolt against Mexican rule, coinciding with a revolt in Mexico against the nation's president.[75] Texians sided with the federalists against the government and drove all Mexican soldiers out of East Texas.[76] They took advantage of the lack of oversight to agitate for more political freedom. Texians met at the Convention of 1832 to discuss requesting independent statehood, among other issues.[77] The following year, Texians reiterated their demands at the Convention of 1833.[78] Within Mexico, tensions continued between federalists and centralists. In early 1835, wary Texians formed Committees of Correspondence and Safety.[79] The unrest erupted into armed conflict in late 1835 at the Battle of Gonzales.[80] This launched the Texas Revolution. Texians elected delegates to the Consultation, which created a provisional government.[81] The provisional government soon collapsed from infighting, and Texas was without clear governance for the first two months of 1836.[82] Mexican President Antonio López de Santa Anna personally led an army to end the revolt.[83] General José de Urrea defeated all the Texian resistance along the coast culminating in the Goliad massacre.[84] López de Santa Anna's forces, after a thirteen-day siege, overwhelmed Texian defenders at the Battle of the Alamo. News of the defeats sparked panic among Texas settlers.[85] The newly elected Texian delegates to the Convention of 1836 quickly signed a declaration of independence on March 2, forming the Republic of Texas. After electing interim officers, the Convention disbanded.[86] The new government joined the other settlers in Texas in the Runaway Scrape, fleeing from the approaching Mexican army.[85] After several weeks of retreat, the Texian Army commanded by Sam Houston attacked and defeated López de Santa Anna's forces at the Battle of San Jacinto.[87] López de Santa Anna was captured and forced to sign the Treaties of Velasco, ending the war.[88] The Constitution of the Republic of Texas prohibited the government from restricting slavery or freeing slaves, and required free people of African descent to leave the country.[89] Political battles raged between two factions of the new Republic. The nationalist faction, led by Mirabeau B. Lamar, advocated the continued independence of Texas, the expulsion of the Native Americans, and the expansion of the Republic to the Pacific Ocean. Their opponents, led by Sam Houston, advocated the annexation of Texas to the United States and peaceful co-existence with Native Americans. The conflict between the factions was typified by an incident known as the Texas Archive War.[90] With wide popular support, Texas first applied for annexation to the United States in 1836, but its status as a slaveholding country caused its admission to be controversial and it was initially rebuffed. This status, and Mexican diplomacy in support of its claims to the territory, also complicated Texas's ability to form foreign alliances and trade relationships.[91] The Comanche Indians furnished the main Native American opposition to the Texas Republic, manifested in multiple raids on settlements.[92] Mexico launched two small expeditions into Texas in 1842. The town of San Antonio was captured twice and Texans were defeated in battle in the Dawson massacre. Despite these successes, Mexico did not keep an occupying force in Texas, and the republic survived.[93] The cotton price crash of the 1840s depressed the country's economy.[91] Texas was finally annexed when the expansionist James K. Polk won the election of 1844.[94] On December 29, 1845, the U.S. Congress admitted Texas to the U.S.[95] After Texas's annexation, Mexico broke diplomatic relations with the United States. While the United States claimed Texas's border stretched to the Rio Grande, Mexico claimed it was the Nueces River leaving the Rio Grande Valley under contested Texan sovereignty.[95] While the former Republic of Texas could not enforce its border claims, the United States had the military strength and the political will to do so. President Polk ordered General Zachary Taylor south to the Rio Grande on January 13, 1846. A few months later Mexican troops routed an American cavalry patrol in the disputed area in the Thornton Affair starting the Mexican–American War. The first battles of the war were fought in Texas: the Siege of Fort Texas, Battle of Palo Alto and Battle of Resaca de la Palma. After these decisive victories, the United States invaded Mexican territory, ending the fighting in Texas.[96] The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the two-year war. In return for US$18,250,000, Mexico gave the U.S. undisputed control of Texas, ceded the Mexican Cession in 1848, most of which today is called the American Southwest, and Texas's borders were established at the Rio Grande.[96] The Compromise of 1850 set Texas's boundaries at their present position: Texas ceded its claims to land which later became half of present-day New Mexico,[97] a third of Colorado, and small portions of Kansas, Oklahoma, and Wyoming to the federal government, in return for the assumption of $10 million of the old republic's debt.[97] Post-war Texas grew rapidly as migrants poured into the cotton lands of the state.[98] They also brought or purchased enslaved African Americans, whose numbers tripled in the state from 1850 to 1860, from 58,000 to 182,566.[99] Texas re-entered war following the election of 1860. During this time, Black people comprised 30 percent of the state's population, and they were overwhelmingly enslaved.[100] When Abraham Lincoln was elected, South Carolina seceded from the Union; five other Deep South states quickly followed. A state convention considering secession opened in Austin on January 28, 1861. On February 1, by a vote of 166–8, the convention adopted an Ordinance of Secession. Texas voters approved this Ordinance on February 23, 1861. Texas joined the newly created Confederate States of America on March 4, 1861, ratifying the permanent C.S. Constitution on March 23.[1][101] Not all Texans favored secession initially, although many of the same would later support the Southern cause. Texas's most notable Unionist was the state governor, Sam Houston. Not wanting to aggravate the situation, Houston refused two offers from President Lincoln for Union troops to keep him in office. After refusing to swear an oath of allegiance to the Confederacy, Houston was deposed.[102] While far from the major battlefields of the American Civil War, Texas contributed large numbers of soldiers and equipment.[103] Union troops briefly occupied the state's primary port, Galveston. Texas's border with Mexico was known as the \"backdoor of the Confederacy\" because trade occurred at the border, bypassing the Union blockade.[104] The Confederacy repulsed all Union attempts to shut down this route,[103] but Texas's role as a supply state was marginalized in mid-1863 after the Union capture of the Mississippi River. The final battle of the Civil War was fought at Palmito Ranch, near Brownsville, Texas, and saw a Confederate victory.[105][106] Texas descended into anarchy for two months between the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia and the assumption of authority by Union General Gordon Granger. Violence marked the early months of Reconstruction.[103] Juneteenth commemorates the announcement of the Emancipation Proclamation in Galveston by General Gordon Granger, almost two and a half years after the original announcement.[107][108] President Johnson, in 1866, declared the civilian government restored in Texas.[109] Despite not meeting Reconstruction requirements, Congress resumed allowing elected Texas representatives into the federal government in 1870. Social volatility continued as the state struggled with agricultural depression and labor issues.[110] Like most of the South, the Texas economy was devastated by the War. However, since the state had not been as dependent on slaves as other parts of the South, it was able to recover more quickly. The culture in Texas during the later 19th century exhibited many facets of a frontier territory. The state became notorious as a haven for people from other parts of the country who wanted to escape debt, war tensions, or other problems. \"Gone to Texas\" was a common expression for those fleeing the law in other states. Nevertheless, the state also attracted many businessmen and other settlers with more legitimate interests.[111] The cattle industry continued to thrive, though it gradually became less profitable. Cotton and lumber became major industries creating new economic booms in various regions. Railroad networks grew rapidly as did the port at Galveston as commerce expanded. The lumber industry quickly expanded and was Texas' largest industry prior to the 20th century.[112] In 1900, Texas suffered the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history during the Galveston hurricane.[113] On January 10, 1901, the first major oil well in Texas, Spindletop, was found south of Beaumont. Other fields were later discovered nearby in East Texas, West Texas, and under the Gulf of Mexico. The resulting \"oil boom\" transformed Texas.[114] Oil production averaged three million barrels per day at its peak in 1972.[115] In 1901, the Democratic-dominated state legislature passed a bill requiring payment of a poll tax for voting, which effectively disenfranchised most Black and many poor White and Latino people. In addition, the legislature established white primaries, ensuring minorities were excluded from the formal political process. The number of voters dropped dramatically, and the Democrats crushed competition from the Republican and Populist parties.[116][117] The Socialist Party became the second-largest party in Texas after 1912,[118] coinciding with a large socialist upsurge in the United States during fierce battles in the labor movement and the popularity of national heroes like Eugene V. Debs. The socialists' popularity soon waned after their vilification by the federal government for their opposition to U.S. involvement in World War I.[119][120] The Great Depression and the Dust Bowl dealt a double blow to the state's economy, which had significantly improved since the Civil War. Migrants abandoned the worst-hit sections of Texas during the Dust Bowl years. Especially from this period on, Black people left Texas in the Great Migration to get work in the Northern United States or California and to escape segregation.[100] In 1940, Texas was 74% White, 14.4% Black, and 11.5% Hispanic.[121] World War II had a dramatic impact on Texas, as federal money poured in to build military bases, munitions factories, detention camps and Army hospitals; 750,000 Texans left for service; the cities exploded with new industry; and hundreds of thousands of poor farmers left the fields for much better-paying war jobs, never to return to agriculture.[122][123] Texas manufactured 3.1 percent of total United States military armaments produced during World War II, ranking eleventh among the 48 states.[124] Texas modernized and expanded its system of higher education through the 1960s. The state created a comprehensive plan for higher education, funded in large part by oil revenues, and a central state apparatus designed to manage state institutions more efficiently. These changes helped Texas universities receive federal research funds.[125] Beginning around the mid-20th century, Texas began to transform from a rural and agricultural state to one urban and industrialized.[126] The state's population grew quickly during this period, with large levels of migration from outside the state.[126] As a part of the Sun Belt, Texas experienced strong economic growth, particularly during the 1970s and early 1980s.[126] Texas's economy diversified, lessening its reliance on the petroleum industry.[126] By 1990, Hispanics and Latino Americans overtook Blacks to become the largest minority group.[126] Texas has the largest Black population with over 3.9 million.[127] During the late 20th century, the Republican Party replaced the Democratic Party as the dominant party in the state.[126] Beginning in the early 21st century, metropolitan areas including Dallas–Fort Worth and Greater Austin became centers for the Texas Democratic Party in statewide and national elections as liberal policies became more accepted in urban areas.[128][129][130][131] From the mid-2000s to 2019, Texas gained an influx of business relocations and regional headquarters from companies in California.[132][133][134][135] Texas became a major destination for migration during the early 21st century and was named the most popular state to move for three consecutive years.[136] Another study in 2019 determined Texas's growth rate at 1,000 people per day.[137] During the COVID-19 pandemic in Texas, the first confirmed case of the virus in Texas was announced on March 4, 2020.[138] On April 27, 2020, Governor Greg Abbott announced phase one of re-opening the economy.[139] Amid a rise in COVID-19 cases in autumn 2020, Abbott refused to enact further lockdowns.[140][141] In November 2020, Texas was selected as one of four states to test Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine distribution.[142] As of February 2, 2021, there had been over 2.4 million confirmed cases in Texas, with at least 37,417 deaths.[143] During February 13–17, 2021, the state faced a major weather emergency as Winter Storm Uri hit the state, as well as most of the Southeastern and Midwestern United States.[144][145] Historically high power usage across the state caused the state's power grid to become overworked and ERCOT (the main operator of the Texas Interconnection grid) declared an emergency and began to implement rolling blackouts across Texas, causing a power crisis.[146][147][148] Over 3 million Texans were without power and over 4 million were under boil-water notices.[149] Texas is the second-largest U.S. state by area, after Alaska, and the largest state within the contiguous United States, at 268,820 square miles (696,200 km2). If it were an independent country, Texas would be the 39th-largest.[150] It ranks 26th worldwide amongst country subdivisions by size. Texas is in the south central part of the United States. The Rio Grande forms a natural border with the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas to the south. The Red River forms a natural border with Oklahoma and Arkansas to the north. The Sabine River forms a natural border with Louisiana to the east. The Texas Panhandle has an eastern border with Oklahoma at 100° W, a northern border with Oklahoma at 36°30' N and a western border with New Mexico at 103° W. El Paso lies on the state's western tip at 32° N and the Rio Grande.[97] With 10 climatic regions, 14 soil regions and 11 distinct ecological regions, regional classification becomes complicated with differences in soils, topography, geology, rainfall, and plant and animal communities.[151] One classification system divides Texas, in order from southeast to west, into the following: Gulf Coastal Plains, Interior Lowlands, Great Plains, and Basin and Range Province.[152] The Gulf Coastal Plains region wraps around the Gulf of Mexico on the southeast section of the state. Vegetation in this region consists of thick piney woods. The Interior Lowlands region consists of gently rolling to hilly forested land and is part of a larger pine-hardwood forest. The Cross Timbers region and Caprock Escarpment are part of the Interior Lowlands.[152] The Great Plains region in Central Texas spans through the state's panhandle and Llano Estacado to the state's hill country near Lago Vista and Austin. This region is dominated by prairie and steppe. \"Far West Texas\" or the \"Trans-Pecos\" region is the state's Basin and Range Province. The most varied of the regions, this area includes Sand Hills, the Stockton Plateau, desert valleys, wooded mountain slopes and desert grasslands.[153] Texas has 3,700 named streams and 15 major rivers,[154][155] with the Rio Grande as the largest. Other major rivers include the Pecos, the Brazos, Colorado, and Red River. While Texas has few natural lakes, Texans have built more than a hundred artificial reservoirs.[156] The size and unique history of Texas make its regional affiliation debatable; it can be considered a Southern or a Southwestern state, or both. The vast geographic, economic, and cultural diversity within the state itself prohibits easy categorization of the whole state into a recognized region of the United States. Notable extremes range from East Texas which is often considered an extension of the Deep South, to Far West Texas which is generally acknowledged to be part of the interior Southwest.[157] Texas is the southernmost part of the Great Plains, which ends in the south against the folded Sierra Madre Occidental of Mexico. The continental crust forms a stable Mesoproterozoic craton which changes across a broad continental margin and transitional crust into true oceanic crust of the Gulf of Mexico. The oldest rocks in Texas date from the Mesoproterozoic and are about 1,600 million years old.[158] This margin existed until Laurasia and Gondwana collided in the Pennsylvanian subperiod to form Pangea.[159] Pangea began to break up in the Triassic, but seafloor spreading to form the Gulf of Mexico occurred only in the mid- and late Jurassic. The shoreline shifted again to the eastern margin of the state and the Gulf of Mexico's passive margin began to form. Today 9 to 12 miles (14 to 19 km) of sediments are buried beneath the Texas continental shelf and a large proportion of remaining US oil reserves are here. The incipient Gulf of Mexico basin was restricted and seawater often evaporated completely to form thick evaporite deposits of Jurassic age. These salt deposits formed salt dome diapirs, and are found in East Texas along the Gulf coast.[160] East Texas outcrops consist of Cretaceous and Paleogene sediments which contain important deposits of Eocene lignite. The Mississippian and Pennsylvanian sediments in the north; Permian sediments in the west; and Cretaceous sediments in the east, along the Gulf coast and out on the Texas continental shelf contain oil. Oligocene volcanic rocks are found in far west Texas in the Big Bend area. A blanket of Miocene sediments known as the Ogallala formation in the western high plains region is an important aquifer.[161] Located far from an active plate tectonic boundary, Texas has no volcanoes and few earthquakes.[162] Texas is the home to 65 species of mammals, 213 species of reptiles and amphibians, including the American green tree frog, and the greatest diversity of bird life in the United States—590 native species in all.[163] At least 12 species have been introduced and now reproduce freely in Texas.[164] Texas plays host to several species of wasps, including an abundance of Polistes exclamans,[165] and is an important ground for the study of Polistes annularis.[166] During the spring Texas wildflowers such as the state flower, the bluebonnet, line highways throughout Texas. During the Johnson Administration the first lady, Lady Bird Johnson, worked to draw attention to Texas wildflowers.[167] The large size of Texas and its location at the intersection of multiple climate zones gives the state highly variable weather. The Panhandle of the state has colder winters than North Texas, while the Gulf Coast has mild winters. Texas has wide variations in precipitation patterns. El Paso, on the western end of the state, averages 8.7 inches (220 mm) of annual rainfall,[168] while parts of southeast Texas average as much as 64 inches (1,600 mm) per year.[169] Dallas in the North Central region averages a more moderate 37 inches (940 mm) per year.[170] Snow falls multiple times each winter in the Panhandle and mountainous areas of West Texas, once or twice a year in North Texas, and once every few years in Central and East Texas. Snow falls south of San Antonio or on the coast only in rare circumstances. Of note is the 2004 Christmas Eve snowstorm, when 6 inches (150 mm) of snow fell as far south as Kingsville, where the average high temperature in December is 65 °F.[171] Night-time summer temperatures range from the upper 50s °F (14 °C) in the West Texas mountains to 80 °F (27 °C) in Galveston.[172][173] The table below consists of averages for August (generally the warmest month) and January (generally the coldest) in selected cities in various regions of the state. Thunderstorms strike Texas often, especially the eastern and northern portions of the state. Tornado Alley covers the northern section of Texas. The state experiences the most tornadoes in the United States, an average of 139 a year. These strike most frequently in North Texas and the Panhandle.[175] Tornadoes in Texas generally occur in April, May, and June.[176] Some of the most destructive hurricanes in U.S. history have impacted Texas. A hurricane in 1875 killed about 400 people in Indianola, followed by another hurricane in 1886 that destroyed the town. These events allowed Galveston to take over as the chief port city. The 1900 Galveston hurricane subsequently devastated that city, killing about 8,000 people or possibly as many as 12,000 in the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history.[113] In 2017, Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Rockport as a Category 4 Hurricane, causing significant damage there. Its unprecedented amounts of rain over the Greater Houston area resulted in widespread and catastrophic flooding that inundated hundreds of thousands of homes. Harvey ultimately became the costliest hurricane worldwide, causing an estimated $198.6 billion in damage, surpassing the cost of Hurricane Katrina.[177] Other devastating Texas hurricanes include the 1915 Galveston hurricane, Hurricane Audrey in 1957, Hurricane Carla in 1961, Hurricane Beulah in 1967, Hurricane Alicia in 1983, Hurricane Rita in 2005, and Hurricane Ike in 2008. Tropical storms have also caused their share of damage: Allison in 1989 and again during 2001, Claudette in 1979, and Tropical Storm Imelda in 2019.[178][179][180] There is no substantial physical barrier between Texas and the polar region. Although it is unusual, it is possible for arctic or polar air masses to penetrate Texas,[181][182] as occurred during the February 13–17, 2021 North American winter storm.[183][184] Usually, prevailing winds in North America will push polar air masses to the southeast before they reach Texas. Because such intrusions are rare, and, perhaps, unexpected, they may result in crises such as the 2021 Texas power crisis. As of 2017[update], Texas emitted the most greenhouse gases in the U.S.[185] As of 2017[update] the state emits about 1,600 billion pounds (707 million metric tons) of carbon dioxide annually.[185] As an independent state, Texas would rank as the world's seventh-largest producer of greenhouse gases.[186] Causes of the state's vast greenhouse gas emissions include the state's large number of coal power plants and the state's refining and manufacturing industries.[186] In 2010, there were 2,553 \"emission events\" which poured 44.6 million pounds (20,200 metric tons) of contaminants into the Texas sky.[187] The state has three cities with populations exceeding one million: Houston, San Antonio, and Dallas.[192] These three rank among the 10 most populous cities of the United States. As of 2020, six Texas cities had populations greater than 600,000. Austin, Fort Worth, and El Paso are among the 20 largest U.S. cities. Texas has four metropolitan areas with populations greater than a million: Dallas–Fort Worth–Arlington, Houston–Sugar Land–The Woodlands, San Antonio–New Braunfels, and Austin–Round Rock–San Marcos. The Dallas–Fort Worth and Houston metropolitan areas number about 7.5 million and 7 million residents as of 2019, respectively.[193] Three interstate highways—I-35 to the west (Dallas–Fort Worth to San Antonio, with Austin in between), I-45 to the east (Dallas to Houston), and I-10 to the south (San Antonio to Houston) define the Texas Urban Triangle region. The region of 60,000 square miles (160,000 km2) contains most of the state's largest cities and metropolitan areas as well as 17 million people, nearly 75 percent of Texas's total population.[194] Houston and Dallas have been recognized as world cities.[195] These cities are spread out amongst the state.[196] In contrast to the cities, unincorporated rural settlements known as colonias often lack basic infrastructure and are marked by poverty.[197] The office of the Texas Attorney General stated, in 2011, that Texas had about 2,294 colonias, and estimates about 500,000 lived in the colonias. Hidalgo County, as of 2011, has the largest number of colonias.[198] Texas has the largest number of people living in colonias of all states.[197] Texas has 254 counties, more than any other state.[199] Each county runs on Commissioners' Court system consisting of four elected commissioners (one from each of four precincts in the county, roughly divided according to population) and a county judge elected at large from the entire county. County government runs similar to a \"weak\" mayor-council system; the county judge has no veto authority, but votes along with the other commissioners.[200][201] Although Texas permits cities and counties to enter \"interlocal agreements\" to share services, the state does not allow consolidated city-county governments, nor does it have metropolitan governments. Counties are not granted home rule status; their powers are strictly defined by state law. The state does not have townships—areas within a county are either incorporated or unincorporated. Incorporated areas are part of a municipality. The county provides limited services to unincorporated areas and to some smaller incorporated areas. Municipalities are classified either \"general law\" cities or \"home rule\".[202] A municipality may elect home rule status once it exceeds 5,000 population with voter approval.[203] Texas also permits the creation of \"special districts\", which provide limited services. The most common is the school district, but can also include hospital districts, community college districts, and utility districts. Municipal, school district, and special district elections are nonpartisan,[204] though the party affiliation of a candidate may be well-known. County and state elections are partisan.[205] The resident population of Texas was 29,145,505 in the 2020 census, a 15.9% increase since the 2010 census.[207] At the 2020 census, the apportioned population of Texas stood at 29,183,290.[208] The U.S. Census Bureau estimated the population was 31,290,831 as of July 1, 2024, an increase of 7.4% since the 2020 census.[5] Texas is the second-most populous state in the United States after California and the only other U.S. state to surpass a total estimated population of 30 million people as of July 2, 2022.[209][210] In 2015, Texas had 4.7 million foreign-born residents, about 17% of the population and 21.6% of the state workforce.[211] The major countries of origin for Texan immigrants were Mexico (55.1% of immigrants), India (5%), El Salvador (4.3%), Vietnam (3.7%), and China (2.3%).[211] Of immigrant residents, 35.8 percent were naturalized U.S. citizens.[211] As of 2018, the population increased to 4.9 million foreign-born residents or 17.2% of the state population, up from 2,899,642 in 2000.[212] In 2014, there were an estimated 1.7 million undocumented immigrants in Texas, making up 35% of the total Texas immigrant population and 6.1% of the total state population.[211] In addition to the state's foreign-born population, an additional 4.1 million Texans (15% of the state's population) were born in the United States and had at least one immigrant parent.[211] According to the American Community Survey's 2019 estimates, 1,739,000 residents were undocumented immigrants, a decrease of 103,000 since 2014 and increase of 142,000 since 2016. Of the undocumented immigrant population, 951,000 have resided in Texas from less than 5 up to 14 years. An estimated 788,000 lived in Texas from 15 to 19 and 20 years or more.[213] Texas's Rio Grande Valley has seen significant migration from across the U.S.–Mexico border. During the 2014 crisis, many Central Americans, including unaccompanied minors traveling alone from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, reached the state, overwhelming Border Patrol resources for a time. Many sought asylum in the United States.[214][215] Texas's population density as of 2010 is 96.3 people per square mile (37.2 people/km2) which is slightly higher than the average population density of the U.S. as a whole, at 87.4 people per square mile (33.7 people/km2). In contrast, while Texas and France are similarly sized geographically, the European country has a population density of 301.8 people per square mile (116.5 people/km2). Two-thirds of all Texans live in major metropolitan areas such as Houston. According to HUD's 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 24,432 homeless people in Texas.[216][217] In 2019, non-Hispanic Whites represented 41.2% of Texas's population, reflecting a national demographic shift.[219][220][221] Black people made up 12.9%, American Indians and Alaska Natives 1.0%, Asian Americans 5.2%, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders 0.1%, some other race 0.2%, and two or more races 1.8%. Hispanics or Latino Americans of any race made up 39.7% of the estimated population.[222] At the 2020 census, the racial and ethnic composition of the state was 42.5% White (39.8% non-Hispanic White), 11.8% Black, 5.4% Asian, 0.3% American Indian and Alaska Native, 0.1% Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, 13.6% some other race, 17.6% two or more races, and 40.2% Hispanic and Latino American of any race.[223][224] In 2010, 49% of all births were Hispanics; 35% were non-Hispanic White; 11.5% were non-Hispanic Black, and 4.3% were Asians/Pacific Islanders.[225] Based on U.S. Census Bureau data released in February 2011, for the first time in recent history, Texas's White population is below 50% (45%) and Hispanics grew to 38%. Between 2000 and 2010, the total population grew by 20.6%, but Hispanics and Latino Americans grew by 65%, whereas non-Hispanic Whites grew by only 4.2%.[226] Texas has the fifth highest rate of teenage births in the nation and a plurality of these are to Hispanics or Latinos.[227][228] As of 2022, Hispanics and Latinos of any race replaced the non-Hispanic White population as the largest share of the state's population.[229] Texas has the second-largest share of Mexican Americans in the US, making up 32.2% of the total population and 80% of the state's Hispanic population.[230] Other than Mexican, the largest self-reported ancestries in the state as of 2022 were German (8.1%), English (7.9%), Irish (5.8%), those identifying as American (4.6%), Italian (1.9%), Indian (1.9%), Salvadoran (1.4%), Scottish (1.3%), Vietnamese (1.1%), Chinese (1%), Puerto Rican (0.9%), Polish (0.9%), Honduran (0.8%), Filipino (0.8%), and Scotch-Irish (0.7%).[231][232][230] The most common accent or dialect spoken by natives throughout Texas is sometimes referred to as Texan English, itself a sub-variety of a broader category of American English known as Southern American English.[234][235] Creole language is spoken in some parts of East Texas.[236] In some areas of the state—particularly in the large cities—Western American English and General American English, is increasingly common. Chicano English—due to a growing Hispanic population—is widespread in South Texas, while African-American English is especially notable in historically minority areas of urban Texas. At the 2020 American Community Survey's estimates, 64.9% of the population spoke only English, while 35.1% spoke a language other than English.[237] Roughly 30% of the total population spoke Spanish. By 2021, approximately 50,546 Texans spoke French or a French-based creole language. German and other West Germanic languages were spoken by 49,565 residents; Russian, Polish, and other Slavic languages by 37,444; Korean by 31,673; Chinese 86,370; Vietnamese 92,410; Tagalog 40,124; and Arabic by 47,170 Texans.[238] At the census of 2010, 65.8% (14,740,304) of Texas residents age 5 and older spoke only English at home, while 29.2% (6,543,702) spoke Spanish, 0.8 percent (168,886) Vietnamese, and Chinese (which includes Cantonese and Mandarin) was spoken by 0.6% (122,921) of the population over five.[233] Other languages spoken include German (including Texas German) by 0.3% (73,137), Tagalog with 0.3% (64,272) speakers, and French (including Cajun French) was spoken by 0.3% (55,773) of Texans.[233] Reportedly, Cherokee is the most widely spoken Native American language in Texas.[239] In total, 34.2% (7,660,406) of Texas's population aged five and older spoke a language at home other than English as of 2006.[233] With the coming of Spanish Catholic and American Protestant missionary societies,[241] Indigenous American Indian religions and spiritual traditions dwindled. Since then, colonial and present-day Texas has become a predominantly Christian state, with 75.5% of the population identifying as such according to the Public Religion Research Institute in 2020.[242] Among its majority Christian populace, the largest Christian denomination as of 2014 has been the Catholic Church, per the Pew Research Center at 23% of the population, although Protestants collectively constituted 50% of the Christian population in 2014;[243] in the 2020 study by the Public Religion Research Institute, the Catholic Church's membership increased to encompassing 28% of the population identifying with a religious or spiritual belief.[242] At the 2020 Association of Religion Data Archives study, there were 5,905,142 Catholics in the state.[244] The largest Catholic jurisdictions in Texas are the Archdiocese of Galveston–Houston—the first and oldest Latin Church diocese in Texas[245]—the dioceses of Dallas and Fort Worth, and the Archdiocese of San Antonio. Being part of the strongly, socially conservative Bible Belt,[246] Protestants as a whole declined to 47% of the population in the 2020 study by the Public Religion Research Institute. Predominantly-white Evangelical Protestantism declined to 14% of the Protestant Christian population. Mainline Protestants in contrast made up 15% of Protestant Texas. Hispanic or Latino American-dominated Protestant churches and historically Black or African American Protestantism grew to a collective 13% of the Protestant population. Evangelical Protestants were 31% of the population in 2014, and Baptists were the largest Evangelical tradition (14%);[243] according to the 2014 study, they made up the second-largest Mainline Protestant group behind Methodists (4%). Nondenominational and interdenominational Protestant Christians were the second largest Evangelical group (7%) followed by Pentecostals (4%). The largest Evangelical Baptists in the state were the Southern Baptist Convention (9%) and independent Baptists (3%). The Assemblies of God USA was the largest Evangelical Pentecostal denomination in 2014. Among Mainline Protestants, the United Methodist Church was the largest denomination (4%) and the American Baptist Churches USA comprised the second-largest Mainline Protestant group (2%). According to the Pew Research Center in 2014, the state's largest historically African American Christian denominations were the National Baptist Convention (USA) and the Church of God in Christ. Black Methodists and other Christians made up less than 1 percent each of the Christian demographic. Other Christians made up 1 percent of the total Christian population, and the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox formed less than 1 percent of the statewide Christian populace. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the largest nontrinitarian Christian group in Texas alongside the Jehovah's Witnesses.[243] Among its Protestant population, the Association of Religion Data Archives in 2020 determined Southern Baptists numbered 3,319,962; non-denominational Protestants 2,405,786 (including Christian Churches and Churches of Christ, and the Churches of Christ altogether numbering 2,758,353); and United Methodists 938,399 as the most numerous Protestant groups in the state.[244] Baptists altogether (Southern Baptists, American Baptist Associates, American Baptists, Full Gospel Baptists, General Baptists, Free Will Baptists, National Baptists, National Baptists of America, National Missionary Baptists, National Primitive Baptists, and Progressive National Baptists) numbered 3,837,306; Methodists within United Methodism, the AME, AME Zion, CME, and the Free Methodist Church numbered 1,026,453 Texans. The same study tabulated 425,038 Pentecostals spread among the Assemblies of God, Church of God (Cleveland), and Church of God in Christ. Nontrinitarian or Oneness Pentecostals numbered 7,042 between Bible Way Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ, COOLJC, and the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World. Other Christians, including the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox, numbered 55,329 altogether, and Episcopalians numbered 134,318, although the Anglican Catholic Church, Anglican Church in America, Anglican Church in North America, Anglican Province of America, and Holy Catholic Church Anglican Rite had a collective presence in 114 churches.[247] Non-Christian faiths accounted for 4% of the religious population in 2014, and 5% in 2020 per the Pew Research Center and Public Religion Research Institute.[243][242] Adherents of many other religions reside predominantly in the urban centers of Texas. Judaism, Islam, and Buddhism were tied as the second largest religion as of 2014 and 2020. In 2014, 18% of the state's population were religiously unaffiliated. Of the unaffiliated in 2014, an estimated 2% were atheists and 3% agnostic; in 2020, the Public Religion Research Institute noted the largest non-Christian groups were the irreligious (20%), Judaism (1%), Islam (1%), Buddhism (1%) and Hinduism, and other religions at less than 1 percent each. In 1990, the Islamic population was about 140,000 with more recent figures putting the current number of Muslims between 350,000 and 400,000 as of 2012.[248] The Association of Religion Data Archives estimated there were 313,209 Muslims as of 2020.[244] Texas is the fifth-largest Muslim-populated state as of 2014.[249] The Jewish population was around 128,000 in 2008.[250] In 2020, the Jewish population grew to over 176,000.[251] According to ARDA's 2020 study, there were 43 Chabad synagogues; 17,513 Conservative Jews; 8,110 Orthodox Jews; and 31,378 Reform Jews. Around 146,000 adherents of religions such as Hinduism and Sikhism lived in Texas as of 2004.[252] By 2020, there were 112,153 Hindus and 20 Sikh gurdwaras; 60,882 Texans adhered to Buddhism. As of 2024, Texas had a gross state product (GSP) of $2.664 trillion, the second highest in the U.S.[253] Its GSP is greater than the GDP of Brazil, the world's 8th-largest economy.[254] The state ranks 22nd among U.S. states with a median household income of $64,034, while the poverty rate is 14.2%, making Texas the state with 14th highest poverty rate (compared to 13.15% nationally). Texas's economy is the second-largest of any country subdivision globally, behind California. Texas's large population, an abundance of natural resources, thriving cities and leading centers of higher education have contributed to a large and diverse economy. Since oil was discovered, the state's economy has reflected the state of the petroleum industry. In recent times, urban centers of the state have increased in size, containing two-thirds of the population in 2005. The state's economic growth has led to urban sprawl and its associated symptoms.[255] As of May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the state's unemployment rate was 13 percent.[256] In 2010, Site Selection Magazine ranked Texas as the most business-friendly state, in part because of the state's three-billion-dollar Texas Enterprise Fund.[257] Texas has the highest number of Fortune 500 company headquarters in the United States as of 2022.[13][14] In 2010, there were 346,000 millionaires in Texas, the second-largest population of millionaires in the nation.[f][258] In 2018, the number of millionaire households increased to 566,578.[259] Texas has a reputation for a low tax.[260] According to the Tax Foundation, Texans' state and local tax burdens are seventh-lowest nationally; state and local taxes cost $3,580 per capita, or 8.4 percent of resident incomes.[261] Texas is one of seven states that lack a state income tax.[261][262] Instead, the state collects revenue from property taxes (though these are collected at the county, city, and school district level; Texas has a state constitutional prohibition against a state property tax) and sales taxes. The state sales tax rate is 6.25 percent,[261][263] but local taxing jurisdictions (cities, counties, special purpose districts, and transit authorities) may also impose sales and use tax up to 2 percent for a total maximum combined rate of 8.25 percent.[264] Texas is a \"tax donor state\"; in 2005, for every dollar Texans paid to the federal government in federal income taxes, the state got back about $0.94 in benefits.[261] To attract business, Texas has incentive programs worth $19 billion per year (2012); more than any other U.S. state.[265][266] Texas has the most farms and the highest acreage in the United States. The state is ranked No. 1 for revenue generated from total livestock and livestock products. It is ranked No. 2 for total agricultural revenue, behind California.[267] At $7.4 billion or 56.7 percent of Texas's annual agricultural cash receipts, beef cattle production represents the largest single segment of Texas agriculture. This is followed by cotton at $1.9 billion (14.6 percent), greenhouse/nursery at $1.5 billion (11.4 percent), broiler chickens at $1.3 billion (10 percent), and dairy products at $947 million (7.3 percent).[268] Texas leads the nation in the production of cattle, horses, sheep, goats, wool, mohair and hay.[268] The state also leads the nation in production of cotton which is the number one crop grown in the state in terms of value.[267][269][270] The state grows significant amounts of cereal crops and produce.[267] Texas has a large commercial fishing industry. With mineral resources, Texas leads in creating cement, crushed stone, lime, salt, sand and gravel.[267] Texas throughout the 21st century has been hammered by drought, costing the state billions of dollars in livestock and crops.[271] Ever since the discovery of oil at Spindletop, energy has been a dominant force politically and economically within the state.[272] If Texas were its own country it would be the sixth-largest oil producer in the world according to a 2014 study.[273] The Railroad Commission of Texas regulates the state's oil and gas industry, gas utilities, pipeline safety, safety in the liquefied petroleum gas industry, and surface coal and uranium mining. Until the 1970s, the commission controlled the price of petroleum because of its ability to regulate Texas's oil reserves. The founders of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) used the Texas agency as one of their models for petroleum price control.[274] As of January 1, 2021, Texas has proved recoverable petroleum reserves of about 15.6 billion barrels (2.48×109 m3) of crude oil (44% of the known U.S. reserves) and 9.5 billion barrels (1.51×109 m3) of natural gas liquids.[275][276] The state's refineries can process 5.95 million barrels (946,000 m3) of oil a day.[275][276] The Port Arthur Refinery in Southeast Texas is the largest refinery in the U.S.[275] Texas is also a leader in natural gas production at 28.8 billion cubic feet (820,000,000 m3) per day, some 32% of the nation's production.[277] Texas has 102.4 trillion cubic feet (2.90×1012 m3) of gas reserves which is 23% of the nation's gas reserves.[275][276] Many petroleum companies are based in Texas such as: ConocoPhillips,[278] EOG Resources, ExxonMobil,[279] Halliburton,[280] Hilcorp, Marathon Oil,[281] Occidental Petroleum,[282] Valero Energy,[283] and Western Refining.[284] According to the Energy Information Administration, Texans consume, on average, the fifth most energy (of all types) in the nation per capita and as a whole, following behind Wyoming, Alaska, Louisiana, North Dakota, and Iowa.[275] Unlike the rest of the nation, most of Texas is on its own alternating current power grid, the Texas Interconnection. Texas has a deregulated electric service. Texas leads the nation in total net electricity production, generating 437,236 MWh in 2014, 89% more MWh than Florida, which ranked second.[285][286] The state is a leader in renewable energy commercialization; it produces the most wind power in the nation.[275][287] In 2014, 10.6% of the electricity consumed in Texas came from wind turbines.[288] The Roscoe Wind Farm in Roscoe, Texas, is one of the world's largest wind farms with a 781.5 megawatt (MW) capacity.[289] The Energy Information Administration states the state's large agriculture and forestry industries could give Texas an enormous amount of biomass for use in biofuels. The state also has the highest solar power potential for development in the U.S.[275] With large universities systems coupled with initiatives like the Texas Enterprise Fund and the Texas Emerging Technology Fund, a wide array of different high tech industries have developed in Texas. The Austin area is nicknamed the \"Silicon Hills\" and the north Dallas area the \"Silicon Prairie\". Many high-tech companies are located in or have their headquarters in Texas (and Austin in particular), including Dell, Inc.,[290] Borland,[291] Forcepoint,[292] Indeed.com,[293] Texas Instruments,[294] Perot Systems,[295] Rackspace and AT&T.[296][297][298] The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (NASA JSC) is located in Southeast Houston. Both SpaceX and Blue Origin have their test facilities in Texas.[299][300] Fort Worth hosts both Lockheed Martin's Aeronautics division and Bell Helicopter Textron.[301][302] Lockheed builds the F-16 Fighting Falcon, the largest Western fighter program, and its successor, the F-35 Lightning II in Fort Worth.[303] Texas's affluence stimulates a strong commercial sector consisting of retail, wholesale, banking and insurance, and construction industries. Examples of Fortune 500 companies not based on Texas traditional industries are AT&T, Kimberly-Clark, Blockbuster, J. C. Penney, Whole Foods Market, and Tenet Healthcare.[304] Nationally, the Dallas–Fort Worth area, home to the second shopping mall in the United States, has the most shopping malls per capita of any American metropolitan statistical area.[305] Mexico, the state's largest trading partner, imports a third of the state's exports because of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). NAFTA has encouraged the formation of maquiladoras on the Texas–Mexico border.[306] Historically, Texas culture comes from a blend of mostly Southern (Dixie), Western (frontier), and Southwestern (Mexican/Anglo fusion) influences, varying in degrees of such from one intrastate region to another. A popular food item, the breakfast burrito, draws from all three, having a soft flour tortilla wrapped around bacon and scrambled eggs or other hot, cooked fillings. Adding to Texas's traditional culture, established in the 18th and 19th centuries, immigration has made Texas a melting pot of cultures from around the world.[307][308] Texas has made a strong mark on national and international pop culture. The entire state is strongly associated with the image of the cowboy shown in westerns and in country western music. The state's numerous oil tycoons are also a popular pop culture topic as seen in the hit TV series Dallas.[309] The internationally known slogan \"Don't Mess with Texas\" began as an anti-littering advertisement. Since the campaign's inception in 1986, the phrase has become \"an identity statement, a declaration of Texas swagger\".[310] \"Texas-sized\" describes something that is about the size of the U.S. state of Texas,[311][312] or something (usually but not always originating from Texas) that is large compared to other objects of its type.[313][314][315] Texas was the largest U.S. state until Alaska became a state in 1959. The phrase \"everything is bigger in Texas\" has been in regular use since at least 1950.[316] Houston is one of only five American cities with permanent professional resident companies in all the major performing arts disciplines: the Houston Grand Opera, the Houston Symphony Orchestra, the Houston Ballet, and The Alley Theatre.[317] Known for the vibrancy of its visual and performing arts, the Houston Theater District ranks second in the country in the number of theater seats in a concentrated downtown area, with 12,948 seats for live performances and 1,480 movie seats.[317] Founded in 1892, Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, also called \"The Modern\", is Texas's oldest art museum. Fort Worth also has the Kimbell Art Museum, the Amon Carter Museum, the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame, the Will Rogers Memorial Center, and the Bass Performance Hall downtown. The Arts District of Downtown Dallas has arts venues such as the Dallas Museum of Art, the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center, the Margot and Bill Winspear Opera House, the Trammell & Margaret Crow Collection of Asian Art, and the Nasher Sculpture Center.[318] The Deep Ellum district within Dallas became popular during the 1920s and 1930s as the prime jazz and blues hotspot in the Southern United States. The name Deep Ellum comes from local people pronouncing \"Deep Elm\" as \"Deep Ellum\".[319] Artists such as Blind Lemon Jefferson, Robert Johnson, Huddie \"Lead Belly\" Ledbetter, and Bessie Smith played in early Deep Ellum clubs.[320] Austin, The Live Music Capital of the World, boasts \"more live music venues per capita than such music hotbeds as Nashville, Memphis, Los Angeles, Las Vegas or New York City\".[321] The city's music revolves around the nightclubs on 6th Street; events like the film, music, and multimedia festival South by Southwest; the longest-running concert music program on American television, Austin City Limits; and the Austin City Limits Music Festival held in Zilker Park.[322] Since 1980, San Antonio has evolved into \"The Tejano Music Capital Of The World\".[323] The Tejano Music Awards have provided a forum to create greater awareness and appreciation for Tejano music and culture.[324] Within the \"Big Four\" professional leagues, Texas has two NFL teams (the Dallas Cowboys and the Houston Texans), two MLB teams (the Houston Astros and the Texas Rangers),[325][326] three NBA teams (the San Antonio Spurs, the Houston Rockets, and the Dallas Mavericks), and one NHL team (the Dallas Stars). The Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex is one of only thirteen American metropolitan areas that host sports teams from all the \"Big Four\" professional leagues. Outside of the \"Big Four\", Texas also has a WNBA team (the Dallas Wings), three Major League Soccer teams (Austin FC, Houston Dynamo FC and FC Dallas), and one NWSL team (the Houston Dash).[citation needed] Collegiate athletics have deep significance in Texas culture, especially football. The state has twelve Division I-FBS schools, the most in the nation. Four of the state's schools claim at least one national championship in football: the Texas Longhorns, the Texas A&M Aggies, the TCU Horned Frogs, and the SMU Mustangs.[327][328][329][330] According to a survey of Division I-A coaches, the rivalry between the University of Oklahoma and the University of Texas at Austin, the Red River Shootout, ranks the third-best in the nation.[331] The TCU Horned Frogs and SMU Mustangs also share a rivalry and compete annually in the Battle for the Iron Skillet. A fierce rivalry, the Lone Star Showdown, also exists between the state's two largest universities, Texas A&M University and the University of Texas at Austin. The athletics portion of the Lone Star Showdown rivalry has been put on hold after the Texas A&M Aggies joined the Southeastern Conference.[332] The University Interscholastic League (UIL) organizes most primary and secondary school competitions. Events organized by UIL include contests in athletics (the most popular being high school football) as well as artistic and academic subjects.[333] Texans also enjoy rodeo. The world's first rodeo was hosted in Pecos, Texas.[334] The annual Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo is the largest rodeo in the world. The Southwestern Exposition and Livestock Show in Fort Worth is the oldest continuously running rodeo incorporating many of the state's most historic traditions into its annual events. Dallas hosts the State Fair of Texas each year at Fair Park.[335] Texas Motor Speedway hosts annual NASCAR Cup Series and IndyCar Series auto races since 1997. Since 2012, Austin's Circuit of the Americas plays host to a round of the Formula 1 World Championship.[336] The Panther City Lacrosse Club is a professional lacrosse team in the National Lacrosse League. They have played local matches at Dickies Arena in Fort Worth, Texas since their inaugural 2021–2022 season.[337] The second president of the Republic of Texas, Mirabeau B. Lamar, is the Father of Texas Education. During his term, the state set aside three leagues in each county for public schools. An additional 50 leagues of land set aside for the support of two universities would later become the basis of the state's Permanent University Fund.[338] Lamar's actions set the foundation for a Texas-wide public school system.[339] Between 2006 and 2007, Texas spent $7,275 per pupil, ranking it below the national average of $9,389. The pupil/teacher ratio was 14.9, below the national average of 15.3. Texas paid instructors $41,744, below the national average of $46,593. The Texas Education Agency (TEA) administers the state's public school systems. Texas has over 1,000 school districts; all districts except the Stafford Municipal School District are independent from municipal government and many cross city boundaries.[340] School districts have the power to tax their residents and to assert eminent domain over privately owned property. Due to court-mandated equitable school financing, the state has a tax redistribution system called the \"Robin Hood plan\" which transfers property tax revenue from wealthy school districts to poor ones.[341] The TEA has no authority over private or homeschooling activities.[342] Students in Texas take the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR) in primary and secondary school. STAAR assess students' attainment of reading, writing, mathematics, science, and social studies skills required under Texas education standards and the No Child Left Behind Act. The test replaced the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) test in the 2011–2012 school year.[343] Generally prohibited in the Western world, school corporal punishment is not unusual in the more conservative, rural areas of the state,[344][345][346] with 28,569 public school students paddled at least one time,[g] according to government data for the 2011–2012 school year.[347] The rate of school corporal punishment in Texas is surpassed only by Mississippi, Alabama, and Arkansas.[347] The state's two most widely recognized flagship universities are The University of Texas at Austin and Texas A&M University, ranked as the 21st[348] and 41st[349] best universities in the nation according to 2020's latest Center for World University Rankings report, respectively. Some observers[350] also include the University of Houston and Texas Tech University as tier one flagships alongside UT Austin and A&M.[351][352] The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board ranks the state's public universities into three distinct tiers:[353] Texas's alternative affirmative action plan, Texas House Bill 588, guarantees Texas students who graduated in the top 10 percent of their high school class automatic admission to state-funded universities. This does not apply to The University of Texas at Austin, which automatically admits Texas students who graduated in the top 6 percent of their high school class.[356] The bill encourages demographic diversity while attempting to avoid problems stemming from the Hopwood v. Texas (1996) case.[357] Thirty-six public universities exist in Texas, of which 32 belong to one of the six state university systems.[358][359] Discovery of minerals on Permanent University Fund land, particularly oil, has helped fund the rapid growth of the state's two largest university systems: the University of Texas System and the Texas A&M System. The four other university systems: the University of Houston System, the University of North Texas System, the Texas State System, and the Texas Tech System are not funded by the Permanent University Fund.[360] The Carnegie Foundation classifies four of Texas's universities as Tier One research institutions: The University of Texas at Austin, the Texas A&M University, the University of Houston and Texas Tech University. The University of Texas at Austin and Texas A&M University are the flagship universities of the University of Texas System and Texas A&M University System, respectively. Both were established by the Texas Constitution and hold stakes in the Permanent University Fund.[360] The state has sought to expand the number of flagship universities by elevating some of its seven institutions designated as \"emerging research universities\". The two expected to emerge first are the University of Houston and Texas Tech University, likely in that order according to discussions on the House floor of the 82nd Texas Legislature.[361] The state is home to various private institutions of higher learning—ranging from liberal arts colleges to a nationally recognized top-tier research university. Rice University in Houston is one of the leading teaching and research universities of the United States and is ranked the nation's 17th-best overall university by U.S. News & World Report.[362] Trinity University, a private, primarily undergraduate liberal arts university in San Antonio, has ranked first among universities granting primarily bachelor's and select master's degrees in the Western United States for 20 consecutive years by U.S. News.[363] Private universities include Abilene Christian University, Austin College, Baylor University, University of Mary Hardin–Baylor, and Southwestern University.[364][365][366] Universities in Texas host three presidential libraries: George Bush Presidential Library at Texas A&M University,[367] the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum at The University of Texas at Austin,[368][369] and the George W. Bush Presidential Library at Southern Methodist University.[370] Notwithstanding the concentration of elite medical centers in the state, The Commonwealth Fund ranks the Texas healthcare system the third worst in the nation.[371] Texas ranks close to last in access to healthcare, quality of care, avoidable hospital spending, and equity.[371] In May 2006, Texas initiated the program \"code red\" in response to the report the state had 25.1 percent of the population without health insurance, the largest proportion in the nation.[372] The Trust for America's Health ranked Texas 15th highest in adult obesity: 27.2 percent of the state's population is obese.[373] The 2008 Men's Health obesity survey ranked four Texas cities among the top 25 fattest cities in America: Houston ranked 6th, Dallas 7th, El Paso 8th, and Arlington 14th.[374] Texas had only one city (Austin, ranked 21st) in the top 25 \"fittest cities\" in America.[374] The state is ranked forty-second in the percentage of residents who engage in regular exercise according to a 2007 study.[375] Texas has the highest maternal mortality rate in the developed world, and the rate by which Texas women died from pregnancy-related complications doubled from 2010 to 2014, to 23.8 per 100,000—a rate unmatched in any other U.S. state or economically developed country.[376] In May 2021, the state legislature passed the Texas Heartbeat Act, which banned abortion from as early as six weeks of pregnancy, except to save the life of the mother. The Act allows private citizens to sue abortion providers and anyone else who assists in an abortion, except for the woman on whom the abortion is performed.[377][378] On August 25, 2022, another law took effect that made committing abortion at any stage of pregnancy a felony punishable by life in prison.[379] Texas has many elite research medical centers. The state has 15 medical schools,[380] four dental schools,[381] and two optometry schools.[382] Texas has two Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) laboratories: one at The University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) in Galveston,[383] and the other at the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research in San Antonio—the first privately owned BSL-4 lab in the United States.[384] The Texas Medical Center in Houston holds the world's largest concentration of research and healthcare institutions, with over 50 member institutions.[385] Texas Medical Center performs the most heart transplants in the world.[386] The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston is a highly regarded academic institution that centers around cancer patient care, research, education and prevention.[387] San Antonio's South Texas Medical Center facilities rank sixth in clinical medicine research impact in the United States.[388] The University of Texas Health Science Center is another highly ranked research and educational institution in San Antonio.[389][390] Both the American Heart Association and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center call Dallas home.[391] The institution's medical school employs the most medical school Nobel laureates in the world.[391][392] The state's large size and rough terrain have historically complicated transportation. Texas has compensated by building the nation's largest highway and railway systems. The regulatory authority, the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), maintains the state's highway system, regulates aviation,[393] and public transportation systems.[394] The state is an important transportation hub. From the Dallas/Fort Worth area, trucks can reach 93 percent of the nation's population within 48 hours, and 37 percent within 24 hours.[395] Texas has 33 foreign trade zones (FTZ), the most in the nation.[396] In 2004, a combined total of $298 billion of goods passed through Texas FTZs.[396] The first Texas freeway was the Gulf Freeway opened in 1948 in Houston.[397] As of 2005, 79,535 miles (127,999 km) of public highway crisscrossed Texas (up from 71,000 miles or 114,000 km in 1984).[citation needed] To fund recent growth in the state highways, Texas has 17 toll roads with several additional tollways proposed.[398] In Central Texas, the southern section of the State Highway 130 toll road has a speed limit of 85 miles per hour (137 km/h), the highest in the nation.[399] All federal and state highways in Texas are paved. Texas has 730 airports, second-most of any state in the nation. Largest in Texas by size and passengers served, Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) is the second-largest by area in the United States, and fourth in the world with 18,076 acres (73.15 km2).[400] In traffic, DFW airport is the busiest in the state, the fourth busiest in the United States,[401] and sixth worldwide.[402] Southwest Airlines, headquartered in Dallas, has its operations at Dallas Love Field.[403] American Airlines Group's American / American Eagle, the world's largest airline in total passengers-miles transported and passenger fleet size,[404] uses DFW as its largest and main hub. Texas's second-largest air facility is Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH). It serves as the largest hub for United Airlines, the world's third-largest airline, by passenger-miles flown.[405][h] IAH offers service to the most Mexican destinations of any U.S. airport.[406][407] The next five largest airports in the state all serve more than three million passengers annually; they include Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, William P. Hobby Airport, San Antonio International Airport, Dallas Love Field and El Paso International Airport. The smallest airport in the state to be designated an international airport is Del Rio International Airport. Around 1,150 seaports dot Texas's coast with over 1,000 miles (1,600 km) of channels.[408] Ports employ nearly one-million people and handle an average of 317 million metric tons.[409] Texas ports connect with the rest of the U.S. Atlantic seaboard with the Gulf section of the Intracoastal Waterway.[408] The Port of Houston today is the busiest port in the United States in foreign tonnage, second in overall tonnage, and tenth worldwide in tonnage.[410] The Houston Ship Channel spans 530 feet (160 m) wide by 45 feet (14 m) deep by 50 miles (80 km) long.[411] Part of the state's tradition of cowboys is derived from the massive cattle drives which its ranchers organized in the nineteenth century to drive livestock to railroads and markets. The first railroad to operate in Texas was the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos and Colorado Railway, opening in August 1853.[412] The first railroad to enter Texas from the north, completed in 1872, was the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad.[413] With increasing railroad access, the ranchers did not have to take their livestock up to the Midwest and shipped beef out from Texas. This caused a decline in the economies of the cow towns.[414] Since 1911, Texas has led the nation in length of railroad miles within the state. Texas railway length peaked in 1932 at 17,078 miles (27,484 km), but declined to 14,006 miles (22,540 km) by 2000. While the Railroad Commission of Texas originally regulated state railroads, in 2005 the state reassigned these duties to TxDOT.[415] In the Dallas–Fort Worth area, three public transit agencies provide rail service: Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART), Denton County Transportation Authority (DCTA), and Trinity Metro. DART began operating the first light rail system in the Southwest United States in 1996.[416] The Trinity Railway Express (TRE) commuter rail service, which connects Fort Worth and Dallas, is provided by Trinity Metro and DART.[417] Trinity Metro also operates the TEXRail commuter rail line, connecting downtown Fort Worth and Northeast Tarrant County to DFW Airport.[418] The A-train commuter rail line, operated by DCTA, acts as an extension of the DART Green line into Denton County.[419] In the Austin area, Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority operates a commuter rail service known as Capital MetroRail to the northwestern suburbs. The Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County, Texas (METRO) operates light rail lines called METRORail in the Houston area.[420] Amtrak provides Texas with limited intercity passenger rail service. Three scheduled routes serve the state: the daily Texas Eagle (Chicago–San Antonio); the tri-weekly Sunset Limited (New Orleans–Los Angeles), with stops in Texas; and the daily Heartland Flyer (Fort Worth–Oklahoma City). Texas may get one of the nation's first high-speed rail line. Plans for a privately funded high-speed rail line between Dallas and Houston have been planned by the Texas Central Railway company.[421] The current Texas Constitution was adopted in 1876. Like many states, it explicitly provides for a separation of powers. The state's Bill of Rights is much larger than its federal counterpart, and has provisions unique to Texas.[422] Texas has a plural executive branch system limiting the power of the governor, which is a weak executive compared to some other states. Except for the secretary of state, voters elect executive officers independently; candidates are directly answerable to the public, not the governor.[423] This election system has led to some executive branches split between parties and reduced the ability of the governor to carry out a program. When Republican president George W. Bush served as Texas's governor, the state had a Democratic lieutenant governor, Bob Bullock. The executive branch positions consist of the governor, lieutenant governor, comptroller of public accounts, land commissioner, attorney general, agriculture commissioner, the three-member Texas Railroad Commission, the State Board of Education, and the secretary of state.[423] The bicameral Texas Legislature consists of the House of Representatives, with 150 members, and a Senate, with 31 members. The Speaker of the House leads the House, and the lieutenant governor, the Senate.[424] The Legislature meets in regular session biennially for just over a hundred days, but the governor can call for special sessions as often as desired (notably, the Legislature cannot call itself into session).[425] The state's fiscal year begins September 1.[426] The judiciary of Texas is among the most complex in the United States, with many layers and overlapping jurisdictions. Texas has two courts of last resort: the Texas Supreme Court, for civil cases, and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. Except for some municipal benches, partisan elections select judges at all levels of the judiciary; the governor fills vacancies by appointment.[427] Texas is notable for its use of capital punishment, having led the country in executions since capital punishment was reinstated in the Gregg v. Georgia case.[428] The Texas Ranger Division of the Texas Department of Public Safety is a law enforcement agency with statewide jurisdiction. Over the years, the Texas Rangers have investigated crimes ranging from murder to political corruption. They have acted as riot police and as detectives, protected the Texas governor, tracked down fugitives, and functioned as a paramilitary force. The Texas Rangers were unofficially created by Stephen F. Austin in 1823 and formally constituted in 1835. The Rangers were integral to several important events of Texas history and some of the best-known criminal cases in the history of the Old West.[429] The Texas constitution defines the responsibilities of county governments, which serve as agents of the state. Commissioners court and court judges are elected to serve as the administrative arm. Most cities in the state, those over 5,000 in population, have home-rule governments. The vast majority of these have charters for council-manager forms of government, by which voters elect council members, who hire a professional city manager as an operating officer.[430] The Democratic Party dominated Texas politics from the turn of the 20th century, imposing racial segregation and white supremacy. It held power until after passage in the mid-1960s of national civil rights legislation enforcing constitutional rights of all citizens.[431][432] The state's conservative White voters began to support Republican presidential candidates by the mid-20th century. After this period, they supported Republicans for local and state offices as well, and most Whites became Republican Party members.[433] The party also attracted some minorities, but many have continued to vote for Democratic candidates. The shift to the Republican Party is much-attributed to the fact the Democratic Party became increasingly liberal during the 20th century, and thus increasingly out-of-touch with the average Texas voter.[434] As Texas was always a conservative state, voters switched to the Republicans, which now more closely reflected their beliefs.[434][435] Commentators have also attributed the shift to Republican political consultant Karl Rove, who managed numerous political campaigns in Texas in the 1980s and 1990s.[435] Other stated reasons included court-ordered redistricting and the demographic shift in relation to the Sun Belt that favored the Republican Party and conservatism.[126] The 2003 Texas redistricting of Congressional districts led by Republican Tom DeLay, was called by The New York Times \"an extreme case of partisan gerrymandering\".[436] A group of Democratic legislators, the \"Texas Eleven\", fled the state in a quorum-busting effort to prevent the legislature from acting, but was unsuccessful.[437] The state had already redistricted following the 2000 census. Despite these efforts, the legislature passed a map heavily in favor of Republicans, based on 2000 data and ignoring the estimated nearly one million new residents in the state since then. Career attorneys and analysts at the Department of Justice objected to the plan as diluting the votes of African American and Hispanic voters, but political appointees overrode them and approved it.[436] Legal challenges to the redistricting reached the national Supreme Court in the case League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry (2006), but the court ruled in favor of the state (and Republicans).[438] In the 2014 Texas elections, the Tea Party movement made large gains, with numerous Tea Party favorites being elected into office, including Dan Patrick as lieutenant governor,[439][440] Ken Paxton as attorney general,[439][441] in addition to numerous other candidates[441] including conservative Republican Greg Abbott as governor.[442] Texas voters lean toward fiscal conservatism, while enjoying the benefits of significant federal investment in the state in military and other facilities achieved by the power of the Solid South in the 20th century. They also tend to have socially conservative values.[260][443] Since 1980, most Texas voters have supported Republican presidential candidates. Austin, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and El Paso consistently lean Democratic in both local and statewide elections.[128] Residents of counties along the Rio Grande closer to the Mexico–United States border, where there are many Latino residents, generally vote for Democratic Party candidates, while most other rural and suburban areas of Texas have shifted to voting for Republican Party candidates.[444][445] As of the midterm elections of 2022, a large majority of the members of Texas's U.S. House delegation are Republican, along with both U.S. Senators. In the 119th United States Congress, of the 38 Congressional districts in Texas, 25 are held by Republicans and 13 by Democrats. Texas's Senators are John Cornyn and Ted Cruz. Since 1994, Texans have not elected a Democrat to a statewide office. The state's Democratic voters are made up primarily by liberal and minority groups in Austin, Beaumont, Dallas, El Paso, Houston, and San Antonio as well as minority voters in East and South Texas.[446][447][448] According to a study by the Cato Institute, Texas ranks last in personal freedom among the states, by factors including incarceration rates, cannabis laws, civil asset forfeiture policies, educational freedom, gambling laws, marriage freedom, and travel freedom.[449][450] Lesser parties that have ballot access are the Green Party and the Libertarian Party.[451] Texas has a reputation of very harsh criminal punishment for criminal offenses. It is one of the 32 states that practice capital punishment, and since the US Supreme Court allowed capital punishment to resume in 1976, 40% of all U.S. executions have taken place in Texas.[452] As of 2018, Texas had the 8th highest incarceration rate in the U.S.[453] Texas also has strong right of self-defense and self defense laws, allowing citizens to use lethal force to defend themselves, their families, or their property.[454] Texas has one of the strictest abortion bans in the country.[455] 31°N 99°W﻿ / ﻿31°N 99°W﻿ / 31; -99﻿ (State of Texas)",

                "content": "Texas (/ˈtɛksəs/, also locally /ˈtɛksɪz/ American Spanish: [tejaz][8]), officially the State of Texas, is a state in the South Central Region of the United States. It is the second largest US state by total area (after Alaska) with 268,596 sq mi (695,662 km2) and population (after California) with nearly 29 million people as of 2019. Its largest cities are Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio, El Paso, and Austin, the capital city. Texas became the 28th state in the United States in 1845. Texas has been controlled by Spain, France, the Confederate States of America, and Mexico. It declared its independence from Mexico in 1836. It was its own country, the Republic of Texas, for 9 years (1836–1845). It is called the \"Lone Star State\" and its flag has one star. There are many tourist attractions in Texas. Fort Worth is known for its stockyards. Amarillo is known for the cattle business and stockyards. In Dallas, industrial technology companies including Texas Instruments and EDS have their home offices. San Antonio has The Alamo. Houston has the Johnson Space Center. Austin has the University of Texas at Austin. Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Baylor University in Waco and the University of North Texas in Denton are other important universities in the state. The state's name derives from táyshay, a word in the Caddoan language of the Hasinai (a Native American tribe), which means \"allies\" or \"friends.\" Texas was first explored in 1528 by Spanish explorers on accident (they were shipwrecked on the coast). It did not become a colony until 1685, when France claimed it. In response, Spain started a rival colony in 1691 by setting up a religious outpost in the eastern part of Texas. Spain did not come back to Texas until 1716 to protect its colonies in the west from French forces. Two years later, San Antonio was founded. The pressure between the Spaniards and Native Americans in East Texas stopped many settlers from coming to Texas. To stop the violence and the increasing Native American raids, Spain called a truce between many tribes in 1745 and 1789. Tensions rose in Texas after the United States bought a large amount of nearby land from France in 1803. This was the Louisiana Purchase. People began wondering whether Spain or the United States could claim Texas. Mexico won the Mexican War of Independence in 1821. Mexico, including Texas, was free from the Spanish Empire. Americans and other settlers came into Texas when Mexico allowed non-Spanish settlers to settle here. After many settlers came to Texas, Mexico started taxing non-citizens. This outraged many settlers. Many were already angry because Mexico banned slavery. Politics in Mexico became violent and several Mexican States declared independence. On March 2, 1836, Texas declared independence from Mexico and soon they were at war. Texas won, but Mexico refused to recognize Texas as an independent sovereign Republic. Texas soon requested entry to the United States. Years later, in 1845, the US added Texas as a state,[9] and Mexico broke off diplomatic relations. Mexico resisted offers by the U.S. to buy land extending from Texas to the Pacific Ocean. In 1846, a dispute over the border between Texas and Mexico resulted in armed conflict, and the Mexican-American War began. The United States won the war, and by the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, in 1848 won lands that later formed the states of California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, southwestern Colorado, and southwestern Wyoming. Mexico received 15 million dollars and gave up its claims to Texas. After Abraham Lincoln was elected President of the United States, Texas joined the newly formed Confederate States of America in 1861 and fought in the American Civil War in an attempt to become independent from the United States. The Confederates lost to the Union (the United States) in 1865. Texas was restored to full representation in Congress on March 30, 1870. On January 10, 1901, oil was found in Texas, leading to the founding of a richer economy. During a time when the economy was poor, many people left Texas. Texas did not regain the population it had lost until the 1950s and 60s. In recent years, Texas has become a hub for technology and computers. Texas is the second biggest state in the Union (after Alaska) and is bigger than every European country except Russia. It has mountains, forests, deserts, plains, and coasts. The largest river in Texas is the Rio Grande, which forms the border between Mexico and the United States throughout south Texas. The highest mountain in Texas is Guadalupe Peak. Most of Texas is in Central Time, but El Paso in Western Texas is in Mountain Time.[10] Texas has the second largest economy in the United States after the economy of California. It had a gross state product of US$1.887 trillion in 2019.[11] Texas was home to six of the top 50 companies on the Fortune 500 list in 2015 (third most after New York and California).[12] In 2017, Texas grossed more than US$264.5 billion a year in exports—more than the exports of California (US$172 billion) and New York (US$77.9 billion) combined.[13][14][15] As a sovereign country, in 2016, Texas would be the 10th largest economy in the world by gross domestic product (GDP), ahead of South Korea and Canada and behind Brazil.[16]",

                "title": "The Telsa Model Y \"Juniper\" gets a brand-new face and more",
                "content": "Tesla's Model Y electric crossover SUV became the world's best-selling car of 2023. Not just the best-selling EV, but the best-selling vehicle, even outselling the Toyota Corolla, making the Model Y a key player in EV adoption. Now we get to see what's new in the 2025 version. Only yesterday, Tesla China's website quietly revealed the 2025 Model Y, which is codenamed \"Juniper.\" Tesla is doubling down in 2025 on its success and gave the EV – known for its performance, range and versatility – a refresh by adding new features and design improvements. Starting with what everyone sees first, the exterior has a completely new look. The front bumper and headlights have been redesigned giving it a sleeker, more modern look. The rear, also redesigned, still screams \"TESLA!\" when you look at it, but now has a full-width rear tail light, reminiscent of a Cylon in Battlestar Galactica. Knowing Elon Musk's quirky antics, that very well may have been the goal. The 19-inch wheels have gotten an update as well. And what you can't see behind them are suspension tweaks for a smoother ride and better handling. Another nifty feature is the ability of the \"frunk\" and trunk to open up for you when you're nearby, making it easy to toss in your groceries or luggage as you approach the SUV without having to open any latches. We're not sure if the Tentsla is still compatible with the new design yet. Once you hop inside, you'll notice right away that gone are the 2023-24 touch-sensitive turn signal buttons, replaced with the return of the beloved physical stalk to indicate your turns – thus proving the point, \"If it ain't broke, fix it 'til it is\" ... then just go back to what worked best in the first place. You'll also notice improvements in the quality and feel of the interior, such as sleek ambient lighting. The interior has also been upgraded with more advanced acoustic materials – including those in the windshield – to make for a quieter, more luxurious ride. The 2025 Model Y Juniper also gets the full self-driving (FSD) suite found on many other Tesla models. Active safety features include a pre-collision warning, automatic emergency braking, plus lane deviation and avoidance. Passengers in the rear now get an 8-inch touchscreen for zone climate control as well as entertainment options. That screen might be tough to reach with a seatbelt on, so Tesla allows passengers to connect to entertainment functions via Bluetooth, making it easy to play some games or click on some Bluey for the kids on a long drive. If you have pets, the Model Y also has a pet-safe mode to keep the interior at a comfortable temperature, should you need to leave your puppers alone in the car. Quite a few other aspects of the new dual-motor, all-wheel-drive Model Y caught an upgrade as well. There's price, for one. The 2025 model comes in at US$41,390, down about $7,600 from the 2023 version. The new Model Y Juniper has a CLTC estimated 446-mile (718-km) range over the 2023 EPA 330-mile (531 km) range. To be fair, the CLTC (China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle) leans towards the optimistic side of EV range, to say the least. Usually 15-20% higher than real-world estimates like the EPA. So we'll call the range of the new Model Y something more like 350-360 miles (563-579 km) on a single charge. The outgoing 2023 model has around 346 hp and a 3,500-lb (1,588-kg) towing capacity. Specs for the Juniper are likely to be similar, but haven't been disclosed publicly yet. Battery pack size also isn't disclosed publicly for the Model Y, but it's estimated that the 2023 version was around 75 kWh. Of Tesla's range of vehicles – the Model S, 3, X, and Y – the Y has been the best-selling with 1.2 million sold worldwide in 2023, roughly 200,000 more than the next best-selling compact SUV – EV or otherwise – the Toyota Rav4.

Start your Independent Premium subscription today. The Independent's Electric Vehicles Channel is sponsored by E.ON Next. The all-new 2025 Tesla Model Y has been revealed in full on Tesla’s websites in China and Australia, putting to end months of rumours and speculation about the details on the replacement for what was the world’s best-selling car in 2023 and the UK’s best-selling electric car in 2024. The Model Y is built in Tesla’s factory in Shanghai, where most of the recent spy shots have been taken. China is the biggest market for the Model Y, while the Chinese plant also makes right-hand drive models for Australia and the UK. With the car already on sale in Australia, with prices starting at AUD 63,400 (£31,900) for the Rear-Wheel Drive car, it could mean that we get the new Model Y in the UK before some other markets. Codenamed Juniper, the new EV looks remarkably similar to our own rendering produced late last year, showing a Tesla Cybertruck-inspired full-width slim LED light bar at the front of the car that also looks similar to the recently revealed fully-autonomous Tesla Cybercab, too. The main headlights sit just below the light bar in a smoother front bumper that’s more aerodynamic and features a new camera for enhanced Autopilot functions that the new car is expected to bring – Tesla’s ‘full self-driving’ will be available where it’s legal to use. There’s a similar design story at the back of the new Model Y, with new C-shaped LED taillights that blend into a full-width light bar that uses reflective lighting and features the Tesla lettering set into it at the bottom. The Model Y name sits on the left of the boot door, with the dual motor badge – in the case of the car in the pictures – on the right hand side. The boot door can now open automatically as you approach the car, and there’s more luggage space inside, too: a total of 2,130 litres including the frunk under the front bonnet. The profile of the car is very similar to the current model, complete with the camera housing that sits in a design feature on the flank behind the front wheels. There’s still the trademark Tesla deep front windscreen that flows into a full-length glass panoramic roof. There are new, more aerodynamic wheels, too, while the length of the car has increased slightly to boost aerodynamics and efficiency. Five colours are available, including the new glacier blue in our pictures. Also available are stealth grey, pearl white, quicksilver and ultra red. The look of the cabin remains pretty much the same as in the outgoing car – and the Tesla Model 3 that was heavily revised at the start of 2024. However, while the Model 3 lost both stalks behind the steering wheel, only one of the stalks behind the new Model Y’s steering wheel is missing. Tesla appears to have listened to feedback from Model 3 owners who’ve found it difficult using buttons on the steering wheel rather than a traditional stalk to select the indicators. Pictures of right-hand drive Model Ys on the Tesla Australia website show a traditional indicator stalk on the left-hand side of the steering wheel although the stalk for gear selection and autopilot on the right of the wheel in the old Model Y has gone. The controls for both of those functions have moved to the touchscreen. The steering wheel is also new on the Model Y, the new SUV using the same style of steering wheel as the new Model 3. The windows feature acoustic glazing for better soundproofing, while there’s an upgrade in material quality with softer fabrics used on the dash and doors. New ambient lighting is based on that found in the latest Model 3. Once again, white and black or full black interiors are on offer. The 15.4-inch central touchscreen remains, but is joined by an eight-inch touchscreen for rear passengers, which features games for anyone in the back seats to play. Those rear seats now fold electrically at the touch of a button, while the front seats now feature ventilation as well as heating. The new Model Y features new suspension, hubs and tyres, hopefully going some way to curing the overly firm ride of the old model, while a reduction in the number of parts in the chassis is also said to improve refinement, making the car quieter still. Only two ‘launch edition’ versions of the new Model Y feature on Tesla’s Chinese and Australian websites: a long range all-wheel drive car or a standard range car with rear-drive. There’s no word on battery size, but according to Tesla’s Australian website, the long range all-wheel drive car will go up to 342 miles, while the standard range car will travel up to 290 miles on a full charge – both figures are handy increases over the current Model Y which claims a maximum of 331 miles for the Long Range All-Wheel Drive car. Charging speeds are rated at up to 250kW for the long range car or 170kW for the standard range model. When it comes to performance, the longer range Model Y gets from zero to 62mph in 4.3 seconds with the standard range car following in 5.9 seconds. Both claim a maximum speed of 125mph. A performance version of the Model Y, wearing the same Tesla Performance badging as the new Model 3 with subtle spoilers front and rear, is expected to arrive later in 2025. With production of the new Model Y underway and ramping up and the car on sale in China and Australia it could be a matter of days before the car pops up on Tesla’s website in the UK, with deliveries expected later on in the first quarter of the year. The Tesla Model 3 saw a small price rise when it was relaunched in early 2024, and the same would be expected for the new Tesla Model Y, especially with the improvements to tech, comfort and build quality. In China, the Long Range All-Wheel Drive car costs ¥303,500 (£33,600) with the Standard-Range Rear-Drive car costing ¥263,500 (£29,200). In Australia the long range car costs AUD 73,400 (£36,928) while the standard car costs UD 63,400 (£31,900). There currently isn’t a standard rear-drive Model Y on sale in the UK – as it stands the range starts at £46,990 for the Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive car. A standard rear-drive Model 3 costs £5,000 less than its Long Range Rear-Drive cousin, so allowing for a slight increase, we would expect a new standard Rear-Drive car to kick off the new Model Y range at around £43,000, with around a £10,000 premium for a Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive car. Elon Musk revealed at the recent Robotaxi event that the Model Y would have full self-driving capabilities where allowed. As with all Teslas, expect over-the-air updates to improve not only the tech on board, but efficiency, too. The new Model Y is on sale in China with both enhanced autopilot and full self-driving as options, with both likely to be offered in the UK, although the latter cannot yet be used on UK roads. The latest software updates to roll out across the Tesla range will also be on the new Model Y, with an updated phone and Apple Watch app that enables owners to use their watch as a key for their cars.

                "content": "Derrick Deshaun Watson (born September 14, 1995) is an American professional football quarterback for the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Clemson Tigers, leading the team to a national championship in 2016. Watson was selected in the first round of the 2017 NFL draft by the Houston Texans. After having a productive rookie season cut short by injury, Watson guided the Texans to consecutive division titles in 2018 and 2019 and led the league in passing yards in 2020. He also received Pro Bowl honors in each of his three seasons as Houston's primary starter. He is currently tenth in career completion percentage (minimum 1,500 attempts) and is sixth in all-time career passer rating.[1][2] In 2021, Watson was sued by more than two dozen female massage therapists for sexual harassment and sexual assault.[3][4] Watson has denied any wrongdoing while settling 20 claims of sexual misconduct.[5] Disagreements with the Texans' front office, and multiple sexual-misconduct lawsuits, kept Watson out for the entire 2021 season and eventually led to a trade to the Browns in 2022. With Cleveland, Watson signed a five-year contract worth $230 million, one of the largest contracts in NFL history.[6][7] Watson was born in Gainesville, Georgia, on September 14, 1995, to Deann Watson and Don Richardson. He attended Gainesville High School from the fall of 2010 and played for the school's Red Elephants football team.[8] Gainesville head coach Bruce Miller had planned to start a rising junior at quarterback to execute his spread offense, but Watson won the starting spot, becoming Miller's first-ever freshman starting quarterback.[9] During his high-school career, Watson set numerous state records, including those for total yards (17,134), total touchdowns (218), career passing yards (13,077) and career passing touchdowns (155).[10] He rushed for 4,057 yards and 63 touchdowns. Watson excelled in his junior year, winning a state championship and earning accolades such as Junior All-American, 2014 Player to Watch and 2014 Top 100 Recruit.[11] During his sophomore and senior years, Watson led Gainesville to the state semifinals.[12][13] Watson received offers from numerous colleges before verbally committing to Clemson University on February 1, 2012.[14] He was ranked as the top quarterback recruit for the 2014 class by ESPN 300.[11] Watson enrolled at Clemson in January 2014. During his high-school career, Watson had worn #4, but at Clemson, that number had been retired after quarterback Steve Fuller graduated. However, Fuller allowed Watson to wear the number.[15] Watson entered his true freshman season as the backup to starter Cole Stoudt, but still received extensive playing time.[16] Through three games, he completed 29 of 41 passes for 479 yards with four touchdowns and no interceptions, outperforming Stoudt. Watson was named the Tigers' starter on September 21.[17][18] In Watson's first career start against the North Carolina Tar Heels, he set a school record with six touchdown passes and threw for 435 yards en route to a 50–35 victory.[19] On October 11, 2014, Watson broke a bone in his right hand in the first quarter of a game against the Louisville Cardinals.[20][21] As a result of the injury, he missed games against Boston College, Syracuse and Wake Forest. He returned for a game against Georgia Tech only to suffer an LCL strain, missing most of the game.[22] He did not play against Georgia State the following week, but led Clemson to a victory over state rival South Carolina the following week.[23] It was revealed that Watson had played the game with a torn ACL in his left knee.[24] He underwent surgery the Friday before Clemson's bowl game against Oklahoma.[25] In 2015, Watson led Clemson to an undefeated 12–0 regular season and a #1 ranking in the polls.[26] After the regular season, the Tigers qualified for the ACC Championship Game, facing off against #10 North Carolina. Watson threw for 289 yards and three touchdowns and ran for 131 yards and two touchdowns to lead the Tigers to a 45–37 win, Clemson's first ACC championship since 2011.[27] Watson was also named the ACC Championship Game MVP.[28] The Tigers were selected to participate in the 2016 College Football Playoff as the #1 seed. They faced the #4 seed Oklahoma Sooners in the Orange Bowl, one of the two College Football Playoff semifinal games. Watson threw for 189 yards and a touchdown and ran for 145 yards and a touchdown as he led Clemson to a 37–17 victory, earning game MVP honors.[29][30] With the win, the Tigers advanced to the 2016 College Football Playoff National Championship game against the #2 Alabama Crimson Tide, but Clemson lost 45–40. Watson threw for 405 yards and four touchdowns in the game and ran for 73 yards in the losing effort,[31] though he surpassed the 4,000-yard passing mark.[32] He set the record for most total yards in national championship game history, with 478 yards (405 passing / 73 rushing) against the nation's best defense. In addition to throwing for over 4,000 yards, he also rushed for over 1,000 yards to complete his true sophomore season. Watson was the first player to accomplish this feat in the history of college football.[33] For his accomplishments during the 2015 season, Watson was named a finalist for the Heisman Trophy, the first time that a Clemson player had been invited to the Heisman Trophy presentation. He finished third in the balloting after Heisman winner Derrick Henry, an Alabama running back, and Stanford running back Christian McCaffrey.[34] Watson's third-place finish was the highest in Clemson football history. He won the Davey O'Brien Award, which is awarded annually to the top college quarterback.[35] He was also named the 2015 ACC Player of the Year and ACC Offensive Player of the Year.[36][37] Watson started his junior season positively with 248 passing yards, one touchdown, and one interception in a narrow 19–13 victory over the Auburn Tigers.[38] On October 1, Watson threw for 306 passing yards, five touchdowns, and three interceptions in a 42–36 victory over Louisville.[39] He totaled 378 passing yards and two touchdowns against Florida State on October 29, rallying to a 37–34 win.[40] Against Syracuse on November 5, he threw for 169 passing yards with two touchdowns but left the game with an apparent shoulder injury.[41][42] On November 26, he passed for 347 yards, six touchdowns and one interception in a 56–7 victory over South Carolina.[43] In the fall of 2016, Watson became the first player since Jason White in 2003–2004 to win the Davey O'Brien Award in consecutive years. He was also named winner of the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award and was the first repeat winner of the Manning Award.[44] For the second consecutive year, Watson was named one of the five Heisman Trophy candidates, along with Michigan's Jabrill Peppers, Oklahoma's Baker Mayfield and Dede Westbrook and Louisville's Lamar Jackson. He again came up short, as Louisville's Lamar Jackson was awarded the Heisman Trophy, finishing with nearly twice as many first-place votes as had Watson.[45][46] After defeating Ohio State 31–0 in the CFP semifinal in the Fiesta Bowl and receiving the offensive MVP award, Clemson defeated No. 1 Alabama 35–31 in the 2017 College Football Playoff National Championship.[47] Watson completed 36 of 56 passes for 420 yards and three touchdowns against the nation's top-ranked defense, including the last-second game-winning pass to wide receiver Hunter Renfrow. He also rushed for 43 yards and a touchdown.[48] The win marked Clemson's second national championship, ending a three-decade national-championship drought. Watson was named the game's offensive MVP.[49] On November 8, 2016, Watson, along with three other Clemson players, Wayne Gallman, Artavis Scott and Mike Williams,[50] declared for the NFL draft.[51] In December, Watson graduated with a degree in communications after three years at Clemson.[52] Watson was projected as a first-round pick by the majority of scouts and analysts. He was ranked as the top quarterback available in the draft by Sports Illustrated, Pro Football Focus and ESPN.[53][54][55] He was ranked the second-best quarterback by NFLDraftScout.com.[56] The Houston Texans drafted Watson in the first round (12th overall) of the 2017 NFL draft.[62] The Texans had acquired the pick from the Cleveland Browns, trading their 25th overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft and their first round pick in the 2018 NFL draft. Houston had already traded quarterback Brock Osweiler to Cleveland for draft picks earlier that year as part of what was widely considered the NFL's first major \"salary dump.\" Watson was the third quarterback taken in the draft behind Mitchell Trubisky, who went second overall to the Chicago Bears, and Patrick Mahomes, who went tenth overall to the Kansas City Chiefs.[63][64][65][66] On May 12, 2017, the Texans signed Watson to a four-year, $13.84 million contract featuring an $8.21 million signing bonus.[67] Watson made his first regular-season appearance on September 10, 2017, against the Jacksonville Jaguars. He entered the game after Tom Savage was benched at halftime and played for the remainder of the game. In the third quarter, he threw his first NFL touchdown, a four-yard pass to wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins. He finished with 102 passing yards, a touchdown and an interception as the Texans lost 29–7.[68][69] Watson made his first career start on September 14, his 22nd birthday, in an away game against the Cincinnati Bengals. He finished with 125 passing yards, 67 rushing yards and a 49-yard rushing touchdown as the Texans won 13–9.[70] In Week 4 against the Tennessee Titans, he completed 25 of 34 passes for 283 yards, four touchdowns, and an interception while also rushing for 24 yards and a touchdown as the Texans won 57–14. His five total scores tied the NFL rookie touchdown record.[71] He also became the first rookie to pass for at least four touchdowns and rush for one touchdown in a game since Hall of Famer Fran Tarkenton in 1961.[72] His performance earned him AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors.[73] Watson followed up his Week 4 performance with another great outing against the Kansas City Chiefs. In the 42–34 loss, Watson finished 16-of-31 for 261 yards and five touchdown passes, tying an NFL rookie record for touchdown passes thrown in a single game. He also rushed for 31 yards.[74] In Week 8 against the Seattle Seahawks, Watson posted his first game with over 400 passing yards. He finished with 402 passing yards, four touchdowns, three interceptions and 67 rushing yards, though the Texans lost 41–38. Watson threw 16 touchdowns in the month of October, setting the NFL record for touchdown passes by a rookie in a calendar month. He was named AFC Offensive Player of the Month and the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Month for October.[75] On November 2, Watson tore his ACL on a non-contact play during practice, prematurely ending his rookie season.[76] In seven games (six starts) during his rookie year, Watson amassed 1,699 passing yards, 19 touchdowns and eight interceptions while rushing for 269 yards and two touchdowns.[77][78] On November 8, Watson underwent successful surgery on his right knee to repair his ACL, and no further damage was reported.[79] Watson was ranked 50th by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2018 list.[80] He was named to the PFWA All-Rookie Team, becoming the second Texans quarterback to receive the award since David Carr had done so in 2002.[81] In the season opener on September 9 against the New England Patriots, Watson returned from injury and threw for 176 yards with a touchdown and an interception and rushed for 40 yards as the Texans lost 27–20.[82] After suffering broken ribs and a partially collapsed lung, Watson took a 12-hour bus ride from Houston to Jacksonville for a Week 7 game against the Jaguars rather than flying because of fears about the effects of air pressure on his chest.[83] He passed for 139 yards and a touchdown in the 20–7 victory.[84] The next week, Watson tied his career high with five touchdowns in a 42–23 victory over the Miami Dolphins.[85] Watson finished the regular season with a career-high 4,165 passing yards, 26 touchdowns, 9 interceptions, 551 rushing yards and 5 rushing touchdowns, as Houston went 11–5 and won the AFC South title.[86] Watson led the league in average time spent in the pocket and was second in average time before throwing.[87] Watson faced the most dropbacks under pressure (281) and tied for the fifth-most times sacked in a single season with 62.[88] In Watson's first postseason appearance, the Texans hosted the Indianapolis Colts in the Wild Card round. Watson completed 29 of 49 passes for 235 yards as the Texans lost 21–7.[89] On January 21, 2019, Watson was named to his first Pro Bowl, replacing the Super Bowl-bound Tom Brady.[90] He was ranked 51st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2019 list.[91] In the season opener against the New Orleans Saints, Watson completed 20 of 30 passes for 268 yards, three touchdowns, and an interception while also rushing for 40 yards and a touchdown as the Texans lost 28–30.[92][93] In a Week 3 27–20 road victory against the Los Angeles Chargers, he threw for 351 yards and three touchdowns, including a 53-yard touchdown to tight end Jordan Akins. Watson was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[94][95] Two weeks later against the Atlanta Falcons, Watson threw for 426 yards and five touchdowns with no interceptions for a perfect passer rating in a 53–32 victory, earning him his second AFC Offensive Player of the Week award.[96][97] In the next game against the Chiefs, Watson threw for 280 yards, a touchdown, and two interceptions. He also rushed 10 times for 42 yards and two touchdowns in the 31–24 road victory.[98] During Week 8 against the Oakland Raiders, he threw for 279 yards and three touchdowns in a 27–24 victory.[99] During a play near the end of the fourth quarter, Watson was kicked in the eye by defensive end Arden Key's cleat while escaping a sack but managed to blindly throw a touchdown pass to tight end Darren Fells.[100] During Week 13 against the Patriots, he threw for 234 yards and three touchdowns and caught a six-yard touchdown pass from wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins in a 28–22 victory[101] en route to his third AFC Offensive Player of the Week award of the season.[102] Watson helped lead the Texans to a 10–6 record and an AFC South title.[103] He finished the season with 3,852 passing yards, 26 passing touchdowns and 12 interceptions along with 413 rushing yards and seven rushing touchdowns.[104] In the Wild Card Round against the Buffalo Bills, Watson led the Texans back from a 16–0 deficit to win 22–19 in overtime, his first NFL playoff victory, despite being sacked seven times. He sealed the game by spinning out of a potential sack by two Bills defenders and finding Taiwan Jones, who ran to the Buffalo 10-yard line to set up the game-winning field goal in overtime.[105] He finished the game with 247 passing yards and a touchdown along with 55 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown.[106] In the divisional round against the Chiefs, Watson threw for 388 yards and two touchdowns and rushed for 37 yards and a touchdown as the Texans lost on the road 51–31 after having blown a 24–0 second-quarter lead.[107] On April 28, 2020, the Texans exercised the fifth-year option on Watson's contract.[108] On September 5, Watson signed a four-year, $177.5 million contract extension with $111 million in guarantees, keeping him under contract through the 2025 season.[109] This marked the second-most lucrative contract in NFL history after that of Aaron Rodgers.[110] In the Week 1 NFL Kickoff Game against the Chiefs, Watson threw for 253 yards, one touchdown and one interception and rushed for 27 yards and a touchdown during a 34–20 loss.[111] In Week 4 against the Minnesota Vikings, Watson threw for 300 yards and two touchdowns as the Texans lost 23–31.[112] In Week 11 against the Patriots, Watson threw for 344 yards and two touchdowns and rushed for 36 yards and another touchdown during a 27–20 win, earning the AFC Offensive Player of the Week award.[113][114] In Week 12, a 41–25 win over the Detroit Lions, Watson passed for 318 yards and four passing touchdowns.[115] With his Week 12 performance, Watson briefly became the NFL's all-time regular-season career passer-rating leader before being surpassed five days later by Patrick Mahomes.[116] Watson was fined $7,500 by the Texans in December 2020 for violating the league's COVID-19 protocols after he and several teammates gathered at the opening of his new restaurant without wearing face masks.[117] Watson finished the season with a pair of three-touchdown performances against the Bengals in Week 16[118] and the Titans in Week 18, but Houston lost both games.[119] In spite of the team's 4-12 record, Watson finished the 2020 season with a league-leading 4,823 passing yards, as well as 33 touchdowns to only seven interceptions.[120] His season was, by all major statistical measures, the best in franchise history, leading in passing touchdowns, passing yards and passer rating.[121] He became the first player to lead the league in passing yards on a team with at least 12 losses since Jeff George of the Oakland Raiders in 1997.[122] Following the 2020 season, Watson requested a trade by the Texans after becoming disgruntled with changes in the front office and coaching staff.[123] The Texans were not willing to negotiate with other teams regarding trade offers, leading to a standoff with Watson until the emergence of sexual-harassment allegations. Despite the off-field controversies and Watson's situation with the team, he participated in OTA activities and training camp, albeit on a limited basis.[124] Watson was named to the Texans' 53-man roster to start the season along with free-agent signing Tyrod Taylor and rookie Davis Mills. Texans general manager Nick Caserio stated that he would handle Watson's situation \"one day at a time.\"[125] Despite not being officially suspended or placed on any reserve list, Watson was ruled out for every Texans game played in 2021 for \"non-injury reasons/personal matter.\"[126] On March 18, 2022, Watson and the Texans' 2024 sixth-round draft pick were traded to the Browns in exchange for the Browns' first-round draft picks in 2022, 2023, and 2024, as well as the Browns' third-round pick in 2023 and fourth-round picks in 2022 and 2024.[127][128] As part of the trade, Watson signed a new, fully guaranteed, five-year, $230 million deal with the Browns, making it the largest contract and most guaranteed money in NFL history.[129] As a result of his sexual harassment allegations, Watson was suspended for six regular season games to start the 2022 season by arbiter Sue Lewis Robinson.[130] He was allowed to participate in preseason activities, including preseason games.[131] Two days later the NFL filed an appeal of the suspension, seeking to extend the suspension to at least a full season (17 regular season games), as well as seeking a fine and establishing a clause in which Watson would seek treatment for his conduct.[132] NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell confirmed that the NFL would seek a full-year suspension including the postseason, calling Watson's conduct \"egregious\" and \"predatory behavior\".[133] The appeal was reviewed by former New Jersey Attorney General Peter C. Harvey.[134][135] On August 18, 2022, after the NFL and the NFLPA reached a settlement, Watson was suspended for the first 11 games of the 2022 regular season and was fined $5 million.[136] On November 28, 2022, Watson was reinstated from his suspension and was officially added to the 53-man roster.[137] In Week 13, Watson started against his former team, the Texans. In his first game in 700 days, Watson posted the worst passer rating of his NFL career at 53.4, throwing for 131 yards and one interception in the 27–14 win.[138] Watson finished the 2022 season with a 3–3 record as starting quarterback, with 1,102 passing yards, 7 touchdowns, and 5 interceptions as he closed out the last six games of the season.[139] The Browns finished with a 7–10 record, and Watson's passer rating of 79.1 for the season was the lowest of his career.[140] In week 10 against the Baltimore Ravens, Watson suffered a displaced fracture to the glenoid in his right shoulder during the first half, but he was able to finish the game. Three days later, on November 15, the Browns announced that Watson would undergo season-ending surgery to repair a broken bone in his throwing shoulder.[141] Watson finished the season starting in six games, finishing with seven touchdowns and four interceptions and 1,115 passing yards.[142] Watson underwent surgery on November 21, with the expectation to be fully recovered before the 2024 NFL season.[143] In Week 1 against the Cowboys, Watson threw for 169 yards, one touchdown, two interceptions, and was sacked six times in a 33–17 loss.[144] Watson was also 0-for-10 on passes thrown 15+ yards downfield, becoming the first quarterback to have 10+ passes thrown 15 or more yards downfield with zero completions since Sportradar began tracking air yards in 2006.[145] Through five games, Watson posted a league-low 23.9 total QBR and failed to achieve over 200 passing yards in a game as the Browns dropped to 1–4. Despite the struggles, head coach Kevin Stefanski stated that Watson would continue to start for Cleveland.[146] On October 20, during the Browns' Week 7 matchup against the Cincinnati Bengals, Watson was carted off the field after suffering a non-contact leg injury.[147] The following day, it was confirmed to be an Achilles tear, which forced him to miss the rest of the 2024 season.[148] Watson underwent Achilles surgery on October 25.[149] With Watson at quarterback, the Browns went 1–6 and ranked last in the NFL with 253.9 yards of offense per game.[150] On January 9, 2025, Watson underwent surgery after he suffered a re-rupture to his right Achilles tendon, potentially keeping him out for the entire 2025 season.[151] On March 16, 2021, a Houston massage therapist filed a civil lawsuit delivered by attorney Tony Buzbee against Watson, claiming that Watson had touched her with the tip of his erect penis while asking her for sex during a visit to her home for treatment in March 2020. Watson vehemently denied Buzbee's claims, stating that \"I have never treated any woman with anything other than the utmost respect.\" According to the suit, the massage therapist immediately ended the session and cried after the incident. Two additional NFL players contacted the massage therapist several weeks later on Watson's recommendation. The suit also claims that Watson later reached out to the massage therapist and apologized for his actions.[152] The next day, another massage therapist represented by Buzbee claimed that Watson had met her at the Houstonian Hotel in August 2020 and completely undressed and refused to cover up, directing her to massage his anus and penis and making a movement that caused her to touch his penis. The therapist also claims that Watson had only paid half of the charges due for her services.[153] On March 18, a third civil lawsuit was filed against Watson, alleging that he had forced a massage therapist to perform oral sex on him before she blacked out in an office building in December 2020. The therapist claims that after Watson left, she was shaken and defecated on herself. Also, on March 18, the NFL announced that it would investigate the sexual assault allegations made against Watson.[154] On March 19, Buzbee claimed that nine more civil suits had been filed against Watson (for a total of 12) and that 22 women contacted his office regarding Watson's conduct while receiving massages. Buzbee requested that the Houston Police Department and the Harris County, Texas, district attorney investigate the situation and pursue criminal charges against Watson. One of the nine new civil suits alleges that Watson attempted to kiss a woman forcibly, and another suit alleges that he had attempted to assault the same woman on two separate occasions.[155] On March 22, a 14th lawsuit was filed by a woman who called Watson a \"serial predator\". The incident allegedly occurred in California, just the second of the 14 allegations to occur outside the Houston area. The traveling massage therapist alleged that when she arrived at the address that Watson had provided, he led her to a room and \"locked the doors behind him\". After Watson allegedly \"forced Plaintiff's hand onto his penis\" during the massage, he allegedly told her, \"I will not have you sign an NDA, but don't ever talk about this.\" The plaintiff also alleges that Watson reached out on Instagram in December, \"acting as if nothing had happened\".[156] By April 5, 22 lawsuits were filed against Watson.[157] 18 professional massage therapists have since expressed support of his character, saying that the allegations contradict their experiences with Watson.[158] Tony Buzbee has stated that he was hesitant to send evidence to the Houston Police Department because Watson's lawyer Rusty Hardin has a son in the police force, instead alleging to send evidence from his clients \"elsewhere\" while also criticizing outgoing HPD chief Art Acevedo.[159] Hardin and Acevedo have since criticized Buzbee's statements, with Hardin saying that he and his client would \"always remain available to any law enforcement or regulatory agency who desires our cooperation\".[160][161] On April 2, the HPD announced an investigation of Watson after a complainant filed an official report.[162] On April 6, two of the 22 women who had filed lawsuits against Watson publicly identified themselves at a press conference.[162] Ashley Solis, the first of the women to identify herself, claimed that during a massage appointment at her home, Watson exposed himself and touched her hand with his erect penis before she ended the session and asked him to leave. At a press conference, Solis said that she suffers from panic attacks, anxiety and depression resulting from the sexual assault. She stated: \"People say that I'm doing this just for money. That is false. I come forward now so that Deshaun Watson does not assault another woman.\"[163] On April 9, Hardin claimed that some of Watson's massages did lead to some \"sexual activity\" but that it was consensual.[164] That same day, two judges ruled that 13 of the 22 lawsuits must be refiled within two business days or risk dismissal and that four of the accusers must refile using their current names. Attorneys announced that 9 of the 12 women would reveal their names voluntarily. The judge granted Watson's attorneys' emergency motion requiring the release of the other accusers' names.[165][166][167] On September 9, 2024, Watson was sued for sexual assault and battery by a new accuser in Houston, who alleged that Watson penetrated her vagina without consent in several positions during a date in 2020.[168] On April 7, 2021, Nike and Beats By Dre suspended endorsement deals with Watson. Reliant Energy and H-E-B stated that they did not plan on engaging with Watson in the future.[169] On March 11, 2022, a grand jury declined to indict Watson on criminal charges related to \"harassment and sexual misconduct\". On that date he still faced 22 civil lawsuits, many alleging sexual misconduct, and assault.[170] As of August 1, 2022, all but one of the pending civil cases had been settled.[171] As a result of these accusations, the NFL announced on August 18, 2022, that Watson would be suspended for 11 games, pay a record $5 million fine, undergo evaluation by behavioral experts, and complete a treatment program. His fine and an additional $2 million will be donated to agencies that work to prevent sexual assault.[172] Watson is a Christian.[181][182] In 2006, when Watson was 11, Atlanta Falcons running back Warrick Dunn donated a home to Watson's family through Dunn's charity Homes for the Holidays, in partnership with Habitat for Humanity.[183] In 2017, Watson donated his first NFL game check of approximately $27,000 to three NRG Stadium cafeteria employees affected by Hurricane Harvey.[184][185]",

Look for further details regarding Watson's estimated recovery timeline to emerge in the coming days and weeks, but the Browns figure to fortify their depth at the quarterback position this offseason, via free agency, trade or through the 2025 NFL Draft in which Cleveland holds the No. 2 overall selection. ESPN Fantasy Projection: Watson is set for his third season in Cleveland and seventh overall as a pro. A 2022 suspension and a shoulder injury last season have limited Watson to only 12 starts with the Browns, in which he has averaged just 14.4 points per game and completed 59.8% of his passes. The team traded for WR Jerry Jeudy this offseason to bolster the pass game opposite Amari Cooper and David Njoku in Kevin Stefanski's quarterback-friendly offense. However, while Watson was playing at a scheme-transcendent level earlier in his career with the Texans, his lack of availability and declining production in Cleveland creates concern and drops his fantasy value into the QB2 range.",

The Buckeyes countered by landing former Kansas State quarterback Will Howard, a decision that seemed to benefit both the school and team. With Howard, a fifth-year senior, leading the offense, Ohio State won 10 regular season games, followed by two College Football Playoff games to enter the semifinals. Howard turned out to be the perfect player to help head coach Ryan Day, new offensive coordinator Chip Kelly, and star freshman wide receiver Jeremiah Smith. The Sporting News examines why Will Howard chose to join the Buckeyes. SN's PLAYOFF HQ: Live CFP scores | Updated CFP bracket | Full CFP schedule Howard started for Kansas State in 2022 and 2023 but chose enter the portal as a graduate transfer following the 2023 season. When Howard transferred from Kansas State to Ohio State, he did so with a title in mind. The fifth-year senior chose the Buckeyes in large part due to their path to winning the National Championship. \"When I started talking to Ohio State, everything kind of lined up,\" Howard said last year, via ESPN's Pete Thamel. \"I had a list of things I was looking for, in terms of needing to go somewhere where there was a lot of talent around me and somewhere I could compete for a national championship.\" With that goal in mind, Howard certainly made a strong choice, as Ohio State is now one of four teams left with a chance to win the National Championship. Kansas State, meanwhile, finished at a respectable 9-4 on the season for the second-straight year, but it wasn't good enough for the Playoff. However, that's not the only reason Howard is now at Ohio State, as the quarterback also believes this team gives him the best chance to make it in the NFL. \"At the end of the day, I want to go be a starting quarterback in the NFL,\" Howard added. \"I feel like the best place to stick as a quarterback in the NFL is as a first- or second-round pick in the NFL draft. Going to Ohio State gives me a chance to make a jump and leap into that conversation.\" It is still too early to tell whether Ohio State helped Howard get into the first or second round of the NFL draft, just like the team helped him play for a title. COLLEGE FOOTBALL AWARDS After a tough freshman season, and a quiet sophomore year, Howard improved in each of the past three seasons, culminating in this year's breakout performance for the Buckeyes. Howard led the Big Ten in touchdown passes and set career-highs across the board while playing for the explosive Ohio State offense. Howard is the seventh-ranked quarterback in this year's NFL draft according to the NFL Mock Draft Database, which puts him as a Day-3 pick. This season should help Howard's stock, as the Buckeyes quarterback put up career-best numbers in multiple areas. Additionally, he played on the biggest stage with one of the biggest brands in the country and most recently led the Buckeyes' to a blowout over the then-undefeated Oregon powerhouse.

                "content": "Wildfires that have devastated parts of Los Angeles over the past few days are continuing to rage around the city's northern and western suburbs, with the Los Angeles medical examiner on Thursday confirming that 10 people have died since the infernos broke out on Tuesday. At least 10,000 properties have been destroyed across the city according to authorities, with AccuWeather's chief meteorologist Jonathan Porter describing the blazes as \"one of the costliest wildfire disasters in modern U.S. history.\" On Thursday the Los Angeles Police Department apprehended a suspect shortly after 4:30 p.m. PT after they were allegedly seen trying to light a fire in Woodland Hills, at the 21700 block of Ybarra Road. Speaking to Newsweek Izzy Gardon, communications director for California Governor Gavin Newsom, said: \"The Governor is focused on protecting people, not playing politics, and making sure firefighters have all the resources they need.\" As of 3:15 a.m. ET Friday, a map produced by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) showed they were battling four main wildfires on the northern and western outskirts of Los Angeles. The CAL FIRE map showed that the largest blaze by some margin remained the Palisades fire, which has consumed 19,978 acres in an area to the immediate west of Santa Monica, an increase from 15,800 acres on Thursday morning. At 3:15 a.m. ET Friday, the Palisades fire, which erupted on Tuesday, was only 6 percent contained. Its cause is under investigation. Evacuation shelters have been set up at the Westwood Recreation Center on 1350 South Sepulveda Boulevard, the El Camino Real Charter High School at 5440 Valley Circle Boulevard and the Pasadena Convention Center on 300 E Green Street. The Kenneth fire, which has burned across 1,000 acres to the north of Calabasas, is the newest of the major fires, first being recorded at 3:34 p.m. Thursday according to CAL FIRE. The inferno was 35 percent contained as of 3:15 a.m. ET Friday. CAL FIRE said: \"The Kenneth Fire is burning in West Hills in Los Angeles County and rapidly spreading. \"Fanned by strong Santa Ana winds, the fire threatens nearby communities and infrastructure, prompting swift evacuation orders. Firefighters from Los Angeles and Ventura counties are actively engaged in containment efforts, deploying both ground crews and aerial resources. The challenging terrain and persistent winds complicate suppression activities.\" The Hurst fire, which began on Tuesday, had burned over 771 acres as of early Friday morning, and had been 37 percent contained. The blaze is situated to the north of San Fernando. An evacuation order had been in place for much of the local area, but this was lifted at 3 p.m. PT Thursday. Ritchie Valens Recreation Center, on 10736 Laurel Canyon Blvd., has been turned into an evacuation shelter for those impacted by the Hurst fire. Large animal shelters are also available at the Los Angeles Equestrian Center, Industry Hills Expo, Pomona Fairplex and Castaic Animal Care Center. The Eaton fire had burned through 13,690 acres to the north of Pasadena as of early Friday morning, up from an estimated 10,600 acres the previous morning. Command over the containment operation is being led by the Los Angeles County Fire Department, Pasadena Fire and the United States Forest Services. According to CAL FIRE the blaze began on Tuesday evening and its cause is still being investigated. CAL FIRE said: \"Firefighters are working aggressively to slow the spread and protect critical infrastructure under extreme conditions. Multiple structures have been damaged or destroyed as the wind-driven brush fire continues... \"The combination of low humidity, dry fuels, and shifting winds has heightened the potential for spot fires and rapid expansion.\" Evacuation orders remain in place for a number of areas, meaning there is a lawful order to leave immediately. These are situated north of Orange Grove/Rosemead Boulevard, east of Lake Avenue, and west of Michillinda Avenue. The Arcadia Community Center, El Camino Real Charter High School, Pasadena Convention Center, Pomona Fairplex and Westwood Recreation Center have all been turned into evacuation shelters. As of 10:45 a.m. ET Friday, the following evacuation orders remain in place for the following zones: Evacuation orders are in place for DRY-U026-A, LOS-Q0767, MAL-C111-A, MAL-C111-B, MAL-C112-B, MTN-U028, RMB-U030-A, RMB-U030-B, RMB-U030-D, RMB-U030-E, RRC-U027, SAN-Q1388-B, SAN-Q1395-B, SAN-Q1396-B, SDP-U029, SSM-U010-A, SSM-U010-B, TOP-U001, TOP-U002, TOP-U003, TOP-U004, TOP-U005, TOP-U006, TOP-U007, TOP-U008 and TOP-U009.

                "title": "Kenneth Fire Map, Updates as Los Angeles Threatened by New Blaze - Newsweek",
                "content": "A new wildfire has erupted in Los Angeles as the emergency services continue to tackle blazes across the city. The Kenneth Fire is believed to have been started intentionally, and a suspect is in custody, per the Los Angeles Police Department. Wildfires, spread by powerful Santa Ana winds, are engulfing much of Los Angeles. Known for their hot, dry nature, Santa Ana winds sap moisture from vegetation, leaving grasses, shrubs and trees highly combustible. Under such conditions, any spark—whether from downed power lines, machinery or natural events such as lightning—can ignite an inferno, with containment efforts significantly hindered by the winds' ferocity. So far, at least 10 people have been killed as a result of the wildfires, the County of Los Angeles Department of Medical Examiner said Thursday evening. Meanwhile, nearly 180,000 people are under evacuation orders as a result of the fires. The Kenneth Fire began at around 3:30 p.m. local time on Thursday in Woodland Hills and it has burned across almost 1,000 acres, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department. Authorities shut down a portion of Highway 101 in response. While the fire grew quickly in just a couple hours, it is now spreading more slowly, CNN reported. So far, it has been 35 percent contained. More than 60 fire companies were sent to respond to the blaze, Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley said. Authorities believe the fire was started intentionally. In a 4:30 p.m. radio call, \"a male was heard stating a suspect was attempting to light a fire\" in Woodland Hills, at the 21700 block of Ybarra Road in Los Angeles, an LAPD official told Newsweek. The call came about two hours after the Kenneth wildfire was first reported. Police added that officers arrived and apprehended a suspect. Meanwhile, Los Angeles County Supervisor Janice Hahn was forced to apologise in a post on X after millions of residents across the greater Los Angeles area mistakenly received an evacuation warning alert on their phones late Thursday afternoon local time that was meant for the areas impacted by the Kenneth Fire. \"It was meant to be for the areas impacted by the Kenneth Fire in Woodland Hills,\" Hahn said. Officials quickly worked to correct the notice, which had indicated that recipients should be ready to leave their area immediately if called upon due to surrounding wildfires. Hahn said many had received the alerts by mistake \"due to a technical error.\" It comes as at least four other fires are burning in the city. Those include the Palisades Fire, which has burned across at least 19,978 acres and has been 6 percent contained, the Hurst Fire, which has burned at least 771 acres and has been 37 percent contained, and the Lidia Fire, which has burned at least 394 acres and has been 75 percent contained. The Eaton Fire has burned 13,690 acres, with zero containment as of Friday. Containment numbers should go up as weather conditions improve, according to Capt. Adam VanGerpen, spokesperson for the Los Angeles Fire Department. \"We have about 2,300 firefighters just at the Palisades Fire ... we have firefighters coming in from all over the state,\" he told CNN. At least 10 people have been killed as a result of the wildfires and that number could rise as the blazes spread, with no sign of an ending in sight. Nearly 180,000 people are under evacuation orders as a result of the fires, which have caused a huge amount of damage to property and possessions, disrupting the normal operation of the city and hurting the local economy. Cal Fire wrote on its website: \"Fanned by strong Santa Ana winds, the fire threatens nearby communities and infrastructure, prompting swift evacuation orders. Firefighters from Los Angeles and Ventura counties are actively engaged in containment efforts, deploying both ground crews and aerial resources.\" Fire crews are continuing to fight the wildfires. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said residents should continue to heed emergency orders from the Los Angeles Fire Department and first responders.

On Thursday afternoon, the Kenneth Fire started in the San Fernando Valley. It moved into neighboring Ventura County, but a large and aggressive response by firefighters stopped the flames from spreading. The fires have burned more than 10,000 homes and other structures since Tuesday, when they first began popping up around a densely populated, 25-mile (40-kilometer) expanse north of downtown Los Angeles. No cause has been identified yet for the largest fires. Here's the latest:Red flag warning set to expire Los Angeles Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said the current red flag warning will expire at 6 p.m. Pacific on Friday but a new warning is expected to be issued Monday, when windy conditions in the Los Angeles area are forecast to return. Lakers’ head coach confirms his family lost their home in the Palisades fire Los Angeles Lakers head coach JJ Redick became emotional when he spoke about the fire’s impact for the first time on Friday after practice with the Lakers, who are currently scheduled to return to action Saturday against San Antonio. “I’m not sure I’ve wept or wailed like that in several years,” Redick said. Redick said the rented home in Pacific Palisades burned down Tuesday while the Lakers were on the road in Dallas. Redick’s wife, Chelsea, and their two sons were safely away from the neighborhood. Firefighters from Mexico will help fight the Eaton Fire, Newsom says “California is deeply grateful for President @ClaudiaShein’s support as we work to suppress the Los Angeles wildfires,” he wrote on Friday in a post on the social platform X. “Our partnership and shared commitment to helping communities in need is greatly valued.” Newsom orders investigation of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered the investigation over the loss of water pressure as firefighters struggled to contain multiple, fierce fires that burned down neighborhoods across the Los Angeles area. “We need answers to how that happened,” Newsom said in a statement, calling ongoing reports of the lack of water “deeply troubling.” A public update on the Eaton Fire is expected Friday afternoon Los Angeles County officials will hold a news conference at 1 p.m. Pacific Time to provide an update on the Eaton Fire in the Pasadena area. County Supervisor Kathryn Barger will be joined by fire and law enforcement officials. Other ways to help those affected by the wildfires Several organizations are also helping support animals and pet owners impacted by the Los Angeles wildfires, including: 1. Pasadena Humane Society: The animal rescue had taken in over 300 animals due to evacuations as of Wednesday night, including some with burns and injuries. Its officers are also on the ground finding animals that need help. It is accepting monetary donations as well as goods from its Amazon wishlist. Other organizations are focused on long-term recovery efforts, including: 2. California Community Foundation: The 110-year-old Los Angeles-based foundation’s Wildfire Recovery Fund addresses long-term recovery needs like temporary housing, rebuilding homes, mental health and medical care. It also provides updated equipment to firefighters and helps rebuild emergency communications systems. It is accepting cash donations and helps company-match employees’ gifts as well. 3. Team Rubicon and Samaritan’s Purse: Both organizations will help people who lost homes with debris removal once cleanup begins, among other work related to rebuilding. Team Rubicon is currently helping local agencies with tasks like clearing roads and Samaritan’s Purse has deployed 20 chaplains from the Billy Graham Rapid Response Team to provide spiritual support. Archer Fire evacuation order downgraded The Los Angeles Fire Department has downgraded the evacuation order for a fire in the Granada Hills area to an evacuation warning. The department puts the Archer Fire at 31 acres (13 hectares). Los Angeles fires leave congregants without worship spaces Flames were already attacking the campus of Pasadena Jewish Temple and Center when the cantor, Ruth Berman Harris, and three companions rushed in to rescue its sacred Torah scrolls. Physically, that’s now all that is left of the 80-year-old synagogue, destroyed by wildfires that also destroyed a mosque, a Catholic parish and a half-dozen Protestant churches. Many members of these congregations were among the thousands of Angelenos who lost their homes this week. As the threat of new fires persisted, clergy were left with the huge challenges of offering comfort and pondering paths toward rebuilding and recovery. “There’s absolutely nothing except for a few walls and the empty space,” said the Pasadena Jewish Center’s executive director, Melissa Levy. How to help people you know who are affected by the fires Friends and family who lost property may need cash, temporary housing, or emotional support. But it’s important to reach out delicately and to not have expectations for how or whether they will respond, said Dr. Adrienne Heinz, a clinical research psychologist at the Department of Veterans Affairs National Center for PTSD. Here are some tips she has: It can be helpful to check in. An example: “I’m so sorry for what has happened to your community. There aren’t really words to describe how sad this is. Can I send your family a meal tonight? I’m here for you and will keep checking in. No pressure to respond.” Offer concrete ways of helping like lodging, gift cards, meals, child care. Give them grace. They may not be able to respond for various reasons. Refrain from phrases that minimize or invalidate their experience, like “At least you’re alive,” or “Everything happens for a reason.” Just because someone didn’t lose their home, doesn’t mean they aren’t hurting. Officials expect to downgrade new evacuation order soon Margaret Stewart, a spokeswoman with the Los Angeles Fire Department, said firefighters on the ground and in the air were able to tackle the Archer Fire quickly and that the evacuation order is expected to be downgraded soon. “We still have some winds and that’s why we have not yet lifted the evacuation order,” Stewart told KTLA. The brush fire sparked in the Granada Hills area. New evacuation order issued The Los Angeles Fire Department issued an evacuation order on Friday due to a brush fire in the Granada Hills area. The area is just west of the Hurst Fire. How to help firefighters and other first responders Firefighters have spent the past few days battling major fires across the Los Angeles area with fierce winds hampering their efforts. Here are a couple of organizations that are working to support firefighters, first responders, and their families. California Fire Foundation: California Professional Firefighters founded the nonprofit in 1987 to support families of fallen firefighters, firefighters and communities impacted by fires. The foundation is supporting both firefighters responding to the Los Angeles fires as well as people affected. Watch Duty: The nonprofit service provides real-time updates on wildfire activity, evacuations, shelters and more via its free app, which more than 1.4 million people downloaded in the 48 hours since the fires began. The organization relies on donations and a team of 200 volunteers, gathering and vetting information from radio scanners and official sources, to do its work. The Biden administration is working with Trump’s team on the fires “They know every single thing we’re doing about this response,” President Joe Biden said on Friday. However, Biden took a shot at President-elect Donald Trump, who he referred to as “someone from the other team,” by mocking his call to sweep the forest floors to reduce fire dangers. “C’mon man,” he said. Biden said it would be a better idea to bury electricity transmission wires, which would be “a hell of a lot safer” but would cost “a hell of a lot of money” to do. Biden says looting during the wildfires is a problem “There’s clear evidence that there’s looting,” he said at the briefing. Biden said that’s why they’ve deployed police and National Guard to improve security in the areas affected by the wildfires. Biden defends LA mayor over criticism about water supplies “I know you’re getting a bad rap regarding fire hydrants that aren’t working,” he said to Mayor Karen Bass during the briefing on Friday. “Give me a break.” Biden pegged the problem to utilities cutting power because they’re worried about sparking more fires, which has hampered the ability to pump water. “This is complicated stuff, and you’re going to have a lot of demagogues out there trying to take advantage of it.” Bass appeared virtually at the briefing alongside California Gov. Gavin Newsom. Newsom: ‘We’ve got to deal with this misinformation’ around handling of the fires During the Oval Office briefing, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said he expects firefighters to “make a lot of progress” on Friday. Local leaders have faced sharp criticism for their handling of the fires, some of it coming from right-wing sources. Newsom said, “We’ve got to deal with this misinformation.” “People want to divide this country and we’re going to have to address this as well,” he added. Biden and Harris convene for wildfire briefing President Joe Biden hosted a briefing on the wildfires in the Oval Office on Friday. Vice President Kamala Harris was also there, and California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass appeared virtually. Biden described the fires as the “worst in California history” and “we still got a long way to go.” Although progress has been made, the winds that have fanned the flames could remain a threat for days. Harris said people responding to the fires are showing “the best of the American spirit.” “There are moments where we should find optimism in the heroism of people, who are taking in strangers, taking in friends,” she said. Several reptiles die after Eaton Canyon Nature Center burns down “The nature center is gone ... the wildflowers, the shrubs are gone,” said Richard Smart, Superintendent of the Eaton Canyon Natural Area in Pasadena, in an interview on Thursday. He said that only a few exterior walls of the Eaton Canyon Nature Center were left standing after wildfires tore through the area. The nature center burned down before, in 1993, and did not reopen until 1997. “The park is such a touchstone for people in the community, and so to lose that is just — devastating is not even the right word. It feels indescribable,” he said. Staffers were unable to reach the center in time to evacuate the animals. Around 15 reptiles died. Two desert tortoises survived because they were hibernating for the winter at a volunteer’s home. The park has over 150 volunteers, many of whom have lost their homes. Here is where containment of the fires currently stands The causes of the fires are still under investigation. ‘We’re getting Los Angeles prepared,’ Bass says of next week’s forecast A reporter pointed out there is a forecast for strong winds to return to the LA area next week and people may deactivate the alerts because of the frustration with all the false alarms. “We know that we’re going to have a possible increase in the force of the winds at the beginning of next week and we’re getting Los Angeles prepared, doing everything we can to save lives, that is our number one job to protect people’s homes, to protect people’s businesses and to prepare to rebuild Los Angeles in a much better way,” she said. Bass focuses on recovery and uniting Angelenos When questioned about the false alerts that have been going on Mayor Karen Bass said officials are working to figure out why that is happening and turned to a message of uniting Angelenos. “I’m going to spend every moment that I can making sure that I’m in as many areas as possible, meeting and talking to residents to see what is needed in the recovery,” Bass said. “We’re moving at recovery mode at the same time, meaning, we want the city rebuilt. We want to see Los Angeles come together,” she added. ‘Looting is a despicable crime’ Los Angeles District Attorney Nathan Hochman said he would prosecute anyone looting, those flying drones in the wildfire zones, and those breaking the curfew “to the full extent of the law.” “Looting is a despicable crime,” he said. “For the people who have already been arrested, please know this is not going to end well.” Curfew to resume Friday night Los Angeles Sheriff Robert Luna said a curfew on all mandatory evacuation zones will start again at 6 p.m. Friday for houses left standing. Officials imposed a curfew overnight after arresting several people looting in the burned areas. “You can’t not be in these affected areas. If you are, you are subject to arrest,” he said. Some evacuation orders and warnings have been lifted Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley said all evacuation orders and warnings in LA County for the Kenneth Fire have been lifted. Overall evacuation orders have dipped to 153,000 from more than 180,000. Damaged super scooper will be back in the air next week, county fire chief says Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Perrone said the super scooper that was damaged by a drone should be back in the air by Monday. “Flying a drone in the fire traffic area is not only dangerous but it’s illegal,” he said, adding that those who fly them over the wildfire area will be prosecuted. Mayor Bass: ‘To all Angelenos, we’re fighting hard for each of you’ Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said officials are working around the clock and that firefighters have extinguished fires in Pacoima, Hollywood, Studio City and other places. “To all Angelenos, we’re fighting hard for each of you,” she said. “I don’t believe there is anything Angelenos can’t do if we stand together,” she added. Officials apologize for erroneous emergency messages “There is an extreme amount of frustration, anger, fear with regards to the erroneous messages that have been sent out through the wireless emergency Alert System across L.A County. I can’t express enough how sorry I am for this experience,” L.A. County Office of Emergency Management Director Kevin McGowan said at a news conference on Friday. McGowan said the alerts are not being sent by a person and his office is trying to find the root cause. How to help people displaced by the wildfires Several organizations are working to support people, families and households affected by the wildfires in the Los Angeles area. Among those are: GoFundMe.org: The crowdfunding platform’s nonprofit arm uses its Wildfire Recovery Fund to give emergency grants to verified people and families fundraising for themselves or others, as well as small businesses and nonprofits. Global Empowerment Mission (GEM) and BStrong: In partnership with Bethenny Frankel’s bstrong disaster relief fund, GEM will distribute cash cards to evacuated residents to help with immediate needs like accommodation, gas and food. The organizations are accepting cash donations. Los Angeles Regional Food Bank: The food bank is supporting a network of more than 600 partner agencies to make sure impacted households are fed. It’s accepting cash donations, food donations at two sites, and volunteers. If your household needs assistance, you can find a food bank here. How to help children affected by the wildfires Major fires across the Los Angeles area this week have killed at least 10 people, destroyed thousands of structures and forced 180,000 to flee their homes — including children. Here are a couple of organizations accepting support specifically for kids and families: Project Camp: The Los Angeles-based organization runs trauma-informed pop-up day camps for children displaced or out of school due to natural disasters. It’s in the process of setting up multiple sites to help families impacted by the Palisades and Eaton fires. It is accepting monetary donations as well as volunteers to staff the camps. Impacted families can also find out how to sign up for a camp here. Boys and Girls Clubs of Malibu: Informed by its experience helping kids and families after the 2018 Woolsey fire, the organization is offering free counseling, case management and resource referrals for area families. It’s collecting donations to provide emergency grants and, when its facilities can safely reopen, it will create an emergency relief distribution center. Those looking for help can fill out intake forms in English and Spanish. Drone collision grounds firefighting plane A firefighting plane had to be grounded Thursday after it was struck by a drone flown by a civilian, the Los Angeles County Fire Department said. Nobody was injured. It’s a federal crime to fly a drone during firefighting. Some journalists covering the fires have lost their homes to them NBC News reporter Jacob Soboroff didn’t know what to expect when he turned his SUV onto the Pacific Palisades street where he grew up. What he found on Wednesday were smoldering ruins where his childhood home had stood. Only the remnants of a chimney and brick wall remained. It was among the countless number of buildings destroyed by the wildfires in the Los Angeles area, where Soboroff is one of many journalists covering the story — and living it. His own tale, told across several NBC News platforms Wednesday and Thursday, broke the so-called “fourth wall” and gave viewers an intimate experience of what the tragedy felt like. National Guard troops on the ground in Altadena National Guard troops were patrolling the streets of Altadena before dawn on Friday after being called in to help protect property in the fire evacuation zone. Troops in camouflage were posted at intersections in the city hard-hit by the Eaton Fire near Jeeps, Humvees and other military vehicles. At least 20 arrests have been made for looting and other thefts in areas where the fire raged. Los Angeles County officials say they plan to put an overnight curfew in place that would make it easier to make arrests. Australia ‘stands ready to provide support’ to help battle Los Angeles blazes “We haven’t had any requests for further support. But Australia always stands ready to provide support to our friends in times of need,” Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese Albanese told Australian Broadcasting Corp. in the west coast city of Perth on Friday. “One of the issues that we have, of course, is we do need to be cognizant of the fact that this is our fire season as well,” he added. The California fires come at the peak of Australia’s fire season. Earth records its hottest year ever in 2024 Earth recorded its hottest year ever in 2024, with such a big jump that the planet temporarily passed a major climate threshold, several weather monitoring agencies announced on Friday. Last year’s global average temperature easily passed 2023’s record heat and kept pushing even higher. It surpassed the long-term warming limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit ) since the late 1800s that was called for by the 2015 Paris climate pact, according to the European Commission’s Copernicus Climate Service, the United Kingdom’s Meteorology Office and Japan’s weather agency. The European team calculated 1.6 degrees Celsius (2.89 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming. Japan found 1.57 degrees Celsius (2.83 degrees Fahrenheit) and the British 1.53 degrees Celsius (2.75 degrees Fahrenheit) in releases of data coordinated to early Friday morning European time. What ignited the deadly California wildfires? Investigators consider an array of possibilities Investigators are considering an array of possible ignition sources for the huge fires that have killed at least 10 people and destroyed thousands of homes and businesses in the Los Angeles area. While lightning is the most common source of fires in the U.S., according to the National Fire Protection Association, investigators were able to rule that out quickly. There were no reports of lightning in the Palisades area or the terrain around the Eaton fire, which started in east Los Angeles County and has also destroyed hundreds of homes. The next two most common causes: fires intentionally set, and those sparked by utility lines.",

                "title": "Ryan Day should take matters into his own hands, exit Ohio State no matter College Football Playoff outcome - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Ryan Day isn't known for his flair. The Ohio State coach could double nicely as a mattress salesman, local TV ads and all that. He'd blend into the background. That's why it hurts so much to watch what's happened to him. He deserves better. Sure, he's a millionaire many times over and has the Buckeyes on the cusp of a College Football Playoff National Championship appearance. Ohio State might have the best roster left in the field, which is reflected by the Buckeyes becoming the betting favorite to win the whole thing. Day also looks like he's coaching angry. He's had enough -- of the fans, of the blame, of what the job has become. Day has that look because he has in his pocket what might be called the ultimate \"F--you\" card. For those with certain sensibilities, we mean \"Forget you.\" That is, forget you who have doubted him. Call this more advice than hope. Whenever this Ohio State season ends, win or lose in this chase for the school's first national championship in 10 years, Day should get up at the postgame podium and check out. He should thank everyone before politely stepping down from his post as Ohio State's coach. If he wasn't such a decent guy, I could envision Day at least considering what Bobby Knight said out loud for his walk off. It would be his choice, thankfully, to control the climate for once at Ohio State. In another more succinct sense, it would be a middle finger to what the job has become at times. Different people are motivated by different things. For Day, it is unjust criticism from his own people. If Day waves goodbye, it wouldn't really matter what's next because the man has proven himself. He also has 20 years or so left in his coaching career. The NFL would be a fine option. There are several openings currently, and Day is more than qualified having two years in the league as an assistant. He could do TV for a year or two. Hey, linear cable needs mattress salesmen, too. Point is, Day wouldn't be out of work for long. He would be free. Free of how tiring the routine has become. The latest Michigan loss was, is and always will be a debacle. Nothing can change that. Everything, everywhere all at once went bad in a 13-10 loss. That result will still stink -- to some -- like week-old fish. It will stink even more if Day loses a fifth consecutive game to Michigan next season. A playoff run should mitigate those kinds of losses. Ask Penn State's James Franklin, who goes into the Notre Dame game 1-18 against top-five teams. In this discussion, there is a fundamental difference in the two fanbases. Up North, they stuck with Jim Harbaugh through his ninth year until things fully turned around. They stayed loyal to Harbs through dalliances with the NFL and multiple NCAA investigations. Day -- never a head coach before -- followed Urban Meyer and immediately started kicking ass. Now, Day can't win by enough. The Michigan obsession has become malignant. Maybe it's a sense of entitlement by the fans that maybe shouldn't be there. Until 2014, Ohio State had won one title since 1968. Meyer was the architect 10 years ago. He has a room in his restaurant named after his record against Michigan, \"7-0\". Meanwhile, Day -- the winningest coach in the FBS (.872) -- is being compared to John Cooper. Sometimes, you don't know what you've got until it's gone. Sometimes, perspective only sees as far as the end of the corner bar. Boston College's Jeff Hafley got out ahead of the posse. Day's own offensive coordinator, Chip Kelly, similarly gave up a head coaching job at UCLA. That's why Day might need an exit strategy. On his terms. This is becoming a quality of life thing. After the latest Michigan loss, Day got a vote of confidence from his athletic director (Ross Bjork). It was Day's 10th career loss. He lost two this season by a total of four points and avenged one of them. Lane Kiffin lost three times this season, including one at home to 4-8 Kentucky. The difference might be Kiffin having a better social media presence. Before the season, I sat down with former Ohio State AD Gene Smith, who laid out part of the strategy for this $20 million roster. \"One thing one of the donors said was, 'I want to help but I keep reading and hearing that [Day] may go coach in the pros,' Smith said. \"I can't answer that question ... I just told him, 'There are questions we can answer but they're not as meaningful unless you answer them.'\" Day was all in making calls to key donors to assure them of his loyalty. Smith said there was an 80% positive response from those donating to the collectives. These two things can't be true: Day being desired by the NFL and Day not being good enough for Ohio State. Time for everyone in Columbus to figure out what they want. The playoff run should have mitigated any doubts because that's what the new playoff does. It puts less of an emphasis on winning your league. Look at the bracket. No conference champs remain and that's OK. Day definitely shouldn't be roasted over an open fire. If this was the old four-team format, Ohio State wouldn't be in it. As it stands, the Buckeyes can win 14 games and still lose to Michigan. And that -- earmuffs, Buck Nation -- would be OK. We're obsessing about Michigan because Buckeye Fan has driven us in its converted minivan adorned with Scarlet and Gray flags to this place. Day doesn't need the aggravation. His family doesn't need the stress. The Michigan thing -- actually, the job itself -- has become something bigger and uglier than what Day bought into. Yeah, yeah, I know. \"Give me the $9 million per year and I'll figure it out.\" That's valid. So is this: The further we get away from that day against Michigan, that's all it was. Day brought the team together after that game. There was a team meeting. The Buckeyes refocused. Tennessee was beaten by 25. The margin in the Oregon game was the largest in the Rose Bowl by any team in nine years. Let's not ask if Day can win the big one. Harbaugh was responsible for the final five games of a Michigan eight-game losing streak to the Buckeyes. Given enough time he won that national championship. The question for Day at Ohio State is whether a natty will even be enough. The next trip to Ann Arbor is less than 11 months away. There are several NFL teams that will need a new coach before that date. And football at the highest level needs mattress salesmen, too.

                "title": "Ryan Day (American football) - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Ryan Patrick Day[2][3] is an American football coach and former college football player. He is the 24th and current head football coach at Ohio State University, a position he has held since 2019. Day was also the acting head coach for the Ohio State Buckeyes for the first three games of the 2018 season. He attended the University of New Hampshire, where he played quarterback and linebacker for the Wildcats from 1998 to 2001 before he began his coaching career in 2002. Day attended Manchester Central High School in Manchester, New Hampshire.[4] As a quarterback and defensive back, he was the state's Gatorade Player of the Year for his senior season.[4] Day attended the University of New Hampshire. Playing for then-offensive coordinator Chip Kelly, Day set four career records at UNH, including completion percentage and touchdowns.[5][6] Day was the offensive coordinator for Temple in 2012, as well as the offensive coordinator for Boston College from 2013 to 2014.[7][8] He was hired as the Philadelphia Eagles' quarterbacks coach on January 22, 2015.[9] Then, in 2016, after his mentor Chip Kelly was relieved of his duties in Philadelphia, Day was hired in the same role by Kelly, who became the head coach of the San Francisco 49ers.[10] On January 3, 2017, Day was hired to replace co-offensive coordinator Tim Beck of the Ohio State Buckeyes.[11] After being linked to the Tennessee Titans offensive coordinator position in January 2018, Day was promoted to offensive coordinator and primary play caller at Ohio State.[12] On August 1, 2018, Day was named acting head coach at Ohio State when head coach Urban Meyer was placed on administrative leave[13] when news came to light of Meyer's knowledge of events surrounding then-fired Zach Smith's domestic violence accusations made by Smith's estranged wife. Day won all three games during Meyer's absence.[14] On December 4, 2018, Ohio State announced that Meyer would retire as head coach after the 2019 Rose Bowl and be replaced by Day on a full-time basis.[15][16] In 2019, Day's first season as a full-time head coach, he led the Buckeyes to a perfect 12–0 regular season record, the Buckeyes' first undefeated regular season since 2013.[17] Despite being predicted to finish second in the Big Ten East Division according to the 2019 Cleveland.com preseason poll,[18] the Buckeyes clinched the division following their November 23 victory over Penn State, and secured a spot in the Big Ten Championship,[19] which won over Wisconsin, 34–21.[20] The Buckeyes were named the number two seed in the College Football Playoff and lost to the Clemson Tigers in the Fiesta Bowl.[21][22] On December 3, 2019, Coach Day was named the Dave McClain Coach of the Year by the media.[23] Day's second season was significantly shortened due to the Big Ten Conference's policies regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. The Buckeyes' regular season was shortened from 12 games to 8 games,[24] and then down to 5 because of cancellations due to the pandemic.[25][26][27] After starting the season 4–0, Coach Day was forced to miss the December 5 game against Michigan State after testing positive for COVID-19,[28] which the Buckeyes won, 52–12. What would have been Ohio State's sixth regular season game, against rival Michigan, was cancelled due to COVID-19 concerns within the Michigan program. This was the first time since the 1917 season that Ohio State and Michigan did not play each other. The Big Ten's coronavirus policies would have prevented the Buckeyes from playing in the 2020 Big Ten Football Championship Game, as they did not meet the six-game threshold put forth by the conference.[29] However, on December 9, 2020, the Big Ten administrative council voted to remove the six game minimum, allowing Ohio State to advance to the conference championship.[30] The Buckeyes played in the Big Ten Championship game on December 19, where they beat the Northwestern Wildcats 22–10.[31] Ohio State was selected as the number 3 seed in the College Football Playoff, where they faced number 2 Clemson in the 2021 Sugar Bowl.[32] Ohio State defeated Clemson 49–28, and advanced to the 2021 College Football Playoff National Championship, to face number 1 Alabama.[33] The Buckeyes lost to Alabama 52–24.[34] The 2021 season, Day's third full season as head coach, began with the Buckeyes ranked fourth in both the AP and Coaches' Poll.[35][36] After an early season upset by Oregon, Day led Ohio State through a nine-game win streak behind Heisman finalist C. J. Stroud.[37][38] Ohio State had wins against then 20th-ranked Penn State and fifth-ranked Michigan State. Going into the Michigan game, Ohio State was ranked No. 2 and Michigan was ranked No. 5 by the College Football Playoff committee. Michigan defeated Ohio State for the first time since 2011.[39] Though Ohio State and Michigan tied for the division championship, the head-to-head victory earned Michigan the right to represent the Big Ten East in the Conference Championship game. This loss also effectively eliminated Ohio State from playoff contention. Ohio State was selected to play against Utah in the Rose Bowl.[40] Ohio State won the Rose Bowl, 48–45.[41] The 2022 season, which was Day's fourth full season at the helm, featured the Buckeyes starting ranked #2 in the nation in both the AP and Coaches' Poll.[42] With returning quarterback C. J. Stroud, Ohio State managed to start 8–0, with double digit wins at home over a then-top 5 Notre Dame and away at the #13 ranked Penn State Nittany Lions.[43][44] In the inaugural College Football Playoff rankings of the season, the Buckeyes landed at #2, a spot they would hold for four weeks.[45] Though they struggled in games[46][47] against a 1–7 Northwestern and a 6–4 Maryland, Ohio State managed to remain undefeated heading into the matchup against #3 Michigan for the series' second matchup of 11–0 teams (the first since 2006),[48] and the third meeting between top-5 teams since they met in 2016.[49] Despite being favored by eight points,[50] Ohio State lost 45–23, and managed to score only three points in the second half.[51] With this loss, Ohio State failed to reach the Big Ten Championship for the second consecutive season, and Ryan Day fell to 1–2 against the Wolverines, becoming the first Ohio State head coach to lose multiple games to Michigan in the 21st century.

                "content": "Zion Lateef Williamson (born July 6, 2000) is an American professional basketball player for the New Orleans Pelicans of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He plays the power forward position.[1] Following a freshman-year stint with the Duke Blue Devils, Williamson was selected by the Pelicans with the first overall pick in the 2019 NBA draft. He was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team in 2020. In 2021, he became the fourth youngest NBA player to be selected to an All-Star game.[2] Born in Salisbury, North Carolina, Williamson attended Spartanburg Day School, where he was a consensus five-star recruit and was ranked among the top five players in the 2018 class.

On July 6, 2000,[1] Williamson was born in Salisbury, North Carolina to Lateef Williamson and Sharonda Sampson.[3] Lateef Williamson was a football defensive lineman at Mayo High School in Darlington, South Carolina, who was a High School All-American in 1993 and had committed to NC State before transferring to Livingstone College.[4][3] Sampson was a sprinter at Livingstone and became a middle school health and physical education teacher.[3] She named Williamson after the biblical location Mount Zion near Jerusalem, taking her grandmother's advice to name him \"something extra special.\"[5] When Williamson reached two years of age, following the death of his maternal grandmother, his family moved to Florence, South Carolina.[4][3] By the time he was five years old, his parents had divorced. His mother later married Lee Anderson, a former Clemson college basketball player.[6][4] Williamson is Baptist.[7] Besides basketball, Williamson played soccer and the quarterback position in football.[5] When he was five years old, he set sights on becoming a college basketball star.

(Mike Krzyzewski) is just the most legendary coach that ever coached college basketball. I feel like going to Duke University, I can learn a lot from him.\"[43] Duke, who had landed RJ Barrett and Cam Reddish in addition to Williamson, became the first team to land the top three recruits in a class since modern recruiting rankings began.[44] Williamson's stepfather, Lee Anderson, remarked that Clemson lost a \"mile-and-a-half lead\" in recruiting Williamson.[45] Sources: On November 6, 2018, in his first regular season game with Duke, Williamson scored 28 points on 11-of-13 shooting in 23 minutes in a 118–84 win over Kentucky at the Champions Classic.[46] In that game, he and teammate RJ Barrett each broke the Duke freshman debut scoring record set by Marvin Bagley III.[47] In his following game, a 94–72 victory over Army, Williamson tallied 27 points, 16 rebounds, and six blocks.[48] He became the second player in school history to record at least 25 points, 15 rebounds, and 5 blocks in a game.[49] Williamson was subsequently named both player and freshman of the week in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).[49] On January 5, 2019, he had another strong performance versus Clemson, with 25 points, 10 rebounds, and a 360-degree dunk in 22 minutes.[50] Two days later, Williamson earned ACC Freshman of the Week honors for a second time.[51] On January 12, against Florida State, he was poked in the left eye by an opposing player towards the second half and missed the remainder of the game.[52] Williamson returned in Duke's next game, a 95–91 overtime loss to Syracuse, and erupted for 35 points, 10 rebounds, and 4 blocks.[53] He eclipsed the Duke freshman record for single-game points previously held by Marvin Bagley III and JJ Redick.[54] On January 21, Williamson collected his third ACC Freshman of the Week accolade.[55] One week later, he scored 26 points and grabbed 9 rebounds in an 81–63 victory over Notre Dame.[56] By recording nine 25-point games in the season, Williamson set a new Duke freshman record.[57] On February 4, 2019, Williamson was named ACC Freshman of the Week on his fourth occasion, while earning a National Player of the Week distinction from the Naismith Trophy.[58] He had his third 30-point game of the season on February 16, scoring 32 points in a 94–78 victory over NC State.[59] The performance helped him claim his second ACC Player of the Week and fifth ACC Freshman of the Week accolades.[60] In a February 20 game versus North Carolina, Williamson suffered a Grade 1 knee sprain 36 seconds into the contest after his foot ripped through his Nike shoe, causing him to slip.[61][62] He did not return to the game, which Duke lost, 88–72.[63] Nike saw the value of its stock drop by $1.1 billion the following day as a result of the incident.[64][65] The injury resulted in criticism of the NCAA for not paying student-athletes.[66][67][68] Williamson was held out from the final six games of the regular season.[69] When the regular season concluded, Williamson earned Player of the Year and Rookie of the Year honors in the ACC, joining former Duke players Jahlil Okafor and Marvin Bagley III as the only recipients of both awards. Williamson was also named ACC Athlete of the Year, becoming the 10th Duke player to win the Award.[70] He additionally made the ACC All-Defensive and All-Freshman teams.[71] Sporting News named Williamson as its Player of the Year and Freshman of the Year.[72] Williamson returned from injury on March 14, posting 29 points, 14 rebounds, and 5 steals in an 84–72 win over Syracuse in the quarterfinals of the ACC tournament.[73] He shot 13-of-13 from the field, marking the best shooting performance in school and tournament history, while tying the record for the best shooting performance in ACC history.[74] Williamson also became the first Duke player to record at least 25 points, 10 rebounds, and 5 steals in a game since Christian Laettner did so in 1992.[75] The next day, he scored 31 points (including the game-winning shot) to help Duke defeat North Carolina, 74–73, in the ACC Tournament semifinals.[76] After posting 21 points in a 73–63 victory over Florida State in the championship game, Williamson was named ACC Tournament MVP, becoming the sixth freshman to win the honor.[77] For the 2019 NCAA tournament, official broadcast partner CBS specifically devoted a camera—called the \"Zion Cam\"—to record Williamson throughout the tournament.[78] In his NCAA Tournament debut on March 22, he scored 25 points in an 85–62 win over 16th-seeded North Dakota State.[79] On March 24, Williamson erupted for 32 points, 11 rebounds, and four assists in a 77–76 second-round victory over UCF.[80] Williamson led all scorers on March 31, with 24 points and 14 rebounds in a season-ending 68–67 loss to Michigan State in the Elite 8.[81] In 33 appearances in his freshman season, he averaged 22.6 points, 8.9 rebounds, 2.1 steals, and 1.8 blocks per game.[82] He shot 68% from the field, which led the ACC, ranked second in the NCAA Division I, and was the highest-ever field goal percentage by a freshman.[83][84] In addition, Williamson joined Kevin Durant and Anthony Davis as one of the only freshmen in history to collect 500 points, 50 steals, and 50 blocks in a season.[84] On April 15, 2019, Williamson declared his eligibility for the 2019 NBA draft.[85] On June 20, 2019, the New Orleans Pelicans drafted Williamson with the first pick in the 2019 NBA draft.[86][87][88] On July 1, 2019, Williamson officially signed with the Pelicans.[89] Williamson tore his meniscus on October 13, 2019, during the preseason of his rookie campaign.[90] Williamson made his professional debut three months later on January 22, 2020, in a 121–117 loss to the San Antonio Spurs. He played 18 minutes and finished with 22 points and 7 rebounds, scoring 17 consecutive points in 3:08 minutes during the fourth quarter.[91] In his first eight games, Williamson scored at least 20 points in four consecutive games, the longest streak by any rookie of the season; he also tied the longest streak in the Pelicans franchise history, scoring at least 20 points in six of his eight games, and tying the record for the seventh-most among all rookies (fellow rookie Ja Morant had the most with 19) after a 125–119 win over the Chicago Bulls on February 7.[92] On February 24, he led the Pelicans to a 115–101 win over the Golden State Warriors.

The streak eventually grew to 25 consecutive games, surpassing Hall-of-Famers Wilt Chamberlain and Karl Malone[101][102] while tying Shaquille O'Neal's record of 25 consecutive such games,[103] with no other player having had a longer streak since the three-point era in 1980; his streak of 20-points games on 50-percent shooting and attempt to surpass O'Neal's record ended in a 139–111 loss to the Brooklyn Nets on April 7.[104] During the off-season, Williamson suffered a Jones fracture in his right foot and underwent a subsequent surgery.

A final dunk he made in the last seconds of the game caused an altercation between the Pelicans and Suns.[113] On December 12, Williamson was named the NBA Western Conference Player of the Week for Week 8 (December 5–11), his first NBA Player of the Week award. He led New Orleans to an undefeated 3–0 week with averages of 33.0 points and 8.3 rebounds on 70.4% shooting from the field.[114] On December 28, Williamson put up a career-high 43 points in a 119–118 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves.[115] Williamson was sidelined on January 2, 2023, with a hamstring injury.

His NBA postseason debut was cut short by an injury in the final minutes of the game.[124] Williamson is listed at 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) tall and weighs 284 pounds (129 kg).[125][126] Despite his heavy weight for a basketball player, he is known for his speed and leaping ability.[127][128] NBA player Kevin Durant described him as a \"once-in-a-generation type athlete\" while an anonymous college basketball coach labeled him a \"freak of nature.\"[129][130] Williamson plays the power forward position but is also capable of being a small-ball center.[131] He has been described as not fitting a specific basketball position.[132] His physical attributes have drawn comparisons to former NBA stars Charles Barkley, Anthony Mason, and Larry Johnson.[133][134] In addition, according to different analysts, he resembles NBA players LeBron James and Julius Randle.[132] Lee Sartor, Williamson's high school coach, reported that basketball coach Roy Williams told Williamson \"that he was probably one of the best high school players he's seen since Michael Jordan.\"[135] Williamson, who is left-handed, is almost ambidextrous.[132] While in high school, Williamson drew national attention for his slam dunks.[136] The Charlotte Observer remarked that he \"could be the best high-school dunker in history.\"[137] NBA point guard John Wall has likened Williamson's in-game dunking ability to that of Vince Carter.[138] Williamson's outside shooting has been considered a point of concern, and he has unorthodox shot mechanics.[4][9][139] Recruiting service 247Sports has praised his ball handling and passing skills for his size, commenting that they are \"overshadowed by [his] athletic plays.\"[140] Williamson has the ability to defend multiple positions well due to his speed and length, although his defensive effort has been questioned.[141] He is a skilled shot-blocker and rebounder.[142] At various points during his NBA career, Williamson has received criticism in the media from basketball observers who perceive him to be overweight.[143][144][145][146] Prior to the start of the 2021–2022 season, Williamson's weight increased to over 300 lbs.[145] Williamson lost weight in 2022.[147] In 2023, however, retired basketball players Charles Barkley and Shaquille O'Neal each expressed concerns about Williamson's weight.[148][149] Williamson's 2022 contract extension with the New Orleans Pelicans provides for salary reductions in the event that Williamson fails to maintain his weight and body fat percentage at specified levels.[150] Since the inaugural In-Season Tournament during the 2023 season, Williamson has seen significant improvements to his physique, losing 25 lbs.[151] On July 23, 2019, Williamson signed a five-year, $75 million shoe deal with Jordan brand.[152] Williamson's deal is the second-largest rookie shoe deal in history, trailing only LeBron James's $90 million rookie deal signed in 2003.[153] On March 13, 2020, Williamson pledged to pay for the salaries of all the employees of the Smoothie King Center for 30 days during the suspension of the 2019–20 NBA season, which was caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. He was one of several basketball players to help the arena workers.[154] In June 2023, Williamson announced his girlfriend's pregnancy in a baby shower YouTube video with the couple expecting a daughter due in November.[155] This announcement led adult film star Moriah Mills to claim on Twitter that she had a recent affair with Williamson.[156]",

                "content": "Editions: En/basketball/nba/new-orleans-pelicans The Pelicans forward missed 27 games due to injury but now faces a one-game suspension for violating team policies. Zion Williamson's much-anticipated return to basketball has been met with unexpected hurdles. Less than a week after rejoining the New Orleans Pelicans following a 27-game absence due to a hamstring injury, the 24-year-old forward has been suspended for one game for violating team policies. The Pelicans announced on Friday that Williamson would sit out the team's game against the Philadelphia 76ers that evening. He is expected to rejoin the roster over the weekend. According to Shams Charania of ESPN, the suspension stems from Williamson arriving late for the team's flight to Philadelphia. Tuesday marked Williamson's first game since his extended injury hiatus, and he delivered an impressive performance against the Minnesota Timberwolves. The two-time All-Star recorded 22 points, six rebounds, four assists, three steals, and one block in 28 minutes on the court. However, his momentum was interrupted when he sat out Wednesday's game due to team protocol for back-to-back matchups. Despite having played only seven games this season, Williamson has shown flashes of his All-Star potential. He's currently averaging 22.6 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 5.1 assists per game, along with notable defensive stats. His contributions on both ends of the floor remain vital for the Pelicans, who are striving for playoff contention. Williamson's journey back to full form has been marred by both injuries and off-court challenges. The Pelicans, who selected him first overall in the 2019 NBA Draft, continue to depend on his leadership and athleticism. However, the recent suspension raises questions about his commitment and focus as he works to solidify his presence on the court. Fans and analysts alike are watching closely to see how Williamson bounces back from this setback. While his suspension is a minor hiccup in the grand scheme, it adds to the narrative of an already tumultuous season. With his immense talent and potential, the hope remains that Williamson will overcome these challenges and lead the Pelicans to success. As the weekend approaches, all eyes will be on his return to the lineup and his ability to maintain consistency both on and off the court. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U.

Borussia Dortmund 2-3 Bayer Leverkusen Goals: 0-1 Tella 1' (assist: Andrich), 0-2 Schick 8' (assist: Hincapié), 1-2 Gittens (12'), 1-3 Schick 19' (assist: Frimpong), 2-3 Guirassy (pen. 79') Xabi Alonso's side wasted no time in stamping their authority on the match. Nathan Tella sent shockwaves through the Dortmund faithful inside the opening minute, finding the net after just 25 seconds. The early goal set the tone for a frenetic opening period, with Leverkusen's high-pressing game causing havoc in the Dortmund defence. Schick then took centre stage, doubling the visitors' lead in the eighth minute with a clinical finish from close range. The hosts, stunned by Leverkusen's explosive start, found a lifeline through Jamie Gittens. The young forward's 12th-minute strike breathed new life into Dortmund and the Signal Iduna Park. However, their joy was short-lived as Schick struck again in the 19th minute, restoring Leverkusen's two-goal cushion. Dortmund's defensive frailties were evident, with the makeshift backline struggling to contain Leverkusen's fluid attack. The second half saw a resurgent Dortmund push for a comeback. Nuri Şahin's men dominated possession and created several chances, but found Lukáš Hrádecký in inspired form. The breakthrough finally came in the 79th minute when Serhou Guirassy converted from the penalty spot, setting up a grandstand finish. Despite late pressure, Leverkusen's defence, marshalled by the impressive Edmond Tapsoba, held firm to secure a vital victory.

                "title": "Leverkusen beat virus-hit Dortmund to close gap on Bayern",
                "content": "Dortmund (Germany) (AFP) – Patrik Schick scored a first-half brace as Bayer Leverkusen won 3-2 at a flu-hit Borussia Dortmund on Friday, closing the gap to Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich to one point. Issued on: 10/01/2025 - 23:05Modified: 10/01/2025 - 23:34 Already struck by an injury crisis, illness ripped through Dortmund's defence, with centre-backs Emre Can and Nico Schlotterbeck, along with left-back Ramy Bensebaini, ruled out just hours before kick-off as the Bundesliga restarted from the winter break. The defending champions took advantage of Dortmund's inexperienced defence early, scoring through Nathan Tella after just 25 seconds before Patrik Schick added another on the eight-minute mark. English winger Jamie Gittens pulled one back but Schick restored Leverkusen's two-goal lead shortly afterwards. A late Serhou Guirassy penalty gave Dortmund hope but Leverkusen held on for their ninth straight win in all competitions, turning up the heat on Bayern, who travel to Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday. \"I'll be honest, we're not looking at Bayern, we're focused on ourselves and we're on the right track,\" Leverkusen's Granit Xhaka told DAZN. Leverkusen coach Xabi Alonso benched in-form midfielder Florian Wirtz due to an \"internal issue\". Dortmund's problems were less vague, with three first-choice centre-backs along with wing-backs Pascal Gross and Bensebaini missing. Dortmund's makeshift defence, including youngsters Almugera Kabar and Yannik Luehrs, was breached almost immediately. England-born Nigeria winger Tella unleashed a superb strike into the top corner after Leverkusen pressed the nervous hosts into a mistake while playing out from the back. The visitors quickly doubled their lead, Schick tapping in Piero Hincapie's low cross. Dortmund dragged themselves back into the match just four minutes later when Gittens chipped in after Robert Andrich inadvertently poked the ball into his path. Schick however added his second and Leverkusen's third on the 19-minute mark, this time diverting in a cross from the right. \"I expect my lads to defend better than that, even with the situation we have in defence,\" Dortmund coach Nuri Sahin said. Schick, who started the season on the bench behind Victor Boniface, now has 11 goals in his past six league appearances. \"I work hard every day. I was of course ready when the chance came,\" Schick said. \"I want to give the max for the team and I'm happy I could help out with a couple of goals.\" With 11 minutes remaining, VAR awarded Leverkusen a penalty and Guirassy converted nervelessly from the spot to give the home side a shot at snatching an unlikely point, but Leverkusen held firm. Champions League finalists last season, Dortmund have won just one of their past five Bundesliga fixtures and could finish the weekend as low as 10th. © 2025 AFP © 2025 Copyright France 24 - All rights reserved.

In a statement shared by New York Fire Department chief John Esposito, the department reported “seven minor injuries, five to firefighters and two to civilians” from the fire on Wallace Avenue. Related: Apartment Fire in NYC Injures 21 People, Displaces 90 Families: 'Everybody Was Panicking' The number of reported injuries is now eight, according to ABC 7 NY. “We arrived here a little after 1:45 this morning,” Esposito said, adding that firefighters found the blaze “in the ceiling above the top floor, between the ceiling and the underside of the roof.” The area, called the “cockloft,” is “an open area for the entire length and width of the building,\" the fire chief noted. “Heavy fire destroyed [all the] apartments on the top floor and burnt through the roof,” his statement continued. New York City Fire Department/X According to NYFD, fire companies began searching and removing residents from the fire while also putting out the flames, but “the fire had too much headway.” “It was extremely dangerous for our firefighters. We removed them from the building, and we're using tower ladders to extinguish the rest of the building, and we're continuing with that operation,” Esposito said. “We had no water problems due to the cold. The wind did play a part in spreading the fire through the cockloft.” The blaze was put out before 2 p.m. local time, according to ABC 7 NY.

                "title": "Bronx fire leaves 7 injured as 200 firefighters respond to five-alarm blaze",
                "content": "A massive blaze ripped through a Bronx apartment building owned by a man who once was named the city’s “worst landlord” Friday, leaving at least seven people injured and hundreds forced to find other shelter, officials said. Some 200 FDNY firefighters responded to the 1:40 a.m. inferno at the six-story 2910 Wallace Ave. in the East Bronx — where alarming video showed huge plumes of fire billowing from the roof. “I know my apartment is done. I lost everything,” Vanessa 0., 34, told The Post as firefighters continued to fight the smoldering blaze before noon Friday. “My husband works from home, he has computers, electronics … everything we need. I need clothes to go to work. I wear suits to work. This is all I have,” she continued, pointing to the sweatpants and light coat she was wearing. Vanessa, a tenant of five years, was alerted to the flames by the sound of fire engines early this morning. No smoke or fire alarms were set off, she said. “We opened our doors and we saw them bringing in the hose upstairs. We didn’t run out. The fire department was so busy trying to get the hose to the top floor, they didn’t even tell us to leave,” Vanessa said. “The electricity went off in the building and that’s when they moved everybody to the lobby. I’m guessing they evacuated maybe four or five in the morning but initially everybody was there.” Multiple tenants told The Post that the building has been suffering from numerous problems over the last few months — and alleged that the landlord, Parkash Management, had done little to quell their concerns. The company’s owner, Ved Parkash, made headlines one decade ago after being named the city’s “worst landlord” by then-Public Advocate Letitia James for allowing his buildings to fall into squalor. Fire officials said Friday’s blaze started in the cockloft — the space between the ceiling and the underside of the roof — though they could not say the cause as the fire continued to burn until it was finally brought under control around 3 p.m. Within an hour, “heavy wind conditions” elevated the fire to five alarms — the highest alarm level indicating a severe fire, according to the FDNY. “The fire had too much headway. It was extremely dangerous for our firefighters,” said John Esposito, the FDNY’s Chief of Department. The seven injured include five firefighters and two civilians, the FDNY said. One of the civilians was treated at the scene and declined to be taken to a hospital. The seven injured include five firefighters and two civilians, the FDNY said. None of the injuries were life-threatening. One of the civilians was treated at the scene and declined to be taken to a hospital. The roof was completely burned off, and all the apartments on the top floor were destroyed. The lower levels were flooded, according to Vanessa. At least 66 families were displaced by the blaze. Officials opened a temporary relief zone at P.S. 76, the Bennington School, down the corner from the scorched apartment building. Gluendy Disz, 28, and her mother had only been living in the East Bronx apartment building for a few months when the fire tore through the building Friday. “Everything is destroyed but I’m hanging in there,” Diaz told The Post while clutching Dexter, her three-year-old black Labrador. “He was the first thing I grabbed,” she said. The surgical coordinator and her mother had been sleeping when the chaos erupted. “The firefighters were just coming up the stairs. We had just woken up and it was already going on,” Diaz recalled. “I was nervous, I was frightened.” Luz Gonzalez, 65, has lived in a third-floor apartment for over 20 years, said broken heaters, water leaking through light fixtures and collapsed ceilings have been among the complaints she and her neighbors have filed in recent months. “We’ve been telling them that something was going through our ceilings, water was going through our lightbulbs and everything was horrible, but they didn’t listen to us,” Gonzalez told The Post. “Water is coming through my lightbulb. Do you know what he had the nerve to tell me? To wait until after the holidays,” she continued. “I lost everything. I don’t have nothing, nothing at all, but he sure wants his rent.” Lilia Elva Gonzalez, a ground-floor tenant of 17 years, complained that the electricity in her apartment was not up to standard. “Do you think this is fair? No! I pay my rent. I have my record, each month I pay my rent. I always complain. They don’t listen to me,” she told The Post. “This is about the owners, they do nothing. Why did they wait for this to happen when they could’ve fixed it before but didn’t do it, right?” Various 311 reports back up the displaced tenants’ allegations — particularly that the building had been suffering heating issues for months. Roughly 70 complaints stretching back to November claim there was no heat in the building — an issue some residents may have tried to remedy themselves with space heaters and ovens. “From the FDNY’s perspective, we would ask people not to do that. It’s cold weather. Obviously, that’s a very dangerous situation. It can cause fires to happen, and we hope that we are sending the message that fire safety in the cold weather is super important, and to report any situations like that to 3-1-1 immediately,” said Fire Commissioner Robert Tucker. While it is still unclear what caused the massive blaze, Parkash has a storied history of allegedly neglecting his numerous buildings, which mostly pepper the Bronx. In 2017, Parkash made headlines for allowing conditions in another Bronx building to deteriorate so severely that it bred a deadly rat-borne bacterial disease to flourish. Three people caught leptospirosis, which is linked to rat urine — one of whom succumbed to the infection. Parkash has also been accused of illegally dividing apartment basements into additional units. He was dubbed the city’s “worst landlord” two years before the rat infestation, though Parkash managed to avoid the city’s dishonor list in 2023. When reached for comment, a spokesperson for the landlord, Parkash Management said, “We are withholding comment because this is an active fire investigation.” Advertisement",

By Isabella KwaiLola Fadulu and Bernard Mokam Dozens of families were looking for shelter after a large fire broke out at an apartment building in the Bronx early Friday, injuring at least seven people, the Fire Department said. There were no fatalities or life-threatening injuries, according to officials. The Red Cross was at the scene helping residents who were displaced, and a temporary shelter had been set up nearby at the Bennington School on Adee Avenue. The organization provided food throughout the day and was working to connect people with temporary lodging in hotels, said Frederic Klein, a spokesman. By Friday afternoon, 254 people from 93 households had registered to receive help, according to the Red Cross, including more than 55 households who needed lodging. “Not everybody will register with us if they have the ability to recover on their own,” Mr. Klein said. In the short term, he said, people would be put in hotels, where they would meet with a caseworker who could help them transition into the city’s shelter system. The Red Cross was also working to provide people with mental health support and to help them replace any prescription medications that they couldn’t retrieve from their homes. Earlier on Friday, about 250 firefighters and emergency medical workers rushed to the six-story residential building on Wallace Avenue near Arnow Avenue after a fire was reported there just before 2 a.m., the Fire Department said. The blaze on the top floor was elevated to a five-alarm fire about an hour later, it said. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

                "content": "Watch CBS News By Elijah Westbrook, Tony Aiello, Jennifer Bisram Updated on: January 11, 2025 / 12:22 AM EST / CBS New York NEW YORK -- A five-alarm fire broke out early Friday morning in the Bronx, leaving seven people hurt and more than 200 others displaced. Firefighters responded around 1:45 a.m. to a six-story apartment building at 2910 Wallace Avenue in the Allerton section of the borough. Once crews arrived, they determined the fire was coming from the top floor of the building. Within an hour, it quickly grew to five alarms. Crews spent hours trying to get the intense flames and smoke under control, but officials said the roof and all the apartments on the top floor were destroyed, and water damaged every other unit. \"Initially, we had fire companies inside conducting searches, removing people and attempting to fight the fire. The fire had too much headway, extremely dangerous for our firefighters. We removed them from the building and, you can see behind us, we're using tower ladders to extinguish the rest of the building, and we're continuing with that operation,\" one fire official said. Officials said the cold and windy conditions made it more difficult to fight the stubborn flames. \"This was a massive fire, and the wind played a major role in the conditions that we are facing,\" New York City Mayor Eric Adams told reporters on the scene. \"It's been a very long and cold morning here in the Bronx,\" FDNY Commissioner Ben Tucker added. \"This was a very, very large fire, wind-driven, as the mayor said. Very difficult fire for our firefighters to fight under conditions that caused us to have to have lots of relief.\" Five firefighters and two residents suffered minor injuries, and five of the victims were taken to area hospitals for treatment, according to the FDNY. \"Please pray for your neighbors here in Allerton. We know that these fires are happening far too often across our city, and we will do our very best to make sure that we protect New Yorkers during their time of need,\" said Bronx Borough President Vanessa Gibson. The Department of Buildings has issued a full vacate order and ordered the construction of a sidewalk shed around the building. Residents who lost everything are now trying to figure out what they will do for food and shelter. Many ran out of their apartments in the cold with nothing but the clothes on their backs. \"This is like hitting rock bottom, to be honest. It's starting from zero,\" said Jarixa Guzman, a mother of four whose family lost their cats in the fire. \"It was just one place, it was one apartment, it was very small in front of the building. Then out of nowhere, it became a nightmare. I didn't see everything that was happening, I just saw a lot of black smoke,\" resident Nicole Novoa said. \"I don't even know how to feel right now, it's just so many different emotions. Thank God I'm alive, honestly, and I'm in one piece.\" The city's Office of Emergency Management directed residents to P.S. 76 on Adee Avenue, where the Red Cross was ready to help those displaced. So far, the organization says it registered 81 families, a total of 202 people. Friday night, neighbors stopped by the school to drop off donations. \"I just felt like it was right in my heart to donate to these people, and I feel so bad, you know. After the holidays and settling in after the new year, this is just an awful thing that happened to the community,\" neighbor Kayla Ravagnan said. The Red Cross will be back at P.S. 76 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday to help any families that may still need assistance. \"We got more help from them in a couple of hours than we ever did with our landlord,\" fire victim Ricardine Bernard said. Novoa said there has been little-to-no heat at the apartment building for about three years. \"There's days that you wake up and there's no hot water or there's no heating. I work from home and I work with a coat on, it's freezing,\" she said. \"We have a lot of electricity problems and we also don't have no heating. So a lot of us do have space heaters on, so I'm sure that's part of the reason that it triggered it.\" Guzman said wiring was an issue, too. \"'Cause there's not even a breaker box. It's a fuse, like the little screw-in types,\" she said. The mayor and fire commissioner told reporters they were not aware of the complaints about the heat, but vowed to get answers for the residents. \"We are going to have DOB and other city agencies look into if there's a chronic issue. Going to look at if there are 311 calls that were made, what follow-up was conducted. And we're going to find out what the cause of this fire is,\" said Adams. \"But we will look into if those were some of the concerns.\" CBS News New York has learned there have been about 70 complaints made to 311 about lack of heat and hot water since October 2024. All were resolved except a complaint made on Jan. 8, two days before the fire. \"The landlord was a slumlord. He didn't do nothing for the building,\" neighbor John Walker said. Through a spokesperson, landlord Ved Parkash said, \"We are withholding comment because this is an active fire investigation.\" We've reported on tenant complaints involving his buildings many times, dating back to 2013. He was named by the public advocate one of the city's worst landlords in 2015. The official cause of the fire remains under investigation. Alecia Reid contributed to this report.

            {
                "title": "Notre Dame edges Penn State in wild Orange Bowl to reach first national championship game in 12 years - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. For the first time since 2012, Notre Dame will play for a national title. The (7) Fighting Irish advanced to the College Football Playoff National Championship with a 27-24 win against (6) Penn State in Thursday evening's Orange Bowl. Fittingly, in a game that saw four lead changes, it came down to some last-second heroics. Penn State had a chance to win the game. The Nittany Lions took possession on their own 15-yard line with 52 seconds to play and two timeouts. Needing yardage to get into field goal range, they decided to lean on the arm of quarterback Drew Allar, who hopped around in the pocket and tried the middle of the field, where Notre Dame defensive back Christian Gray made a diving interception to give his team possession in Penn State territory. After a couple of runs and a 10-yard connection between quarterback Riley Leonard and wide receiver Jaden Greathouse, Notre Dame worked the ball into field goal range. Kicker Mitch Jeter -- who is now 7 of 8 during Notre Dame's College Football Playoff run -- nailed a 41-yard field goal to send his team to Atlanta. Penn State tried to lateral its way to a miraculous win on one final possession, but Notre Dame's defense was up to the task. This loss especially stings for Penn State, given that it led 10-0 late into the first half. The Nittany Lions also scored 14 unanswered points early in the fourth quarter to take a 24-17 lead -- stoning a 17-0 run from Notre Dame in the process -- and, of course, possessed the ball with less than a minute to play. CBS Sports was here throughout with updates, highlights and analysis. Read on below for takeaways from Notre Dame's win over Penn State. Penn State edge rusher Abdul Carter's status was up in the air ahead of the Orange Bowl. He suffered a left shoulder injury in the quarterfinal round against Boise State that caused him to miss a majority of the game, and most of his left arm was wrapped tonight. Still, he suited up and made his presence felt. Carter finished the game with five total tackles, two for a loss, and one sack. He also collected several quarterback pressures while moving all over the field in Penn State's pass-rush packages. One of those pressured forced Notre Dame quarterback Riley Leonard into throwing an interception. Carter did all that in spite of the fact his left shoulder was still bothering him. Now he's likely off to the NFL Draft, where most projections have him going off the board early in the first round. Penn State running back Nick Singleton deserves special mention for his Herculean efforts. The Nittany Lions star carried the ball 15 times for 84 yards and scored all three of his team's offensive touchdowns. Penn State tight end Tyler Warren also did a lot for the Nittany Lions and finished the game with 96 total yards. But those efforts underscored a serious problem for Penn State, one that tanked its hopes as the game wore on: the Nittany Lions seriously lack in playmakers on the outside. Penn State's wide receivers did not record a single catch on just five targets. Though Warren and Singleton are excellent options, the lack of a threat elsewhere allowed Notre Dame's defense to focus on stopping that dynamic duo. Penn State's final drive was an example: no one was able to get open deep or break a big play. Compare that to Notre Dame, which had a star emerge in sophomore wide receiver Jaden Greathouse. He was a safety valve with the biggest play of the night -- a 54-yard score with a pair of ankle breakers that tied the game at 24 with just under five minutes left to play in the fourth quarter. Third down is the money down for a reason. In a game where Penn State and Notre Dame traded blows and finished with relatively comparable stats (though the Nittany Lions did have a significant rushing advantage) third downs made all the difference. Penn State did almost everything wrong in third-down situations. The Nittany Lions were 3 of 11 and coverted just one in the second half. Notre Dame went 11 of 17 despite some long-to-go situations, gaining an average of seven yards and converting all eight attempts on third-and-short (4 yards or fewer). This is the same Notre Dame team that lost to Northern Illinois early in the year. This is the same Notre Dame team that has lost several of its top players, including a potential first-round cornerback in Benjamin Morrison and its leading sack artist in defensive lineman Rylie Mills, to injury. Through it all, the Fighting Irish have displayed a tremendous amount of grit and determination. That grit was on full display in the Orange Bowl. Quarterback Riley Leonard left the game late in the first half with an apparent head injury. He returned for the first drive in the third quarter, completed a 36 yard pass to Aneyas Williams and then rushed for a 3-yard touchdown to tie the game at 10. One of the key blockers on that play? Offensive lineman Charles Jagusah, who tore his pectoral muscle less than a month before the 2024 season began and only recently started playing again. Early in the fourth quarter, Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love -- who has been limited with a knee injury throughout the College Football Playoff -- plowed through three Penn State defenders and bullied his way into the end zone to give Notre Dame its first lead of the game. Then, with less than a minute to play, Notre Dame cornerback Christian Gray -- who has stepped into an increased role this year due to Morrison's injury -- was the one that intercepted Penn State quarterback Drew Allar. Notre Dame keeps finding a way, and now it's one win from a national title. Notre Dame kicker Mitch Jeter just nailed a 41-yard field goal to give Notre Dame a late lead with less than 10 seconds to play. Penn State will get chance to either tie the game or win, but it's going to take some real heroics since the Nittany Lions are out of timeouts. That was an inexcusable mistake from Penn State quarterback Drew Allar. Trying to lead the Nittany Lions on a potential game-winning drive, he instead threw an ill-advised interception to Notre Dame defensive back Christian Gray. Now Fighting Irish take over in Penn State territory with three timeouts. This after Notre Dame fumbled its own opportunity to potentially walk the game off. On third-and-5 from Penn State's 44-yard line -- not far from field goal range -- quarterback Riley Leonard dropped back to pass. He came under immediate pressure and sacked by Coziah Izzard, forcing the Fighting Irish to punt instead. Penn State will take over at its own 15-yard line with 47 seconds and two timeouts left. As they always say, football is a game of runs. Penn State appeared to be in firm control after ripping off a 14-0 scoring streak, but Notre Dame just swung momentum right back in its favor with a huge touchdown play. Wide receiver Jaden Greathouse got open in Penn State's secondary after a defensive back slipped and fell. Fighting Irish quarterback Riley Leonard hit Greathouse in stride, which allowed him to dance around another Penn State defender in the open field and finish the play by sprinting into the end zone. It's the first passing touchdown for either team and, at 54 yards, is also the longest play all evening. Might want to change Penn State's mascot to the Nick Singletons, because he is literally carrying the offense in the Orange Bowl. The Nittany Lions got the ball inside Notre Dame's 10-yard line thanks to a pass interference penalty on Notre Dame's Adon Shuler. There, Singleton took another handoff and dragged a Notre Dame defender into the end zone for his third touchdown of the night. Penn State was granted that scoring opportunity after Notre Dame quarterback Riley Leonard threw his second interception of the game. This is just Leonard's second multi-interception game of his career; the other was the NIU loss. That was a back-breaking mistake from Notre Dame quarterback Riley Leonard. One play after Notre Dame tied the game with a big touchdown, Leonard stared tight end Mitchell Evans down and thew an interception to Penn State's Dani Dennis-Sutton, who did a good job of undercutting Evans' route and reading Leonard's eyes. It's Penn State's second interception of the night, and it gives the Nittany Lions possession just outside field goal range. Not to be outdone, Penn State running back Nick Singleton just had an incredibly tough run of his own. On second-and-goal from Notre Dame's 7-yard line, Singleton took a handoff, changed direction, made one Notre Dame defender missed and then plowed through another would-be tackler near the goal line to score his second touchdown of the evening. That capped a huge drive for Penn State, which moved the ball down the field -- largely without star tight end Tyler Warren, who missed a chunk in the injury tent after a hard landing -- thanks to some solid play from quarterback Drew Allar. The Nittany Lions needed that answer after allowing 17 straight points to Notre Dame. Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love's knee looks alright. It certainly didn't keep him plowing through Penn State's defense for a crucial touchdown to open the fourth quarter. Love took an inside handoff and bounced off one Penn State defender. As he got near the line of scrimmage, he met a crowd of would-be tacklers, bowled through them and stretched the ball to break into the end zone. It's Notre Dame's second rushing touchdown of the night, and it gives the Irish their first lead. Penn State's offense, which managed just 25 yards in the third quarter, has to find its footing. Entering halftime, it appeared as if Notre Dame was taking on water. But a last-second field goal, and then a hot start to the third quarter, have momentum on the Fighting Irish's side as they enter the fourth quarter of their Orange Bowl showdown against Penn State. Key to Notre Dame's turnaround has been its play in the trenches on both sides of the ball. Though the offensive line has still allowed some leaks, it has done a much better job of opening lanes in the running game and keeping a clean pocket for quarterback Riley Leonard, who scored on a rushing touchdown early in the third quarter to tie the game at 10-all. He also had a big 36-yard completion to Aneyas Williams to put the Irish in scoring range. Defensively, Notre Dame allowed just 25 yards -- including -3 yards rushing -- in the third quarter. The Fighting Irish also got their first sack of the game, courtesy of Rod Heard II, to force a punt near the end of the third frame. Notre Dame will open the fourth quarter with the ball and a chance to take its first lead of the evening. Penn State has had some problems fielding punts in the Orange Bowl. Thus far, none of the decisions have ended in disaster, but it has made things more difficult for the Nittany Lions. After allowing a touchdown on the opening drive in the third quarter, Penn State's defense buckled down and just forced a punt. Return man Zion Tracy, instead of calling for a fair catch in the face of Notre Dame's punt coverage unit, decided to field the kick at the 15-yard line. He was blasted by a Notre Dame gunner and just held on to the ball. Earlier in the first quarter, Tracy called for a fair catch at Penn State's 2-yard line, so he's having some trouble making decisions on the fly. Game on. At one point near the end of the first half, this one seemed to be slipping away from Notre Dame. But a last-second field goal in the second quarter apparently gave the Fighting Irish the momentum they needed to swing the Orange Bowl right back. Riley Leonard looks fine. After exiting the game late in the first half, he led Notre Dame's offense onto the field in the third quarter and looked dialed in. He delivered a perfect 36-yard pass to Aneyas Williams to put Notre Dame in striking distance, and then finished the scoring drive a couple of plays later by rushing into the end zone from three yards out. Notre Dame's offensive line needed that drive. The Irish did a good job creating space in the run game and keeping the pocket clean after a rough first half. The pressure is back on Penn State now. Notre Dame will receive the second half's opening kickoff. There's plenty to keep an eye on as the Fighting Irish take the field. Top of the list is the status of quarterback Riley Leonard, who exited late in the first half with an apparent head injury. Backup Steve Angeli did well to get Notre Dame in field goal range as time expired, but Notre Dame has crafted its offense around Leonard this year. Notre Dame also has a couple of offensive linemen, including starting left tackle Anthonie Knapp, that have been dealing with injuries. Penn State leads Notre Dame 10-3 after the first half of play in the Orange Bowl. The Nittany Lions scored all 10 of their points in the second quarter thanks to a renewed focus on the run game and a pair of lengthy drives that took plenty of time off of the clock. Penn State took 14 plays to kick a 20-yard field goal near the start of the second quarter, and then embarked on a 17-play, 90-yard drive that ended in a 5-yard touchdown with just over two minutes left in the half. The Nittany Lions got 81 of those 90 yards running the ball thanks to an offensive linethat imposed its will. Penn State averaged a brisk 5.4 yards per carry in the first half. Tight end Tyler Warren, who also had 17 yards receiving, contributed 21 yards to Penn State's rushing attack. Penn State's defense also deserves plenty of credit. Notre Dame averaged 22.3 points per game in the first half over its 12-game winning streak entering the Orange Bowl but scored just three points on a last-second field goal in the second quarter. This is also just the second time this season that Notre Dame has trailed at the half. Like the offense, Penn State's defense did a lot of its work in the trenches. Despite having his left arm heavily wrapped, Penn State edge rusher Abdul Carter was a consistent presence in Notre Dame's backfield. He was one of five Penn State players with at least a half tackle for loss and also contributed one of Penn State's three sacks in the first half. To make matters worse for Notre Dame, more key injuries starting to mount. Quarterback Riley Leonard left the game late in the second quarter with an apparent head injury and his status for the second half is up in the air. Notre Dame also lost left tackle Anthonie Knapp and starting guard Rocco Spindler, which undoubtedly contributed to Penn State's dominance at the line of scrimmage. The blows keep mounting for Notre Dame, which is in a 10-0 hole near the end of the first half. Starting quarterback Riley Leonard just took another hit and went to Notre Dame's medical tent at the behest of the game officials. Backup quarterback Steve Angeli entered the game for Leonard, who was able to walk off the field under his own power. What a drive for Penn State. The Nittany Lions moved Notre Dame off of the ball to embark on a 15-play, 90-yard drive that took 7:17 off of the clock and ended with a 5-yard rushing touchdown from running back Nick Singleton. Penn State gathered 81 of those 90 yards on the ground, as Singleton and Kaytron Allen consistently carried the ball for gains of at least five yards. Tight end Tyler Warren also rushed for 21 yards and caught a screen pass for a first down on fourth-and-2 in the red zone. Penn State is in the midst of a dominant drive. The Nittany Lions have worked the ball all the way to the red zone behind a strong rushing effort. They are winning at the point of attack thus far, as running backs Kaytron Allen and Nick Singleton are consistently getting chunk gains to keep the chains moving. Tight end Tyler Warren has also factored heavily into the game plan. He converted a fourth-and-2 with a quick screen catch and also had an athletic run earlier in the drive that turned what looked like a big loss into a gain of nine. Notre Dame starting left tackle Anthonie Knapp was injured following a first-down run from quarterback Riley Leonard. It appeared as if Leonard fell on Knapp's legs as he was getting tackled. Knapp was slow to get up after the play and eventually fell to the turf before making it back to the huddle. He was taken to the locker room with the help of trainers. The Fighting Irish can hardly afford anymore injuries -- especially along the offensive line, where they entered the 2024 season shorthanded. Penn State just took an early lead off of a 20-yard field goal from kicker Ryan Barker, but the Nittany Lions definitely left points on the board. On third-and-goal from Notre Dame's 1-yard line, quarterback Drew Allar short-armed an easy throw in the flats to running back Nick Singleton, who was unable to make the catch. A better throw from Allar and Singleton would have walked into the end zone. Settling for the points was a smart move, though there may have been temptation to go for it. Penn State and Notre Dame are locked in a defensive battle after one quarter of play in the Orange Bowl. Moving the ball hasn't necessarily been an issue -- both teams have at least made it around midfield, and each has had decent chunk gains on offense -- but finishing drives has been an issue. It is a testament to the defensive strength in this matchup. Penn State has been especially impressive. The Nittany Lions forced a crucial turnover, courtesy of a Zakee Wheatley interception, near the end of the first quarter to set up a prime scoring opportunity. Though he has a heavy wrap on his left arm, Penn State edge rusher Abdul Carter is dominating the game early on. He already has one tackle and a couple of quick quarterback pressures -- one of which led to Penn State's interception -- as Notre Dame does not have an answer for him. In spite of the slug fest thus far, Penn State will have a prime scoring opportunity when the second quarter starts. The Nittany Lions face third-and-goal from Notre Dame's 1-yard line. Penn State is going to have favorable field position after the defense forced yet another turnover. On third-and-12 from Notre Dame's 33-yard line, Irish quarterback Riley Leonard tried to hit a wide receiver on a deep crossing route. But the ball sailed well over the intended receiver's head and Penn State defensive back Zakee Wheatley jumped into the air to snag the overthrow. The Nittany Lions will take over on their own 42-yard line with a premium chance to break the scoring seal. Penn State edge rusher Abdul Carter has been favoring his heavily wrapped left arm, but that hasn't stopped him from having a big impact on this game thus far. On Notre Dame's first offensive drive, he cut a quarterback run short with a quick tackle. Then, on the first play of the Irish's second drive, he ripped into the backfield and applied immediate pressure on Riley Leonard, who was forced to throw the ball away before Carter could meet him. He also got pressure on Leonard a couple plays later in the same drive, which resulted in Leonard throwing an interception. Carter still has explosiveness off the edge, even if one of his arms is clipped. Both Notre Dame and Penn State have had an opportunity to make an offensive impression, and each has achieved a nice chunk gain. For the Nittany Lions, quarterback Drew Allar completed a short pass to running back Nick Singleton for a gain of 23 yards. Notre Dame's explosive play came on a 32-yard connection between quarterback Riley Leonard and tight end Mitchell Evans, who made a nice catch with a defensive back draped all over him and picked up extra yardage while tip-toeing the sidelines. But in both instances, the drives stalled around midfield and ended with a punt. It could take a while for a breakthrough to happen. Penn State looked like it was building some early momentum, especially after a 23-yard completion to running back Nick Singleton out of the backfield, but Notre Dame's defense locked things down near midfield. A false start on Penn State gave the Nittany Lions third-and-14 and a short pass to Kaytron Allen came up well short of the sticks. It's worth watching how Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love looks when the Fighting Irish's offense takes the field. He's been dealing with a nagging knee injury, and he was sporting a brace as Notre Dame went through its pregame warm ups. Notre Dame won the toss and deferred its selection to the second half, which means that Penn State will start with the ball. In what's expected to be a low scoring, defensive battle, the Nittany Lions have an opportunity to set the tone with their scripted drive. Expect offensive coordinator Andy Kotelnicki to get creative with his play-calling to try and find weaknesses against an excellent Notre Dame defense. It seems like, at some point, all of the injuries will catch up to Notre Dame. The Irish are in an especially precarious position if Love can't play given what he means to the offense. Yet, Notre Dame has more than made do with its lot as the Irish have continued carving a path of dominance all the way through the postseason against teams deemed by the selection committee as worthy of playing for a national championship. Notre Dame's played dominant along the lines of scrimmage, and it has a proven winner at quarterback in Riley Leonard, who has literally put his body on the line to keep his team's hopes alive. I'm not going to pick against the Irish at this point; they've shown no signs of slowing down. Pick: Notre Dame -2.5 (-105) Notre Dame players and staff members are dealing with a \"flu or a virus\" ahead of Thursday night's College Football Playoff semifinal against Penn State, a school official confirmed in a statement to CBS Sports' Brandon Marcello. The statement downplayed the severity of the outbreak, which it says occurred over the past 10 days to two weeks, and maintains that it will not impact any availability for the Orange Bowl. \"It will have no impact on the game,\" Notre Dame's statement read. \"Beaux Collins was impacted in the Sugar Bowl, but still played and was on the mend during the game.\" © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

                "content": "When Mitch Jeter went out with injury earlier this season, Notre Dame was statistically the worst field goal kicking team in the nation. Let's just say the Irish will be kissing their clovers they have their kicker back. He drilled the 41 yarder to call game and send Notre Dame back to the National Championship. They will be looking to return the title back to South Bend for the first time since 1988, but before they set their sights either Texas or Ohio State, they will celebrate this Orange Bowl win. Penn States defense made a stop and gave Drew Allar and the offense a chance to win it late in the fourth quarter, but the Jr. QB who has thrown 53 touchdown and just 9 INTs in his career made the worst mistake you could possibly make in this situation and the rest is history. Allar went 12/23 for 135 yards, but his last throw was the biggest one of the game as Christian Gray set up ND in perfect position to win it. As always their fearless leader, Riley Leonard, rallied his guys and tied the game up with this 54 yard pass to Jaden Greathouse to took it all the way into the end zone and tied the game with under five minutes to go. Leonard ended the game with 223 yards 1 TD and 2 INTs on 15/23 passing, but he made the big plays when he needed to, and they needed this bomb to Greathouse to level things up late in the game. Allar was picked off in the end zone just a few played after the Leonard interception, but a pass interference penalty against the Irish gave Penn State a first down inside the 10 yard line and Singleton completed his hat trick of touchdowns as the Nittany Lions retook the lead. On the next play from scrimmage following Singleton's second TD run, Riley Leonard was picked off by Dani Dennis-Sutton and momentum completely shifted for Penn State who had a short field to work with after forcing the turnover. Losing the lead seemed to ignite the Nittany Lions as Drew Allar had a couple of long pass plays to set up this Singleton touchdown to set up a do or die last 10 minutes from Miami. ND seemingly had all the momentum ending the first half and starting the second. They scored 17 unanswered points to take the lead with this tough Jeremiyah Love TD run early in the fourth quarter. The Irish would finish the game with 115 yards rushing, and Love led the way with 45 yards on 11 carries. Notre Dame saw their starting QB and leader Riley Leonard take a big hit and get knocked out of the game for a drive and Steve Angeli came in and lead the team down the field and set up a field goal to get ND on the board. Coming out of the break, the Irish started to use the ground game, after having just 15 yards rushing in the first half. They ran it for 44 yards on this drive alone and that seemed to open up the passing game for the rest of the way. Leonard came back in the game after half and he tied the game up with a TD run to start the third quarter. The Nittany Lions offense went to the hurry up after taking the field goal lead and marched down the field on the shoulders of Nick Singleton who punched in his first of three TDs. The Notre Dame Fighting Irish are heading to the College Football Playoff National Championship after a dramatic ending from Miami as they took down the Penn State Nittany Lions in the Orange Bowl. Mitch Jeter kicked the winning field goal in a 27-24 game that went down to the wire. We didn't expect many fireworks between these two teams but that's exactly what we got. It took a little while for the offense to kick in, and what ignited it was a defensive play made by Penn State. That led to a Nittany Lion field goal after getting down to the one yard line but getting stopped on a goal to go situation. We'll get to the rest of the highlights in a second. But first, Mitch Jeter with the biggest kick of his life, and he drills it. Penn State made a big stop and had a chance to take the lead, but Allar's pass was picked by Christian Gray and that set up the Fighting Irish with a chance to win it in the last minute. Penn State tried the lateral play but the crossfield pass sails out of bounds and Notre Dame is heading to the National Championship!!!

ND get the ball back from their 19 and Pierce is swallowed up in the back field for a loss of 4. 2nd and 14 from the ND 15. After the pass interference call negated the ND INT, Singleton punches it in for his hat trick of TDs. This has been a game of momentum swings, and right now the Nittany Lions have all the momentum after tying up the game and picking off Leonard. Watch Dennis-Sutton drop back in coverage and make the pick to give his team the ball back with great field position. This was the first play from scrimmage after PENN State tied it up at 17-17.

After rushing for just 15 yards in the first half, the Fighting Irish ran it for 44 yards on their first drive out of the half-time break. Leonard got into the end zone, but it was Love and Williams to did the heavy lifting on that drive. Allen with the run to the left side and he is stopped at the line of scrimmage! 4th and 2 from the PSU 30 and they will punt with 8:30 to go in the 3rd quarter.

After a delay of game to start the quarter, Love picks up 6 yards on a run up the middle. 2nd and 9 from the ND 26. WE ARE BACK IN MIAMI FOR THE SECOND HALF OF ACTION!!! After scoring a field goal, Penn State started to go to a no huddle offense and that helped them drive down the field on a 90 yard, 15 play drive that took over seven minutes. The Nittany Lions have a total of 141 yards rushing with Kaytron Allen leading the way with 63 yards and Singleton right behind with 52 yards and this TD. Allar is 5/13 for 53 yards. ND got themselves in trouble on 3rd and long and Leonard forced a pass into traffic that was picked off by Wheatley, and the Irish took it all the way down the field to set up the first score of the game. PSU got down to the one yard line after the INT but had to settle for the field goal. Leonard struggled in that first half, going just 6/11 for 63 yards. He was hurt at the end of the half and Steve Angeli was able to drive his team down field and set up a field goal at the end of the second quarter.

As always the pre kickoff festivities are taking a little longer than usual, but it's coin flip time and the Fighting Irish win the toss and they differ to the second half. Penn State will start the CFP Semifinal with the ball. It all comes down to next Monday. The winner of tonight’s game and the winner of tomorrow’s Cotton Bowl will meet at Mercedes Benz Stadium for a chance at the CFP Nation Championship. The last time this game was played here in Atlanta was back in 2018 when the Alabama Crimson Tide beat the Georgia Bulldogs. Notre Dame has 11 titles, Penn State has two, Texas has four and Ohio State has eight. These are teams with massive championship pedigrees. Remember, this is just one of two CFP semifinals this week. After Notre Dame and Penn State duke it out tonight in Miami, the Texas Longhorns and the Ohio State Buckeyes will play tomorrow in the Cotton Bowl from Dallas. That will lead us into a two game NFL playoff slate on Saturday featuring the Chargers vs. Texans and Steeles vs. Ravens. Sunday we have the Broncos vs. Bills, Packers vs. Eagles and Commanders vs. Buccaneers. We will finish the football frenzy with a Monday Night match up between the Vikings and the Rams and remember you can follow all the action right here on AS English. This is the first time we have seen the 12 team playoff, and there is a lot to digest after the first few weeks. It’s tough for the NCAA to get everything right on the first attempt, and heading into the semifinals we see no teams that had a first round bye still alive in the CFP. The teams that were supposed to be favorites and have the advantage of getting the BYE week, looked rusty and were eventually knocked out. This will be Notre Dame and Penn State’s third game since the end of their “season” and it seems like these teams are back in midseason form after basically starting a new season three weeks ago. These playoffs have shown us rust is winning in the rust vs. rest debate. Penn State have one of the best one-two punches in the league with Kaytron Allen and Nicholas Singleton in their backfield. Both RBs have run for 1,000+ yards, with Allen rising for 10 yards more (1,026) but he has almost 50 carries more than Allen. Singleton is more of a dual threat back, having caught 39 passes fo 342 yards and five TDs through the air. Together they have 17 TDs on the ground and another 7 TDs receiving. This is a team that’ has a nice balance of their run and pass game, but over the last two games their defense has stepped up and allowed just 24 points in two games. There has been a lot of talk about Riley Leonard and his ability to lead his team and his will to win. The senior QB wasn’t up for any end of season awards for his quarterbacking play, but he is a winner. He threw for just 2,383 yards, 18 TDs and 6 INTs this season, but he is equally or even more dangerous with his feet. He’s got 831 yards rushing on the season and scored another 15 TDs with his feet, but the question is can he lead this offense tonight if Penn State stops the run and he has to pass the ball? He had just 90 yards passing against Georgia last week, but did throw a TD pass right before the half to swing the momentum in favor of ND, and ran for 80 yards. If the Irish are going to win, it’s going to come down to how their QB plays. The question coming into this game, and really all of head coach James Franklin’s time in South Bend is can he win the big one? After coming into the season ranked in the Top 10 in the nation, they won their first seven games but only one of them was against a ranked team, and that was No. 19 Illinois. They lost their first game to 4th ranked Ohio State 20-13 at the beginning of November, but then they won four straight to set up a meeting with the Oregon Ducks in the Big 10 Championship. They lost that game by a TD, and again the questions around Franklin started to surface. Wins over SMU and Boise State have given their coach a little leeway but now come the big big games. Notre Dame came into the season ranked in the top 10 in the preseason polls, but suffered a heartbreaking defeat to the Norther Illinois Huskies in their second game of the season after Mitch Jeter had his 62 yard game-winning field goal blocked as time ran out. Since then the Fighting Irish have been perfect. They have won 12 straight including but the question remains? Who have the Fighting Irish beat this year? They beat three ranked teams in the regular season none higher than 15th and beat an over achieving Indiana team in the first round of the playoffs before beating a Georgia team with a back up who had only thrown a handful of passes in his college career before last week’s game. After taking down SMU in the opening game of their playoff schedule, the Penn State Nittany Lions met Ashton Jenty and the Boise State Broncos. They contained the leading rusher in the country to just 104 yards on 30 carries, meanwhile Drew Allar threw two of his three TDs in the first quarter to take a 14-0 lead. Kaytron Allen and 134 yards on a day that Penn State ran for over 200 total yards and Nicholas Singleton capped the game with a 58 yard TD run to take a 31-14 lead with under 5:00 to go in the fourth quarter to set State up with a massive match up against Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl from Miami. After winning the battle for Indiana in a frigid South Bend to open their College Football Playoff slate, the fighting Irish met the Georgia Bulldogs who had won two of the last three CFP National Championships. With the Bulldogs’ starting QB Carson Beck out with injury they went to their back up Gunner Stockton and the Fighting Irish defense shut him down for most of the game. It was a low scoring first half until the final minute of the second quarter. Mitch Jeter kicked a field goal to put ND up 6-3, on the next play from scrimmage, Stockton was strip sacked by RJ Oben which led to a 13 yard TD pass from Riley Leonard to Beaux Collins to end the first half. The Fighting Irish got the ball to start the second half and Jayden Harrison took the kick off 98 yards for a TD and the Irish went from a 3-3 game with 43 seconds left in the first half to leading 20-3 fifteen seconds into the third quarter. They would hold off the Bulldogs and win 23-10 to reach the CFP semifinal tonight against Penn State. Hello everyone and welcome to Miami where two legendary teams are back fighting for the top prize in college football after years trying to keep up with the top dogs in the game. They have advanced through the first two games of the expanded college football playoff and now they are just a game away from the National Championship. Notre Dame has only lost one game all season and that was back in early September. If they want to get to the big game, they will have to extend either win streak tonight against a Penn State team that has dominated both of their playoff games after losing their Big Ten Championship to Oregon to end the regular season. The stage it set. Two of the best teams in the history of the college football, with a chance to get to the title game here from Miami. Sit back, relax and enjoy. We’ve got a throwback battle of two of the most historic, prolific schools in college football history tonight in the Capital One Orange Bowl. It’s been a long time since either of these two schools have been in the running for a National Championship but they have turned back the clock tonight one of them will punch their ticket to the College Football Playoff National Championship. It’s the Notre Dame Fighting Irish taking on the Penn State Nittany Lions in the CFP semifinal, and AS English will be with you all night providing live coverage, stats, highlights and analysis of tonight’s game form Hard Rock Stadium.",

                "content": "Nittany Lions conclude first trip to College Football Playoff with 27-24 defeat in semifinal round at the Capital One Orange Bowl MIAMI GARDENS, Fla.- The No. 6 seed Penn State Football team (13-3, 8-1) fell by a final score of 27-24 to No. 7 seed Notre Dame (14-1) on Thursday night in the CFP Semifinal at the Capital One Orange Bowl in Hard Rock Stadium. Penn State answered a 17-0 Notre Dame run with 14 in a row to take a 24-17 lead with under eight minutes to play but a Fighting Irish field goal with seven seconds left was the difference-maker in the Nittany Lions’ 27-24 defeat. Eight tackles for loss, including five sacks, by the Penn State defense held Notre Dame in check, while two interceptions led to 10 points by the Nittany Lion offense. Zakee Wheatley’s team-leading 16 total tackles tied the third-most ever recorded by a Nittany Lion in a Bowl/CFP game, and are the most in a Bowl/CFP game since Lance Mehl posted 17 in the 1979 Sugar Bowl. Wheatley also recorded a sack and an interception in a career outing. Kobe King also recorded nine stops of his own. Dani Dennis-Sutton collected two sacks and an interception, the second of his career, in an outstanding defensive performance. The aforementioned Wheatley, along with Coziah Izzard and Abdul Carter recorded the other three Nittany Lion sacks. Nicholas Singleton became the second player in Penn State history to record three rushing touchdowns in a Bowl/CFP game. He joined Ki-Jana Carter, who ran three in during the 1995 Rose Bowl, in the historic club. Singleton finished with 84 yards and three scores on 15 carries while fellow back Kaytron Allen rushed 19 times for 82 yards. Tight end Tyler Warren wrapped up his record-setting campaign with 75 receiving yards on six catches, while also rushing twice for 21 yards. Warren was once again quarterback Drew Allar’s favorite target. Allar completed 12 of 23 passes for 135 yards. HOW IT HAPPENED An interception by Wheatley on Notre Dame’s second drive of the game gave Penn State’s offense possession at its own 42-yard line. The Nittany Lions converted a fourth down on their way to their first points of the ballgame. A 20-yard field goal by Ryan Barker put Penn State on the board as time expired in the first quarter. Penn State converted another fourth down in the red zone as it recorded the first touchdown of the ballgame. A 15-play, 90-yard drive that chewed up 7:17 of clock was capped off by a five-yard rushing score by Singleton as the Nittany Lions went up 10-0 on the Fighting Irish with 2:18 remaining in the second quarter. Notre Dame kicked a 41-yard field goal as time expired in the first half to make the score 10-3 in favor of Penn State at the halftime break. Yielding just 15 rushing yards and posting four tackles for loss, including three sacks, the Penn State defense kept Notre Dame in check in the first half. Notre Dame evened the score with a touchdown drive to open the second half. Riley Leonard scored the first touchdown of the game for the opposition on a three-yard run at the end of an eight-play, 75-yard drive. A two-yard touchdown run by the Irish put them up 17-10 with 14:07 on the clock in the fourth quarter. Notre Dame took its first lead of the game on a 10-play, 72-yard scoring drive. Penn State responded with a touchdown drive of its own, ending the 17-0 run by the Irish, tying the game at 17. Singleton scored his second rushing touchdown of the day, this time from seven yards out at the end of a seven-play, 75-yard drive. Allar completed two 20-plus yard pass plays on the drive to push Penn State down the field, going to tight ends Warren and Khalil Dinkins. An interception by Dennis-Sutton on the first play of Notre Dame’s ensuing drive put the offense back on the field on the Irish 39-yard line. Singleton’s third rushing touchdown of the game, another seven-yard scamper, put the Nittany Lions back on top at 24-17 with 7:55 left in the fourth quarter. Penn State traveled 39 yards on five plays for the go-ahead tally, capitalizing on another Notre Dame turnover. Notre Dame knotted the score at 24 with a 54-yard touchdown on its next drive. The Fighting Irish took seven plays to go 81 yards for the game-tying score. The Fighting Irish added a 41-yard field goal with seven seconds on the clock to take a 27-24 lead. A last-ditch effort by the Nittany Lions was not successful and Penn State fell 27-24. The 2024 Penn State football season is presented by PSECU. © 2024 Penn State Nittany Lions",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. ARLINGTON, Texas -- Ohio State outlasted Texas 28-14 to win the Cotton Bowl and clinch their first trip to the College Football Playoff National Championship since 2014. The Buckeyes will face 7-seed Notre Dame at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta on Jan. 20 in search of their first national championship in a decade. Texas got the ball to the edge of the goal line with only minutes remaining in the fourth quarter and had five plays to get it into the end zone. On a pivotal fourth down Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers dropped back to pass, but Ohio State defensive end Jack Sawyer strip-sacked Ewers and returned it more than 80 yards for a touchdown. The Longhorns had one more drive, but Ewers threw an interception to safety Caleb Downs to end the game and send Ohio State to the national title game. Despite the offensive talent between these two programs, the defenses dominated the matchup. Texas forced an interception off quarterback Will Howard and sacked him twice. Ohio State posted nine tackles for loss and four sacks in the big win, including three tackles for loss from linebacker Sonny Styles. Texas blanketed wide receiver Jeremiah Smith and held him to only three yards on three targets. In his place, Carnell Tate stepped up with seven catches for 87 yards. Three first half drives were derailed by penalties, but the Buckeyes made just enough plays to step up and win. Ewers threw for 283 yards and two touchdowns in what is expected to be his final career game at Texas. Ultimately, the Longhorns leave for the second year in a row wondering what could have been. CBS Sports was here throughout with updates, highlights and analysis. Read on below for takeaways from Ohio State's dramatic win over Texas. Texas managed to take away Jeremiah Smith. The Buckeyes are down two starting linemen for the season. At one point, defensive end J.T. Tuimoloau went out with an injury. None of it mattered. Ohio State's championship depth shone through. With Smith blanketed, the Buckeyes simply looked to No. 2 receiver Emeka Egbuka, who finished with five catches for 51 yards. When he faced pressure, No. 3 receiver Carnell Tate stepped up and had one of the biggest games of his young career with seven catches for 87 yards. Even when Ohio State gave up the first touchdown of the game, running back TreVeyon Henderson took a screen pass 75 yards for a touchdown. Ultimately, that's the challenge that comes with playing Ohio State. It has a roster filled with players who can change the game in an instant. Even in the semifinal round of the College Football Playoff, no one can seriously match the Buckeyes depth. Ohio State defensive end Jack Sawyer was a top-five national recruit, but never quite lived up to national-caliber ability -- until the College Football Playoff. With a game-deciding strip-sack, Sawyer's legendary CFP added yet another chapter. Sawyer finished with three tackles, a sack, two pass breakups, two quarterback hurries and the strip-sack for a touchdown in the win. In the playoff alone, Sawyer is up to 4.5 sacks. He has emerged as the physical and emotional leader of the defense as the Buckeyes prepare to play for a national championship. Texas was rated among the best defenses in college football all season, but the Longhorns flexed their muscles against Ohio State's highly-ranked offense. The Longhorns blanketed wide receiver Jeremiah Smith from the start and held him to only three targets and one catch. From an aerial view, defensive coordinator Pete Kwiatkowski passed off coverages and used pass rushers to block passing lanes and make the quick passing game ineffective. The Longhorns' defensive line also had real success against a high-powered Ohio State offense, holding the Buckeyes to only 3.4 yards per carry and 78 yards from the running backs. The performance will get lost to history, but the Texas unit was one of the best in the sport. Ohio State outlasted Texas 28-14 to win the Cotton Bowl and clinch their first trip to the College Football Playoff National Championship since 2014. The Buckeyes will face 7-seed Notre Dame at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta on Jan. 20 in search of their first national championship in a decade. Texas got the ball to the edge of the goal line with only minutes remaining in the fourth quarter and had five plays to get the ball into the end zone. On a pivotal fourth down, Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers dropped back to pass, but Ohio State defensive end Jack Sawyer strip-sacked Ewers and returned it more than 80 yards for a touchdown. The Longhorns had one more drive, but Ewers threw an interception to safety Caleb Downs to end the game and send Ohio State to a victory.

Texas blanketed wide receiver Jeremiah Smith and held him to only three yards on three targets. In his place, Carnell Tate stepped up with seven catches for 87 yards. Three first half drives were derailed by penalties, but the Buckeyes made just enough plays to step up and win. Ewers threw for 283 yards and two touchdowns in what is expected to be his final career game at Texas. Ultimately, the Longhorns leave for the second year in a row wondering what could have been. Jack Sawyer's fumble recovery and fumble recovery for a touchdown are the longest in College Football Playoff history, eclipsing the 58-yard fumble return touchdown by Oregon's Tony Washington against Florida State in the Rose Bowl in 2014-15. Ohio State defensive end Jack Sawyer got the pressure on Quinn Ewers on 4th and Goal, and when the Texas quarterback dropped the ball he picked it up and ran it 83 yards the other way for a lead-extending touchdown for the Buckeyes. The Longhorns had moved the ball effectively thanks to a long Gunner Helm reception and a big throw from Ewers to Golden, but with the season on the line and the ball at the 2-yard line the Buckeyes not only get a stop but extend their lead with 2:13 remaining. We have seen some epic endings in this first year of the expanded College Football Playoff, but Sawyer's pressure, scoop and score will be one that's remembered for a long time. Ohio State coach Ryan Day made one of his first risky calls of the game by going for it on a lengthy fourth-and-two against a Texas defensive line that was dominating. Chip Kelly dialed up a quarterback draw that went for 18 yards and helped set up a two-yard touchdown run by Quinshon Judkins. Ohio State recommitted to the run on the drive and traveled 87 yards in 12 plays. The Buckeyes have been bogged down by penalties, but the unit was able to withstand a false start by Josh Fryar. Now, they're seven minutes away from heading to the national championship game. Texas has tied the game entering the fourth quarter after a legendary drive from quarterback Quinn Ewers got the Longhorns into the end zone for the second time. Ewers led four third-down conversions, including a toss to Quintrevion Wisner on third down for a miraculous third-and-10 conversion. Ohio State continued to shoot itself in the foot with penalties and mistakes. On the most recent drive, an offensive lineman committed an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on a run to push the Buckeyes back. Four drives have been stifled by penalties, erasing the Buckeyes' yards and yards per play advantage. The defenses have owned the game with 10 combined tackles for loss and five sacks. The winner of the Cotton Bowl will face off against Notre Dame in the College Football Playoff National Championship on Jan. 20. Texas hasn't run the ball consistently all night, but the running backs took a starring role thanks to a mix of check downs and downhill rushes to get back into the end zone for the second time. Quinn Ewers' third down toss to Quintrevion Wisner for a first down was a game-changing play. Fourteen yards rushing from Wisner didn't change the game, but it made the Buckeyes think. The rushing success helped set up a 26-yard pass to Jaydon Blue, his second score of the game. The Buckeyes have dominated third quarters this season. The Longhorns have struggled. In this moment, Texas flipped the script and tied the game. Facing a key third-and-10, Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers pulled off a silly conversion to keep the drive alive. Ewers was pressured immediately and while being dragged down, tossed the ball to running back Quintrevion Wisner, who rumbled forward for a first down. The play was reviewed to see if Ewers' knee was down, but he got it off just in time. Ohio State quarterback Will Howard tried to force the ball to Jeremiah Smith in triple-coverage and the Texas defense made them pay. Linebacker David Gbenda stepped up and pulled down a pivotal interception to give Texas the ball in great position. In an instant, Texas stole momentum back. Ohio State took a 14-7 lead against Texas into the half after running back TreVeyon Henderson took a well-placed screen pass 75 yards for a game-changing touchdown. The score was the first for Ohio State since the opening drive of the game and is a dagger for the Longhorns as the Buckeyes get the ball to start the second half. Texas cut the Ohio State lead after a pair of key plays late in the first half helped set up points. Backup quarterback Arch Manning entered the game on fourth-and-1 and delivered an 8-yard speed option, and receiver Silas Bolden broke a tackle to key off a 24-yard reception to set up a field goal before the end of the half. The plays helped set up an 18-yard touchdown pass from Quinn Ewers to Jaydon Blue. The Buckeyes dominated much of the first half, but offensive penalties loomed large. Three Ohio State drives were extinguished by them, including two holding calls and an unsportsmanlike conduct by Henderson. Texas looked to have captured momentum right before the break, but Henderson's big play wrestled control back to the Buckeyes. Texas running back Quintreveon Wisner posted 33 yards rushing on 4.1 yards per carry in the half, but Ewers was sacked three times. The Texas defense forced the first sack of Ohio State in the College Football Playoff and held the Buckeyes to only 36 yards on the ground. After missing two field goals in the final minutes of regulation against Arizona State to force overtime in the Peach Bowl, longtime Texas kicker Bert Auburn appears to be benched. Instead, backup Will Stone came into the game to kick the extra point on the Texas touchdown. After a much maligned first half, the Texas offense delivered in the biggest spot near the end of the first half. Quarterback Quinn Ewers delivered a perfectly-placed 18-yard touchdown pass over the top to Jaydon Blue to put up the first points of the game, a much-needed swing as Ohio State gets the ball to start the second half. Texas quarterback Arch Manning entered the game for the first time on first-and-one. Manning ran a speed option and broke through for a key first down with less than a minute remaining in the half. The Longhorns have only 31 yards rushing in the first half, making Manning's eight-yard scamper even more vital. Frankly, Ohio State has dominated Texas. They've nearly doubled them in yardage and are averaging 6.5 yards per play to Texas's 4.2. And yet, the score remains only 7-0 because Ohio State penalties are killing them offensively. There was the unsportsmanlike conduct by TreVeyon Henderson. Gee Scott was called for holding. Josh Fryar held. Each killed a drive and put the Buckeyes behind the chains. In total, Ohio State has been called for four penalties for 40 yards. Texas has only committed two for 17. The penalties hang large. Ohio State defensive end J.T. Tuimoloau went out with an apparent injury in the second quarter. Tuimoloau was shaken up on the field and had to go to the injury tent. Early in the game, Tuimoloau has already been dominant with 1.5 sacks and several other quarterback pressures against an overmatched Texas front. Texas wide receiver Matthew Golden returned to the sideline without his helmet and does not appear likely to return to the game. Golden went to the injury tent and came back with his ankles retaped. After returning briefly, he went to the locker room with trainers. With Golden out, expect Texas to try and target freshman Ryan Wingo more. He's one of the only healthy pass-catchers remaining. Texas's offensive line is getting whipped and Ohio State is bringing pressure from everywhere. The Longhorns have given up four tackles for loss and there sacks in the early going, including two tackles for loss from linebacker Sonny Styles. Texas has coughed up three fumbles and is lucky that all were recovered by the offense. After the most recent drive, top receiver Matthew Golden went to the locker room. Golden previously needed to get his ankles retaped. If Golden is hurt, a banged up Isaiah Bond is the only receiver on the roster with more than 500 yards receiving. Ohio State leads Texas 7-0 at the end of the first quarter as the Longhorns have missed opportunities. The Buckeyes have moved down the field at will, posting 117 yards and averaging 6.9 yards per play against the top defense in college football. With Jeremiah Smith blanketed, second and third receivers Emeka Egbuka and Carnell Tate have combined for 57 yards on five catches. Texas had chances to push its way into the game, including a 22-yard reception from receiver Ryan Wingo that was only stopped with a shoestring tackle. However, the Longhorns allowed two early sacks as Ohio State dominated the trenches on both sides. Ohio State outscored opponents by a combined 35-0 in the first two rounds of the College Football Playoff. A 7-0 advantage is manageable, especially after the Longhorns got a third down stop to end the period. Still, Texas has work to do. Texas will look back on a 22-yard reception to Ryan Wingo as a moment that the game could have gone differently. Wingo caught the ball with plenty of space and seemed to be able to take off for a potential touchdown. Instead, Ohio State safety Caleb Downs came down and narrowly caught him by the shoelaces for a tackle. Texas ultimately had a false start and allowed a sack to kill what was a promising drive in plus territory. That's two drives for Texas. Quinn Ewers has 65 yards. Neither ended with points. The Buckeyes are using motion to force adjustments by the Texas secondary to cover Jeremiah Smith. Ohio State used to to open up the complementary receivers and running game and march down the field with ease for a 64-yard touchdown drive in 10 plays. Receiver Emeka Egbuka had 30 yards on the play and running back Quinshon Judkins broke through for a nine-yard touchdown run. Ohio State had two serious receiving touchdown opportunities -- a missed throw by Will Howard to Jeremiah Smith and a drop by Carnell Tate. It didn't matter. Texas is arguably the best defense in college football, and the Buckeyes put them in the blender. Texas had some solid plays on their opening script, including a nasty play action that freed up a 4-yard pass to Juan Davis. However, facing third-and-4, Texas ran once and passed once before turning it over on downs. Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers tried to force a tight pass to DeAndre Moore, but it fell incomplete. Texas will get first crack at the game on offense and the Longhorns need to start fast. Ohio State jumped out to a 34-0 lead against Oregon and 21-0 lead against Tennessee, both of which proved fatal in games that were decided by a combined 45 points. The Longhorns scored 14 points after one drive against Arizona State; they similarly need to throw the first punch. Texas has put together a solid season and is surely one of the best teams in the country. But if Ohio State's transformation over the last two weeks is permanent, the Buckeyes are the best team in the country. The Longhorns will be able to cause problems for Ohio State's passing game, but their offense simply won't be able to put up points in a battle of two elite defenses. The Buckeyes will outlast the 'Horns and move on to the CFP National Championship. Pick: Ohio State -5.5 Texas vs. Ohio State game prediction, picks, 2025 Cotton Bowl odds, spread, where to watch, TV channel There's always a lot on the line when Ohio State and Texas take the field, and Friday evening is no exception. The (8) Buckeyes and (5) Longhorns are set to face off in the Cotton Bowl, with a trip to the College Football Playoff National Championship on the line. There's no denying that Texas and Ohio State boast two of the top rosters in college football, but which one actually has the edge when analyzing specific positions? 2025 Cotton Bowl, Ohio State vs. Texas: Who has the edge in College Football Playoff semifinal game? Four months isn't a long time. But that won't stop Quinn Ewers' four months in Columbus from being an overarching storyline of the 2025 Cotton Bowl, which will pit No. 8-seed Ohio State against (5) Texas in the semifinals of the College Football Playoffs. Ewers, if you aren't aware by now, reclassified from the 2022 class to the 2021 class in August of 2021 to enroll at Ohio State. He had an uneventful few months on the field, but, in many ways, became a transformational trendsetter in the NIL space with the move. Ahead of the Cotton Bowl, let's revisit Ewers' time in Columbus and what led to that brief marriage in the first place. A million-dollar spread of NIL deals spurred Quinn Ewers to Ohio State early, but staying never made sense The Cotton Bowl pits two of college football's most iconic brands against each other as Ohio State and Texas will tangle Friday night for a spot in the College Football Playoff National Championship. Texas claims four national championships and Ohio State claims eight. But the historic powers have only met three times previously and never in a postseason game with such high stakes. The CFP semifinal showdown will mark the first meeting since the 2009 Fiesta Bowl. Ohio State vs. Texas history is limited, but College Football Playoff foes have played for high stakes before It's easy to be a Batman in college football, getting all the targets and attention. It's much more difficult to be Robin, to put aside your own production for the good of the team. Ohio State wide receiver Emeka Egbuka ranks among the best Robins ever, and has the Buckeyes on the precipice of a national title. \"When culture is strong through the leaders, it permeates throughout the rest of the team,\" Egbuka said. \"When you see it from the top down to the younger guys, it speaks volumes and reflects the character of the leaders.\" Not everyone can be Batman: Ohio State's crew of overqualified Robins, like Emeka Egbuka, embrace their role Texas doesn't spend much time as an underdog in college football as one of the most historic blue bloods in the sport. But on Friday at the Cotton Bowl, the Longhorns are heavy underdogs against Ohio State. CBS Sports' Dennis Dodd spoke to the legendary Mack Brown about how to manage underdog status. \"You latch onto anything you can to find an edge,\" Brown said. \"I mean, the least bit you can get. At Texas, one of the keys to that job is trying to get your guys every week because it's hard to do, because everybody is telling you how great you are. You're usually the pick. You have to just motivate yourself.\" In rare underdog role vs. Ohio State in Cotton Bowl, Texas embraces type of edge Mack Brown once perfected © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

SN's PLAYOFF HQ: Live CFP scores | Updated CFP bracket | Full CFP schedule (All times ET) 10:54 p.m. — TOUCHDOWN: OHIO STATE SCOOP-AND-SCORE! On fourth-and-goal, Ewers gets strip sacked by Jack Sawyer and it's returned for a touchdown. What a shift in momentum—Texas was down to OSU's 1-yardline! JACK SAWYER SCOOP-AND-SCORE 😱Ohio State is one step closer to advancing to the national championship! pic.twitter.com/BPoV5FBRGZ 10:52 p.m. — Oh man, Ohio State's defense gets flagged for back-to-back pass interference penalties in the end zone. Texas is on the OSU 1. 10:48 p.m. — Texas is responding nicely, and the Longhorns are already in Ohio State territory. Matthew Golden returns from the sidelines and makes a huge grab from Ewers, getting this offense down to the Buckeyes' 13. 10:44 p.m — TOUCHDOWN: Quinshon Judkins takes it in for the one-yard touchdown. Ohio State takes back the lead again, and a hell of a drive by the Buckeyes. Let's see how Texas responds. 10:41 p.m. — On 4th-and-2, Ohio State calls Will Howard's number and he takes it up the gut untouched on quarterback power for a first down. WHAT A CALL BY @TimTebowFIRST DAHN OHIO STATE #PMSCFPESPN2 pic.twitter.com/wXbVkq3uYr 10:37 p.m. — Oof, a costly Ohio State false start penalty gave the Buckeyes a 3rd-and-9 attempt instead of a 3rd-and-4. Buckeyes will go for this on 4th-and-2. Ohio State has seven penalties for 70 yards on the night. 10:30 p.m. Will Howard hits Carnell Tate on 3rd-and-5 for 18 yards and a first down. Nice drive for the Buckeyes here so far. 10:28 p.m. — Ohio State gets the ball back following a Texas three-and-out. Texas' Malik Muhammad gets flagged for a pass interference on the very first play. 10:21 p.m. — What a stand by this Longhorn defense. Will Howard had a pass batted down on 3rd-and-15, and was sacked for a loss of 10 yards earlier. Ohio State has to punt and Texas gets the ball back. 10:16 p.m. — Jeremiah Smith still has just the one reception on the night. Let's see if Ohio State tries to target him on this next drive to get him going. 10:10 p.m. — TOUCHDOWN: Quinn Ewers hits Jaydon Blue for a 26-yard touchdown pass, and its his second of the night. All tied up folks! JAYDON BLUE AGAIN ‼️Texas and Ohio State are tied at 14.pic.twitter.com/e4dVsOSmj6 10:08 p.m. — Texas has a great drive going here, and the Longhorns are running the ball well. Longhorns are down to Ohio State's 26. 10:04 p.m. — Oh man, what an improv job by Quinn Ewers! It looks like he is about to get sacked by Jack Sawyer, but he flips it to Quintrevion Wisner, who takes it 14 yards for a first down. What a play by Ewers there. QUINN EWERS MAKES A PASS AS HE'S FALLING 😱Huge first down for Texas.#CFBPlayoff pic.twitter.com/f73NrwnVj9 9:58 p.m. — Huge stand by the Longhorn defense, forcing an Ohio State three-and-out. Texas' defense stuffed Quinshon Judkins on the 3rd-and-1 attempt. Questionable playcall there from Ohio State—Ryan Day called Judkins on a sweep around the left side that Texas snuffed out immediately. 9:54 p.m. — Texas punts following that Howard interception, giving Ohio State the ball back. 9:52 p.m. —Although Texas receiver Matthew Golden hasn't been ruled officially out, it looks doubtful he'll come back in. ESPN's Laura Rutledge reported that Golden came out of the locker room and tried running full speed, but kept shaking his head. He's still dressed on Texas' sideline, though. 9:48 p.m. — Well, that's one way to respond, Texas! Will Howard throws a pick on his first drive of the second half. Will Howard INT pic.twitter.com/qTUWVyRVkl Let's see how the Longhorns respond on offense here. Ohio State had a nice drive going there, too. 9:41 p.m. — The second half should be getting underway here shortly. Remember, OSU won the toss and deferred to the second half, so it'll be Ohio State's ball first. 9:23 p.m. — What a first half! Texas has just 133 yards of total offense, and has gone 1-for-7 on third down. Ohio State, meanwhile, has 236 total yards, 200 of those from Will Howard. The most shocking statistic of the night? Jeremiah Smith has just one reception for three yards. 9:16 p.m. — TOUCHDOWN: Oh my, things have changed real quick! On Ohio State's very first play of the next drive, Will Howard finds TreVeyon Henderson for a 75-yard for a touchdown. What a response! TREVEYON HENDERSON IS GONE 💨75-yard touchdown right before halftime.pic.twitter.com/vaPLwh6W7W This sums up how Texas fans felt about that one: When you got more on Texas than your wife would approve pic.twitter.com/UfKIc8qIAB 9:13 p.m. —TOUCHDOWN: Quinn Ewers finds Jaydon Blue for an 18-yard touchdown pass. We got a game, folks! Quinn Ewers connects with Jaydon Blue with less than a minute to go in the first half! 🤘 pic.twitter.com/yebDd5VMGr 9:08 p.m. — Arch Manning comes into the game and converts it on 4th-and-1! Although the ball popped out at the end and recovered by Ohio State, the refs rule he was down. 9:06 p.m. — The refs are taking a look at the spot on a Quinn Ewers scramble here. Looks like he was short of the first down, and the refs rule that he was. 4th-and-1 here from the 50. 8:59 p.m. — Texas' Anthony Hill Jr. and Barryn Sorrell sack Will Howard on third down, a nice stop for the Longhorns. Texas' defense has also limited Jeremiah Smith to just one catch for three yards tonight so far. Texas has been playing multiple defenders on Jeremiah Smith all game and keeping safeties high to prevent Ohio State from getting anything big downfield.Defensive line has stepped up the last few drives too. Texas really needs some points here before halftime. 8:55 p.m. — Oh man, Isaiah Bond drops what would have been a Texas first down, he was wide open too. Let's see if the Longhorns can hold Ohio State in the final 3:23 of this half. 8:53 p.m. — Looks like Texas' Matthew Golden still hasn't been cleared to go back in this game. He's seen on the sidelines with his helmet in his hands. 8:49 p.m. — Ohio State is forced to punt after a drive that has holding and false start penalties that backed the Buckeyes up. Texas holding Ohio State to just seven so far is a win for this Longhorn defense. 8:45 p.m. — J.T. Tuimoloau is shown on the sideline with a heavily taped left ankle and is trying to warm up, but ESPN's Holly Rowe reports that he is in some pain. As for Howard's golf-ball hand injury, it looks like this might've been the hit to cause it: Howard hitting his hand on a facemask thought to be responsible for that lump on his hand pic.twitter.com/6Q1XmvrVxg 8:42 p.m. — Ohio State gets away with a pass interference penalty on third down that should have been called. Meanwhile, Buckeyes EDGE rusher J.T. Tuimoloau has gone into the injury tent after limping off the field. 8:38 p.m. — Texas is facing a 3rd-and-6 from its own territory. Longhorns could use some momentum here as the clock is winding down in the first half. Steve Sarkisian wanted a targeting call on a hit on Gunnar Helm, but he didn't get it. Here's that play: GUNNAR HELM TAKES A MASSIVE SHOT FROM SONNY STYLES.. THAT WAS A #RAMTRUCKED #PMSCFPESPN2 pic.twitter.com/rXo3olUSqg 8:30 p.m. — Texas forces an Ohio State punt as Will Howard's 3rd-and-8 pass to Emeka Egbuka fall incomplete. Speaking of Howard, it looks like he has a gnarly bump on his non-throwing hand. Something to monitor for sure, but it doesn't appear to be affecting him too much. Does not look good on Will Howard hand pic.twitter.com/lUl44zu4kr Longhorns receiver Matthew Golden is back on Texas' sideline, as well. 8:24 p.m. — Wow, Ohio State is going after the ball. On third down, the Buckeyes bring pressure and Ewers gets sacked, fumbling the football. Luckily his lineman recovers it. Crisis averted, for now, but unfortunately, Matthew Golden is headed to the locker room with an ankle injury: Golden now heading to the Texas locker room accompanied by UT trainers.

Read more on President-elect Donald Trump’s transition here. The Trump Organization on Friday announced President-elect Donald Trump will not have any involvement in managing his real estate and branding empire during his second term and appointed an outside ethics adviser to monitor major company actions. It’s part of several measures the organization said it was taking to avoid conflicts of interest as Trump prepares to return to the White House later this month. The provisions, for the most part, mirror steps announced during the first Trump administration. Under its plan, the company pledged not to enter into any new deals with foreign governments and voluntarily donate to the US Treasury any profits from foreign governments that it can identify flowing into its hotels and other properties. The ethics pledge, however, is silent on how the company will handle overseas business deals. And Trump’s son Eric Trump, the company’s executive vice president, has previously said that the firm will continue to pursue foreign business during his father’s second term, relaxing a self-imposed restriction that the company has said was in place during the first term. In a statement, the Trump Organization noted that the incoming president is not required either by federal law or the US Constitution to remove himself from his business interests. Even so, Eric Trump said, the company “is dedicated to not just meeting but vastly exceeding its legal and ethical obligations during my father’s Presidency.” Read more about the Trump Organization’s pledge. A number of President-elect Donald Trump’s Cabinet picks are expected to get confirmation hearings next week before the Senate. Here’s what has been scheduled so far: Tuesday, January 14: Wednesday, January 15 Thursday, January 16 President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to serve as director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, is voicing support for a key government surveillance authority she once sought to dismantle. The shift comes amid lingering uncertainty about Gabbard’s path to confirmation despite spending the last several weeks meeting with senators on both sides of the aisle in an effort to win their support. In a new statement to CNN on Friday, Gabbard said she will support FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) Section 702 — an intelligence gathering tool passed by Congress after September 11, 2001 — if confirmed as Trump’s spy chief, marking a dramatic shift from her previous attempts to repeal the same authority and comments raising deep concerns about domestic surveillance. “Section 702, unlike other FISA authorities, is crucial for gathering foreign intelligence on non-U.S. persons abroad. This unique capability cannot be replicated and must be safeguarded to protect our nation while ensuring the civil liberties of Americans,” Gabbard said in the statement to CNN. “My prior concerns about FISA were based on insufficient protections for civil liberties, particularly regarding the FBI’s misuse of warrantless search powers on American citizens. Significant FISA reforms have been enacted since my time in Congress to address these issues. If confirmed as DNI, I will uphold Americans’ Fourth Amendment rights while maintaining vital national security tools like Section 702 to ensure the safety and freedom of the American people,” she added. Gabbard also met Friday with the current director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, according to a source familiar with the matter, who declined to provide additional details about what was discussed. The meeting comes as Trump was sentenced to unconditional discharge for his conviction last year on 34 charges of business fraud related to hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential campaign. Punchbowl was first to report Gabbard’s statement regarding FISA Section 702. Read more about the scrutiny that Gabbard faces. President-elect Donald Trump was sentenced today after his conviction last year on 34 charges of business fraud related to hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential campaign. Judge Juan Merchan sentenced Trump to unconditional discharge. The sentencing, which was expected, means Trump will remain a felon but faces no jail time, penalties or probation for his conviction in the hush money case. Merchan said that “never before has this court been presented with such a unique and remarkable set of circumstance.” Friday’s sentencing cements the fact that Trump will be the first convicted felon to become president. Here’s what happened in court on Friday: Prosecutor’s recommendation: Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass recommended a sentence of unconditional discharge for Trump. “Your honor indicated an inclination to impose an unconditional discharge under all the circumstances of this case, this unique posture and the defendant’s status as president-elect, the people recommend a sentence of unconditional discharge,” he said. Steinglass listed off things he said Trump has done post-verdict to undermine the jury’s verdict, while Trump leaned back in his chair and folded his arms, shaking his head side to side. The prosecutor told the court that Trump has been “far from expressing any kind of remorse for his criminal conduct” and “encouraged others to reject the jury verdict.” He acknowledged that any other conditional discharge has the potential to interfere with Trump’s obligations to the office of the presidency, saying in court, “We must be respectful of the office of the presidency” and his pending inauguration. Plans to appeal verdict: Following Steinglass’ comments in court, Trump attorney Todd Blanche said, “A lot of what the government just said presupposes that this case is legally appropriate,” while noting that Trump’s lawyers intend to appeal the verdict. Blanche, who is Trump’s pick for deputy attorney general, argued for the president-elect, saying he disagrees with prosecutors, while Trump looked forward without reacting to what his attorney was saying to the judge. “I very, very much disagree with much of what the government just said about this case, about the legitimacy of what happened in this courtroom during the trial, and about President Trump’s conduct fighting this case,” Blanche said. Trump’s statement: Trump began his statement at today’s hearing saying that “this has been a very terrible experience” and insisted he is innocent. “It’s been a political witch hunt, it was done to damage my reputation,” Trump said. Trump went after the indictment and the charges of falsifying business records — after he chose not to testify at the trial. He said legal fees were not put down by him, but by his accountants. The president-elect also discussed his 2024 election victory, saying in court that he won the popular vote by “millions and millions of votes.” Trump also released a statement via social media, calling the sentencing “a despicable charade.” Listen to the hearing: The court released audio of the proceedings shortly after today’s hearing. Listen to Trump and Judge Juan Merchan in the recording here. How we got here: The president-elect successfully used the courts to delay the hearing, which was originally set for July, and urged the US Supreme Court to pause his sentencing in the case — a highly unusual request that relies in part on the court’s decision last year to grant him broad immunity from criminal prosecution. On Thursday, the high court rejected Trump’s emergency request to delay the sentencing. President-elect Donald Trump was sentenced to unconditional discharge this morning for his conviction last year on 34 charges of business fraud related to a hush money payment to Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential campaign. To put it simply: Unconditional discharge means Trump will not be imprisoned, fined or face probation. However, his conviction still stands, and he will enter office as a convicted felon. Prosecutors had recommended the sentence, saying in court Friday, “we must be respectful of the office of the presidency” and Trump’s pending inauguration. Trump has vowed to keep fighting the conviction through the appeals courts. CNN’s Kara Scannell, who has been inside the courtroom throughout President-elect Donald Trump’s hush money trial, said that the trial today was different from other court appearances because the public was able to hear from Judge Juan Merchan. “One thing that you never hear from, the public never hears from, is the judge. So for the first time today, the public was able to see the demeanor of Judge Juan Merchan. Trump has launched numerous attacks throughout the course of this trial, and you were able to hear Merchan’s demeanor,” Scannell said. She continued, “That is the tone he carried throughout this entire trial, even while Trump was making statements about Merchan and his family in the hallways. The person, the voice you heard on the bench today, is the judge who presided over this case, keeping an even keel. And, as you could hear, being very judicious in his statements and thoughtful on them.” Scannell also painted a picture of what the courtroom looked like from her point of view. “When Trump did speak, it was that image of him side by side with his attorney that we, the members of the media, saw in there and the members of the public that were allowed into the courtroom. The judge was looking at that screen as Trump was giving his statement. And then when the judge handed down his sentence, he was directing his attention fully to that screen, looking directly at it, speaking to Donald Trump,” Scannell described. President-elect Donald Trump responded to his hush money sentencing in a post on Truth Social, railing against Democrats and promising to appeal. “The Radical Democrats have lost another pathetic, unAmerican Witch Hunt,” he said in the post. Trump argued “there was never a case.” “The real Jury, the American People, have spoken, by Re-Electing me with an overwhelming MANDATE in one of the most consequential Elections in History. As the American People have seen, this ‘case’ had no crime, no damages, no proof, no facts, no Law, only a highly conflicted Judge, a star witness who is a disbarred, disgraced, serial perjurer, and criminal Election Interference,” Trump said. “Today’s event was a despicable charade, and now that it is over, we will appeal this Hoax, which has no merit, and restore the trust of Americans in our once great System of Justice,” he continued. During the sentencing: Judge Juan Merchan said the legal protections of the presidency “do not reduce the seriousness of the crime or justify its commission in any way,” adding that “one power they do not provide is the power to erase a jury verdict.” The court is now releasing audio of today’s sentencing, which was not allowed to be broadcast live by media. The audio recording will provide an opportunity to hear Donald Trump speaking as he was sentenced for his hush money conviction, meaning he will enter the presidency as a felon, but receive no penalties. President-elect Donald Trump doesn’t have the same conditions as other convicted felons who have probationary periods, but instead has to maintain his role as president, CNN anchor Laura Coates said. “Donald Trump right now is in a league of his own for the reasons that my colleagues have described. But an unconditional release, normally, if somebody is convicted of a crime and does not have a jail sentence imposed, a probationary period comes in,” Coates said. Coates described responsibilities including checking in with a probation officer, engaging with drug testing and community service “in order to make sure that they don’t have the ability to be actually brought into a jail.” “Donald Trump doesn’t have any of those conditions. The condition he now has is to maintain his role as the commander in chief and president of the United States,” Coates said. Trump will take office on January 20. Judge Juan Merchan has sentenced Donald Trump to unconditional discharge. “The only lawful sentence that permits entry of a judgment or conviction without encroaching upon the highest office of the land is an unconditional discharge,” Merchan told Trump. The sentencing, which was expected, means Trump will remain a felon but faces no jail time, penalties or probation for his conviction in the hush money case. “Sir, I wish you godspeed as you assume your second term in office,” Merchan said in his final statement to Trump. Trump did not react as Merchan concluded the hearing. Judge Juan Merchan says he need not repeat the aggravating factors that he has already articulated in his recent orders. “However the considerable, indeed extraordinary, legal protections afforded the office of the chief executive is a factor that overrides all others,” he says. “They do not reduce the seriousness of the crime or justify its commission in any way,” Merchan says of the legal protections for the office of the presidency. “One power they do not provide is the power to erase a jury verdict,” Merchan says. Merchan noted that voters ultimately decided to bestow Trump the protections of the office once again. “Ordinary citizens do not receive those legal protections. It is the office of the president that bestows those to the office holder. It is the citizenry of this nation that recently decided that you should once again receive the benefits of those protections,” he says. Judge Juan Merchan is speaking to Donald Trump and is noting that it’s the office of the presidency that is extraordinary, not the occupant of the office. “It is the legal protections afforded to the office of the president of the United States that are extraordinary, not the occupant of the office,” he said. Merchan says that once the courtroom doors closed, the trial was not different from any other in the courthouse. Judge Juan Merchan says, “never before has this court been presented with such a unique and remarkable set of circumstance.” “This has been a truly extraordinary case,” he adds. As Judge Juan Merchan speaks, President-elect Donald Trump is leaning forward. Trump is alternating between looking ahead at Merchan and looking down and away from the screen. President-elect Donald Trump just finished speaking in court. “Thank you Mr. Trump,” Judge Juan Merchan says. “The imposition of sentence is one of the most difficult and significant decisions that any criminal court judge is called upon to make,” Merchan adds. Merchan says he believes that Trump needs to hear his reasoning for his sentence though he indicated his inclinations ahead of time. Donald Trump is insisting he is innocent at his sentencing hearing this morning. “The fact is I’m totally innocent. I did nothing wrong,” he says. Donald Trump mentioned his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, referring to past remarks. “He was allowed to talk like he was George Washington, but he’s not George Washington,” Trump said. President-elect Donald Trump is now discussing his 2024 election victory, saying in court that he won the popular vote by “millions and millions of votes” and noting that he won all seven swing states. “They’ve been watching your trial, so they understood it,” Trump said of the voters. President-elect Donald Trump said legal fees were not put down by him, but by his accountants. “Legal fees were put down as legal expenses by accountants; they weren’t put down by me. They didn’t call them construction, concrete work,” Trump said. “They called a legal expenses a legal expense and for this I got indicted. It’s incredible actually. “ “It’s been a political witch hunt, it was done to damage my reputation,” President-elect Donald Trump says. Donald Trump is going after the indictment and the charges of falsifying business records — after he chose not to testify at the trial. President-elect Donald Trump begins his statement at today’s sentencing hearing, saying “this has been a very terrible experience.” “I think it’s been a setback for New York and the New York court system. This is a case that Alvin Bragg did not want to bring.” Trump attorney Todd Blanche says it’s a “sad day” for the US. “It’s a very sad day. It’s a sad day for President Trump, for his family and friends, but also in counsel’s view, a sad day for this country,” he says. Todd Blanche, an attorney for President-elect Donald Trump, says the legal team intends to appeal the verdict. “A lot of what the government just said presupposes that this case is legally appropriate,” Blanche said following prosecutor Joshua Steinglass’s comments in court. Blache noted that Trump’s lawyers intend to appeal the verdict. “A majority of the American people also agree that this case should not have been brought,” Blanche added. Donald Trump’s attorney Todd Blanche is now arguing for the president-elect, saying he disagrees with prosecutors. “I very, very much disagree with much of what the government just said about this case, about the legitimacy of what happened in this courtroom during the trial, and about President Trump’s conduct fighting this case,” Blanche says. Trump is looking forward while Blanche speaks next to him, not reacting to what his attorney — and pick for deputy attorney general — is saying to the judge. The probation officer who interviewed President-elect Donald Trump for the probation report wrote that Trump believed he was “above the law,” prosecutor Joshua Steinglass says. Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass acknowledges that any other conditional discharge — meaning one with jail time, a fine or other penalty — has the potential to interfere with Trump’s obligations to the office of the presidency. “We must be respectful of the office of the presidency” and his pending inauguration, Steinglass says. Steinglass went on to say that a sentence of unconditional discharge preserves Trump’s status as a convicted felon while he pursues his appeals and, “It gives full effect and respect of the verdict while preserving the defendant’s ability to govern.” Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass points to Judge Juan Merchan’s previous comments that Trump’s conduct “constitutes a direct attack on the rule of law itself.” “This defendant has caused enduring damage to the public perception of the criminal justice system,” Steinglass says. Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass tells the court that Trump has been “far from expressing any kind of remorse for his criminal conduct” and “encouraged others to reject the jury verdict.” “He’s been unrelenting in his unsubstantiated attacks” on the court, prosecutors and the jury, Steinglass says of Trump. Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass is now listing off things he says President-elect Trump has done post-verdict to undermine the jury’s verdict. As Steinglass started criticizing Trump, the president-elect leaned back in his chair and folded his arms, shaking his head side to side. Donald Trump is shuffling in his chair while prosecutor John Steinglass speaks. He appears to be leaning forward to look at the screen. Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass recapped the case briefly and said, “The jury’s verdict in this case was unanimous and decisive and it must be respected.” He noted that the felonies Trump was convicted of could come with a prison sentence or other punishments without jail time. Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass says they are recommending a sentence of unconditional discharge. “Your honor indicated an inclination to impose an unconditional discharge under all the circumstances of this case, this unique posture and the defendant’s status as president elect, the people recommend a sentence of unconditional discharge,” he said. “Let’s impose sentence, please,” Judge Juan Merchan says. Judge Juan Merchan asks the prosecutors if there’s anything they’d like to put on the record about the probation report. Prosecutor Josh Steinglass asks for more time to read it, indicating they hadn’t seen it yet. Then Steinglass says they have nothing to add to the record. Trump attorney Todd Blanche spoke briefly to Trump while Steinglass was finishing reading the probation report. They are muted. On the video screen are four boxes. Judge Juan Merchan is on the upper left, President-elect Donald Trump and his attorney Todd Blanche are upper right, beneath them is his attorney Emil Bove and in the lower left is the prosecution table. Trump is staring straight ahead while Merchan talks to Blanche. President-elect Donald Trump’s attorney, Todd Blanche, says there are a few out of date facts in the probation report about other cases because of the date of the report. However, he says none of those details affect today’s hearing. A probation report has been handed to the attorneys. “Why don’t you take some time to look at it,” Judge Juan Merchan says. Trump attorney Todd Blanche — who is appearing with Donald Trump virtually from Florida — confirms he received a copy of the probation report this morning President-elect Donald Trump’s attorney Todd Blanche confirms they are appearing from Florida. Judge Juan Merchan notes that Trump was allowed to appear in person or virtually and chose to appear virtually. Judge Juan Merchan is on the bench. The court clerks have also entered the courtroom and are calling the case. President-elect Donald Trump and his attorney Todd Blanche are smiling as they wait for Trump’s sentencing in the hush money case to start. President-elect Donald Trump is now visible on the screen, seated in front of an American flag and beside Todd Blanche, his attorney. He is speaking a bit to Blanche, but there is no audio. He is wearing a dark suit, white shirt and red tie with stripes. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has entered the courtroom. He is seated in the galley behind the rest of the trial team. President-elect Donald Trump’s attorney Emil Bove has entered the New York courtroom for today’s sentencing hearing. He is alone at the defense table. Prosecutors have entered the courtroom ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s sentencing hearing. Prosecutors Joshua Steinglass, Christopher Conroy and Susan Hoffinger at the table. Matthew Colangelo and Rebecca Mangold are sitting behind them. Even though President-elect Donald Trump’s legal team fought to block Friday’s sentencing hearing from happening, they believe it is a significant victory that after being convicted of 34 felonies their client will only get an unconditional discharge, which is less than the penalty for a speeding ticket, a source familiar with their thinking tells CNN. Trump is of course unhappy about the New York hush money case and the sentencing that symbolizes his felony conviction, and that anger has driven their zealous appeals. But Trump’s lawyers see this as “checking a box” so they can appeal his conviction, the source said. His lawyers believe it’s a victory after he faced four criminal cases that he is facing no punishments and gets to be president again. Two federal cases related to January 6 and his handling of classified documents have been dismissed, and a Georgia district attorney has been disqualified in another case over efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss in that state. Trump’s lawyers expect Friday’s hearing to last about 45 minutes. In addition to comments from the judge and prosecutors, Trump lawyer Todd Blanche will speak during virtual appearance alongside his client. Trump lawyer Emil Bove also will be in courtroom. It’s not yet clear if Trump, who is appearing virtually, will speak at the sentencing, according to the source. President-elect Donald Trump will be sentenced this morning in his hush money case. The sentencing hearing is scheduled at 9:30 a.m. ET. Trump will appear virtually, according to a person familiar with the plans, and he’s expected to join the proceedings from Mar-a-Lago. Trump was convicted last year on 34 charges of business fraud related to hush money payment to Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential campaign. The Supreme Court didn’t help Donald Trump … this time. The court’s decision to deny the president-elect’s last-minute effort to delay sentencing in his New York hush money case sets up a stunning moment – a court date just 10 days before Trump is sworn in for a second term. Judge Juan Merchan has already said he won’t impose a jail term. But the sentencing hearing will nevertheless mean that Trump will be the first president to take office with a criminal conviction written into his official record. The proximity of the sentencing to Trump’s inauguration will create a stunning juxtaposition. He will be a defendant subject to the authority of a judge and a jury verdict who will within days assume the vast powers of the presidency and become the ultimate guardian of the nation’s laws and the Constitution. Thursday’s ruling – in which two conservatives sided with liberal justices – may in some small measure reassure those who believed that the court’s decisions had challenged the idea that every American, no matter their position in life, is equal before the law. But it will not quell the widespread anxiety among liberals that the conservative majority Trump built in his first term will show considerable deference to the commander in chief in a second administration that may test the rule of law and the Constitution more than his first. Read the full analysis. President-elect Donald Trump will appear virtually on Friday for sentencing in his hush money case, according to a person familiar with the plans. He will join the proceedings from Mar-a-Lago. The sentencing hearing is scheduled at 9:30 a.m. ET. On Thursday night, the Supreme Court allowed the sentencing to go on as scheduled. President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday attacked Judge Juan Merchan and said “this is a long way from finished” after the US Supreme Court ruled that Trump can be sentenced Friday in his hush money case. “We’re going to appeal anyway, just psychologically, because frankly it’s a disgrace. It’s a judge that shouldn’t have been on the case,” Trump said as he addressed reporters at Mar-a-Lago. Trump said, “They called for an appeal so I read it and I thought it was a fair decision, actually. So I’ll do my little thing tomorrow, they can have fun with their political opponent.” “This is a long way from finished. And I respect the court’s opinion. It was a, I think it was actually a very good opinion for us because you saw what they said. But they invited the appeal, and the appeal is on the bigger issue,” Trump said. “So we’ll see how it all works out. I think it’s going to work out well,” Trump said. President-elect Donald Trump can be sentenced Friday in his New York hush money case, the Supreme Court said in a 5-4 ruling. The high court on Thursday rejected Trump’s emergency request to delay the proceeding, setting the stage for him to be sentenced just days before he is inaugurated on January 20 for a second term. Four conservative justices – Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh — said they would have granted Trump’s request. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined the court’s three liberals to side against Trump. Judge Juan Merchan, the New York judge who oversaw Trump’s trial, had ordered sentencing in the case for Friday morning but has signaled that Trump will face neither penalties nor prison time. The sentencing hearing is scheduled for Friday at 9:30 a.m. ET. In a brief, one-paragraph statement, the court said that some of Trump’s concerns could be handled “in the ordinary course on appeal.” The court also reasoned that the burden sentencing would impose on Trump’s responsibilities is “relatively insubstantial” in light of the trial court’s stated intent to impose no penalty. Read more about the ruling here. President-elect Donald Trump is set to be sentenced today on charges of business fraud related to hush money payment to Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential election. Here’s what you need to know about the case: Trump was first indicted in March 2023 by the Manhattan district attorney on state charges related to a hush-money payment to an adult-film star in 2016. On May 30, 2024 he was found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree by 12 jurors. Prosecutors alleged during the trial that Trump was a part of an illegal conspiracy to undermine the integrity of the 2016 election. Further they alleged he was part of an unlawful plan to suppress negative information and over payment to his then-lawyer Michael Cohen to reimburse a $130,000 hush money payment made to adult-film star Stormy Daniels to keep her from speaking out about an alleged affair before the 2016 election — Trump has denied the affair. On November 19, 2024, the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office told Judge Juan Merchan it would agree to delay Trump’s sentencing, which had been set for November 26, to allow time for the anticipated litigation around the president-elect’s expected motion to dismiss the case. On November 22, 2024, Merchan indefinitely postponed the sentencing and granted Trump’s request to file a motion to dismiss the case. On January 3, 2025, Merchan rejected Trump’s effort to throw out the jury’s verdict because of his reelection in November and upheld the conviction.

                "content": "Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time The New York judge who presided over Donald Trump’s hush money case on Friday sentenced the president-elect to an “unconditional discharge,” meaning he is now a convicted felon in the eyes of New York state law but will face no further penalties. \"This has been a very terrible experience,\" a dour Trump said, speaking remotely from his Florida home when allowed to address the judge. “It was done to damage my reputation so I would lose the election,” he said. \"I am totally innocent. I did nothing wrong,\" he maintained. The sentencing came just 10 days before Trump is set to be sworn in as the country’s 47th president. \"Never before has this court been presented with such a unique and remarkable set of circumstances,\" Judge Juan Merchan said before he handed down his sentence. “This has been a truly extraordinary case.” He cited the immunity and legal protections Trump will soon have as the reasons for sentencing him with an unconditional discharge, which he called \"the only lawful sentence that permits entry of a judgment of conviction without encroaching upon the highest office in the land.\" \"Donald Trump, the ordinary citizen, Donald Trump, the criminal defendant, would not be entitled to such considerable protections,\" Merchan said. Trump’s attorneys had repeatedly sought to stay the proceeding, which Merchan scheduled last week. Their appeals to Merchan, two state appeals courts and even the country’s highest court over the past week were unsuccessful. Trump’s last hope, the U.S. Supreme Court, declined to block the proceeding in a 5-4 ruling late Thursday. Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said in court that Trump was convicted of 34 felony counts punishable by one to four years in prison, but recommended the judge hand down “a sentence of unconditional release” given the unique circumstances of the case. “We must be respectful of the office of the presidency, and mindful of the fact that this defendant will be inaugurated as president in ten days,” Steinglass said, while also saying that Trump has acted like he’s “above the law” throughout the case, including with his frequent verbal attacks on the judge, prosecutors and even their family members. \"This defendant has caused enduring damage to the public perception of the criminal justice system,\" he said. Trump attorney Todd Blanche countered that it was the Manhattan district attorney's office that overstepped in the case. He said Steinglass' position assumes “this case is legally appropriate, and the charges that were brought by the people were consistent with the laws of New York. Again we very much disagree with that.” “This is a case that without a doubt was brought by a district attorney who promised he would go after President Trump if elected, and he had to go through with that promise,” Blanche said. \"It’s a very sad day. It’s a sad day for President Trump and his family and his friends, but it’s also, in counsel’s view, a sad day for this country,” Blanche said, adding that Trump planned to fully appeal the case after the sentence was entered. Follow along for live coverage The sentencing means Trump will make some ignominious history before he becomes only the second president to be sworn in for two nonconsecutive terms: He'll be the only president to have been sentenced on criminal charges. Trump, in remarks to the media from his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida on Thursday after the Supreme Court ruling, alluded to the possibility of further appeals, such as an attempt to appeal the verdict itself. “So I’ll do my little thing tomorrow. They can have fun with their political opponent,” he said. The president-elect took to his social media platform Truth Social after the proceeding Friday to tout the light sentence. “That result alone proves that, as all Legal Scholars and Experts have said, THERE IS NO CASE, THERE WAS NEVER A CASE, and this whole Scam fully deserves to be DISMISSED.” Merchan had revealed in a decision last week ordering the sentencing to proceed that he would most likely give Trump an unconditional discharge given singular circumstances. He also, however, blasted Trump for both the conduct that led to his conviction in May and his behavior during and after the trial. Responding last week in his ruling to Trump's argument that the charges weren’t serious and that they should be dismissed, Merchan wrote, \"12 jurors unanimously found Defendant guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records with the intent to defraud, which included an intent to commit or conceal a conspiracy to promote a presidential election by unlawful means. It was the premeditated and continuous deception by the leader of the free world that is the gravamen of this offense.\" \"To vacate this verdict on the grounds that the charges are insufficiently serious given the position Defendant once held, and is about to assume again, would constitute a disproportionate result and cause immeasurable damage to the citizenry's confidence in the Rule of Law,\" he wrote. He also took Trump to task for his attacks on the judicial system. \"Defendant's disdain for the Third Branch of government, whether state or federal, in New York or elsewhere, is a matter of public record. Indeed, Defendant has gone to great lengths to broadcast on social media and other forums his lack of respect for judges, juries, grand juries and the justice system as a whole,\" Merchan wrote, saying he'd repeatedly found Trump in contempt for violating his partial gag order in the case \"despite repeated admonitions.\" Trump, he noted, has continued to call the order \"unlawful\" and \"unconstitutional,\" even though \"it has been challenged and upheld by the Appellate Division First Department and the New York Court of Appeals, no less than eight times.\" \"Indeed, as Defendant must surely know, the same Order was left undisturbed by the United States Supreme Court on December 9, 2024. Yet Defendant continues to undermine its legitimacy, in posts to his millions of followers,\" Merchan wrote. The gag order expired after the sentencing, per the terms of a Merchan order last June. In his ruling last week, the judge noted that a sentence of incarceration is \"authorized by the conviction\" but said it is also an alternative that even prosecutors \"no longer view as a practicable recommendation\" given Trump's imminent swearing-in. Blanche suggested at an appeals court hearing seeking to block the sentencing this week that he was skeptical Merchan would give Trump an unconditional discharge, despite what he wrote in his order. “I don’t know how anyone can give any weight to that,” Blanche said. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg told reporters Thursday, \"We believe that the sanctity of the jury verdict must be given primacy, must be upheld as part of the rule of law, but we’re also mindful of and respect the institution of the presidency.\" Trump's conviction arose from charges that he falsified business records related to hush money his former attorney Michael Cohen gave porn star Stormy Daniels in the closing days of the 2016 presidential campaign. Daniels testified that she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006, which he has denied. The case was one of four criminal cases Trump was facing at the beginning of 2024 and the only one that went to trial. A state case charging Trump interfered in the 2020 election in Georgia is paused as Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is challenging an appeals court order that removed her and her office from the case last month. The Justice Department dropped two federal cases brought by special counsel Jack Smith after Trump won the election, citing its Office of Legal Counsel's holding that it can’t prosecute a sitting president.
