                "content": "The Premier League is a professional association football league in England and the highest level of the English football league system. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League (EFL). Seasons usually run from August to May, with each team playing 38 matches: two against each other team, one home and one away.[1] Most games are played on weekend afternoons, with occasional weekday evening fixtures.[2] The competition was founded as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992, following the decision of First Division (the top-tier league from 1888 until 1992) clubs to break away from the English Football League. However, teams may still be relegated to and promoted from the EFL Championship. The Premier League is a corporation managed by a chief executive, with member clubs acting as shareholders.[3] The Premier League takes advantage of a £5 billion television rights deal, with Sky and BT Group securing the domestic rights to broadcast 128 and 32 games, respectively.[4][5] This deal will rise to £6.7 billion for the four seasons from 2025 to 2029.[6] The league is projected to earn $7.2 billion in overseas TV rights from 2022 to 2025.[7] Clubs were apportioned central payment revenues of £2.4 billion in 2016–17, with a further £343 million in solidarity payments to EFL clubs.[8] The Premier League is the most-watched sports league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes, with a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people.[9][10] For the 2023–24 season, the average Premier League match attendance was 38,375,[11] second to the German Bundesliga's 39,512,[12] whilst aggregated attendance across all matches in a 38-game season is the highest of any association football league.[13] Most stadium occupancies are near capacity.[14] As of 2023[update], the Premier League is ranked first in the UEFA coefficient rankings based on performances in European competitions over the past five seasons, ahead of Spain's La Liga.[15] The English top-flight has produced the second-highest number of European Cup / UEFA Champions League titles, with a record six English clubs having won fifteen European championships in total.[16] Fifty-one clubs have competed in the Premier League since its inception in 1992: 49 from England and 2 from Wales. Seven of them have won the title: Manchester United (13), Manchester City (8), Chelsea (5), Arsenal (3), Blackburn Rovers (1), Leicester City (1), and Liverpool (1).[17] Only six clubs have played in every season to date: Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United, and Tottenham Hotspur.[18] Despite significant European success in the 1970s and early 1980s, the late 1980s marked a low point for English football. Stadiums were deteriorating, supporters endured poor facilities, hooliganism was rife, and English clubs had been banned from European competition for five years following the Heysel Stadium disaster between the fans of Liverpool Football Club and the fans of Juventus in 1985.[19] The Football League First Division, the top level of English football since 1888, was behind leagues such as Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga in attendance and revenues, and several top English players had moved abroad.[20] By the turn of the 1990s, the downward trend was starting to reverse. At the 1990 FIFA World Cup, England reached the semi-finals; UEFA, European football's governing body, lifted the five-year ban on English clubs playing in European competitions in 1990, resulting in Manchester United lifting the Cup Winners' Cup in 1991. The Taylor Report on stadium safety standards, which proposed expensive upgrades to create all-seater stadiums in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster; between the fans of Liverpool and the fans of Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield, Yorkshire on 15 April 1989, was published in January 1990.[21] During the 1980s, major English clubs began to transform into business ventures, applying commercial principles to club administration to maximise revenue. Martin Edwards of Manchester United, Irving Scholar of Tottenham Hotspur, and David Dein of Arsenal were among the leaders in this transformation.[22] The commercial imperative led to the top clubs seeking to increase their power and revenue: the clubs in Division One threatened to break away from the Football League, and in doing so, they managed to increase their voting power and gain a more favourable financial arrangement, taking a 50% share of all television and sponsorship income in 1986.[22] They demanded that television companies should pay more for their coverage of football matches,[23] and revenue from television grew in importance. The Football League received £6.3 million for a two-year agreement in 1986, but by 1988, in a deal agreed with ITV, the price rose to £44 million over four years, with the leading clubs taking 75% of the cash.[24][25] According to Scholar, who was involved in the negotiations of television deals, each of the First Division clubs received only around £25,000 per year from television rights before 1986, this increased to around £50,000 in the 1986 negotiation, then to £600,000 in 1988.[26] The 1988 negotiations were conducted under the threat of ten clubs leaving to form a \"super league\", but they were eventually persuaded to stay, with the top clubs taking the lion's share of the deal.[24][27][28] The negotiations also convinced the bigger clubs that, in order to receive enough votes, they needed to take the whole of the First Division with them instead of a smaller \"super league\".[29] By the beginning of the 1990s, the big clubs again considered breaking away, especially now that they had to fund the cost of stadium upgrades as proposed by the Taylor Report.[30] In 1990, the managing director of London Weekend Television (LWT), Greg Dyke, met with the representatives of the \"big five\" football clubs in England (Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur, Everton, and Arsenal) over a dinner.[31] The meeting was to pave the way for a breakaway from the Football League.[32] Dyke believed that it would be more lucrative for LWT if only the larger clubs in the country were featured on national television and wanted to establish whether the clubs would be interested in a larger share of television rights money.[33] The five clubs agreed with the suggestion and decided to press ahead with it; however, the league would have no credibility without the backing of the Football Association, and so David Dein of Arsenal held talks to see whether the FA were receptive to the idea. The FA did not have an amicable relationship with the Football League at the time and considered it a way to weaken the Football League's position.[34] The FA released a report in June 1991, Blueprint for the Future of Football, that supported the plan for the Premier League, with the FA as the ultimate authority that would oversee the breakaway league.[29] At the close of the 1990–1991 season, a proposal was tabled for the establishment of a new league that would bring more money into the game overall. The Founder Members Agreement, signed on 17 July 1991, by the game's top-flight clubs, established the basic principles for setting up the FA Premier League.[35] The newly formed top division was to have commercial independence from the Football Association and the Football League, giving the FA Premier League licence to negotiate its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements. The argument given at the time was that the extra income would allow English clubs to compete with teams across Europe.[20] Although Dyke played a significant role in the creation of the Premier League, he and ITV (of which LWT was part) lost out in the bidding for broadcast rights: BSkyB won with a bid of £304 million over five years, with the BBC awarded the highlights package broadcast on Match of the Day.[31][33] Luton Town, Notts County, and West Ham United were the three teams relegated from the old First Division at the end of the 1991–92 season, and did not take part in the inaugural Premier League season. They were replaced by Ipswich Town, Middlesbrough, and Blackburn Rovers, promoted from the old Second Division.[36] The 22 First Division clubs resigned en masse from the Football League in 1992, and on 27 May that year, the FA Premier League was formed as a limited company, working out of an office at the Football Association's then headquarters in Lancaster Gate.[20] The 22 inaugural members of the new Premier League were:[37] This meant a break-up of the 104-year-old Football League that had operated until then with four divisions; the Premier League would operate with a single division and the Football League with three. There was no change in competition format; the same number of teams competed in the top flight, and promotion and relegation between the Premier League and the new First Division remained the same as the old First and Second Divisions, with three teams relegated from the league and three promoted.[28] The league held its first season in 1992–93. It was composed of 22 clubs for that season (reduced to 20 in the 1995–96 season). The first Premier League goal was scored by Brian Deane of Sheffield United in a 2–1 win against Manchester United.[38] Manchester United won the inaugural edition of the new league, ending a twenty-six year wait to be crowned champions of England. Bolstered by this breakthrough, United immediately became the competition's dominant team, winning seven of the first nine trophies, two League and FA Cup 'doubles' and a European treble, initially under a team of hardened veterans such as Bryan Robson, Steve Bruce, Paul Ince, Mark Hughes, and Eric Cantona, before Cantona, Bruce, and Roy Keane led a young, dynamic new team filled with the Class of 92, a group of young players including David Beckham who came through the Manchester United Academy. Between 1993 and 1997, Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United came close to challenging Manchester United's early dominance; Blackburn won the 1994–95 FA Premier League and Newcastle led the title charge over United for much of the 1995–96 season. As the decade closed, Arsenal replicated Manchester United's dominance by winning the League and FA Cup double in 1997–98, and together they would form a duopoly over the league between 1997 and 2003. The 2000s saw the rise of Liverpool alongside the \"Big 2\", followed by Chelsea finally breaking the Arsenal–Man United duopoly by winning the league in 2004–05. The dominance of the so-called \"Big Four\" clubs – Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, and Manchester United[39][40] – saw them finish at the top of the table for most of the decade, thereby guaranteeing qualification for the UEFA Champions League. Only three other clubs managed to qualify for the competition during this period: Newcastle United (2001–02 and 2002–03), Everton (2004–05), and Tottenham Hotspur (2009–10) – each occupying the final Champions League spot, with the exception of Newcastle in the 2002–03 season, who finished third. Following the 2003–04 season, Arsenal acquired the nickname \"The Invincibles\" as they became the first and, to date, only club to complete a Premier League campaign without losing a single game.[41][42] In May 2008, Kevin Keegan stated that \"Big Four\" dominance threatened the division: \"This league is in danger of becoming one of the most boring but great leagues in the world.\"[43] Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said in defence: \"There are a lot of different tussles that go on in the Premier League depending on whether you're at the top, in the middle, or at the bottom that make it interesting.\"[44] Between 2005 and 2012, there was a Premier League representative in seven of the eight Champions League finals, with only the \"Big Four\" clubs reaching that stage. Liverpool (2005), Manchester United (2008), and Chelsea (2012) won the competition during this period, with Arsenal (2006), Liverpool (2007), Chelsea (2008), and Manchester United (2009 and 2011) all losing Champions League finals.[45] Leeds United were the only non-\"Big Four\" side to reach the semi-finals of the Champions League, in the 2000–01 season. There were three Premier League teams in the Champions League semi-finals in 2006–07, 2007–08, and 2008–09, a feat only ever achieved five times (along with Serie A in 2002–03 and La Liga in 1999–2000). Additionally, between the 1999–2000 and 2009–10 seasons, four Premier League sides reached the UEFA Cup or Europa League finals, with only Liverpool managing to win the competition in 2001. Arsenal (2000), Middlesbrough (2006), and Fulham (2010) all lost their finals.[46] Although the group's dominance was reduced to a degree after this period with the emergence of Manchester City and Tottenham, in terms of all-time Premier League points won, they remain clear by some margin. As of the end of the 2021–22 season – the 30th season of the Premier League – Liverpool, in fourth place in the all-time points table, were over 300 points ahead of the next team, Tottenham Hotspur. They are also the only teams to maintain a winning average of over 50% throughout their entire Premier League tenures.[47] The years following 2009 marked a shift from the \"Big Four\" with Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City breaking into the top four places on a regular basis, turning the \"Big Four\" into the \"Big Six\".[48] In the 2009–10 season, Tottenham finished fourth and became the first new team to finish in the top four since Everton five years prior.[49] Criticism of the gap between an elite group of \"super clubs\" and the majority of the Premier League has continued, nevertheless, due to their increasing ability to spend more than the other Premier League clubs.[50] Manchester City won the title in the 2011–12 season, becoming the first club outside the \"Big Four\" to win since Blackburn Rovers in the 1994–95 season. That season also saw two of the \"Big Four\" (Chelsea and Liverpool) finish outside the top four places for the first time since that season.[48] With only four UEFA Champions League qualifying places available in the league, greater competition for qualification now exists, albeit from a narrow base of six clubs. In the five seasons following the 2011–12 campaign, Manchester United and Liverpool both found themselves outside of the top four three times, whilst Chelsea finished 10th in the 2015–16 season. Arsenal finished 5th in 2016–17, ending their record run of 20 consecutive top-four finishes.[51] In the 2015–16 season, underdogs Leicester City won the Premier League. With 5000/1 odds of winning the league at the beginning of the season, Leicester became the first club outside the \"Big Six\" to win the Premier League since Blackburn Rovers in the 1994–95 season.[52] Off the pitch, the \"Big Six\" wield significant financial power and influence, with these clubs arguing that they should be entitled to a greater share of revenue due to the greater stature of their clubs globally and the attractive football they aim to play.[53] Objectors argue that the egalitarian revenue structure in the Premier League helps to maintain a competitive league which is vital for its future success.[54] The 2016–17 Deloitte Football Money League report showed the financial disparity between the \"Big Six\" and the rest of the division. All of the \"Big Six\" had revenues greater than €350 million, with Manchester United having the largest revenue in the league at €676.3 million. Leicester City was the closest club to the \"Big Six\" in terms of revenue, recording a figure of €271.1 million for that season – helped by participation in the Champions League. The eighth-largest revenue generator, West Ham – who did not play in European competition – had revenues of €213.3 million, less than half of those of the club with the fifth-largest revenue, Liverpool (€424.2 million).[55] A substantial part of the clubs' revenue by then came from television broadcast deals, with the biggest clubs each taking from around £150 million to nearly £200 million in the 2016–17 season from such deals.[56] In Deloitte's 2019 report, all the \"Big Six\" were in the top ten of the world's richest clubs.[57] From the 2019–20 season, video assistant referees were used in the league.[58] The 2019–20 season saw Liverpool win their first Premier League trophy, their first top-flight trophy in 30 years.[59] Project Big Picture was announced in October 2020 that described a plan to reunite the top Premier League clubs with the English Football League, proposed by leading Premier League clubs Manchester United and Liverpool.[60] It has been criticised by the Premier League leadership and the UK government's Department for Culture, Media and Sport.[61] On 26 April 2021, play was stopped during a match between Leicester City and Crystal Palace to allow players Wesley Fofana and Cheikhou Kouyaté to break Ramadan fast. It is believed to be the first time in Premier League history that a game was paused to allow Muslim players to eat and drink after the sun had set in accordance with the rules of the faith.[62] The 2022–23 season was the first to take a six-week break between November and December 2022 to allow for the first winter World Cup,[63] with a return for the Boxing Day fixtures.[64] The Premier League players decided to take the knee at selected \"significant moments\". They assured to \"remain resolutely committed to eradicate racial prejudice\".[65] That season was notable for Newcastle United and Brighton & Hove Albion breaking the traditional \"Big Six\" as they finished fourth and sixth, respectively, whilst \"Big Six\" teams Tottenham and Chelsea finished eighth and twelfth.[66][67] Meanwhile, 2015–16 champions Leicester City were relegated, becoming the second league-winning club to suffer relegation since 1992, after Blackburn Rovers in the 2011–12 season.[68] In the 2023–24 season, Manchester City won the Premier League for the sixth time in seven years to become the first top-flight team to win four consecutive league titles in English football history.[69] Meanwhile, non-Big Six club Aston Villa finished fourth and qualified for the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League.[70] The Football Association Premier League Ltd (FAPL)[71][72][73] is operated as a corporation and is owned by the 20 member clubs. Each club is a shareholder, with one vote each on issues such as rule changes and contracts. The clubs select a chairman, chief executive, and board of directors to oversee the daily operations of the league.[74] The Football Association is not directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the Premier League, but has veto power as a special shareholder during the election of the chairman and chief executive and when new rules are adopted by the league.[75] The current chief executive is Richard Masters, who was appointed in December 2019.[76] The chair is currently Alison Brittain, who took over the role in early 2023.[77] The Premier League sends representatives to UEFA's European Club Association, the number of clubs and the clubs themselves chosen according to UEFA coefficients. For the 2023–24 season, the Premier League has 13 representatives in the Association: Arsenal, Aston Villa, Brighton & Hove Albion, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Newcastle United, Nottingham Forest, Tottenham Hotspur, West Ham United, and Wolverhampton Wanderers.[78] The European Club Association is responsible for electing three members to UEFA's Club Competitions Committee, which is involved in the operations of UEFA competitions such as the Champions League and UEFA Europa League.[79] The Premier League has faced criticism of its governance due to an alleged lack of transparency and accountability. Following the Premier League's blocking of the attempted takeover of Newcastle United by a PIF-backed consortium through the league's Owners' and Directors' test, many MPs, Newcastle United fans and related parties to the deal denounced the Premier League for its perceived lack of transparency and accountability throughout the process.[80][81][82] On 6 July 2021, consortium member Amanda Staveley of PCP Capital Partners said that \"fans surely deserve absolute transparency from the regulators across all their processes – to best ensure that they act responsibly. They (the Premier League) are performing a function like that of a government regulator – but without the same systems for accountability.\"[82] On 22 July 2021, Tracey Crouch MP – chair of the fan-led review into the UK's football governance – announced in the review's interim findings that the Premier League had \"lost the trust and confidence\" of fans. The review also recommended that a new independent regulator be created to oversee matters such as club takeovers.[83][84] Premier League chief executive Richard Masters had earlier spoken out against the implementation of an independent regulator, saying in May 2021, \"I don't think that the independent regulator is the answer to the question. I would defend the Premier League's role as regulator of its clubs over the past 30 years.\"[85] [The Premier League] is very tough and is different. If you compare this league to another league, it's like playing another sport. In [The Premier League] you never really know what is going to happen, there is very little between the teams. There are 20 clubs in the Premier League. During the course of a season (from August to May) each club plays the others twice (a double round-robin system), once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents, for 38 games. Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw. No points are awarded for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, then goal difference, and then goals scored. If still equal, teams are deemed to occupy the same position. If there is a tie for the championship, for relegation, or for qualification to other competitions, the head-to-head record between the tied teams is taken into consideration (points scored in the matches between the teams, followed by away goals in those matches.) If two teams are still tied, a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank.[88] A system of promotion and relegation exists between the Premier League and the EFL Championship. The three lowest placed teams in the Premier League are relegated to the Championship, and the top two teams from the Championship promoted to the Premier League,[89] with an additional team promoted after a series of play-offs involving the third, fourth, fifth and sixth placed clubs.[90] The number of clubs was reduced from 22 to 20 in 1995, when four teams were relegated from the league and only two teams promoted.[91][92] The top flight had only been expanded to 22 teams at the start of the 1991–92 season – the year prior to the formation of the Premier League.[92] On 8 June 2006, FIFA requested that all major European leagues, including Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga, be reduced to 18 teams by the start of the 2007–08 season. The Premier League responded by announcing their intention to resist such a reduction.[93] Ultimately, the 2007–08 season kicked off again with 20 teams.[94] Video assistant referee (VAR), was introduced to the Premier League at the beginning of the 2019–20 season. It uses technology and officials to assist the referee in making decisions on the pitch.[95] However, its use has been met with mixed receptions from fans and pundits, with some praising its accuracy whilst others criticise its impact on the flow of the game and consistency of decision-making. The on-field referee still makes the final decision, but VAR can assist the referee in the decision-making process. VAR can only be used for four types of decisions: goals, penalty decisions, direct red card incidents, and cases of mistaken identity. VAR officials review the video footage and communicate with the on-field referee via a headset. The VAR officials are located in a central control room, which is equipped with multiple camera angles and the ability to replay footage at various speeds. A study evaluating fan reception of VAR in the Premier League was made by Otto Kolbinger and Melanie Knopp and was done by analysing Twitter data.[96] The researchers used sentiment analysis to measure the overall positive or negative attitudes towards VAR, as well as topic modelling to identify specific issues that fans are discussing related to VAR. The study found that the reception of VAR on Twitter is largely negative, with fans expressing frustration and criticism of the technology's impact on the flow of the game and the inconsistency of decisions. The researchers also identified specific issues, such as handball and offside decisions, that fans are particularly critical of. The study concludes that VAR has not been well received by fans in the Premier League, and that efforts to improve the technology and increase transparency in decision-making are needed to address these concerns. Fifty-one clubs have played in the Premier League from its inception in 1992, up to and including the 2023–24 season.[97] Titles won by club (%) Italics indicate former Premier League champions that are currently outside the Premier League. Twenty clubs are competing in the 2024–25 season – top seventeen from the previous season and three promoted from the Championship. In 2011, after Swansea City gained promotion, a Welsh club participated in the Premier League for the first time.[98][99] The first Premier League match to be played outside England was Swansea City's home match at Liberty Stadium against Wigan Athletic on 20 August 2011.[100] The number of Welsh clubs in the Premier League increased to two in 2013–14, as Cardiff City gained promotion,[101] but they were relegated after their maiden season.[102] Cardiff were promoted again in 2017–18 but the number of Welsh clubs remained the same for the 2018–19 Premier League season, as Swansea City had been relegated from the Premier League in 2017–18.[103] Following Cardiff City's relegation after the 2018–19 season, there are currently no Welsh clubs participating in the Premier League.[104] Because they are members of the Football Association of Wales (FAW), the question of whether clubs like Swansea should represent England or Wales in European competitions has caused long-running discussions in UEFA. Swansea took one of England's three available places in the Europa League in 2013–14 by winning the League Cup in 2012–13.[105] The right of Welsh clubs to take up such English places was in doubt until UEFA clarified the matter in March 2012, allowing them to participate.[106] Participation in the Premier League by some Scottish or Irish clubs has sometimes been discussed, but without result. The idea came closest to reality in 1998, when Wimbledon received Premier League approval to relocate to Dublin, Ireland, but the move was blocked by the Football Association of Ireland.[107][108][109][110] Additionally, the media occasionally discusses the idea that Scotland's two biggest teams, Celtic and Rangers, should or will take part in the Premier League, but nothing has come of these discussions.[111] The top four teams in the Premier League qualify automatically for the subsequent season's UEFA Champions League league phase. The champions of the Champions League and UEFA Europa League may earn an additional qualification for the subsequent season's Champions League league phase if did not finish in the top four. If this means six Premier League teams qualify, then the fourth-placed team in the Premier League is instead entered in the Europa League, as any single nation is limited to a maximum of five teams in the Champions League. However, starting from the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League there are additional berths for the two best associations in the previous season's ranking, which may result in a maximum of six teams from one association in the Champions League. The fifth-placed team in the Premier League, as well as the winners of the FA Cup, qualify for the subsequent season's Europa League league phase, but if the winner of the FA Cup also finishes in the top five places in the Premier League or has won one of UEFA's major tournaments, then this place reverts to the team that finished sixth. The winner of the EFL Cup qualifies for the subsequent season's UEFA Conference League, but if the winner had already qualified for a UEFA competition via their performance in another competition, then this place reverts to the team that finished sixth in the Premier League, or seventh if the FA Cup result had already caused the sixth-placed team to qualify.[112] The number of places allocated to English clubs in UEFA competitions is dependent upon the position the country holds in the UEFA coefficient rankings, which are calculated based on the performance of teams in UEFA competitions over the previous five years. Currently, England is ranked first, ahead of Spain. As of 26 September 2024, the coefficients for are as follows (only top five European leagues are shown):[113][114] An exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions League the season before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers.[115] The governing body subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that if the Champions League winners finished outside the top four in its domestic league, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team. At that time, no association could have more than four entrants in the Champions League.[116] This occurred in 2012, when Chelsea – who had won the Champions League that summer, but finished sixth in the league – qualified for the 2012–13 Champions League in place of Tottenham Hotspur, who went into the Europa League.[117] From 2015–16, the Europa League champions qualify for the Champions League, increasing the maximum number of participants per country to five.[118] This took effect in England in 2016–17, when Manchester United finished sixth in the Premier League and won the Europa League, giving England five Champions League entrants for 2017–18.[119] In these instances, any Europa League berth vacated is not handed down to the next-best Premier League finisher outside of a qualifying place. If both Champions League and Europa League winners are of the same association and both finish outside the top four, then the fourth-placed team is transferred to the Europa League. With 48 continental trophies won, English clubs are the third-most successful in European football, behind Italy (50) and Spain (67). In the top-tier UEFA Champions League, a record six English clubs have won a total of 15 titles and lost a further 11 finals, behind Spanish clubs with 20 and 11, respectively.[120] In the second-tier UEFA Europa League, English clubs are third, with nine victories and eight losses in the finals.[121] In the former second-tier UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, English teams won a record eight titles and had a further five finalists.[122] In the non-UEFA organised Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, English clubs provided four winners and four runners-up, the second-most behind Spain with six and three, respectively.[123] In the newly created third-tier UEFA Conference League, English clubs have won a joint-record one title so far.[124] In the former fourth-tier UEFA Intertoto Cup, England won four titles and had a further final appearance, placing it fifth in the rankings, although English clubs were notorious for treating the tournament with disdain, either sending \"B\" squads or withdrawing from it altogether.[125][126][127] In the one-off UEFA Super Cup, England has ten winners and ten runners-up, the second-most behind Spain with 17 and 15, respectively.[128] Similarly to the Intertoto Cup, English teams did not take the former Intercontinental Cup seriously enough, despite its international status of the Club World Championship. They a made a total of six appearances in the one-off competition, winning only one of them, and withdrew a further three times.[129] English clubs have won the FIFA-organised Club World Cup four times, tied for the second-most with Brazil, and behind only Spain, with eight.[130][127] After an inaugural season with no sponsorship, the Premier League was sponsored by Carling from 1993 until 2001, during which time it was known as the FA Carling Premiership. In 2001, a new sponsorship deal with Barclaycard saw the league rebranded the FA Barclaycard Premiership, which was changed to the FA Barclays Premiership in time for the 2004–05 season. For the 2007–08 season, the league was rebranded the Barclays Premier League.[131][132] Barclays' deal with the Premier League expired at the end of the 2015–16 season. The organisation announced on 4 June 2015 that it would not pursue any further title sponsorship deals for the Premier League, arguing that they wanted to build a \"clean\" brand for the competition more in line with those of major U.S. sports leagues.[134] As well as sponsorship for the league itself, the Premier League has a number of official partners and suppliers.[135] The official ball supplier for the league is Nike who have had the contract since the 2000–01 season when they took over from Mitre.[136] Under its Merlin brand, Topps held the licence to produce collectables for the Premier League between 1994 and 2019 including stickers (for their sticker album) and trading cards.[137] Launched in the 2007–08 season, Topps' Match Attax, the official Premier League trading card game, is the best selling boys collectable in the UK, and is also the biggest selling sports trading card game in the world.[137][138] In October 2018, Panini were awarded the licence to produce collectables from the 2019–20 season.[139] The chocolate company Cadbury has been the official snack partner of the Premier League since 2017, and sponsored the Golden Boot, Golden Glove and Playmaker of the Season awards from the 2017–18 season to 2019–20 season.[140][141] The Coca-Cola Company (under its Coca-Cola Zero Sugar product line) sponsored these awards during the 2020–21 season with Castrol being the current sponsor as of the 2021–22 season.[142] The Premier League has the highest revenue of any association football league in the world, with total club revenues of €2.48 billion in 2009–10.[143][144] In 2013–14, due to improved television revenues and cost controls, the Premier League clubs collectively made a net profit in excess of £78 million, exceeding all other football leagues.[145] In 2010 the Premier League was awarded the Queen's Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category for its outstanding contribution to international trade and the value it brings to English football and the United Kingdom's broadcasting industry.[146] The Premier League includes some of the richest football clubs in the world. Deloitte's \"Football Money League\" listed seven Premier League clubs in the top 20 for the 2009–10 season,[147] and all 20 clubs were in the top 40 globally by the end of the 2013–14 season, largely as a result of increased broadcasting revenue.[148] In 2019, the league generated around £3.1 billion per year in domestic and international television rights.[4] Premier League clubs agreed in principle in December 2012, to radical new cost controls. The two proposals consist of a break-even rule and a cap on the amount clubs can increase their wage bill by each season. With the new television deals on the horizon, momentum has been growing to find ways of preventing the majority of the cash going straight to players and agents.[149] Central payments for the 2016–17 season amounted to £2,398,515,773 across the 20 clubs, with each team receiving a flat participation fee of £35,301,989 and additional payments for TV broadcasts (£1,016,690 for general UK rights to match highlights, £1,136,083 for each live UK broadcast of their games and £39,090,596 for all overseas rights), commercial rights (a flat fee of £4,759,404) and a notional measure of \"merit\" which was based upon final league position.[8] The merit component was a nominal sum of £1,941,609 multiplied by each finishing place, counted from the foot of the table (e.g., Burnley finished 16th in May 2017, five places counting upwards, and received 5 × £1,941,609 = £9,708,045 merit payment).[8] Since its split with the Football League, established clubs in the Premier League have a funding disparity from counterparts in lower leagues. Revenue from television rights between the leagues has played a part in this.[150] Promoted teams have found it difficult to avoid relegation in their first Premier League season. One Premier League newcomer has been relegated back to the Football League every season, save the 2001–02, 2011–12, 2017–18 & 2022–23 seasons. In the 1997–98 and 2023–24 seasons, all three promoted clubs were relegated by the season's end.[151] The Premier League distributes a portion of its television revenue as \"parachute payments\" to relegated clubs for adjustment to television revenue loss. The average Premier League team receives £41 million[152] whilst the average Championship club receives £2 million.[153] Starting with the 2013–14 season, these payments are in excess of £60 million over four seasons.[154] Critics maintain that the payments widen the gap between teams that have reached the Premier League and those that have not,[155] leading to the common occurrence of teams \"bouncing back\" soon after their relegation. Clubs which have failed to win immediate promotion back to the Premier League have seen financial problems, in some cases administration or liquidation. Further relegations down the footballing ladder have occurred for multiple clubs unable to cope with the gap.[156][157] Television has played a major role in the history of the Premier League. The League's decision to assign broadcasting rights to Sky in 1992 was at the time a radical decision, but one that has paid off. At the time, paid television was an almost untested proposition in the UK market as was charging fans to watch live televised football. However, a combination of Sky's strategy, the quality of Premier League football and the public's appetite for the game has seen the value of the Premier League's TV rights soar.[25] The Premier League sells its television rights on a collective basis. This is in contrast to some other European leagues, including La Liga, in which each club sells its rights individually, leading to a much higher share of the total income going to the top few clubs.[159] The money is divided into three parts:[160] half is divided equally between the clubs; one quarter is awarded on a merit basis based on final league position, the top club getting twenty times as much as the bottom club, and equal steps all the way down the table; the final quarter is paid out as facilities fees for games that are shown on television, with the top clubs generally receiving the largest shares of this. The income from overseas rights is divided equally between the twenty clubs.[161] Not all Premier League matches are televised in the United Kingdom, as the league upholds the long-standing prohibition on telecasts of any association football match (domestic or otherwise) that kicks off between 2:45 p.m. and 5:15 p.m. on Saturday matchdays.[162][163][164] The first Sky television rights agreement was worth £304 million over five seasons.[165] The next contract, negotiated to start from the 1997–98 season, rose to £670 million over four seasons.[165] The third contract was a £1.024 billion deal with BSkyB for the three seasons from 2001 to 2004. The league brought in £320 million from the sale of its international rights for the three-year period from 2004 to 2007. It sold the rights itself on a territory-by-territory basis.[166] Sky's monopoly was broken from August 2006 when Setanta Sports was awarded rights to show two out of the six packages of matches available. This occurred following an insistence by the European Commission that exclusive rights should not be sold to one television company. Sky and Setanta paid £1.7 billion, a two-thirds increase which took many commentators by surprise as it had been widely assumed that the value of the rights had levelled off following many years of rapid growth. Setanta also hold rights to a live 3 pm match solely for Irish viewers. The BBC retained the rights to show highlights for the same three seasons (on Match of the Day) for £171.6 million, a 63 per cent increase on the £105 million it paid for the previous three-year period.[167] Sky and BT Group (via its new channel BT Sport, now TNT Sports) agreed to jointly pay £84.3 million for delayed television rights to 242 games (that is the right to broadcast them in full on television and over the internet) in most cases for a period of 50 hours after 10 p.m. on matchday.[168] Overseas television rights fetched £625 million, nearly double the previous contract.[169] The total raised from those deals was more than £2.7 billion, giving Premier League clubs an average media income from league games of around £40 million-a-year from 2007 to 2010.[170] The TV rights agreement between the Premier League and Sky faced accusations of being a cartel, and a number of court cases arose as a result.[171] An investigation by the Office of Fair Trading in 2002 found BSkyB to be dominant within the pay TV sports market, but concluded that there were insufficient grounds for the claim that BSkyB had abused its dominant position.[172] In July 1999 the Premier League's method of selling rights collectively for all member clubs was investigated by the UK Restrictive Practices Court, which concluded that the agreement was not contrary to the public interest.[173] The BBC's highlights package on Saturday and Sunday nights, as well as other evenings when fixtures justify, ran until 2016.[174] Television rights alone for the period 2010 to 2013 were purchased for £1.782 billion.[175] On 22 June 2009, due to troubles encountered by Setanta Sports after it failed to meet a final deadline over a £30 million payment to the Premier League, ESPN was awarded two packages of UK rights containing 46 matches that were available for the 2009–10 season as well as a package of 23 matches per season from 2010 to 2013.[176] On 13 June 2012, the Premier League announced that BT had been awarded 38 games a season for the 2013–14, 2014–15 and 2015–16 seasons at £246 million-a-year. The remaining 116 games were retained by Sky, which paid £760 million-a-year. The total domestic rights raised £3.018 billion, an increase of 70.2% over the 2010–11 to 2012–13 rights.[177] The value of the licensing deal rose by another 70.2% in 2015, when Sky and BT paid £5.136 billion to renew their contracts with the Premier League for another three years up to the 2018–19 season.[178] A new rights cycle began in the 2019–20 season, with the domestic package increasing to 200 matches overall; in February 2018, BT were awarded the package of 32 lunchtime fixtures on Saturdays, whilst Sky was awarded four of the seven packages, covering the majority of weekend fixtures (including eight new prime time fixtures on Saturdays), as well as Monday and Friday matches. Two remaining packages of 20 fixtures each were to be sold at a later date, including three rounds of mid-week fixtures and a bank holiday round. As Sky already owned the maximum number of matches it could hold without breaching a 148-match cap, it was speculated that at least one of the new packages could go to a new entrant, such as a streaming service. The five packages sold to BT and Sky were valued at £4.464 billion.[179] In June 2018, it was announced that Amazon Prime Video and BT had acquired the remaining two packages; Amazon acquired rights to 20 matches per-season, covering a mid-week round in December, and all Boxing Day fixtures.[180] The Amazon telecasts are produced in association with Sunset + Vine and BT Sport.[181] With the resumption of play in the 2019–20 Premier League due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, the Premier League announced that all remaining matches would be carried on British television, split primarily across Sky, BT, and Amazon. A large number of these matches were also scheduled for free-to-air broadcasts, with Sky airing 25 on Pick, Amazon streaming its four matches on Twitch, and the BBC – for the first time in league history – carrying four live matches.[182][183][184][185] As matches would continue to be played without spectators upon the start of the 2020–21 Premier League, its clubs voted on 8 September to continue broadcasting all matches through at least September (with the BBC and Amazon each holding one additional match), and \"appropriate arrangements\" being made for October.[186][187] It was later announced that matches not selected for broadcast would be carried on pay-per-view via BT Sport Box Office and Sky Box Office at a cost of £14.95 per-match. The PPV scheme was poorly received; the Football Supporters' Federation felt that the price was too high, and there were concerns that it could encourage piracy. There were calls from supporters to boycott the pay-per-views, and make donations to support charitable causes instead (with Newcastle's \"Charity Not PPV\" campaign raising £20,000 for a local food bank, and Arsenal fans raising £34,000 for Islington Giving). On 13 November, amid the reintroduction of measures across the UK, the Premier League officially announced that the non-televised matches would be assigned to its main broadcast partners, and again including additional matches for the BBC and Amazon Prime.[188][189][190][191] The next cycle of rights between 2022–23 and 2024–25 season was renewed without tender due to compelling and exceptional circumstances in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, rights remained as they were since the 2019–20 season.[192] UK highlights In August 2016, it was announced the BBC would be creating a new magazine-style show for the Premier League entitled The Premier League Show.[193] The Premier League is the most-watched football league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people.[9] The Premier League's production arm, Premier League Productions, is operated by IMG Productions and produces content for its international television partners.[194] On 22 November 2024, the Premier League announced plans to end its agreement with IMG and take Premier League Productions in-house beginning in 2026–27.[195] The Premier League is the most widely distributed sports programme in Asia.[196] In the Indian subcontinent, the matches are broadcast live on STAR Sports.[197] In MENA region, BeIN Sports holds exclusive rights to the Premier League.[198] In China, the broadcast rights were awarded to iQiyi, Migu and CCTV that began in the 2021–22 season.[199][200][201] SCTV broadcast the matches for Indonesia, and Astro for Malaysia. In Australia, Optus telecommunications holds exclusive rights to the Premier League, providing live broadcasts and online access (Fox Sports formerly held rights).[202] As of the 2022–23 season, Canadian media rights to the Premier League are owned by FuboTV,[203] after having been jointly owned by Sportsnet and TSN, and most recently DAZN.[204] The Premier League is broadcast in the United States by NBC Sports, a division of Sky parent Comcast.[205] Acquiring the rights to the Premier League in 2013 (replacing Fox Soccer and ESPN), NBC Sports has been widely praised for its coverage.[206][207][208] NBC Sports reached a six-year extension with the Premier League in 2015 to broadcast the league until the end of the 2021–22 season in a deal valued at $1 billion (£640 million).[209][210] In November 2021, NBC reached another six-year extension through 2028 in a deal valued at $2.76 billion (£2 billion).[211][212] The Premier League is broadcast by SuperSport across sub-Saharan Africa.[213] Broadcasters to continental Europe until 2025 include Canal+ for France,[214] Sky Sport Germany for Germany and Austria,[215] Match TV for Russia,[216] Sky Sport Italy for Italy,[217] Eleven Sports for Portugal,[218] DAZN for Spain,[219] beIN Sports Turkey to Turkey,[220] Digi Sport for Romania,[221] and NENT to Nordic countries (Sweden, Denmark and Norway),[222] Poland and the Netherlands.[223] In South America, ESPN covers much of the continent,[224] with coverage in Brazil shared between ESPN Brasil and ESPN4.[225][226] Paramount+ broadcasts the league in Central America.[227] As of the 2023–24 season, Premier League football has been played in 61 stadiums since the formation of the division.[228] The Hillsborough disaster in 1989 and the subsequent Taylor Report saw a recommendation that standing terraces should be abolished. As a result, all stadiums in the Premier League are all-seater.[229][230] Since the formation of the Premier League, football grounds in England have seen constant improvements to capacity and facilities, with some clubs moving to new-build stadiums.[231] Eleven stadiums that have seen Premier League football have now been demolished. The stadiums for the 2023–24 season show a large disparity in capacity. For example, Old Trafford, the home of Manchester United, has a capacity of 74,031 whilst Dean Court, the home of Bournemouth, has a capacity of 11,307. The combined total capacity of the Premier League in the 2023–24 season is 787,002 with an average capacity of 39,350. Stadium attendances are a significant source of regular income for Premier League clubs.[232] For the 2022–23 season, average attendances across the league clubs were 40,235 for Premier League matches with an aggregate attendance of 15,289,340.[233] This represents an increase of 19,109 from the average attendance of 21,126 recorded in the Premier League's first season (1992–93).[234] However, during the 1992–93 season, the capacities of most stadiums were reduced as clubs replaced terraces with seats in order to meet the Taylor Report's 1994–95 deadline for all-seater stadiums.[235][236] The 2022–23 season also set a competition record for total attendance with more than 15 million spectators, with average attendance also reaching record levels, surpassing the previous record of 39,989 set in the 2021–22 season, which in turn broke over 70 years old record set in 1948–49 season.[237] In October 2024 it was reported that the government is planning to grant the independent regulator authority to stop Premier League clubs from selling their stadiums to affiliated or third-party companies.[238] I have never known this level before. Of course, there are managers in Germany, Italy, and Spain, but in the Premier League, these are the best managers, the elite managers. The quality, the preparation. The level is so high. Managers in the Premier League are involved in the day-to-day running of the team, including the training, team selection and player acquisition. Their influence varies from club-to-club and is related to the ownership of the club and the relationship of the manager with fans.[240] Managers are required to have a UEFA Pro Licence which is the final coaching qualification available, and follows the completion of the UEFA 'B' and 'A' Licences.[241] The UEFA Pro Licence is required by every person who wishes to manage a club in the Premier League on a permanent basis (i.e., more than 12 weeks, the amount of time an unqualified caretaker manager is allowed to take control).[242] Caretaker appointments are managers that fill the gap between a managerial departure and a new appointment. Several caretaker managers have gone on to secure a permanent managerial post after performing well as a caretaker, including Paul Hart at Portsmouth, David Pleat at Tottenham Hotspur and Ole Gunnar Solskjær at Manchester United. Arsène Wenger is the longest-serving manager, having been in charge of Arsenal in the Premier League from 1996 to his departure at the conclusion of the 2017–18 season, and holds the record for most matches managed in the Premier League with 828, all with Arsenal. He broke the record set by Alex Ferguson, who had managed 810 matches with Manchester United from the Premier League's inception to his retirement at the end of the 2012–13 season. Ferguson was in charge of Manchester United from November 1986 until his retirement at the end of the 2012–13 season, meaning he was manager for the last five years of the old Football League First Division and all of the first 21 seasons of the Premier League.[243] Notably, since its creation the Premier League has never been won by an English manager. There have been several studies into the reasoning behind, and effects of, managerial sackings. Most famously, Sue Bridgewater of the University of Liverpool and Bas ter Weel of the University of Amsterdam, performed two separate studies which helped to explain the statistics behind managerial sackings. Bridgewater's study found clubs generally sack their managers upon dropping below an average of one point per match.[244] Player transfers may only take place within transfer windows set by the Football Association. The two transfer windows run from the last day of the season to 31 August and from 31 December to 31 January. Player registrations cannot be exchanged outside these windows except under specific licence from the FA, usually on an emergency basis.[246] As of the 2010–11 season, the Premier League introduced new rules mandating that each club must register a maximum 25-man squad of players aged over 21, with the squad list only allowed to be changed in transfer windows or in exceptional circumstances.[247][248] This was to enable the \"home grown\" rule to be enacted, whereby the Premier League would also from 2010 require at least eight members of the named 25-man squad to be \"home-grown players\".[247] At the inception of the Premier League in 1992–93, just 11 players named in the starting line-ups for the first round of matches hailed from outside of the United Kingdom or Ireland.[249] By 2000–01, the number of foreign players participating in the Premier League was 36% of the total. In the 2004–05 season, the figure had increased to 45%. On 26 December 1999, Chelsea became the first Premier League side to field an entirely foreign starting line-up,[250] and on 14 February 2005, Arsenal were the first to name a completely foreign 16-man squad for a match.[251] By 2009, under 40% of the players in the Premier League were English.[252] By February 2020, 117 different nationalities had played in the Premier League, and 101 nationalities had scored in the competition.[253] In 1999, in response to concerns that clubs were increasingly passing over young English players in favour of foreign players, the Home Office tightened its rules for granting work permits to players from countries outside of the European Union.[254] A non-EU player applying for the permit must have played for his country in at least 75 per cent of its competitive 'A' team matches for which he was available for selection during the previous two years, and his country must have averaged at least 70th place in the official FIFA world rankings over the previous two years. If a player does not meet those criteria, the club wishing to sign him may appeal.[255] Following the implementation of Brexit in January 2021, new regulations were introduced which require all foreign players to obtain a Governing Body Endorsement (GBE) in order to play football in the United Kingdom, regardless of EU status.[256] Italics denotes players still playing professional football,Bold denotes players still playing in the Premier League. The Premier League Golden Boot is awarded each season to the top scorer in the division. Former Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United striker Alan Shearer holds the record for most Premier League goals with 260.[258] Thirty-three players have reached the 100-goal mark.[259] Since the first Premier League season in 1992–93, 23 players from 11 clubs have won or shared the top scorer title.[260] Thierry Henry won his fourth overall scoring title by scoring 27 goals in the 2005–06 season. Erling Haaland holds the record for most goals in a Premier League season (38 matches) with 36 goals as of 15 May 2023.[261] Ryan Giggs of Manchester United holds the record for scoring goals in consecutive seasons, having scored in the first 21 seasons of the league.[262] Giggs also holds the record for the most Premier League assists, with 162.[263] There is no team or individual salary cap in the Premier League. As a result of the increasingly lucrative television deals, player wages rose sharply following the formation of the Premier League, when the average player wage was £75,000 per year.[264] In the 2018–19 season the average annual salary stood at £2.99 million. The total salary bill for the 20 Premier League clubs in the 2018–19 season was £1.62 billion; this compares to £1.05 billion in La Liga, £0.83 billion in Serie A, £0.72 billion in Bundesliga, and £0.54 billion in Ligue 1. The club with the highest average wage is Manchester United at £6.5 million. This is smaller than the club with the highest wage bill in Spain (Barcelona £10.5 million) and Italy (Juventus £6.7 million), but higher than in Germany (Bayern Munich £6.4 million) and France (Paris Saint-Germain £6.1 million). For the 2018–19 season, the ratio of the wages of the highest-paid team to lowest-paid in the Premier League is 6.82 to 1. This is much lower than in La Liga (19.1 to 1), Serie A (16 to 1), Bundesliga (20.5 to 1), and Ligue 1 (26.6 to 1). Because of the lower differential between team wage bills in the Premier League, it is often regarded as being more competitive than other top European leagues.[265] The record transfer fee for a Premier League player has risen steadily over the lifetime of the competition. Before the start of the first Premier League season, Alan Shearer became the first British player to command a transfer fee of more than £3 million.[266] The record has increased steadily and Enzo Fernández is now the most expensive transfer fee paid by a Premier League club at £106.8 million, whilst Philippe Coutinho is the biggest transfer involving a Premier League club at £105 million. The Premier League maintains two trophies – the genuine trophy (held by the reigning champions) and a spare replica. Two trophies are held for the purpose of making the award within minutes of the title being secured, in the event that on the final day of the season two clubs are still within reach of winning the League.[293] In the rare event that more than two clubs are vying for the title on the final day of the season, a replica won by a previous club is used.[294] The current Premier League trophy was created by Royal Jewellers Garrard & Co/Asprey of London and was designed in house at Garrard & Co by Trevor Brown and Paul Marsden. It consists of a trophy with a golden crown and a malachite plinth base. The plinth weighs 33 pounds (15 kg) and the trophy weighs 22 pounds (10.0 kg).[295] The trophy and plinth are 76 cm (30 in) tall, 43 cm (17 in) wide and 25 cm (9.8 in) deep.[296] Its main body is solid sterling silver and silver gilt, whilst its plinth is made of malachite, a semi-precious stone. The plinth has a silver band around its circumference, upon which the names of the title-winning clubs are listed. The green of the malachite represents the green field of play.[296] The design of the trophy is based on the heraldry of Three Lions that is associated with English football. Two of the lions are found above the handles on either side of the trophy – the third is symbolised by the captain of the title-winning team as he raises the trophy, and its gold crown, above his head at the end of the season.[297] The ribbons that drape the handles are presented in the team colours of the league champions that year. In 2004, a special gold version of the trophy was commissioned to commemorate Arsenal winning the title without a single defeat.[298] In addition to the winner's trophy and the individual winner's medals awarded to players who win the title, the Premier League also issues other awards throughout the season. A man-of-the-match award is awarded to the player who has the greatest impact in an individual match. Monthly awards are also given for the Manager of the Month, Player of the Month and Goal of the Month.[299] These are also issued annually for Manager of the Season,[300] Player of the Season[301] and Goal of the Season. The Young Player of the Season award is given to the most outstanding U-23 player starting from the 2019–20 season.[302] The Golden Boot award is given to the top goalscorer of every season, the Playmaker of the Season award is given to the player who makes the most assists of every season,[141] and the Golden Glove award is given to the goalkeeper with the most clean sheets at the end of the season.[303] Starting with the 2021–22 season, four new awards are given. The Save of the Season is awarded to the goalkeeper deemed to have made the most impressive save.[304] The Game Changer of the Season is earned by the player with the single most game-changing performance over the course of the campaign.[305] The Most Powerful Goal is given to the player whose goal-scoring shot had the highest average velocity from the time it was struck to the time it crossed the goal line, and the Most Improbable Comeback award is meant for the team that, based on calculations performed by Oracle Corporation, goes behind and overcomes a deficit to win their respective match.[306] From the 2017–18 season, players receive a milestone award for 100 appearances and every century there after and also players who score 50 goals and multiples thereof. Each player to reach these milestones is to receive a presentation box from the Premier League containing a special medallion and a plaque commemorating their achievement.[307] In 2012, the Premier League celebrated its second decade by holding the 20 Seasons Awards:[308] Bibliography",

Pep Guardiola's reigning Premier League champions have now won just one in their past 13 games across all competitions but started with plenty of verve and led in the 14th minute when Bernardo Silva slid home Jeremy Doku's pass via a deflection off Jarrad Branthwaite. Silva, captaining City as Kyle Walker sat out this one through illness to compound a weighty absentees list, should have doubled the lead after the half-hour when Phil Foden set him up to drive a venomous shot past the post. As they have so often during their remarkable downturn, Guardiola's team were made to pay for their profligacy. Manuel Akanji and Rico Lewis were unable to deal with a cross Abdoulaye Doucoure had an age to make and Iliman Ndiaye produced a delightful finish with the outside of his right boot. Venue: Etihad Stadium, ManchesterReferee: Simon Hooper Keep track of every game and every goal via SN's live Premier League scoreboard Starting Lineups: Man City (3-2-4-1, right to left): 18. Stefan Ortega (GK) — 25. Manuel Akanji, 6. Nathan Ake, 24. Josko Gvardiol — 82. Rico Lewis, 8. Mateo Kovacic — 26. Savinho, 20. Bernardo Silva, 47. Phil Foden, 11. Jeremy Doku (17. Kevin De Bruyne) — 9. Erling Haaland Everton (4-3-3, right to left): 1. Jordan Pickford (GK) — 23. Seamus Coleman (2. Nathan Patterson), 6. James Tarkowski, 32. Jarrad Branthwaite, 19. Vitaliy Mykolenko — 8. Orel Mangala, 27. Idrissa Gueye, 16. Abdoulaye Doucoure — 11. Jack Harrison, 9. Dominic Calvert-Lewin (22. Armando Broja), 10. Iliman Ndiaye (29. Jesper Lindstrom) Latest live updates | Team news and lineups | Where to watch where you are City began the second half in an attacking frenzy and looked set to be rewarded when the haphazard Vitaliy Mykolenko brought down Savinho in the 51st minute. The Ukraine full-back not receiving a second booking looked like it might be Everton's biggest reprieve of that flashpoint but Pickford outwitted Haaland, guessing correctly to his right to keep out a well-struck kick that was not close enough to the corner. Haaland headed home when Savinho got to the rebound but had strayed offside and the Norwegian's aerial play in the area was perplexing thereafter following another confidence-sapping moment. The torpid state of City's self-belief was on show as the more they strained for a winner, the more they left themselves exposed to an Everton sucker punch. Doucoure and Orel Mangala had effort deflated just wide and Jack Harrison passed up a great counter-attacking opportunity in stoppage time. Guardiola's quest for answers goes on. Latest live updates | Team news and lineups | Where to watch where you are Jordan Pickford's save from Erling Haaland's second-half penalty was the pivotal moment in this 1-1 draw. The City striker is the first player down the tunnel, he looks absolutely bereft. City were pretty good up until that point, with Iliman Ndiaye's fine equaliser coming against the run of play. But after the penalty miss all the collapsing confidence and mounting doubt from their slumpo of one win in 13 was on show. A more incisive opponent probably would have punished it, but Sean Dyche would gladly have taken a point apiece from their recent run of games against Arsenal, Chelsea and City when the fixtures came out. 90+5 mins: Everton break. They have men over! Ajkanji stands up to Harrison's shot. 90+4 mins: Foden looks to flip a ball over the Everton defence. Branthwaite deals with it and Foden makes absolutely sure Broja won't break by almost pulling his shorts down. A slapstick booking. 90+3 mins: Everton break. Here's Gueye. His cross is deflected behind. Offside. Stand down. City have the ball again. 90+1 mins: Lewis lets fly from outside the box but it's over. 90 mins: Six added minutes for either team to find a winner as Everton clear another City corner. 87 mins: Branthwaite clatters through Savinho, advantage played but De Bruyne can't make the cross with Haaland and Foden queueing up. 85 mins: Simpson-Pusey and Gundogan on for Ake and Kovacic for City. 83 mins: ALMOST 2-1 TO EVERTON! A thundering strike from Mangala takes a wicked deflection and flies wide with Ortega rooted. The corner is deep towards Tarkowski and teh City goalkeeper claims his header. 76 mins: Branthwaite makes a brilliant and vital tackle on Haaland on halfway but he's down in pain. It looked like City's No. 9 inadvertently trod on him. Quite frankly, that an awful lot of human to put their weight on you. 74 mins: Gvardiol has a shot blocked from outside the box. That looked like a team running out of ideas. Handily for City, here comes Kevin De Bruyne - a man with plenty of them. His compatriot Jeremy Doku makes way. Looks like Foden will come out to play on the left wing. 69 mins: Almost 2-1 to Everton! A well-constructed break ends with Harrison's cross finding Doucoure, who back-post effort is deflected behind by Lewis. The corner is absolutely rubbish and almost goes out for a throw. The excellent Calvert-Lewin makes way for Broja. The City fans sing for Kevin De Bruyne. 68 mins: Haaland grapples successfully with Branthwaite to keep a City attack alive. Lewis slides a pass towards the No. 9 but he's not on the same wavelength. 66 mins: Foden finds Haaland in the box but again he lacks his usual conviction. They come again but Savinho duffs a tame shot over the far post. City are playing well despite grappling with their own vanishing self-belief. It all makes for quite compelling viewing. 64 mins: Ake makes a brilliant last-ditch take as Calvert-Lewin looks to dart through on goal. This game is being played more and more in transitions and that suits Everton. 63 mins: Kovacic shoots but it's blocked because he wanted too many touches. 61 mins: Doku goes on a FIFA dribble entirely outside of this game's context and pierces into the Everton box. They scramble away as far as Silva, whose shot is blocked. 60 mins: Savinho seems to want Mykolenko for a second Christmas lunch. He wins a corner off the beleaguered full-back. Gvardiol prods over at the near post on the volley. Kevin De Bruyne is warming up. 58 mins: Tarkowski fouls Silva and that's a bit of a waste from an Everton point of view. 57 mins: Nice combination play from Ndiaye and Calvert-Lewin. Ake is equal to it. Everton corner. 53 mins: PICKFORD SAVES!!!!!!!!! The shot is hard and low but not in the corner and Pickford saves down to his right. The punchline for City? Savinho gets to the rebound, diverts it across goal for Haaland to head home... he's offside. 51 mins: PENALTY TO CITY! Mykolenko has been on the waltzers against Savinho all afternoon and brings him down. No second booking, Haaland to take. 50 mins: Silva wins a corner and takes it quickly. Haaland up at the back post, falls to Savinho... brilliant save from Pickford with his boot. Now Kovacic... just wide. 49 mins: Haaland gets up to Savinhos latest cross but can only nod across goal. City camped around the Everton box. 47 mins: Gvardiol gets a glancing touch on Foden's latest corner but Everton are able to hack out of the goalmouth. Silva who opened the scoring, gets us back underway. The next goal in this one feels huge. Gvardiol blocks Harrison's cross behind with his face. Not pleasant on a cold day. Calvert-Lewin heads over and that's that. City have been pretty good here, have gone ahead again but are no longer winning. The sort of stuff that gnaws at a the confidence of a team in their predicament and Everton have definitely warmed to their task. 45 mins: Kovacic...Haaland...Foden! Coleman slides in heroically. Another corner. This one is straight into Pickford's gloves. We'll have one added minute. 44 mins: The ball falls to Savinho from the set piece, who hits a rasping one that's blocked. 43 mins: Free-kiock into the wall. Akanji lumps a dicey pass to Lewis, who does well to keep his cool. Forward come the hosts again. Coleman thwarts Doku, now it's another corner. 42 mins: Brainless from Everton as a free-kick is clumped from halfway, Haaland wins the header and Silva releases Doku. He's fouled on the edge of the box by Mykolenko, who's booked. Foden over it. 41 mins: Ndiaye now gets all the way back to the left-back position and does as good a job of defending Savinho as anyone has today. He's had some five minutes. 40 mins: Everton come forward again, sensing the suffocating nervousness inside the Etihad. Ndiaye drives across goal but it comes to nought. 36 mins: GOOOOOAAAAAAALLLLLL!!!!!!! Iliman Ndiaye!!!!!!!! And that's what happens when you don't take your chances! City deal with the initial cross from Coleman but Everotn keep the attack alive. Doucoure's cross gets a a faint touch from Akanji, which takes Lewis out of the equation and Ndiaye finds an accomplished finish for his third Premier League goal of the season and first since mid-October. A special finish!Iliman Ndiaye has Everton level at the Etihad! 👀#PLonPrime #MCIEVE pic.twitter.com/RJhXeDq0YK 33 mins: OH, SHOULD BE 2-0 TO CITY! Haaland does well to collect a second ball, Foden squares to Silva, who is suddenly in oceans of space. He looks to drive a lavish outside-of-the-foot finish across Pickford, who looks on and pays and sees the ball whistle just past his left upright. Pep Guardiola's reaction to this Bernardo Silva chance says it all! 😲#PLonPrime #MCIEVE pic.twitter.com/SRL6gAe2EH 30 mins: Savinho on the charge again. He shoots this time as the Everton bodies converge and Pickford collects a looping ball near his goalline. It's impressive from the Brazil winger but he still needs to be more decisive in the final third. 28 mins: Everton corner from very little. Ndiaye's left-wing delivery is cleared at the near post. Gueye catches a shot sweetly from the edge of the box but Ortega is behind it all the way. 26 mins: Silva pings one over the Everton line for Haaland. He can't quite get it under his spell and Pickford does superbly. That said, you sense that a Haaland anywhere near top form would have probably made it 2-0. 23 mins: Foden slips a pass through to Haaland. There's maybe a bit too much on it, he rounds Pickford but the angle is then prohibitive and Branthwaite clears behind. Foden over the corner and Ake heads over at the near post. 21 mins: That's what Ecerton want. Calvert-Lewin smartly chests down a long ball forward, brining the support attackers into play. Ndiaye lays the ball back to Mangala 25 yards out. The midfielder curls high and wide of the target. 19 mins: Foden over a City free-kick. He drops an absolutely doozy of a Christmas gift onto the six-yard line. Ribbon, glittery paper, all sorts. No one is there to convert. 14 mins: GOOOOOOAAAAAAALLLLLLLLL!!!!!! Bernardo Silva!!!!!! Doku pulls out to the touchline and plays a wall pass to Silva. A classic Guardiola team move. The Portugal midfielder's scrapping qualities come to the fore as a he slides with the hulking Branthwaite and diverts a finish beyond Pickford into the far corner. Perfectly-timed run, and a fortuitous Bernardo Silva finish! ⚽️🔵Man City score the first goal of Boxing Day!#PLonPrime #MCIEVE pic.twitter.com/Et0IRU7nyL 13 mins: Savinho darting inside once more but he won't cut the trigger, much to the crowd's chagrin. At the other end, Gvardiol just played the hosts into a spot of bother, which gave Ake a chance to test his recently repaired hamstring. Something he may or may not appreciate. 12 mins: Lewis feeds Savinho, who leaves Mykolenko on his backside, The ball breaks for Haaland but onto his weaker right foot and the shot is blocked. 10 mins: This has perhaps predictably settled into attacks vs. defence, cat-and-mouse fayre. Everton packed behind the ball but their defensive line leaving just enough encouragement for City to try a little chip over for Haaland. Here's one and Pickford gathers. 6 mins: Silva is twice careless in possession in midfield and Everton get away the second time. Calvert-Lewin can't get on the end of Harrison's searching cross as he is well marshalled by Akanji and Ake. 4 mins: Now some fancy footwork from Savinho before Pickford pouches his low cross. The home faithful provide a full-throated response. 3 mins: Both City full-backs are pegged wide, leaving Mateo Kovacic to deal with the base of the midfield alone. The Croatian does that tidily before Savinho has a shot blocked. Coleman concedes a corner. Taken short, Foden dinks a cross... Gvardiol heads against the post! 2 mins: Everton look to go direct when a City attack breaks down following Gvardiol's misplaced pass but Calvert-Lewin is offside. We just observed a minute's silence for those associated with both clubs who have passed away during 2024, including ex-Everton striker Kevin Campbell and former City boss Sven-Goran Eriksson. Everton to kickoff and Gueye gets us underway. 5 mins before kickoff: Here they come, out into the cold and drizzle. Can City warm their fans spirits with a much-needed win or are Everton about to frustrate another of the Premier League's big hitters? 10 mins before kickoff: It's a foul day in east Manchester. Kickoff not far away but plenty of fans in both the bome and away sections appear to be sheltering indoors until the last possible moment. 🏡🩵 pic.twitter.com/EoF7cv45r0 30 mins before kickoff: Erling Haaland was pretty scathing of his own performances after City suffered their latest defeat at Aston Villa last time out. The big Norwegian has scored just three times in his past 12 Premier League games, while Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford has kept five clean sheets in his past six matches to lead the Golden Glove standings. Haaland scored both goals as City battled to a 2-0 win over an obdurate Everton in this fixture last season and it feels inevitable that he and Pickford will have a key say over the destination of the points this afternoon. 1 hour before kickoff: Here's the Everton side in full. Ashley Young's suspension means a first start since August for club captain Seamus Coleman. Doku and Savinho each starting for City with their capacity to switch wings could mean a lively lunchtime for the veteran. I'm sure he'll take it all in his stride. Your Toffees to face @ManCity!🔵 #MCIEVE pic.twitter.com/khQ4ayhIbK 1 hr 15 mins before kickoff: The teams are in and City have more fitness woes. Jack Grealish has a minor injury and Kyle Walker is ill. Both are not involved. Nathan Ake is back from a hamstring straight and starts, which feels risky for his long-term fitness, but needs must. Savinho and Jeremy Doku each start on the wings to prospectively add a little more verve and service Erling Haaland with a working supply line.

Of course, the City manager would never say that it loud and, in his programme notes for today's game, discussed the toughness and threat his side will face from Everton in glowing terms. However, his head-to-head with Dyche across the latter's spells with Burnley and Everton reads P17 W16 D1 L0 with 52 goals scored. Some of those games were tight, such as City's suffocatingly tense 1-0 win at Turf Moor during the 2018/19 title run-in, but some...weren't. There are four 5-0s in this selection and a couple of 4-1s. FULL-TIME Burnley 0-1 Man CitySergio Aguero’s 20th #PL goal of the season gets the champions over the line and back on top of the table#BURMCI pic.twitter.com/JoemAmvYgb 1 hr 40 mins before kickoff: Everton boss Sean Dyche has seen his team shutout title-chasing Arsenal and Chelsea in their past two games. Unsurprisingly, he fancies the assignment against a City team who have become increasingly gunshy around the opposition box and brittle at the other end during their sapping slump. Speaking before the match, Dyche tapped into the creeping end-of-empire feel that has started to gather around the Etihad Stadium over these hard winter months. You go there to win anyway but when the facts and stats start ­changing they add belief. That’s just the way sport works. If a team starts suffering a little bit then it adds belief to whoever is going there. Remember under Sir Alex when people went to Old Trafford? Even when they were down you would think they’d score in Fergie time. But once that started to break down a little bit people started to believe they could have a go. It’s not down to one team or one result, it’s down to that feel, and that is what changes. If we can capitalise on that then great, but it’s not that easy. They are still a top-class bunch of players. 2 hours before kickoff: Welcome to another blockbuster Boxing Day! Man City trained on Christmas Day in a bid to be primed and ready for the visit of Everton, with Guardiola and his players desperate for an upturn in performances and results. 💬 @ErlingHaaland's post-match reflection. The match kicks off in Manchester, UK at 12:30 p.m. local time. Here's how that time translates across some of the major territories: City are without Ruben Dias and John Stones, meaning Nathan Ake (hamstring) is the latest man to be haphazardly rushed back into a light and creaking backline. Goalkeeper Ederson missed the Villa Park trip — Guardiola said he did \"not feel good\" — and Matheus Nunes is also still out. They are joined on the sidelines by Kyle Walker (illness) and Jack Grealish (knock). Kevin De Bruyne did not get off the bench last time out and is among the substitutes again, where he and Ilkay Gundogan account for almost all of the senior football experience at Guardiola's disposla.

                "content": "Theodore Edmond Bridgewater Jr.[1] (born November 10, 1992) is an American professional football quarterback for the Detroit Lions of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Louisville Cardinals, winning the 2013 Sugar Bowl, and was selected as the final first round pick of the 2014 NFL draft by the Minnesota Vikings. During his second season, Bridgewater led the Vikings to a division title and earned Pro Bowl honors. Upon suffering a severe leg injury the following offseason, Bridgewater appeared in only one game over the next two years. Bridgewater joined the New Orleans Saints in 2018 as a backup, but served as the team's starter in relief of Drew Brees and helped contribute to them winning their conference's top seed. He later held starting roles with the Carolina Panthers and Denver Broncos for one season each and spent his last two seasons as a backup for the Miami Dolphins and Detroit Lions. After initially retiring from the NFL in 2023, Bridgewater became the head football coach at Miami Northwestern, his former high school. Bridgewater returned to the Detroit Lions in 2024 after leading Miami Northwestern to a state championship. The son of Teddy Bridgewater Sr. and Rose Murphy, Bridgewater was born in Miami, Florida, on November 10, 1992. He attended Miami Northwestern Senior High School.[2] The school's football field was later renamed in his honor.[3] In his sophomore year, Bridgewater replaced Jacory Harris as starting quarterback and took over a team that had been named the 2007 national champions by USA Today. Bridgewater completed 97 of 160 attempts (60.6 percent) for 1,560 yards over the season, throwing 16 touchdowns with three interceptions. He also carried 45 times for 211 yards (4.7 average) and two more scores. Northwestern finished the season 13–3, falling short to Seminole High School of Sanford 28–21 in the 6A state title game.[4] As a junior, Bridgewater passed for 2,546 yards and 32 touchdowns and rushed for 379 yards and five more scores. In a late-September game against Hialeah-Miami Lakes High School, he completed 19 of 24 passes for 327 yards and a Dade County record of seven touchdowns.[5] Bridgewater was named second-team All-State for 6A classification and first-team All-County by the Miami Herald. Northwestern finished the season 10–2, after a 29–16 loss to rival Miami Central High School. As a senior, Bridgewater had 2,606 passing yards and 22 touchdowns despite missing parts of the season with a medial collateral ligament injury. He also rushed for 223 yards and eight more scores. Northwestern had a 9–3 record for the season, losing 42–27 to Miami Central in the 6-A semifinals, in which he threw for 436 yards and scored four touchdowns. Regarded as a four-star recruit, Bridgewater was considered the sixth best dual-threat quarterback prospect in the nation by Rivals.com.[6] He played in the 2011 U.S. Army All-American Bowl.[7] Bridgewater originally committed to the University of Miami in June 2010.[8] However, after the firing of Miami head coach Randy Shannon in November 2010, Bridgewater switched his commitment to the University of Louisville.[9] Sources: As a freshman at Louisville in 2011, Bridgewater entered the season as a backup to Will Stein. However, by the Cardinals' fourth game of the season against Marshall, he was starting and remained the starter the rest of the year.[10][11] Bridgewater finished the season completing 191 of 296 passes for 2,129 yards, 14 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions.[12] For his play, Bridgewater was named the Big East Rookie of the Year and was named a freshman All-American by Rivals.com, Scout.com, CBS Sports, and Sporting News.[13][14][15][16][17] As a sophomore in 2012, Bridgewater started 11 of 12 regular season games. In his only non-starting action, coming off the bench while injured against Rutgers, Bridgewater led his team to a win, a Big East title, and a berth to the BCS.[18] He finished the regular season completing 267-of-387 passes for 3,452 yards, 25 touchdowns, and just seven interceptions.[19] Bridgewater finished sixth in the nation in completion percentage, eighth in yards per attempt, and seventh in passing efficiency. For his play, Bridgewater was named the Big East Offensive Player of the Year.[20] The Cardinals entered the 2013 Sugar Bowl against the Florida Gators as decided underdogs.[21][22] Although Florida boasted the nation's #1 pass efficiency defense,[23] Bridgewater passed for 266 yards and two touchdowns to become the game's MVP during a 33–23 victory.[24] As a junior in 2013, Bridgewater completed 303-of-427 passes for 3,970 yards, 31 touchdowns, and four interceptions.[25] In his final college game against the Miami Hurricanes in the 2013 Russell Athletic Bowl, Bridgewater completed 35-of-42 passes for 447 yards three touchdowns and was named the game's MVP.[26][27] As early as April 2013, Bridgewater was seen as one of the top prospects for the 2014 NFL draft, alongside Jadeveon Clowney and Johnny Manziel. Reports said that, had Bridgewater been eligible for the 2013 Draft, he most likely would have been the first quarterback taken.[28] At one point, he was projected by many to be the first overall pick in the draft.[29][30] On January 1, 2014, Bridgewater announced that he would forgo his final year of eligibility at Louisville.[31] Bridgewater was selected by the Minnesota Vikings as the 32nd and final pick of the first round of the draft.[35] The Vikings had traded their second round and fourth round picks to the Seattle Seahawks to move up and select Bridgewater.[36] He signed a four-year contract worth $6.85 million with a $3.3 million signing bonus with the Vikings.[37] Bridgewater entered the season as the second-string quarterback, behind veteran Matt Cassel, but ahead of Christian Ponder.[38] Bridgewater made his NFL debut on September 21, 2014, against the New Orleans Saints, entering in relief of the injured Cassel and finished the game with 150 passing yards.[39] Bridgewater was named the starting quarterback for the remainder of the season after Cassel, who broke his foot in the aforementioned game, was placed on injured reserve.[40] On September 28, 2014, Bridgewater made his first NFL start against the Atlanta Falcons and won the game, in large part due to his 317 passing yards, and scored his first NFL touchdown on a 13-yard rush.[41] After spraining his ankle during the Falcons matchup, Bridgewater was inactive for the next game against the Green Bay Packers in Week 5. However, he was able to recover in time for the Week 6 game against the Detroit Lions. However, a weak offensive line against a strong Lions' defense led to a 17–3 rout. Bridgewater was intercepted three times, two from tipped passes, and was sacked eight times.[42] During Week 7 against the Buffalo Bills, Bridgewater threw his first NFL touchdown pass to Cordarrelle Patterson. Despite being sacked five times and throwing two interceptions, Bridgewater helped the Vikings get a 16–10 lead, but the effort was negated only by the Bills' comeback win which put them up 17–16 with no time to retaliate.[43] In the next game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Bridgewater threw for 241 yards and a touchdown and was sacked only once. He led a game-tying drive to force overtime, where fellow first-round pick Anthony Barr made a fumble recovery on the Bucs' first overtime play, giving the Vikings a 19–13 win.[44] His third win as a starter, a 29–26 comeback win over the Washington Redskins, broke a franchise record shared by Fran Tarkenton and Ponder for wins among starting rookie quarterbacks.[45] Bridgewater added to this record with wins over the Carolina Panthers, New York Jets, and Chicago Bears in weeks 13, 14, and 17 respectively.[46][47][48] The win over the Jets is notable for when wide receiver Jarius Wright turned a screen pass from Bridgewater into an 87-yard touchdown, giving the Vikings another overtime win. Bridgewater finished his rookie year with 2,919 passing yards, 14 touchdowns, 12 interceptions, and an 85.2 passer rating. He also rushed for 209 yards and a touchdown.[49] He played in 13 games, starting 12 of them. On January 13, 2015, Bridgewater was selected as the quarterback of the 2014 NFL All-Rookie team by the Pro Football Writers of America, joining Tommy Kramer as the only Vikings quarterbacks to claim this award.[50] Bridgewater also won the 2014 Pepsi Rookie of the Year award, as voted by fans.[51] Bridgewater threw for no touchdowns and an interception behind a struggling offensive line that allowed five sacks in the 3–20 loss at the San Francisco 49ers in Week 1.[52] He threw only 18 times the next game, but completed 14 of those passes for 153 yards and threw his first touchdown pass of the year to tight end Kyle Rudolph in a 26–16 win over the Lions in Minnesota's home opener.[53] Bridgewater had some struggles in week three against the San Diego Chargers, going 13 of 24 for 121 yards and one interception but won the game 31–14 with a strong performance by the defense and running back Adrian Peterson.[54] He rebounded to go 27 of 41, 269 yards and a touchdown pass to Mike Wallace against Denver Broncos who had the number one ranked defense coming into the game. Minnesota still lost 23–20 as Bridgewater was sacked seven times.[55] Coming off of a bye week, he threw 31 times and completed 17 of them for 249 yards with another touchdown pass to Rudolph, but threw two interceptions in a sloppy 16–10 win against the Kansas City Chiefs.[56] Bridgewater then had arguably the best game of his career the next week against the Lions going 25 of 35, 316 yards, two touchdown passes and no interceptions, including his first touchdown pass to rookie Stefon Diggs.[57] That game was Bridgewater's fourth career 300+ yard passing game, and the second 300+ passing game of Bridgewater's career against the Lions. Bridgewater led his fourth career fourth-quarter comeback at the Bears despite having a below-average day going 17 of 30, 187 yards, one touchdown and one interception.[58] Bridgewater went 13 of 21 for 144 yards and an interception while also rushing for a touchdown and two-point conversion against the St. Louis Rams before he sustained a blow to the head by the Rams' safety Lamarcus Joyner that caused Bridgewater to leave the game in the fourth quarter. Minnesota still managed to pull off a 21–18 victory in overtime against the Rams.[59] At home against the Bears in week 15, Bridgewater completed 17 of 20 pass attempts, four passing touchdowns, and a rushing touchdown in a 38–17 win, giving him a career-high passer rating (154.4).[60][61] In a fight for the NFC North Division Title in week 17 against the Packers, Bridgewater connected only 52.6% of his passes for 99 yards and an interception. Despite his career-lowest passer rating (45.7), the Vikings pulled off a 20–13 victory and won their first division title since 2009.[62][63] Bridgewater finished his second season with 3,231 passing yards, 14 touchdowns, and 9 interceptions. He also rushed for 192 yards and 3 touchdowns. During the wild-card round against the Seahawks in one of the coldest games ever played, Bridgewater was 17-of-24 for 146 yards as the Vikings fell 10–9 after Blair Walsh missed a 27-yard field goal.[64] On January 25, 2016, Bridgewater was named to his first Pro Bowl.[65] During a team practice on August 30, 2016, Bridgewater suffered a non-contact injury to his left leg. An ambulance took Bridgewater off the field and the rest of practice was canceled.[66] A subsequent MRI confirmed that Bridgewater tore his ACL and suffered other structural damage, including a dislocation of the knee joint. The injury was so severe that Bridgewater was at risk of losing his leg, with the surgeon describing it as a \"horribly grotesque injury... It's almost like a war wound. Everything is blown.\"[67] As a result, Bridgewater missed the rest of the 2016 season.[68][69] After the loss of Bridgewater for at least the 2016 season, the Vikings traded a first-round pick in the 2017 NFL draft and a conditional fourth-round pick in the 2018 NFL draft to the Philadelphia Eagles for quarterback Sam Bradford.[70] In 2016, the Vikings went 8–8, finishing third in the NFC North and missing the playoffs, despite starting the season with a 5–0 record.[71] The media initially reported that Bridgewater's injury would keep him out for 17–19 months, meaning he would miss the entire 2017 season. In January 2017, doctors confirmed that the healing would indeed take 19 months.[72] On May 1, 2017, the Vikings declined the fifth-year option on Bridgewater's contract, making him a free agent after the 2017 season.[73] Bridgewater began throwing and doing individual work in May at Vikings mini-camps. Head coach Mike Zimmer said on June 6, that Bridgewater \"has a long way to go\" until he is fully healed, but was impressed by his rehabilitation progress to that point.[74] However, on September 2, the Vikings announced that Bridgewater would begin the season on the PUP list, meaning that he would miss the first six games to begin the year.[75] On October 16, Bridgewater was cleared to practice, but could not return to action for three more weeks.[76][77] He was activated off PUP to the active roster on November 8 to be Case Keenum's backup.[78][79] Bridgewater entered the Week 15 game against the Cincinnati Bengals in relief of Keenum in the fourth quarter. The crowd gave Bridgewater a standing ovation as he walked onto the field.[80] Bridgewater finished with an interception out of two pass attempts as the Vikings won 34–7.[81][82] On March 18, 2018, Bridgewater signed a one-year contract with the Jets.[83][84] The contract only guaranteed a $500,000 signing bonus, though he could make up to a maximum of $15 million from a non-guaranteed salary and incentives.[85] On August 29, 2018, the Jets traded Bridgewater and a 2019 sixth-round draft pick to the Saints for a 2019 third-round draft pick.[86][87] Bridgewater made his Saints debut on October 8 against the Redskins, taking a knee twice to close out the game. He did this in two more games later in the season.[88] On December 28, with the Saints already having locked up the #1 seed, the team announced that Bridgewater would start in the season finale against the Panthers.[89] Making his first start since 2015, Bridgewater finished the game completing 14 of 22 passes for 118 yards, a touchdown, and an interception as the Saints lost 33–14. He also rushed for 12 yards.[90] On March 15, 2019, Bridgewater signed a one-year, $7.25 million fully guaranteed contract with the Saints.[91] During Week 2, he replaced Drew Brees, who left with a right thumb injury, completing 17 of 30 passes for 165 yards in a 27–9 loss to the Los Angeles Rams.[92] Due to Brees's injury, Bridgewater was named the starting quarterback for Week 3. In that game, Bridgewater completed 19 of 27 passes for 177 yards and two touchdowns as the Saints defeated the Seahawks on the road by a score of 33–27. This was the first game where Bridgewater threw for more than one touchdown in a game since week 15 of the 2015 season. In Week 5 against the Buccaneers, Bridgewater threw for 314 yards, four touchdowns, and one interception in the 31–24 win.[93] In Week 6, against the Jacksonville Jaguars, he had 240 passing yards and one passing touchdown in the 13–6 victory.[94] In Week 7, against the Bears, he had 281 passing yards and two passing touchdowns.[95] Brees returned from his injury in Week 8 against the Arizona Cardinals.[96] On March 26, 2020, Bridgewater signed a three-year, $63 million contract with the Panthers.[97] Bridgewater made his Panthers debut in the season-opening 34–30 loss to the Las Vegas Raiders and finished the game with 269 passing yards, including a 75-yard touchdown to former Jets teammate Robby Anderson.[98] During Week 2 against the Buccaneers, Bridgewater finished with 367 passing yards and two interceptions as the Panthers lost, 31–17.[99] In Week 3 against the Los Angeles Chargers, Bridgewater threw for 235 yards and one touchdown during the 21–16 win. This was Bridgewater's first win as a Panther.[100] In Week 5 against the Falcons, Bridgewater threw for 313 yards and two touchdowns during the 23–16 win.[101] In Week 9 against the Chiefs, Bridgewater threw for 310 yards and two touchdowns and rushed for 19 yards and another touchdown during the 33–31 loss.[102] Bridgewater finished the season with career-high totals in several statistics, including completions (340), passing yards (3,733), touchdowns (15) and rushing yards (279).[103] On April 28, 2021, weeks after the Panthers acquired Sam Darnold in a trade with the Jets, Bridgewater was traded to the Broncos in exchange for a 2021 sixth-round pick.[104] The team brought in Bridgewater to compete with incumbent quarterback Drew Lock, and the players split starts throughout the 2021 preseason.[105] On August 25, 2021, the Broncos announced that Bridgewater had won the starting job.[106] On September 12, Bridgewater made his Broncos debut on the road against the New York Giants, completing 28-of-36 passes for 264 yards and two touchdowns in a 27–13 season-opening victory.[107] He then led the team to 2–0 with a victory over the Jaguars in Week 2 with a 328-yard, two-touchdown day.[108] Bridgewater suffered a concussion in the Broncos Week 15 loss to the Bengals ruling him out for the rest of the season.[109] Bridgewater was placed on injured reserve on January 5, 2022.[110] He finished the 2021 season with 3,052 passing yards, 18 passing touchdowns, and seven interceptions to go along with two rushing touchdowns.[111] On March 17, 2022, Bridgewater signed a one-year contract with the Miami Dolphins worth up to $10 million.[112] Bridgewater made his first appearance for the Dolphins in Week 3 against the Bills after starter Tua Tagovailoa briefly left the game in the second quarter. He attempted two passes and was sacked once before Tagovailoa returned in the second half.[113] In Week 4 against the Bengals, Bridgewater came in the second quarter after Tagovailoa left the game with a head and neck injury. Bridgewater threw for 193 yards, a touchdown, and an interception in the 27–15 loss.[114][115] During Week 5 against the Jets, Bridgewater committed an intentional grounding penalty that occurred in the endzone for a safety. During the play, he was hit by Sauce Gardner and left the game due to a concussion.[116] In Week 6, against the Vikings, Bridgewater came into the game in relief of Skylar Thompson and passed for 329 yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions in the 24–16 loss.[117] Following Tua Tagovailoa entering concussion protocols after their Week 16 loss against the Packers, head coach Mike McDaniel announced that Bridgewater would start against the New England Patriots in Week 17.[118] In the game, Bridgewater completed 12-of-19 passes for 161 yards, a touchdown, and an interception that was returned for a touchdown before exiting the game in the third quarter after suffering a broken finger in his throwing hand. The Dolphins went on to lose 23–21.[119] As a result of the injury, third-string rookie quarterback Skylar Thompson made his second start of the season in Week 18 against the Jets.[120] On August 10, 2023, Bridgewater signed with the Lions, a move which reunited him with Dan Campbell, the assistant head coach during his time with the Saints.[121] On December 16, 2023, Bridgewater announced his plans to retire from the NFL following the conclusion of the season, and become a high school football coach.[122] Bridgewater officially announced his retirement for the first time on February 2, 2024.[123] On December 26, 2024, Bridgewater announced on NFL Network that he intended to continue his playing career in the NFL, and that he would be re-signed by the Lions, joining Hendon Hooker in backing up starting quarterback Jared Goff.[124] After the Lions' 2023 season ended with a loss to the 49ers in the NFC Championship game, Bridgewater formally confirmed his retirement from playing, and was shortly named the head coach for Miami Northwestern High School, his alma mater.[125] In his first season, Bridgewater and Miami Northwestern won the Class 3A Florida High School Athletic Association state title.[126] Bridgewater grew up in Miami as the youngest of four children to a single mother. He is a Christian.[127][128] He graduated from the University of Louisville with a degree in Sports Administration after the 2013 college football season.[129] His mother, Rose, is a breast cancer survivor. In 2014, soon after her son was drafted by the Vikings, Cadillac presented a pink Escalade to Rose when they learned that Bridgewater had wanted to get her one ever since he was in the third grade.[130]",

                "title": "Lions signing Teddy Bridgewater: Veteran QB coming out of retirement to rejoin Detroit for postseason run - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Teddy Bridgewater is making his return to the NFL. The quarterback is coming out of retirement to join the Detroit Lions, head coach Dan Campbell confirmed on Thursday. The 32-year-old teased a return earlier this month, not long after leading his alma mater Miami Northwestern to a state title in his first year as a high school football coach and Campbell confirmed that the two have been in contact for a while. The Lions were the last squad he suited up, playing for them in 2023, and he joins them again as they look to make a playoff run. Campbell had nothing but positive things to say about his returning QB. Coach Campbell on Teddy Bridgewater pic.twitter.com/UEDA77T35q \"To be able to add somebody back here that's got experience, he's stayed in shape, he's been throwing … it just brings a level of professionalism, veteran presence. Somebody that's great for our team, great for the position,\" he said. \"... This gives us somebody that's played a lot in the NFL.\" Jared Goff is Detroit's starter and the quarterback room also includes second-year player Hendon Hooker. Former fifth-rounder Jake Fromm is the Lions' practice squad QB. Campbell emphasized that this \"doesn't mean we're disappointed in Hooker\" and \"does not mean that Hooker is out.\" With the playoffs fast approaching, Campbell felt this was a great opportunity to get someone familiar with the team who has that veteran presence and experience. Bridgewater \"brings a certain level of comfort\" to the coaches and they have that trust in him, given their previous relationship. Campbell says he understands what it looks like, with people questioning what this means for Hooker, but said the playoffs are a \"different world\" and they want to have the depth to be ready for whatever happens. The Lions have dealt with extensive injuries this year, with 21 players on injured reserve, so it's not surprising that preparing for players potentially being sidelined is on the front of their mind. Campbell has also seen what can happen with quarterbacks in the playoffs, with teams being left thin at the position. He says this \"absolutely\" gives them a solid option for the emergency third quarterback and lessens their concerns there. \"If something happens you've got your third ready to roll,\" he said. Aside from what he brings to the field, Campbell also said Bridgewater brings a lot as a leader. \"It's great for our team. I think everybody in that locker room respects Teddy and what he stands for, the type of human being he is, but also the type of player,\" Campbell said. \"... When you get guys that you feel like make everybody around them a little bit better, it's hard not to have those guys around, or add them if you can.\" Bridgewater appeared in just one game for the Lions last season, but did not record a pass attempt. Bridgewater, a 2014 first-round pick of the Vikings out of Louisville, also played for the Saints, Panthers, Broncos and Dolphins. On Dec. 17, Bridgewater made the surprise announcement that he was actively pursuing a return to the league. \"We'll see how these next week-and-a-half, two weeks play out. Might be signing with a team or something and then returning back to coach high school football in February. So we'll see.\" Just over a week later, his plans are revealed. When he first discussed coming out of retirement, he did note that it doesn't mean he is done coaching. \"We wanted to win a state championship and then coach goes back to the league, see what happens and then come back in February in the offseason and continue coaching high school football. So we'll see how it plays out,\" Bridgewater said. Bridgewater's last starting gig came in 2022 as a member of the Dolphins, where he went 0-2 with 683 yards, four touchdowns and four interceptions on the year. In his career, Bridgewater has a 33-32 starting record, while throwing for 15,120 yards, 75 touchdowns and 47 interceptions. The Lions have the second-best odds of winning it all, per Caesars Sportsbook, so Bridgewater has a chance to win a Super Bowl ring and a high school championship within the same year. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

                "content": "NEW! Find where to watch all of your favorite sports! Dan Campbell confirms that quarterback Teddy Bridgewater is unretiring and signing with the Lions. (1:00) Quarterback Teddy Bridgewater has come out of retirement and signed with the Detroit Lions on Thursday, weeks after he coached his high school alma mater to a state championship. Lions coach Dan Campbell said Bridgewater's return does not mean the team is disappointed with current backup quarterback Hendon Hooker. Bridgewater said last week that he wanted to return to the NFL after coaching Miami Northwestern Senior High School, his alma mater, to the Class 3A Florida High School Athletic Association state title earlier this month. \"My team knows that's the plan. We wanted to win a state championship and then Coach goes back to the league, see what happens, and then come back February in the offseason, continue coaching high school football. We'll see how it plays out,\" he told NFL Network's \"The Insiders\" last week. A source told ESPN's Jeremy Fowler on Thursday that Bridgewater has received NFL coaching inquiries in recent weeks but that he wants to try to win a championship as a player before entertaining those opportunities. Bridgewater, 32, spent last season as the Lions' backup quarterback behind starter Jared Goff. Campbell said that he has been in contact with Bridgewater \"for a while\" and that re-signing him was always a possibility because of Bridgewater's leadership and familiarity with the system. The Lions organization has a tremendous amount of trust in Bridgewater and has followed him throughout his high school coaching journey this year. \"It just brings a level of professionalism, veteran presence, somebody that's great for our team, he's great for the position,\" Campbell said. \"Doesn't mean we're disappointed in Hooker. That's not what this means. It just means this gives us somebody that's played a lot in the NFL. We're getting ready for the playoffs, and so it'll be good to get him back in the fold with us.\" The Lions have continued to develop Hooker, who has \"improved,\" according to Campbell. Hooker has learned under Goff after becoming the Lions' highest-drafted quarterback since Matthew Stafford went No. 1 in 2009. Hooker was selected as the 68th overall pick in the third round of the 2023 NFL draft. However, Campbell said he feels that the addition of Bridgewater is \"great\" for the team, not only on the field, but in practices, as well, with his friendly demeanor and many years of experience that fit well with players. \"This does not mean that Hooker is out. That's not what this means. If it comes to that, Hooker's going to play for us, but Teddy probably will, too,\" Campbell said. \"So, I understand what it looks like, but it's just a different world that we're getting ready to walk into, and we felt like this was the right thing to do.\" Goff said \"it's cool\" to have Bridgewater back on the team. \"I'm glad I have him back here, state champ Teddy Bridgewater is what we call him now, but yeah, he's a valuable asset to our team and I love having him in the quarterback room and he's great to have around,\" Goff said. After retiring, Bridgewater was hired by Miami Northwestern in February, tasked with turning around a program that went 4-6 the previous season. Miami Northwestern went 12-2 this season, outscoring its opponents 262-12 in five playoff games. It finished the season on a 10-game winning streak. A first-round pick by the Minnesota Vikings in 2014, Bridgewater has had a career that was nearly derailed because of a torn ACL and a dislocated knee sustained during training camp in 2016; he missed all of that season and most of 2017 before leaving the Vikings. He spent two seasons with the New Orleans Saints (2018-19), started 29 games over two seasons for the Carolina Panthers (2020) and Denver Broncos (2021), and served as Tua Tagovailoa's backup with the Miami Dolphins in 2022, when he was limited by injuries again. He then signed with the Lions for his last season and appeared in one game to kneel out a victory. ESPN's Eric Woodyard contributed to this report.",

                "title": "Detroit Lions bring back QB Teddy Bridgewater",
                "content": "Senior Writer The Detroit Lions have brought back a familiar face. The team signed veteran quarterback Teddy Bridgewater to the active roster and he was on the practice field Thursday as the Lions begin on-field preparations for Monday night's game on the road against the San Francisco 49ers. Bridgewater spent last season as Jared Goff's backup in Detroit but retired after the season to coach his high school alma mater, Miami Northwestern. After leading Northwestern to a state title earlier this month, Bridgewater told NFL Network Insiders Ian Rapoport and Tom Pelissero he planned to return to the NFL. Bridgewater, 32, knows the offense and is a good fit in Detroit. \"I've been in contact with Teddy for a while. It was something that was always potentially a possibility,\" Lions head coach Dan Campbell said Thursday. \"We all know what Teddy's been doing down there and giving back to his community. They won a championship down there, so his debut at coaching worked out pretty dang good. \"But to be able to get somebody back here that's got experience – he's staying in shape, he's been throwing, just get him worked back in here a little bit. It just brings a level of professionalism, veteran presence, somebody that's great for our team, great for the position.\" Bridgewater has career stops with the Minnesota Vikings, New Orleans Saints, Carolina Panthers, Denver Broncos and Miami Dolphins. He's played in 79 games with 65 starts and has a 33-32 record, throwing for 15,120 yards, 75 touchdowns and 47 interceptions. Campbell said the move to add Bridgewater was not a sign that they are disappointed or lacking trust in second-year quarterback Hendon Hooker. The 2023 third-round pick has served as Goff's backup all season and Campbell said he has gotten 'a little bit better' each week. \"Doesn't mean we're disappointed in Hooker, that's not what this means, it just means this gives us somebody that's played a lot in the NFL, we're getting ready for the playoffs,\" Campbell said. \"And so, it'll be good to get him back in the fold with us.\" \"I understand what it looks like, but it's just a different world that we're getting ready to walk into, and I just – we felt like this was the right thing to do, especially with somebody that I have a tremendous amount of trust with and for. He understands our offense well, the guys know him well, the coaches know him well, and he brings a certain level of comfort to us.\" CHEESEHEADS FOR A DAY Lions fans will become huge Green Bay Packers fans Sunday starting at around 4:25 p.m. The Packers face the Vikings in Minnesota, and a Packers win would give the Lions an opportunity to clinch the NFC North title and the No. 1 seed in the NFC with a win Monday night in San Francisco. A Vikings win will mean that no matter what happens in the Lions-49ers game Monday night, the Week 18 matchup between the Vikings and Lions in Detroit will be a winner take all for the division title (and the No. 1 seed for Detroit) with the loser falling to the No. 5 seed and starting the playoffs on the road.

Campbell said he felt pretty good about Reeves-Maybin making it back this week after the Lions started his practice clock last week. The veteran linebacker has been out since injuring his neck Week 9 in Houston. He was a Pro Bowl special teamer for the Lions last year and is a valuable reserve at linebacker, especially in passing situations. The Lions have been hit hard by injury at linebacker with Alex Anzalone, Derrick Barnes, and Malcolm Rodriguez currently on IR. EXTRA POINT The Lions began the practice clock of wide receiver/returner Kalif Raymond Thursday, though Campbell didn't seem optimistic he would be able to play Monday in San Francisco. \"I don't feel as confident with him as I do Germ (Reeves-Maybin), but it's good to have him back out practicing,\" Campbell said of the possibility Raymond returns this week against the 49ers. \"It will be good to get him back out there running around.\" Head coach Dan Campbell said third-year wide receiver Jameson Williams' performance against the Chicago Bears Sunday was probably his best as a Detroit Lion.

                "title": "Manmohan Singh - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Manmohan Singh (Punjabi: [mənˈmoːɦən ˈsɪ́ŋɡ] ⓘ; 26 September 1932 – 26 December 2024) was an Indian politician, economist, academic, and bureaucrat, who served as the 13th prime minister of India from 2004 to 2014. He was the fourth longest-serving prime minister after Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Narendra Modi.[1] A member of the Indian National Congress, Singh was the first Sikh prime minister of India.[2] He was also the first prime minister since Nehru to be re-elected after completing a full five-year term.[3][4] Born in Gah in what is today Pakistan, Singh's family migrated to India during its partition in 1947. After obtaining his doctorate in economics from the University of Oxford, Singh worked for the United Nations during 1966–1969. He subsequently began his bureaucratic career when Lalit Narayan Mishra hired him as an advisor in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. During the 1970s and 1980s, Singh held several key posts in the Government of India, such as Chief Economic Advisor (1972–1976), governor of the Reserve Bank (1982–1985) and head of the Planning Commission (1985–1987). In 1991, as India faced a severe economic crisis, the newly elected prime minister, P. V. Narasimha Rao, inducted the apolitical Singh into his cabinet as finance minister. Over the next few years, despite strong opposition, he carried out several structural reforms that liberalised India's economy. Although these measures proved successful in averting the crisis, and enhanced Singh's reputation globally as a leading reform-minded economist, the incumbent Congress Party fared poorly in the 1996 general election. Subsequently, Singh was leader of the opposition in the Rajya Sabha (the upper house of the Parliament of India) during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government of 1998–2004. In 2004, when the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance came to power, its chairperson Sonia Gandhi unexpectedly relinquished the prime ministership to Singh. His first ministry executed several key legislations and projects, including the National Rural Health Mission, Unique Identification Authority, Rural Employment Guarantee scheme and Right to Information Act. In 2008, opposition to a historic civil nuclear agreement with the United States nearly caused Singh's government to fall after Left Front parties withdrew their support.[5] In 2009, he co-founded BRICS.[6] India's economy grew rapidly during his term.[7][8] The 2009 general election saw the UPA return with an increased mandate, with Singh retaining the office of prime minister. After his term ended, he opted out from the race for the office of prime minister during the 2014 Indian general election.[9] Singh was never a member of the Lok Sabha but served as a member of the Rajya Sabha, representing the state of Assam from 1991 to 2019 and Rajasthan from 2019 to 2024.[10][11] Singh was born to Gurmukh Singh Kohli and Amrit Kaur on 26 September 1932, in Gah, Punjab, British India (now in Punjab, Pakistan), into a family of Punjabi Sikh traders of Khatri background.[12][13] His mother died when he was very young.[14][15] His paternal grandmother Jamna Devi raised him, and he was very close to her.[12][15] His early schooling was in Urdu medium until the age of 10, after which he was enrolled in an upper-primary school in Peshawar.[12][16] Even as prime minister years later, Singh wrote his apparently Hindi speeches in the Urdu script, although sometimes he would also use Gurmukhi, a script used to write Punjabi, his mother tongue.[17] After the Partition of India, his family migrated to Haldwani, India.[14] In 1948 they relocated to Amritsar, where he studied at Hindu College, Amritsar.[14][18] He attended Panjab University, then in Hoshiarpur,[19][20][21] Punjab, studying Economics and got his bachelor's and master's degrees in 1952 and 1954, respectively, standing first throughout his academic career. He completed his Economics Tripos at University of Cambridge in 1957. He was a member of St John's College.[22] In a 2005 interview with the British journalist Mark Tully, Singh said about his Cambridge days: I first became conscious of the creative role of politics in shaping human affairs, and I owe that mostly to my teachers Joan Robinson and Nicholas Kaldor. Joan Robinson was a brilliant teacher, but she also sought to awaken the inner conscience of her students in a manner that very few others were able to achieve. She questioned me a great deal and made me think the unthinkable. She propounded the left wing interpretation of Keynes, maintaining that the state has to play more of a role if you really want to combine development with social equity. Kaldor influenced me even more; I found him pragmatic, scintillating, stimulating. Joan Robinson was a great admirer of what was going on in China, but Kaldor used the Keynesian analysis to demonstrate that capitalism could be made to work.[23] After Cambridge, Singh returned to India and served as a teacher at Panjab University.[24] In 1960, he went to the University of Oxford for his DPhil, where he was a member of Nuffield College. His 1962 doctoral thesis under the supervision of Ian Little was titled \"India's export performance, 1951–1960, export prospects and policy implications\", and was later the basis for his book \"India's Export Trends and Prospects for Self-Sustained Growth\".[25] Premiership Budgets After completing his D.Phil., Singh returned to India. He was a senior lecturer of economics at Panjab University from 1957 to 1959. During 1959 and 1963, he served as a reader in economics at Panjab University, and from 1963 to 1965, he was an economics professor there.[26] Then he went to work for the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) from 1966 to 1969.[22] Later, he was appointed as an advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Trade by Lalit Narayan Mishra, in recognition of Singh's talent as an economist.[27] From 1969 to 1971, Singh was a professor of international trade at the Delhi School of Economics, University of Delhi.[22][28] In 1972, Singh was chief economic adviser in the Ministry of Finance, and in 1976 he was secretary in the Finance Ministry.[22] In 1980–1982 he was at the Planning Commission, and in 1982, he was appointed governor of the Reserve Bank of India under then finance minister Pranab Mukherjee and held the post until 1985.[22] He went on to become the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission (India) from 1985 to 1987.[13] Following his tenure at the Planning Commission, he was secretary general of the South Commission, an independent economic policy think tank headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland from 1987 to November 1990.[29] Singh returned to India from Geneva in November 1990 and held the post as the advisor to Prime Minister of India on economic affairs during the tenure of Chandra Shekar.[22] In March 1991, he became chairman of the University Grants Commission.[22] In June 1991, India's prime minister at the time, P. V. Narasimha Rao, chose Singh to be his finance minister. Singh told Mark Tully, a British journalist, in 2005: On the day (Rao) was formulating his cabinet, he sent his Principal Secretary to me saying, \"The PM would like you to become the Minister of Finance\". I didn't take it seriously. He eventually tracked me down the next morning, rather angry, and demanded that I get dressed up and come to Rashtrapati Bhavan for the swearing in. So that's how I started in politics[.][24] In 1991, India's fiscal deficit was close to 8.5 per cent of the gross domestic product, the balance of payments deficit was huge and the current account deficit was close to 3.5 per cent of India's GDP.[30] India's foreign reserves barely amounted to US$1 billion, enough to pay for 2 weeks of imports,[31] in comparison to US$600 billion in 2009.[32] Singh explained to the PM and the party that India is facing an unprecedented crisis.[31] However the rank and file of the party resisted deregulation.[31] So P. Chidambaram and Singh explained to the party that the economy would collapse if it was not deregulated.[31] To the dismay of the party, Rao allowed Singh to deregulate the Indian economy.[31] Subsequently, Singh, who had thus far been one of the most influential architects of India's socialist economy, eliminated the permit raj,[31] reduced state control of the economy, and reduced import taxes[30][33] Rao and Singh thus implemented policies to open up the economy and change India's socialist economy to a more capitalistic one, in the process dismantling the License Raj, a system that inhibited the prosperity of private businesses. They removed many obstacles standing in the way of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and initiated the process of the privatisation of public sector companies. However, in spite of these reforms, Rao's government was voted out in 1996 due to non-performance of government in other areas. In praise of Singh's work that pushed India towards a market economy, long-time Cabinet minister P. Chidambaram has compared Singh's role in India's reforms to Deng Xiaoping's in China.[34] In 1993, Singh offered his resignation from the post of Finance Minister after a parliamentary investigation report criticised his ministry for not being able to anticipate a US$1.8 billion 1992 securities scandal. Prime Minister Rao refused Singh's resignation, instead promising to punish the individuals directly accused in the report.[35] Singh was first elected to the upper house of Parliament, the Rajya Sabha, in 1991[36] by the legislature of the state of Assam, and was re-elected in 1995, 2001, 2007[13] and 2013.[37] From 1998 to 2004, while the Bharatiya Janata Party was in power, Singh was the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha. In 1999, he contested for the Lok Sabha from South Delhi but was unable to win the seat.[38] After the 2004 general elections, the Indian National Congress ended the incumbent National Democratic Alliance (NDA) tenure by becoming the political party with the single largest number of seats in the Lok Sabha. It formed United Progressive Alliance (UPA) with allies and staked claim to form government. In a surprise move, Chairperson Sonia Gandhi declared Manmohan Singh, a technocrat, as the UPA candidate for the prime ministership. Despite the fact that Singh had never won a direct popular election, according to the BBC, he \"enjoyed massive popular support, not least because he was seen by many as a clean politician untouched by the taint of corruption that has run through many Indian administrations.\"[39] He took the oath as the Prime Minister of India on 22 May 2004.[40][41] In 1991, Singh, as Finance Minister, abolished the Licence Raj, source of slow economic growth and corruption in the Indian economy for decades. He liberalised the Indian economy, allowing it to speed up development dramatically. During his term as prime minister, Singh continued to encourage growth in the Indian market, enjoying widespread success in these matters. Singh, along with his finance minister, P. Chidambaram, presided over a period where the Indian economy grew with an 8–9% economic growth rate. In 2007, India achieved its highest GDP growth rate of 9% and became the second fastest growing major economy in the world.[42][43] Singh's ministry enacted a National Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) in 2005.[44] Singh's government continued the Golden Quadrilateral and the highway modernisation program that was initiated by Vajpayee's government.[45] Singh also worked on reforming the banking and financial sectors, as well as public sector companies.[46] The Finance ministry worked towards relieving farmers of their debt and worked towards pro-industry policies.[47] In 2005, Singh's government introduced the value added tax, replacing sales tax. In 2007 and early 2008, the global problem of inflation impacted India.[48] In 2005, Prime Minister Singh and his government's health ministry started the National Rural Health Mission (NHRM), which mobilised half a million community health workers. This rural health initiative was praised by the American economist Jeffrey Sachs.[49] In 2006, his Government implemented the proposal to reserve 27% of seats in All India Institute of Medical Studies (AIIMS), Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) and other central institutions of higher education for Other Backward Classes which led to 2006 Indian anti-reservation protests.[50][51][52] On 2 July 2009, Singh ministry introduced the Right to Education Act (RTE) act. Eight IITs were opened in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Orissa, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh.[53] The Singh government also continued the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan program. The program includes the introduction and improvement of mid-day meals and the opening of schools all over India, especially in rural areas, to fight illiteracy.[54] Singh's government strengthened anti-terror laws with amendments to Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). National Investigation Agency (NIA) was also created soon after the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, as need for a central agency to combat terrorism was realised.[55] Also, Unique Identification Authority of India was established in February 2009, an agency responsible for implementing the envisioned Multipurpose National Identity Card with the objective of increasing national security and facilitating e-governance.[56] Singh's administration initiated a massive reconstruction effort in Kashmir to stabilise the region but after some period of success, insurgent infiltration and terrorism in Kashmir has increased since 2009.[57] The Singh administration was, however, successful in reducing terrorism in Northeast India.[57] The important National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) and the Right to Information Act were passed by the Parliament in 2005 during his tenure. While the effectiveness of the NREGA has been successful at various degrees, in various regions, the RTI act has proved crucial in India's fight against corruption.[58] New cash benefits were also introduced for widows, pregnant women, and landless persons.[59][60] The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 was passed on 29 August 2013 in the Lok Sabha (lower house of the Indian parliament) and on 4 September 2013 in Rajya Sabha (upper house of the Indian parliament). The bill received the assent of the President of India, Pranab Mukherjee on 27 September 2013.[61] The Act came into force from 1 January 2014.[62][63][64] Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act was enacted on 4 August 2009, which describes the modalities of the importance of free and compulsory education for children between 6 and 14 in India under Article 21A of the Indian Constitution.[65] India became one of 135 countries to make education a fundamental right of every child when the act came into force on 1 April 2010.[66][67][68] Manmohan Singh continued the pragmatic foreign policy that was started by P.V. Narasimha Rao and continued by Bharatiya Janata Party's Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Singh continued the peace process with Pakistan initiated by his predecessor, Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Exchange of high-level visits by top leaders from both countries have highlighted his tenure. Efforts have been made during Singh's tenure to end the border dispute with People's Republic of China. In November 2006, Chinese President Hu Jintao visited India which was followed by Singh's visit to Beijing in January 2008. A major development in Sino-Indian relations was the reopening of the Nathula Pass in 2006 after being closed for more than four decades.[69] Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Li Keqiang paid a state visit to India (Delhi-Mumbai) from 19 to 21 May 2013.[69] Singh paid an official visit to China from 22 to 24 October 2013.[69] Three agreements were signed establishing sister-city partnership between Delhi-Beijing, Kolkata-Kunming and Bangalore-Chengdu. As of 2010, the People's Republic of China was the second biggest trade partner of India.[70] Relations with Afghanistan have improved considerably, with India now becoming the largest regional donor to Afghanistan.[71] During Afghan President Hamid Karzai's visit to New Delhi in August 2008, Manmohan Singh increased the aid package to Afghanistan for the development of more schools, health clinics, infrastructure, and defence.[72] Under the leadership of Singh, India emerged as one of the single largest aid donors to Afghanistan.[72] Singh's government worked towards stronger ties with the United States. He visited the United States in July 2005 initiating negotiations over the Indo-US civilian nuclear agreement. This was followed by George W. Bush's successful visit to India in March 2006, during which the declaration over the nuclear agreement was made, giving India access to American nuclear fuel and technology while India will have to allow IAEA inspection of its civil nuclear reactors. After more than two years for more negotiations, followed by approval from the IAEA, Nuclear Suppliers Group and the US Congress, India and the US signed the agreement on 10 October 2008 with Pranab Mukherjee representing India.[73] Singh had the first official state visit to the White House during the administration of US President Barack Obama. The visit took place in November 2009, and several discussions took place, including on trade and nuclear power.[74] Relations have improved with Japan and European Union countries, like the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. Relations with Iran have continued and negotiations over the Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline have taken place. New Delhi hosted an India–Africa Summit in April 2006 which was attended by the leaders of 15 African states.[75] Relations have improved with other developing countries, particularly Brazil and South Africa. Singh carried forward the momentum which was established after the \"Brasilia Declaration\" in 2003 and the IBSA Dialogue Forum was formed.[76] Singh's government has also been especially keen on expanding ties with Israel. Since 2003, the two countries have made significant investments in each other[77] and Israel now rivals Russia to become India's largest defence partner.[78] Though there have been a few diplomatic glitches between India and Russia, especially over the delay and price hike of several Russian weapons to be delivered to India,[79] relations between the two remained strong with India and Russia signing various agreements to increase defence, nuclear energy and space co-operation.[80] During the Libyan Civil War, India abstained from voting on the UN Security Council's Resolutions 1970 and 1973 that authorised NATO action in Libya.[81] In Lok Sabha, resolution was uniamously adopted to condemn NATO's military intervention in Libya.[82] In 2009, Singh was among the leaders who laid the foundation of the BRICS. The establishment of the group is often described as a display of emergent economic power.[6] Manmohan Singh criticised the West for the use of force to enforce regime change in Syria and Libya during his speech at the UN in September 2011.[83] India was silent over the killing of Gaddafi.[84][85] Although India was among the last few countries to recognise the Libyan National Transitional Council, it agreed to work with the Council to help rebuild Libya.[86] India resent an ambassador to Tripoli in July 2012 having shut its mission in Tripoli in 2011.[87] India held general elections to the 15th Lok Sabha in five phases between 16 April 2009 and 13 May 2009. The results of the election were announced on 16 May 2009.[88] Strong showing in Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh helped the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) form the new government under the incumbent Singh, who became the first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru in 1962 to win re-election after completing a full five-year term.[89] The Congress and its allies were able to put together a comfortable majority with support from 322 members out of 543 members of the House. These included those of the UPA and the external support from the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Samajwadi Party (SP), Janata Dal (Secular) (JD(S)), Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and other minor parties.[90] On 22 May 2009, Manmohan Singh was sworn in as the prime minister during a ceremony held at Rashtrapati Bhavan.[91][92] The 2012 report filed by the CAG in Parliament of India states that due to the allocation of coal blocks to certain private companies without bidding process the nation suffered an estimated loss of Rs 1.85 trillion (short scale) between 2005 and 2009 in which Manmohan Singh was the coal minister of India.[93][94] Manmohan Singh declined to appear before a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) in April 2013 when called upon by one of the members of JPC Yashwant Sinha for his alleged involvement in the 2G case.[95] Singh's premiership officially ended at noon on 17 May 2014. He did not contest the 2014 general election for the 16th Lok Sabha as the prime ministerial candidate. He resigned his post as prime minister after the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance won the election. He served as the acting prime minister till 26 May 2014, when Narendra Modi was sworn in as the new prime minister.[96][97] Singh, along with Congress president Sonia Gandhi, former Presidents A. P. J. Abdul Kalam and Pratibha Patil, and Vice-President Hamid Ansari attended Modi's swearing-in ceremony.[98] In 2016, it was announced that Singh was to take up a position at Panjab University as the Jawaharlal Nehru Chair, which he eventually did not.[99] Singh retired from the Rajya Sabha in April 2024 and was succeeded by Sonia Gandhi.[100] The Independent described Singh as \"one of the world's most revered leaders\" and \"a man of uncommon decency and grace\", noting that he drives a Maruti 800, one of the humblest cars in the Indian market. Khushwant Singh lauded Singh as the best prime minister India has had, even rating him higher than Jawaharlal Nehru. He mentions an incident in his book Absolute Khushwant: The Low-Down on Life, Death and Most things In-between where after losing the 1999 Lok Sabha elections, Singh immediately returned the ₹2 lakh (US$2,400) he had borrowed from the writer for hiring taxis. Terming him as the best example of integrity, Khushwant Singh stated, \"When people talk of integrity, I say the best example is the man who occupies the country's highest office.\"[101] In 2010, Newsweek magazine recognised him as a world leader who is respected by other heads of state, describing him as \"the leader other leaders love.\" The article quoted Mohamed ElBaradei, who remarked that Singh is \"the model of what a political leader should be.\"[102] Singh also received the World Statesman Award in 2010. Henry Kissinger described Singh as \"a statesman with vision, persistence and integrity\", and praised him for his \"leadership, which has been instrumental in the economic transformation underway in India.\"[103] Singh was ranked 18 on the 2010 Forbes list of the World's Most Powerful People.[104] Forbes magazine described Singh as being \"universally praised as India's best prime minister since Nehru\".[105] Australian journalist Greg Sheridan praised Singh \"as one of the greatest statesmen in Asian history.\"[106] Singh was later ranked 19 and 28 in 2012 and 2013 in the Forbes list.[107][108][109] Time magazine described Singh as \"guiding India into the ranks of the great powers\".[110] Conversely, Time magazine's Asia edition for 10–17 July 2012, on its cover remarked that Singh was an \"underachiever\".[111] It stated that Singh appears \"unwilling to stick his neck out\" on reforms that will put the country back onto a growth path. Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari rebutted the charges. UPA ally Lalu Prasad Yadav took issue with the magazine's statements. Praising the government, Prasad said UPA projects [were] doing well and asked, \"What will America say as their own economy is shattered?\".[112] Additionally, Singh faced negative reception following the 2008 Mumbai attacks for falling short on enhancing national security. [113] In his 2020 memoir A Promised Land, former U.S. President Barack Obama called Singh \"Wise, thoughtful, and scrupulously honest\".[114] Political opponents, including BJP co-founder L. K. Advani, have claimed that Singh is a \"weak\" prime minister. Advani declared \"He is weak. What do I call a person who can't take his decisions until 10 Janpath gives instruction.\"[115][116][117] Arvind Kejriwal in 2018 said the people are \"missing an educated PM like Dr Manmohan Singh\".[118] In 2022, Union Transport Minister of Modi Government, Nitin Gadkari said the \"country is indebted to Manmohan Singh for the liberalisation that gave a new direction\".[119] In 2013, BJP leader Narendra Modi had termed Singh as \"night watchman\" and a \"puppet of the Gandhi family\".[120] On 8 February 2024, Modi praised Manmohan Singh stating,[121] Ideological differences are short lived, but the way Manmohan Singh has guided this House and the country for such a long period, he will be remembered for his contributions during every discussion on our democracy. Modi also recalled when Singh arrived at the Parliament in a wheelchair to cast his vote over a key legislation.[121] Singh married Gursharan Kaur in 1958. They had three daughters, Upinder Singh, Daman Singh and Amrit Singh.[122] Upinder Singh is a professor of history at Ashoka University.[123] Daman Singh is a graduate of St. Stephen's College, Delhi and Institute of Rural Management, Anand, Gujarat, and author of The Last Frontier: People and Forests in Mizoram and a novel ,Nine by Nine,[124] Amrit Singh is a staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union.[125] Singh's son-in-law, Ashok Pattnaik, a 1983 batch Indian Police Service officer, was appointed CEO of National Intelligence Grid (NATGRID) in 2016.[126] Singh was attacked during the 1984 Anti-Sikh riots and provided financial assistance to the Citizens' Relief Committee, and had controversially apologised on behalf of the Indian National Congress for the bloodshed during the riots.[127][128] Until his death, Singh resided at 3 Motilal Nehru Marg in New Delhi.[129] Singh underwent multiple cardiac bypass surgeries, the last of which took place in January 2009.[130] In May 2020, Singh was hospitalised at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi due to a negative reaction from his medication.[131] In October 2021, Singh was hospitalised again at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences after experiencing weakness and a fever.[132] On 26 December 2024, Singh was admitted to the emergency department of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi for issues relating to heart disease and old age.[133][134] He had collapsed earlier at his home in New Delhi.[134][135] Singh died a few hours after his hospitalization at the age of 92.[136][137][138] Following his death, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called Singh one of \"India's most distinguished leaders\" and declared national mourning.[137] President Droupadi Murmu, Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar, Opposition Leader Rahul Gandhi, Home Affairs Minister Amit Shah, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and former Prime Minister H. D.

                "content": "Follow: India’s former prime minister Manmohan Singh, who steered the country through sweeping reforms and paved the way for its emergence as a global economic powerhouse, has died. He was 92. Singh was taken to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi for emergency treatment on Thursday after “sudden loss of consciousness at home,” the hospital said in a statement, adding that he had been undergoing care for age-related medical conditions. Despite emergency efforts, he was declared dead on Thursday night, the hospital said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India was mourning Singh’s passing, calling him one of the country’s “most distinguished leaders.” “As our Prime Minister, he made extensive efforts to improve people’s lives,” Modi wrote on X on Thursday. Known for wearing his trademark blue turban, Singh was India’s first prime minister from the Sikh minority. He led the country from 2004 to 2014, completing a rare two full terms in the world’s largest – and often tumultuous – democracy. An Oxford-trained economist, he was widely credited as the architect of far-reaching reforms that opened up India’s economy, propelling years of unprecedented growth and lifting tens of millions of people out of poverty. He also oversaw a new era of warming relations between India and the United States, marked by the signing of a historic nuclear-energy deal between the two countries in 2008. Washington offered its condolences following Singh’s death. In a statement, Secretary of State Antony Blinken called Singh “one of the greatest champions of the US-India strategic partnership.” “We mourn Dr. Singh’s passing and will always remember his dedication to bringing the United States and India closer together,” Blinken said. Growing up poor, Singh was widely respected for his personal integrity and humility. However, a series of corruption scandals against his ministers in his second term had tarnished his image – though he was never accused of being corrupt himself. The soft-spoken, mild-mannered technocrat didn’t set out to run for top office. Dubbed by some as a “reluctant king,” Singh was tapped to become prime minister by Congress Party leader Sonia Gandhi, who decided to turn down the role herself after leading her party to a shock election victory over the ruling Hindu nationalists in 2004. Born in Italy, Gandhi faced opposition from Hindu nationalists to lead the country over her foreign roots. And so, she turned to Singh, who was then known for his role in unleashing a bold wave of economic reforms as finance minister in the early 1990s. Though some critics say Gandhi, widow of an assassinated prime minister, had been the real source of power behind the scenes. Born in 1932 in a farming village without electricity in what was then British-ruled India and now part of Pakistan, Singh grew up in poverty with nine siblings. He studied hard and attended university in India, before heading to Britain to obtain a master’s degree from the University of Cambridge and a PhD in economics from Oxford. After graduation, he returned to India to teach economics at his alma mater. He joined the commerce ministry as an economic adviser in 1971, starting a decades-long career in government. Two decades later, Singh rose through the ranks to become the country’s finance minister when India was on the verge of economic collapse, with its foreign exchange reserves sufficient to cover only a few weeks of essential imports. He moved swiftly to unleash a barrage of ambitious measures to transform India’s inward-looking economy, privatizing bloated state-run companies and courting foreign investment. The reforms jump-started India’s economic growth, propelling it to the world’s fifth largest economy of today. Singh adopted a low profile after relinquishing the post of prime minister to his successor, Modi. Months before his death, Singh said at a press conference that he did the best he could as prime minister. “I honestly believe that history will be kinder to me than the contemporary media or, for that matter, the opposition parties in parliament,” he said, according to Reuters. Singh is survived by his wife and three daughters. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved. CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.",

                "content": "The Chengdu J-20 (Chinese: 歼-20; pinyin: Jiān-Èrlíng), also known as Mighty Dragon (Chinese: 威龙; pinyin: Wēilóng,[8][9][10] NATO reporting name: Fagin),[11] is a twin-engine all-weather stealth[12] fighter developed by China's Chengdu Aerospace Corporation for the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF).[5] The J-20 is designed as an air superiority fighter with precision strike capability.[13] The aircraft has three notable variants: the initial production model, the revised airframe variant with new engines and thrust-vectoring control, and the aircraft-teaming capable twin-seat variant. Descending from the J-XX program of the 1990s,[14] the aircraft made its maiden flight on 11 January 2011,[1][2] and was officially revealed at the 2016 China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition.[15] The aircraft entered service in March 2017[5] with the first J-20 combat unit formed in February 2018,[5] making China the second country in the world to field an operational stealth aircraft.[16] The J-20 emerged from the late-1990s J-XX program. In 2008, the PLAAF endorsed Chengdu Aerospace Corporation's proposal, Project 718. Chengdu had previously used the double-canard configuration in the J-9, its first design and cancelled in the 1970s, and the J-10.[17][18] In 2009, a senior PLAAF official revealed that the first flight was expected in 2010–11, with a service entry date by 2019.[19] On 22 December 2010, the first J-20 prototype underwent high speed taxiing tests outside the Chengdu Aircraft Design Institute (CADI).[6][20] Three months later, the first J-20 prototype made its maiden flight in Chengdu.[1][2] The first prototype was painted with the number \"2001\". In May 2012, the second prototype took flight in the CADI facility.[21][22] Several changes were made to the third J-20 prototype, numbered \"2011\", which made its maiden flight in March 2014.[23] The new prototype showed increasing sophistication in design, including numerous subtle changes from the first two prototypes.[23] The new airframe introduced modified diverterless supersonic inlet (DSI) intakes, stealth coating, streamlined underwing fairings, and redesigned vertical stabilizers. Analysts noted new equipment and devices for multi-role operations, such as integrated targeting pods for precision-guided munition, and six additional passive infrared sensors can also be spotted around the aircraft.[24][25][26] In December 2015, the low rate initial production (LRIP) version of the J-20 was spotted by military observers.[27][28] The LRIP aircraft revealed dielectric surfaces that were previously painted for prototypes, potentially containing various sensors or baked-in radar absorbing materials.[27] In October 2017, Chinese state media reported that the designs of the J-20 had been finalized, and were ready for mass production as well as being combat-ready.[29] In March 2018, Chinese military revealed other versions of the J-20 platform were being developed.[30] In January 2019, Chinese media reported that a twin-seat variant of the J-20 is rumored to be in development for use in tactical bombing, electronic warfare and carrier strike roles.[31] In November 2019, a J-20 painted in yellow primer coating was spotted during its flight testing by defense observers at the Chengdu Aerospace Corporation manufacturing facility. The aircraft is equipped with a new variant of WS-10 Taihang engines with serrated afterburner nozzles to enhance stealth.[32][33] Report indicated Chengdu Aerospace Corporation terminated the manufacturing of J-20 with Russian engines in mid-2019.[34] Chinese media reported that a new variant of the J-20 was unveiled on July 8, 2020, and entered mass production the same day. The only change mentioned was that the new J-20 was to be equipped with thrust vectoring control.[35] Conflicting reports emerged regarding the exact engine type. Analyst Andreas Rupprecht expressed skepticism regarding the use of Russian engines on the J-20, as he believes that the J-20 is using a variant of the WS-10, which he called the WS-10C. This engine has improved thrust, stealthier serrated afterburner nozzles, and higher reliability, but it is not designed for thrust vectoring, unlike the WS-10 TVC demonstrated on a J-10 in 2018 China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition.[36] Analyst Jamie Hunter believed the new engine type is what he called WS-10B-3, a Chinese-made thrust-vectoring engine demonstrated on the 2018 Zhuhai Airshow.[34] In January 2021, South China Morning Post reported that the J-20 would replace its engines with the WS-10C.[37][38] The WS-10C is considered an interim solution before Shenyang WS-15 passes evaluations. Moreover, WS-10C will not be equipped with the thrust-vectoring version of the J-20 that entered mass production in 2019, which still required further testing. Overall, Chinese engineers believe WS-10C is comparable with AL-31F in performance,[39][40] and the replacement would also reduce China's dependency on Russian engines.[40] The WS-10C-powered J-20 has officially showcased to the public on 28 September 2021 at Zhuhai Airshow.[39][41][42] The development of a twin-seater variant was hinted at by J-20's chief designer in 2019.[43] In January 2021, Aviation Industry Corporation of China released computer renderings of the twin-seat variant of the J-20 fighter in celebration of the 10th anniversary of the jet's maiden flight.[44] In February 2021, a South China Morning Post infographic depicted a twin-seat J-20 variant powered by thrust vectoring WS-10C.[45] In October 2021, a taxiing prototype, dubbed J-20S by analysts,[46][47] was spotted near Chengdu Aerospace Corporation facilities, making J-20S the first-ever two-seat stealth fighter.[48][49] The twin-seat design allows the possibility for the second operator to coordinate attacks and reconnaissance missions from other friendly aircraft via networking or unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) linked via \"loyal wingman\" systems and sensors. The advantage of a second operator includes the potential for better interpreting and exploiting the enormous sensory data that could overload the limited cognitive and processing capacity for a single human, especially in a contested air combat environment.[47][50] In March 2022, Chinese state media reported that the J-20, reportedly with one engine replaced by the WS-15,[51] had performed flight trials.[52] In December 2022, Chinese military analysts indicated the WS-15 was undertaking the last stage of testing and development.[53] In late December, a prototype of the new J-20 variant was observed at Chengdu Aerospace Corporation facilities. The new variant was painted in yellow primer and different from previous J-20 aircraft in airframe design, with a low-profile blended canopy, aiming to optimize transonic flight performance and maneuverability. The new prototype was speculated to be used to test the WS-15 engine and thrust-vectoring.[54][55] In March 2023, the executive of Aero Engine Corporation of China (AECC) announced the serial production of the WS-15 has started.[56][57] FlightGlobal speculated that small-scale production and in-flight testing with the J-20 fighter was underway.[58] On 29 June 2023, a J-20 fighter in yellow primer was observed taking off from Chengdu Aircraft Cooperation airfield fitted with reportedly two WS-15 engines.[51][59] Clear photo of WS-15 equipped J-20A fighter taking flight appeared in 2024.[60] In October 2023, the Pentagon reported that PLAAF was upgrading the J-20, with enhancements such as extended weapon-carrying capability, thrust vectoring nozzles, control systems for unmanned aircraft teaming, and WS-15 high-thrust engines.[61] In November 2024, the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) officially announced the twin-seat variant of the J-20, designated the J-20S. Functions of the variant include long-range operations with multi-role capabilities, including air superiority, precision strikes, manned-unmanned teaming, battlefield surveillance, electronic warfare, and command and control.[62] The J-20 has a long and blended fuselage, with a chiseled nose section and a frameless canopy. Immediately behind the cockpit are low-observable diverterless supersonic inlet (DSI) intakes. All-moving canard surfaces with pronounced dihedral are placed behind the intakes, followed by leading edge extensions (LERX) merging into the delta wing with forward-swept trailing edges. The aft section has twin outward canted all-moving fins, short but deep ventral strakes, and conventional or low-observable[13] engine exhausts.[63][64] One important design criterion for the J-20 is high instability.[65][66] This requires sustained pitch authority at a high angle of attack, in which a conventional tail-plane would lose effectiveness due to stalling. On the other hand, a canard can deflect opposite to the angle of attack, avoiding stall and thereby maintaining control.[67] A canard design is also known to provide good supersonic performance, excellent supersonic and transonic turn performance, and improved short-field landing performance compared to the conventional delta-wing design.[68][69] Leading edge extensions and body lift are incorporated to enhance performance in a canard layout. This combination is said by the designer to generate 1.2 times the lift of an ordinary canard delta, and 1.8 times more lift than an equivalent-sized pure delta configuration. The designer claims such a combination allows the use of a smaller wing, reducing supersonic drag without compromising transonic lift-to-drag characteristics that are crucial to the aircraft's turn performance.[65][66][70] The use of a bubble canopy, extensive flight-control surfaces, and canard configuration for angle-of-attack control indicates J-20's intention to operate in air-superiority missions and within-visual-range engagements. Chief test pilot Li Gang describes the J-20 as having comparable manoeuvrability to the Chengdu J-10 while being significantly better at low-observable (LO) performance. The J-20 is a multirole air superiority fighter, with the interceptor role being just one of the options.[13] The J-20 avionics aim to obtain situational awareness through advanced sensor and data fusion while denying situational awareness to the adversary through stealth and electronic warfare. The J-20 features an integrated avionic suite consisting of multi-spectral sensors capable of providing omnidirectional coverage with.[13][71] Official information on the type of radar that J-20s use has not yet been released publicly. Some analysts believed that J-20s used Type 1475 (KLJ-5) active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar with 1856 transmit/receive modules,[72] but more recent information revealed that this radar was designed for upgraded versions of the J-11D.[73] Other analysts point out that, based on the nose cross-section of the J-20 and known data about a single transmit/receive module surface in the J-16's AESA radar system, J-20s likely contain 2000–2200 transmit/receive modules.[74] A Chinese study commissioned by the military suggested the J-20's AESA radar would have a tracking range of 200 km (120 mi; 110 nmi) with simultaneous tracking for 20 targets, and multi-target engagement capabilities.[71] The nose includes electro-optical sensors for an omnidirectional view, including a chin-mounted enclosed electro-optical sensor with a forward field-of-view for air-to-air applications.[75] In 2015, Beijing A-Star Science and Technology was developing passive sensors, the EOTS-89 electro-optical targeting system and the EORD-31 infrared search and track, for the J-20. The passive sensors enhance the capability to engage stealthy aircraft.[76] The J-20's usage of electro-optical sensors resembles the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II's avionic suite, including the AN/AAQ-37 Distributed Aperture System.[75][12] According to Chinese media in February 2024, the J-20 is equipped to perform airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) operations.[77] The aircraft features a fully-digital glass cockpit with one primary large color liquid-crystal display (LCD) touchscreen, three smaller auxiliary displays, and a wide-angle holographic heads-up display (HUD).[78][79][80] The size of the primary LCD screen is 610 mm × 230 mm (24 in × 9 in), 650 mm (25.63 in) diagonal size, with two illumination systems for operational redundancy.[81] The aircraft is fitted with a helmet-mounted display (HMD) system, which displays combat information inside the pilots' helmet visor and facilities firing missiles at high off-boresight angle.[82][83] The main weapon bay is capable of housing both long-range air-to-air missiles (AAM; PL-15 – PL-21) and precision-guided munitions (PGM; LS-6/50, LS-6/100,[84] FT-7[85]), while the two smaller lateral weapon bays behind the air inlets are intended for short-range AAMs (PL-10). These side bays allow closure of the bay doors prior to firing the missile, enhancing stealth and allowing the missile to be fired in the shortest possible time.[86][87] The main bay may carry four medium/long-range AAMs, with each lateral bay carrying a short-range missile.[88] In 2023, the United States reported that China planned to increase the J-20's missile capacity in \"low-observable configuration\".[61] A staggered arrangement of six PL-15s is possible with modified rail launchers under development.[82] A thinner profile missile, designated PL-16, was also reportedly under development in 2020 to allow the six missiles for internal carriage.[89] The PL-16 features a compressed airframe, folded fins, and a high-performance dual-pulse motor to reduce size, while maintaining the same level of performance as the PL-15.[90] The J-20 will likely use air-to-air missiles to engage in air superiority combat with other aircraft and to destroy high-value airborne assets. Supplemental missions may include launching anti-radiation missiles and air-to-ground munitions for precision-strike missions.[91] The wings include four hardpoints for auxiliary fuel tanks to extend the ferrying range[92] and large weapons, like the PL-17. The J-20 is unlikely to be the primary carrier of such large weapons as they compromise the aircraft's stealth.[93] The J-20 reportedly lacks an internal autocannon or rotary cannon, suggesting a preference for long-range engagements with missiles rather than short-ranged dogfights.[94][95] The J-20 is powered by Shenyang WS-10, an afterburner turbofan engine manufactured by Shenyang Liming Aircraft Engine Company, which reportedly enables supercruise and high maneuverability.[103] The WS-10C served as an interim engine before the adoption of the more powerful Shenyang WS-15.[91] During the prototype and initial service period, the fighter was powered by an improved Lyulka-Saturn AL-31 variant, reportedly the AL-31FM2 developed by Salyut.[98] The engine has a \"special power setting\" thrust of 145 kN (32,600 lbf).[104][105] The Shenyang WS-10B reportedly powered low rate initial production aircraft in 2015,[96] and was used as an interim engine before the adoption of the AL-31.[106][107] There are conflicting reports concerning the powerplant of the TVC-equipped J-20, dubbed J-20B.[35][108] The powerplant has been identified as the AL-31FM2, or a variant of the WS-10; \"WS-10C\" by Andreas Rupprecht,[36] or \"WS-10B-3\" by Jamie Hunter. The TVC-equipped WS-10B-3 was demonstrated at the 2018 China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition.[34] The Shenyang WS-10C was selected as the replacement for AL-31 due to delays on the testing and production of the WS-15 engine.[107] Aircraft powered by WS-10Cs were flying by September 2019.[39] The engine has a thrust of 142-147 kN,[34][39] a thrust-to-weight ratio of 9.5,[102] providing necessary propulsion for J-20 to supercruise, and is fitted with serrated afterburner nozzles for enhanced rear-aspect stealth.[34][39] Flights with prototypes[109] powered by the WS-10C were underway by November 2020.[110] The PLAAF began receiving WS-10C powered aircraft by 2021.[111] In January 2022, it was reported that aircraft powered by the WS-10C would be upgraded with TVC.[99] Reportedly, the WS-10C enabled supercruise.[100][101] The intended powerplant is the Shenyang WS-15[98] with a thrust of 180 kN.[112][113] The WS-15 enables supercruise, enhances maneuverability,[97] and gives the J-20 more thrust than the F-22 and F-35.[51] The engine's extra power and cooling could also be used by future directed energy weapons and sensors.[114][113] The WS-15 development was reportedly ongoing in 2019.[98][107] In March 2022, Chinese state media reported that the J-20 had performed flight trials[53] with the engine and experienced significantly improved performance.[52] It was also reported that eventually, new production and existing aircraft powered by the AL-31 would be fitted with the WS-15.[52] In April 2023, China reported that the WS-15 was ready for mass production.[56] The aircraft is equipped with a retractable refueling probe embedded on the right side of the cockpit, to help the fighter to maintain stealth while flying greater distances.[115] Analysts noted that the J-20's airframe employs a holistic approach to reduce its Radar cross-section (RCS), uniquely combining canard wings with leading edge root extensions (LERX).[30][13] The chined forebody, modified radar radome, and electroconductive canopy[13] use a stealth shaping, yielding signature performance in a mature design similar to the F-22.[116] The diverterless supersonic inlets (DSI) leading into serpentine inlets (S-ducts) can obscure the reflective surface of the engine from radar detection. DSI intakes save weight, reduce complexity, and minimize radar signature. Additional low-observable features include a flat fuselage bottom holding an internal weapons bay, sawtooth edges on compartment doors, mesh coverings on cooling ports at the base of the vertical tails, embedded antennas, and radar-absorbent coating materials.[13][117] While the aircraft's fins/strakes and axisymmetric rear areas may expose the aircraft to radar, the overall stealth shaping of the J-20 is robust and considerably more capable than the Russian PAK-FA.[63][118] Improvements regarding stealth were subsequently introduced - one prototype in 2014 was powered by WS-10 engines equipped with different jagged-edge nozzles and tiles for greater stealth.[119] The J-20 production model with the serrated WS-10C engine is also capable of mitigating negative effects on rear-aspect stealth.[120] Others have raised doubts about the use of canards on a low-observable design, stating that canards would guarantee radar detection and compromise stealth.[121][122] However, these critiques with respect to the canard's RCS may be unfounded.[13] Canards and low-observability are not necessarily mutually exclusive designs. Northrop Grumman's proposal for the U.S. Navy's Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) incorporated canards on a stealthy airframe.[123][124] Lockheed Martin employed canards on a stealth airframe for the Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) program during early development before dropping them due to complications with aircraft carrier recovery.[125][126] McDonnell Douglas and NASA's X-36 featured canards and was considered to be extremely stealthy.[127] RCS can be further reduced by controlling canard deflection through flight-control software, as on the Eurofighter.[128][129] Similarly, Chinese aerospace researchers also concluded that, in terms of stealth, the canard delta configuration is comparable with the conventional arrangement.[130] Composite materials are applied to minimize the J-20's RCS.[75] The DSI enables an aircraft to reach Mach 2.0 with a simpler intake than traditionally required, and improves stealth performance by eliminating radar reflections between the diverter and the aircraft's skin. Analysts have also noted that the J-20 DSI reduces the need for the application of radar-absorbent materials.[131][132] A removable radar reflectors (Luneburg lens) is mounted on the underside of the J-20 to amplify its radar returns, concealing the real radar signature.[75] In the 2021 production model, the emitter is re-engineered to be retractable.[133] In May 2018, Indian Air Chief Marshal B.S. Dhanoa claimed at a press conference that the radars on India's Su-30MKI fighters were \"good enough\" and could detect a J-20 from \"several kilometers away\" while answering a question on whether the J-20 posed a threat to India. However, experienced analysts didn't take Dhanoa's claim seriously due to his exaggeration and the lack of validity.[134][135] Analyst Justin Bronk from Royal United Services Institute noted that Chinese were possibly flying the J-20 with radar reflectors during peacetime for safety and training purposes due to the potential for accidents and identification from other aircraft or ground installations.[136] In a more recent report, Bronk also states that even with limited stealth, J-20 could hide and strike enemy critical platforms in an airspace with background clutter caused by non-stealth fighters and other electromagnetic noise.[91] According to Aviation Week in 2021, the J-20's stealth characteristics were superior to the Sukhoi Su-57 in the frontal aspect but inferior overall - particularly in the rear - to the F-35 .[13] As the program matures with each batch, recently produced models have seen constant and significant enhancement in their stealth profile.[137][138] On 10 December 2010, the first J-20 prototype was observed undertaking high-speed taxiing tests around the Chengdu Aircraft Design Institute (CADI) facilities before the maiden flight.[6] On 11 January 2011, the first J-20 prototype (numbered \"2001\") made its first flight, lasting about 15 minutes, with a Chengdu J-10B serving as the chase aircraft.[1][2] After the successful flight, a ceremony was held, attended by the pilot, Li Gang, Chief Designer Yang Wei and General Li Andong, Deputy-Director of General Armaments.[139] On 17 April 2011, a second test flight of an hour and 20 minutes took place.[140] On 5 May 2011, a 55-minute test flight was held that included retraction of the landing gear.[141] On 26 February 2012, the first prototype J-20 performed various low-altitude maneuvers.[142][143] On 10 May 2012, the second prototype (numbered \"2002\") underwent high-speed taxiing tests, and flight testing that began later that month.[144][22] On 20 October 2012, photographs of the prototype with open compartment doors and a modified pitot tube emerged,[N 2] suggesting the possible inclusion of radar or sensors. In March 2013, images of the side weapon bays appeared, displaying a missile launch rail.[145][146] On 16 January 2014, the third J-20 prototype was revealed, showing new intakes, embedded engine nozzles, and stealth coating, as well as redesigned vertical stabilizers, and an Electro-Optical Targeting System.[119][25][147] This particular aircraft, numbered \"2011\", performed its maiden flight on 1 March 2014 and is said to represent the initial pre-serial standard.[23] By the end of 2014, three more pre-serial prototypes were flown, each with incremental improvements to the design. The fourth prototype \"2012\" was tested on 26 July 2014, sharing many similarities with the \"2011\". This pair of aircraft was reportedly powered by AL-31FM2 engines.[148][149] The fifth prototype, numbered \"2013\", took off on 29 November 2014.[150] Three weeks later, number \"2015\" made its maiden flight on 19 December 2014, indicating rapid construction capability. Both prototypes featured retractable aerial refueling probes and infrared-suppression engine nozzles.[117] The sixth prototype \"2015\" featured a slight alteration to tail booms, suggesting the installation of rear-facing sensors. PLAAF also modified an airliner to serve as the AESA radar test-bed for the J-20 program.[150] On 13 September 2015, a new prototype, marked \"2016\", began testing. It had noticeable improvements, such as apparently modified DSI bumps on the intakes. The DSI changes suggested the possibility of more powerful engines being used than its predecessors, likely to be an advanced 14-ton thrust derivative of the Russian AL-31 or Chinese Shenyang WS-10 turbofan engines. By 2020, the J-20 is scheduled to use the 18–19 ton WS-15 engine, enabling the jet to supercruise without using afterburners. The trapezoidal flight booms around the engines were further enlarged, possibly to accommodate rearwards-facing radars, electronic countermeasures, and jamming equipment. The fuselage was extended to the engine's exhaust nozzles. Compared to its \"2014\" and \"2015\" predecessors, the engine's surface area is further embedded inside the stealthy coating, providing greater rear-facing stealth against enemy detection.[117] On 24 November 2015, a new J-20 prototype, numbered \"2017\", took to the sky. The most significant change in the new prototype was the reshaped cockpit canopy, which provides the pilot with greater visibility. The lack of other design changes suggested that \"2017\" is very close to the final J-20 production configuration. Since '2017' was likely the last J-20 prototype, the low rate initial production (LRIP) of the J-20 is likely to begin in 2016.[151] Chinese media reported that the design of the J-20 was frozen and finalized, as formal ceremonies were held for the prototype \"2017\" after completing the flight testing.[152] The LRIP version later appeared in December 2015.[27] In March 2017, Chinese media reported that the fighter entered service. But it still faced a series of technical challenges that needed to be tackled, including the reliability of its WS-15 engines, the aircraft's flight control system, stealth coatings, hull materials, and infrared sensor.[153] In September 2017, a newly built J-20 prototype (numbered \"2021\") was flight testing with Chinese-made WS-10 Taihang engines, featuring sawtoothed serration edge on its afterburning nozzles.[154] The J-20 with indigenous WS-10C engines began production in 2019.[34][91] In September 2018, it was reported that issues with the development of the WS-15 engine, particularly the reliability of the turbine blades overheating at top speeds were fixed.[155] The WS-15 reportedly required further development after failing final verification testing at the end of 2019.[40] The COVID-19 pandemic imposed further delays.[107] In March 2022, Chinese state media reported that the WS-15 engine completed final testing.[156] In November 2021, the US military reported that the J-20 was gradually receiving upgrades.[157] In the same month, new J-20 two-seater variant began flight testing.[158] In December 2022, the prototype \"2051\" in yellow premier coat took flight. The new prototype had a redesigned canopy section and was speculated for engine and thrust-vectoring testing[54][55] In March 2023, J-20 fitted with one Shenyang WS-15 engine reportedly performed experimental flights.[51] On 29 June 2023, the J-20 prototype \"2052\" equipped with two distinguishable WS-15 engines took flight in Chengdu,[159] captured by Chinese military enthusiasts and spread throughout social media.[59] Another prototype with serial number \"2053\" also reportedly conducted a test flight in the same period with WS-15 engines.[160] Despite the lack of clear pictures, circumstantial evidence such as a photo of the engine installation ceremony, lack of censorship by the authorities, and modified airframe suggested the WS-15 was evidently mounted, though Janes Information Services noted the engines on trial apparently lacks the thrust vectoring control (TVC) paddles, which could be added later.[161][162][163] According to editor of Beijing-based Aerospace Knowledge magazine, vector thrust control and variable cycle engines were \"likely under development\".[164] In 2024, clear photo evidence confirmed that J-20 prototypes took flight with the WS-15, and the engine approached the final stage of testing before serial production.[160][164] Analyst Rick Joe speculated the initial production batch of the revised J-20 model might enter service with WS-10 or WS-15 engine, depending on the circumstances surrounding the development.[7] In late December 2015, a new J-20 numbered 2101 was spotted; it is believed to be the LRIP version of the aircraft.[27] Chinese media suggested the stealth aircraft will enter production ahead of schedule.[165] In July 2016, pre-production models with dark-grey paint and low visibility insignias were spotted inside a Chengdu Aerospace Corporation (CAC) facility. The production rate indicated an intended initial operational capability (IOC) date of around 2017–2018.[166] In October 2017, Chinese media reported that CAC initiated the serial production for the J-20 and is on a path towards achieving full operational capability with the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF). State media described the CAC's production rate as \"stable\", meaning achieving a regular production rate for minimal economies of scale. The production rate was expected to be three aircraft per month.[167][168] In 2019, CAC began manufacturing J-20 fitted with Chinese-made WS-10 Taihang engines.[32] J-20s manufactured after mid-2019 were no longer fitted with Russian AL-31F turbofan engines.[34] The PLAAF began receiving WS-10C powered aircraft by 2021.[111] The production rate of J-20 was expected to be further increased.[169][170] In January 2022, United States Air Force (USAF) analyst Derek Solen estimated 50 to 74 fighters were in service based on open-source intelligence.[171] In August 2022, USAF analyst Li Xiaobing reported that over 150 had been delivered;[172] claims of 150 being in service had been made in 2021.[173] In late-2022, Andreas Rupprecht estimated total production at 208 aircraft - including pre-production aircraft - based on interpreting serial numbers;[174] an alternate interpretation with satellite images estimated 170-180.[159] The International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) reported more than 140 aircraft in service in 2022.[175] According to Bronk, the aircraft at the 2022 China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition had visible improvements to manufacturing tolerance and quality control.[174] According to the Chinese military, CAC accelerated production and delivery by implementing a pulse assembly line. According to Chinese military analysts, this was a response to increasing numbers of F-35 fighters deployed by the United States in the Asia-Pacific.[176][177] In 2023, the reported number of J-20s exceeded the 187 F-22 airframes. IISS reported that more than 200 aircraft were produced by the end of 2023.[178] The Diplomat reported up to 250 aircraft by July 2023, and predicted production reaching 100 aircraft per year by the end of 2023. Defense analysts had predicted the number of J-20s would match the F-22s in 2027.[159] In mid-2024, Janes Information Services estimated that approximately 195 aircraft were in PLAAF service, with more than 70 aircraft inducted between July 2023 and June 2024.[77] Pilot training for the J-20 started as early as March 2017, after the fighter entered limited service in the initial operational capability (IOC) phase. During the IOC phase, the fighters are equipped with radar reflectors, also known as the Luneburg lens, to enlarge and conceal the actual radar cross-section.[179][136] The J-20 participated in its first combat exercise in January 2018, practicing beyond-visual-range maneuvers against China's fourth-generation fighters such as J-16 and J-10C. The exercise was reported to be realistic.[180] Training with mixed generations allows pilots to become familiar with fifth-generation aircraft, and to develop tactics both for and against them.[181] Chinese Ministry of National Defense also revealed that J-20 has conducted night confrontation missions during several coordinated tactical training exercises.[182] The J-20 participated in its first over-ocean combat exercise in May 2018.[183] In April 2022, the J-20 is confirmed to be engaged in regular maritime patrols in the East China Sea and the South China Sea for routine training missions, in a statement released by CAC.[184][185] In March 2023, Chinese state media reported that the PLAAF uses J-20 fighters to simulate the F-35 in surface strike missions during opposing force training. The exercise tested the command chain and kill chain integration between the PLA Ground Force and Air Force, with two branches sharing real-time data for combined air defense missions and training tactics against stealth fighters.[186] On 12 December 2016, at least six J-20s were observed in PLAAF air bases, with tail numbers 78271-78276 identified.[187] Another six were believed to be ready for delivery by the end of December 2016.[188] On 9 March 2017, Chinese media revealed that the J-20 had entered service in the Chinese Air Force,[3][4] making China the second country in the world—after the United States—and the first in Asia to field an operational fifth-generation stealth aircraft.[16] Chinese National Defense Ministry confirmed the service status in September 2017.[180] It is anticipated that frontline units could be equipped with the low observable combat aircraft before 2020. The International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) proposed that, as the trend continues, the US could lose its monopoly on operational stealth aircraft.[189] The PLAAF began inducting J-20s into combat units in February 2018,[5] one month after its first combat drill.[180] The aircraft entered service with the 9th Fighter Brigade based at Wuhu Air Base, Anhui province in late 2018 – March 2019, replacing Su-30MKK fighters previously deployed there.[5][190] On 27 August 2019, the Central Military Commission of the People's Liberation Army approved the J-20 as the PLAN's future primary fighter, beating out the Shenyang FC-31. Arguments for the J-20 state that the plane is far more advanced, longer-ranged, and carries a heavier payload than the FC-31, while those supporting the FC-31 argued that it is cheaper, lighter, and far more maneuverable than the J-20. The J-20 would likely be commissioned upon the Type 003 aircraft carrier under construction, however, the length of the J-20 means that it has to be shortened to be considered operable on an aircraft carrier.[191] On 26 June 2021, Chinese state media reported that J-20 fighters were deployed to PLAAF units monitoring the East China Sea and Taiwan Strait. Analysts suggested that the PLAAF aimed to equip at least one to two brigades in each of the five theater commands before 2026.[192] By 2022, J-20s were deployed in combat units in all five theater commands;[193] this was officially confirmed in September 2022.[194] In March 2022, USAF general Kenneth Wilsbach confirmed that USAF F-35s have encountered J-20s deployed over the East China Sea.[195] In April 2022, Chinese state media reported J-20 started regular patrol in the South China Sea.[196] According to the China Aerospace Studies Institute (CASI), three combat brigades received the J-20 by 2021, another three by 2022, and another two by 2024.[193] In June 2024, Janes reported 12 brigades with J-20s, of which three (1st, 9th, and an unidentified unit at Changsha-Ningxiang) were equipped only with J-20s.[77] Asia Times reported that PLAAF had prioritized deploying J-20s for airbases close to China's maritime border, and believed J-20's long combat range is well-suited for high-speed interceptions, strategic area defense, and long-range strike missions over the First- and Second-island chain.[114] The following is a table of significant milestones in the J-20 program history as gleaned from public sources and cited previously in the present article: Flight testing began with prototypes in late 2010, with maiden flight in 2011. The variant entered serial production in October 2017. J-20 was incorporated into training units of the People's Liberation Army Air Force in March 2017[98] and combat units in February 2018.[5] Initially, this variant was dubbed J-20A by analysts,[120] while the later model with WS-15 engine was dubbed J-20B.[51] Later photo evidence suggested that China called the WS-15-powered variant the J-20A and previous variants J-20.[159] Initially referred to as the 'J-20B'[98][51] by defense analysts. It's an improved J-20 variant with a slightly raised cockpit, enlarged spine, reshaped nosecone, and modified engine intakes optimized for the WS-15 engines. Internal upgrades include an overhaul of software, avionics, and sensor suites, refines in airframe material and structures, improvements in signature reduction, and significant advancements in power and thermal management.[7][60] Prototype #2051 was first spotted in December 2022.[198][199] The twin-seat variant of J-20, designated J-20S. The aircraft was officially revealed at Zhuhai Airshow in 2024.[200]>[201] Initially speculated as J-20S,[61] J-20AS, or J-20B[50] by defense analysts, the twin-seat version of J-20 was first spotted in October 2021,[46] taxiing inside a Chengdu Aircraft Corporation facility in yellow primer paint and untreated composite,[202][203] making it the first twin-seat stealth fighter in the world.[47][46] The twin-seat design allows the possibility for the second operator to conduct airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) missions, which J-20 would leverage its avionics and networking capability to provide battlespace surveillance, battle management, and intelligence analysis. The stealth fighter could act as a more survivable and distributed alternative to traditional airborne warning and command post aircraft.[204] Another possibility is to coordinate attacks and reconnaissance missions from unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) linked via \"loyal wingman\" systems and sensors.[47][50][205] China is known to be developing various \"loyal wingman\" prototypes such as AVIC Dark Sword.[203] In addition to aircraft teaming, a twin-seat configuration may also provide marginal benefits in pilot training and strike missions.[47][203] The advantage of a second operator includes the potential for better interpreting and exploiting the enormous sensory data, which could overload the limited cognitive and processing capacity of a single human.[47][50] The back-seater operator would focus on managing the manned or unmanned aircraft fleet, reducing the pilot's workload in a contested air combat environment.[203][206] With increased automation and artificial intelligence in the aircraft system, the two men crew would likely be able to delegate more complex AEW&C tasks, absorb information, and make tactical decisions.[204] In August 2022, a Chinese defense publication suggested the twin-seat variant could be used as an electronic warfare platform.[207] In October 2022, Chinese media showcased the concept of the J-20 two-seater controlling stealth Hongdu GJ-11 unmanned combat aerial vehicle, and the back seat is designated for the weapons officer.[208][209] It could also potentially manage the LJ-1, a low-end modular drone platform.[210] The first test flight coincided with a visit by United States Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to China, and was initially interpreted by the Pentagon as a possible signal to the visiting US delegation. Speaking to reporters in Beijing, secretary Gates said, \"I asked President Hu about it directly, and he said that the test had absolutely nothing to do with my visit and there had been a pre-planned test.\"[211][212] Hu seemed surprised by Gates' inquiry.[213][214][215] Abraham M. Denmark of the Center for New American Security in Washington, along with Michael Swaine, an expert on the PLA and United States–China military relations, explained that senior officials are not involved in the day-to-day management of aircraft development and were unaware of the test.[212][91] Robert Gates downplayed the significance of the aircraft by questioning how stealthy the J-20 may be, but stated the J-20 would \"put some of our capabilities at risk, and we have to pay attention to them, we have to respond appropriately with our own programs.\"[216] The U.S. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper testified that the United States knew about the program for a long time and that the test flight was not a surprise.[217] In 2011, Loren B. Thompson (Lexington Institute), echoed by a 2015 RAND Corporation report, felt that J-20's combination of forward stealth and long-range puts America's surface assets at risk and that a long-range maritime strike capability may cause the United States more concern than a short-range air-superiority fighter like the F-22.[218][219][220] In its 2011 Annual Report to Congress, the Pentagon described the J-20 as \"a platform capable of long-range, penetrating strikes into complex air defense environments.\"[221] A 2012 report by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission suggests that the United States may have underestimated the speed of development of the J-20 and several other Chinese military development projects.[222] In the early 2010s, Western observers were not able to reach a consensus on the J-20's primary role or its specific capabilities. Experts and analysts called into question many of China's claims and stated it was considered a low observability aircraft but did not fall in the category of a true stealth aircraft based on U.S. Military standards.[223][224][225][226][227] After the deployment announcement in 2018, several analysts noted that the experience that the PLAAF will gain with the J-20 would give China a significant edge over India, Japan, and South Korea, which have struggled to design and produce their own fifth-generation fighters on schedule.[12] However, despite the failure of their indigenous projects, Japan and South Korea would soon operate the imported F-35A in 2019 equipped with better situational awareness and jet propulsion technology, negating this potential technological disparity.[228][229] United States Marine Corps created a full-scale replica (FSR) of a Chengdu J-20 in December 2018. The replica was spotted parked outside the Air Dominance Center at Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport in Georgia. The United States Marine Corps later confirmed that the aircraft was built for training.[230] By 2019, aviation researchers believed that the progress of J-20 signified that China had surpassed Russia in the application of contemporary aviation technologies such as composite materials, advanced avionics, and long-range weapons systems.[231][232] According to Justin Bronk of the Royal United Services Institute, the J-20 is one of the examples of how China has transitioned from the dependency of Russian technology to developing indigenous sensors and weapons that are superior to those of Russia; and how China is beginning to build a clear lead over Russia in most aspects of combat aircraft development in the 2020s.[233] In March 2022, the United States Air Force (USAF) general Kenneth Wilsbach described J-20s were flying professionally and he is \"relatively impressed\" with the Chinese command and control structure and AEW&C capabilities after confirming two nations had an encounter in South China Sea.[195][234] In a separate comment, the general mentioned the E-3 Sentry AEW&C aircraft is insufficient for timely detection of the J-20s.[235] In another press conference, Wilsbach downplayed his earlier remarks, stating that he would not \"lose sleep about the J-20\", USAF Chief of Staff Gen. Charles Q. Brown reflected the same sentiment, but added that the United States needs to keep up the innovation pace in the development of sixth-generation fighter technologies to not \"lose sleep\".[236][237][51] Gen. Mark D. Kelly, the head of USAF Air Combat Command (ACC) added that the United States knows China is on schedule for its 6th-generation fighter program.[238] In June 2022, the US Air Force reactivated the 65th Aggressor Squadron, equipped with F-35A to conduct opposing force training and replicate Chinese aircraft threats.[239][240] Nellis Air Force Base planned to further upgrade its fleet with more F-35s and F-22s to replicate the Chinese fifth-generation fighters.[241] In July 2024, USAF Major Joshua Campbell of CASI recommended that the USAF evaluate the concept of twin-seat J-20 fighters for future combat systems. Campbell found merit in China's approach to human-to-machine interaction in an operationally limited (CDO-L) combat environment with information saturation. He believed the twin-seat J-20, with its secondary pilot serving as a control operator for managing collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) and other aircraft in formation, could serve as an inspiration for the F-15EX program and air platforms beyond traditional roles before more advanced AI decision-maker becomes available.[242] Western sources contribute the idea that J-20 is optimized for anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) engagements, while Chinese sources universally describe J-20 as an air-superiority fighter meant to engage other fighters.[13] Rod Lee, research director at the China Aerospace Studies Institute of the Air University, believes J-20 is intended to be primarily used for destroying high-value airborne assets, which is an alternative way of establishing air superiority. Supplemental missions may include launching anti-radiation missiles and air-to-ground munitions. Rod Lee believes J-20 has the maneuverability to engage in air superiority combat with other aircraft, but PLAAF has de-emphasized the traditional attrition warfare while advocating the \"systems destruction\" approach because they believe it is more effective.[91] Matthew Jouppi of Aviation Week noted the ill-informed assumptions that existed in defense circles and argued that the United States has not adequately addressed threats posed by the increasing Chinese airpower.[13] The visual, physical configuration and stealth shaping have been claimed to be influenced by foreign aircraft, including the F-22, F-35, F-117, MiG 1.44, MiG-31, Rafale, and Eurofighter Typhoon, according to an opinion piece published in The Diplomat by Rick Joe, saying that \"if the J-20 did enjoy any of the benefits of espionage in its development, the visible physical configuration and stealth shaping were unlikely to be the recipients of it\". Instead, Joe adds that the J-20's external physical configuration is a logical development of Chengdu's previous canard-delta designs: the Chengdu J-9 - particularly the \"twin tail, side intake, canard delta\" J-9V-II - from the 1960s and 1970s, and the Chengdu J-10. Furthermore, Joe said that stealth shaping is a much more universal and consistent trait that leaves limited room for variety, and that future international designs will likely reflect this.[120] According to Rouble Sharma of GlobalData, the development of the J-20 showed a robust pace and displayed the Chinese aviation industry's in-house research, design, and manufacturing capabilities. The indigenization of critical components such as the jet engines, avionics, radar, and weapons systems helped to fast-track the production rate, and constant tests and upgrades fixed tethering and performance issues between batches. GlobalData estimated that in 2022, the Chengdu J-20 cost USD 100 million per aircraft, and the whole project cost USD $30 billion.[243] Data from Tsinghua University[245][246] General characteristics [247] Performance Armament Avionics Aircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era Related lists",

                "title": "China Videos Tease Beijing's Newest 'Sixth Generation' Fighter Jets - Newsweek",
                "content": "New footage widely circulating online on Thursday appears to show a Chinese advanced stealth fighter flying for the first time, which could be a major step forward for Beijing's air force if confirmed. Newsweek has reached out via email to China's Defense Ministry for comment. China has been modernizing all aspects of its military, including its air force. The Pentagon said earlier this month that the Chinese air force and naval aviation together made up the \"largest aviation force in the Indo-Pacific region.\" The Pentagon has also described China and \"its increasingly capable military as the department's top pacing challenge.\" Earlier this month, a senior Defense Department official said China's air force, \"with respect to its modernization and indigenization of its unmanned aerial systems, is quickly approaching U.S. standards.\" On Thursday, open-source intelligence accounts shared videos and photos of an unidentified fighter jet. Several accounts, including one on X (formerly Twitter) by Justin Bronk, a senior research fellow for airpower and military technology at the London-based Royal United Services Institute think tank, floated the idea that the footage could show a prototype sixth-generation fighter jet. It is \"fascinating\" that the Chinese military has \"chosen to fly this prototype in daylight now,\" Bronk said, although he cautioned that the footage could actually show a fifth-generation jet known as JH-XX. The footage shows a Chengdu J-20S fighter, a twin-engine all-weather stealth jet, accompanying the unidentified jet, according to The War Zone, a defense news website. The purported sixth-generation jet took off from the headquarters of the Chengdu Aircraft Corp. in Sichuan province, the site said. Multiple countries are developing sixth-generation fighter jets. U.S. fifth-generation fighters like the F-35 are widely flown, and militaries have for years looked for the next jet waiting in the wings. The U.S. Air Force is in the midst of its Next Generation Air Dominance program, designed to replace the F-22 Raptor stealth jet in the next decade, although the future of the program has been cast in doubt. The U.K., Italy and Japan are working together to make a sixth-generation, crewed aircraft under a project called the Global Combat Air Program. In the British Royal Air Force, the aircraft is referred to as Tempest, which is expected to replace the Typhoon jet in 2035, although London is deep in a strategic defense review of the country's military that could affect the sixth-generation program. Russia has said its fifth-generation Su-57 stealth jet can be fitted with sixth-generation features. While it is not clear whether this is a confirmed first sighting of a Chinese sixth-generation fighter, further information and footage will likely come out in the next months.

                "content": "The Shenyang J-35 is a series of Chinese twin-engine, all-weather, stealth multirole combat aircraft manufactured by Shenyang Aircraft Corporation (SAC), designed for air superiority and surface strike missions. The aircraft reportedly has two variants, a land-based variant designed for the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF), and a carrier-based variant optimized for catapult-assisted takeoff (CATOBAR) for the People's Liberation Army Naval Air Force (PLANAF). The aircraft is developed from the FC-31 Gyrfalcon (Chinese: 鹘鹰; pinyin: Gǔ yīng),[4][5][6][7][8] a stealth aircraft prototype that serves as a demonstrator aiming to secure potential export customers after SAC lost the J-XX bid to the Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group. The prototype had often been referred as J-31,[note 1] F-60, J-21, Snowy Owl or Falcon Hawk in various media reports.[10][11][12][13][14] The fighter initially does not feature the J-XX nomenclatures, as such names are reserved for programs launched and financed by the military, while the FC-31 was developed independently as a privately funded venture by SAC.[15][16] The original FC-31 prototype made its maiden flight on October 31, 2012.[1] The People's Liberation Army, particularly the PLA Navy, later took an interest in the FC-31 project, leading to the prototype being further developed with a catapult launch bar and folding wings, and the revised variant took flight on 29 October 2021.[2] The land-based variant emerged in 2023[3][17] and was officially debuted ahead of the 2024 China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition, receiving the designation J-35A.[18] The introduction of the J-35 would make it the second Chinese fifth-generation fighter (after the Chengdu J-20) and China the only country other than the United States to equip two types of stealth fighters.[19][20] While the Chengdu J-20 stealth fighter was officially endorsed by the PLAAF after Chengdu Aerospace Corporation's proposal won the PLAAF bid for the next-generation jet fighter,[21] Shenyang Aircraft Corporation pressed on and developed a private project aiming to secure potential export customers.[15] In September 2011, Shenyang Aircraft Corporation presented the scale model of the FC-31, dubbed the \"F-60\" at an innovation competition held in Beijing.[22][23] In June 2012, a partially assembled F-60 was photographed in a police-escorted road transit through a national highway atop a truck and trailer, with its airframe heavily overwrapped by camouflage covering. Initially, military observers speculated the subject in transit was the Hongdu JL-10 trainer aircraft.[24] A few days later, pictures of a fully assembled fighter aircraft parking on an airfield emerged on the internet, with the new aircraft displaying stealth characteristics, the registration number \"31001\" on the front fuselage.[23] Military observers gave temporary names to the aircraft, such as J-21, J-31, or F-60. Several features were also noted, such as the more conventional airframe design with trapezoidal wings (instead of the canard-delta configuration of the Chengdu J-20) and twin nose wheels,[23][25] leading to the speculation that F-60 could become a carrier-borne aircraft in the future.[26] On 31 October 2012, The first prototype made its maiden flight, accompanied by a J-11 serving as the chase aircraft.[27] In November 2012, The aircraft was officially revealed at Zhuhai Airshow 2012, with the designation Shenyang FC-31, following Chinese export fighter terminology and aircraft such as FC-1 and FC-20.[23] A scale model of the FC-31 was displayed inside the exhibition hall.[28] On 12 November 2014, the FC-31 prototype performed its first public flight demonstration at Zhuhai Airshow 2014.[29][30][31] The prototype was fitted with two Klimov RD-93 engines. Reuben Johnson of Aviation International News noted the prototype was not optimized in its flight performance. The author also noted that another model with modified details was displayed inside the exhibition hall.[32] In 2015, the FC-31 model was displayed first time at a foreign military trade expo, at Dubai Airshow. AVIC official told Aviation Week that the company was pushing the aircraft for export while negotiating with the Chinese government and the People's Liberation Army for further development. Some additional details were given by the FC-31's designer, including its stealth capabilities, payload, and operational range.[33][34] The aircraft was intended to serve as a competitor to the Lockheed Martin F-35 on the export market, especially for countries which cannot join the F-35 program or afford the American fighter.[35][36][37][38][39] There were also persistent rumors of the FC-31 being developed into a carrier-based naval fighter. In 2015, the FC-31's chief designer Sun Cong suggested that FC-31 would succeed Shenyang J-15 in operating on China's aircraft carriers.[29][40][41] In 2015, Jiangsu A-Star Aviation Industries Company marketed its EOTS-86 infra-red search and track as a possible addition to the FC-31.[42] In November 2016, AVIC released a promotional video of an FC-31 prototype, displaying the refinement in construction quality from earlier prototypes.[43] On 23 December 2016, the second prototype of the FC-31 took flight.[39][23] The second prototype features several revisions and upgrades to the aircraft design.[39] The inefficient RD-93 engine was replaced by two smokeless WS-13E engines, the canopy was changed from the two-piece design to a reinforced single-piece glass, and the control surface configuration was overhauled, now with clipped and swept vertical tails instead of the trapezoid tails. Other improvements included modifications to the vertical stabilizers, wings, and airframe, an electro-optical targeting system, a larger payload, improvements in stealth, and upgraded electronics.[44][45] This airframe was eventually painted in low-visibility color with pennant number '31003', leading to speculations of an unseen static test prototype being the '31002'.[23] This prototype was not featured in the Zhuhai Airshow of 2016.[46] Still, a cockpit model with a sidestick controller, multifunctional touchscreen displays, and a heads-up display was showcased in the AVIC booth.[46] The real '31001' prototype aircraft was displayed on the ground in Shenyang, China in 2016.[47] It was displayed again at Zhuhai Airshow 2018, implying China no longer deemed first prototype sensitive technologically.[48] On 21 November 2018, the Aviation Week reported that People's Liberation Army (PLA) has taken interest in the Shenyang FC-31.[49] In June 2020, the Chinese Aeronautical Establishment, the research wing of the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), announced that a \"new fighter\" is under development and will make its maiden flight in 2021. This \"new fighter\" was theorized by media and military analysts as the navalized version of the Shenyang FC-31.[50][51] Due to the lack of an official announcement, military analysis hypothetically designated this variant as 'J-35' or 'J-XY'.[23] New reports indicated that the new variant would feature a bigger radome, navalized functions, and different alignments of control surfaces to reduce the radar signature.[52][53] In June 2021, a mock-up of the FC-31 (J-35) prototype was spotted parked on top of China's carrier test facility, which simulates the flight deck of the Type 003 aircraft carrier.[54] Analysts believe the J-35 could serve in China's future Type 003 aircraft carrier, as well as launched with ski-jump on China's older carriers, complementing the fleet of Shenyang J-15.[55] In July 2021, a static FC-31 with opened weapons bay was displayed inside the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation Expo Park. Analysts noted the similarity of the weapons bay dimension between Chengdu J-20 and FC-31, which means the fighter could accommodate PL-15 missiles and other armaments in similar quantities.[56] On 29 October 2021, the modified carrier-based variant of the FC-31, tentatively named J-35, conducted its maiden flight.[57][58] This new prototype, in blue-green primer paint, features a major redesign. A catapult launch bar and folding wing mechanisms were added, intended for operating on the Type 003 aircraft carrier with its electromagnetic catapult system. A chin-mounted sensor turret, similar to the Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS) on F-35, is featured.[2] The canopy was modified, blending in with the upper fuselage, allowing for more internal fuel load, aerodynamic advantages, and potential to mount sensors behind the cockpit.[59] The overall shape of the first J-35 prototype indicated a developmental lineage from the second prototype of the FC-31.[2][60] On 22 July 2022, the J-35 prototype '350003' was spotted by military analysts. This new prototype was reportedly the second flying prototype and the third overall prototype of the navalized J-35 variant. The new prototype was also painted in the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) grey camouflage, with the PLAN's 'flying shark' logo visible on its vertical stabilizers. The '350003' features sawtooth edges for compartment panels, seamless exteriors, and new engines, reportedly WS-21 or WS-13X, which is a further development of the WS-13E mounted on the second prototype of the FC-31. This engine is fitted with pronounced, serrated exhaust nozzles, helping to reduce rearward radar and infrared signatures.[61][62] A video of the prototype flying was recorded on the same day.[63] In March 2023, the People's Liberation Army Navy released a recruitment video, teasing about the service's future carrier aircraft, which included a rough outline of the FC-31.[64][65] In August 2023, a J-35 prototype was spotted test flying with landing gear extended in China.[66] On 8 December 2023, a mock-up of the J-35 was spotted on the deck of the Type 003 aircraft carrier, which was recently launched and preparing for sea trials at her homeport.[67] On 26 September 2023, the land-based variant of the J-35, tentatively named the J-31 by defense analysts, made its first flight. The land-based variant was distinguished by its smaller wing surface area, single nose wheel, and non-clipped wings, different from the earlier J-35 prototype.[3][17][68] On 13 February 2024, a full-size mockup of the navalized J-35 fighter was spotted aboard China's aircraft carrier Liaoning, under evaluation for potential use on the aircraft deck. The test of the J-35 on Liaoning signified that the fighter is intended to operate not only on catapult-equipped Type 003 but also the older ski-jump (STOBAR) carriers. Analysts also believed the smaller size and lighter weight of the J-35 could provide operational advantages on the Liaoning and Shandong.[69] A few days later on 29 February 2024, the Liaoning embarked to the sea, carrying the J-35 mock-up for further testing.[70] On 13 March 2024, military analysts noted the third flying prototype of the J-35 testing near Shenyang's facilities.[71] On 5 November 2024, the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) officially announced the J-35A, the air force variant of the J-35, would attend the Zhuhai Airshow in 2024 held in the same month.[72][73] The close-up photograph of the J-35A showcased by the PLAAF was painted in grey paint with the Air Force's roundel with the number '75' engraved on the vertical stabilizers, celebrating PLAAF's 75th anniversary.[74][75] Photographs confirmed the differences with earlier naval J-35 on wing size, nose wheel, and vertical stabilizer design.[18] On 12 November 2024, the J-35A conducted its first public flight performance at the Zhuhai Airshow.[76][77][78][79] The Shenyang J-35 development program was initiated as the Shenyang FC-31 project, an export-oriented demonstrator funded by private ventures. There were constant revisions between the prototypes and the later models supported by the Chinese military as different parties had divergent demands and requirements. The navalized J-35 and land-based J-35A were also developed in parallel with different missions and roles, corresponding to their intended operational environment.[23][61][80] In total, there were four notable variants of the FC-31/J-35 development cycle, including the first flying prototype '31001', referred as FC-31 V1 by analysts;[23] The second flying prototype '31003', often referred as FC-31 V2;[23] and the two variants of the land- and carrier-based J-35 fighters.[61][17] The Shenyang FC-31 is a medium-sized aircraft, smaller than the Chengdu J-20, and designed to complement the latter with a lower cost and simpler operations.[81] The twinjet aircraft features a conventional configuration with a blended body and a chiseled nose section, followed by forward-swept intake ramp, diverterless supersonic inlet (DSI) bumps, trapezoidal wings with leading/trailing-edge flaps, all-moving tail-planes, and two canted swept-back vertical stabilizers (the first prototype has triangle stabilizers) with truncated rudders (full-length rudders on the naval J-35).[82][83][75] The initial prototype featured a two-piece canopy, later replaced by a single-piece bubble canopy on the second prototype[23] and the clamshell-type canopy on the J-35 variants.[83] The FC-31 prototype has a twin-wheel nose landing gear, giving provision for the fighter's navalizetion as a carrier-based fighter.[26] The twin-wheel design was late preserved in the naval Shenyang J-35 design,[59] with catapult launch bar added.[2] The naval J-35 also features handholds inside the cockpit,[84] folded wings, and a recovery tailhook to operate on the aircraft carrier.[2][74] On the land-based Shenyang J-35A, the wheel section is replaced by a single-wheel design,[17] and the variant also features a smaller wing area and different vertical stabilizers.[18] Though two variants have separate missions and roles, the shared platform allows easier cross-service joint operations, according to the AVIC.[80] The Shenyang FC-31 features low-observable aircraft designs, focusing on the reduction of the radar cross-section (RCS). To achieve stealth, the control surfaces are edge-aligned, and engine blades are hidden by the serpentine inlets (S-ducts) behind the diverterless supersonic inlets (DSI) bumps, which obscure the reflective surface of the engine from radar detection. The airframe and its internal weapons bay, compartment doors, and embedded antennas are lined with sawtooth edges and covered with radar-absorbent coating materials, both structurally \"baked in\" and applied externally.[45][53][61][85] The early prototype featured simple round engine nozzles, which were redesigned on the later models with serrated edges to reduce radar and infrared signatures.[86] AVIC claims the aircraft is stealthy against L-band and Ku-band radars, and would be low-observable against many multi-spectrum sensors.[33][74] The Shenyang J-35 inherits the FC-31 design with a smooth surface and low-observable characteristics.[75][74] A radar reflector (Luneburg lens) is fitted underneath the J-35 to mask its signatures.[74] The Shenyang FC-31 and Shenyang J-35 are fitted with an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar with a distributed aperture system (DAS)[83] serving as an optical early-warning system[82] and infrared search and track (IRST).[87] The radar advertised for the FC-31 prototype is the Nanjing Research Institute of Electronics Technology (NRIET) KLJ-7A, which is reportedly similar to performance of the AN/APG-81.[82] Under the chin, the fighter is fitted with a electro-optical targeting system (EOTS) turret.[2][82][74] Inside the cockpit, there is a sidestick controller, a conventional heads up display, and a large single-piece multi-function touchscreen display (MFD) of 20 in × 8 in (510 mm × 200 mm) in size.[46][87][88] The pilot is also provided with a helmet-mounted display and sight (HMD/S) system, comparable to that of Striker system made by BAE Systems.[82][87] The flight control system is fully digitalized, with triple redundancy modules and twin data bus.[88] The aircraft is intended to serve as a node in the network of elements with other platforms.[80] Two prototypes of the FC-31 and the later Shenyang J-35 use different engine options. The earliest prototype is fitted with Klimov RD-93 engines.[89] The RD-93 engine was reportedly inefficient, leading to the aircraft to exhale black-colored exhausts.[32][90][91] Replacing the engine with a more efficient, indigenous choices became a priority for the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC).[92] The second FC-31 prototype is fitted with the domestic Guizhou WS-13E engine,[61] an improved variant of the Guizhou WS-13 that powered the JF-17, providing 87.2 kN (19,600 lbf; 8,890 kgf) of maximum thrust. The WS-13E engine is smokeless and more efficient than the RD-93.[39][23] The further developed Shenyang J-35 is powered by the Guizhou WS-21 engine, also known as the WS-13X, a derivative and upgrade of the WS-13E.[61] The WS-21 provides 93.2 kN (21,000 lbf; 9,500 kgf) of thrust,[84] serving as an interim powerplant for the early production J-35.[61] The intended definitive powerplant for the J-35 is the Guizhou WS-19,[93] an engine capable of producing approximately 110–116 kN (25,000–26,000 lbf; 11,200–11,800 kgf) of thrust with a higher thrust-to-weight ratio.[84][94] The J-35 is reportedly capable of supercruise with the WS-19 engines fitted.[75] The FC-31 is equipped with a retractable refueling probe for inflight refueling. The aircraft can achieve a short-take off distance of 450 m (1,480 ft) and a landing distance of 700 m (2,300 ft).[88] The Shenyang FC-31 has a lengthened centerline internal weapons bay[95] with a dimension similar to that of Chengdu J-20.[56][96][75] The weapons bay has six internal hardpoints. Externally, the fighter has six hardpoints on the wings. The first FC-31 prototype can reportedly carry 8,000 kg (18,000 lb) of payload in total, split between the internal carrying capabilities of 2,000 kg (4,400 lb) and external carrying capacity of 6,000 kg (13,000 lb). Under the regular combat load, the fighter has a combat radius of 648 nmi (746 mi; 1,200 km) and maximum take-off weight of 25,000 kg (55,000 lb).[33][34] On the second prototype, the maximum take-off weight is increased to 28,000 kg (62,000 lb) along with a modified fuselage.[82] Inside the weapons bay, the J-35 can carry six air-to-air missiles,[82][97] such as PL-10, PL-15 and PL-21.[97][98] Aside from air-superiority loadouts, the internal bay can also carry precision-strike munitions, with maximum provisions for twelve small diameter bombs, four large deep-penetration bombs of 500 kg (1,100 lb), four supersonic land-attack missiles, or four anti-radition/anti-ship missiles. Externally, the wings allow the maximum provisions of six air-to-air missiles, 18 small bombs, four large bombs of 500 kg (1,100 lb), or four land-attack missiles. Presumably, the operator can mix the combinations of armaments according to the missions.[82] The prototype conducted a high-speed taxiing test and briefly became airborne. On 31 October 2012, prototype No. 31001 conducted the model's maiden flight.[11][99][100] It was accompanied by two J-11 fighters in a ten-minute test flight with its landing gear lowered. With the maiden test flight of prototype No.31001 on 30 October 2012, China became the second nation after the United States to have two stealth fighter designs in field testing at the same time.[99] The aircraft has continued a limited test program, with footage emerging of further flights that took place in February 2013.[101] On 23 December 2016, the second prototype of the FC-31, No. 31003,[45] took its maiden flight.[23] The second prototype featured a modified airframe, with different engines, cockpit, wings, avionics, electronics, and overall dimensions.[39][44][45] The aircraft length was increased from 16.8 m (55 ft) to 17.3 m (57 ft) and the maximum take-off weight was increased from 25 t (25,000 kg; 55,000 lb) to 28 t (28,000 kg; 62,000 lb).[82] A static prototype, No. 31002, presumably existed.[23] The No. 31003 was commonly referred to as the FC-31 V2 by military analysts to distinguish it from the earlier prototype.[23] On 29 October 2021, the third flying prototype of the FC-31, tentatively named J-35, conducted its maiden flight.[57][58] The variant featured catapult launch bar, folding wing mechanisms,[2] modified canopy.[59] Overall, the \"J-35\" prototype was largely seen as the developmental continuation of the FC-31 V2.[2][60] On 22 July 2022, the fourth flying prototype, No. '350003', took its maiden flight. it's reportedly the second flying prototype and the third overall prototype of the \"J-35\" variant, featuring the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) grey camouflage, a more prominent stealth design, and new engines.[61][63] On 26 September 2023, the land-based variant of the J-35, with a different wing and landing gear design, made its first flight. No aircraft designation number was shown.[3][17] On 13 March 2024, another prototype of the J-35 reportedly flew near Shenyang Aircraft Corporation facilities.[71] U.S. military and industry officials believe that once the FC-31 enters service, it will likely be more than a match for existing fourth-generation fighters like the F-15 Eagle, F-16 Fighting Falcon, and F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. They suggest that the capability of the FC-31 against the newest fighters, such as the U.S. F-22 and F-35, would depend on factors such as quantity of the platforms, quality of pilots, and capabilities of radars and other sensors.[105] Western commentaries also focus on the export potential of the aircraft, suggesting that the FC-31 could be attractive to countries which cannot afford the American fighters or face Western export restrictions.[76][78][79] Regional rivals, including India (HAL AMCA) and Japan (Mitsubishi F-X), were pursuing their own programs to develop fifth and sixth generation fighters to counter China's developments, while some of China's other neighbors are considering purchase of the F-35 or Su-57 to foster their capabilities.[106][107][108][109] Some experts have emphasized the FC-31's resemblance to the Lockheed Martin F-35 including their similar size, roles, and wing-tail configurations.[95][110] In 2013, Defense Acquisitions Chief Frank Kendall told a Senate hearing that stolen F-35 data helped U.S. rivals speed up their own fifth-generation fighter projects.[111] In a 2015 article for the Diplomat, Franz-Stefan Gady said that documents leaked to Der Spiegel provided the first public confirmation of theft of top secret data of the Joint Strike Fighter program by Chinese hackers.[112] However, the copying allegation is also called into question by other experts who cite design difference between the two planes. In 2014, David Bignell writing for Air Power Australia said that contrary to the F-35 theft accusation, the FC-31 was modelled on the F-22.[113] In 2012, Vladimir Barkovsky of Russian Aircraft Corporation MiG said that while the FC-31 incorporated features from the F-35, the plane's overall design is \"not a copy but a well done indigenous design.\"[89] Articles by the War Zone and Popular Mechanics said there were limits to how far comparisons between the F-35 and J-35 could be made. As evidence, they cited differences in their design structure, internal subsystems, and operational requirements.[18][53] Writing for The Diplomat, Rick Joe said that design similarities between the two planes might have been more a product of convergence of form of fifth-generation fighters rather than cyberespionage and that whether the J-35 actually benefitted from cyber espionage against the Joint Strike Fighter program would require detailed forensics of both planes.[75] In January 2024, Pakistan announced its intent to acquire the FC-31 aircraft.[114][115] On 3 August 2024, Pakistan's news source reported that Pakistan Air Force (PAF) pilots are currently undergoing training on the Chinese FC-31 stealth fighter aircraft in China. The news of pilot training on the FC-31 itself, however, suggests that Pakistan may be considering acquiring the more advanced J-35 variant, rather than just its export counterpart.[116] In 2024, Egypt is in talks with China to potentially buy FC-31 fighter jets.[117] The specifications denote the FC-31 prototype in development, they are approximate, preliminary, and may not be representative of the Shenyang J-35 variants.[75] Data from Aviation Industry Corporation of China,[88] Aviation Week,[118] Flight Global[119] unless otherwise attributed General characteristics Performance Armament Avionics Related development Aircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era Related lists Media related to Shenyang J-35 at Wikimedia Commons",

                "title": "Jimmy Butler - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Jimmy Butler III (born September 14, 1989) is an American professional basketball player for the Miami Heat of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed \"Jimmy Buckets\", he is a six-time NBA All-Star, a five-time All-NBA Team member, and a five-time NBA All-Defensive Team member. He won a gold medal as a member of the 2016 U.S. Olympic team. Butler played one year of college basketball for Tyler Junior College before transferring to Marquette University. He was selected with the 30th overall pick in the 2011 NBA draft by the Chicago Bulls. In 2015, he was named the NBA Most Improved Player. After six seasons in Chicago, he was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves in June 2017, and was then again traded in November 2018, this time to the Philadelphia 76ers. In July 2019, he signed with the Heat. During his first season with the team, Butler reached the NBA Finals. In 2021, he led the league in steals. In 2023, Butler and the eighth-seeded Heat played in the 2023 NBA Finals, their second appearance in four years.[1][2] Butler was born in Houston on September 14, 1989.[3][4] His father, Jimmy Butler Jr., left the family when Butler was an infant. When he was 13 years old and living in the Houston suburb of Tomball, his mother kicked him out of the house. As Butler remembered it in a 2011 interview, she told him, \"I don't like the look of you. You gotta go.\" He moved between the homes of various friends, staying for a few weeks at a time before moving to another house.[5] Butler maintains a relationship with his parents, saying, \"I don't hold grudges. I still talk to my family. My mom. My father. We love each other. That's never going to change.\"[6][7] In a summer basketball league before his senior year at Tomball High School, he was noticed by Jordan Leslie, a freshman football and basketball player at the school, who challenged him to a three-point shooting contest. The two became friends, and Butler stayed at Leslie's house for a few months, Leslie's mother and stepfather had six other children between them. Butler would later say, \"They accepted me into their family. And it wasn't because of basketball. She [Michelle Lambert, Leslie's mother] was just very loving. She just did stuff like that. I couldn't believe it.\"[5] As a junior at Tomball High, Butler averaged 10 points per game. As a senior and team captain in 2006–07, Butler averaged 19.9 points and 8.7 rebounds per game and was subsequently voted his team's most valuable player. Butler was not recruited coming out of high school and chose to attend Tyler Junior College in Tyler, Texas. After his freshman season at Tyler Junior College, where he had averaged 18.1 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 3.1 assists per game, Butler received interest from Division I programs. Considered a two-star recruit by 247Sports.com,[8] he was listed as the No. 127 junior college prospect in 2008.[9] Butler accepted an athletic scholarship to attend Marquette, where, as a sophomore in the 2008–09 season, he averaged 5.6 points and 3.9 rebounds per game and recorded a free-throw percentage of 76.8%. He moved into the starting lineup as a junior during the 2009–10 season to average 14.7 points and 6.4 rebounds per game and received All-Big East Honorable Mention honors. Butler had two game-winning shots versus UConn and St. John's, to help Marquette finish 11–7 in the Big East and earn its fifth consecutive NCAA tournament appearance. As a senior in 2010–11, he averaged 15.7 points per game and received All-Big East Honorable Mention for the second straight year.

Heat reached the NBA Finals after defeating the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals in six games, earning Butler his first finals appearance.[88] In Game 3 of the NBA Finals, Butler finished with 40 points, 11 rebounds, and 13 assists and became the third player in finals history to record a 40+ point triple-double, joining LeBron James (then with Cleveland) in 2015 and Jerry

                "content": "Save TVs, iPads, smartwatches, fitness gear, air fryers and more When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. With Christmas Day over, you may be stuffed with food and cheer, but I'm here to fly the flag for some great after-Christmas deals that are live right now and well worth a look if you have some spare money or gift vouchers to spend. There are deals from major retailers, including Amazon, Walmart, and Target. And as these companies look to clear their shelves to make way for 2025's products, this could be your last change to score some great deals on TVs, fitness gear, appliances, iPads, and more.How do I know that? Well I've been covering deals for years and happen to be one of TechRadar's Senior Deals Editor, so I know a deal from a dud. As such, I've been digging through the sales pages of big retailers to bring you bagians that I can fully recommend you take a look at. A few standout deals include the all-new Apple Watch SE on sale for $189, this Eufy by Anker smart scale on sale for $23.95, and the highly-rated Tineco wet dry vacuum mop on sale for $99. Do remember that most of today's offers are clearance prices on this year's best-selling items, and you might not see deals like this until the next big holiday sale event. If Mackenzie hasn't flagged a deal for you, then it's not worth your time. That's because Mack has more than a decade of e-commerce experience, and a knack for spotting a great deal amid a mass of shrug-worthy discounts. She can spot a bargain OLED TV from a mile away and will make sure you don't miss great price cuts on AirPods. So you're in the right place for some great after-Christmas deals to buy right now. If you're looking for Apple's cheapest smartwatch, you can get the Apple Watch SE on sale for only $189. While the Apple Watch SE lacks all the bells and whistles found on the Apple Watch 10, it still packs a fast processor, excellent battery life, and plenty of health and fitness features. Get the best compact, single-serve blender for under $50 at Walmart's after-Christmas sale. This is an ideal solution for your daily smoothie or protein shake. With its built-in handle and sippy cup lid, you'll be ready to make your favorite creation just before leaving the house.

The Apple AirTag is one of Apple's highly coveted gadgets and makes a great stocking stuffer. Today's deal from Amazon brings a four-pack down to $69.99, a record-low price. If you tend to misplace your keys or wallet, attach the AirTag to anything you don't want to lose, and your iPhone will locate the item. An air fryer is another popular gift idea, and this NInja Pro model is perfect for families. The 5-quart capacity drawer is enough to make meals for the whole family, and preset functions allow for easy air frying, roasting, reheating, and dehydrating. The compact design means it'll comfortably fit on your countertop, too. Amazon's brand new Echo Spot pairs a 2.83-inch touch with a 1.73-inch front-firing speaker, which might make it the ideal smart alarm clock. With Alexa onboard, you can ask the assistant for the weather, play music, or even schedule alarms. Today's deal is a return to the record-low price. The top-rated Tineco cordless wet-dry vacuum mop combo is on sale for a record-low price of $99 at Walmart's after-Christmas sale.

The Beats Studio Buds have all the essentials you could need at this price. There’s a custom acoustic platform with powerful and balanced sound, along with a choice of ANC or a Transparency mode. The active noise cancellation may not be the strongest around but it does a good job for the price range. There’s also up to eight hours of listening time, while these are sweat and water-resistant so they’re a good option for taking to the gym or on runs. Arrives before Christmas Amazon has Apple's all-new AirPods 4 on sale for $119 – only $1 more than the record-low price.

These headphones also last up to 50 hours on a single charge and can regain five hours of playback time in just 10 minutes of charging. The Sony WH-1000MX4 are older now, but they are still some of the best over-ear headphones ever. These wireless Sony cans package together top-notch audio, excellent comfort, and effective noise cancellation, all at a reasonable price point that's about $100 less than the newer Sony XM5, that is only a minor upgrade. We still rate these as the best headphones for most people, exactly because you can find them at a price like this during holiday sales. Released in 2022, Sony's WH-1000XM5 headphones represent some of the industry's best.

                "content": "The Toledo Rockets football team is a college football program in Division I FBS, representing the University of Toledo. The Rockets compete in the Mid-American Conference. Toledo began playing football in 1917, although it did not field teams in 1931, 1943, 1944, and 1945. Since the inception of the AP Poll in 1936, Toledo has finished in the Top 25 four times. Its highest finish came in 1970 when it ranked No. 12 after finishing 12–0. Toledo has an 11–9 record in bowl games. The Rockets were the 2017 MAC champions. The team's head coach is Jason Candle. Toledo first fielded a football team in 1917, under the leadership of John Brandeberry. According to Toledo Rockets lore, the team began when a group of students purchased uniforms from a sporting goods store, then arranged a game against the University of Detroit in order to settle the debt. Brandeberry stepped in to coach the team, which promptly lost the game 145–0 (but settled the debt).[2] For the first few years Toledo played without a nickname, but was dubbed the \"Rockets\" after two long touchdown runs in a 1923 loss to Carnegie Tech. That season also saw Toledo win its first conference title.[2] Clarence Spears served as the Rocket's head coach and athletics director for seven seasons, from 1936 to 1942. Under his tutelage, the Rockets compiled a record of 38–26–2. which included five consecutive winning seasons.[3] In two seasons, the Rockets compiled a record of 11–10 under head coach Skip Stahley.[4] Forrest England served as Toledo's head coach for two seasons in 1954 and 1955, compiling a record of 9–7–2.[5] In April 1930, Toledo hired Jim Nicholson to become the Rockets first full-time football coach. With his upgraded schedule and organized recruiting, Nicholson helped build UT's team into a powerful and respected program. In his final season, the Rockets finished 6–2–1, including a 63–0 win over rival team Bowling Green. The huge win led to a 13-year break in the rivalry between the two schools. Nicholson help design the Glass Bowl stadium, and continued to be involved in the school's athletics following his retirement by reorganizing the Varsity 'T' Club. He finished his career as the Rocket's head coach with a 20-16-4 record.[6] Clarence Spears continued to help the UT football program grow following Nicholson, with 38 career victories that stood as a UT record for 30 years before being surpassed by Frank Lauterbur's mark of 48 wins. In 1942 when UT's football program was suspended due to WWII, Spears left to take the head coaching job at Maryland. His overall record as head coach for the Rockets was 38–26–2.[6] Although head coach for the Rockets for just two seasons, Bill Orwig established one of the best winning percentages in the program's history (.762). He is one of few coaches in UT to coach two sports at once, overseeing both the football and basketball teams. His overall record as football coach was 15–4–2.[6] Affectionately known at \"FXL\" by his team, Frank Lauterbur coached the Rockets during one of the most successful eras of the program's history. Under his leadership, Toledo won three MAC titles including the first in the school history in 1967, and won both of their two consecutive Tangerine Bowl appearances. The team's 35 consecutive game wins during Lauterbur's era ranks fifth in the longest winning streaks in NCAA Division I football. Charles \"Chuck\" Ealey led the Rockets to all 35 victories as starting quarterback, the most wins without a loss by a quarterback in FBS history. In 1970, the Rockets finished the season ranked 12th in the AP Poll and 17th in the UPI poll. After capping that season with a second Tangerine Bowl victory, Lauterbur took a head coaching job at Iowa. His overall 48–32–2 record at UT includes two perfect seasons in 1969 and 1970.[6] Jack Murphy, an assistant under Frank Lauterbur and coach of Heidelberg, took over as head coach for the Rockets in 1971. In his first season, he led the Rockets to an undefeated 12–0 record, a MAC Championship title, a third consecutive Tangerine Bowl win, and a 14th ranking in the year's final AP poll. That was also the year Toledo's famed winning streak reached 35 games, a streak begun under former coach Lauterbur. Murphy led the Rockets to a 35–32 record before his departure in 1976.[6] Chuck Stobart held the head coaching position for five seasons, rebuilding the Rockets into a stronger program and premier MAC conference contender. He earned MAC \"Coach of the Year\" honors in 1979 and 1981. In 1981, he led UT to a 9–3 record, a MAC Championship title, and a memorable 27–25 victory over San Jose State in the California Bowl that was decided on a last-second field goal by Tony Lee. Stobart left UT to become the head coach at Utah in 1981, departing with an overall 24–31–1 record with the Rockets.[6] Dan Simrell took over the UT football program after Stobart's departure, going on to coach through eight seasons with a total of 50 victories, the third-most wins of any coach in the program's history. In 1984 with a 9–2–1 record, he led UT to a Mid-American Conference title and a California Bowl appearance. A native of Toledo, Simrell was the first UT alum to coach the football team. He lettered as a quarterback from 1962 to 1964 and served as an assistant coach from 1971 to 1981. Overall, Simrell posted four winning seasons of his total eight as head coach, with an overall 50–37–2 record. He resigned following the 1989 season.[6] Nick Saban was head coach of the Rockets for one season, leading Toledo to a 9–2 record and a MAC co-championship in 1990. The two games the Rockets lost that season were by narrow margins: one point to Central Michigan, and four points to Navy.[7] While at the helm of the Rockets, Saban turned down an application of Urban Meyer, who was looking for a job on his staff as an assistant coach.[8] Saban left Toledo after the 1990 season to become the NFL's Cleveland Browns defensive coordinator under Bill Belichick,[9] and later head coaching positions at Michigan State (1995–1999), LSU (2000–2004), the NFL's Miami Dolphins (2005–2006) and Alabama. Gary Pinkel came to Toledo from his post as offensive coordinator at Washington.[10] With an overall record of 73–37–3, he has the most wins in UT history. He also has the second best winning percentage (.659) among UT coaches who led the program for at least four years. Pinkel led the 1995 Rockets to an 11–0–1 record, a Las Vegas Bowl victory, and end of season rankings in the Top 25 of both the AP poll and Coaches poll. In 1997, Pinkel's Rockets took the first-ever MAC West title and appeared in the MAC Championship game. The Rockets finished the season 9–3, with a mid-season ranking high of 18 in the AP poll. They repeated as MAC West champions in the following 1998 season. In Pinkel's final season in 2000, the Rockets went 10–1, including a 24–6 victory over the Penn State Nittany Lions[11] and a 25th-place ranking in the final regular season polls. Following that season, Pinkel took a head coaching position at Missouri.[12] He's been inducted into four college football halls of fame: Toledo, Kent State (his alma mater), the Mid-American Conference,[6] and the Missouri Hall of Fame (in two categories) Known as \"Toledo Tom\", Tom Amstutz led the Rockets to some of the greatest successes, including two MAC Championships, four MAC West titles, and four bowl game appearances. A native of Toledo and former Rocket player himself, was promoted from defensive coordinator, a post he held under Saban and Pinkel, to the Rockets head coach after Pinkel's departure.[13] During his eight seasons as head coach, Amstutz led the Rockets to impressive victories over No. 9 Pittsburgh, Minnesota, Kansas, and Iowa State. Perhaps the greatest though was a 13–10 defeat in 2008 against the Michigan Wolverines in Ann Arbor.[14] The Rockets are the first and only MAC football team to beat Michigan. Amstutz resigned as head coach following the 2008 season.[15] His final record as head coach was 58–41, including victories at the 2001 Motor City Bowl and 2005 GMAC Bowl.[6] In December 2008, Toledo hired Oklahoma State defensive coordinator Tim Beckman as the new head coach for the Rockets.[16] He revived the football program, leading the team through consecutive winning seasons with two bowl appearances and one MAC West Division co-championship. In 2011, the team earned an appearance in the Military Bowl. Beckman resigned at the end of the regular season before the bowl game to take on a head coaching position at the University of Illinois.[17] His record at Toledo is 21–16.[6] Named interim head coach following Tim Beckman's departure for Illinois, Matt Campbell made his debut as the Rockets coach with a 42–41 victory over Air Force in the 2011 Military Bowl.[18] At 32 years old, he was the youngest FBS coach at the time, and went on to enjoy four winning seasons and an overall record of 35–15. The team saw big victories along the way with a win over No. 18 Cincinnati in 2012 and a 2015 upset of No. 18 Arkansas in Little Rock, Toledo's first win over an SEC team.[19] They also went on to a bowl victory over Arkansas State in the 2015 GoDaddy Bowl. Campbell resigned as head coach at the end of the 2015 regular season to accept a head coaching job at Iowa State.[20] Initially planning to following Matt Campbell to Iowa State for an assistant coaching position, Jason Candle changed course and quickly returned to Toledo after the Rockets offered him the head coaching position.[21] Like his predecessor, his first game as head coach was a bowl victory, with the Rockets defeating No. 24 Temple in the 2015 Boca Raton Bowl.[22] In 2017, the Rockets defeated Western Michigan to become the outright MAC West Division champions for the first time since 1998, and their first trip to the MAC Championship since 2004.[23] Toledo went on to defeat Akron 45–28 and win its first MAC Championship in 13 years.[24] In 2022, the Rockets defeated Ball State and Western Michigan lost to Northern Illinois to become the MAC West Division co-champions with Eastern Michigan. Toledo beat Eastern Michigan early in the season so the Rockets had the tie-breaker. Toledo went on to defeat Ohio 17–7 in the MAC Championship. Toledo has been both independent and affiliated with multiple conferences.[25]: 192 The Rockets have won 15 conference titles, with 12 of them being during their affiliation with the Mid-American Conference.[25]: 195–204 The Rockets have won 13 division titles. † Co-champions Toledo has appeared in 22 NCAA-sanctioned post-season bowl games since 1969, and has an 12–10 record overall.[26] Other Football Facilities: Toledo and Bowling Green have a rivalry, nicknamed \"The Battle of I-75\", dating back to 1924, when BGSU challenged the participation of Toledo's captain, Gilbert Stick, after it was discovered that Stick also played for a local team in Genoa, Ohio. Conference rules did not prohibit such play, and BGSU's protest was overruled.[2] In 1950, Toledo's athletic director charged BGSU students a higher price for tickets at a basketball game than the general public, while rumors spread of a dog-napping attempt by BGSU against Toledo's mascot.[28] Another incident came in 1951, when a fight broke out after a hard hit by a BGSU player on fullback Mel Triplett. Don Greenwood, then Toledo's coach, participated, and resigned after the university failed to back him up. In Greenwood's view, the officials should have called a penalty for excessive roughness, and he had a duty to protect his players.[2] Four players in the history of the University of Toledo have had their jersey numbers retired.[6] Announced schedules as of August 11, 2024.[29]",

                "content": "Caleb Sequan Williams (born November 18, 2001) is an American professional football quarterback for the Chicago Bears of the National Football League (NFL). Following one season of college football with the Oklahoma Sooners, he played for the USC Trojans and won the Heisman Trophy in 2022 after setting single-season school records in passing yards and touchdowns. Williams was selected first overall by the Bears in the 2024 NFL draft. Williams was born on November 18, 2001, in Washington, D.C., later attending Gonzaga College High School, where he played high school football.[1][2] As a sophomore in 2018, he led Gonzaga to a WCAC Championship as the best team in the District, and was named Washington Post All-Metropolitan 1st team and Washington, D.C. Gatorade Football Player of the Year after he passed for 2,624 passing yards with 26 touchdowns and rushed for 394 yards and 10 touchdowns.[3] As a junior in 2019, he was named Washington Post All-Metropolitan 1st team for the second consecutive year after he passed for 1,770 yards with 19 touchdowns and rushed for 838 yards with 18 touchdowns. He was named the Elite 11 finals MVP the following summer.[4] In 2020, his senior season was cancelled due to COVID-19.[5] The highest-rated quarterback prospect of his class, Williams committed to play college football at the University of Oklahoma.[6][7][8] Williams entered his true freshman season with the Oklahoma Sooners in 2021 as the backup to Spencer Rattler,[9][10] before assuming the role as starting quarterback midway through the Sooners' rivalry game with the Texas Longhorns in the team's sixth game of the season.[11] In that game, Oklahoma was down 35–17 before Williams replaced Rattler and led the Sooners to a 55–48 victory.[12] He finished with 212 passing yards, two passing touchdowns, 88 yards rushing, and a rushing touchdown.[13] Williams made his first start the following week, against Texas Christian University, and threw for 295 yards, four touchdowns, and rushed for 66 yards and a rushing touchdown as Oklahoma won 52–31.[14] Williams finished his freshman year with 21 passing touchdowns, six rushing touchdowns, and four interceptions in seven games.[15] On January 3, 2022, Williams entered the transfer portal, and on February 1, he announced that he had transferred to the University of Southern California to play for the Trojans, reuniting him with head coach Lincoln Riley, who had been the head coach for the Sooners before being hired away by the Trojans the previous November.[16][17] Williams was named the starter on August 25[18] and team captain on August 31.[19] In his first start against Rice, he went 19/22 with 249 yards and two touchdowns, as USC won 66–14.[20] He became the AP College Football Player of the Year, USC's first winner since Reggie Bush in 2005,[21] and was named the 2022 Heisman Trophy winner.[22] His 42 passing touchdowns led the NCAA.[23] Williams and the Trojans went 7–5 in 2023 during the regular season, throwing for 3,333 yards with 31 passing and 11 rushing touchdowns.[24][25] He declared for the 2024 NFL draft following the season, finishing his college career throwing for nearly 10,000 yards with 120 total touchdowns.[26] As is the school's tradition for Heisman winners, his number 13 was retired by USC in 2024.[27] Williams was selected first overall by the Chicago Bears in the 2024 NFL draft. The Bears traded the previous year's first overall selection to the Carolina Panthers to acquire the pick used on Williams, also acquring D.J. Moore and several other selections in the said trade.[30] He was one of six quarterbacks taken in the first round, tied with the 1983 draft for the most in NFL history.[31] Williams was named the starter in May.[32] He signed his four-year rookie contract, worth $39.4 million fully guaranteed, on July 17, 2024.[33][34] As his college number 13 was taken by Keenan Allen, Williams switched to his high school number 18 in the NFL; the announcement was made less than half an hour after his draft selection.[35] Williams' draft night merchandise sales value broke a Fanatics record.[36] Williams was the first quarterback selected first overall to win their season-opening NFL debut since 2002, completing 14-of-29 passes for 93 yards with no touchdowns or turnovers in a 24–17 win against the Tennessee Titans.[37] Williams recorded his first two career touchdowns and set the Bears' single-game rookie passing record with 363 yards in a 21–16 loss to the Indianapolis Colts in Week 3.[38] After a 1–2 start, Williams led victories over the Los Angeles Rams and Carolina Panthers, throwing for over 300 yards and two touchdowns against Carolina, becoming the first Bears rookie quarterback with multiple 300+ yard games.[39] In Week 6 in London, Williams threw four touchdown passes in a 35–16 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars, leading Chicago to their first three-game win streak since 2020 heading into the bye week.[40] In Week 8 against the Washington Commanders, Williams led a late go-ahead touchdown drive, but the Bears lost on a last-second Hail Mary, later dubbed the Madhouse in Maryland.[41] Chicago’s struggles continued with back-to-back losses to the Arizona Cardinals and New England Patriots. The Bears offense failed to score a touchdown and Williams was sacked 15 times, marking the first time since 2004 that Chicago did not score a touchdown in consecutive games.[42][43] Williams ended his four-game touchdown drought in a Week 12 overtime loss to the Minnesota Vikings, throwing for 340 yards, two touchdowns, and setting the Bears' rookie passing yards record.[44] On Thanksgiving against the Detroit Lions, Williams threw three touchdowns and set a rookie record for consecutive passes without an interception, but poor late-game clock management cost the Bears a chance at a comeback as they lost their sixth straight game, resulting in the firing of head coach Matt Eberflus the following day.[45][46]",

                "title": "Chelsea (given name) - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Chelsea is an English given name derived from the Old English place name ċealc hȳð,[1] or the modern Celcyth, meaning chalk landing place. The name evolved to Chelsea, a location on the River Thames that became a London borough known for its wealthy, socially influential residents. Many locations have been named after the English place name Chelsea.[2] The given name, a transferred use of the place name, was in use for boys in the New England region of the United States by the late 18th century and was first used for American girls in the 1840s.[2] The name was first popularized for girls in larger numbers in the United States by American comedian Chelsea Brown, who was born Lois Brown but chose Chelsea as a stage name. After Brown began appearing on the American television program Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In in 1968, the name quadrupled in use for American girls to 48 uses that year. The name debuted among the 1,000 most popular names for American girls in 1969, in 702nd place. Chelsea Morning, a 1969 hit song written about mornings in Chelsea, Manhattan by Canadian singer Joni Mitchell and later performed by Judy Collins, further popularized the name for girls with its descriptive lyrics such as \"the light poured in like butterscotch.\"[2] The name of Chelsea Clinton, daughter of American President Bill Clinton and former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, was inspired by the song when she was born in 1980. The name Chelsea increased further in popularity in the 1980s due to its use for film and television characters, such as Chelsea Thayer Wayne, a character played by Jane Fonda in the 1981 American film On Golden Pond and Chelsea Reardon, a character played by Kassie DePaiva on the American soap opera Guiding Light beginning in 1986. In 1992, the name reached peak popularity in the United States and would have been the eighth most popular name for American girls in that year if all spellings of the name were combined. The name dramatically declined in use in 1993, during the first year of Bill Clinton's presidency. At the time, it was out of fashion in the United States to name children after politicians and those who were associated with them. The name has continued to decline in use, but remained among the 1,000 most popular names for American girls in 2023.[2] Spelling variants in use in the United States include Chelsey, Chelsi, Chelsie, and Chelsy.[2] The name has also been in regular use throughout the Anglosphere, including Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, as well as in Belgium, France and Netherlands.[3]",

                "content": "Todd Andrew McLellan (born October 3, 1967) is a Canadian professional ice hockey coach and former player who currently serves as head coach of the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League (NHL). He previously served as head coach of the San Jose Sharks, Edmonton Oilers, and Los Angeles Kings, and as an assistant coach with the Red Wings, with whom he won the Stanley Cup in 2008. He was drafted in 1986 by the New York Islanders and played five games with the major league club in the 1987–88 season before retiring in the minors the following season due to recurring injury. After living in Goodeve, Saskatchewan, and Melville, Saskatchewan, during his childhood, McLellan started his playing career with the Saskatoon Blades of the Western Hockey League (WHL) from 1983 to 1987. In the 1986 NHL Entry Draft, he was drafted by the New York Islanders in the fifth round. He played a total of five games at the NHL level, spending most of two seasons with the Islanders' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Springfield Indians. However, recurring shoulder injuries dating back to his junior hockey days ended McLellan's North American playing career after the 1988–89 season. He scored his only NHL goal on his league debut on December 28, 1987, in a 6-4 loss to the New Jersey Devils. He returned home to study at the University of Saskatchewan for a year, before resuming his playing career for S.IJ. Utrecht of the Eredivisie in the Netherlands. During his three seasons there, the team hired a new coach, who moved in with McLellan and made him a player-coach, which McLellan recognizes as why he became interested in coaching.[1] Following his stint as a player-coach with SIJ Utrecht, McLellan returned to Canada in 1992. He went into full-time coaching in 1993, being hired as the coach of the North Battleford North Stars of the Saskatchewan Junior League. In 1994, McLellan was hired as the head coach and general manager of the Swift Current Broncos of the WHL, where he succeeded Graham James. In his six seasons with Swift Current, the Broncos qualified for the WHL playoffs in all seasons. McLellan himself was named WHL Executive of the Year in 1997 and Coach of the Year in 2000.[1] Following his successes at the junior level, McLellan was hired by the expansion Minnesota Wild to coach their minor league affiliate, the Cleveland Lumberjacks of the International Hockey League (IHL). After the IHL folded in 2001, McLellan and his staff were transferred to the Wild's new minor league affiliate, the Houston Aeros of the AHL. As coach of the Aeros, McLellan led Houston to the Calder Cup in 2003.[1] In 2005, Mike Babcock selected McLellan to serve as his assistant with the Detroit Red Wings. In Detroit, McLellan was tasked with handling the Red Wings' forwards and managing the team's power play, as well as reporting player performance to head coach Babcock. Under his watch, the Red Wings had the top-ranked power play in the NHL, finishing first in power play efficiency in 2005–06 and third in 2007–08. As a member of the coaching staff, McLellan won his first Stanley Cup with the Red Wings in 2007–08.[1] On June 11, 2008, the San Jose Sharks hired McLellan to become their new head coach, replacing Ron Wilson.[2] He would end up the head coach for the Western Conference All-Star team, and lead the Sharks to their first Presidents' Trophy with an NHL-leading 117 points to finish the regular season, and finished third in voting for that season's Jack Adams Award, behind winner Claude Julien and Andy Murray. On March 14, 2013, with a 4–3 victory over the Los Angeles Kings, McLellan became the winningest coach in Sharks history with 207 victories.[3] On February 5, 2014, against the Dallas Stars, McLellan tied Darryl Sutter for the most games coached in Sharks history with 434.[4] After the team missed the playoffs in the 2014–15 season, McLellan and the Sharks agreed to mutually part ways on April 20, ending his tenure as the Sharks' winningest coach.[5] He coached the Canadian national team at the 2015 World Championship, where the team won the title for the first time since 2007 with a perfect 10–0 record.[6] On May 19, 2015, he was named head coach of the Edmonton Oilers, becoming the 14th head coach in team history. He succeeded Todd Nelson, who took over on an interim basis after Dallas Eakins was fired. At the time of his signing, McLellan became the highest-paid coach in NHL history, earning around $3 million per season.[7] However, he would hold the distinction for exactly one day, as McLellan's former colleague Mike Babcock signed an eight-year contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs worth around $6.25 million per season on May 20.[8][9] McLellan's first season in Edmonton was a rebuilding one. The Oilers finished with 70 points, the second-worst record in the league. However, the following season—the first in the team's new arena, Rogers Place—saw a dramatic turnaround. The Oilers tallied over 100 points for the first time since the 1980s dynasty years. On March 28, 2017, the Oilers defeated the Los Angeles Kings 2–1 to make the playoffs for the first time in 11 years. They also earned home-ice advantage in a playoff series for the first time since winning their last Cup in 1990. They upended McLellan's old team, the Sharks, in six games to win a playoff series for only the sixth time since 1990. On November 20, 2018, McLellan was fired by the Oilers and replaced by Ken Hitchcock after posting a record of 9–10–1.[10][11] On April 16, 2019, the Los Angeles Kings named McLellan head coach.[12] On February 2, 2024, he was fired, despite signing a one-year contract extension nearly four months prior that would have kept him behind the bench through the 2024–25 season.[13] Before his firing, Los Angeles stumbled after a strong 20–7–4 start to the season, losing 14 of McLellan's final 17 games with a 3–8–6 record.[14][15] On December 26, 2024, McLellan returned to the Red Wings, with the team hiring him as head coach after the dismissal of Derek Lalonde.[16] In 1992, McLellan married his wife Debbie. They have two sons, Tyson and Cale.[1]",

                "content": "All of today's best Boxing Day deals picked by the experts When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. There's perhaps no single day of the year that's better for bagging a bargain on in-demand tech in the UK than Boxing Day (aside from, you know... Black Friday). This year's Boxing Day is no exception as several of the nation's best retailers have launched wide-ranging sales tailor-made for those looking to spend their Christmas spending money. As TechRadar's deals editor, I've covered the Boxing Days sales for over three years now so I've got plenty of tips and know-how to share with our readers. I've been busy searching Amazon, Currys, John Lewis, and many other retailers to find record-low prices on tech that we've tested and loved here at TechRadar. You'll find my definitive list of the 36 best deals in the Boxing Day sales below, including laptops, TVs, headphones, and many more popular categories with our readers. While it's hard to pick favourites, today's highlights include the excellent LG B4 OLED TV for just £749, the Apple AirPods Pro 2 for £179, and the superb Nikon Z6 III camera for just £1,999. These are all record-low prices on top models here on-site so they get an easy recommendation - although there's plenty more to check out below. The Sony WH-1000MX4 are older now but they are still some of the best over-ear headphones ever. These wireless Sony cans package together top-notch audio, excellent comfort, and effective noise cancellation all at a reasonable price point that's about £70 less than the newer Sony XM5 that are only a minor upgrade. We still rate these as the best headphones for most people because you can find them at a price like this during major sales. The latest wearable in Fitbit's range of dedicated fitness trackers has dropped back to its cheapest price in the current Amazon sale - just in time for that new year fitness push. It's a small but welcome £40 saving on a device we found lighter, prettier and smarter compared to the previous version in our Fitbit Charge 6 review. Key features include a seven-day battery life, onboard GPS and GLONASS, sleep tracking, smart wake, SpO2 blood oxygen tracking and all the other features the excellent Charge 5 offered. This entry-level electric toothbrush is a solid pickup while it's less than half price in Amazon's latest sale. It doesn't boast many impressive high-end features but it has the basic ones you really need to brush your teeth effectively and efficiently, including a two-minute timer and a visible pressure sensor. Plus, you get a handy carry case included for free. The Shark Stratos has all you could need from a vacuum cleaner and at a very good price after this huge discount. It has a cartridge system which protects against dust cup odours that always come alongside pet hair and dander. Its Clean Sense IQ technology knows when to adjust the power and you won’t have to worry about hair getting trapped and wrapped up in the brush-roll. Meanwhile, 60 minutes of runtime should suit most homes. Amazon's last-minute deals sale has the top-rated Blink Video Doorbell on sale for £29.99 – which matches the record-low price. The Blink Video Doorbell is a cheap and easy way to get alerts to your phone when motion is detected or when guests are at your door. It features infrared night video, long-lasting battery life, compatibility with other smart devices and displays, and two-way audio to speak to visitors. Here's a strong saving on some of the best bone conduction headphones for runners that we've tried thanks to their impressive audio quality, comfortable fit and safety features. The Shokz OpenRun offer an eight-hour battery life, but you can also fast-charge them for ten minutes before going for a run in order to grab a full 90 minutes of juice. The Fire HD 8 tablet is unlikely to make it into our list of the best tablets but if you're after a cheap tablet that does the basics well, then you'll be more than satisfied. It's not the most powerful device but this cheap and durable tablet lasts up to 13 hours, making it good for light use and watching videos. It's still at its Black Friday price - but not for long. I'm sneaking this one into my tech roundup as it's an excellent late gift idea for the puzzle fan in your life. Much like the Wordles, Heardles and Connections of the world, you can expect dozens of bite-sized puzzles in this collection. Each one asks you to solve silly and increasingly elaborate crimes by using the clues to eliminate suspects, weapons and locations in a strange but compelling mix of Cluedo and Sudoku. This is an excellent low price for Google's previous generation flagship phone that boasts some smart AI features in the heart of the phone and improves how you experience it. It is for this reason that the Pixel 8 Pro tops our new list of the best AI phones. The 6.7-inch display is as good as the iPhone 15 Pro Max and the camera is equally impressive. The phone will also fix any of your past Google Photos, even if they were taken with a different phone. All that, plus a free Fitbit, make this an excellent deal. New record-low price: The LG B4 may be the entry level OLED in LG's 2024 TV lineup, but it delivers spectacular picture quality with rich contrast and fine details, along with a wealth of gaming features including 4K, 120Hz, Dolby Vision gaming, VRR and more. Available for the first time in 48-inches, this deal takes the newest size down to a record low of under £700 -- easily the cheapest way to get a 2024 OLED TV! Lenovo IdeaPad 3: was £399 now £249 at Currys Display - 15.6-inches Processor - Intel Core i3 RAM - 8GB Storage - 128GB I usually recommend Chromebooks for those on a tight budget but I think this Lenovo IdeaPad 3 is a surprisingly decent low-cost Windows 11 choice. Sure, it's not a world beater but you are getting 8Gb of RAM and a Core i3 chipset here, which are enough to cover the basics. Generally speaking, these specs won't carry you far but they'll work if you're simply going to use your laptop for writing documents, streaming shows, or answering emails. Samsung Galaxy Book4 Edge: was £849 now £599 at Currys Display - 15.6-inches Processor - Snapdragon X Plus RAM - 8GB Storage - 256GB I don't think I've ever seen a laptop with the fancy new Snapdragon X Plus chipset go for cheaper than this Samsung at Currys - and by quite a stretch, actually. At £600, this is an absolute bargain price for a laptop that's tailor-made for powerful performance and industry-leading battery life. This is a particularly strong option if you want a MacBook but can't quite make the budget stretch - although you do only get a relatively small 256GB storage drive here. Asus Vivobook 15: was £849 now £599 at Currys Display - 15.6-inch OLED Processor - Intel Ultra 5 RAM - 16GB Storage - 512GB Currys is knocking it out the park with its mid-range laptop deals this Boxing Day - case in point: this Asus Vivobook 15. You're getting a massive £250 discount here on a machine that's not only loaded-up with 16GB of RAM and a brand-new Ultra 5 chipset, but also a stunning 3K OLED display. For £600? This is a good performer that's great for consuming all types of media. Recommended. I've seen a lot of people talk about and use Loop earplugs lately so if you want to see what the fuss is all about then this entry-level pair is down to a record-low price. Use them to block out noise on a commute, help you focus in the office, protect your ears from loud music at bars or concerts, or help you create a better environment for sleep. They're reusable and can last for up to five years so a good investment if you'll be a regular user. This compact capsule coffee machine is incredibly easy to use, virtually mess-free, and comes bundled with a handy milk-frother for lattes and cappuccinos. The set usually sells for around £130 at Amazon but has now hit a record-low price in the Boxing Day sales. Even though the console has only just come out, EE has already taken £40 off the brand-new PS5 Pro. What's more, if you have an existing PS5 to trade in, you can get up to another £260 off, bringing the price to as little as £399. The upgraded PS5 Pro boasts greater power over the base console, enabling select games to look better and run smoother. Plus, there's 2TB of storage included, which is double the amount in the standard PS5. Just know, though, that this console doesn't have a disc drive so you'll need to buy all of your games digitally on the PS Store – or buy the PS5 Disc Drive accessory and attach it to the console to play physical games. This beats the discount we saw last year by £20 on the latest generation Apple AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C support. As well as that more universal connection option, Apple's newest premium earbuds come with sought-after improvements to audio quality and noise cancellation. In our AirPods Pro 2 review, we said that these upgrades ensured they were a big step up compared to the originals and helped them truly compete with other high-end buds. This MSI Cyborg is a strong contender for gaming laptop deal of the day over at Currys thanks to its solid line-up of an RTX 4060 graphics card, Intel Core i7 chipset, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB SSD. Put together, these are great specs for 1080p gaming and today's massive £200 price cut easily makes this one of the best bang for the buck machines going currently. Recommended. Here's a great deal on a cheap 4K TV that's even cheaper than Black Friday. A £50 saving might not seem like much, but this TCL 55V6BK was already sitting cheap at £300 considering it supports 4K resolution, HDR 10, and comes with Android TV built-in for easy streaming. Don't expect an incredible picture here or super speedy gaming performance, but for a budget option - solid. This budget tablet has been hovering around the £100 mark for a few weeks now but Amazon has just issued a brand-new record-low price on the Honor Pad X8a. We haven't reviewed the 'a' version of this tablet, but we have reviewed the standard X8 and found it to be a solid budget choice. This is a slightly upgraded version with more RAM, a bigger battery, and a more powerful chipset. In short, it's just a way better tablet and one that's likely to stack-up well against the other budget options from Amazon and Samsung in this price range. Breville sandwich maker: was £35 now £25 at AmazonA Christmas gifting classic - who hasn't given or received a Breville sandwich maker at some point? Right now, this well-loved appliance is sitting at the cheapest price all year at Amazon - cheaper than on Black Friday, in fact. There's not much to say here - this is just a great deal on a solid appliance that's perfect for warming and toasting all kinds of breads, sandwiches, and paninis. Throw out that crusty old kettle and get great results every time with this Ninja Black Perfect Temperature Kettle. Featuring rapid boil and six different settings, this appliance is a must-have if you're serious about getting the perfect brew every time. As the name suggests, the Fire TV Stick 4K streams shows and movies on your TV in ultra-high 4K resolution. It's a good offer for a solid streaming stick that comes with access to all the major apps and supports voice controls through Alexa. Be aware, though, that the previous generation version has been as low as £22.99 before - but that was almost three years ago. Chances of seeing that price again are slim as this discount seems to be the new normal for the upgrade streaming stick and the old version has been discontinued from sale. Lego at Argos: get 20% off with codeYou can use the code LEGO20 at check out to knock a massive 20% off the listing price of a massive range of LEGO kits at Argos today. There are over 150 individual kits eligible for this discount, including Disney, Harry Potter, Mario, and other well-known crossover brands. £70 is, in my opinion, the ideal amount to add to your wallet - especially when you save £10.50 with code DIGITAL15. This gift card will give you more than enough to pick up a popular AAA game like Marvel's Spider-Man 2 or a good few months of PS Plus. Here's a great option if you're looking for a relatively cheap Windows laptop in this year's Boxing Day sakes. With a 12th gen Intel Core i5 chipset, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD, you're getting good specs for basic computing tasks with this Asus Zenbook. The main selling point for this model, however, is the 2.4k resolution display and slick lightweight 14-inch form-factor, which makes it great if you need something portable. Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra: free Chromebook with contract at Mobiles.co.ukThe phones retailer Mobiles.co.uk is throwing in a free Samsung ChromeBook Go with specific Galaxy S24 Ultra contracts this week - a pretty damn good bundle deal if you were thinking about upgrading. While not all of the retailer's plans are eligible for the freebie here (it's mostly ID Mobile and Vodafone options), the laptop is still worth about £250 by itself. Certain plans also come with free Galaxy Buds3 also so be on the lookout for those. It's rare to find such a big 50-inch inch 4K TV for under £259 so this Hisense A6N is an easy recommendation - even if it isn't a world-beating set. You won't get an amazing picture here, or high-end gaming performance but this Hisense will get you streaming 4K content with Dolby Vision and HDR10+ support for a great price. Again, worth a look if you're on a budget this December. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 isn't a device for everyone - it is, after all, incredibly expensive. With that said, today's deal at the EE Store cuts a whopping £730 off this device via cashback - which is a stunning deal considering this is for an unlocked device. Even better still, you don't need to trade-in for this particular promotion, unlike with other similar discounts at the major networks and Samsung itself. This Asus Vivobook laptop has just hit a new record-low price at Very. At just £749, this high-end laptop is an absolute steal considering you get a 3K OLED display, powerful Ryzen 9 processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. While it's not a cheap laptop by any stretch of the imagination, this one will have no issues powering through most tasks with its superb chipset and gorgeous OLED display. If you're looking for a slightly bigger smart home display, Amazon has the latest Echo Show 8 on sale for £94.99. That's back to the record-low price I saw during Black Friday. The eight-inch display allows you to make calls, watch movies, check the weather, and control compatible smart home devices completely hands-free thanks to Alexa compatibility. The addition of room-filling spatial audio gives a big boost to all of these features to improve sound quality. The iPad 10.2 is a little older model but it remains a great deal at this discounted price ahead of Boxing Day. The 10.2-inch Retina display and A13 Bionic chip ensure excellent picture quality and superior performance to this day. If you need an entry-level slate for web browsing, streaming videos, light admin work or playing basic games then this can do it all without issue. Right now, when it comes to powerful and affordable tablets that offer excellent value for money, nothing else can beat the Apple iPad 10.2 at this price. The Ninja Double Stack is a great-looking air fryer packed with key features. It has a capacity of 7.6 litres across the two baskets with six preset functions and two independent cooking zones. Its functions include roasting, baking, and dehydrating, so there’s something for every cooking plan here. It cooks up to 55% faster than your fan oven so it’s a great money and timesaver. TechRadar's top camera of 2024, the Nikon Z6 III, is available with an incredible £700 price cut at Jessops right now. This fantastic mirrorless camera was just released a few months ago and features an impressive 24.5MP full-frame partially stacked sensor with vastly improved autofocus and 6K video up to 60fps. Our Nikon Z6 III review awarded this excellent camera a full five stars out of five, which feels like excellent value now with this incredible record-low price. PSVR 2 is an incredible VR headset for PS5, and it's since been updated to work on PC. This bundle featuring Horizon: Call of the Mountain is the same price as the headset by itself at a new record-low price, so this is the version I'd recommend if you want the most bang for your buck. Especially as the accompanying game is a killer app for PSVR 2. Display - 13.6 inchesProcessor - Apple M2RAM - 8GBStorage - 256GB As suspected, with Apple bumping up the base memory of the MacBook Air M2 and M3 to 16GB, retailers are cutting the prices of their existing stock of models with 8GB. While not the most powerful MacBook out there, this version with the M2 chip remains an excellent all-rounder, especially when it comes to day-to-day tasks like browsing the internet and writing up documents. For this new low price, you'll struggle to find a better value laptop than this, even if there's less memory than I'd like to see.

Whether you’re after Apple AirPods, Charlotte Tilbury make-up or Ganni fashion, plenty of the discounts rival Black Friday.

Looking to scratch that post-Christmas shopping itch? Fear not, as the IndyBest team of shopping experts and I are on hand with a curated guide to the best Boxing Day discounts. Keep scrolling for the ones I’d snap up. Read more: Follow Boxing Day deals live IndyBest’s shopping experts track the price of popular products year-round and have covered Boxing Day sales and other major shopping events for years, so we know how to spot a good deal from a bad one. On top of knowing our way around a sale, we are experts in our fields. We’ve spent countless hours testing and reviewing everything from air fryers to TVs. Within our Boxing Day sale guides, we only recommend deals on products we’ve tried and tested from brands we trust. That means we bring you genuine savings on products we think you’ll love as much as we do. According to The Independent’s tech critic David Phelan, these are among the best earbuds and offer a “significant improvement over the already-splendid first-generation model”. Noise-cancelling is twice as good; you get six hours on a single charge, rather than five; there are touch controls on the buds themselves, so you can adjust the volume without having to take your phone out of your pocket, and there’s a MagSafe case with a lanyard loop for easy charging and storage. Now reduced to their lowest-ever price, trust me, you don’t want to miss this post-Christmas deal. If Santa didn’t leave a Dyson airwrap under the tree, fear not, as Boots is offering a stellar (and rare) saving on the cult tool for Boxing Day. Available in a limited edition strawberry blush hue, the airwrap boasts six attachments, from two barrels to a coanda smoothing dryer, a round volumising bristle brush, a flat brush and a diffuser. Helping you create super sleek curly styles with the barrels and a voluminous bouncy look thanks to the brushes, there are endless styling options. It’s a non-negotiable in my own routine while beauty tester Louise thought the same, with the tool earning a spot in her round-up of the best hot brushes. Since this affordable Ninja air fryer entered my kitchen, meal times have never been easier. Proving that air fryers don’t have to dominate your kitchen counter space, this design is sleek and space-saving. Better yet, it comes with a 30 per cent discount at Currys. It also received rave reviews from tester Lauren, was noted that despite “using up to 75 per cent less fat than traditional frying methods, you still get a good crunch. Its generous 3.8l basket can fit a medium-sized chicken and allows you to air fry, roast, reheat and dehydrate”. What more could you want? Taking the top spot in IndyBest’s guide to the best winter duvets, this 15-tog design from Dunelm now has 20 per cent off. “Cosy and luxurious, this duvet guarantees winter-ready warmth,” said assistant eCommerce editor Sarah when she put the duvet to the test. “While it is synthetic, it is incredibly plush and soft with a down-like feel and has the classic rustle sound you’d expect from a natural filling. Plus, because it’s made with polyester, it’s suitable for anyone looking to avoid feathers.” You can also save on the design in single, king and super king sizes. Want to upgrade your cookware? Save 40 per cent on the price of this chic Le Creuset casserole dish, which is reduced in both the navy and grey mist colourways at John Lewis. Whether you’re using it in the oven, on the hob or under the grill, this dish will help you serve up mouth-watering meals in style. Even better, the sturdy cast iron design comes with Le Creuset’s lifetime guarantee – what’s not to love? While this isn’t a saving on the mattress itself, Simba is offering free items with selected mattresses. So, if you’re moving home or really want to invest in your sleep, this could be a great way to save money. For example, if you purchase the hybrid luxe, you’ll also receive two hybrid pillows, a hybrid duvet and a performance mattress protector for free, saving you £766 if you were to purchase them separately. The mattress also comes IndyBest-approved, as it took the top spot in our round-up, where sleep expert Sarah Jones praised the hybrid luxe for providing “decent support”, being “breathable” and “naturally temperature-regulating”. Treat yourself to a little pick me up with this duo of Glossier’s bestselling lip balms. The set features two limited edition flavours – biscotti and espresso, perfect for keeping your lips supple and hydrated throughout winter. One balm dotcom costs £16, so for just £2 more, you’ll get an extra to keep in your handbag. What more could you want? Our resident IndyBest electric toothbrush tester Steve named this the best model in his review, the Oral-B Pro 3 combines great cleaning performance with a budget-friendly price compared to rival brushes. The Oral-B Pro 3 is discounted to around £50 fairly regularly, so this Boxing Day deal might be your last chance to catch it at its cheapest price this year. One of my favourite beauty cleansers, Elemis’s pro-collagen cleansing balm has reached cult status for very good reason. It even landed a spot in beauty expert Louise’s review of the best cleansing balms, in which she noted, after she’d removed the product from her face, her skin “felt soft and smooth, with a subtle glow that you often find after having a facial. From start to finish, the experience is a luxurious treat”. I’m restocking while the formula is on sale, to give my skin some TLC ahead of the new year. Samsung’s smart ring tracks your health metrics around the clock, offering you wellness tips and insights into your activity, stress levels and sleep quality without the need to wear a watch. When tech critic Alex reviewed the Galaxy Ring review, he said it has “one of the best design choices we’ve seen for a smart ring”. Now, I’ve spotted a major £80 discount at Currys for Boxing Day. The end-of-year sales are one of the best times to upgrade your phone, particularly when there are deals like this one from iD Mobile at Carphone Warehouse. The 100GB plan on the Apple iPhone 16 has you paying just £99 up front and then £39.99 per month. That’s a total of £959.76 over the course of the 24-month plan (mid-contract price bumps not included). In The Independent’s tech editor’s review of the latest iPhone, Andrew said it “is a powerhouse of innovative technologies that is due to become even more powerful in the months to come”. One of the most-wanted gaming Christmas gifts this year, FC 25 was sure to be wrapped up under many a tree; however, if you did miss out, PlayStation has just the deal for you with more than 50 per cent off for Boxing Day. According to resident gaming wizz Alex, the latest iteration “isn’t just the same game with players donning new kits” and rather, includes everything “from a new game mode and a new FC IQ system to new player roles and better tactical options.” Wow, sign me up. The vertuo pop is Nespresso’s most affordable coffee machine – and, naturally, it’s been tried and tested by the team at IndyBest. Spoiler alert: Lauren loved it. Now, you can invest for nearly half price thanks to John Lewis. Receiving a glowing five-star review, she praised the “small but mighty” machine that will slot seamlessly into most people’s kitchen countertops. “Weighing in at just 3.5kg, if you have a large cupboard and won’t be using the machine every day, it’s also incredibly easy to store away until you need it,” she added. I love the colours available, too, with the blue and yellow brightening up your kitchen surfaces. This cult brand’s hoodies were rated highly in my review of the best blanket hoodies, where I found the oversized hoodie to be cocooning and warming. Complete with a hood, sleeves and practical front pouch, the hoodie is finished in a plush soft-to-touch flannel fleece with sherpa fleece lining the inside. Large enough to curl beneath it on the sofa but still sufficiently fitted and lightweight to move around the house while working from home, the Oodie is a saviour when temperatures plummet. Right now, you can pick one up for less than £30. “If you’re looking for a sleep tracker, activity tracker or just want to know as much as you can about your body, then the gen 3 Oura ring will tick a lot of your boxes, in one tiny package,” Kat said in her review of the fitness device. With six different coloured rings available (from silver to gold), it’s a more stylish choice than a Fitbit or Garmin. When Kat tested the device out, she was impressed with its battery life and sleep insights, as well as fertility and period tracking. Right now, the Oura gen3 ring is the cheapest I’ve ever seen at Amazon. Run, don’t walk. Apple’s nifty AirTag trackers haven’t been this cheap in years. “For any iPhone owner prone to losing things, investing in a pack of four might be one of the best decisions you ever make,” tech wizard Alex wrote in his review of the best key finders. “Precision tracking works wonderfully well when you can get a signal, and the fact it’s powered by removable batteries is a real bonus.” A must-have for travel in 2025, add these to your basket pronto. Right now, there’s up to 50 per cent off a range of jewellery at Missoma, including these molten hoop earrings. Providing a subtle twist on the classic hoop style, this pair is made with 18ct gold plated vermeil on sterling silver and comes complete with butterfly closures. Whether you’re looking to refresh your everyday ear stack or want something to complete your New Year’s Eve look, this goes-with-everything pair is now less than £60. One of the top names in coffee makers, Delonghi features in home appliance tester Zoe’s review of the best coffee machines. Here’s a deal on a more compact model at Currys, which offers a simple bean-to-cup extraction thanks to its 13-setting burr grinder and one-touch operation. I’ve just moved house, so this is the perfect choice for my smaller kitchen – it’s gone straight in my basket. IndyBest writer Lois loved Our Place’s always pan when she tested it, owing to its non-stick abilities and how it’s made from “post-consumer recycled aluminium”. She also liked the “satisfaction from cooking on such an uncannily smooth surface”. I’ve got the spice colourway in the always pan and can confirm it’s just as enjoyable to display as it is to cook with. With five hues to choose from, you can tailor it to your kitchen interiors. Here’s a £275 saving on the MacBook Air from 2020, which is still a powerful, versatile and lightweight laptop with an impressive all-day battery life. This festive deal at Laptops Direct sees Apple’s best-selling laptop reduced to just £650 for Boxing Day. The post-Christmas sales are prime time to give your interiors a refresh. Case in point, the mega Dusk sale, where you can save an extra 15 per cent right now with the code “FLASH15”. This Hampshire style secured a spot in our round-up of tried and tested corner sofas, where our reviewer named it the best traditional-style chaise sofa. “Dusk’s Hampshire chaise sofa is a triumph of both form and function – and, as with all of the brand’s offerings, it is enticingly affordable, given its high quality,” they said. Now, you can save more than £400 – and I’m sold. One of my favourite budget make-up buys, Maybelline’s New York sensational sky high mascara is even more affordable thanks to this Amazon deal. Boasting a uniquely designed brush that’s long, thin and densely packed with tiny little plastic bristles, it’s ideal for getting to hard-to-reach areas and easy to manoeuvre with minimal mess. When assistant eCommerce editor Sarah reviewed the mascara, she raved about the tiny bristles that line the wand, which she found “helped comb through each and every lash – yes, even those pesky ones right in the corner”. You can pick it up for just £7 right now.

                "content": "Eugene Cyril Smith III[2] (born October 10, 1990) is an American professional football quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the West Virginia Mountaineers, leading them to multiple bowl games, breaking numerous passing records, and garnering multiple awards before being selected by the New York Jets in the second round of the 2013 NFL draft. After two inconsistent seasons as the Jets' starting quarterback, Smith eventually lost his starting position due to injuries in his final two years with the team. Smith then spent time as a backup for the New York Giants and Los Angeles Chargers before unexpectedly making a career resurgence as the Seahawks' starting quarterback in 2022, earning his first Pro Bowl selection, having his first winning record and playoff berth as a starter, leading the league in completion percentage, and ultimately winning the Comeback Player of the Year award. Smith was born to high school students Eugene Smith Jr. and Tracy Sellers in Miramar, Florida on October 10, 1990.[3][4] His family originally hails from Bimini in the Bahamas. His great-uncle, Danny Smith, was a record breaking All-American hurdler at Florida State, and his cousin Mel Bratton was a star running back at Miami in the mid-1980s.[2] Smith's nickname, Geno, came from his grandfather, who was nicknamed \"Big Geno\".[5] Smith was admitted to Norland Middle School's magnet program, which dedicated two hours per day to arts instruction.[6] He went on to attend Miramar High School, where he was coached by former Mountaineer Damon Cogdell.[7] As a junior, Smith passed for 2,200 yards, 25 touchdowns, and three interceptions, and was named second-team all-state quarterback. He was also named second-team all-Broward County as an athlete for 2007.[8] Following his junior year, Smith was invited to the prestigious Elite 11 quarterback camp in Aliso Viejo, California.[9] During Smith's senior season, he led his team to the state 6A semi-finals and completed 205 of 338 passes for 3,089 yards and 30 touchdowns while also rushing for over 300 yards. Smith was a first-team all-state selection in Florida Class 6A and a Parade All-American.[8] He was also the No. 1 rated player in Broward County according to the Miami Herald and South Florida Sun Sentinel, and finished No. 2 in the voting for Mr. Florida.[8] Smith finished his career as the third-best passer in Broward County history, and was named to the ESPN Top 150 prospects list. He chose to attend West Virginia over offers from Florida State, South Florida, Boston College, and Alabama.[10] Sources: Smith attended West Virginia University, where he played for the West Virginia Mountaineers football team from 2009 to 2012.[11] Smith was an English major during his time at West Virginia.[12] Smith saw some action his freshman year as the backup behind senior Jarrett Brown.[13] His first snap in a regular season game came against Auburn; Smith completed five of eight passes for 50 yards and an interception.[14] He would see action again against Syracuse, Marshall, Louisville, and in the Gator Bowl against Florida State.[15] In his freshman year at West Virginia University, Smith completed 32 of 49 passes for 309 yards, a touchdown, and an interception for an 81.1 quarterback rating to go along with 17 carries for seven yards as the backup to starting quarterback Brown.[16] 2010 was Smith's first year as the starting quarterback. Smith got his first start in the season opener against the Coastal Carolina Chanticleers, completing 20 of 27 passes for 216 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception in the 31–0 shutout victory.[17] With the Mountaineers down 21–6 against in-state rival, Marshall, Smith led his team to a fourth quarter comeback victory. He led the first drive from the Mountaineers' 4-yard line. With help from senior running back Noel Devine, the Mountaineers cut Marshall's lead to eight points. After the Mountaineers' defense stopped Marshall, a punt put the Mountaineers near their own end zone again, starting from the 2-yard line. After completing 9 of 13 passes and scrambling for 20 yards, Smith found tight end Will Johnson in the corner of the endzone for a touchdown. With Marshall still leading 21–19, head coach Bill Stewart elected to go for the two-point conversion. Smith completed a pass to wide receiver Jock Sanders in the back of the end zone for a two-point conversion. The Mountaineers went on to win the game in overtime by a score of 24–21. Smith finished the game completing 32 of 45 passes for 316 yards and a touchdown to go along with 14 carries for 13 yards.[18] After two games, Smith led the Big East Conference in passing yards and passing efficiency.[19] In a 31–17 victory over Maryland, Smith completed 19 of 29 pass attempts for 268 yards and four touchdowns. Two of his touchdowns were to Tavon Austin, and the other two were to Stedman Bailey.[19][20] Smith won his first Big East Offensive Player of the Week for this performance. In West Virginia's first meeting ever with LSU, the Mountaineers lost at Tiger Stadium by a score of 20–14. Smith completed 14 of 29 pass attempts for 119 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception to go along with five carries for 10 yards.[21] Smith threw for 220 yards and ran for 19 yards in West Virginia's 49–10 win over UNLV.[22] It was the most points WVU had scored since playing Connecticut in 2007.[23] During a 16–13 overtime loss to Connecticut, Smith completed 22 of 34 passes for 160 yards to go along with a season-high 64 rushing yards. This was the first game all season where Smith did not throw a touchdown pass. The loss was also the first time Connecticut had ever beaten West Virginia.[24] Smith tied his record for touchdowns in a game in a 37–10 win over Cincinnati, where he was 15 for 25, throwing for 174 yards, four touchdowns, and an interception. The win came after a two-game losing streak. It was the first time the Mountaineers beat Cincinnati since 2007.[25][26] Smith won his second Big East Offensive Player of the Week for this performance. On November 26 against Pittsburgh, Smith threw for 212 yards and three touchdowns in the 35–10 victory.[27] In the next game against Rutgers, he had 352 passing yards and a touchdown in the 35–14 victory.[28] Smith finished the 2010 season with 196 passing yards, a touchdown, and an interception in a 23–7 loss to North Carolina State in the Champs Sports Bowl.[29] Smith finished his sophomore season completing 241 of 372 passes for 2,763 yards, 24 touchdowns, and seven interceptions to go along with 106 carries for 217 yards.[30] With the arrival of new West Virginia football head coach Dana Holgorsen and a new passing-based offensive system, Smith saw his passing numbers improve drastically. In the fourth game of the season against the #2 LSU Tigers, Smith set school records for completions (38), attempts (65), and passing yards (463) in the 47–21 loss on September 24, 2011.[31] With 372 passing yards against the Cincinnati Bearcats on November 12, Smith tied a Big East record with his seventh 300-yard game of the season. He tied the record that was set in 2007 by Brian Brohm of the Louisville Cardinals.[32] Smith set single-season school records for pass completions (291), attempts (448), and yards (3,741) on November 25 in a win against the rival Pittsburgh Panthers.[33] All three records were previously held by Marc Bulger.[34] In West Virginia's 70–33 rout of the Clemson Tigers in the 2012 Orange Bowl, Smith tied three individual bowl records: most touchdown passes (six), most touchdowns overall (seven) and total points (42).[35][36] Smith's 401 passing yards broke Tom Brady's Orange Bowl record of 396 that he set in the 2000 Orange Bowl. Smith also became the Big East single-season passing leader with 4,379 yards, breaking Brian Brohm's mark that he set in 2007. As a senior, Smith put together multiple great statistical performances for the Mountaineers. In the season opening victory over Marshall, he finished 32-of-36 for 323 yards and four touchdowns.[37] In the next game, a victory over James Madison, he finished 34-of-39 for 411 yards and five touchdowns.[38] On September 29 against Baylor, Smith had a career-day, completing 45-of-51 passes for 656 yards and eight touchdowns in the 70–63 victory.[39] In the next game, a victory over Texas, he finished with 268 passing yards and four touchdowns to help lead the Mountaineers to a 5–0 record.[40] After the win over Texas, the season started to falter for the Mountaineers. Despite some solid individual results, Smith and the Mountaineers dropped the next five games. On November 23, Smith had 236 passing yards and two touchdowns in a victory over Iowa State to stop the losing streak.[41] In the regular season finale against Kansas, he finished 23-of-24 for 407 yards, three touchdowns, and an interception in the 59–10 victory.[42] In the Pinstripe Bowl against Syracuse, he finished with 201 passing yards and two touchdowns in the 38–14 loss.[43] Smith finished the season with 4,205 passing yards, 42 touchdowns, and six interceptions to go along with 66 carries for 151 yards and two touchdowns.[44] After the season, he officially announced his decision to enter the 2013 NFL draft. Smith received an invitation to the NFL Scouting Combine where his performance was well received by scouts who highlighted his athleticism and strong arm[46] but noted that his ball placement needed improvement.[47] Smith was widely regarded as one of the top prospects alongside EJ Manuel of Florida State.[48] In the days leading up to the draft, several NFL teams expressed interest in Smith including the Kansas City Chiefs (No. 1 selection), the Jacksonville Jaguars (No. 2 selection), the Oakland Raiders (No. 3 selection), the Philadelphia Eagles (No. 4 selection), the Buffalo Bills (No. 8 selection), and the New York Jets (No. 9 and No. 13 selections).[49] Smith was in attendance for the first round of the draft as many analysts and scouts expected him to be taken that night.[53] However, Smith was not selected, and EJ Manuel was the lone quarterback taken in the first round.[54] Smith declined to be interviewed by ESPN afterwards and originally planned to return home but later decided to attend the second day of the draft.[54] Several league executives alleged Smith did not handle the draft process in a professional manner, which caused him to fall out of the first round,[55] while analysts pointed to his late-season decline as a senior at West Virginia, which exposed his flaws, as the primary reason.[56] The following day, the Jets expressed interest in trading up in the second round to select Smith but could not consummate a trade.[57] Despite this, Smith remained available and the Jets selected him with the 39th overall pick.[58] Following the selection, General manager John Idzik stated that Smith would compete with incumbent Mark Sanchez in training camp to determine the starting quarterback.[59] Smith fired his agency, Select Sports Group, upon the completion of the draft and sought new representation.[60] He signed with Roc Nation Sports on May 22, 2013, with Kimberley Miale serving as his representative.[61] Smith worked out in his home state of Florida during the offseason, prompting questions as to whether or not he had spurned Sanchez by not attending Sanchez's Jets West summer camp in California.[62] Smith and Sanchez dismissed this notion with Sanchez saying that it was \"no big deal.\"[63] On July 22, 2013, Smith signed a four-year, $5 million contract with approximately $690,000 in workout bonuses.[64][65] Smith made his professional debut on August 9, 2013, in the first preseason game against the Detroit Lions.[66] He completed 6-of-7 passes for 47 yards but left the game due to an ankle injury in the second quarter.[66] X-rays showed no structural damage and Smith returned to practice on August 11.[67] Smith started the Jets' third preseason game against the New York Giants completing 16 of 30 passes for 199 yards, a touchdown, and three interceptions.[68] Smith was named the team's starting quarterback after Sanchez suffered a shoulder injury against the Giants.[69] During the season-opening 18–17 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Smith completed 24-of-38 passes for 256 yards, a touchdown, and an interception. With only a few seconds left in the fourth quarter, he was hit out of bounds by Lavonte David, which drew a late hit penalty and the Jets went on to score the game-winning field goal.[70] In the next game against the New England Patriots, Smith struggled as he completed 15 of his 35 passes for 214 yards, a touchdown, and three interceptions as the Jets lost on the road by a score of 13–10.[71] The following week against the Bills, Smith completed 16 of 29 passes for 331 yards, rushing for a touchdown and passing for two touchdowns and two interceptions. Despite 20 penalties, the Jets powered through and won 27–20.[72] Smith became the first rookie quarterback in franchise history to throw for 300 or more yards in a game.[73] Smith struggled in the Week 4 38–13 road loss to the Tennessee Titans.[74] He completed 23 of his 34 passes for 289 yards and a touchdown while committing four turnovers—two led to Titans touchdowns as the Jets lost 13–38.[74] During a narrow Week 5 30–28 road victory over the Atlanta Falcons, Smith completed 16 of 20 passes for 199 yards and three touchdowns.[75] He completed all four of his passes on the Jets' final drive,[75] allowing Nick Folk to kick the game-winning 43-yard field goal.[76] Smith was named American Football Conference Offensive Player of the Week[77] and Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Week for his performance.[78] In the next game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Smith threw for 201 yards and two interceptions as the Jets lost by a score of 19–6.[79] The following week against the Patriots, he completed 17 of 33 passes for 233 yards and scored two touchdowns as the Jets won by a score of 30–27 in overtime.[80] Smith struggled during the Week 8 9–49 road loss to the Cincinnati Bengals as he completed 20-of-30 passes for 159 yards and two interceptions that were returned for touchdowns before being relieved of duties by Matt Simms in the fourth quarter.[81] Smith started in the next game against the New Orleans Saints and completed eight of 19 passes for 115 yards to go along with six carries for 18 yards and a touchdown in a 26–20 upset victory.[82] The Jets returned from their bye week to lose three straight contests to the Bills, Baltimore Ravens and Miami Dolphins. Smith struggled during this stretch as he failed to score any points and committed eight turnovers;[83][84][85] he was benched in favor of Simms against Buffalo and Miami leading coach Rex Ryan to be noncommittal in starting Smith the rest of the year.[86] Smith showed gradual improvement as the Jets won three of their final four games. During a Week 14 37–27 victory over the Raiders, Smith completed 16 of his 25 passes for 219 yards, a touchdown, and an interception to go along with five carries for 50 yards, keeping the team in playoff contention.[87] In the next game against the Carolina Panthers, Smith performed well until throwing a costly pick six in the fourth quarter.

Despite this incident, Smith was allowed to start in the next game against the San Diego Chargers, in which he threw for only 27 yards with an interception and was benched for the second half in favor of Michael Vick as the Jets were shut out on the road 31–0.[97] Prior to the Week 5 game, Smith and a few of his teammates missed a team meeting, having gone to a movie theater in San Diego, unaware of the three-hour time difference between the Eastern and Pacific Time Zones.[98] Smith started in the Week 6 31–17 loss to the Denver Broncos, throwing for 190 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception.[99] During a 27–25 road loss to the Patriots in Week 7, Smith threw for 226 yards and the Jets combined for 218 rushing yards, but the potential game-winning drive fell short due to a blocked field goal.[100] In the next game, Smith lasted only ten minutes to begin regulation as he completed 2-of-8 passes for five yards and three interceptions against the Bills, and was subsequently benched in favor of Michael Vick. His passer rating for that game was 0.04.[101] In the regular-season finale against the Dolphins, Smith led the Jets to a 37–24 road victory, completing 20 of 25 passes for a career-high 358 yards, three touchdowns, no interceptions, and a perfect passer rating. This was his first perfect game, the sixth in Jets history, and the only one of the 2014 season.[102][103] Smith finished his second professional season with 2,525 passing yards, 13 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions to go along with 59 carries for 238 yards and a touchdown in 14 games and 13 starts.[104] On August 11, 2015, Smith was involved in an altercation with defensive end IK Enemkpali in the locker room over a $600 unpaid debt.[105] Smith suffered a fractured jaw after Enemkpali punched him in the face. Smith was ruled out for 6–10 weeks, and Enemkpali was released by the Jets shortly thereafter.[106][107] Two days later, Smith underwent surgery on his fractured jaw.[108] Ryan Fitzpatrick led the team to a 2–0 record while Smith was injured, so new head coach Todd Bowles decided to continue starting Fitzpatrick, even with Smith being healthy. During a Week 8 34–20 road loss to the Raiders, Smith entered the game in relief of Fitzpatrick, who left the game with an injured thumb. Smith completed 27 of 42 passes for 265 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception to go along with two carries for 34 yards.[109] This was his only appearance in 2015.[110] With Ryan Fitzpatrick re-signing with the Jets, Smith continued to remain in the backup role.[111] During a Week 6 28–3 road loss to the Arizona Cardinals, Smith came in after Fitzpatrick was benched for poor performance.

The start made Smith the first black quarterback to start for the Giants and the first quarterback to start for both the Giants and the Jets; it also meant every NFL team had started a black player at quarterback, with the Giants being the last team to do so.[119] Making his first start with the Giants, Smith threw for 212 yards and a touchdown but had two first-half fumbles within the Raiders' 30 yard line and the Giants lost by a score of 17–24.[120] On December 5, Manning was renamed the starter.[121] On April 1, 2018, Smith signed a one-year contract with the Los Angeles Chargers.[122] During a Week 6 38–14 road victory over the Cleveland Browns, Smith made his Chargers debut, completing one pass for eight yards.[123] Overall, Smith appeared in five games in the 2018 season in relief roles.[124] Smith signed with the Seattle Seahawks on May 15, 2019.[125] Smith competed with Paxton Lynch for the backup job behind Russell Wilson. He was released on August 31, 2019, along with Lynch, but was re-signed the next day, earning the backup job.[126][127] Smith saw no action during his first season with the team. Smith re-signed with the Seahawks on May 20, 2020.[128] His only appearance came during a Week 14 40–3 victory over his former team, the Jets, as he played out the final 16:26 of the game. Smith completed four of five passes for 33 yards, leading the Seahawks to a field goal on the second of his two drives.[129] Smith re-signed with the Seahawks for a third season on April 22, 2021.[130] He made his first appearance of the 2021 season in Week 5 against the Rams after Russell Wilson left the game with a finger injury. Smith finished the 26–17 home loss with 131 passing yards, a touchdown (which was his first since 2017), and an interception.[131] Smith was announced the starter after Wilson was placed on injured reserve. In the next game against the Steelers, Smith threw for 209 yards and a touchdown, but lost a fumble in overtime in the 20–23 overtime road loss.[132] Two weeks later, against the Jaguars, Smith finished with 195 yards and two touchdowns to go along with two carries for eight yards and a touchdown.[133] Smith finished the 2021 season with 702 passing yards, five touchdowns, and an interception to go along with nine carries for 42 yards and a touchdown in four games and three starts.[134] The Seahawks re-signed Smith on April 19, 2022,[135] but the NFL disapproved Smith's new contract that same day after conducting the league's mandatory review; the issue was eventually resolved.[136] On August 26, 2022, Smith was announced as the starting quarterback for the season-opener against the Broncos, the team that former Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson had been traded to during the offseason.[137] Smith had competed for the starting quarterback spot with Drew Lock after the Seahawks traded Wilson.

During the game, Smith became the Seahawks’ single-season passing leader, surpassing Russell Wilson's mark of 4,219 yards set back in 2016.[144] With the win and the Packers' loss to the Lions later that night, the Seahawks clinched a playoff berth as the seventh seed, marking Smith's first playoff appearance.[145] Smith finished the regular season with numerous career highs, completing 399 of 572 passes, with a league-leading 69.8% completion percentage, for 4,282 yards, 30 touchdowns, 11 interceptions, and a 100.9 passer rating in 17 games to go along with 68 carries for 366 yards and a touchdown.[146] He was also the only quarterback to take every offensive snap for his team that season.[147] Smith was named Comeback Player of the Year by the Associated Press and the Pro Football Writers of America (PFWA).[148][149] In addition, the PFWA named him as their Most Improved Player.[150] The Seahawks traveled to San Francisco to face the San Francisco 49ers in the Wild Card Round, Smith's first career postseason start.

                "content": "Editions: En/lifestyle/celebrity-net-worth How the Seahawks QB's comeback season changed everything Geno Smith, the Seattle Seahawks' star quarterback, has become one of the most inspiring comeback stories in the NFL. Smith's career trajectory wasn't always promising. Drafted by the New York Jets in 2013, he initially signed a four-year, $5 million contract, including a $2 million signing bonus. However, struggles on the field and injuries led to a six-year stretch as a journeyman backup quarterback. During this period, he signed modest one-year deals with teams like the New York Giants and Los Angeles Chargers, earning between $895,000 and $1.2 million annually. Smith's fortunes changed dramatically when he joined the Seahawks in 2019. Though initially a backup, he seized the starting role in 2022 and delivered a career-defining season. That year, he led the NFL in completion percentage (69.8%), threw for 4,282 yards and 30 touchdowns, and broke multiple Seahawks franchise records. His performance earned him the NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award and his first Pro Bowl selection. \"Geno Smith has shown what resilience and hard work can achieve,\" said Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll in a 2022 interview. \"He's a leader, and his commitment to improvement is unparalleled.\" Related: Smith's on-field success translated into financial rewards. In March 2023, he inked a three-year, $75 million contract, including a $25 million signing bonus. This deal averages $25 million per year, with his 2024 salary climbing to $27 million due to performance incentives and bonuses. His net worth is estimated at $30 million, largely thanks to his current $27 million annual salary, a testament to his perseverance and talent. By the end of his current deal, Smith will have earned over $90 million from NFL contracts alone, with nearly $30 million coming from signing bonuses. Despite his financial success, Smith has remained relatively low-key, with no major endorsements or publicized investments. His story serves as a reminder of the value of persistence. \"I never stopped believing in myself,\" Smith shared after his 2022 breakout season. \"No matter how tough it got, I stayed ready for the opportunity.\" Now, as one of the highest-paid quarterbacks, Smith is living proof that patience and hard work pay off-in both legacy and wealth. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U.

                "content": "DeSean William Jackson (born December 1, 1986) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the California Golden Bears, where he was recognized as a two-time, first-team All-American in 2006 and 2007. He was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles in the second round of the 2008 NFL draft, and also played for the Washington Redskins, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Los Angeles Rams, and Baltimore Ravens. Jackson was selected to the Pro Bowl three times, and was the first player selected to the Pro Bowl at two different positions in the same year when he was named to the 2010 Pro Bowl as a wide receiver and return specialist. Jackson was born in Los Angeles, and grew up in the Crenshaw neighborhood of Los Angeles of the city.[1] Jackson is the son of Bill and Gayle Jackson, and his oldest brother, Byron, is a former San Jose State wide receiver who spent two seasons on the Kansas City Chiefs' practice squad. His father was hospitalized with pancreatic cancer during the Eagles run in the 2009 playoffs, and died on May 14, 2009.[2] He attended Long Beach Polytechnic High School, the same high school as future Philadelphia Eagles teammate Winston Justice and many other current NFL players. He became one of the top wide receiver recruits in the nation, with many collegiate football programs pursuing his services. He was named the 2004 Glenn Davis Award winner by the Los Angeles Times as Southern California's player of the year.[3] He also ran track and played baseball and was scouted by both the Tampa Bay Rays and Philadelphia Phillies in his senior year.[4] In track, he was timed at 10.5 seconds in the 100 meters. Jackson caught 60 passes for 1,075 yards for 15 touchdowns his senior year, leading the Jackrabbits to a CIF Southern Section championship.[5] He was pressed into service last minute as a defensive back in the section title game against Los Alamitos High School, responding with two interceptions, one which he returned 68 yards for a touchdown to help fuel Long Beach Poly's 21–6 victory. To cap off his high school career, Jackson was voted the Most Valuable Player at the U.S. Army All-American Bowl in San Antonio, where he caught seven passes for 141 yards and passed for a 45-yard touchdown in leading the West to a 35–3 victory in a game that featured 80 of the nation's top players.[6] However, he was also involved in an embarrassing play when he attempted to somersault from the five-yard line for a touchdown, but landed on the one-yard line, leaving the football there. ESPN.com's Tom Lemming rated him as the number four wide receiver in the country, PrepStar Magazine named him an All-American and a member of its Dream Team Top 100 players, and Calhisports.com voted him the 2004 Mr. Football State Player of the Year. He committed to the football program at the University of California, Berkeley under Coach Jeff Tedford, making his announcement on Southern California's FSN West. Jackson waited until the deadline to choose between scholarship offers for California and the University of Southern California.[7] Jackson attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he played for the California Golden Bears football team from 2005 to 2007.[8] Wearing the number 1, in his first collegiate game against Sacramento State in 2005, he scored both an offensive and special teams touchdown, returning a punt 49 yards for a score.[9] Throughout his freshman season, Jackson picked up 38 receptions for 601 yards along with seven touchdowns, eclipsing the 100-yard mark three times. In the 2005 Las Vegas Bowl game against BYU, Jackson tallied 130 yards and two scores.[10] Jackson was also expected to play for Cal's baseball team but, due to the success of his freshman football season, he chose to focus exclusively on football.[4] Coming into his sophomore year with high expectations, Jackson displayed more of his talent and playmaking ability, tallying 1,060 receiving yards and nine touchdowns. Jackson also returned four punts for touchdowns. He earned first-team All-Pac-10 honors as both a punt returner and a wide receiver. Jackson garnered national recognition with selections to first-team All-America by the Associated Press, Walter Camp Football Foundation, the Football Writers Association of America, the Sporting News, and Rivals.com as a punt returner. Jackson also captured the inaugural Randy Moss Award as the top returner in the nation. In one of only two California losses in Pac-10 play, Jackson had a 95-yard punt return for a touchdown against Arizona.[7] Jackson entered his junior season being considered a Heisman Trophy candidate. His season began promisingly, with a 77-yard punt return for a touchdown against Tennessee in the opening game of the season.[7] Against eleventh-ranked Oregon, he caught 11 passes for 161 yards and two touchdowns to lead the Bears to their first victory in Autzen Stadium since 1987.[11] Jackson finished the 2007 season with 65 catches for 762 yards, and scored six touchdowns as a receiver. Jackson was named an All-American as a return specialist.[7] Jackson suffered several minor injuries that limited his effectiveness at times during the season, along with a right thigh injury that forced him to miss most of the game against Washington and the Big Game against Stanford.[12][13] He also missed the first quarter of the 2007 Armed Forces Bowl for violating undisclosed team rules.[14] Jackson left Cal following the 2007 season and declared for the 2008 NFL draft. He departed holding Pac-10 records for punts returned for a touchdown both in a season (four) and in a career (six). Jackson ranks third all-time at California for receiving yards with 2,423 and receiving touchdowns with 22. He is sixth in receptions (162). Jackson finished with 52 career plays of 20 yards or more, making up 23 percent of his 226 touches.[7] Going to the 2008 NFL draft, Jackson was considered one of the top 10 wide receivers available in a draft class with many talented wide outs.[17] The only knock on Jackson was his small frame, being measured at 5'9¾ \" and just over 170 pounds. During the pre-draft period, Hall of Fame wide receiver Jerry Rice was quoted saying that Jackson \"has all the talent in the world. There's no reason he can't be everything he wants to be at the next level.\"[18] At the 2008 NFL Combine, Jackson had an impressive showing, running an official 4.35 40-yard dash.[17] He performed well in positional drills, running routes fluidly, and catching passes very well displaying his well-known agility and quickness. He also posted a standing broad jump of 10 feet. On April 26, 2008, Jackson was selected in the second round (49th overall) of the 2008 NFL draft by the Philadelphia Eagles. He was the seventh wide receiver taken, the first time no wide receivers were drafted in the first round.[19] On July 20, he agreed to terms on a four-year contract with the team. Jackson had a good preseason performance, which included a 76-yard punt return for a touchdown against the New England Patriots in the third preseason game. After the Eagles' roster was cut to its maximum 53-man limit for the season, he was listed as the starting punt returner and as a second-string wide receiver. Due to injuries sustained by Kevin Curtis and Reggie Brown, Jackson was the first rookie to start opening day for head coach Andy Reid.[20] On September 7, Jackson collected six catches for 106 yards in a 38–3 win over the St. Louis Rams. He also returned eight punts for a total of 97 yards, including a 60-yard punt return to set up a field goal. He had over 200 all-purpose yards, a record for a rookie wide receiver.[21] During a Monday Night Football game against the Dallas Cowboys on September 15, Jackson celebrated prematurely before running into the end zone by flipping the football behind him at the one-yard line. This led to what would have otherwise been his first NFL touchdown to be challenged and overturned, with Brian Westbrook running in for a touchdown from the one-yard line on the next play.[22] The Eagles lost the game to Dallas 41–37. Jackson finished the game with 110 yards on six receptions, becoming the only receiver in NFL history to have over 100 yards receiving in each of his first two games besides the Eagles' Don Looney in 1940. On September 28, Jackson recorded his first offensive touchdown against the Chicago Bears.[23] During this game, he also fumbled a punt return that set up the Bears' go ahead score.[24] The following week against the Washington Redskins on October 5, Jackson returned his first punt return for a touchdown 68 yards. Jackson scored his first rushing touchdown on November 9 on a direct snap in the wildcat formation with a nine-yard run against the New York Giants.[25] A rematch against the Giants on December 7 which resulted in a 20–14 upset of the defending Super Bowl champions marked the first time in the season that Jackson did not have a reception. The following week, Jackson rebounded, recording 77 yards on five catches in a 30–10 victory over the Cleveland Browns.[26] In the playoffs, Jackson recorded just 1 catch for 34 yards in the Eagles' wildcard victory over Minnesota, and four catches for 81 yards in a win over the New York Giants.[27][28] Jackson's final touchdown of the season came in the NFC Championship game on January 18, 2009, against the Arizona Cardinals, when he managed to haul in a 62-yard touchdown to cap a six-catch, 92-yard game.[29] Jackson narrowly finished second to Curtis in postseason receiving yards with 207 to Curtis's 211. Jackson finished a successful rookie season with two receiving touchdowns and a team-leading 62 receptions (the most by an Eagles rookie wide-receiver, second only to tight end Keith Jackson's 81 in 1988, and joining Jackson and Don Looney as the only Eagles to lead the team in receptions their rookie seasons).[30] His 912 receiving yards surpassed Keith Jackson's rookie record of 869.[31] He also led the NFL with 50 punt returns (an Eagles' rookie record and 3rd all time) for 440 yards (third in the NFL, fifth ever by an Eagle, and an Eagles' rookie record). In Week 1 against the Carolina Panthers, Jackson had his second punt return for an 85-yard touchdown, the second longest in Eagles history.[32] The following week, Kevin Kolb threw his first career touchdown pass to Jackson against the New Orleans Saints for 71 yards.[33] Jackson had 149 receiving yards against the Kansas City Chiefs on September 27 which included a 64-yard touchdown reception.[34] Against the Oakland Raiders on October 17 he caught six receptions for 94 yards, including a 51-yard diving fingertips catch, in a 13–9 loss.[35] Jackson caught a 57-yard touchdown pass from Donovan McNabb that gave McNabb his 200th career touchdown and 30,000th career passing yards on October 26 against the Washington Redskins on Monday Night Football. He also scored his first rushing touchdown of the season on a 67-yard reverse. Jackson injured his right foot during the game and had an x-ray during halftime, but returned to play during the third quarter. He was later named the NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his efforts.[36] In a Week 11 matchup on Sunday Night Football against the Chicago Bears, Jackson caught eight passes for 107 yards and a touchdown as the Eagles won a close game, 24–20. On November 29 against the Redskins, Jackson had to leave the game after sustaining a concussion after a helmet-to-helmet hit by linebacker London Fletcher.[37] Jackson recorded two receptions, including a 35-yard touchdown. Jackson missed the next game due to his concussion, but returned on December 13 against the New York Giants. Jackson had a career day, as he caught six passes for 178 yards including a 60-yard touchdown pass from McNabb and a 72-yard punt return for a touchdown (combined for 261 all purpose yards). The game would also put him at eight touchdowns of over 50 yards in a single season, tying an NFL record shared only by Elroy \"Crazylegs\" Hirsch[38] and Devin Hester. For his performance against the Giants, Jackson was named NFC Special Teams Player of the Week.[39] The following week against the San Francisco 49ers, Jackson went over the 1,000-yard mark for the season with 140 receiving yards, including a 19-yard touchdown reception as the Eagles clinched a playoff berth.[40] On December 27, he had four catches for 33 yards and a two-yard touchdown, his shortest touchdown of the season, in a win against the Denver Broncos.[41] Jackson was nearly shut down by the Dallas Cowboys in the regular season finale, with only two passes for 36 yards in a 24–0 rout of the Eagles.[42] In a rematch the following week on January 3, 2010, against the Cowboys in the NFC Wild Card Game, he was held by Dallas to three catches for 14 yards, including a six-yard touchdown pass in the 34–14 loss.[43] Jackson ended the season as the Eagles' leading receiver with 1,167 yards.[44] He was selected to the 2010 Pro Bowl as a starting wide receiver and a kick returner, the first time in Pro Bowl history that a player was selected at two different positions.[45][46] At the Pro Bowl, Jackson caught six passes for a team-high 101 yards and two touchdowns, including a 58-yard catch-and-run touchdown pass from McNabb. He was selected to the Sporting News' All-Pro team as a punt returner for the 2009 season, averaging 15.2 yards per punt return in 2009 as the league leader. After skipping voluntary camp in the spring, Jackson reported to training camp earlier than most veterans. However, he was not speaking to the media and was said to be frustrated about how the Eagles were unwilling to negotiate a contract extension with him.[47] Jackson was carted off the field after he suffered a back injury during the second full team workout of training camp on July 31, but the injury was not serious.[48] In a 35–32 victory over the Detroit Lions, Jackson had 135 receiving yards and a 45-yard catch-and-run touchdown pass.[49] The following week against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Jackson caught a 61-yard touchdown and finished the game with five receptions for 153 yards.[50] However, on October 3 and 10, Jackson caught only five passes for 43 total yards. He scored a pair of touchdowns on October 17 against the Atlanta Falcons, one on a 31-yard run and the second on a 34-yard reception from Kevin Kolb.[51] During the game, he sustained a severe concussion after a collision with Atlanta cornerback Dunta Robinson, with both players assisted from the field.[52] Jackson returned to play on November 7 against the Indianapolis Colts. On November 15, after an altercation with LaRon Landry, Jackson caught a then career long 88-yard touchdown pass from Michael Vick on the first play from scrimmage while Landry was covering him in 59–28 a Monday Night Football victory against the Washington Redskins.[53] He surpassed this on December 12 when he had a 91-yard touchdown against the Dallas Cowboys and also finished the game with a personal best 210 receiving yards.[54] Jackson again ended the regular season as the team's leading receiver with 1,056 yards.[55] He was ranked 29th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2011.[56] On December 19, 2010, Jackson returned a punt 65 yards for a touchdown to lead the Eagles to a win against the New York Giants in the final 14 seconds of the game. The Eagles had trailed 31–10 with under eight minutes to play but had come back with three unanswered touchdowns. With 14 seconds left, the game was tied at 31–31 and Jackson received the punt. He fumbled at first, but then picked it up and ran 65 yards for the score, running parallel to the goal line when he reached it in order to run out the clock.[57] This punt return is the first and only game-winning punt return on the final play from scrimmage in the history of the NFL.[58] On July 28, 2011, Jackson failed to report to Eagles' training camp at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, as required in his contract. His agent, Drew Rosenhaus, offered no immediate explanation for his absence. Jackson faced fines of $30,000-a-day until he reported to camp.[59] His deadline to report was August 9 or he would have lost a year of service time toward free agency. Jackson's holdout ended on August 8 when he reported to training camp.[60] On November 13, in a game against the Arizona Cardinals, Jackson was deactivated for missing a special teams meeting.[61] The following week in a matchup against the New York Giants, Jackson flipped the ball at New York defensive coordinator Perry Fewell after making a 50-yard reception and was flagged for taunting, drawing a $10,000 fine for unsportsmanlike conduct.[62] In a November 27 loss to the New England Patriots, he was benched for the entire fourth quarter after a performance that included drops of two potential touchdown passes.[63] Jackson ended the season as the Eagles' leading receiver with 961 yards. He also had the lowest total punt return yards of his career with 114 and did not return a punt for a touchdown during the 2011 season.[64] He was ranked 71st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2012.[65] Jackson received the Eagles' franchise tag on March 1, 2012.[66] He was re-signed to a five-year contract worth up to $51 million on March 14.[67] He had more than 100 yards receiving against Baltimore and New Orleans before fracturing his ribs in Week 12 against the Carolina Panthers.[68] In 11 games, he had 45 receptions for 700 yards; his 77-yard touchdown catch against New Orleans was the longest by an Eagles player that season.[69] Jackson began the 2013 season with 104 yards against Washington, and followed this with a then-career-best nine receptions for 193 yards against San Diego.[70][71] After a 132-yard game 5 (for which he won offensive player-of-the-week honors), he had his first career multiple-receiving-touchdown game against Tampa Bay. In week 14 against Minnesota, he again set a new career mark of 10 receptions for a career-second-best 195 yards.[72] On the year, he led the team with 82 receptions for 1,332 yards (4th and 2nd most by an Eagle in a season).[73] Though this was statistically the best season of his career, and led to his third Pro Bowl selection, Jackson was released by the Eagles on March 28, 2014.[74][75] He left the Eagles with the franchise's 4th most receiving yards (6,117), 8th most receptions (356), 9th most receiving touchdowns (32), and tied for the 3rd most 100+ receiving-yard games (20). He was ranked 63rd by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2014.[76] On April 2, 2014, Jackson signed with the Washington Redskins to a reported three-year, $24 million contract with $16 million guaranteed.[77] On September 14, 2014, Jackson suffered a bruised left shoulder against the Jacksonville Jaguars and was forced to leave the game in the first half.[78] Despite the injury, he would play the following week against Eagles in his return to Philadelphia, where he caught an 81-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Kirk Cousins.[79] The jersey that Jackson wore in that game would be featured at the Pro Football Hall of Fame after he became the third player in NFL history to record an 80-yard touchdown both for and against a team.[80] On October 17, 2014, Jackson was fined $16,537 for a horse-collar tackle on Arizona Cardinals safety Rashad Johnson in Week 6.[81] Jackson broke 100-yards receiving in six games that season, and ended with 56 receptions for a team-leading 1,169 and six touchdowns, and led the NFL for the second time in his career with 20.9 yards per catch.[82] He was ranked 50th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2015.[83] On August 6, Jackson suffered a shoulder injury that kept him sidelined for most of pre-season training, and then injured a hamstring in the first quarter of the season opener against Miami.[84] Jackson did not return until November 8, and even then saw limited duty over the remaining 10 games of the season. While injured, Jackson's home in Tarzana, California, was reportedly attacked and violently defended by guests while he was away.[85] On December 20, Jackson caught a 77-yard touchdown pass from Cousins as part of his only 100 yard game of the season (6 catches for 153 yards).[86] The next week, Jackson was booed by the Philadelphia crowd as he contributed to the Redskins' 38–24 division-clinching victory. He ended the season with 30 catches for 528 yards (career lows) and 4 touchdowns.[87] Jackson appeared to return to form with 6 catches for 102 yards in a season-opening loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers.[88] He caught at least one pass in each of the 16 games that season, though production was lower during the season's middle. In Week 4, he was fined for wearing police caution tape on his shoes to protest the role of race in the American criminal justice system.[89] He went over 100 yards in four-out-of-five games late in the season, including 3 catches for 102 yards, and a go-ahead 80-yard touchdown on December 11 against his former team in Philadelphia.[90] Following a 7-reception, 111-yard effort the next week, Jackson was fined a second time in the season for the color of his cleats.[89][91] Both he and teammate Pierre Garçon reached 1,000 yards receiving in a season-finale loss to the Giants, becoming the first Redskins tandem since 1999 to achieve this feat, and also becoming the 7th and 8th Redskins in history with multiple 1,000 yard receiving seasons.[92] He ended the year with 56 receptions for 1,005 yards and 4 touchdowns, leading the NFL for the third time with 17.9 yards per catch.[93] On March 9, 2017, Jackson signed a three-year, $33.5 million contract with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.[94] On September 24, Jackson caught his first touchdown as a Buccaneer against the Minnesota Vikings.[95] On October 5, Jackson caught five passes for 106 yards in a 19–14 loss against the New England Patriots.[96] Overall, in the 2017 season, he recorded 50 receptions for 668 receiving yards and three receiving touchdowns.[97] On September 9, 2018, Jackson caught five passes for 146 yards and two touchdowns in the season-opening 48–40 win over defending NFC South champions New Orleans Saints.[98] The performance was his second career game with two receiving touchdowns (58 and 36 yards), despite leaving the game with a concussion.[99] His 58-yard touchdown reception was his 27th-career touchdown over 50 yards, which tied him for third most in NFL history, behind Randy Moss (29) and Jerry Rice (37).[100] He also surpassed 100 yards in Week 2 against the Philadelphia Eagles (129 yards and a touchdown) and Week 4 against the Chicago Bears (112 yards), to enter Tampa Bay's bye-week seventh in the NFL in receiving yards and first in yards-per-reception at 24.9.[101][102] His output significantly declined from this point, however. Over the next seven games, he averaged three receptions for 47 yards per game, and had only one touchdown reception (though he added a rushing touchdown in Week 7 against the Cleveland Browns), before an Achilles tendon injury sidelined him for all but one reception over the last five weeks of the season.[103] The one receiving touchdown, a 60-yard reception in Week 8 against the Cincinnati Bengals, was Jackson's record-setting 24th NFL receiving touchdown of 60 yards or more, breaking a tie with Jerry Rice. The record came a week after Jackson became the 47th NFL player to reach 10,000 receiving yards.[104] The 32-year-old Jackson ended the 2018 season with enough receptions (41 for 774 yards) to qualify as the league-leader in yards-per-reception (18.9) for the fourth time in his career.[105][106] On March 13, 2019, Jackson and a 2020 seventh-round selection were traded to the Eagles in exchange for a 2019 sixth-round compensatory selection (Pick #208, used to draft Scotty Miller).[107] Jackson made his return to the Eagles in Week 1 against another former team, the Washington Redskins. In the game, Jackson caught eight passes for 154 yards and two touchdowns (his third and final multiple touchdown game) as the Eagles won 32–27.[108] Both touchdowns were long, putting him at 31 career touchdowns receptions over 50 yards, passing Randy Moss (29) for second in NFL history. He underwent core muscle surgery on November 5,[109] and was subsequently placed on injured reserve.[110] In the first three weeks of the 2020 season, Jackson caught 10 passes for 121 yards before missing the next three games due to a hamstring injury.[111] He returned in Week 7, but suffered a lower body injury in the game and was placed on injured reserve on October 26, 2020.[112] He was activated on December 26, 2020.[113] In Week 16 against the Dallas Cowboys, Jackson caught an 81-yard touchdown pass from Jalen Hurts during the 37–17 loss. The touchdown was his record-extending 25th of 60 or more yards and his record-tying 5th of 80 or more yards, joining Jerry Rice, Lance Alworth, Bob Hayes and Derrick Alexander.[114] He finished the 2020 season with 14 receptions for 236 receiving yards and one receiving touchdown in five games.[115] Jackson was released on February 19, 2021.[116] Jackson signed with the Los Angeles Rams on March 21, 2021.[117] Jackson recorded his first touchdown with the Rams in their Week 3 win against the Buccaneers, on a 75-yard pass from Matthew Stafford.[118] On November 2, Jackson was released by the Rams upon request.[119] With the Rams going on to win Super Bowl LVI, Jackson was awarded with a Super Bowl ring due to being on the active roster during the season.[120] On November 8, 2021, Jackson signed with the Las Vegas Raiders.[121] In Week 12, against the Dallas Cowboys, he had three receptions for 102 yards and a touchdown in the 36–33 victory.[122] In the 2021 season, Jackson had 20 receptions for 454 yards and two touchdowns.[123] On October 18, 2022, Jackson was signed to the Baltimore Ravens' practice squad, and became the oldest active receiver in the NFL.[124] He appeared for the first time in Week 9, and in Week 12 he caught a 62-yard pass to set up the go-ahead touchdown late in the 4th quarter against the Jacksonville Jaguars.[125] He was signed to the Ravens' active roster on December 5, 2022.[126] He was released on January 7, 2023.[127] On November 29, 2023, Jackson signed a one-day contract with the Philadelphia Eagles to officially retire as a member of the Eagles.[128] In 2024, Jackson was hired as the offensive coordinator for Woodrow Wilson Classical High School.[129] Jackson currently resides in Moorestown, New Jersey. Jackson was featured on the cover of the PlayStation 2 version of NCAA Football 09.[130] Jackson took part and won a competition of Hole in the Wall in April 2011.[131] Jackson has also received media attention for plays that critics say show poor judgement on his part, and in particular, multiple premature celebrations which have resulted in lost touchdowns.[132] In the movie Silver Linings Playbook, an otherwise-conservative psychotherapist encourages the protagonist (played by Bradley Cooper) to wear Jackson's jersey.[133] In July 2020, Jackson posted an Instagram story featuring a quote falsely attributed to Adolf Hitler, espousing Black Hebrew Israelite ideology, that read: \"because the white Jews knows [sic] that the Negroes are the real Children of Israel and to keep Americas [sic] secret the Jews will blackmail America. They will extort America, their plan for world domination won't work if the Negroes know who they were [sic].\" The post also read \"Hitler was right.\"[134][135][136] Jackson posted several quotes from Louis Farrakhan on his Instagram account in which Farrakhan accused Dr. Anthony Fauci and Bill Gates of desiring to \"depopulate the Earth\" with a COVID-19 vaccine.[137] Farrakhan has been labeled an antisemitic extremist by the Southern Poverty Law Center.[138][139] Jackson later deleted the posts in question and apologized for his statements.[137] After the incident, Jackson spoke with leading Philadelphia Jews including Rabbi Doniel Grodnitzky of Chabad Young Philly, Philadelphia 76ers co-owner, Michael G. Rubin, and David J. Adelman, Chairman of the Philadelphia Holocaust Remembrance Foundation.[140] Jackson also talked with a Holocaust survivor Edward Mosberg and agreed to visit the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, a museum on the site of the Auschwitz concentration camp.[141]",

DeSean Jackson is reportedly set to become the new head coach at Delaware State, Jeff Lightsy Jr. of Victory Formation Media reported on Thursday. The three-time Pro Bowl wide receiver is the latest former pro to join the HBCU coaching ranks, joining recent Norfolk State hire Michael Vick. There has not yet been a formal announcement from Delaware State or Jackson; however, multiple outlets have confirmed the report. Jackson last played in the NFL in 2022, playing seven games for the Ravens. He signed a one-day contract with the Eagles in November 2023 in order to officially retire as a member of the Philadelphia organization. Here's all you need to know about Jackson's entrance into college football. NCAAF HQ: Live NCAAF scores | Updated NCAAF standings | Full NCAAF schedule With Jackson set to join Delaware State as its new head coach, he fulfills what reportedly has been a goal of his. According to ESPN's Pete Thamel, it has been a \"dream\" of Jackson to coach at an HBCU, and now that is becoming a reality. Despite a lack of head coaching experience, Jackson should offer Delaware State a bump in recruiting, being a college football legend and former NFL star. While Jackson grew up on the West Coast, he reached NFL stardom in Philadelphia with the Eagles, the closest NFL team to Dover, which is the home of Delaware State. Jackson joins a Delaware State program that struggled mightily under former head coach Lee Hull. In the two years under Hull, the Hornets combined for a record of 2-21, including a 2024 record of 1-11 and a last-place finish in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC). Jackson grew up in the Crenshaw neighborhood of Los Angeles, Calif. He attended Long Beach Polytechnic High School before enrolling at University of California, Berkeley, where he starred for the Golden Bears. The lone connection between Jackson and the Delaware area is from his NFL days. He played for the Eagles in nearby Philadelphia. The specifics of Jackson's contract have not yet been reported. This section will be updated as more details are disclosed. Jackson brings minimal coaching experience to Delaware State. After retiring from playing football in 2023, he spent the 2024 season as the offensive coordinator at Woodrow Wilson High School in Long Beach, Calif. Bryan Murphy joined The Sporting News in 2022 as the NHL/Canada content producer. Previously he worked for NBC Sports on their national news desk reporting on breaking news for the NFL, MLB, NBA and NHL, in addition to covering the 2020 and 2022 Olympic Games. A graduate of Quinnipiac University, he spent time in college as a beat reporter covering the men’s ice hockey team.",

                "content": "Editions: En/ncaa He is on the same path that Deion Sanders and Michael Vick Another one down this path and it is a good one. Former NFL star wide receiver DeSean Jackson is on the verge of fulfilling a long-held dream. Reports indicate that Jackson is finalizing an agreement to become the head coach at Delaware State University, a Historically Black College or University (HBCU) following Deion Sanders and onthers. This move marks a pivotal moment in Jackson's post-NFL career and highlights his commitment to giving back to the community and nurturing the next generation of athletes. Jackson, who retired from the NFL in 2023 after a remarkable 15-year career, has gradually transitioned into coaching. He recently served as an assistant coach at his alma mater, Woodrow Wilson High School in Long Beach, California. His on-campus interview at Delaware State was reportedly a success, paving the way for him to take on this new and challenging role. Related: Delaware State's decision to bring Jackson on board is part of a broader trend of former NFL players taking up coaching roles at HBCUs. This trend was notably popularized by Deion Sanders at Jackson State and Eddie George at Tennessee State. Jackson's potential move to Delaware State will place him in the same conference as another former NFL star, Michael Vick, who recently became the head coach at Norfolk State. For Delaware State, Jackson's hiring is a significant boost for a football program that has struggled in recent years. The Hornets have not had a winning season since 2012 and finished the 2024 season with a 1-11 record. Jackson's experience, leadership, and passion for the game could be the key to turning the program around and ushering in a new era of success. Jackson has always expressed a desire to coach at an HBCU, and this opportunity allows him to make a meaningful impact both on and off the field. His journey from standout wide receiver to head coach is a testament to his dedication to the sport and his commitment to empowering young athletes.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Former NFL All-Pro DeSean Jackson is nearing a deal to become the next coach at Delaware State, according to multiple reports. Jackson, an All-American wideout at Cal from 2005 to 2007, has expressed a desire to become a coach at an HBCU program, per ESPN. Delaware State plays in the FCS as part of the MEAC, one of the two big Division I HBCU conferences. The Hornets have struggled in recent years and only won one conference championship since 1991. Former coach Lee Hull was fired after going 2-21 in two seasons, and the last three coaches have combined for a 22-84 record. Jackson is just the latest NFL star to become a college football coach without any prior college experience at that level. Former Virginia Tech, Falcons and Eagles star Michael Vick agreed last week to take over at Norfolk State, only 30 minutes away from his hometown of Newport News, Virginia. Deion Sanders is arguably the most high-profile hire to join the college ranks without previous coaching experience at that level. Sanders led Jackson State to a 27-6 record in three seasons before taking over at Colorado. Tennessee State coach Eddie George also led his program to its first FCS playoffs appearance since 2013 in his fourth season. And though he is among the greatest coaches at any level, Bill Belichick recently became the coach at North Carolina despite not having any college coaching experience. Jackson retired from the NFL in November 2023 after 15 seasons and three All-Pro selections. He holds pro records for most career touchdowns of 60-plus (26) and 80-plus (5) yards while posting more than 11,000 yards receiving. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "content": "Editorial Intern Ravens fans got a Christmas gift as the Ravens demolished the Houston Texans, 31-2, Wednesday night in Houston. Lamar Jackson and Derrick Henry dominated as Baltimore played its most complete game of the season. With the win and Steelers' loss to the Chiefs earlier in the day, the Ravens now control their own destiny in the AFC North race. All Baltimore needs is a victory in Week 18 over the Browns or a Steelers loss to the Bengals. Here's how the Ravens came away with the Christmas victory: Moments after a Texans safety injected life into the Houston crowd, the Texans were threatening again deep inside Baltimore territory. The Ravens defense held strong, however, and on fourth-and-goal as Ar'Darius Washington walloped Texans running back Joe Mixon near the pylon for a turnover on downs. Then the Ravens went 99 yards on six plays, highlighted by a 67-yard catch and run from Mark Andrews and an unreal touchdown pass from Jackson to Isaiah Likely. The sequence gave the Ravens a 17-2 lead heading into halftime. Right after Beyoncé performed, the show continued for the Ravens. Leading by 15, Kyle Hamilton opened the second half with his first interception of the season, and Jackson took it from there. On Baltimore's second play of the drive, Jackson faked a handoff to Derrick Henry and broke free for a 48-yard touchdown thanks to strong blocks from Andrews and Likely. Offensive Stats Defensive Stats Team Stats S Kyle Hamilton Hamilton might petition to play every Christmas. After hauling in two interceptions on Dec. 25 last season, Hamilton got his first interception of the season against the Texans. Hamilton continues to elevate the defense since his switch to more of a traditional deep safety role. RB Derrick Henry The Ravens rode Henry to start the game, and the Texans couldn't stop him. Henry had 10 carries for 86 rushing yards and a touchdown in the first quarter as Baltimore got out to a quick 10-0 lead. Henry finished the game with 27 rushes for 147 yards and a score. QB Lamar Jackson Jackson continues to make a case for his third MVP. He finished Wednesday's game with 168 passing yards 87 rushing yards, scoring three total touchdowns as he passed Michael Vick for the most career rushing yards for a quarterback in NFL history. He made a couple ridiculous plays, like his touchdown pass to Likely, where he held the ball for more than eight seconds, and his 48-yard run. Ravens Defense The Baltimore defense had its best game of the season, pitching a shutout on the road. The Texans had just 10 first downs and 211 total yards in the loss while five different Ravens had sacks. Since Week 11, the Ravens defense has turned into a strength after having a difficult start to the season. The Ravens return to M&T Bank Stadium for their regular-season finale against the Cleveland Browns (3-12) on either Jan. 4 (Sat.) or Jan. 5 (Sun.). The Ravens fell to the Browns in Week 8, but since then quarterback Jameis Winston has been benched for Dorian Thompson-Robinson. A Ravens win clinches back-to-back AFC North titles. Lamar Jackson's 47-yard spin touchdown against the Bengals in 2019 announced that Jackson was a special running quarterback. The Ravens have a one-game lead over the Steelers in AFC North heading into the final week. The Ravens got elite grades in their 31-2 win over the Houston Texans. Here's what the Texans said after falling to the Ravens, 31-2. Zach Orr couldn't contain his excitement after Baltimore's goal line stand. Pundits believe Lamar Jackson may have flipped some MVP voters with performance vs. Houston. Defense continues its stellar improvement. Baltimore's defense came up with a fourth-down goal-line stop, an interception, and five sacks against the Texans. Ravens QB Lamar Jackson is now the most accomplished rushing quarterback in NFL history. Mark Andrews scored a touchdown in his fifth consecutive game, sparking a donation from McAfee. The Ravens are one win away from clinching the AFC North. Lamar Jackson is putting a different spin on spectacular. Baltimore's defense is peaking when it matters most. Lamar Jackson had a wholesome exchange with a young Ravens fan in Houston, and seemingly handed a chain to Eric DeCosta. Copyright © 2024 Baltimore Ravens. All Rights Reserved.",

                "title": "Ravens vs. Texans score, takeaways: Lamar Jackson makes MVP statement in Christmas beatdown of Houston - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Baltimore Ravens have taken over first place in the AFC North, and Lamar Jackson made his statement for his third MVP award in a Christmas Day blowout of the Houston Texans. Jackson threw for 168 yards and two touchdowns while rushing for 87 yards -- and passing Michael Vick for the most rushing yards by a quarterback in NFL history -- in the blowout victory. Jackson passed Vick on a 6-yard run with 7:16 remaining in the third quarter to give him 6,110 rushing yards in his career, passing Vick's mark of 6,109. He had 87 of his yards on just four carries and amassed 73 yards on his first two carries -- including a 48-yard touchdown run in the third quarter that put him within striking distance of Vick. Derrick Henry rushed for 147 yards as the Ravens finished with 251 rushing yards in the win. The Ravens defense also didn't allow a point, as the Texans' points came off a safety in the second quarter. C.J. Stroud finished 17 of 31 for 185 yards and an interception. Baltimore needs a win in Week 18 to wrap up the AFC North and the No. 3 seed in the playoffs. Houston appears locked into the No. 4 seed in the AFC with the loss, needing a lot to happen to improve its playoff standing. Takeaways and a recap of this Christmas Day blowout can be found in the live blog below. The Ravens were just better than the Texans in every facet of this game, but the biggest discrepancy ended up being the rushing totals. Baltimore set the tone on the first possession by rushing for 51 yards on an eight-play, 75-yard touchdown drive to kick off the game -- and never relented. Baltimore had 115 rushing yards to Houston's eight after the first quarter, and the Ravens finished with 228 rushing yards to the Texans' 45. Henry had 143 rushing yards and Jackson had 87 on four carries. Just the Ravens doing what they do very well. The Texans are just not on the same level as the Ravens, and were underwhelming in a lot of areas. The defense allowed the Ravens to average 7.7 yards per play and 6.5 yards per carry when the starters were in. The Ravens also scored touchdowns on four of their nine possessions when the starters were in. Stroud and the offense were shut out as well, with the only points coming via the defense (a safety). The Texans quarterback was inaccurate early in the game, which led to them getting into a hole. Houston was also 3 of 13 on third down and 0 of 2 on fourth down when the starters were in. Just a poor showing by the Texans. The Texans were facing a fourth-and-goal at the 4-yard line late in the second quarter, but failed to convert a touchdown and get back in the game. Stroud threw a pass underneath to Joe Mixon that only got three yards. The Texans turned the ball over on down, and that was the closest they got to scoring anything on offense. The Ravens responded with a six-play drive that went 99 yards, capped with a Jackson 9-yard touchdown pass to Isaiah Likely that was an MVP-type throw. Baltimore took a 17-2 lead, and the game felt out of reach at that point. The Texans needed a touchdown on that fourth-and-goal. There were plenty of plays from Jackson that could qualify for this list, but let's go with the Likely touchdown that put Baltimore up 17-2. Jackson took a read-option and rolled to his right, pump faked twice and saw nothing open, so he bought himself more time along the sideline. Jackson had Texans pass rusher Danielle Hunter on skates as he moved backwards and faked him out several times before pointing to Likely in the end zone. He fired to Likely in the middle of the field for the 9-yard touchdown that showcased why Jackson will likely win MVP. This was on the same day Jackson broke the rushing yardage record for quarterbacks. Just another amazing play for Jackson in a career full of them. The Ravens (11-5) close their regular season against the Browns, while the Texans (9-7) end their season against the Jaguars. Both teams are going to the playoffs. The Ravens are going to take over first in the AFC North. They'll clinch the division with a win or Steelers loss next week. Ravens 31, Texans 2 Jackson has 166 passing yards and 2 TD. He has 87 rushing yards on four carrie. The Ravens have 216 rushing yards. Give Lamar the MVP at this rate. Jackson has passed Michael Vick for the most rushing yards by a quarterback in NFL history. Jackson passed Vick on a 6-yard run with 7:16 remaining in the third quarter to give him 6,110 rushing yards in his career, passing Vick's mark of 6,109. C.J. Stroud throws an interception to Kyle Hamilton on the Texans first drive of the second half. On the first play of Baltimore's ensuing possession, Lamar Jackson runs for 48 yards and a score. Jackson is 13 yards away from passing Michael Vick for the most rushing yards ever by a QB. The Ravens are cruising. Enjoy your Christmas dinner. Ravens 24, Texans 2 Looks like Stroud has a leg injury. He'll get it looked at on the sidelines, but missed just one play. Great sign for the Texans. Ravens halted at midfield and Texans will punt. Houston gets ball to start the second half. Hard to see them try to score with 21 seconds left in the half. Texans go 3-and-out. Baltimore has just over a minute to get more points. All three timeouts left. Let's see what Lamar can do. At a loss of words for this Lamar Jackson TD pass to Isaiah Likely. Just an incredible QB. Watch and enjoy. Ravens 17, Texans 2 The reigning MVP doing MVP things. Lamar went to his left, eluded a sack, and threw past the right hashmark to Andrews for 67-yard reception. Andrews almost broke it and scored, but Ravens are inside the 10 at the 2:00 warning. Jackson is 4-of-6 for 110 yards. The Texans decide to go for it on 4th-and-goal at the 3, but Stroud's pass to Joe Mixon only gets one yard. Turnover on downs. Ar'Darius Washington with the stop as the Texans get nothing. Ravens still up 10-2 late in the 2nd Stroud's pass is high to Robert Woods on 4th-and-3 at the BAL 30, but certainly didn't think that warranted a PI call. That may have been a missed call by the officials. That looked like Humphrey was playing the football. Texans get a break. Derrick Henry was tackled in the end zone by Kamari Lassiter for a four-yard loss and a safety. Henry has lost 8 yards in his last 2 carries, but the Texans are on the board. The Texans get the ball back. The 70-yard punt by Tommy Townsend set that up. Ravens 10, Texans 2 Odofe Oweh sacks Stroud for a 13-yard loss. The sack was really bad since it was 3rd-and-2 from the Texans 45. This was easily 4-down territory prior to the sack. Just not a good start for Stroud. Houston held Derrick Henry to -4 yards, then Keaton Mitchell to -6 yards. Lamar Jackson had nothing on 3rd-and-20. The Ravens punt for the first time, but are still up 10-0. Down to 105 rushing yards now. Henry has 10 carries for 86 yards after the first quarter. The Ravens are ahead in rushing yards 115-8. They are up 10-0. Three straight misses for Stroud to end the drive. Stroud missed Dalton Schultz for an easy first down on 3rd-and-10, which would have been a huge gain. Texans put again down 10-0 to Ravens. Stroud is 3-of-6 for 30 yards to start. The Ravens had another impressive drive, but the biggest development was 52-yard Justin Tucker FG. Very encouraging sign for the Ravens, although we need to see Tucker hit that outdoors. Now 6-for-11 on kicks from 50+ this year. Ravens 10, Texans 0 -- Baltimore with 83 rushing yards Baltimore gets a sack on 3rd down. C.J. Stroud taken down by Kyle Van Noy on 3rd down and Houston will punt. The Ravens defense has come alive over the past month, allowing just 187.3 yards per game -- 1st in NFL. Derrick Henry scored on a 2-yard touchdown run on an easy 8-play, 75-yard TD drive for the Ravens. 51 rushing yards for the Ravens on the drive as Lamar Jackson had a 27-yard pass to Zay Flowers and a 25-yard run. Texans had 10-men on the field on the Henry TD. Ravens 7, Texans 0 The Texans are the 1st team ever to win back-to-back division titles with a QB-HC duo each in their 1st 2 NFL seasons -- C.J. Stroud and DeMeco Ryans. Ravens -- First place in AFC North (right now in first with Steelers loss) Texans -- No. 3 seed (would have conference-record tiebreaker over Steelers) A look at the Christmas Day jerseys: Santa Claus is coming to Houston. The Ravens enter the field in front of the Texans crowd. WR Nelson Agholor is among those out on Christmas Day The Texans are without C Juice Scruggs (foot) and G Nick Broeker against the Ravens defense. Good afternoon everyone and Merry Christmas! We got you covered for Ravens and Texans in Houston today. Perhaps maybe there will be some Beyonce halftime updates as well. Excited to watch Lamar Jackson again, and see how C.J. Stroud faces in his first matchup with the Ravens since the AFC Divisional Playoff loss last year. Should be a fun one! © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Houston recorded a safety with 10 minutes left in the second quarter, getting within eight points of Baltimore, but the Texans were held off the scoreboard for the rest of the game. The Ravens run game was on full display. Derrick Henry wasn't thrown off his game by being tackled in the end zone for the early safety, ending with 147 yards and a touchdown on 27 carries.

Derrick Henry carried the ball 27 times for 147 yards and a touchdown. The Ravens as a team ran 43 times for 251 yards. C.J. Stroud struggled for the Texans.

With the Pittsburgh Steelers losing earlier, the Ravens moved into first place in the AFC North and third place in the conference overall.

The Texans finish their regular season with a game against the Tennessee Titans. NBC News Rohan Nadkarni That’s all for the NFL on Christmas! The Ravens dominated the Texans in the late, shutting down their offense while Lamar Jackson made MVP-caliber play after MVP-caliber play. Baltimore is now in first place in the AFC North after today’s win. Rohan Nadkarni The Ravens are punting again, but more importantly for them they took over seven minutes off the clock with their 31-2 lead. The Texans’ offense us back on the field with 3:23 to go and Davis Mills is in for C.J. Stroud. Rohan Nadkarni Lamar Jackson has been taken out of the game with the Ravens leading 31-2. He’s already signing autographs for fans to give you an idea of how over this game is. Rohan Nadkarni ...And the Texans can’t do anything after the Ravens punt, going three-and-out and punting the ball right back. The Ravens will take over with 10:24 left in the fourth and presumably trying to run out the clock. Rohan Nadkarni The Ravens punted after eight plays. Don’t think they’re sweating it very hard with their 31-2 lead, though. Rohan Nadkarni The Ravens have dominated this game from the jump and they’ll take a big lead into the fourth quarter. Baltimore has been impressive on both sides of the ball, and Lamar Jackson has made play after play. The Ravens will have a 1st-and-10 on their own 23 when the fourth begins. Rohan Nadkarni After a sack on third down, C.J. Stroud threw too short of the sticks on 4th-and-7, only picking up six yards. It needed a replay to be overturned to the right call, but the Texans turned the ball over on downs. Their offense has been pitiful today. Stroud is under 200 yards on 29 attempts and he’s been sacked five times. The Ravens take over with a 31-2 lead with 2:15 left in the third quarter. Rohan Nadkarni With his four carries for 87 yards today, Lamar Jackson became the NFL’s all-time leading rusher for a quarterback, overtaking Michael Vick. Jackson is currently ahead of Vick by one yard, with 6,110 career rushing yards. Only 27, Jackson is in his seventh year with the Ravens. Rohan Nadkarni Lamar Jackson is making an MVP statement today. After a rushing touchdown on the Ravens’ last drive, Jackson found Mark Andrews from one yard out for his second touchdown pass of the game. Jackson is now up to 163 yards passing in addition 87 yards rushing and three total touchdowns. Baltimore is dominating and now leading 31-2. Saba Hamedy If you want to rewatch Beyoncé's Christmas halftime show, do it now. A replay will only be available for a few hours, Variety previously reported. In the U.S., both Christmas games will expire on Netflix three hours after the livestreams end, as per terms of the agreement between Netflix and the NFL. Meanwhile, outside the U.S., viewers have 24 hours after the livestream ends to catch the games (or performances). Rohan Nadkarni After C.J. Stroud was sacked on second down, he was pressured on 3rd-and-16 and forced to throw well short of the sticks. The Texans punted for the fifth time as their offense continues to struggle. The Ravens take over on their own 33 leading 24-2. Rohan Nadkarni Wow! Two plays after Kyle Hamilton’s interception, the Ravens are in the end zone. Lamar Jackson took a designed run 49 yards to the house for a score. Jackson now has 73 yards rushing on only two carries. Baltimore leads 24-2. Rohan Nadkarni The Texans’ first drive of the second half ends in disaster. On 3rd-and-3, C.J. Stroud threw into double coverage and was intercepted by Kyle Hamilton. The Ravens will now take over on the Houston 39 with a 17-2 lead. Rohan Nadkarni I’m not sure how the Ravens and Texans will follow up that Beyoncé performance, but they have no choice with the third quarter underway. C.J. Stroud and Houston are on the field first trailing 17-2. Doha Madani Beyoncé opened the show by entering NRG Stadium on horseback singing \"16 Carriages,\" dressed in all white with a \"Cowboy Carter\" sash. She dismounted in the tunnels of the stadium as she transitioned into her cover of The Beatles' \"Blackbird,\" which was also featured on the album. On the field, she changed outfits and upped the tempo with \"Ya-Ya.\" The stage set up was surrounded by performers in all white cowboy hats, chaps, boots and \"Cowboy Carter\" sashes. Shaboozey and Post Malone made appearances to sing their collaborations with her from the album, \"Sweet Honey Buckin\" and \"Levii's Jeans.\" Beyoncé ended the show dancing side-by-side with 12-year-old daughter Blue Ivy as she performed her hit single \"Texas Hold 'Em.\" Saba Hamedy Beyoncé was joined by several familiar faces during the show, including Tiera Kennedy, Tanner Adell, Brittney Spencer and Reyna Roberts. Doha Madani This is Texas and Beyoncé Knowles Carter effortlessly holds our attention. Beyoncé takes the stage at NRG Stadium, gracing her hometown of Houston with the first performances from her \"Coach Carter\" country album. Rohan Nadkarni The Ravens dominated the first half, taking a 17-2 lead into the break. After Baltimore ran all over the Texans in the first quarter, Lamar Jackson made some big plays in the second. Houston’s only score came via safety as C.J. Stroud has struggled. And now it’s time for Beyoncé! Rohan Nadkarni The Ravens couldn’t get over midfield on their final drive before halftime, as Lamar Jackson threw incomplete on 3rd-and-10 from his own 48. Baltimore punted, and the Texans have 21 seconds and three timeouts to maybe try something crazy. Rohan Nadkarni After two straight incomplete throws from C.J. Stroud with only two yards needed for a first down, the Texans punted on 4th-and-2 from the Baltimore 43. Not a sharp game from Stroud so far. The Ravens are up 17-2 with a chance to add to their lead before halftime. Rohan Nadkarni Beautiful drive by the Ravens, who needed only six plays to go 99 yards for their second touchdown of the game. Lamar Jackson made all kinds of plays, including a nice scramble-turned-pass to Mark Andrews for a 67-yard gain. Then Jackson extended a play for several seconds inside the 10 to find Isaiah Likely for a score. Baltimore now leads 17-2. Rohan Nadkarni The Texans went for it on 4th-and-3 and picked up a first down via a pass interference penalty on Marlon Humphrey. That was...a tough call. There was minimal contact by Humphrey, and even Netflix rules analyst Gene Steratore (a former ref) disagreed with the flag. The conversion set up Houston inside the Baltimore 5-yard line. Rohan Nadkarni Wow! The Ravens escape harm after the Texans converted a 4th-and-3 via penalty to get to the 10-yard line. After two runs and an incomplete pass, C.J. Stroud threw to Joe Mixon on 4th-and-goal, but Mixon was tackled one yard short of the end zone. That’s a massive stop by Baltimore, which was on defense after the offense gave up a safety. The Ravens will now take over on their own 1 hoping to avoid another one. Rohan Nadkarni Whoa! The Texans’ first points on Christmas come via their defense, as Derrick Henry was tackled in the end zone for a safety. After running for 86 yards on his first 10 carries, Henry has lost eight yards on his last two. Houston will now get possession of the ball trailing 10-2. Rohan Nadkarni On 3rd-and-2, C.J Stroud couldn’t run away from Odafe Oweh and was sacked for a 13-yard loss, leading to the Texans’ third straight punt. Stroud has now been sacked twice in the first half. The Ravens take over inside their own 5-yard line after the punt. Rohan Nadkarni After dominating on the ground in the first quarter, the Ravens’ first two runs of the second quarter both went backward. That set up a 3rd-and-20, and Lamar Jackson threw incomplete, setting up a Baltimore punt. The Texans take over on their own 18 trailing 10-0. Rohan Nadkarni The Ravens lead 10-0 after one quarter, and they’ve been especially dominant on the ground. Derrick Henry has already carried the ball 10 times for 86 yards, as well as the game’s only touchdown. Overall, Baltimore rushed 13 times for 115 yards in the first quarter. It will be a long day for the Texans if they can’t slow down the run. Rohan Nadkarni The Texans picked up a first down on the first play of their second drive, but C.J. Stroud threw incomplete on the next three plays, leading to a punt. Stroud missed a wide-open Dalton Schultz on third down on what could have potentially been a big gain. The Ravens take over their own 23 with a 10-0 lead after a penalty on the punt. Rohan Nadkarni After a nice run stuff by the Texans on second down, Lamar Jackson threw incomplete to Zay Flowers on 3rd-and-9, leading to a Justin Tucker field-goal attempt. Tucker was good from 52 yards out, giving the Ravens a 10-0 lead with 2:47 left in the first quarter. Rohan Nadkarni On 3rd-and-4 from the Baltimore 48, C.J. Stroud was sacked by Kyle Van Noy, ending the Texans’ first drive after only six plays. The Ravens take over on their own 30 leading 7-0. Rohan Nadkarni What an opening drive by the Ravens. Baltimore went 75 yards in eight plays, picking up 51 of those yards on the ground. Derrick Henry capped the drive with a two-yard touchdown run. The Ravens lead 7-0. Saba Hamedy It's been smooth sailing for Netflix so far. The streaming giant has experienced little to no issues during today's broadcast of both games. Wonder if that'll change with Beyonce's expected halftime performance, coming up in a few hours. Rohan Nadkarni The Ravens received the opening kickoff and their first play from scrimmage was a Derrick Henry run for six yards. Saba Hamedy Netflix loves Mariah Carey so much they played her pre-recorded \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" performance again before game 2. The segment played after a cappella group Pentatonix performed the National Anthem. Greg Rosenstein With Pittsburgh losing to the Kansas City Chiefs earlier today, Baltimore could take over first place in the AFC North with a win against Houston. A win today and a win against Cleveland next week will wrap up the division. Greg Rosenstein Greg Rosenstein The Texans lost 27-19 at the Chiefs in Week 16. They are only 4-5 in the last nine games after starting the season 5-1. Maybe the addition of a new wide receiver will help? After losing Tank Dell to a knee injury, the Texans claimed Diontae Johnson off waivers after Baltimore released him. Greg Rosenstein Baltimore has two straight wins since returning from Week 14 Bye and losing to the Eagles in Week 13. The Ravens clinched a playoff berth with win over Steelers in Week 16. They are outscoring opponents 69-31 during the two-game wining streak (34+ points scored in each win). Baltimore is looking to win three straight games for the first time since winning five straight from Weeks 3-7. Greg Rosenstein This is a rematch of last season’s Divisional Round matchup, won by Baltimore 34-10. Baltimore is 12-2 all-time vs Houston (including playoffs) … but both losses came in Houston.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. CHICAGO (AP) The Seattle Seahawks made just enough plays to boost their fading playoff hopes by beating the struggling Chicago Bears on Thursday night. Now, they'll be rooting for the Arizona Cardinals to beat the Los Angeles Rams this weekend. Riq Woolen intercepted Caleb Williams' late pass and the Seahawks squeezed past Chicago 6-3 on Thursday night to hand the Bears their 10th straight loss. Jason Myers kicked field goals on the game’s first possession and near the end of the second quarter. Leonard Williams had two of Seattle’s seven sacks, and Woolen sealed the win in the closing minute. Chicago (4-12) had a fourth down at the Seattle 40 with 20 seconds remaining. The Seahawks (9-7) brought the blitz, and a leaping Woolen picked off a pass intended for Keenan Allen at the 22, ending Williams’ NFL rookie-record string of passes without an interception at 353. “We're in the mode of control what we can control,” Seattle coach Mike Macdonald said. “We know what's coming next week. We're going to spend this weekend getting our minds and bodies and spirits right to go play a game. We're praying that it's for the division championship.\" Geno Smith threw for 160 yards, and the sluggish Seahawks came away with a win they sorely needed after dropping two in a row. They came in trailing the NFC West-leading Rams by a game with two remaining. “We still are seeing it as a possibility,” Williams said. “In a way, we're trying to say, ‘Let’s control the controlables and let the other things fall into place as they will.'” Seattle's most likely route to the playoffs is by having the Rams lose to Arizona on Saturday and beating Los Angeles to close the regular season. The Seahawks were in control of their postseason destiny before losing to Minnesota last week. “Honestly, we shouldn't be in this position,” Smith said. “That's the main thing, is understanding that we've got to control our destiny when we can. But yeah, I'm going to be a big Kyler Murray fan on Saturday. If they get it done, they get it done. But we're going to go into this last week of the season with the same mindset no matter what.” Chicago has two double-digit losing streaks in general manager Ryan Poles’ three seasons. The Bears dropped the final 10 games two years ago as part of a franchise-worst 14 game slide that stretched into 2023. They’ve never lost more than 10 straight in one season, and fans chanted “Sell the team!” near the end of this one. Chicago's defense did its part. But it was a rough night for the offense. Williams extended his NFL-leading total and individual franchise record for sacks to 67. The Bears broke their previous mark of 66 sacks allowed in 2004, when they used four quarterbacks. Williams acknowledged the hits are taking their toll. But he also vowed to grow from the experience. “Frustrating, annoyed but learning I would say,” he said. “I definitely think this is going to be good for me. I’m excited about this last game and excited about the future.” Smith completed 17 of 23 passes, and the Seahawks improved to 6-1 on the road. Noah Fant had 43 yards receiving, and Zach Charbonnet ran for 57. Chicago is 0-4 since interim coach Thomas Brown replaced the fired Matt Eberflus. Williams was 16 for 28 with 122 yards. It was a big drop from the previous week, when he threw for 334 yards and two touchdowns against NFC leader Detroit following a string of shaky performances. The Bears simply couldn't keep drives going, finishing with 179 yards and converted just 5 of 15 third downs. And for that, tight end Cole Kmet wasn't giving credit to Seattle's defense. “No, I don’t think so,” he said. “I think it was all us, honestly. I think there was a lot of things that we didn’t do well enough and I think that’s kind of been the theme and story of the year for us offensively. Just got to find ways to be better.” Myers kicked a 27-yard field goal on the game's opening drive. Chicago tied it on Cairo Santos' 42 yard field goal with 2:32 left in the half. But Myers booted a 50-yarder in the closing minute, sending the Seahawks to the locker room with a 6-3 lead. Seahawks: Seattle placed RB Kenneth Walker III on injured reserve prior to the game because of an ankle injury. Walker hurt his ankle in last week’s loss to Minnesota and left that game after sitting out the previous two because of a calf problem. He also missed two weeks in September with an oblique issue. ... CB Josh Jobe (knee) got banged up. Seahawks: At Los Angeles next week.

                "title": "Seahawks vs. Bears score, takeaways: Seattle keeps playoff hopes alive with low-scoring 'TNF' win in Chicago - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Seattle Seahawks kept their playoff hopes alive on the day after Christmas, as they defeated Caleb Williams and the Chicago Bears 6-3 on \"Thursday Night Football.\" This was a game that featured three field goals and 13 punts. It was a defensive battle that took place in the rain, but Seattle emerged victorious after a final fourth-quarter stand. The Bears did have a chance to lead a game-tying or game-winning drive late in the final stanza. Williams hit D.J. Moore on an impressive pass on fourth-and-5 from his own 35-yard line, but got as far as the Seahawks' 40-yard line before his final throw ended up in the arms of the wrong team -- Williams' first interception since Oct. 13. Williams completed 16 of 28 passes for 122 yards and the one interception, while Moore caught six passes for 54 yards. Geno Smith completed 17 of 23 passes for 160 yards, and Zach Charbonnet rushed 15 times for 57 yards in the place of the injured Kenneth Walker III. Here are some of Cody Benjamin's takeaways from Thursday's defensive affair: Caleb Williams didn't get the \"W,\" and he didn't get a ton of help from his staff and blockers, either, but he did make magic out of nothing late in the game, avoiding heavy pressure to zip this perfect fourth-down throw and keep Chicago in contention for a last-minute comeback: It actually says something about the Seahawks' mediocrity that on a night Seattle snapped a two-game slide to keep slimming playoff hopes alive, the Bears quarterback was maybe the most impressive player on the field, even as his own team scored a mere three points. No, the rookie wasn't spotless. He hardly hit anything beyond the line until late. But in between another seven sacks, putting him just 10 away from the undesirable single-season record of 76, Williams kept fighting, kept eluding rushers, and kept his eyes downfield for some pinpoint darts in crunch time. He still has some play-extending hunger to rein in, but it's clear that if he ever gets a reliable pairing of coaching and up-front protection, he's got the moxie, mobility and snappy arm talent to make the Bears more special than, say, a potential Week 17 spoiler. This isn't a completely fair statement, as the defense is a bright spot under first-year coach Mike Macdonald. The Bears front isn't much to write home about, of course, but Leonard Williams and Ernest Jones IV have feasted with physicality under Macdonald's watch, especially against similar or lesser foes. And yet, all that said, this win hardly moves the needle for the team on the whole. It delays elimination from the wild-card race, but the fact it took all 60 minutes to scrape by an ailing, rebuilding Bears team with a situationally challenged interim coach suggests Seattle doesn't really belong in the postseason anyway. A win is a win, to be sure, but their own offensive operation may have had even less juice than Chicago, with play-caller Ryan Grubb flirting but never committing to a bruising ground game. His Seahawks tenure won't be defined or terminated as a result of Thursday's sloppy affair; the wet Windy City conditions may have played a role in his unusual aversion to downfield shots, and he also came in battling a lingering knee injury. But still, at 34, approaching the end the penultimate season of his contract, Smith isn't exactly blazing to the finish line in a path of glory. A week after his aggressive passing veered into recklessness, helping the Minnesota Vikings preserve a close one against Seattle, the veteran quarterback averaged just 5.5 yards per throw, registering as something of a non-factor in a must-win game that actually should've been more like a cakewalk for a once-firm NFC wild-card contender. The Seahawks (9-7) will finish their 2024 season in Week 18 by visiting the Los Angeles Rams (9-6), who will look to win their fifth straight when they play the rival Arizona Cardinals this Saturday. The Bears (4-12), meanwhile, will close the regular season against the Green Bay Packers (11-4), who shut out the New Orleans Saints on Monday and will visit the Minnesota Vikings this Sunday.

Caleb Williams and the Bears now facing a fourth-and-10 from the Seahawks' 40-yard line with 20-seconds remaining. This is the game. Unreal play from Caleb Williams on third-and-14! Drive is alive. I guess that timeout was a good one! Caleb Williams with an incredible throw on fourth-and-5 to keep the drive alive! Curham with another MASSIVE penalty. His holding penalty took away the TD in the first half, and now he jumps early on fourth-and-1. Bears call timeout in punt formation, and now Caleb Williams is back on the field?!?! Fourth-and-5 at the Bears' own 35-yard line. Looks like Bears are going to go for it on fourth-and-1 on their own 39-yard line. 2:14 remaining in the game. HUGE play here. We have now seen four straight punts. Game still up for grabs with 5:12 remaining in the fourth quarter. Caleb Williams takes over at his own 11-yard line. No. 1 overall pick Caleb Williams has now been sacked 66 times this year, six of them coming tonight vs. the Seahawks for a loss of 41 yards. Those 66 sacks taken rank most in the NFL. C.J. Stroud is second with 52 sacks taken. Bears punt 11 punts, 9 points. Seahawks go three-and-out after the defense forces a stop following the Pharaoh Brown fumble. Chicago's defense is doing all it can tonight, but it may not be enough. After the clutch Kyler Gordon fumble recovery, the Bears offense picked up a total of 1 yard on six plays. Caleb Williams found Keenan Allen for a first down on third-and-1, but then took a 14-yard sack (see below for play). Bears punt as we enter the fourth quarter. Maybe not all of them have been his fault, but Caleb Williams has taken some big sacks in this game After three punts to begin the second half, we got some action. The Bears defense came up huge with a forced fumble off TE Pharaoh Brown. Kyler Gordon recovered the loose football, and took it back all the way 62 yards for the TD, but was then ruled down by contact. Still, a massive play for Chicago. We have seen 9 punts and 9 points thus far. The Seahawks were approaching midfield on their first possession of the second half, before former SEAHAWK Darrell Taylor hit Geno Smith from behind, and forced the fumble. Seattle recovered the loose football, but what a play from the pass rusher traded away to Chicago earlier this season. Smith appears OK, but that was a scary hit from behind. After D'Andre Swift picked up eight yards on second-and-10, the Bears offense couldn't move the chains to stay on the field. We heard loud boos from the Chicago faithful when Roschon Johnson was stuffed on third-and-2. Bears punt. The Seahawks have done a good job stuffing the inside run tonight. Majority of yards coming from short passes/screens. Super sleepy game, but the Seahawks really need this win. The Bears FG drive in the second quarter was impressive. Can Caleb Williams find some similar success moving forward? Let's see. First downs: SEA 9 CHI 5Total yards: SEA 178 CHI 101Total drives: SEA 5 CHI 5Third downs: SEA 3-8 CHI 2-6 Geno Smith 10/15 97 yardsCaleb Williams 7/13 82 yards Zach Charbonnet 9 carries 50 yardsKenny McIntosh 5 carries 37 yardsD'Andre Swift 6 carries 17 yards Noah Fant 3 catches 40 yardsTyler Lockett 3 catches 20 yardsDK Metcalf 2 catches 19 yards DJ Moore 3 catches 37 yardsD'Andre Swift 3 catches 29 yardsKeenan Allen 1 catch 16 yards Geno Smith led his offense 38 yards down the field on eight plays, and Jason Myers hit a 50-yard field goal to give Seattle a 6-3 lead heading into halftime. We have life in Chicago! Caleb Williams took his offense 67 yards down the field on 13 plays, and Santos hits from 42 yards out. Tie game. The Bears had picked up just 25 total yards before that drive! SEA 3, CHI 32:32 remaining in the second quarter Caleb Williams threw a pretty impressive TD to Rome Odunze, but the score was taken off the board thanks to a Curhan holding. A botched snap turns into a first down! This is what Bears fans want to see from Caleb Williams Seattle went 71 yards on 11 plays and hit a field goal on its first possession, but that feels like ages ago. The Seahawks have since punted three times, and picked up 54 total yards. Geno Smith has completed 7/11 passes for 58 yards, but his offense has converted just two of six third downs. Zach Charbonnet and Kenny McIntosh have rushed a combined 12 times for 77 yards. Seems like the Seahawks should just keep pounding the rock. I want to say Zach Charbonnet is an emerging back in this league, but I also don't want to ignore that this Chicago defensive front is getting pushed around. Both can be true. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc. Commissioner.com is a registered trademark of CBS Interactive Inc.

                "content": "The Seattle Seahawks and the Chicago Bears met in Week 17 of the NFL season, in a game that represented the final Thursday Night Football of 2024. The Bears were already eliminated from playoff contention, while the Seahawks could not afford to lose more ground to the Los Angeles Rams. The contest between Caleb Williams and Geno Smith was far from impressive. On a cold night in Chicago, both teams struggled to pass the ball with consistency. At halftime, they had managed to complete just 17 combined passes, with a great Caleb Williams touchdown being nullified by penalty. But the situation became even worse in the second half, when not a single point was scored as the Seahawks ended the game with a win. Looking to predict NFL playoff Scenarios? Try our NFL Playoff Predictor for real-time simulations and stay ahead of the game! Smith once again struggled throughout the game, not being able to lead the offense in any touchdown drive through four quarters. The majority of Seattle fans are upset with Ryan Grubb's job as the offensive coordinator, and this was a huge negative display for his group. As a result of a poor offensive scheme by Grubb, none of Seattle's pass-catchers eclipsed the 50-yard mark, a surprise considering the level of the players they have. At least they were able to run the ball effectively, amassing 4.9 yards per carry during the game, one of their best running displays of the season. Apart from his incredible touchdown pass that was called back for offensive holding, it was another tough night for the Bears rookie. He had just over 50% of completions and was hammered all night by the opposing pass rush, who was able to sack him seven times during the night. Chicago's rushing offense is a big problem, and if you take away Williams' ability to scramble, they had under 4.0 yards per carry during the game. Shane Waldron's firing did gave the offense a new life, but since Thomas Brown was promoted to head coach, it was clear that the system was broken. Chicago Bears Nation!

Seattle is still fighting behind the Rams for the NFC West crown, which made its matchup against the Bears on Thursday night important for its postseason outlook. Luckily for the Seahawks, they escaped with a 6-3 win, as both teams struggled offensively and combined for 13 punts. All nine of Thursday's points came in the first half. Some rainy Chicago weather certainly played a role in the defensive showdown, but neither offense had much juice either. The Bears did make things interesting in the closing moments though, as Caleb Williams kept his team's final drive alive in hopes of tying the matchup or taking the lead. Instead, he was picked off for the first time since October, ending the game after Chicago surrendered seven sacks. MORE NFL WEEK 17: Ultimately, it's the result of Thursday's win that mattered most for the Seahawks, not the fashion in which they reached that win. Seattle improved to 9-7, now tied in the win column with Los Angeles for the time being as a Week 18 contest between the two teams, a game that could potentially help decide the division, looms. First, though, the Seahawks will be hoping the Cardinals can pull off an upset win over the Rams later on in Week 17. For the Bears, who have long been eliminated from playoff contention despite a 4-2 start to the season, the optimistic outlook of their Week 17 loss is that they likely improved their 2025 NFL Draft selection. Now 4-12 and on a 10-game losing streak, the Bears are in the final stages of a lost season — but fortunately, Williams did continue to flash stardom late in Thursday's loss.

Sprinting to his right to avoid pressure, he hits Moore on the move for 14 yards, keeping the Bears' offense on the field. But, the quarterback does take another sack before the two-minute warning hits. .@CALEBcsw & @idjmoore convert on 4th down📺: @NFLonPrime pic.twitter.com/EKyD0yb2C1 10:43 p.m. — With under three minutes left, Chicago gets to a 4th & inches and was about to go for it.

Kyler Gordon snatched the ball, taking it 62 yards as most assumed there had been a whistle, but the officials let it play out. After the play was over, they disappoint the home crowd by ruling that Pharoah Brown was down before he fumbled. 10:05 p.m. — Seattle picks up a first down after Smith finds Smith-Njigba for 19 yards.

                "content": "Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter (/biˈɒnseɪ/ ⓘ, bee-ON-say;[6] born September 4, 1981)[7] is an American singer, songwriter, and businesswoman. Regarded as one of the most influential cultural figures in music history,[8] she has transformed the sound of popular music with her vocal ability, live performances and artistic innovations. Her work is considered to be amongst the greatest of all time.[9] As a child, Beyoncé began performing through various singing and dancing competitions. She debuted in the late 1990s and rose to fame as a member of Destiny's Child, one of the best-selling girl groups of all time. Her debut solo album, Dangerously in Love (2003), became one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century and spawned the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"Crazy in Love\" and \"Baby Boy\". Beyoncé's commercial success continued with the albums B'Day (2006), I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008) and 4 (2011), all of which featured hit singles including \"Irreplaceable\", \"Check on It\", \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on it)\", \"If I Were a Boy\", \"Halo\", \"Run the World (Girls)\" and \"Love On Top\". She has also ventured into acting, with leading roles in the films Dreamgirls (2006), Cadillac Records (2008) and Obsessed (2009). Beyoncé's career shifted after forming her own management company Parkwood Entertainment, creating monocultural events through acclaimed concept albums.[10] She explored personal and sociopolitical themes on Beyoncé (2013) and Lemonade (2016), which are credited with popularizing the surprise album and visual album. The former inspired setting Friday as the Global Release Day, while the latter became the best-selling album of 2016 worldwide. Her ongoing trilogy project – currently consisting of queer-inspired dance album Renaissance (2022) and Americana epic Cowboy Carter (2024) – has highlighted the contributions of Black pioneers to American musical and cultural history, spawning the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"Break My Soul\" and \"Texas Hold 'Em\". Beyoncé is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold 200 million records worldwide, making her the most Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)-certified female artist in history.[11][12][13] Her accolades include the most Grammy Awards (32), NAACP Image Awards (25), BET Awards (32) and Soul Train Music Awards (25) of any artist. Billboard ranked her as the greatest pop star of the 21st century and Rolling Stone named her among the best singers of all time.[14][15] She was repeatedly named artist of the decade for both the 2000s and 2010s, including recognition as the RIAA's Top Certified Artist of the Decade and Pollstar's Touring Artist of the Decade.[16] She is the only female artist to debut all of her eight solo albums at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, and she is the only artist to release new Billboard Hot 100 number-one hits in four different decades (including group achievements).[17] She is a ubiquitous figure within popular culture and has influenced various other artists. Beyoncé Giselle Knowles was born on September 4, 1981, at the Park Plaza Hospital[18] in Houston, Texas, to Tina Knowles (née Beyoncé), a hairdresser and salon owner, and Mathew Knowles, a Xerox sales manager.[19] Tina is Louisiana Creole and Mathew is African American.[20][21][22][23] Beyoncé's younger sister, Solange Knowles, is also a singer and a former backup dancer for Destiny's Child. Solange and Beyoncé are the first sisters to have both had number one solo albums.[24] Beyoncé's maternal grandparents, Lumis Albert Beyincé and Agnéz Deréon (daughter of Odilia Broussard and Eugène DeRouen),[25] were French-speaking Louisiana Creoles, with roots in New Iberia;[26][25][27] She is a descendant of Acadian militia officer Joseph Broussard, who was exiled to French Louisiana after the expulsion of the Acadians, and of the French military officer and Abenaki chief Jean-Vincent d'Abbadie, Baron de Saint-Castin.[21][28] She has additional Breton heritage. Beyoncé's fourth great-grandmother, Marie-Françoise Trahan, was born in 1774 in Bangor, located on Belle Île, France. Trahan was a daughter of Acadians who had taken refuge on Belle Île after the Acadian expulsion. The Estates of Brittany had divided the lands of Belle Île to distribute them among 78 other Acadian families and the already settled inhabitants. The Trahan family lived on Belle Île for over ten years before migrating to Louisiana, where she married a Broussard descendant.[29] Beyoncé researched her ancestry and discovered that she is descended from a slave owner who married his slave.[30] Her mother is also of distant Irish and Jewish ancestry.[31][32][33][26] Beyoncé also has Belgian ancestry from Hainaut Province, Wallonia and is related to a former mayor of Froidchapelle, Belgium.[34][35] Beyoncé was raised with multiple religious traditions, attending St. John's United Methodist Church in Houston as well as St. Mary of the Purification Catholic Church.[36][37][38] She went to St. Mary's Catholic Montessori School in Houston and enrolled in dance classes there.[39] Her singing ability was discovered when dance instructor Darlette Johnson began humming a song and Beyoncé finished it, able to hit the high-pitched notes.[40] Beyoncé's interest in music and performing continued after winning a school talent show at age seven, singing John Lennon's \"Imagine\" to beat 15/16-year-olds.[41][42] In the fall of 1990, Beyoncé enrolled in Parker Elementary School, a music magnet school in Houston, where she performed with the school's choir.[43] She also attended the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts[44] and later Alief Elsik High School.[20][45] Beyoncé was also a member of the choir at St. John's United Methodist Church where she sang her first solo and was a soloist for two years.[37][46] When Beyoncé was eight, she met LaTavia Roberson at an audition for an all-girl entertainment group.[47] They were placed into a group called Girl's Tyme with three other girls, and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston.[48] After seeing the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyoncé later said the song they performed was not good.[49][50] In 1995, Beyoncé's father, Mathew, resigned from his job to manage the group.[51] The move reduced the family's income by half, and Beyoncé's parents were forced to sell their house and cars and move into separated apartments.[20][52] Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B girl groups.[47] The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company.[20] This put further strain on the family, and Beyoncé's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group. In 1996, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records with the assistance of Columbia talent scout Teresa LaBarbera Whites.[41] The group changed their name to Destiny's Child in 1996, based upon a passage in the Book of Isaiah.[53] In 1997, Destiny's Child released their major label debut song \"Killing Time\" on the soundtrack to the 1997 film Men in Black.[50] In November, the group released their debut single and first major hit, \"No, No, No\". They released their self-titled debut album in February 1998, which established the group as a viable act in the music industry.[47] The group released their Multi-Platinum second album The Writing's on the Wall in 1999. The record features songs such as \"Bills, Bills, Bills\", the group's first number-one single, \"Jumpin' Jumpin'\" and \"Say My Name\", which became their most successful song at the time, and would remain one of their signature songs. \"Say My Name\" won the Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and the Best R&B Song at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards.[47] The Writing's on the Wall sold more than eight million copies worldwide.[49] During this time, Beyoncé recorded a duet with Marc Nelson, an original member of Boyz II Men, on the song \"After All Is Said and Done\" for the soundtrack to the 1999 film, The Best Man, as well as \"Ways To Get Cut Off\", a collaboration with fellow Columbia Records signee JoJo Robinson that was later shelved.[54][55] The remaining band members recorded \"Independent Women Part I\", which appeared on the soundtrack to the 2000 film Charlie's Angels. It became their best-charting single, topping the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart for eleven consecutive weeks.[47] In early 2001, while Destiny's Child was completing their third album, Beyoncé landed a major role in the MTV made-for-television film, Carmen: A Hip Hopera, starring alongside American actor Mekhi Phifer. Set in Philadelphia, the film is a modern interpretation of the 19th-century opera Carmen by French composer Georges Bizet.[56] When the third album Survivor was released in May 2001, Luckett and Roberson filed a lawsuit claiming that the songs were aimed at them.[47] The album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 663,000 copies sold.[57] The album spawned other number-one hits, \"Bootylicious\" and the title track, \"Survivor\", the latter of which earned the group a Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.[58] After releasing their holiday album 8 Days of Christmas in October 2001, the group announced a hiatus to further pursue solo careers.[47] In July 2002, Beyoncé made her theatrical film debut, playing Foxxy Cleopatra alongside Mike Myers in the comedy film Austin Powers in Goldmember,[59] which spent its first weekend atop the U.S. box office and grossed $73 million.[60] Beyoncé released \"Work It Out\" as the lead single from its soundtrack album which entered the top ten in the UK, Norway, and Belgium.[61] In 2003, Beyoncé starred opposite Cuba Gooding Jr. in the musical comedy The Fighting Temptations as Lilly, a single mother with whom Gooding's character falls in love.[62] The film received mixed reviews from critics but grossed $30 million in the U.S.[63][64] Beyoncé released \"Fighting Temptation\" as the lead single from the film's soundtrack album, with Missy Elliott, MC Lyte, and Free which was also used to promote the film.[65] Another of Beyoncé's contributions to the soundtrack, \"Summertime\", fared better on the U.S. charts.[66] Beyoncé's first solo recording was a feature on Jay-Z's song \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\" that was released in October 2002, peaking at number four on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart.[68] On June 14, 2003, Beyoncé premiered songs from her first solo album Dangerously in Love during her first solo concert and the pay-per-view television special, \"Ford Presents Beyoncé Knowles, Friends & Family, Live From Ford's 100th Anniversary Celebration in Dearborn, Michigan\".[69] The album was released on June 24, 2003, after Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland had released their solo efforts.[70] The album sold 317,000 copies in its first week, debuted atop the Billboard 200,[71] and has since sold 11 million copies worldwide.[72] The album's lead single, \"Crazy in Love\", featuring Jay-Z, became Beyoncé's first number-one single as a solo artist in the US.[73] The single \"Baby Boy\" also reached number one,[67] and singles, \"Me, Myself and I\" and \"Naughty Girl\", both reached the top-five.[74] The album earned Beyoncé a then record-tying five awards at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards; Best Contemporary R&B Album, Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for \"Dangerously in Love 2\", Best R&B Song and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"Crazy in Love\", and Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for \"The Closer I Get to You\" with Luther Vandross. During the ceremony, she performed with Prince.[75] In November 2003, she embarked on the Dangerously in Love Tour in Europe and later toured alongside Missy Elliott and Alicia Keys for the Verizon Ladies First Tour in North America.[76] On February 1, 2004, Beyoncé performed the American national anthem at Super Bowl XXXVIII, at the Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas.[77] After the release of Dangerously in Love, Beyoncé had planned to produce a follow-up album using several of the left-over tracks. However, this was put on hold so she could concentrate on recording Destiny Fulfilled, the final studio album by Destiny's Child.[78] Released on November 15, 2004, in the U.S.[79] and peaking at number two on the Billboard 200,[80][81] Destiny Fulfilled included the singles \"Lose My Breath\" and \"Soldier\", which reached the top five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[82] Destiny's Child embarked on a worldwide concert tour, Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It sponsored by McDonald's Corporation,[83] and performed songs such as \"No, No, No\", \"Survivor\", \"Say My Name\", \"Independent Women\" and \"Lose My Breath\". In addition to renditions of the group's recorded material, they also performed songs from each singer's solo careers, including numbers from Dangerously in Love. During the last stop of their European tour, in Barcelona on June 11, 2005, Rowland announced that Destiny's Child would disband following the North American leg of the tour.[84] The group released their first compilation album Number 1's on October 25, 2005, in the U.S.[85] and accepted a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in March 2006.[86] The group has sold 60 million records worldwide.[87][88] Beyoncé's second solo album B'Day was released on September 4, 2006, in the U.S., to coincide with her twenty-fifth birthday.[89] It sold 541,000 copies in its first week and debuted atop the Billboard 200, becoming Beyoncé's second consecutive number-one album in the United States.[90] The album's lead single \"Déjà Vu\", featuring Jay-Z, reached the top five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[74] The second international single \"Irreplaceable\" was a commercial success worldwide, reaching number one in Australia, Hungary, Ireland, New Zealand and the United States.[74][91] B'Day also produced three other singles; \"Ring the Alarm\",[92] \"Get Me Bodied\",[93] and \"Green Light\" (released in the United Kingdom only).[94] At the 49th Annual Grammy Awards (2007), B'Day was nominated for five Grammy Awards, including Best Contemporary R&B Album, Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for \"Ring the Alarm\" and Best R&B Song and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration\"for \"Déjà Vu\"; the Freemasons club mix of \"Déjà Vu\" without the rap was put forward in the Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical category.

The appearance was considered controversial as it appeared to reference the 50th anniversary of the Black Panther Party and the NFL forbids political statements in its performances.[171][172][173] Immediately following the performance, Beyoncé announced The Formation World Tour, which highlighted stops in both North America and Europe.[174][175] It marked the first ever all-stadium tour by a female artist and ended on October 7, with Beyoncé bringing out her husband Jay-Z, Kendrick Lamar, and Serena Williams for the last show.[176] The tour went on to win Tour of the Year at the 44th American Music Awards.[177] In April 2016, Beyoncé released a teaser clip for a project called Lemonade. A one-hour film which aired on HBO on April 23, a corresponding album with the same title was released on the same day exclusively on Tidal.[178] Lemonade debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, making Beyoncé the first act in Billboard history to have their first six studio albums debut atop the chart; she broke a record previously tied with DMX in 2013.[179] With all 12 tracks of Lemonade debuting on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, Beyoncé also became the first female act to chart 12 or more songs at the same time.[180] Lemonade was streamed 115 million times through Tidal, setting a record for the most-streamed album in a single week by a female artist in history.[181] It was 2016's third highest-selling album in the U.S. with 1.554 million copies sold in that time period within the country[182] as well as the best-selling album worldwide with global sales of 2.5 million throughout the year.[183] Lemonade became the most critically acclaimed work of her career.[184] Several music publications included the album among the best of 2016, including Rolling Stone, which listed Lemonade at number one.[185] The album's visuals were nominated in 11 categories at the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards, the most ever received by Beyoncé in a single year, and went on to win 8 awards, including Video of the Year for \"Formation\".[186][187] The eight wins made Beyoncé the most-awarded artist in the history of the VMAs (24), surpassing Madonna (20).[188] Beyoncé occupied the sixth place for Time magazine's 2016 Person of the Year.[189] In January 2017, it was announced that Beyoncé would headline the Coachella Music and Arts Festival. This would have made Beyoncé only the second female headliner of the festival since it was founded in 1999.[190] It was later announced on February 23, 2017, that Beyoncé would no longer be able to perform at the festival due to doctor's concerns regarding her pregnancy. The festival owners announced that she would instead headline the 2018 festival.[191] Upon the announcement of Beyoncé's departure from the festival lineup, ticket prices dropped by 12%.[192] At the 59th Grammy Awards in February 2017, Lemonade led the nominations with nine, including Album, Record, and Song of the Year for Lemonade and \"Formation\" respectively,[193] ultimately winning two, Best Urban Contemporary Album for Lemonade and Best Music Video for \"Formation\".[194] In September 2017, Beyoncé collaborated with J Balvin and Willy William, to release a remix of the song \"Mi Gente\".

On November 30, Ed Sheeran announced that Beyoncé would feature on the remix to his song \"Perfect\".[196] \"Perfect Duet\" was released on December 1, 2017. The song reached number-one in the United States, becoming Beyoncé's sixth song of her solo career to do so.[197] On January 4, 2018, the music video of Beyoncé and Jay-Z's 4:44 collaboration, \"Family Feud\" was released.[198] It was directed by Ava DuVernay. On March 1, 2018, DJ Khaled released \"Top Off\" as the first single from his forthcoming album Father of Asahd featuring Beyoncé, husband Jay-Z, and Future.[199] On April 14, 2018, Beyoncé played the first of two weekends as the headlining act of the Coachella Music Festival. Her performance of April 14, attended by 125,000 festival-goers, was immediately praised, with multiple media outlets describing it as historic. The performance became the most-tweeted-about performance of weekend one, as well as the most-watched live Coachella performance and the most-watched live performance on YouTube of all time. The show paid tribute to black culture, specifically historically black colleges and universities and featured a live band with over 100 dancers. Destiny's Child also reunited during the show.[200][201] On June 6, 2018, Beyoncé and husband Jay-Z kicked-off the On the Run II Tour in Cardiff, United Kingdom. Ten days later, at their final London performance, the pair unveiled Everything Is Love, their joint studio album, credited under the name The Carters, and initially available exclusively on Tidal. The pair also released the video for the album's lead single, \"Apeshit\", on Beyoncé's official YouTube channel.[202][203] Everything Is Love received generally positive reviews,[204] and debuted at number two on the U.S. Billboard 200, with 123,000 album-equivalent units, of which 70,000 were pure album sales.[205] On December 2, 2018, Beyoncé alongside Jay-Z headlined the Global Citizen Festival: Mandela 100 which was held at FNB Stadium in Johannesburg, South Africa.[206] Their 2-hour performance had concepts similar to the On the Run II Tour and Beyoncé was praised for her outfits, which paid tribute to Africa's diversity.[207] Homecoming: A Film by Beyoncé, a documentary and concert film focusing on Beyoncé's historic 2018 Coachella performances, was released by Netflix on April 17, 2019.[208][209] The film was accompanied by the surprise live album Homecoming: The Live Album.[210] It was later reported that Beyoncé and Netflix had signed a $60 million deal to produce three different projects, one of which is Homecoming.[211] Homecoming: A Film by Beyoncé received six nominations at the 71st Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards.[212] Beyoncé starred as the voice of Nala in the remake The Lion King, which was released in July 2019.[213] Beyoncé is featured on the film's soundtrack, released on July 11, 2019, with a remake of the song \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" alongside Donald Glover, Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen, which was originally composed by Elton John.[214] An original song from the film by Beyoncé, \"Spirit\", was released as the lead single from both the soundtrack and The Lion King: The Gift – a companion album released alongside the film, produced and curated by Beyoncé.[215][216] Beyoncé called The Lion King: The Gift a \"sonic cinema\". She stated that the album was influenced by R&B, pop, hip hop, gqom and Afro Beat.[215][217] The songs were produced by African producers, which Beyoncé said was because \"authenticity and heart were important to [her]\", since the film is set in Africa.[215] In September of the same year, a documentary chronicling the development, production and early music video filming of The Lion King: The Gift entitled \"Beyoncé Presents: Making The Gift\" was aired on ABC.[218] In April 2020, Beyoncé was featured on the remix of Megan Thee Stallion's song \"Savage\", marking her first music release for the year.[219] The song peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, marking Beyoncé's eleventh song to do so across all acts.[220] On June 19, 2020, Beyoncé released the nonprofit charity single \"Black Parade\".[221] On June 23, she followed up the release of its studio version with an a cappella version exclusively on Tidal.[222] Black Is King, a visual album based on the music of The Lion King: The Gift, premiered globally on Disney+ on July 31, 2020. Produced by Disney and Parkwood Entertainment, the film was written, directed and executively produced by Beyoncé. The film was described by Disney as \"a celebratory memoir for the world on the Black experience\".[223] Beyoncé received the most nominations (9) at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards and the most awards (4), which made her the most-awarded singer, most-awarded female artist, and second-most-awarded artist in Grammy history.[224] In 2021, Beyoncé wrote and recorded a song titled \"Be Alive\" for the biographical drama film King Richard.[225] She received her first Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song at the 94th Academy Awards for the song, alongside co-writer Dixson.[226] On March 27, 2022, Beyoncé performed \"Be Alive\" at the 94th Academy Awards. Choreographed by friend and past collaborator Fatima Robinson, Beyoncé was applauded for choosing to perform on the Compton tennis courts Venus and Serena Williams practiced on in their childhood instead of at the venue.[227][228] On June 9, 2022, Beyoncé removed her profile pictures across various social media platforms, causing speculation that she would be releasing new music.[229] Days later, Beyoncé caused further speculation via her nonprofit BeyGood's Twitter account hinting at her upcoming seventh studio album.[230] On June 15, 2022, Beyoncé officially announced her seventh studio album, titled Renaissance.[231] The lead single of Renaissance, \"Break My Soul\", was released on June 20, 2022.[232] The album was released on July 29, 2022.[233][234] \"Break My Soul\" became Beyoncé's 20th top ten single on the Billboard Hot 100, which made her join Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson as the only artists in Hot 100 history to achieve at least twenty top tens as a solo artist and ten as a member of a group.[235] As Renaissance was released, Beyoncé announced that the album was the first installment of a trilogy she conceived and recorded over three years during the COVID-19 pandemic. A time she found to be her \"most creative [period].\"[236][231] The three recorded projects are designated into acts under Roman numerals.[237] Upon release, Renaissance received universal acclaim from critics.[238] Renaissance debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, making her the first female artist to have her first seven studio albums debut at number one in the United States.[239] \"Break My Soul\" concurrently rose to number-one on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the twelfth song to do so across her career discography.[240] On January 21, 2023, Beyoncé performed in Dubai at a private show.[241] The performance, which was her first full concert in more than four years, was delivered to an audience of influencers and journalists.[242] Beyoncé was reportedly paid $24 million to perform.[243] Beyoncé faced criticism for her decision to perform in the United Arab Emirates where homosexuality is illegal.[243][242][244] On February 1, Beyoncé announced the Renaissance World Tour with dates in North America and Europe,[245] becoming for a short-span, the highest-grossing tour by a female artist.[246] On July 28, Beyoncé appeared on \"Delresto (Echoes)\", the second single from rapper Travis Scott's album Utopia, eventually becoming her 100th career appearance on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (encompassing Destiny's Child, her solo career, and musical duo The Carters).[247] On November 30, 2023, Beyoncé released documentary concert film Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé written, directed, and produced by her in collaboration with film distributor AMC Theatres. The film chronicles the development and execution of Beyoncé's Renaissance World Tour, and contained new song \"My House\" in the end credits.[248] In February 2024, Beyoncé launched her hair care brand Cécred.[249] On February 11, 2024, immediately following a partner commercial with Verizon for the Super Bowl LVIII, she announced the second installment of her trilogy project and released its first two songs, \"Texas Hold 'Em\" and \"16 Carriages\".[250] \"Texas Hold 'Em\" became her highest chart debut in her career, her ninth solo number-one and her thirteenth across all credits on the Billboard Hot 100. On March 12, 2024, she announced the album's title, Cowboy Carter.[251][252] A country and gospel-tinged record, it was released on March 29 to universal acclaim from critics, and includes collaborations with artists including Tanner Adell and her daughter Rumi Carter, Miley Cyrus, Tiera Kennedy, Willie Jones, Post Malone, Linda Martell, Willie Nelson, Shaboozey, Brittney Spencer, Dolly Parton, and Reyna Roberts.[253] In July 2024, NBC released two promotional commercials featuring Beyoncé for their coverage of the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, France.[254] Set to Cowboy Carter songs \"Ya Ya\" and \"Just For Fun\", she introduced the entire USA Olympic Team and Gold-medal gymnast Simone Biles, respectively.[255][256] On August 20, Beyoncé announced SirDavis, a whiskey in collaboration with Moët Hennessy developed for years prior and co-founded with master distiller Dr. Bill Lumsden.[257] In October 2024, Levi's launched a four-part global campaign with Beyoncé titled \"Reiimagine\" that will stretch into 2025 and focus on women's history of the company, using Cowboy Carter track \"Levii's Jeans\".[258] The first commercial starring Beyoncé amassed 2.4 billion impressions in under a month.[259] Beyoncé reprised her role as Nala for Mufasa: The Lion King, a prequel to the 2019 remake, released in December 2024.[260] On December 25, 2024, Beyoncé headlined the first ever NFL Christmas Gameday Halftime Show.[261] With \"Single Ladies\", clearly I'd just gotten married, and people want to get married every day – then there was the whole Justin Timberlake thing [recreating the video] on Saturday Night Live, and it was also the year YouTube blew up. With \"Irreplaceable\", the aggressive lyrics, the acoustic guitar, and the 808 drum machine – those things don't typically go together, and it sounded fresh. \"Crazy in Love\" was another one of those classic moments in pop culture that none of us expected. I asked Jay to get on the song the night before I had to turn my album in – thank God he did. It still never gets old, no matter how many times I sing it. Critics have described Beyoncé's voice as being mezzo-soprano.[263][264] Jody Rosen highlights her tone and timbre as particularly distinctive, describing her voice as \"one of the most compelling instruments in popular music\".[265] Her vocal abilities mean she is identified as the centerpiece of Destiny's Child.[266] Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that her voice is \"velvety yet tart, with an insistent flutter and reserves of soul belting\".[267] Rosen notes that the hip hop era highly influenced Beyoncé's unique rhythmic vocal style, but also finds her quite traditionalist in her use of balladry, gospel and falsetto.[265] Other critics praise her range and power, with Chris Richards of The Washington Post saying she was \"capable of punctuating any beat with goose-bump-inducing whispers or full-bore diva-roars.\"[268] On the 2023 Rolling Stone's list of the 200 Greatest Singers of all time, Beyoncé ranked at number 8, with the publication noting that \"in [her] voice lies the entire history of Black music\".[269] Beyoncé's music is generally R&B,[270][271] pop[270][272] and hip hop[273] but she also incorporates soul and funk into her songs. 4 demonstrated Beyoncé's exploration of 1990s-style R&B, as well as further use of soul and hip hop than compared to previous releases.[262] While she almost exclusively releases English songs, Beyoncé recorded several Spanish songs for Irreemplazable (re-recordings of songs from B'Day for a Spanish-language audience), and the re-release of B'Day. To record these, Beyoncé was coached phonetically by American record producer Rudy Perez.[274] Beyoncé has received co-writing credits for most of her songs.[275] Her early songs with Destiny's Child were personally driven and female-empowerment themed compositions like \"Independent Women\" and \"Survivor\", but after the start of her relationship with Jay-Z, she transitioned to more man-tending anthems such as \"Cater 2 U\".[276] Beyoncé's songwriting process is also known for combining parts of different tracks, resulting in alteration of song structures. Sia, who co-wrote \"Pretty Hurts\", called Beyoncé \"very Frankenstein when she comes to songs\";[277] Diana Gordon, who co-wrote \"Don't Hurt Yourself\" called her a \"scientist of songs\";[278] Caroline Polachek who co-wrote \"No Angel\", called her a \"genius writer and producer for this reason. She's so good at seeing connections.\"[279] In 2001, she became the first Black woman and second female lyricist to win the Pop Songwriter of the Year award at the ASCAP Pop Music Awards.[20][280] Beyoncé was the third woman to have writing credits on three number-one songs (\"Irreplaceable\", \"Grillz\" and \"Check on It\") in the same year, after Carole King in 1971 and Mariah Carey in 1991. She is tied with American lyricist Diane Warren at third with nine songwriting credits on number-one singles.[281] The latter wrote her song \"I Was Here\" for 4, which was motivated by the September 11 attacks.[282] In May 2011, Billboard magazine listed Beyoncé at number 17 on their list of the Top 20 Hot 100 Songwriters for having co-written eight singles that hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. She was one of only three women on that list, along with Alicia Keys and Taylor Swift.[283] Beyoncé has received criticism, including from journalists and musicians, for the extensive writing credits on her songs.[275] The controversy surrounding her songwriting credits began with interviews in which she attributed herself as the songwriter for songs in which she was a co-writer[284] or for which her contributions were marginal.[275] In a cover story for Vanity Fair in 2005, she claimed to have \"written\" several number-one songs for Destiny's Child, contrary to the credits, which list her as a co-writer among others.[284] During a 2007 interview with Barbara Walters, she claimed to have conceived the musical idea for the Destiny's Child song \"Bootylicious\",[285] which provoked the song's producer Rob Fusari to call her father and then-manager Mathew Knowles in protest over the claim. In 2010, Fusari told Billboard: \"[Knowles] explained to me, in a nice way, he said, 'People don't want to hear about Rob Fusari, producer from Livingston, N.J. No offense, but that's not what sells records. What sells records is people believing that the artist is everything.'\"[286] However, in an interview for Entertainment Weekly in 2016, Fusari said Beyoncé \"had the 'Bootylicious' concept in her head. That was totally her. She knew what she wanted to say. It was very urban pop angle that they were taking on the record.\"[287] I am really passionate about all of the steps [during] the production [...] I love to stack vocals, and I love to create my own little Oreo with arrangements, sometimes it can be thousands of vocals [and then] I go back and then kind of piece things together, because usually the songs are way too long [...] I go back and edit the structure of the song. [I] make sure that [...] every section has an intention, so that takes months. [...] I hear certain elements of things that go with things that are opposites. I am rarely happy with one track, it's usually four or five things put together that again don't really go together. I am so excited when I'm able to adjust the tempo and key and mute certain elements that don't complement and put opposites together. Sometimes it's just like the EQ of a synth or the warmth of a bass or the distortion of a bass that's on a different song and I can hear like, 'Ah! That's exactly what is missing to make the track full and complete!' Beyoncé's collaborators frequently mention her talent and involvement in the record production of her songs,[289][290] sometimes describing her as a genius in the skill.[291] She is known to have favorite saturation and distortion plug‑ins, intentionality about stereo imaging and concentration on individual elements of her songs as a \"focal point\" in production.[292] Beyoncé names Michael Jackson as her major musical influence.[293][294] Aged five, Beyoncé attended her first ever concert where Jackson performed and she claims to have realized her purpose.[295] When she presented him with a tribute award at the World Music Awards in 2006, Beyoncé said, \"if it wasn't for Michael Jackson, I would never ever have performed.\"[296] Beyoncé was heavily influenced by Tina Turner, and once said \"Tina Turner is someone that I admire, because she made her strength feminine and sexy\".[297][298] She admires Diana Ross as an \"all-around entertainer\",[299] and Whitney Houston, who she said \"inspired me to get up there and do what she did.\"[300][301] Beyoncé cited Madonna as an influence \"not only for her musical style, but also for her business sense\",[302] saying that she wanted to \"follow in the footsteps of Madonna and be a powerhouse and have my own empire.\"[303] She also credits Mariah Carey's singing and her song \"Vision of Love\" as influencing her to begin practicing vocal runs as a child.[304][305] Her other musical influences include Rachelle Ferrell,[306] Aaliyah,[307] Janet Jackson,[308] Prince,[309] Lauryn Hill,[299] Sade Adu,[310] Donna Summer,[311] Fairuz,[312][313] Mary J. Blige,[314] Selena,[315] Anita Baker, and Toni Braxton.[299] The feminism and female empowerment themes on Beyoncé's second solo album B'Day were inspired by her role in Dreamgirls[316] and by singer Josephine Baker.[317] Beyoncé paid homage to Baker by performing \"Déjà Vu\" at the 2006 Fashion Rocks concert wearing Baker's trademark mini-hula skirt embellished with fake bananas.[318] Beyoncé's third solo album, I Am... Sasha Fierce, was inspired by Jay-Z and especially by Etta James, whose \"boldness\" inspired Beyoncé to explore other musical genres and styles.[319] Her fourth solo album, 4, was inspired by Fela Kuti, 1990s R&B, Earth, Wind & Fire, DeBarge, Lionel Richie, Teena Marie, The Jackson 5, New Edition, Adele, Florence and the Machine, and Prince.[262] Beyoncé has stated that she is personally inspired by Michelle Obama (the 44th First Lady of the United States), saying \"she proves you can do it all\",[320] and has described Oprah Winfrey as \"the definition of inspiration and a strong woman.\"[299] She has also discussed how Jay-Z is a continuing inspiration to her, both with what she describes as his lyrical genius and in the obstacles he has overcome in his life.[321] Beyoncé has expressed admiration for the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, posting in a letter \"what I find in the work of Jean-Michel Basquiat, I search for in every day in music ... he is lyrical and raw\".[322][323] Beyoncé has also cited Cher as a fashion inspiration.[324] In 2006, Beyoncé introduced her all-female tour band Suga Mama (also the name of a song on B'Day) which includes bassists, drummers, guitarists, horn players, keyboardists and percussionists.[325] Her background singers, The Mamas, consist of Montina Cooper-Donnell, Crystal Collins and Tiffany Moniqué Riddick. They made their debut appearance at the 2006 BET Awards and re-appeared in the music videos for \"Irreplaceable\" and \"Green Light\".[274] The band have supported Beyoncé in most subsequent live performances, including her 2007 concert tour The Beyoncé Experience, I Am... Tour (2009–2010), The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour (2013–2014) and The Formation World Tour (2016). Beyoncé has received praise for her stage presence and voice during live performances. According to Barbara Ellen of The Guardian, Beyoncé is the most in-charge female artist she's seen onstage.[326] Similarly, Alice Jones of The Independent wrote she \"takes her role as entertainer so seriously she's almost too good.\"[327] The ex-President of Def Jam L.A. Reid has described Beyoncé as the greatest entertainer alive.[328] Jim Farber of the Daily News and Stephanie Classen of The StarPhoenix both praised her strong voice and her stage presence.[329][330] I choose to invest my time and energy only in projects that I am passionate about. Once I've committed, I give it all of me. I start with identifying my intention and making sure that I am aligned with the collaborators for the same purpose. It takes enormous patience to rock with me. My process is tedious. I review every second of footage several times and know it backwards and forwards. I find every ounce of magic and then I deconstruct it. I keep building more layers and repeat this editing process for months. I won't let up until it's undeniably reached its full potential. I believe my strength is understanding how storytelling, music, lighting, angles, fashion, art direction, history, dance, and editing work together. They are all equally important. Beyoncé has worked with numerous directors for her music videos throughout her career, including Melina Matsoukas, Jonas Åkerlund, and Jake Nava. Bill Condon, director of Beauty and the Beast, stated that the Lemonade visuals in particular served as inspiration for his film, commenting, \"You look at Beyoncé's brilliant movie Lemonade, this genre is taking on so many different forms ... I do think that this very old-school break-out-into-song traditional musical is something that people understand again and really want.\"[332] Described as being \"sexy, seductive and provocative\" when performing on stage, Beyoncé has said that she originally created the alter ego \"Sasha Fierce\" to keep that stage persona separate from who she really is. She described Sasha Fierce as being \"too aggressive, too strong, too sassy [and] too sexy\", stating, \"I'm not like her in real life at all.\"[333] Sasha was conceived during the making of \"Crazy in Love\", and Beyoncé introduced her with the release of her 2008 album, I Am... Sasha Fierce. In February 2010, she announced in an interview with Allure magazine that she was comfortable enough with herself to no longer need Sasha Fierce.[334] However, Beyoncé announced in May 2012 that she would bring her back for her Revel Presents: Beyoncé Live shows later that month.[335] Beyoncé has been described as having sex appeal, with music journalist Touré writing that since the release of Dangerously in Love, she has \"become a crossover sex symbol\".[336] When off stage, Beyoncé says that while she likes to dress sexily, her onstage dress \"is absolutely for the stage\".[337] Due to her curves and the term's catchiness, in the 2000s, the media often used the term \"bootylicious\" (a portmanteau of the words \"booty\" and \"delicious\") to describe Beyoncé,[338][339] the term popularized by the single of the same name by her group Destiny's Child. In 2006, it was added to the Oxford English Dictionary.[340] In September 2010, Beyoncé made her runway modelling debut at Tom Ford's Spring/Summer 2011 fashion show.[341] She was named the \"World's Most Beautiful Woman\" by People[342] and the \"Hottest Female Singer of All Time\" by Complex in 2012.[343] In January 2013, GQ placed her on its cover, featuring her atop its \"100 Sexiest Women of the 21st Century\" list.[344][345] VH1 listed her at number 1 on its 100 Sexiest Artists list.[346] Several wax figures of Beyoncé are found at Madame Tussauds Wax Museums in major cities around the world.[347] According to Italian fashion designer Roberto Cavalli, Beyoncé uses different fashion styles to work with her music while performing.[348] Her mother co-wrote a book, published in 2002, titled Destiny's Style,[349] an account of how fashion affected the trio's success.[350] The B'Day Anthology Video Album showed many instances of fashion-oriented footage, depicting classic to contemporary wardrobe styles.[351] In 2007, Beyoncé was featured on the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, becoming the second African American woman after model and television personality Tyra Banks,[352] and People magazine recognized Beyoncé as the best-dressed celebrity.[353] Beyoncé has been nicknamed \"Queen Bey\" by publications over the years. The term is a reference to the common phrase \"queen bee\", a term used for the leader of a group of females. The nickname also refers to the Queen bee of a beehive, with her fan base being named \"BeyHive\". BeyHive was previously titled \"The Beyontourage\", (a portmanteau of Beyoncé and entourage), but was changed after online petitions on Twitter and online news reports during competitions.[354] In 2006, the animal rights organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), criticized Beyoncé for wearing and using fur in her clothing line House of Deréon.[355] Emmett Price, a professor of music at Northeastern University, wrote in 2007 that he thinks race plays a role in many criticisms of Beyoncé's image, saying white celebrities who dress similarly do not attract as many comments.[356] In 2008, the French personal care company L'Oréal was accused of whitening her skin in their Feria hair color advertisements, responding that \"it is categorically untrue\",[357][358] and in 2013, Beyoncé herself criticized H&M for their proposed \"retouching\" of promotional images of her, and according to Vogue requested that only \"natural pictures be used\".[359] Beyoncé has been a vocal advocate for the Black Lives Matter movement. The release of \"Formation\" on February 6, 2016, saw her celebrate her Sub-Saharan Black African ancestry, with the song's music video featuring pro-black imagery and a shot of wall graffiti that says \"Stop shooting us\". The day after the song's release, she performed it at the 2016 Super Bowl halftime show with back up dancers dressed to represent the Black Panther Party. This incited criticism from conservative politicians and police officers, with some police boycotting Beyoncé's then upcoming Formation World Tour.[360] Beyoncé responded to the backlash by releasing tour merchandise that said \"Boycott Beyoncé\",[361][362][363] and later clarified her sentiment, saying: \"Anyone who perceives my message as anti-police is completely mistaken. I have so much admiration and respect for officers and the families of officers who sacrifice themselves to keep us safe,\" Beyoncé said. \"But let's be clear: I am against police brutality and injustice. Those are two separate things.\"[364] In 2002, Beyoncé and Jay-Z collaborated on the song \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\",[365] which appeared on his seventh album The Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse (2002).[366] Beyoncé appeared as Jay-Z's girlfriend in the music video for the song, fueling speculation about their relationship.[367] On April 4, 2008, Beyoncé and Jay-Z married without publicity.[368] As of April 2014[update], the couple had sold a combined 300 million records together.[168] They are known for their private relationship, although they have appeared to become more relaxed since 2013.[369] Both have acknowledged difficulty that arose in their marriage after Jay-Z had an affair.[370][371] Beyoncé miscarried around 2010 or 2011, describing it as \"the saddest thing\" she had ever endured.[372] She returned to the studio and wrote music to cope with the loss. In April 2011, Beyoncé and Jay-Z traveled to Paris to shoot the album cover for 4, and she unexpectedly became pregnant in Paris.[373] In August, the couple attended the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, at which Beyoncé performed \"Love On Top\" and ended the performance by revealing she was pregnant.[374] Her appearance helped that year's MTV Video Music Awards become the most-watched broadcast in MTV history, pulling in 12.4 million viewers;[375] the announcement was listed in Guinness World Records for \"most tweets per second recorded for a single event\" on Twitter,[376] receiving 8,868 tweets per second[377] and \"Beyonce pregnant\" was the most Googled phrase the week of August 29, 2011.[378] On January 7, 2012, Beyoncé gave birth to a daughter, Blue Ivy, at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.[379] Following the release of Lemonade, which included the single \"Sorry\", in 2016, speculations arose about Jay-Z's alleged infidelity with a mistress referred to as \"Becky\". Jon Pareles in The New York Times pointed out that many of the accusations were \"aimed specifically and recognizably\" at him.[380] Similarly, Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone noted the lines \"Suck on my balls, I've had enough\" were an \"unmistakable hint\" that the lyrics revolve around Jay-Z.[381] On February 1, 2017, she revealed on her Instagram account that she was expecting twins. Her announcement gained over 6.3 million likes within eight hours, breaking the world record for the most liked image on the website at the time.[382] On July 13, 2017, Beyoncé uploaded the first image of herself and the twins onto her Instagram account, confirming their birth date as a month prior, on June 13, 2017,[383] with the post becoming the second most liked on Instagram, behind her own pregnancy announcement.[384] The twins, a daughter named Rumi and a son named Sir, were born at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in California via caesarean section. She wrote of her pregnancy and its aftermath in the September 2018 issue of Vogue, in which she had full control of the cover, shot at Hammerwood Park by photographer Tyler Mitchell.[385][386] Beyoncé performed \"America the Beautiful\" at President Barack Obama's 2009 presidential inauguration, as well as \"At Last\" during the first inaugural dance at the Neighborhood Ball two days later.[387] The couple held a fundraiser at Jay-Z's 40/40 Club in Manhattan for President Obama's 2012 presidential campaign[388] which raised $4 million.[389] Beyoncé voted for Obama in the 2012 presidential election.[390] She performed the American national anthem \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at his second inauguration in January 2013.[147] The Washington Post reported in May 2015, that Beyoncé attended a major celebrity fundraiser for 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.[391] She also headlined for Clinton in a concert held the weekend before Election Day the next year. In this performance, Beyoncé and her entourage of backup dancers wore pantsuits; a clear allusion to Clinton's frequent dress-of-choice. The backup dancers also wore \"I'm with her\" tee shirts, the campaign slogan for Clinton. In a brief speech at this performance Beyoncé said, \"I want my daughter to grow up seeing a woman lead our country and knowing that her possibilities are limitless.\"[392] She endorsed the bid of Beto O'Rourke during the 2018 United States Senate election in Texas.[393] In July 2024, Beyoncé gave Vice President Kamala Harris permission to use Lemonade promotional single \"Freedom\" as the official song for her 2024 presidential campaign.[394][395] Harris subsequently launched a digital ad in support of her candidacy featuring the song.[396] In October 2024, Beyoncé, alongside her mother Tina and Kelly Rowland endorsed Harris for president at a campaign rally in her hometown of Houston.[397] In a 2013 interview with Vogue, Beyoncé stated that she considered herself to be \"a modern-day feminist\".[398] She would later align herself more publicly with the movement, sampling \"We should all be feminists\", a speech delivered by Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie at a TEDx talk in April 2013, in her song \"Flawless\", released later that year.[399] The next year she performed live at the MTV Video Awards in front a giant backdrop reading \"Feminist\".[400] Her self-identification incited a circulation of opinions and debate about whether her feminism is aligned with older, more established feminist ideals. Annie Lennox, celebrated artist and feminist advocate, referred to Beyoncé's use of her word feminist as 'feminist lite'.[401] Adichie responded with \"her type of feminism is not mine, as it is the kind that, at the same time, gives quite a lot of space to the necessity of men.\"[402] Adichie expands upon what \"feminist lite\" means to her, referring that \"more troubling is the idea, in Feminism Lite, that men are naturally superior but should be expected to 'treat women well'\" and \"we judge powerful women more harshly than we judge powerful men. And Feminism Lite enables this.\"[403] Beyoncé responded about her intent by utilizing the definition of feminist with her platform was to \"give clarity to the true meaning\" behind it. She says to understand what being a feminist is, \"it's very simple. It's someone who believes in equal rights for men and women.\" She advocated to provide equal opportunities for young boys and girls, men and women must begin to understand the double standards that remain persistent in our societies and the issue must be illuminated in effort to start making changes.[404] She has also contributed to the Ban Bossy campaign, which uses TV and social media to encourage leadership in girls.[405] Following Beyoncé's public identification as a feminist, the sexualized nature of her performances and the fact that she championed her marriage was questioned.[406] In December 2012, Beyoncé along with a variety of other celebrities teamed up and produced a video campaign for \"Demand A Plan\", a bipartisan effort by a group of 950 U.S. mayors and others[407] designed to influence the federal government into rethinking its gun control laws, following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.[408] Beyoncé publicly endorsed same-sex marriage on March 26, 2013, after the Supreme Court debate on California's Proposition 8.[409] She spoke against North Carolina's Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, a bill passed (and later repealed) that discriminated against the LGBT community in public places in a statement during her concert in Raleigh as part of the Formation World Tour in 2016.[410] She has condemned police brutality against black Americans. She and Jay-Z attended a rally in 2013 in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman for the killing of Trayvon Martin.[411] The film for her sixth album Lemonade included the mothers of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Eric Garner, holding pictures of their sons in the video for \"Freedom\".[412] In a 2016 interview with Elle, Beyoncé responded to the controversy surrounding her song \"Formation\" which was perceived to be critical of the police. She clarified, \"I am against police brutality and injustice. Those are two separate things. If celebrating my roots and culture during Black History Month made anyone uncomfortable, those feelings were there long before a video and long before me\".[413] In February 2017, Beyoncé spoke out against the withdrawal of protections for transgender students in public schools by Donald Trump's presidential administration. Posting a link to the 100 Days of Kindness campaign on her Facebook page, Beyoncé voiced her support for transgender youth and joined a roster of celebrities who spoke out against Trump's decision.[414] Beyoncé has been documented pursuing many passions, sometimes being described as a renaissance woman.[415][416] Some of these include canvas painting,[417] video editing,[418] poetry,[419] scriptwriting,[420] lighting and stage design,[421] animation and clothes design,[422] photography,[423] cultural historiography[424] and beekeeping (with around 80,000 bees).[331] I started painting portraits of women [in 2002], while filming Austin Powers [...] I got hooked and wouldn't sleep. I made this special room with saris and pillows. I would light candles, play Miles Davis and Björk, and paint all night. It was very therapeutic. Whenever I finish one of my paintings, I try to figure out what it represents in my life. I'll be like, 'It's dark behind her and light in front of her, so a dark period must be coming to an end. Something light and beautiful is going to happen.' Forbes magazine began reporting on Beyoncé's earnings in 2008, calculating that the $80 million earned between June 2007 to June 2008, for her music, tour, films and clothing line made her the world's best-paid music personality at the time, above Madonna and Celine Dion.[425][426] It placed her fourth on the Celebrity 100 list in 2009[427] and ninth on the \"Most Powerful Women in the World\" list in 2010.[428] The following year, the magazine placed her eighth on the \"Best-Paid Celebrities Under 30\" list, having earned $35 million in the past year for her clothing line and endorsement deals. In 2012, Forbes placed Beyoncé at number 16 on the Celebrity 100 list, twelve places lower than three years ago yet still having earned $40 million in the past year for her album 4, clothing line and endorsement deals.[429][430] In 2012, Beyoncé and Jay-Z placed at number one on the \"World's Highest-Paid Celebrity Couples\", for collectively earning $78 million.[431] The couple made it into the previous year's Guinness World Records as the \"highest-earning power couple\" for collectively earning $122 million in 2009.[432] For the years 2009 to 2011, Beyoncé earned an average of $70 million per year, and earned $40 million in 2012.[433] In 2013, Beyoncé's endorsements of Pepsi and H&M made her and Jay-Z the world's first billion-dollar couple in the music industry.[434] That year, Beyoncé was listed as the fourth-most-powerful celebrity in the Forbes rankings.[435] In June 2014, Beyoncé ranked at number one on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list, earning an estimated $115 million throughout June 2013 – June 2014. This in turn was the first time she had topped the Celebrity 100 list as well as being her highest yearly earnings to date.[436] In 2016, Beyoncé ranked at number 34 on the Celebrity 100 list with earnings of $54 million. She and Jay-Z also topped the highest-paid celebrity couple list, with combined earnings of $107.5 million.[437] Beyoncé is one of the wealthiest musical artists. As of 2018[update], Forbes calculated her net worth to be $355 million, and in June of the same year, ranked her as the 35th-highest-earning celebrity, with annual earnings of $60 million. This tied Beyoncé with Madonna as the only two female artists to earn more than $100 million within a single year twice.[438][439] As a couple, Beyoncé and Jay-Z have a combined net worth of $1.16 billion.[440] In July 2017, Billboard announced that Beyoncé was the highest-paid musician of 2016, with an estimated total of $62.1 million.[441] By December 2023, Forbes estimated Beyoncé's net worth to be $800 million.[442] In 2023, the couple bought a house in Malibu, California, designed by the architect Tadao Ando, for $200 million. It established a record for the most expensive residence sold in the state of California.[443] Beyoncé's success has led to her becoming a cultural icon and earning her the nickname \"Queen Bey\".[444] Constance Grady wrote for Vox, \"The transformation of Beyoncé from well-liked pop star to cultural icon came in three phases, punctuated by the self-titled Beyoncé album of 2013, 2016's Lemonade, and 2018's Homecoming concert at Coachella.\"[445] In The New Yorker, music critic Jody Rosen described Beyoncé as \"the most important and compelling popular musician of the twenty-first century ... the result, the logical end point, of a century-plus of pop.\"[446] She topped NPR list of the \"21st Century's Most Influential Women Musicians\".[447] James Clear, in his book Atomic Habits (2018), draws a parallel between Beyoncé's success and the dramatic transformations in modern society: \"In the last one hundred years, we have seen the rise of the car, the airplane, the television, the personal computer, the internet, the smartphone, and Beyoncé.\"[448] The Observer named her Artist of the Decade (2000s) in 2009.[449] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Alex Suskind opined that Beyoncé was the decade's (2010s) defining pop star, stating \"no one dominated music in the 2010s like Queen Bey\", explaining that her \"songs, album rollouts, stage presence, social justice initiatives, and disruptive public relations strategy have influenced the way we've viewed music since 2010.\"[450] Based on Billboard rankings of chart success and sales, Beyonce was ranked 9th on the Top R&B and Hip Hop artists of the 2010s decade chart, behind the likes of Drake, Rihanna, Chris Brown, Nicki Minaj, Post Malone, The Weeknd, Kendrick Lamar and Lil Wayne in ranks 1 through 8, respectively.[451] British publication NME also shared similar thoughts on her impact in the 2010s, including Beyoncé on their list of the \"10 Artists Who Defined The Decade\".[452] In 2018, Rolling Stone included her on its Millennial 100 list.[453] Music critics have often credited Beyoncé with the invention of the staccato rap-singing style that has since dominated pop, R&B, and rap music. Lakin Starling of The Fader wrote that Beyoncé's innovative implementation of the delivery style on Destiny's Child's 1999 album The Writing's on the Wall invented a new form of R&B.[454] The staccato rap-singing style continued to be used in the music industry in the late 2010s and early 2020s; Aaron Williams of Uproxx described Beyoncé as the \"primary pioneer\" of the rapping style that dominates the music industry today, with many rappers implementing Beyoncé's rap-singing.[455] Michael Eric Dyson agrees, saying in 2019 that Beyoncé \"changed the whole genre\" and has become the \"godmother\" of mumble rappers, who use the staccato rap-singing cadence. Dyson added: \"She doesn't get credit for the remarkable way in which she changed the musical vocabulary of contemporary art.\"[456] Beyoncé has been credited with reviving the album as an art form in an era dominated by singles and streaming. This started with her 2011 album 4; while mainstream R&B artists were forgoing albums-led R&B in favor of singles-led EDM, Beyoncé aimed to place the focus back on albums as an art form and re-establish R&B as a mainstream concern.[457] This remained a focus of Beyoncé's, and in 2013, she made her eponymous album only available to purchase as a full album on iTunes, rather than being able to purchase individual tracks or consume the album via streaming. Kaitlin Menza of Marie Claire wrote that this made listeners \"experience the album as one whole sonic experience, the way people used to, noting the musical and lyrical themes\".[458] Jamieson Cox for The Verge described how Beyoncé's 2013 album initiated a gradual trend of albums becoming more cohesive and self-referential, and this phenomenon reached its endpoint with Lemonade, which set \"a new standard for pop storytelling at the highest possible scale\".[459] Megan Carpentier of The Guardian wrote that with Lemonade, Beyoncé has \"almost revived the album format\" by releasing an album that can only be listened to in its entirety.[460] Myf Warhurst on Double J's \"Lunch With Myf\" explained that while most artists' albums consist of a few singles plus filler songs, Beyoncé \"brought the album back\", changing the art form of the album \"to a narrative with an arc and a story and you have to listen to the entire thing to get the concept\".[461] She is known for coining popular phrases such as \"put a ring on it\", a euphemism for marriage proposal, \"I woke up like this\", which started a trend of posting morning selfies with the hashtag #iwokeuplikethis, and \"boy, bye\", which was used as part of the Democratic National Committee's campaign for the 2020 election.[462][463] Similarly, she also came up with the phrase \"visual album\" following the release of her fifth studio album, which had a video for every song. This has been recreated by many other artists since, such as Frank Ocean and Melanie Martinez.[464] The album also popularized surprise releases, with many artists releasing songs, videos or albums with no prior announcement, such as Taylor Swift, Nicki Minaj, Eminem, Frank Ocean, Jay-Z and Drake.[465] In January 2012, research scientist Bryan Lessard named Scaptia beyonceae, a species of horse-fly found in Northern Queensland, Australia after Beyoncé due to the fly's unique golden hairs on its abdomen.[466] Beyoncé has received numerous awards and is the most-awarded female artist of all time.[467] Having sold over 200 million records worldwide (a further 60 million additionally with Destiny's Child), Beyoncé is one of the best-selling music artists of all time.[468] The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) listed Beyoncé as the top certified artist of the 2000s decade, with a total of 64 certifications.[469][470] In 2009, Billboard named her the Top Female Artist and Top Radio Songs Artist of the Decade.[471][472][473] In 2010, Billboard named her in their Top 50 R&B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years list at number 15.[474] In 2012, VH1 ranked her third on their list of the \"100 Greatest Women in Music\", behind Mariah Carey and Madonna.[475] In 2002, she received Songwriter of the Year from American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers becoming the First African American woman to win the award. In 2004 and 2019, she received NAACP Image Award for Entertainer of the Year and the Soul Train Music Award for Sammy Davis Jr. – Entertainer of the Year. In 2005, she also received APEX Award at the Trumpet Award honoring the achievements of Black African Americans. In 2007, Beyoncé received the International Artist of Excellence award by the American Music Awards. She also received Honorary Otto at the Bravo Otto. The following year, she received the Legend Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Arts at the World Music Awards[476] and Career Achievement Award at the LOS40 Music Awards. In 2010, she received the Award of Honor for Artist of the Decade at the NRJ Music Award.[477] At the 2011 Billboard Music Awards, Beyoncé received the inaugural Billboard Millennium Award.[478] Beyoncé received the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards and was honored as Honorary Mother of the Year at the Australian Mother of the Year Award in Barnardo's Australia for her Humanitarian Effort in the region and the Council of Fashion Designers of America Fashion Icon Award in 2016. In 2019, alongside Jay-Z, she received GLAAD Vanguard Award which is presented to a member of the entertainment community who does not identify as LGBT but who has made a significant difference in promoting equal rights for LGBT people.[479] In 2020, she was awarded the BET Humanitarian Award. Consequence named her the 30th best singer of all time.[480] Beyoncé has won 32 Grammy Awards, both as a solo artist and member of Destiny's Child and The Carters, making her the most honored individual by the Grammys.[481][482] She is also the most nominated artist in Grammy Award history with a total of 88 nominations.[483] \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" won Song of the Year in 2010 while \"Say My Name\",[47] \"Crazy in Love\" and \"Drunk in Love\" have each won Best R&B Song. Dangerously in Love, B'Day and I Am... Sasha Fierce have won Best Contemporary R&B Album, while Lemonade has won Best Urban Contemporary Album. Beyoncé set the record for the most Grammy awards won by a female artist in one night in 2010 when she won six awards, breaking the tie she previously held with Alicia Keys, Norah Jones, Alison Krauss, and Amy Winehouse, with Adele equaling this in 2012.[484] Beyoncé has won 30 MTV Video Music Awards, making her the joint most-decorated artist in Video Music Award history.[485] She won 26 awards as a solo artist, two awards each with The Carters and Destiny's Child, making her lifetime total of 30 VMAs.[486] \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" and \"Formation\" won Video of the Year in 2009 and 2016 respectively. Beyoncé tied the record set by Lady Gaga in 2010 for the most VMAs won in one night for a female artist with eight in 2016.[188] She is also the most-awarded and nominated artist in BET Award history,[487] winning 36 awards (including two with Destiny's Child) from over 80 nominations,[488] the most-awarded artist of the Soul Train Music Awards with 25 wins (21 as a soloist and four with Destiny's child),[489] and the most-decorated artist at the NAACP Image Awards with 25 wins as a solo artist and five with Destiny's Child.[490][491] Following her role in Dreamgirls, Beyoncé was nominated for Best Original Song for \"Listen\" and Best Actress at the Golden Globe Awards,[492] and Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture at the NAACP Image Awards.[493] Beyoncé won two awards at the Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards 2006; Best Song for \"Listen\" and Best Original Soundtrack for Dreamgirls: Music from the Motion Picture.[494] According to Fuse in 2014, Beyoncé is the second-most award-winning artist of all time, after Michael Jackson.[495][496] Lemonade won a Peabody Award in 2017.[497] In 2022, \"Be Alive\" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song,[498] the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Song,[499] and the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.[500] She was named on the 2016 BBC Radio 4 Woman's Hour Power List as one of seven women judged to have had the biggest impact on women's lives over the past 70 years, alongside Margaret Thatcher, Barbara Castle, Helen Brook, Germaine Greer, Jayaben Desai and Bridget Jones,[501] She was named the Most Powerful Woman in Music on the same list in 2020.[502] In the same year, Billboard named her with Destiny's Child the third Greatest Music Video artists of all time, behind Madonna and Michael Jackson.[503] In June 2021, Beyoncé won the award of \"top touring artist\" of the decade (2010s) at the Pollstar Awards.[504] In that same month, Beyoncé was inducted into the Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame as a member of the inaugural class.[505] In 2010, Beyoncé founded her own entertainment company Parkwood Entertainment which formed as an imprint based from Columbia Records, the company began as a production unit for videos and films in 2008. Parkwood Entertainment is named after a street in Houston, Texas where Beyoncé once lived.[506] With headquarters in New York City, the company serves as an umbrella for the entertainer's various brands in music, movies, videos, and fashion. The staff of Parkwood Entertainment have experiences in arts and entertainment, from filmmaking and video production to web and fashion design. In addition to departments in marketing, digital, creative, publicity, fashion design and merchandising, the company houses a state-of-the-art editing suite, where Beyoncé works on content for her worldwide tours, music videos, and television specials. Parkwood Entertainment's first production was the musical biopic Cadillac Records (2008), in which Beyoncé starred and co-produced.[507] The company has distributed Beyoncé's albums such as her self-titled fifth studio album (2013), Lemonade (2016) and The Carters, Everything is Love (2018). Beyoncé has signed other artists to Parkwood such as Chloe x Halle, who performed at Super Bowl LIII in February 2019.[508] In February 2024, Beyoncé launched Cécred, a hair care product line developed to fit different hair textures.[249] Following its launch, she established an annual grant in collaboration with BeyGood. This is an effort to provide financial support to cosmetology students and professional hair stylists within the beauty industry.[509] A yearly $500,000 is funding cosmetology school scholarships and salon business grants across five cities chosen for their large, diverse community of hair stylists: Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles and Clementon.[c][510] Beyoncé has worked with Pepsi since 2002,[511] and in 2004 appeared in a Gladiator-themed commercial with Britney Spears, Pink, and Enrique Iglesias.[512] In 2012, Beyoncé signed a $50 million deal to endorse Pepsi.[513] The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPINET) wrote Beyoncé an open letter asking her to reconsider the deal because of the unhealthiness of the product and to donate the proceeds to a medical organisation.[514] Nevertheless, NetBase found that Beyoncé's campaign was the most talked about endorsement in April 2013, with a 70 percent positive audience response to the commercial and print ads.[515] Beyoncé has worked with Tommy Hilfiger for the fragrances True Star (singing a cover version of \"Wishing on a Star\")[516] and True Star Gold;[517] she also promoted Emporio Armani's Diamonds fragrance in 2007.[518] Beyoncé launched her first official fragrance, Heat, in 2010.[519] In February 2011, Beyoncé launched her second fragrance, Heat Rush.[520] Beyoncé's third fragrance, Pulse, was launched in September 2011.[521] In 2013, The Mrs. Carter Show Limited Edition version of Heat was released.[522] The six editions of Heat are the world's best-selling celebrity fragrance line,[522] with sales of over $400 million.[523] The release of a video-game Starpower: Beyoncé was cancelled after Beyoncé pulled out of a $100 million deal with GateFive who alleged the cancellation meant the sacking of 70 staff and millions of pounds lost in development.[524] It was settled out of court by her lawyers in June 2013 who said that they had cancelled because GateFive had lost its financial backers.[525] Beyoncé also has had deals with American Express,[426] Nintendo DS[526] and L'Oréal since the age of 18.[527] In March 2015, Beyoncé became a co-owner, with other artists, of the music streaming service Tidal. The service specializes in lossless audio and high definition music videos. Beyoncé's husband Jay-Z acquired the parent company of Tidal, Aspiro, in the first quarter of 2015.[528] Including Beyoncé and Jay-Z, sixteen artist stakeholders (such as Kanye West, Rihanna, Madonna, Chris Martin, Nicki Minaj and more) co-own Tidal, with the majority owning a 3% equity stake.[529] The idea of having an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to adapt to the increased demand for streaming within the current music industry.[530] In November 2020, Beyoncé formed a multi-year partnership with exercise equipment and media company Peloton. The partnership was formed to celebrate homecoming season in historically black colleges and universities, providing themed workout experiences inspired by Beyoncé's 2019 Homecoming film and live album after 2020's homecoming celebrations were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of the partnership, Beyoncé and Peloton are donating free memberships to all students at 10 HBCUs, and Peloton are pursuing long-term recruiting partnerships at the HCBUs. Gwen Bethel Riley, head of music at Peloton, said: \"When we had conversations with Beyoncé around how critical a social impact component was to all of us, it crystallized how important it was to embrace Homecoming as an opportunity to celebrate and create dialogue around Black culture and music, in partnership with HBCUs.\"[531] Upon news of the partnership, a decline in Peloton's shares reversed, and its shares rose by 8.6%.[532] In 2021, Beyoncé and Jay-Z partnered with Tiffany & Co. for the company's \"About Love\" campaign. Beyoncé became the fourth woman, and first Black woman, to wear the 128.54-carat Tiffany Yellow Diamond.[533] The campaign featured a robin egg blue painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat titled Equals Pi (1982).[534] Both Beyonce and the brand faced significant backlash for the campaign, as the Tiffany Yellow Diamond, which was discovered in the Kimberley diamond mines in South Africa in 1877, is classified as a blood diamond and viewed as a symbol of British colonialism over Africa.[535][536][537] Beyoncé and her mother introduced House of Deréon, a women's fashion line, in 2005.[538] The concept is inspired by three generations of women in their family, with the name paying tribute to Beyoncé's grandmother, Agnèz Deréon, a respected seamstress.[539][540] According to Tina, the overall style of the line best reflects her and Beyoncé's taste and style. Beyoncé and her mother founded their family's company Beyond Productions, which provides the licensing and brand management for House of Deréon, and its junior collection, Deréon.[538] House of Deréon pieces were exhibited in Destiny's Child's shows and tours, during their Destiny Fulfilled era.[541][542] The collection features sportswear, denim offerings with fur, outerwear and accessories that include handbags and footwear, and are available at department and specialty stores across the U.S. and Canada.[538] In 2005, Beyoncé teamed up with House of Brands, a shoe company, to produce a range of footwear for House of Deréon.[543] In January 2008, Starwave Mobile launched Beyoncé Fashion Diva, a \"high-style\" mobile game with a social networking component, featuring the House of Deréon collection.[538] In July 2009, Beyoncé and her mother launched a new junior apparel label, Sasha Fierce for Deréon, for back-to-school selling. The collection included sportswear, outerwear, handbags, footwear, eyewear, lingerie and jewelry.[544] It was available at department stores including Macy's and Dillard's, and specialty stores Jimmy Jazz and Against All Odds.[544] In May 2010, Beyoncé teamed up with clothing store C&A to launch Deréon by Beyoncé at their stores in Brazil.[545] The collection included tailored blazers with padded shoulders, little black dresses, embroidered tops and shirts and bandage dresses.[545] In October 2014, Beyoncé signed a deal to launch an activewear line of clothing with British fashion retailer Topshop.[546][547] The 50–50 venture is called Ivy Park and was launched in April 2016. The brand's name is a nod to Beyoncé's daughter and her favorite number four (IV in Roman numerals), and also references the park where she used to run in Texas.[548] She has since bought out Topshop owner Philip Green from his 50% share after he was alleged to have sexually harassed, bullied and racially abused employees.[549] She now owns the brand herself.[550] In April 2019, it was announced that Beyoncé would become a creative partner with Adidas and further develop her athletic brand Ivy Park with the company. Knowles will also develop new clothes and footwear for Adidas. Shares for the company rose 1.3% upon the news release.[551] In December 2019, they announced a launch date of January 18, 2020.[552] Beyoncé uploaded a teaser on her website and Instagram.[553] The collection was previewed on the upcoming Elle January 2020 issue, where Beyoncé is seen wearing several garments, accessories and footwear from the first collection.[554] In February 2023, The Wall Street Journal reported that the line was struggling financially with revenue falling by more than 50% over the past fiscal year to $40 million; well short of the company's $250 million projected forecast.[555] In March 2023, it was announced that Beyoncé and Adidas reached a mutual decision to end their partnership.[556][557] In March 2023, Olivier Rousteing, the creative director of Balmain, announced that he and Beyoncé collaborated on a couture collection complete with sixteen looks corresponding to the sixteen tracks on her album Renaissance. This \"Renaissance Couture\" collection marked the first time that a Black woman oversaw the development of a collection from a Parisian couture house.[558] In September 2024, Beyoncé partnered with Levi Strauss & Co. to remake a classic '80s 'Launderette' campaign.[559] Michelle Gass, the CEO of Levis Strauss & Co., shared insights regarding the advantages of the company's collaboration with Beyoncé, emphasizing that the advertising campaign could significantly enhance sales in the women's clothing segment.[560] In 2002, Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland and Tina Knowles built the Knowles-Rowland Center for Youth, a community center in Downtown Houston. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Beyoncé and Rowland founded the Survivor Foundation to provide transitional housing to displaced families and provide means for new building construction, to which Beyoncé contributed an initial $250,000.[561] The foundation has since expanded to work with other charities in the city,[562] and also provided relief following Hurricane Ike three years later.[563] Beyoncé also donated $100,000 to the Gulf Coast Ike Relief Fund.[564] In 2007, Beyoncé founded the Knowles-Temenos Place Apartments, a housing complex offering living space for 43 displaced individuals. As of 2016, Beyoncé had donated $7 million for the maintenance of the complex.[565] After starring in Cadillac Records in 2009 and learning about Phoenix House, a non-profit drug and alcohol rehabilitation organization, Beyoncé donated her full $4 million salary from the film to the organization. Beyoncé and her mother subsequently established the Beyoncé Cosmetology Center, which offers a seven-month cosmetology training course helping Phoenix House's clients gain career skills during their recovery.[566] In January 2010, Beyoncé participated in George Clooney and Wyclef Jean's Hope for Haiti Now: A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief telethon,[567] donated a large sum to the organization,[568] and was named the official face of the limited edition Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) \"Fashion For Haiti\" T-shirt.[569] In April 2011, Beyoncé joined forces with U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama and the National Association of Broadcasters Education Foundation, to help boost the latter's campaign against child obesity[570] by reworking her single \"Get Me Bodied\".[571] Following the death of Osama bin Laden, Beyoncé released her cover of the Lee Greenwood song \"God Bless the U.S.A.\", as a charity single to help raise funds for the New York Police and Fire Widows' and Children's Benefit Fund.[572] Beyoncé became an ambassador for the 2012 World Humanitarian Day campaign donating her song \"I Was Here\" and its music video, shot in the UN, to the campaign.[573][574] In 2013, it was announced that Beyoncé would work with Salma Hayek and Frida Giannini on a Gucci \"Chime for Change\" campaign that aims to spread female empowerment. The campaign, which aired on February 28, was set to her new music.[575] A concert for the cause took place on June 1, 2013, in London.[576] With help of the crowdfunding platform Catapult, visitors of the concert could choose between several projects promoting education of women and girls.[577][578] Beyoncé also took part in \"Miss a Meal\", a food-donation campaign,[579] and supported Goodwill Industries through online charity auctions at Charitybuzz that support job creation throughout Europe and the U.S.[580][581] Beyoncé and Jay-Z secretly donated tens of thousands of dollars to bail out Black Lives Matter protesters in Baltimore and Ferguson, as well as funded infrastructure for the establishment of Black Lives Matter chapters across the U.S.[582] Before Beyoncé's Formation World Tour show in Tampa, her team held a private luncheon for more than 20 community leaders to discuss how Beyoncé could support local charitable initiatives, including pledging on the spot to fund 10 scholarships to provide students with financial aid. Tampa Sports Authority board member Thomas Scott said: \"I don't know of a prior artist meeting with the community, seeing what their needs are, seeing how they can invest in the community. It says a lot to me about Beyoncé. She not only goes into a community and walks away with (money), but she also gives money back to that community.\"[583] In June 2016, Beyoncé donated over $82,000 to the United Way of Genesee County to support victims of the Flint water crisis. Beyoncé additionally donated money to support 14 students in Michigan with their college expenses.[584] In August 2016, Beyoncé and Jay-Z donated $1.5 million to civil rights groups including Black Lives Matter, Hands Up United and Dream Defenders.[585] After Hurricane Matthew, Beyoncé and Jay-Z donated $15 million to the Usain Bolt Foundation to support its efforts in rebuilding homes in Haiti.[586] During Hurricane Harvey in August 2017, Beyoncé launched BeyGOOD Houston to support those affected by the hurricane in Houston. The organization donated necessities such as cots, blankets, pillows, baby products, feminine products and wheelchairs, and funded long-term revitalization projects.[587] On September 8, Beyoncé visited Houston, where she sponsored a lunch for 400 survivors at her local church, visited the George R Brown Convention Center to discuss with people displaced by the flooding about their needs, served meals to those who lost their homes, and made a significant donation to local causes.[588][589] Beyoncé additionally donated $75,000 worth of new mattresses to survivors of the hurricane.[590] Later that month, Beyoncé released a remix of J Balvin and Willy William's \"Mi Gente\", with all of her proceeds being donated to disaster relief charities in Puerto Rico, Mexico, the U.S. and the Caribbean after hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, and the Chiapas and Puebla earthquakes.[591] In April 2020, Beyoncé donated $6 million to the National Alliance in Mental Health, UCLA and local community-based organizations in order to provide mental health and personal wellness services to essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. BeyGOOD also teamed up with local organizations to help provide resources to communities of color, including food, water, cleaning supplies, medicines and face masks.[592] The same month Beyoncé released a remix of Megan Thee Stallion's \"Savage\", with all proceeds benefiting Bread of Life Houston's COVID-19 relief efforts, which includes providing over 14 tons of food and supplies to 500 families and 100 senior citizens in Houston weekly.[593] In May 2020, Beyoncé provided 1,000 free COVID-19 tests in Houston as part of her and her mother's #IDidMyPart initiative, which was established due to the disproportionate deaths in African-American communities. Additionally, 1,000 gloves, masks, hot meals, essential vitamins, grocery vouchers and household items were provided.[594] In July 2020, Beyoncé established the Black-Owned Small Business Impact Fund in partnership with the NAACP, which offers $10,000 grants to black-owned small businesses in need following the George Floyd protests.[595] All proceeds from Beyoncé's single \"Black Parade\" were donated to the fund.[596] In September 2020, Beyoncé announced that she had donated an additional $1 million to the fund.[597] As of December 31, 2020, the fund had given 715 grants to black-owned small businesses, amounting to $7.15 million donated.[598] In October 2020, Beyoncé released a statement that she has been working with the Feminist Coalition to assist supporters of the End SARS movement in Nigeria, including covering medical costs for injured protestors, covering legal fees for arrested protestors, and providing food, emergency shelter, transportation and telecommunication means to those in need. Beyoncé also showed support for those fighting against other issues in Africa, such as the Anglophone Crisis in Cameroon, ShutItAllDown in Namibia, Zimbabwean Lives Matter in Zimbabwe and the Rape National Emergency in Liberia.[599] In December 2020, Beyoncé donated $500,000 to help alleviate the housing crisis in the U.S. caused by the cessation of the eviction moratorium, giving 100 $5,000 grants to individuals and families facing foreclosures and evictions.[600] Solo studio albums with Destiny's Child with The Carters Soundtrack albums Films starred Documentaries",

                "content": "Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter (bee-YON-say) (born September 4, 1981), known mononymously as Beyoncé, is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, actress, businesswoman, dancer and model. She is known as a lead singer of female R&B group Destiny's Child. She released her first solo album, Dangerously in Love, in 2003, when Destiny's Child was on a break. Since then, she has released six more albums, which have all produced hit singles. She has sold over 250 million records worldwide as a solo artist, and as the lead singer of the world's best-selling female group of all time, selling over 100 million records worldwide. She is the most awarded musicians in Grammys of all time, with 32 wins during her career, as well as her nominations.[6][7] Beyoncé Giselle Knowles was born at Park Plaza Hospital in Houston, Texas.[8] Her mother is Tina Knowles (née Beyincé; currently Lawson) and has Creole descent, which means she has some African and French roots. Her father is Mathew Knowles, who is African American. Knowles went to several performing arts schools, and took part in singing and dancing competitions as a child. Her younger sister, Solange, is also a musician. In her youth, she started the girl group Girls Tyme. Her father Mathew became her manager. Knowles became very famous in the late 1990s. She became the lead singer of the R&B girl group Destiny's Child. The group became the world's best-selling girl group of all time, selling over 85 million records worldwide. Destiny's Child took a break from recording music. Knowles released her solo debut album, Dangerously in Love, in 2003. Two singles from the album—\"Crazy in Love\" and \"Baby Boy\"—reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The album became one of the most successful albums of that year. Dangerously in Love was given five Grammy Awards. After Destiny's Child split, Knowles released her second album. B'Day was released in 2006, and its singles \"Déjà Vu\", \"Irreplaceable\" and \"Beautiful Liar\" reached the top ten in the United States. Her third album I Am... Sasha Fierce was released in 2008. \"If I Were a Boy\", \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\", \"Halo\" and \"Sweet Dreams\" became hit singles for Knowles. \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" became another number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100. The album earned six Grammys in 2010, the most Grammys won by a woman in one night. Only Adele would do this again at the 2012 Grammys. Her next album, 4 (2011), became her fourth number one album on the Billboard 200 chart. She became the third artist in history to have her first four albums debut at number one. Beyoncé released her fifth album Beyoncé on iTunes on December 13, 2013. The public did not know about the album before it was released. The album has fourteen songs and 17 videos.[9] It has been given good reviews. It entered the Billboard 200 at number one. This made her the first female artist in the history of the chart to have her first five albums enter the chart at the top.[10] Knowles performed \"Drunk in Love\" with JAY-Z at the 2014 Grammy Awards. She was nominated for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"Part II (On the Run)\" with JAY-Z.[11] In February 2016, Beyoncé was a guest performer at Super Bowl 50. She performed \"Formation\", the lead single from her sixth studio album, Lemonade. The performance was controversial, as it had elements of the #BlackLivesMatter movement along with influences from the Black Panthers.[12] She announced The Formation World Tour in a commercial after the Super Bowl performance. In April 2016, an hour-long film, Lemonade, was shown on HBO. After the film aired, the Lemonade album was released. The album became her best-reviewed of her career. It entered the charts at number one in the US and Canada. Lemonade features the singles \"Formation\", \"Sorry\", and \"Hold Up\". It won the Grammy Award for Best Urban Contemporary Album in 2017, while the music video for \"Formation\" won the award for Best Music Video. In 2017, Beyoncé released the promotional single \"Die with You\". She later contributed to the remix of \"Mi Gente\" by J Balvin and Willy William. This caused the song to jump to number three on the Billboard Hot 100. On December 1, 2017, an acoustic duet between Beyoncé and Ed Sheeran of Sheeran's song \"Perfect\" was released and was at the top of the iTunes charts in 32 countries.[13] The song became Beyoncé's sixth US number-one as a solo artist and her tenth number-one song in the US including songs with Destiny's Child. Knowles was featured on a remix of rapper Megan Thee Stallion's song \"Savage\"; it became Knowles’ seventh number-one song in the US.[14] On June 20, 2022, she released \"Break My Soul\", the lead single from her seventh studio album, Renaissance and the album was released on July 29, 2022. \"Break My Soul\" became her eighth solo US number-one (twelfth overall), while the album's next single, \"Cuff It\", reached number ten on the Hot 100.[15] Knowles has a three octave mezzo-soprano vocal range. Other sources state that she possesses a contralto vocal range at age of 30s. Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that her voice is \"velvety yet tart, with an insistent flutter and reserves of soul belting\". Jody Rosen notes that the hip hop era highly influenced Knowles' unique rhythmic vocal style, but also finds her quite traditionalist in her use of balladry, gospel and falsetto. Her first role in a movie was for the musical Carmen: A Hip Hopera (2001). Her first major movie was Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002). The movie Dreamgirls (2006) was nominated for two Golden Globe Awards. Her other movies Cadillac Records (2008) and Obsessed (2009) did not do so well. In 2019, she starred as Nala in the 2019 drama-live action remake The Lion King. In 2005, Knowles and her mother created a fashion line called House of Deréon. In 2016, she also introduced a fitness-wear collection called Ivy Park.[16] In 2010, she released her first perfume which she called Heat. In 2013, Knowles became H&M's new swimwear model since she gave birth to her daughter Blue Ivy just a year prior. She became a spokesperson for L'Oréal, Pepsi, Tommy Hilfiger, Nintendo, and Vizio. In 2010, Knowles was ranked first on Forbes list of the \"100 Most Powerful and Influential Musicians in the World\",[17] and second on its list of the \"100 Most Powerful and Influential Celebrities in the World\".[18] In 2012, she was named \"World's Most Beautiful Woman\" by People magazine.[19] Many of Knowles' recordings and movies were given many nominations, with many winning them. These include 32 Grammy Awards, 24 [MTV Video Music Awards], three [American Music Awards], a Billboard Millennium Award, and a star on the [Hollywood Walk of Fame] with Destiny's Child. In 2009, [Billboard (magazine)|Billboard] named her the Top Radio Songs Artist of the 2000s decade. They also ranked her 4th for Artist of the Decade.[20][21] The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), named Knowles as the Top Certified Artist of the 2000s.[22][23] In the US, she has sold over 17 million copies as of May 2014. She has sold more than 30.4 million digital singles as of January 2012.[24] Worldwide, she has sold 245 million records. This makes her one of the best-selling music artists of all time.[25] Knowles appeared on [VH1]'s 2010 list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\".[26] They ranked her third on their \"100 Greatest Women in Music\" list in 2012. In 2000, Knowles met Jay-Z and proposed her on his 38th birthday on December 4, 2007. The couple married on April 4, 2008. On January 7, 2012, she gave birth to their first daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, via natural birth in Lennox Hill Hospital, New York. Knowles is a feminist. In the February 2013 issue of GQ magazine she said, \"You know, equality is a myth, and for some reason, everyone accepts the fact that women don’t make as much money as men do. I don’t understand that. Why do we have to take a backseat? I truly believe that women should be financially independent from their men. And let’s face it, money gives men the power to run the show. It gives men the power to define value. They define what’s sexy. And men define what’s feminine. It’s ridiculous.\"[27] Knowles joined the Ban Bossy campaign in 2014.[28] In December 2013, it was revealed that she and her husband Jay-Z were longtime vegans.[29] She wrote the foreword to the book The 22-Day Revolution by trainer Marco Borges, which was released in April 2015.[30] On February 1, 2017, Knowles announced via Instagram that she was expecting twins.[31] She gave birth to a daughter, Rumi and a son, Sir on June 13, 2017 via cesarean section.[32][33]",

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Beyoncé and her husband, JAY-Z (Shawn Carter), have three children. Their eldest daughter was born in 2012 and is named Blue Ivy. Their twins, a boy and a girl, were born in 2017 and are named Sir and Rumi, respectively. Beyoncé achieved fame in the late 1990s as the lead singer of the R&B group Destiny’s Child and then launched a hugely successful solo career. Her hit solo albums included Dangerously in Love (2003), B’Day (2006), I Am…Sasha Fierce (2008), 4 (2011), Beyoncé (2013), and Lemonade (2016). By 2019 Beyoncé had won 23 Grammy Awards and was the most-nominated female artist in Grammy history, with 62 nominations. She first won the award as a member of the R&B group Destiny’s Child in 2000. Beyoncé (born September 4, 1981, Houston, Texas, U.S.) is an American singer-songwriter and actress who achieved fame in the late 1990s as the lead singer of the R&B group Destiny’s Child and then launched a hugely successful solo career. In 2023 she broke the record for most Grammy Awards won by an artist, with 32 Grammy wins over the course of her career. Beyoncé was born Beyoncé Giselle Knowles to Tina (née Beyoncé) and Mathew Knowles (divorced 2011). She has a younger sister, Solange, who also became a successful recording artist. At age nine Beyoncé formed the singing-rapping girl group Destiny’s Child (originally called Girl’s Tyme) in 1990 with childhood friends. In 1992 the group lost on the Star Search television talent show, and three years later it was dropped from a recording contract before an album had been released. In 1997 Destiny’s Child’s fortunes reversed with a Columbia recording contract and then an eponymous debut album that yielded the hit single “No, No, No Part 2.” Its follow-up album, The Writing’s on the Wall (1999), earned the group two Grammy Awards and sold more than eight million copies in the United States. Survivor (2001), the group’s third album, reached the number one spot on the Billboard 200 chart. By this time the group’s lineup, which had seen several personnel changes, was composed of Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland, and Michelle Williams. With her powerful voice and charisma, Beyoncé was clearly the leader of the group and wrote hit songs for Destiny’s Child, such as the saucy “Bootylicious.” Eventually, the group parted ways to pursue individual projects. Beyoncé used her songwriting talents to pen her first solo album, Dangerously in Love (2003). The album debuted to rave reviews, and, aided by the exuberant single “Crazy in Love,” which features rapper Jay-Z, it topped charts around the world. In 2004 Beyoncé won five Grammy Awards, including best contemporary R&B album and best female R&B vocal performance. Destiny’s Child reunited in 2004 to release Destiny Fulfilled. While generally not as acclaimed as the group’s previous efforts, the album sold more than seven million copies worldwide and spawned several hit singles. The trio embarked on a world tour in 2005, during which they announced that the group would officially disband. That same year they released #1’s, a collection of well-known songs and number one hits. In 2006 Beyoncé released her second solo studio album, B’Day, which features several coproducers, including the hit-making duo the Neptunes. Although much of the album carried echoes of 1970s-style funk, the pop ballad “Irreplaceable” became its most successful single. In 2008 she and Jay-Z married, and the union made them one of the top-earning couples in the entertainment industry. Later that year Beyoncé released the double album I Am…Sasha Fierce. Whereas the first half (I Am) captures an introspective mood, the second (Sasha Fierce) contains songs better suited to the dance floor. The album as a whole generated several hits, including the assertive “Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It),” and it contributed to Beyoncé’s dominance of the 2010 Grammy Awards. Her six awards, which included those for song of the year, best female pop vocal performance, and best contemporary R&B album, amounted to the most Grammys collected by a female artist in a single night. (The record was matched by pop singer Adele in 2012.) Days after a triumphant headlining performance at England’s Glastonbury Festival, Beyoncé released 4 (2011), a genre-bending mix of ballads and dance tracks that evokes influences ranging from Motown-era torch songs to the audio collages of rapper M.I.A. In early 2013 Destiny’s Child reunited for a halftime appearance at the Super Bowl and released a new song, “Nuclear.” Shortly thereafter Beyoncé collected a Grammy for her single “Love on Top.” She returned later in the year with the confidently sensuous and expressive Beyoncé, which boasts brand-name producers and appearances from, among others, the Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and the singer’s toddler daughter, Blue Ivy. The record, initially offered exclusively on iTunes, was promoted as a “visual album,” with music videos made to accompany each track. The single “Drunk in Love,” which features Jay-Z, was awarded several Grammys, including best R&B song. On the expansive and musically variegated Lemonade (2016), Beyoncé focused on themes of betrayal and perseverance. Conceived as another visual album, it debuted as an HBO television special. Lemonade attracted considerable acclaim, and it netted Beyoncé two Grammys, including a best music-video award for the anthemic “Formation.” In 2018 Beyoncé and Jay-Z released a collaborative album, Everything Is Love, credited to the Carters, and it took the Grammy for best urban contemporary album. That same year Beyoncé became the first Black woman to headline the Coachella Valley Festival in Indio, California. Her highly acclaimed performance, which featured marching bands from historically Black colleges, was the subject of Homecoming, a Netflix documentary and live album released in 2019. Although Beyoncé worked on a number of projects between studio albums, fans were left waiting for a new solo album. In 2022 she finally delivered with act i: RENAISSANCE. It received four Grammys, including best dance/electronic music album, and with those awards, Beyoncé surpassed classical music conductor Georg Solti for the most Grammy wins (32). Her world concert tour in 2023 broke the record, previously held by Madonna, for the highest grossing concert tour by a female artist. It also broke the record for the highest grossing tour of all time, until it was surpassed by Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour, which began in 2023. In February 2024 Beyoncé appeared in a commercial during the Super Bowl telecast to announce that she was releasing new music. Immediately after the game, she dropped two singles, “Texas Hold ’Em” and “16 Carriages,” on the music streaming service Tidal. Both songs feature a country music sound, leading her fans to guess that her new album, which she teased right after the Super Bowl on her Instagram page, would be a country album. The following month she revealed the album’s name, Cowboy Carter, confirming her fans’ guess. In the meantime, “Texas Hold ’Em” went to number one on the Billboard country chart, marking the first time in history that a Black woman had topped that chart. It was not her first foray into country music; in 2016 she performed her song “Daddy Lessons” with the Dixie Chicks (now known as the Chicks) at the Country Music Awards. In another Instagram post, Beyoncé revealed that the backlash she received after that performance spurred her to “dive into the history of Country music” as a future project. She also asserted, “This ain’t a Country album. This is a ‘Beyoncé album.’ ” The album’s release in late March prompted a long-overdue discourse about the African American roots of country music. Cowboy Carter’s impressive roster of guest artists includes singers Miley Cyrus and Linda Martell, folk musician Rhiannon Giddens, and singer-songwriters Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson. Parton’s classic song “Jolene” is reimagined with new lyrics by Beyoncé, and country singer Tanner Adell is among several vocalists who join in on a cover of the Beatles’ “Blackbird.” In 2001 Beyoncé made her acting debut in the television movie Carmen: A Hip Hopera, which aired on MTV. Her role as Foxxy Cleopatra in Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002) made her a film star and led to parts in The Fighting Temptations (2003) and The Pink Panther (2006). In 2006 she played Deena Jones in Dreamgirls, the film adaptation of the 1981 Broadway musical about a 1960s singing group. Beyoncé’s performance was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and her song “Listen” for an Academy Award. She later starred in Cadillac Records (2008), in which she portrayed singer Etta James, and the thriller Obsessed (2009) before providing the voice of a fairylike forest queen in the animated Epic (2013). For the 2019 remake of Disney’s The Lion King, Beyoncé voiced the character of Nala and performed several songs on the soundtrack, including “Spirit,” an original song she cowrote, and a rendition of “Can You Feel the Love Tonight.” She also concurrently released an album inspired by the movie, The Lion King: The Gift. Songs from that record were later featured in the visual album Black Is King (2020), which aired on the streaming service Disney+. For the single “Black Parade,” Beyoncé earned the Grammy for best R&B performance in 2021. That year she received three other awards to set the record for most Grammys (28) won by a female artist, surpassing bluegrass musician and singer Alison Krauss. Beyoncé later cowrote and performed “Be Alive” for the film King Richard (2021), and it received an Oscar nomination for best original song.",
