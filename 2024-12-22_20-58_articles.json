                "title": "National Football League - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The National Football League (NFL) is a professional American football league composed of 32 teams, divided equally between the American Football Conference (AFC) and the National Football Conference (NFC). The NFL is one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada and the highest professional level of American football in the world.[5] Each NFL season begins annually with a three-week preseason in August, followed by the 18-week regular season, which runs from early September to early January, with each team playing 17 games and having one bye week. Following the conclusion of the regular season, seven teams from each conference, including four division winners and three wild card teams, advance to the playoffs, a single-elimination tournament, which culminates in the Super Bowl, played in early February between the winners of the AFC and NFC championship games. The NFL was formed in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association (APFA) before renaming itself the National Football League for the 1922 season. After initially determining champions through end-of-season standings, a playoff system was implemented in 1933 that culminated with the NFL Championship Game until 1966. Following an agreement to merge the NFL with the rival American Football League (AFL), the Super Bowl was first held in 1967 to determine a champion between the best teams from the two leagues and has remained as the final game of each NFL season since the merger was completed in 1970.[6] The NFL is the wealthiest professional sports league in the world by revenue,[7] and the sports league with the most valuable teams.[8] The NFL also has the highest average attendance (67,591) of any professional sports league in the world[9] and is the most popular sports league in the United States.[10] The Super Bowl is also among the most-watched sporting events in the world,[11] with the individual games accounting for many of the most watched television programs in American history and all occupying the top five of Nielsen's all-time most-watched U.S. television broadcasts by 2015.[12] The NFL is headquartered in Midtown Manhattan. The Green Bay Packers hold the most combined NFL championships with thirteen, winning nine titles before the Super Bowl era and four Super Bowls afterwards. Since the creation of the Super Bowl, the New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers are tied for the most Super Bowl victories at six each. The reigning league champions are the Kansas City Chiefs. On August 20, 1920, a meeting was held by representatives of the Akron Pros, Canton Bulldogs, Cleveland Indians, and Dayton Triangles at the Jordan and Hupmobile auto showroom in Canton, Ohio.[13] This meeting resulted in the formation of the American Professional Football Conference (APFC), a group who, according to the Canton Evening Repository, intended to \"raise the standard of professional football in every way possible, to eliminate bidding for players between rival clubs and to secure cooperation in the formation of schedules\".[14] A second meeting was held on September 17, 1920, with representatives from teams within four states: Akron, Canton, Cleveland, and Dayton from Ohio; the Hammond Pros and Muncie Flyers from Indiana; the Rochester Jeffersons from New York; and the Rock Island Independents, Decatur Staleys, and Racine (Chicago) Cardinals from Illinois.[15][16] The league was renamed to the American Professional Football Association (APFA).[14] The league elected Jim Thorpe as its first president, and consisted of 14 teams (the Buffalo All-Americans, Chicago Tigers, Columbus Panhandles and Detroit Heralds joined the league during the year). The Massillon Tigers from Massillon, Ohio was also at the September 17 meeting, but did not field a team in 1920. Only two of these teams, the Decatur Staleys (now the Chicago Bears) and the Chicago Cardinals (now the Arizona Cardinals), remain in the NFL.[17] Although the league did not maintain official standings for its 1920 inaugural season and teams played schedules that included non-league opponents, the APFA awarded the Akron Pros the championship by virtue of their 8–0–3 record.[18] The first event occurred on September 26, 1920, when the Rock Island Independents defeated the non-league St. Paul Ideals 48–0 at Douglas Park.[13][19] On October 3, 1920, the first full week of league play occurred.[20][21] The following season resulted in the Chicago Staleys controversially winning the title over the Buffalo All-Americans.[22] On June 24, 1922, the APFA changed its name to the National Football League (NFL).[23][24] In 1932, the season ended with the Chicago Bears (6–1–6) and the Portsmouth Spartans (6–1–4) tied for first in the league standings.[25] At the time, teams were ranked on a single table and the team with the highest winning percentage (not including ties, which were not counted towards the standings) at the end of the season was declared the champion; the only tiebreaker was that in the event of a tie if two teams played twice in a season, the result of the second game determined the title (the source of the 1921 controversy). This method had been used since the league's creation in 1920, but no situation had been encountered where two teams were tied for first. The league quickly determined that a playoff game between Chicago and Portsmouth was needed to decide the league's champion. The teams were originally scheduled to play the playoff game, officially a regular-season game that would count towards the regular season standings, at Wrigley Field in Chicago, but a combination of heavy snow and extreme cold forced the game to be moved indoors to Chicago Stadium, which did not have a regulation-size football field. Playing with altered rules to accommodate the smaller playing field, the Bears won the game 9–0 and thus won the championship. Fan interest in the de facto championship game led the NFL, beginning in 1933, to split into two divisions with a championship game to be played between the division champions.[26] The 1934 season also marked the first of twelve seasons in which African Americans were absent from the league. The de facto ban was rescinded in 1946, following public pressure and coinciding with the removal of a similar ban in Major League Baseball.[27] The NFL was always the largest professional football league in the United States; it nevertheless faced numerous rival professional leagues through the 1930s and 1940s. Rival leagues included at least three separate American Football Leagues and the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), on top of various regional leagues of varying caliber. Three NFL teams trace their histories to these rival leagues; the Los Angeles Rams who came from a 1936 iteration of the American Football League, and the Cleveland Browns and San Francisco 49ers, both from the AAFC. By the 1950s, the NFL had an effective monopoly on professional football in the United States; its only competition in North America was the professional Canadian football circuit, which formally became the Canadian Football League (CFL) in 1958. With Canadian football being a different football code than the American game, the CFL established a niche market in Canada and still survives as an independent league. A new professional league, the fourth American Football League (AFL), began to play in 1960. The upstart AFL began to challenge the established NFL in popularity, gaining lucrative television contracts and engaging in a bidding war with the NFL for free agents and draft picks. The two leagues announced a merger on June 8, 1966, to take full effect in 1970. In the meantime, the leagues would hold a common draft and championship game. The game, the Super Bowl, was held four times before the merger, with the NFL winning Super Bowl I and Super Bowl II, and the AFL winning Super Bowl III and Super Bowl IV.[28] After the league merged, it was reorganized into two conferences: the National Football Conference (NFC), consisting of most of the pre-merger NFL teams, and the American Football Conference (AFC), consisting of all of the AFL teams as well as three pre-merger NFL teams.[29] Today, the NFL is the most popular sports league in North America[30] – with much of the league's growth and popularity attributable to former Commissioner Pete Rozelle, who led the league from 1960 to 1989. Overall annual attendance increased from 3 million at the beginning of his tenure to 17 million by the end of his tenure, and 400 million global viewers watched 1989's Super Bowl XXIII.[31] The NFL established NFL Properties in 1963. The league's licensing wing, NFL Properties, earns the league billions of dollars annually; Rozelle's tenure also marked the creation of NFL Charities and a national partnership with United Way.[31] Paul Tagliabue was elected as commissioner to succeed Rozelle; his 17-year tenure, which ended in 2006, was marked by large increases in television contracts and the addition of four expansion teams,[32] as well as the introduction of league initiatives to increase the number of minorities in league and team management roles.[33] The league's current Commissioner, Roger Goodell, has focused on reducing the number of illegal hits and making the sport safer, mainly through fining or suspending players who break rules.[34] These actions are among many the NFL is taking to reduce concussions and improve player safety.[35] Prior to 2021, the NFL had utilized race-based adjustments of dementia claims in the $1 billion settlement of concussion claims, which had been criticized by critics before the NFL decided to end what was called \"race-norming\".[36][37] On May 21, 2024, the NFL announced the NFL Source initiative, aimed at increasing the number of minority- and women-owned businesses that work with the league throughout the year.[38] NFL Source will be mandatory for teams that host major events, such as the Super Bowl and the NFL Draft, and their organizing committees, but will be optional for other contracts at the team level.[38] The NFL will partner with the U.S. Black Chambers, Inc to help local businesses across the country obtain the certifications necessary to do business with the league in furtherance of its efforts to increase partnerships with certified and underrepresented businesses that are 51% owned and operated or led by a veteran, woman, minority, person with disabilities or LGBTQ+.[39] In 2015, a class-action lawsuit was filed on behalf of NFL Sunday Ticket subscribers, alleging that the NFL, its member teams, its broadcast partners, and DirecTV engaged in a conspiracy to violate antitrust law, by granting DirecTV exclusive rights to sell the Sunday Ticket product, thereby restricting competition and forcing viewers to pay super competitive prices to view out-of-market games.[40][41] On June 27, 2024, a jury in Los Angeles found that the NFL had violated antitrust law in setting the price of the Sunday ticket package and ordered a penalty totaling more than $4.7 billion. With triple damages allowed under federal antitrust laws, the NFL could ultimately be liable for $14.39 billion. The league said it would ask the judge to set the verdict aside then appeal the verdict if needed.[42] From 1920 to 1934, the NFL did not have a set number of games for teams to play, instead setting a minimum. The league mandated a twelve-game regular season for each team beginning in 1935, later shortening this to eleven games in 1937 and ten games in 1943, mainly due to World War II. After the war ended, the number of games returned to eleven games in 1946, and later back to twelve in 1947. The NFL went to a 14-game schedule in 1961, which it retained until switching to a 16-game schedule in 1978.[43] In March 2021, the NFL officially adopted a 17-game schedule after gaining the agreement of the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA).[44] Having an odd number of games in the schedule will give half the teams nine games as the home team, while half the teams have only eight home games. To minimize the perceived benefit on competition of having more home games, the extra home game will be rotated between the two conferences each year. This is because playoff berths are allocated at the conference level, so all teams within the conference will have played the same number of home games. The NFL operated in a two-conference system from 1933 to 1966, where the champions of each conference would meet in the NFL Championship Game. If two teams tied for the conference lead, they would meet in a one-game playoff to determine the conference champion. In 1967, the NFL expanded from 15 teams to 16 teams. Instead of just evening out the conferences by adding the expansion New Orleans Saints to the seven-member Western Conference, the NFL realigned the conferences and split each into two four-team divisions. The four division champions would meet in the NFL playoffs, a two-round playoff.[45] The NFL also operated the Playoff Bowl (officially the Bert Bell Benefit Bowl) from 1960 to 1969. Effectively, a third-place game, pitting the two conference runners-up against each other, the league considers Playoff Bowls to have been exhibitions rather than playoff games. The league discontinued the Playoff Bowl in 1970 due to its perception as a game for losers.[46] Following the addition of the former AFL teams into the NFL in 1970, the NFL split into two conferences with three divisions each. The expanded league, now with twenty-six teams,[29] would also feature an expanded eight-team playoff, the participants being the three division champions from each conference as well as one 'wild card' team (the team with the best win percentage that did not win its division) from each conference. In 1978, the league added a second wild card team from each conference, bringing the total number of playoff teams to ten, and a further two wild card teams were added in 1990 to bring the total to twelve. When the NFL expanded to 32 teams in 2002, the league realigned, changing the division structure from three divisions in each conference to four divisions in each conference. As each division champion gets a playoff bid, the number of wild card teams from each conference dropped from three to two.[47] The playoffs expanded again in 2020, adding two more wild card teams to bring the total to 14 playoff teams.[48] The NFL consists of 32 teams divided into two conferences of 16 teams each. Each conference is divided into four divisions of four teams each. During the regular season, each team is allowed a maximum of 55 players on its roster; only 48 of these may be active (eligible to play) on game days.[49] Each team can also have a sixteen-player practice squad separate from its main roster.[50] Each NFL club is granted a franchise, the league's authorization for the team to operate in its home city. This franchise covers 'Home Territory' (the 75 miles surrounding the city limits, or, if the team is within 100 miles of another league city, half the distance between the two cities) and 'Home Marketing Area' (Home Territory plus the rest of the state the club operates in, as well as the area the team operates its training camp in for the duration of the camp). Each NFL member has the exclusive right to host professional football games inside its Home Territory and the exclusive right to advertise, promote, and host events in its Home Marketing Area. There are a couple of exceptions to this rule, mostly relating to teams with close proximity to each other: teams that operate in the same city (e.g. New York City and Los Angeles) or the same state (e.g. California, Florida, and Texas) share the rights to the city's Home Territory and the state's Home Marketing Area, respectively.[51] According to Forbes, the Dallas Cowboys, at approximately US$8 billion, are the most valuable NFL franchise and the most valuable sports team in the world.[52] 26 of the 32 NFL teams rank among the Top 50 most valuable sports teams in the world;[8] and 16 of the NFL's owners are listed on the Forbes 400, the most of any sports league or organization.[53] At the corporate level, the National Football League considers itself a trade association made up of and financed by its 32 member teams.[64] Up until 2015, the league was an unincorporated nonprofit 501(c)(6) association.[65] Section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code provides an exemption from federal income taxation for \"Business leagues, chambers of commerce, real-estate boards, boards of trade, or professional football leagues (whether or not administering a pension fund for football players), not organized for profit and no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual.\"[66] In contrast, each individual team, with the exception of the non-profit Green Bay Packers,[67] is subject to tax because they make a profit.[68] In 2015, the NFL gave up its tax-exempt status following public criticism; in a letter to the club owners, Commissioner Roger Goodell labeled it a \"distraction\", saying \"the effects of the tax-exempt status of the league office have been mischaracterized repeatedly in recent years… Every dollar of income generated through television rights fees, licensing agreements, sponsorships, ticket sales, and other means is earned by the 32 clubs and is taxable there. This will remain the case even when the league office and Management Council file returns as taxable entities, and the change in filing status will make no material difference to our business.\" As a result, the league office might owe around US$10 million in income taxes, but it is no longer required to disclose the salaries of its executive officers.[69] The league has three defined officers: the commissioner, secretary, and treasurer. Each conference has one defined officer, the president, which is essentially an honorary position with few powers and mostly ceremonial duties, including awarding the conference championship trophy. The commissioner is elected by the affirmative vote of two-thirds or eighteen (whichever is greater) of the members of the league, while the president of each conference is elected by an affirmative vote of three-fourths or 10 of the conference members.[70] The commissioner appoints the secretary and treasurer and has broad authority in disputes between clubs, players, coaches, and employees. He is the \"principal executive officer\"[71] of the NFL and also has authority in hiring league employees, negotiating television contracts, disciplining individuals that own part or all of an NFL team, clubs, or employed individuals of an NFL club if they have violated league by-laws or committed \"conduct detrimental to the welfare of the League or professional football\".[71] The commissioner can, in the event of misconduct by a party associated with the league, suspend individuals, hand down a fine of up to US$500,000, cancel contracts with the league, and award or strip teams of draft picks.[71] In extreme cases, the commissioner can offer recommendations to the NFL's executive committee, up to and including the \"cancellation or forfeiture\"[71] of a club's franchise or any other action, he deems necessary. The commissioner can also issue sanctions up to and including a lifetime ban from the league if an individual connected to the NFL has bet on games or failed to notify the league of conspiracies or plans to bet on or fix games.[71] The current Commissioner of the National Football League is Roger Goodell, who was elected in 2006 after Paul Tagliabue, the previous commissioner, retired.[72] The NFL season format consists of a three-week preseason, an 18-week regular season (each team plays 17 games), and a 14-team single-elimination playoff culminating in the Super Bowl, the league's championship game. The NFL preseason begins with the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game, played at Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium in Canton.[73] Each NFL team is required to schedule three preseason games. NFC teams must play at least two of these at home in odd numbered years and AFC teams must play at least two at home in even numbered years. However, the teams involved in the Hall of Fame game, as well as any team that played in an American Bowl game, play four preseason games.[74] Preseason games are exhibition matches and do not count towards regular-season totals.[75] Because the preseason does not count towards standings, teams generally do not focus on winning games; instead, they are used by coaches to evaluate their teams and by players to show their performance, both to their current team and to other teams if they get cut.[76] The quality of preseason games has been criticized by some fans, who dislike having to pay full price for exhibition games,[77] as well as by some players and coaches, who dislike the risk of injury the games have, while others have felt the preseason is a necessary part of the NFL season.[76][77] Currently, the 14 opponents each team faces over the 17-game regular season schedule are set using a predetermined formula:[78] The league runs an 18-week, 272-game regular season.[79] Since 2021, the season has begun the week after Labor Day (the first Monday in September) and concluded the week after New Year.[80] The opening game of the season is normally a home game on a Thursday for the league's defending champion.[81] Most NFL games are played on Sundays, with a Monday night game typically held at least once a week and Thursday night games occurring on most weeks as well.[81] NFL games are not normally played on Fridays or Saturdays until late in the regular season, as federal law prohibits professional football leagues from competing with college or high school football. Because high school and college teams typically play games on Friday and Saturday, respectively, the NFL cannot hold games on those days until the Friday before the third Saturday in December. While Saturday games late in the season are common, the league rarely holds Friday games, the most recent one being on Christmas Day in 2020.[82] NFL games are rarely scheduled for Tuesday or Wednesday, and those days have only been used three times since 1948: in 2010, when a Sunday game was rescheduled to Tuesday due to a blizzard; in 2012, when the Kickoff game was moved from Thursday to Wednesday to avoid conflict with the Democratic National Convention;[83][84] and in 2020, when a game was postponed from Sunday to Tuesday due to players testing positive for COVID-19.[85] NFL regular season match-ups are determined according to a scheduling formula. Within a division, all four teams play 14 out of their 17 games against common opponents or each other– two games (home and away) are played against the other three teams in the division, while one game is held against all the members of a division from the NFC and a division from the AFC as determined by a rotating cycle (three years for the conference the team is in, and four years in the conference they are not in). Two of the other games are intraconference games, determined by the standings of the previous year – for example, if a team finishes first in its division, it will play two other first-place teams in its conference, while a team that finishes last would play two other last-place teams in the conference. The final game is an inter-conference based on a rotating cycle and determined by previous season's standings.[86] In total, each team plays 17 games and has one bye week, where it does not play a game.[87] Although a team's home and away opponents are known by the end of the previous year's regular season, the exact dates and times for NFL games are not determined until much later because the league has to account for, among other things, the Major League Baseball postseason and local events that could pose a scheduling conflict with NFL games. During the 2010 season, over 500,000 potential schedules were created by computers, 5,000 of which were considered \"playable schedules\" and were reviewed by the NFL's scheduling team. After arriving at what they felt was the best schedule out of the group, nearly 50 more potential schedules were developed to try to ensure that the chosen schedule would be the best possible one.[88] Following the conclusion of the regular season, the NFL Playoffs, a 14-team single-elimination tournament, is then held. Seven teams are selected from each conference: the winners of each of the four divisions as well as three wild card teams (the three remaining teams with the best overall record, with tiebreakers in the event of two or more teams having the same record). These teams are seeded according to overall record and tiebreakers, with the division champions always ranking higher than the wild card teams.[89] The top team (seeded one) from each conference are awarded a bye week, while the remaining six teams (seeded 2–7) from each conference compete in the first round of the playoffs, the Wild Card round, with the 2-seed competing against the 7-seed, the 3-seed competing against the 6-seed and the 4-seed competing against the 5-seed. The winners of the Wild Card round advance to the Divisional Round, which matches the lower seeded team against the 1-seed and the two remaining teams against each other. The winners of those games then compete in the Conference Championships, with the higher remaining seed hosting the lower remaining seed. The AFC and NFC champions then compete in the Super Bowl to determine the league champion. The only other postseason event hosted by the NFL is the Pro Bowl, the league's all-star game. Since 2009, the Pro Bowl has been held the week before the Super Bowl; in previous years, the game was held the week following the Super Bowl, but in an effort to boost ratings, the game was moved to the week before.[90] Because of this, players from the teams participating in the Super Bowl are exempt from participating in the game. The Pro Bowl is not considered as competitive as a regular-season game because the biggest concern of teams is to avoid injuries to the players.[91] The National Football League has used three different trophies to honor its champion over its existence. The first trophy, the Brunswick-Balke Collender Cup, was donated to the NFL (then APFA) in 1920 by the Brunswick-Balke Collender Corporation. The trophy, the appearance of which is only known by its description as a \"silver loving cup\", was intended to be a traveling trophy and not to become permanent until a team had won at least three titles. The league awarded it to the Akron Pros, champions of the inaugural 1920 season; however, the trophy was discontinued and its current whereabouts are unknown.[92] A second trophy, the Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy, was issued by the NFL from 1934 to 1967. The trophy's namesake, Ed Thorp, was a referee in the league and a friend to many early league owners; upon his death in 1934, the league created the trophy to honor him. In addition to the main trophy, which would be in the possession of the current league champion, the league issued a smaller replica trophy to each champion, who would maintain permanent control over it. The current location of the Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy, long thought to be lost,[93] is believed to be possessed by the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame.[94] The current trophy of the NFL is the Vince Lombardi Trophy. The Super Bowl trophy was officially renamed in 1970 after Vince Lombardi, who as head coach led the Green Bay Packers to victories in the first two Super Bowls.[95] Unlike the previous trophies, a new Vince Lombardi Trophy is issued to each year's champion, who maintains permanent control of it. Lombardi Trophies are made by Tiffany & Co. out of sterling silver and are worth anywhere from US$25,000 to US$300,000.[96] Additionally, each player on the winning team as well as coaches and personnel are awarded Super Bowl rings to commemorate their victory. The winning team chooses the company that makes the rings; each ring design varies, with the NFL mandating certain ring specifications (which have a degree of room for deviation), in addition to requiring the Super Bowl logo be on at least one side of the ring.[97] The losing team are also awarded rings, which must be no more than half as valuable as the winners' rings, but those are almost never worn.[98] The conference champions receive trophies for their achievement. The champions of the NFC receive the George Halas Trophy,[99] named after Chicago Bears founder George Halas, who is also considered one of the co-founders of the NFL. The AFC champions receive the Lamar Hunt Trophy,[100] named after Lamar Hunt, the founder of the Kansas City Chiefs and the principal founder of the American Football League. Players on the winning team also receive a conference championship ring.[101][102] The NFL recognizes a number of awards for its players and coaches at its annual NFL Honors presentation. The most prestigious award is the AP Most Valuable Player (MVP) award.[103] Other major awards include the AP Offensive Player of the Year, AP Defensive Player of the Year, AP Comeback Player of the Year, and the AP Offensive and Defensive Rookie of the Year awards.[104] Another prestigious award is the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award, which recognizes a player's off-field work in addition to his on-field performance.[105] The NFL Coach of the Year award is the highest coaching award.[106] The NFL also gives out weekly awards such as the FedEx Air & Ground NFL Players of the Week[107] and the Pepsi MAX NFL Rookie of the Week awards.[108] In the United States, the National Football League is televised on eight networks across seven media partners: ESPN/ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, Prime Video, Netflix, and NFL Network. The league offers its media rights in packages of games to prospective media partners. The packages can vary depending on conference, broadcast time slot, or both. CBS televises afternoon games from the AFC package, and Fox carries afternoon games from the NFC package. These afternoon games are not carried on all affiliates, as multiple games are being played at once; each network affiliate is assigned one game per time slot, according to a complicated set of rules.[109] Since 2011, the league has reserved the right to give Sunday games that, under the contract, would normally air on one network to the other network (known as \"flexible scheduling\").[110] The only way to legally watch a regionally televised game not being carried on the local network affiliates is to purchase NFL Sunday Ticket, the league's out-of-market sports package, which is available through YouTube TV starting with the 2023 season.[111] The league also provides NFL RedZone, an omnibus telecast that cuts to the most relevant plays in each game, live as they happen. In addition to the regional games, the league also has packages of telecasts, mostly in prime time, that are carried nationwide. NBC broadcasts the primetime Sunday Night Football package, which includes the Thursday NFL Kickoff game that starts the regular season and a primetime Thanksgiving Day game. ESPN is the main broadcaster of the Monday Night Football package with ABC airing select games either exclusively or as a simulcast with ESPN. Amazon, through their Prime Video streaming service, is the exclusive carrier of the Thursday Night Football package. NFL Network, a U.S. pay cable channel owned by the league itself, broadcasts select games under the NFL Network Exclusive Game Series banner. Games under this banner usually consist of NFL International Series games and select Saturday games. In 2023, the NFL occupied the top three rates for a 30-second advertisement: $882,079 for Sunday Night Football, $562,524 for Monday Night Football, and $440,523 for Thursday Night Football.[112] The league, in recent years, has expanded their televised broadcasts to over-the-top streaming services. Since 2022, Amazon holds the exclusive rights to broadcast the Thursday Night Football package.[113] Prior to then, Amazon streamed games from the same package as part of a tri-cast model that saw games aired on broadcast television (initially through CBS and NBC, then later with Fox), cable television (through NFL Network), and digital streaming (through Prime Video).[114][115][116] Amazon has also streamed games for free on Twitch since 2018.[116] CBS streams its AFC package games on Paramount+ as a simulcast with its CBS broadcasts.[117][118] NBC streams Sunday Night Football and select exclusive games on Peacock.[117][119][120] ESPN streams its games on ESPN+ in simulcast with the broadcasts on ESPN or ABC.[117][121] ESPN also holds exclusive rights to stream one Sunday morning international game on ESPN+.[121] Beginning in 2024, Netflix holds the global streaming rights for at least one Christmas Day game every season as part of a three-year deal.[122] The Super Bowl television rights are rotated on a four-year basis between CBS, Fox, NBC, and ESPN/ABC. The NFL's most recent contract negotiation for the media rights deal was announced on March 18, 2021, to take effect beginning in the 2023 season. The deal renewed previous rights agreements made by the NFL and each of its network partners to air their respective game packages, while awarding Amazon the Thursday Night Football package. ESPN/ABC is set to return to the Super Bowl broadcast rotation and will broadcast the Super Bowl on U.S. television in 2027, 21 years after airing its last Super Bowl, Super Bowl XL. Digital and streaming distribution was expanded to allow CBS, NBC, and ESPN/ABC to stream games on their respective over-the-top streaming services. For each of the packages the respective network partners currently hold, ESPN/ABC is paying US$2.7 billion a year; CBS, Fox, and NBC are each paying more than US$2 billion a year; and Amazon is paying US$1 billion a year. The current deal runs through the 2033 season.[117][123][124] The league also has deals with Spanish-language broadcasters NBC Universo, Fox Deportes, and ESPN Deportes, which air Spanish language dubs of their respective English-language sister networks' games.[125][126] The league's contracts do not cover preseason games, which individual teams are free to sell to local stations directly; a minority of preseason games are distributed among the league's national television partners. Through the 2014 season, the NFL had a blackout policy in which games were 'blacked out' on local television in the home team's area if the home stadium was not sold out. Clubs could elect to set this requirement at only 85%, but they would have to give more ticket revenue to the visiting team; teams could also request a specific exemption from the NFL for the game. The vast majority of NFL games were not blacked out; only 6% of games were blacked out during the 2011 season,[127] and only two games were blacked out in 2013 and none in 2014.[128] The NFL announced in March 2015 that it would suspend its blackout policy for at least the 2015 season.[128] According to Nielsen, the NFL regular season since 2012 was watched by at least 200 million individuals, accounting for 80% of all television households in the United States and 69% of all potential viewers in the United States. NFL regular season games accounted for 31 out of the top 32 most-watched programs in the fall season and an NFL game ranked as the most-watched television show in all 17 weeks of the regular season. At the local level, NFL games were the highest-ranked shows in NFL markets 92% of the time.[129] Super Bowls account for the 22 most-watched programs (based on total audience) in US history, including a record 167 million people that watched Super Bowl XLVIII, the conclusion to the 2013 season.[130] In addition to radio networks run by each NFL team, select NFL games are broadcast nationally by Westwood One (known as Dial Global for the 2012 season). These games are broadcast on over 500 networks, giving all NFL markets access to each primetime game. The NFL's deal with Westwood One was extended in 2012 and continued through 2017.[131] Other NFL games are nationally distributed by Compass Media Networks and Sports USA Radio Network under contracts with individual teams. Some broadcasting innovations have either been introduced or popularized during NFL telecasts. Among them, the Skycam camera system was used for the first time in a live telecast, at a 1984 preseason NFL game in San Diego between the Chargers and 49ers, and televised by CBS.[132] Commentator John Madden famously used a telestrator during games between the early 1980s to the mid-2000s, boosting the device's popularity.[133] Each April (excluding 2014 when it took place in May), the NFL holds a draft of college players. The draft consists of seven rounds, with each of the 32 clubs getting one pick in each round.[134] The draft order for non-playoff teams is determined by regular-season record; among playoff teams, teams are first ranked by the furthest round of the playoffs they reached, and then are ranked by regular-season record. For example, any team that reached the divisional round will be given a higher pick than any team that reached the conference championships, but will be given a lower pick than any team that did not make the divisional round. The Super Bowl champion always drafts last, and the losing team from the Super Bowl always drafts next-to-last.[135] All potential draftees must be at least three years removed from high school in order to be eligible for the draft.[136] Underclassmen that have met that criterion to be eligible for the draft must write an application to the NFL by January 15 renouncing their remaining college eligibility.[137] Clubs can trade away picks for future draft picks, but cannot trade the rights to players they have selected in previous drafts.[138] Aside from the seven picks each club gets, compensatory draft picks are given to teams that have lost more compensatory free agents than they have gained. These are spread out from rounds 3 to 7, and a total of 32 are given.[139] Clubs are required to make their selection within a certain period of time, the exact time depending on which round the pick is made in. If they fail to do so on time, the clubs behind them can begin to select their players in order, but they do not lose the pick outright. This happened in the 2003 draft, when the Minnesota Vikings failed to make their selection on time. The Jacksonville Jaguars and Carolina Panthers were able to make their picks before the Vikings were able to use theirs.[140] Selected players are only allowed to negotiate contracts with the team that picked them, but if they choose not to sign they become eligible for the next year's draft.[141] Under the current collective bargaining contract, all contracts to drafted players must be four-year deals with a club option for a fifth. Contracts themselves are limited to a certain amount of money, depending on the exact draft pick the player was selected with.[142] Players who were draft eligible but not picked in the draft are free to sign with any club.[134] The NFL operates several other drafts in addition to the NFL draft. The league holds a supplemental draft annually. Clubs submit emails to the league stating the player they wish to select and the round they will do so, and the team with the highest bid wins the rights to that player. The exact order is determined by a lottery held before the draft, and a successful bid for a player will result in the team forfeiting the rights to its pick in the equivalent round of the next NFL draft.[143] Players are only eligible for the supplemental draft after being granted a petition for special eligibility.[144] The league holds expansion drafts, the most recent happening in 2002 when the Houston Texans began play as an expansion team.[145] Other drafts held by the league include an allocation draft in 1950 to allocate players from several teams that played in the dissolved All-America Football Conference[146] and a supplemental draft in 1984 to give NFL teams the rights to players who had been eligible for the main draft but had not been drafted because they had signed contracts with the United States Football League or Canadian Football League.[147] Like the other major sports leagues in the United States, the NFL maintains protocol for a disaster draft. In the event of a 'near disaster' (less than 15 players killed or disabled) that caused the club to lose a quarterback, they could draft one from a team with at least three quarterbacks. In the event of a 'disaster' (15 or more players killed or disabled) that results in a club's season being canceled, a restocking draft would be held. Neither of these protocols has ever had to be implemented.[148] Free agents in the National Football League are divided into restricted free agents, who have three accrued seasons and whose current contract has expired, and unrestricted free agents, who have four or more accrued seasons and whose contract has expired. An accrued season is defined as \"six or more regular-season games on a club's active/inactive, reserved/injured or reserve/physically unable to perform lists\".[149] Restricted free agents are allowed to negotiate with other clubs besides their former club, but the former club has the right to match any offer. If they choose not to, they are compensated with draft picks. Unrestricted free agents are free to sign with any club, and no compensation is owed if they sign with a different club.[149] Clubs are given one franchise tag to offer to any unrestricted free agent. The franchise tag is a one-year deal that pays the player 120% of his previous contract or no less than the average of the five highest-paid players at his position, whichever is greater. There are two types of franchise tags: exclusive tags, which do not allow the player to negotiate with other clubs, and non-exclusive tags, which allow the player to negotiate with other clubs but gives his former club the right to match any offer and two first-round draft picks if they decline to match it.[150] Clubs also have the option to use a transition tag, which is similar to the non-exclusive franchise tag but offers no compensation if the former club refuses to match the offer.[151] Due to that stipulation, the transition tag is rarely used,[152] even with the removal of the \"poison pill\" strategy (offering a contract with stipulations that the former club would be unable to match) that essentially ended the usage of the tag league-wide.[153] Each club is subject to a salary cap, which is set at US$188.2 million for the 2019 season,[154] US$11 million more than that of 2018.[154] Members of clubs' practice squads, despite being paid by and working for their respective clubs, are also simultaneously a kind of free agent and are able to sign to any other club's active roster (provided their new club is not their previous club's next opponent within a set number of days) without compensation to their previous club; practice squad players cannot be signed to other clubs' practice squads, however, unless released by their original club first.[155]",

                "content": "Patrick Mahomes escapes the pocket and runs for a 15-yard touchdown to give the Chiefs a 7-0 lead. KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- — Patrick Mahomes knew he could run on the ankle he sprained last week. The bigger concern for the Chiefs quarterback was how he would stop, when all the weight and pressure and momentum would land squarely upon it. The solution against Houston was simple: Mahomes didn't stop. The two-time MVP kept chugging forward until he plowed into the end zone on a 15-yard scramble to cap the Chiefs' opening drive on Saturday. Mahomes proceeded to throw for 260 yards and another score, never once looking troubled by his ailing ankle, and led Kansas City to a 27-19 victory that put the Chiefs on the brink of the No. 1 seed in the AFC playoffs. The Chiefs (14-1) can clinch the postseason bye and home-field advantage if Buffalo loses to or ties New England on Sunday. If the Bills win, Kansas City can wrap it up by beating Pittsburgh on Christmas Day — its third game in an 11-day span. “I ask a lot from the guys around me. I feel like if I'm going to ask them to play through pain and nicks and bruises, I've got to do it as well,” Mahomes said. “That's something that I pride myself on is being out there with my guys.” Xavier Worthy had seven catches for 65 yards and a touchdown, Kareem Hunt ran for 55 yards and another score, and Marquise Brown had five catches for 45 yards for Kansas City in his first game this season after recovering from a shoulder injury. The result was what Chiefs coach Andy Reid called his team's most comprehensive performance of the season. As for Mahomes? “He spoils the dog out of us, he's so tough,” Reid said. “You get used to it. But most guys don't come back from that like he did.” C.J. Stroud threw for 244 yards and two touchdowns with two interceptions for Houston (9-6), and one of those TD throws came at a great expense. Tank Dell, who had six catches for 98 yards, sustained a devastating knee injury on the play and was taken to the University of Kansas Medical Center, where Texans coach DeMeco Ryans said he would remain overnight. “All our thoughts and prayers are with Tank right now. You see what he means to our entire team,” Ryans said. “It hurts to see him go down like that. He was having a fantastic game, playing really well for us.” Stroud was visibly shaken by the injury and had to be consoled by teammates on the sideline. “I mean, all you can really do is pray,” he said. There were questions early in the week about whether Mahomes, who has a history of ankle injuries, would play at all after he sustained a high ankle sprain late in last week's win over Cleveland. But he was off the injury report by Friday, and he was on the field and leading the Chiefs to a touchdown on their opening possession. His scramble for a score was merely the start of a back-and-forth first half. The Texans answered with a 33-yard field goal, then went on a 13-play, 82-yard drive that ended with Stroud's touchdown toss to Dalton Schutlz. But the Chiefs quickly regained the lead when Hunt barreled into the end zone, and they tacked on a field goal a few minutes later after Stroud's second interception to lead 17-10 at the break. Dell was hurt on the Texans' opening drive of the third quarter. He was coming across the back of the end zone and made a spectacular catch but collided with teammate Jared Wayne on his way to the ground. He immediately grabbed his left knee, and players from both teams surrounded him as he was loaded onto a cart and driven from the field. Ka'imi Fairbairn promptly missed the extra point, and any momentum Houston might've had disappeared. Kansas City marched the other way, relying heavily on Worthy, who touched the ball four times on the drive. The first-round pick finished it off with an 8-yard reception, giving him a season high for receiving yards and his eighth touchdown of the year. The teams matched fourth-quarter field goals, and the Texans took over trailing 27-19 with just over five minutes to go. But the Chiefs forced a three-and-out, getting a sack from Josh Williams on a cornerback blitz, and ran out the clock from there. “This was a great test versus a really good playoff team,” Ryans said. “This was a playoff atmosphere here today. I thought our guys battled the right way. We just have to finish.” Taylor time Pop star Taylor Swift was on hand for the Chiefs' regular-season finale.

                "title": "Chiefs down Texans in another one-score win: Results, highlights",
                "content": "The Kansas City Chiefs came into Week 16 with concerns about how quarterback Patrick Mahomes would look after suffering a \"mild\" high-ankle sprain in the team's Week 15 win over the Cleveland Browns. Mahomes quickly put those worries to bed in Kansas City's 27-19 victory over the Houston Texans. He showed he was healthy by scrambling for 27 yards and a touchdown on two carries on Kansas City's open drive and never looked back. Mahomes finished the day going 28-of-41 for 260 yards and a touchdown. He connected well with Marquise \"Hollywood\" Brown (five catches, 45 yards) in his team debut while also continuing to see his chemistry with rookie Xavier Worthy (seven catches, 65 yards, one touchdown) grow. As a result, the Chiefs now need to win just once more to clinch the AFC's No. 1 seed. They can also clinch the top seed if the Buffalo Bills lose any of their final three games. The Texans had a fighting chance in this one-score loss, and it appeared they had changed the momentum when C.J. Stroud hit Tank Dell for a 30-yard touchdown to cut the Chiefs' lead to 17-16 early in the third quarter. NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more. However, Dell suffered a gruesome-looking knee injury on the play. He had to be carted off the field in an air cast, which left many Texans players emotional. After the injury and delay, Ka'imi Fairbairn missed an extra point, which set the tone for the rest of the game. The Dell injury took the wind out Houston's sails offensively and the team simply couldn't overcome the loss of its No. 2 receiver across from Nico Collins. The Texans scored just three more points and dropped to 9-6, positioning the AFC South winner as the likely No. 4 seed in the AFC playoff picture. USA TODAY Sports provided live updates, highlights and more from the Chiefs-Texans Saturday matchup below. On the first play after the two-minute warning, Hunt runs up the middle for 13 yards. The Chiefs can kneel on it from here and earn their 14th win of the 2024 NFL season. The Chiefs got a key sack of C.J. Stroud on a third-and-11 after Kansas City's field goal drive. Joshua Williams came on a cornerback blitz and nobody picked him up, forcing the Texans to punt with just 3:41 left in regulation. Houston has just two timeouts and the two-minute warning left to stop the clock. With a couple of first downs, the Chiefs may be able to run the clock out on this game. The Chiefs re-extended their lead to eight points after Harrison Butker made a chip-shot, 27-yard field goal to cap off a 14-play, 6:33 drive. The Texans got a much-needed stop on third-and-5 when Patrick Mahomes launched a pass toward Kelce in the back of the end-zone. Worthy flashed in front of the tight end, along with a defender, and went for the ball, assuming it was intended for him. The rookie couldn't make the catch and denied Kelce a chance at grabbing it. In fairness to Worthy, the defender may have been able to knock the ball down anyway, as Mahomes' pass came in on a low trajectory. Either way, Kansas City leads 27-19 with 5:13 left in the fourth quarter. The Texans had a golden opportunity in the red zone, but constant pressure from the Chiefs defense and a delay of game penalty pushed Houston to attempt a Ka'imi Fairbairn field goal. That pushed the Texans to within a touchdown, 24-19. Xavier Worthy accounted for 46 yards of offense on Kansas City's scoring drive, and he capped it off with a touchdown grab from the arm of Patrick Mahomes. Mahomes is 21-of-31 passing for 190 yards and two touchdowns on the day as the Chiefs extend their lead to 24-16 with 2:42 left in the third quarter. The Texans wide receiver was eventually taken off the field in a medical cart after his injury. The Texans would confirm that Dell suffered an injury to his left knee. Play resumed at Arrowhead Stadium after Dell received several minutes of medical attention on the field. He was stretchered off in an air cast after getting hurt on the Texans' touchdown after suffering a serious-looking knee injury. The Texans were shaken up after the injury, with several players showing emotion in its wake. It isn't clear if that had an impact on Fairbairn, but the veteran kicker missed his first extra point attempt of the season following the delay. As a result, the Chiefs still lead 17-16. The NBC broadcast cut back to Arrowhead Stadium to show Dell still down and being tended to on the field, with a cart out of the locker room. The cameras then showed a clearly emotional Stroud, who was among the players gathered around Dell. The good news for the Texans: C.J. Stroud hit Dell on a perfectly thrown 30-yard touchdown pass. The bad news: Dell was hit by his teammate while making the catch and suffered an apparent leg injury during the play. Dell immediately reached for his leg after the play. The Texans medical staff immediately came out to tend to him on the field. The Texans defense got off to a good start in the second half. They limited the Chiefs to five plays on their first drive before forcing Mahomes into a third-and-long. The quarterback tried to get the ball to Xavier Worthy, but Lassiter broke up the pass after undercutting the route. Tank Dell had a nice return of Matt Araiza's punt and that gave the Texans great starting field position around midfield. The Chiefs' mascot is a wolf known as KC Wolf. He was introduced in 1989 and \"has been bringing energy and excitement, as well as laughs and smiles to audiences of all ages,\" according to the team's official website. Houston's offense has moved the ball well against Kansas City's defense, but the team has been guilty of plenty of negative plays. That includes two interceptions and a few negative-yardage runs and screen pass efforts. Below is a look at the Texans' notable first-half stats: Patrick Mahomes is spreading the ball around as usual in the Chiefs' Week 16 game against the Texans, but it's becoming clear that Hollywood Brown is going to be one of his favorite targets now that the veteran is back from an injured collarbone. Below is a look at the Chiefs' notable first-half stats: The back-and-forth first half between the Chiefs and Texans came to an end after a C.J. Stroud Hail Mary attempt was knocked down at the goal line. Kansas City has gotten a strong showing from Patrick Mahomes, who is showing no signs of the ankle injury he dealt with leading up to the Week 16 contest. He has completed 13-of-20 passes for 127 yards while adding a touchdown and 27 yards on the ground. Meanwhile, Stroud has been shakier, making some big passing plays, including a 10-yard touchdown to Dalton Schultz, but has also tossed two interceptions. The Chiefs are set to get the ball first after halftime. They scored 10 unanswered points to close the half. After missing a 29-yard field goal on his lone attempt last week, Butker makes his first attempt in Week 16 from 44 yards away. That gives the Chiefs the lead with 19 seconds left in the half. The Texans were facing a third-and-20 on the edge of field goal range when Stroud tried to force a pass amid pressure. The result? Stroud hit Trent McDuffie over the middle of the field, and that allowed Chiefs to get the ball back with just under a minute left in the half. The Chiefs are back on top after an easy score for Hunt. The veteran back entered the game on a first-and-goal and patiently waited for the Chiefs' interior offensive line to open a lane for him to the end-zone. It developed, he saw it and powered through the final yard to put the Chiefs up 14-10. Kansas City's go-ahead drive covered 82 yards and was 13 plays long. The Chiefs converted four third downs on the drive and will now look to protect a lead with 4:38 left until halftime. No, Brown's first name is still Marquise. He just prefers to go by his nickname \"Hollywood,\" which most broadcasts are now doing. Brown grew up in Hollywood, Fla., which is how he earned the nickname. It lends itself well to him given his origins and his flashy, speedy style of play when healthy. A strange play just unfolded in Saturday's Chiefs vs. Texans game. Houston pressured Patrick Mahomes and appeared to force the quarterback to fumble. The Texans picked up the ball and brought it all the way to the end zone for a touchdown. However, the play was later ruled an incomplete pass just before Derek Barnett was called for roughing the passer. As such, the Chiefs avoided a third-and-10 and took the ball across midfield while the Texans were denied a chance to go up by two scores. Mahomes had been sacked 35 times entering Week 16. That is easily the most he has ever been sacked in a single season, seven more than his previous career high of 28 in 2021. Stroud faced pressure from George Karlaftis on a first-and-goal from the 10-yard line but scrambled out to his right to create time to throw. Eventually, he found Schultz wide open in the middle of the field and lofted a pass to him for an easy completion. The Kansas City crowd jeered the officials for choosing not to flag what it believed was a holding call against the Texans on Karlaftis. Ka'imi Fairbairn converted on the extra point to give the Texans a 10-7 lead. Kansas City may be leading after 15 minutes, but Houston is driving and nearing scoring range. Nico Collins caught a 32-yard pass to close the quarter after winning quickly off the line of scrimmage and forcing the Chiefs defensive back to chase him down along the sidelines. C.J. Stroud is 7-of-11 for 74 yards in the early goings of the game, though he did throw an interception on a first-drive overthrow. His counterpart, Patrick Mahomes, has gone an efficient 6-of-7 for 38 yards but also has run for 27 yards and a touchdown, showing that his injured ankle isn't much of a concern at all. The Texans were able to pressure and sack Mahomes on their second defensive drive, something they couldn't do their first time playing defense. They will need to continuing doing that to keep Kansas City's offense out of rhythm. Mahomes has been sacked more during the 2024 NFL season than he has at any point during his career. He took another one on the team's second drive when Harris came on a blitz and dropped the Chiefs quarterback. Mahomes got up just fine after the hit, which was notable given his injury. The loss pushed the team back into a third-and-long, however, and Kansas City was forced to punt the ball back to the Texans after failing to convert that. The Chiefs lost to the Buffalo Bills 30-21 in a Week 11 during which Josh Allen racked up 317 yards and two touchdowns. That marks Kansas City's only defeat of the 2024 NFL season through 15 weeks. C.J. Stroud and the Houston offense mounted a good response to Kansas City's touchdown drive, as Nico Collins, Tank Dell and Joe Mixon ripped off some big plays to get the Texans into the red zone. Ultimately, they stalled out and Ka'imi Fairbairn came on to attempt a 33-yard field goal. Fairbairn made the chip-shot to get the Texans on the board and make it 7-3 Chiefs. How healthy is Mahomes' injured ankle? The Chiefs quarterback isn't as fast as he has usually is, but he also showed that fans shouldn't be overly concerned about his mobility being impacted by his \"mild\" high-ankle sprain. Mahomes ran for 12 yards on a third-and-13 earlier in the drive before taking off from the 15-yard line later to score a touchdown on a run up the middle. Mahomes now has 27 rushing yards in the first quarter of the game. That's already the fourth-most he has recorded in a single game this season. The Texans faced a third-and-12 on their first drive and Stroud tried to force a downfield shot to Collins in double coverage. Rookie Jaden Hicks caught the overthrown pass and set Kansas City up with great field position on its first drive of the day. Houston's first drive is off to an inauspicious start, as starting right guard Mason was hurt just four plays into it. He walked off the field under his own power but headed for the blue medical tent. The Texans were already without starting left guard Juice Scruggs and will be forced to put either Kenyon Green or Kendrick Green into action. The Chiefs and Texans are scheduled for kick off on Saturday at 1 p.m. ET, noon CT. NBC will broadcast the Chiefs-Texans matchup in Week 16. Noah Eagle will be on play-by-play, and he will be flanked by Todd Blackledge (color commentary). It appears that Swift is in attendance for the Chiefs' Saturday matchup with the Texans. She was spotted getting onto a golf cart at Arrowhead Stadium and is presumably be transported to her suite to watch her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, in action. The Chiefs wide receiver, who has not played at all in 2024, will make his season debut on Saturday. Brown suffered a shoulder injury during preseason and will be a major boost to the Chiefs wide receiver corps. Noah Eagle (play-by-play) and Todd Blackledge (color commentary) will be the announcers for the Chiefs vs. Texans games. The duo usual broadcasts NBC's package of prime-time college games, but they were called up to the NFL level to allow Mike Tirico and Cris Collinsworth to call just one game over the weekend. Kathryn Tappen will join Eagles and Blackledge as a sideline reporter. Yes, Noah Eagle is Ian Eagle's son. The 28-year-old attended Syracuse and broke into sports media in 2019 before rapidly rising the ranks to become a major network play-by-play man. Carson Wentz is the Chiefs' backup quarterback for the 2024 NFL season. The former Philadelphia Eagles star signed a one-year deal with the Chiefs during the offseason to take on that role after playing behind Matthew Stafford with the Los Angeles Rams in the second half of the 2023 NFL season. On Thursday, head coach Andy Reid told reporters he expected his quarterback to make the start. That turned out to be true, as Mahomes will to start vs. the Houston. Patrick Mahomes and Marquise \"Hollywood\" Brown will both play vs. the Texans today. Mahomes avoids missing a game due to injury, while Brown is making his season debut. The Texans will be without starting guard Juice Scruggs and a handful of veteran role players for Sunday's game against the Chiefs.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Kansas City Chiefs maintained their hold on the AFC's top seed by securing yet another one-score victory, extending their NFL record to 16 games by defeating the visiting Houston Texans by a score of 27-19. The Chiefs got things started early by picking off C.J. Stroud on Houston's opening drive. Just in case anyone thought Patrick Mahomes would be limited by the high ankle sprain he suffered last week, he quickly quieted those concerns with a pair of scrambles on the Chiefs' first possession, with the second of those runs starting the scoring as he scored a touchdown from 15 yards out. The Texans would eventually answer back and actually take a 10-7 lead after Stroud found Dalton Schultz for a touchdown early in the second quarter, but Kansas City immediately answered with a Kareem Hunt touchdown run, another interception on Stroud and then a late-half field goal to take a seven-point lead into halftime. The Texans forced a punt on the opening drive of the second half and actually looked like they were about to tie the game when Stroud lofted a beautiful pass to Tank Dell in the back of the end zone, but Dell suffered a gruesome injury on the play and, after a long delay, Ka'imi Fairbairn missed the extra point. That one-point deficit was the closest Houston would get the rest of the afternoon. Even after Kansas City turned it over on downs near midfield, the Texans were unable to take advantage; and the Chiefs drove down the field for an Xavier Worthy touchdown on their next drive. After the two teams traded field goals, the Texans had a chance to drive for a game-tying score late in the fourth quarter, but went nowhere after Stroud got dropped for a sack on third-and-long. All Kansas City had to do after that was run out the clock, which it did with a series of runs and short passes. Standard Chiefs stuff in another standard Chiefs win in what is looking a lot like a standard Chiefs season in the Mahomes-Andy Reid era. Strong game-planning, Mahomes magic and timely turnovers. Kansas City's offensive line has struggled all season, and Andy Reid devised a game plan to account for that. Mahomes repeatedly fired quick passes to Xavier Worthy and DeAndre Hopkins, and Travis Kelce repeatedly sat himself down in underneath zones. Mahomes was under pressure often, but only sacked once. The defense, meanwhile, came up with a pair of interceptions to bookend the first half, setting up the offense to score 10 free points. Major miscues in big moments, and a defense that just couldn't get the big stop. Houston ended its first drive of the game and its last drive of the first half with interceptions. Ka'imi Fairbairn missed an extra point. C.J. Stroud took not one but two delay-of-game penalties in the second half. Dalton Schultz dropped what should have been a third-down conversion late in the third quarter. Offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik kept calling wide receiver screens that went nowhere. Meanwhile, the Chiefs converted 7 of 13 third downs and 3 of their 4 red zone opportunities into touchdowns, while Houston went just 1 of 3 in the red zone. Late in the second quarter, the Texans had a chance to take the lead -- or at least cut into Kansas City's advantage. They quickly got into Chiefs territory before things started going awry. Tank Dell was called for offensive pass interference on a swing pass on first down, setting the Texans back behind the chains. Two incomplete passes later and it was third-and-20 from Kansas City's 40-yard line. The Texans were in Ka'imi Fairbairn's range, so when C.J. Stroud saw quick pressure, he tried to throw the ball away to preserve a shot at a field goal. But his throwaway didn't actually go away. Instead, it landed in the waiting arms of Trent McDuffie. Instead of having a chance to take a lead for themselves, the Texans were left defending against the Chiefs extending theirs. They buckled down once Kansas City got just outside the red zone, but the Chiefs took a 17-10 lead into halftime and never trailed again. The best play of the day was Tank Dell's 30-yard touchdown grab in the third quarter, but Dell unfortunately suffered a gruesome knee injury on the play. (If you really want to watch it, you can do so right here.) So instead, we'll go with the game's first touchdown, where we saw pretty early on that Patrick Mahomes' ankle was just fine. Mere days after suffering a high ankle sprain, Mahomes had two big scrambles on Kansas City's opening drive, including the one above. He ended the afternoon with three carries for 35 yards and the score, helping move the chains for the Chiefs several times. Kansas City is 14-1 and remains the No. 1 seed in the AFC. The Chiefs have long since clinched the AFC West and have the inside track for home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs. Next up for K.C. is a Christmas Day game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, followed by a trip to Denver to take on the Broncos in Week 18. The Texans are now 9-6 and looking like they will be the No. 4 seed in the AFC. They're already AFC South champions, but they've likely fallen too far behind the AFC North winner to move up to No. 3 in the conference. They close out their season by hosting the Baltimore Ravens on Christmas, then traveling to Tennessee to take on the Titans in Week 18. That'll do it, folks. The Chiefs can now kneel on the ball and run out the clock. ANOTHER one-score win for the Chiefs, who will move to 14-1. A first-down run for negative yards set the Texans back on their game-tying drive attempt. (What else is new?) And then Stroud fired a ball out of bounds under heavy pressure, then took a third-down sack with Joshua Williams coming unblocked blitzing off the edge. K.C. has a chance to potentially run the clock out here. No Chris Jones out there for the Chiefs defense on this drive. He's questionable to return with a calf injury. Mahomes tried to fire the ball back across his body to Kelce in the back of the end zone, but Worthy didn't see Kelce behind him and tried to catch it himself. The ball bounced off his hands and fell incomplete, so Harrison Butker knocked a field goal through the uprights to make it an 8-point game once again. Houston has just over 5 minutes to drive for a potential game-tying score. Houston again drove into Kansas City territory, but again had issues with negative plays. A first-down run was tackled behind the line of scrimmage. A C.J. Stroud scramble turned into a sack. And Stroud took his second delay-of-game penalty of the half. The Texans ended up settling for a field goal to make it a 5-point game. Yet another one-possession game for both the Chiefs and Texans, who have each been great in close contests this year. Fourth quarter coming up. This is Worthy's best game of the year, in terms of his overall level of involvement in the offense. He just picked up his seventh catch of the game, and this one goes for a touchdown. (He also has three carries.) Chiefs up by 8 after the extra point. Perfect ball from Stroud to Schultz on third down but Schultz just straight dropped it. Worth nothing, Stroud and Dell connected on the exact same throw in the exact same situation earlier in the game. Kansas City had excellent field position after a great kick return following the Dell touchdown, but Isaiah Pacheco's three carries totaled -1 yard and he was stuffed for no gain on fourth-and-1. Texans take over in Chiefs territory now with a chance to re-take the lead. Dell's fractured leg came on Dec. 3 of last year. He also suffered a gunshot wound this offseason after a stray bullet went through his leg when he was an innocent bystander. And now this knee injury. So horrible for such a talented, electrifying player. You can see how bad it is by looking at Stroud and Collins, who are absolutely distraught. What an awful, awful scene. The cart is out for Dell and he's being taken to the locker room. Ugh. Oh no. Tank Dell just made a fantastic touchdown catch in the back of the end zone, for arguably his best catch of the year. More than likely ties the game for Houston after the extra point. But in the process, he took a hit to the outside of his knee, which bent in the wrong direction. He knew immediately after he went down that it was a problem. Remember, he fractured his leg at the end of last season as well. Y-I-K-E-S. The Texans just burned a timeout on their second play of the half, after an incomplete pass. That is really, really bad -- especially when you're in a one-score game against the Chiefs, on the road. Kamari Lassiter ALMOST picked off Patrick Mahomes. Great play to dive and get his hands on the ball on the crossing route intended for Worthy, who had a step of separation. Both Worthy and Dell are on the sideline with their teams to start the second half and look like they're ready to go. The Chiefs took advantage of Stroud's second turnover of the game by scoring for a second time. 10 points off turnovers for the Chiefs. And they get the ball to start the second half with a chance to make this a two-score game. Not ideal for the Chiefs. Worthy has been extremely involved so far today, with 4 catches and 2 rushing attempts. It looked like he fell while running his route before limping to the sideline. KC's wide receiver corps has been banged up all season. Update: Worthy is QUESTIONABLE to return with an ankle injury. Whoo boy. Really bad decision and throw from Stroud on this third-and-20. He was under heavy pressure and tried to jump and just get rid of the ball to avoid a sack, but instead threw it right into Trent McDuffie's arms. Big time missed opportunity for Houston. And now Dell just got called for a seemingly phantom offensive pass interference, then went to the bench to get checked out with some sort of injury. He threw his helmet towards a trainer, which doesn't seem great. Update: Dell is back after missing one snap. Tank Dell already has 5 catches. He only had four entire games with 5 catches coming into today. And his 68 yards are already his third-most of the season. After a 13-play, 82-yard drive, Kansas City has the lead back. The Chiefs converted four third-down opportunities on the drive, which Kareem Hunt polished off with a 3-yard touchdown run. KC gets the ball coming out in the third quarter, so the Texans will want to put some points on the board here to prevent a double-up opportunity. VERY bad injury news for the Texans. Ward has been a key player in the secondary all season, moving between safety and the slot. He got his ankle rolled up while trying to shake a block from Travis Kelce. Wow, a HUGE swing right there. Not only does a review overturn the Mahomes fumble that resulted in a scoop-and-score; because the play was ruled a pass, Tim Settle got called for roughing the passer and gave Kansas City a free 15 yards. Hollywood Brown has now played five snaps (all passing plays) and has two catches for 32 yards. Really nice job by C.J. Stroud to buy some time in the pocket here by rolling out to his right and drafting just a little bit backward. Dalton Schultz kind of tossed Trent McDuffie aside and freed himself up in the middle of the end zone for the touchdown. Nice bounceback by the Texans after the early interception and subsequent touchdown drive. They're now up 10-7. (Schultz probably could've been called for OPI, and there was probably a hold that prevented George Karlaftis from getting to Stroud, too.) Stroud is bailing the Texans out of some tough third downs. Three conversions already on this drive. Things looked really discombobulated for a minute on third-and-medium for the Texans, but Stroud and Collins bailed them out. Stroud was under heavy pressure and just floated the ball into open space before Collins even made his break, and Collins made a great adjustment to get to the ball and then create some yards after the catch. Really well-designed blitz from DeMeco Ryans to get a Christian Harris sack on second down. He came totally unblocked through the middle of the line. That sent KC's drive back and Mahomes just checked it down to Travis Kelce for a short gain on third down. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "content": "As coach MLB records Rickey Nelson Henley Henderson (December 25, 1958 – December 20, 2024), nicknamed \"Man of Steal\", was an American professional baseball left fielder who played 25 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for nine teams from 1979 to 2003, including four separate tenures with his original team, the Oakland Athletics. He is widely regarded as baseball's greatest leadoff hitter and baserunner.[1][2] He holds MLB records for career stolen bases, runs, unintentional walks, and leadoff home runs. At the time of his last major league game in 2003, the ten-time American League (AL) All-Star ranked among the sport's top 100 all-time home run hitters and was its all-time leader in walks. In 2009, he was inducted to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. Henderson holds the single-season record for stolen bases (130 in 1982) and is the only player in AL history to steal 100 bases in a season, having done so three times (in 1980, 1982, and 1983). His 1,406 career steals is 50% higher than the previous record of 938 by Lou Brock. Henderson is the all-time stolen base leader for the Oakland Athletics[3] and previously held the New York Yankees' franchise record from 1988 to 2011.[4][5] He was among the league's top ten base stealers in 21 different seasons. Henderson was named the AL's Most Valuable Player in 1990, and he was twice the lead-off hitter for World Series champions: the 1989 Oakland Athletics and the 1993 Toronto Blue Jays. A 12-time stolen base champion, Henderson led the league in runs five times. His 25-season career elevated him to the top ten in several other categories, including career at-bats, games, and outfield putouts and total chances. His high on-base percentage, power hitting, and stolen base and run totals made him one of the most dominant and innovative players of all time. He was further known for his unquenchable passion for playing baseball and a buoyant, eccentric, and quotable personality that both perplexed and entertained fans. Once asked if he thought Henderson was a future Hall of Famer, statistician Bill James replied, \"If you could split him in two, you'd have two Hall of Famers.\"[6] Henderson was born on December 25, 1958, in Chicago in the back seat of an Oldsmobile on the way to the hospital. Henderson later joked, \"I was already fast. I couldn't wait.\"[7] He was named Rickey Nelson Henley, after singer-actor Ricky Nelson,[8] and is the son of John L. Henley and Bobbie Henley.[8] When he was two years old, his father moved to Oakland, California. Rickey lived with his grandmother in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, from when he was two until he was seven, when he migrated to Oakland with his family. His father died in an automobile accident 10 years after leaving home.[9] His mother married Paul Henderson in Rickey Henley's junior year of high school and the family adopted the Henderson surname.[8] As a child learning to play baseball in Oakland, Rickey Henderson developed the ability to bat right-handed although he was a naturally left-handed thrower—a rare combination for baseball players, especially non-pitchers.[10] In the entire history of Major League Baseball through the 2008 season, only 57 position players are known to have batted right and thrown left, and Henderson is easily the most successful player to do so.[11] Henderson later said, \"All my friends were right-handed and swung from the right side, so I thought that's the way it was supposed to be done.\"[12] In 1976, Henderson graduated from Oakland Technical High School in Oakland, California, where he played baseball, basketball and football, and was an All-American running back with two 1,000-yard rushing seasons. He also ran track, but did not stay with the team as the schedule conflicted with baseball.[13] Henderson received over a dozen scholarship offers to play football. Despite a childhood dream to play for the Oakland Raiders, he turned down the scholarships on the advice of his mother, who argued that football players had shorter careers.[13][14] Henderson was drafted by the Oakland Athletics in the fourth round of the 1976 Major League Baseball draft.[15] For the first season of his minor league career he was with the Boise A's of the Northwest League. In 46 games, Henderson batted .336 and hit three home runs and two triples.[16] Henderson spent the following season with the Modesto A's. He batted .345 in 134 games during his record-setting season with Modesto. Henderson, along with Darrell Woodard, nearly broke the league record for team stolen bases. The Modesto A's finished the season with 357 stolen bases,[17] just shy of the league record of 370.[18] While Woodard tied the single-season player record with 90 stolen bases,[17] Henderson beat the record by stealing 95 bases, and was awarded the Sundial Trophy, given to the Modesto A's Most Valuable Player.[16][19] Henderson spent the 1978 season with the Jersey City A's of the Eastern League. After the minor league season ended, he played the 1978–1979 winter season for the Navojoa Mayos of the Mexican Pacific League. He played in six games for the team, which won its first championship.[20] In 1979, Henderson started the season with the Ogden A's of the Pacific Coast League. In 71 games for Ogden, he had a batting average of .309 and stole 44 bases.[16] Henderson made his major league debut with Oakland on June 24, 1979, getting two hits in four at-bats, along with a stolen base.[21] He batted .274 with 33 stolen bases in 89 games.[22] In 1980, Henderson became the third modern-era player to steal 100 bases in a season (Maury Wills 104 in 1962 and Lou Brock's 118 in 1974 had preceded him).[23] His 100 steals broke Eddie Collins' franchise record of 81 in 1910 with what were then the Philadelphia Athletics and set a new American League (AL) record, surpassing Ty Cobb's 96 set in 1915.[23] He also batted .303, had 179 hits (tied for ninth in AL), scored 111 runs (fourth in AL), drew 117 walks (second in AL), had a .420 on-base percentage (third in AL) and led the AL by reaching base 301 times.[24] That winter, Henderson played in the Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League; his 42 stolen bases broke that league's record as well.[25] Henderson was an MVP candidate a year later, in a season shortened by a players' strike. He hit .319, fourth in the AL, and led the league in hits (135), runs (89) and in steals (56). Henderson was also third in on-base percentage (.408), tied for second in triples (7), fourth in walks (64), eighth in total bases (185) and second in times reaching base (201). In so doing, he became the emblematic figure of Oakland manager Billy Martin's aggressive \"Billy Ball\" philosophy, which received much media attention.[26] Finishing second to the Milwaukee Brewers' Rollie Fingers in the MVP voting, Henderson's fielding that season also earned him his only Gold Glove Award. He later became known for his showboat \"snatch catches\", in which he would flick his glove out at incoming fly balls, then whip his arm behind his back after making the catch.[27] In 1982, Henderson broke Lou Brock's modern major league single season record by stealing 130 bases, a total which has not been approached since. He stole 84 bases by the All-Star break; no player has stolen as many as 84 bases in an entire season since 1988, when Henderson himself stole 93.[28] Henderson's 130 steals outpaced nine of the American League's 14 teams that season. He also led the AL in walks (116), was fourth in runs (119) and third in on-base percentage (.398).[24] Inspired by Dodgers leadoff hitter Rudy Law, Henderson adopted an exaggerated crouch as his batting stance, which reduced his strike zone without sacrificing much power.[29] Sportswriter Jim Murray described Henderson's strike zone as being \"smaller than Hitler's heart\".[30] In 1982, he described his approach to Sports Illustrated: I found that if I squatted down real low at the plate... I could see the ball better. I also knew it threw the pitcher off. I found that I could put my weight on my back foot and still turn my hips on the swing. I'm down so low I don't have much of a strike zone. Sometimes, walking so much even gets me mad. Last year Ed Ott of the Angels got so frustrated because the umpire was calling balls that would've been strikes on anybody else that he stood up and shouted at me, \"Stand up and hit like a man.\" I guess I do that to people.[31] Regarding Henderson's 1982 season, the mid-1980s book The Hidden Game of Baseball looked at such statistics as .78 expected runs with a runner on first and no outs, 1.07 expected runs with runner on second and no outs, and only .25 expected runs no one on and one out. The authors concluded that with Henderson's 130 stolen bases he contributed 22.2 runs to the A's offense. By being caught stealing 42 times, he cost his team 20.6 runs, and therefore, the authors concluded, the net effect of his running activity was merely 1.6 extra runs for the season.[32] A later analysis determined his net contribution was 5.3 runs for the season.[33] Henderson also made MLB history in 1983 with his third 100 runs/100 stolen bases/100 walks season (no modern player has done it once), when he led the AL in stolen bases (108), walks (103) while finishing fourth in runs scored (105). He was also second in on-base percentage (.414), tied for ninth in triples (7) and fifth in times on base, reaching 257 times.[24] In 1984, Henderson hit 16 home runs while leading the league in stolen bases (66), finishing second in runs scored (113) and third in on-base-percentage (.399). After the season, he was traded to the New York Yankees.[24] As his muscular frame developed, Henderson continued to improve as a hitter. His increasing power-hitting ability eventually led to a record for home runs to lead off a game. During his career, he hit over 20 home runs in four different seasons, with a high of 28 in 1986 and again in 1990.[24] In December 1984, Henderson was traded to the New York Yankees along with Bert Bradley for five players: Tim Birtsas, Jay Howell, Stan Javier, Eric Plunk, and José Rijo.[24] In his first season with the Yankees, he led the league in runs scored (146) and stolen bases (80), was fourth in batting average (.314), walks (99) and on-base percentage (.419), seventh in slugging (.516), third in OPS (.934) and hit 24 home runs.[34] He also won the Silver Slugger Award, and was third in the voting for the MVP award. His 146 runs scored were the most since Ted Williams had 150 in 1950,[35] and he became the first player since Jimmie Foxx in 1939 to amass more runs scored than games played. Henderson became the first player in major league history to reach 80 stolen bases and 20 home runs in the 1985 season. He matched the feat in 1986, as did the Reds' Eric Davis; they remain the only players in major league history who are in the \"20/80 club\".[24][36] It was with the Yankees that Henderson, who had previously worn number 35 with Oakland, which was already taken by his Yankees teammate Phil Niekro, switched to his now famous 24, a number he would wear for the rest of his career (with two exceptions: (1) he briefly wore number 14 in 1993 while playing with the Blue Jays, (2) he wore his \"old\" number 35 in 2000 and 2002 while playing with the Mariners and the Red Sox, and (3) he wore number 25 while playing with the Dodgers).[37] In 1986, he led the AL in runs scored (130) and stolen bases (87) for the second year in a row, and was seventh in walks (89) and extra base hits (64) while hitting 28 home runs (9 of which led off games) and had 74 RBIs.[38] In 1987, he had a below-average season by his standards, fueling criticism from the New York media, which had never covered Henderson or his eccentricities kindly.[39] Yankees owner George Steinbrenner issued a press release claiming that manager Lou Piniella wanted to trade Henderson for \"jaking it\" (playing lackadaisically).[40] Still, Henderson had his best on-base percentage to that point in his career (.423), with a .291 batting avg., was fifth in the AL in stolen bases (41) and hit 17 home runs despite playing only 95 games.[41] It was the only season from 1980 to 1991 in which Henderson did not lead the AL in steals. Seattle's Harold Reynolds led the league with 60 steals; Reynolds tells the story of getting an impish phone call from Henderson after the season: The phone rings. 'Henderson here.' I say, 'Hey, what's going on, Rickey?' I think he's calling to congratulate me, but he goes, 'Sixty stolen bases? You ought to be ashamed. Rickey would have 60 at the break'... then click, he hung up.\"[7] In 1988, Henderson led the AL in steals (93), was third in runs scored (118), fifth in OBP (.394) and seventh in walks (82), while hitting .305.[24] Though only in New York for 4+1⁄2 seasons, Henderson set the Yankees' franchise record with 326 stolen bases; the previous high (248) had been held by Hal Chase, who last played for the Yankees in 1913, when the team was still known as the Highlanders. On May 28, 2011, Henderson's total was surpassed by Derek Jeter,[42] who by that point had already played 1,700 more games as a Yankee than Henderson.[43] On June 21, 1989, the Yankees traded Henderson back to Oakland for Plunk, Greg Cadaret, and Luis Polonia.[44] After the trade, his 52 steals and 72 runs scored led the Athletics into the postseason;[24] his 126 walks for the year were the most for any AL hitter since 1970. With a record eight steals in five games, he was named MVP of the American League Championship Series; he hit .400 while scoring eight runs and delivering two home runs, five runs batted in (RBIs), seven walks and a 1.000 slugging percentage. Leading the Athletics to a four-game sweep over the San Francisco Giants and the franchise's first World Series title since 1974, Henderson hit .474 with an .895 slugging average (including two triples and a homer), while stealing three more bases.[24] On August 22, 1989, he became Nolan Ryan's 5,000th strikeout victim, but Henderson took an odd delight in the occurrence, saying, \"If you haven't been struck out by Nolan Ryan, you're nobody.\"[45] A year later, Henderson finished second in the league in batting average with a mark of .325, losing out to the Kansas City Royals' George Brett on the final day of the season. Henderson had a remarkably consistent season, with his batting average falling below .320 for only one game, the third of the year. Reaching safely by a hit or a walk in 125 of his 136 games, he led the league in runs (119), stolen bases (65), on-base percentage (.439) and OPS (1.016) was second in slugging percentage (.577), fourth in walks (97) and extra base hits (66), sixth in home runs (28) and total bases (282) and had 61 RBIs. Henderson won the AL's MVP award and helped Oakland to another pennant. He again performed well in the World Series (.333 batting, .667 slugging, a home run and three steals in four games), but the A's were swept by the underdog Cincinnati Reds.[46] On May 1, 1991, Henderson broke one of baseball's most noted records when he stole the 939th base of his career, one more than Lou Brock's total compiled from 1961 to 1979, mainly with the St. Louis Cardinals.[47][48] On July 16, 1993, Henderson broke the world stolen base record by stealing his 1,066th base, thus going past the record which was previously held by Yutaka Fukumoto. In 90 games with Oakland, he was batting .327 (second in AL) with 17 home runs and 47 RBIs. He also had scored 77 runs, stolen 31 bases, drew 85 walks, had a .469 on-base percentage and was slugging .553.[24] In July 1993, the Athletics traded Henderson to the playoff-bound Toronto Blue Jays for Steve Karsay and José Herrera.[24] He performed disappointingly for the Jays, hitting only .215 in 44 games, which was probably due to the fact that he fractured a bone on his hand early on with the team, after being hit by a pitch, although he still contributed 22 stolen bases and 37 runs scored. However, his hitting woes continued in the post-season, batting .120 in the American League Championship Series and .227 in the World Series. Nevertheless, Henderson was involved in the final play of the World Series that year. He and Paul Molitor scored on Joe Carter's Series-ending home run, one of the most famous moments in baseball history.[49] After the 1993 season, Henderson re-signed as a free agent with Oakland in December 1993.[24] In 1994 and 1995, Henderson finished in the top 10 in the league in walks, steals and on-base percentage.[24] His .300 average in 1995 marked his sixth and final season in the AL with a .300 or better average.[24] Henderson signed with the San Diego Padres in the offseason. In 1996, he again finished in the top ten in the National League (NL) in walks, OBP, steals and runs.[50] On August 13, 1997, the Padres traded Henderson to the Anaheim Angels for minor leaguers Ryan Hancock and Stevenson Agosto, as well as a player to be named later.[51] The Padres acquired George Arias to complete the trade.[52] As an Angel, Henderson batted only .183 for the rest of the season.[24] In January 1998, Henderson signed as a free agent with the Athletics, the fourth time he played for the franchise.[24] That season he led the majors in stolen bases (66) and the AL in walks (118), while scoring 101 runs.[24] In so doing, the 39-year-old became the oldest player to lead a league in stolen bases, and the oldest player to reach 50 steals.[53] A year later, Henderson signed as a free agent with the New York Mets. In 1999, he batted .315 with 37 steals and was seventh in the NL in on-base percentage.[54] Henderson was voted the 1999 National League comeback player of the year by The Sporting News. He wore number 24, which—although not officially retired—had not been regularly worn by a Mets player since Willie Mays' retirement in 1973. Nonetheless, Henderson and the Mets were an uneasy fit. After the Mets' loss in the 1999 NLCS, the New York press made much of a card game between Henderson and Bobby Bonilla. Both players had been substituted out of the lineup, and they reportedly left the dugout before the playoff game had concluded.[55] Henderson sought a raise on his $1.9 million salary for the 2000 season, but the Mets refused to renegotiate. He also feuded with manager Bobby Valentine and complained about traveling to Tokyo for the 2000 season opening series against the Chicago Cubs. Henderson batted .219 with no home runs and two RBIs before the Mets put him on waivers and granted him his release in May.[56][57] After his release from the Mets, Henderson signed as a free agent with the Seattle Mariners.[58] In his second game as a Mariner, on May 20, Henderson hit a leadoff home run, thus becoming the third player to hit a home run in four different decades (Ted Williams and Willie McCovey were the others).[59] Despite starting the season in the National League, Henderson finished fourth in the AL in stolen bases (31).[60] A free agent in March 2001, Henderson returned to the Padres. During the 2001 season, he broke three major league career records and reached an additional major career milestone. He broke Babe Ruth's record of 2,062 career walks,[50] Ty Cobb's record of 2,245 career runs,[61] and Zack Wheat's record of 2,328 career games in left field, and on the final day of the season (October 7) collected his 3,000th career hit, a leadoff double off Rockies pitcher John Thomson in San Diego.[62][63] That final game was also Tony Gwynn's last major league game, and Henderson had originally wanted to sit out so as not to detract from the occasion, but Gwynn insisted that Henderson play.[64] After scoring the game's first run, Henderson was removed from the lineup. At the age of 42, in his last substantial major league season, Henderson finished the year with 25 stolen bases, ninth in the NL;[24] it also marked his 23rd consecutive season with more than 20 steals.[24] Of the ten top base stealers who were still active as of 2002, the other nine each stole fewer bases in 2002 than the 42-year-old Henderson.[65] In February 2002, Henderson signed as a free agent with the Boston Red Sox, where at age 43 he became the oldest player to play center field in major league history when he replaced Johnny Damon for three games in April and another in July. Henderson's arrival was marked by a statistical oddity. During the 22+1⁄2 years from his June 1979 debut through the end of the 2001 season, he had stolen more bases by himself than his new team had: 1,395 steals for Henderson, 1,382 for the Boston franchise. The Red Sox finally \"passed\" Henderson on April 30, 2002. At age 43, Henderson was the oldest player in the American League.[66] While playing in Boston, Henderson wore his old number 35, as his regular number 24 was already taken by Red Sox teammate Manny Ramirez.[67][68] As the 2003 season began, Henderson was without a team for the first time in his career. He played in the independent Atlantic League with the Newark Bears, hoping for a chance with another major league organization.[69][70] After being named the Atlantic League All-Star Game MVP and receiving much media attention, the Los Angeles Dodgers signed him over the All-Star break. In 30 games with the Dodgers, he had 15 hits and three stolen bases, with a .208 batting average.[24] Before the 2003 season, his last in the majors, Henderson discussed his reputation for hanging onto his lengthy baseball career: Each and every day I set a record, but we never talk about it. We'll talk about a home run hitter 24/7. Well, they haven't broken any all-time records, but they hit homers, and that's what matters nowadays. You continue playing, you accomplish a lot, and you'd think people would look at it as a fantastic career. Instead, Rickey thinks people want Rickey to quit more than anything.\"[71] Henderson played his last major league game on September 19, 2003; he was hit by a pitch in his only plate appearance, and came around to score his 2,295th run. Though it became increasingly unlikely that he would return, he continued to publicly debate his own official retirement.[72] After leaving the Dodgers, Henderson started his second consecutive season with the Newark Bears in May 2004.[73] In 91 games he had a .462 OBP, with more than twice as many walks (96) as strikeouts (41), and stole 37 bases while being caught only twice.[16] On May 9, 2005, Henderson signed with the San Diego Surf Dawgs of the Golden Baseball League, an independent league. This was the Surf Dawgs' and the Golden Baseball League's inaugural season, and Henderson helped the team to the league championship. In 73 games he had a .456 OBP, with 73 walks while striking out 43 times, and 16 steals while being caught only twice.[74] It would be his final professional season. Henderson would not accept the end of his major league career. In May 2005, he was still insisting that he was capable of playing in the major leagues. NBC and ESPN reported that Henderson had announced his much-delayed official retirement on December 6, 2005, but his agent denied the report the following day. On February 10, 2006, he accepted a position as a hitting instructor for the Mets, while leaving the door open to returning as a player. In July 2006, Henderson discussed an offer he'd received to rejoin the Surf Dawgs for the 2006 season, which would have been his 31st in professional baseball, but suggested he'd had enough. Six weeks later, though, on August 11, he claimed \"It's sort of weird not to be playing, but I decided to take a year off\", adding, \"I can't say I will retire. My heart is still in it... I still love the game right now, so I'm going to wait it out and see what happens.\"[75] On May 18, 2007, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that Oakland general manager Billy Beane was considering adding Henderson to the roster for one game in September, provided it did not \"infringe on the integrity of the roster or of the season\", so that Henderson could retire as an Oakland A's player.[76] A month later, Henderson appeared to reject the overture, saying, \"One day? I don't want one day. I want to play again, man. I don't want nobody's spot... I just want to see if I deserve to be out there. If I don't, just get rid of me, release me. And if I belong, you don't have to pay me but the minimum—and I'll donate every penny of that to some charity. So, how's that hurtin' anybody?... Don't say goodbye for me... When I want that one day they want to give me so bad, I'll let you know.\"[77] The Athletics retired Henderson's #24 on August 1, 2009.[78] Henderson finally conceded his \"official retirement\" on July 13, 2007: \"I haven't submitted retirement papers to MLB, but I think MLB already had their papers that I was retired.\" Characteristically, he added, \"If it was a situation where we were going to win the World Series and I was the only player that they had left, I would put on the shoes.\"[79] Contrary to speculation,[80][81][82] Henderson's refusal to officially retire had not been delaying his eligibility for Hall of Fame induction. Since the 1970s, the five-year waiting period has been based on major league service only. Henderson was elected as part of the 2009 Hall of Fame vote, in his first appearance on the ballot. At a press conference two days after his election, the 50-year-old Henderson told reporters, \"I believe today, and people say I'm crazy, but if you gave me as many at-bats that you would give the runners out there today, I would outsteal every last one of them ... they can always ring my phone and I'll come on down and help their ballclub, that's how much I love the game.\"[83] In 2011, on the 20th anniversary of his record-breaking stolen base, the Oakland A's held \"Rickey Henderson Bobblehead Day.\" At Henderson's insistence, the giveaway plastic dolls had one atypical modification: \"I told them, put a little dirt on mine, make sure that [it looks] like I'm playing the game.\" Almost eight years after his final game, Henderson also reiterated his desire to return: \"Sometimes when I sit around and look at the game and things ain't going right, I just think, 'Just let me put on the uniform and go out there and take a chance'.\"[84] The New York Mets hired Henderson as a special instructor in 2006, primarily to work with hitters and to teach base stealing. Henderson's impact was noticeable on José Reyes, the Mets' former leadoff hitter.[85] \"I always want to be around the game,\" Henderson said in May 2007. \"That's something that's in my blood. Helping them have success feels just as good.\"[86] On July 13, 2007, the Mets promoted Henderson from special instructor to first base coach, replacing Howard Johnson, who became the hitting coach.[87] Henderson was not retained as a coach for 2008. Henderson had periodically been a special instructor in the Athletics' spring training camps. In 2010, he worked on base stealing (most notably with Rajai Davis and Coco Crisp) and outfield drills.[88] Sports Illustrated's Tom Verducci wrote in 2003, \"There are certain figures in American history who have passed into the realm of cultural mythology, as if reality could no longer contain their stories: Johnny Appleseed. Wild Bill Hickok. Davy Crockett. Rickey Henderson. They exist on the sometimes narrow margin between Fact and Fiction.\"[89] Henderson notably referred to himself in the third-person.[90][91] According to Verducci, during one off-season, Henderson called Padres general manager Kevin Towers and left this message: \"Kevin, this is Rickey. Calling on behalf of Rickey. Rickey wants to play baseball.\"[30] However, Henderson denied that this happened in a February 26, 2009, interview on Mike and Mike in the Morning.[92] In 2003, he discussed his unusual phraseology, saying, \"People are always saying, 'Rickey says Rickey.' But it's been blown way out of proportion. Rickey says it when Rickey doesn't do what Rickey needs to be doing. Rickey uses it to remind himself, like, 'Rickey, what you doing, you stupid. ... ' Rickey's just scolding himself.\"[71] Henderson did use the first person pronoun on occasion, such as when he defended his position during a contract dispute: \"All I'm asking for is what I want.\"[30] Henderson was so proud of a $1 million signing bonus that he framed it instead of cashing it, thus losing several months' interest.[93] Similarly, Henderson refused to spend his per diem money that all players receive on road trips: instead, he would put the envelopes containing the cash in a box, and when one of his children performed well in school he would invite them to choose an envelope out of the box and keep its contents. In 2002, following an argument with pitcher Orlando Hernández, Henderson stated, \"He needs to grow up a little bit. I ain't a kid. When I broke into the game, he was crawling on his hands and knees. Unless he's as old as I am. He probably is.\" (Hernández is approximately seven years younger.)[94] There are many unconfirmed stories about Henderson. A Padres teammate (variously reported as Steve Finley or Tony Gwynn) once offered him a seat anywhere on the bus, saying that Henderson had tenure. Henderson supposedly replied, \"Ten years? What are you talking about? Rickey got 16, 17 years.\"[95] One widely reported story was a fabrication that began as a clubhouse joke made by a visiting player.[95] While playing for Seattle in 2000, Henderson was said to have commented on first baseman John Olerud's practice of wearing a batting helmet while playing defense, noting that a former teammate in Toronto did the same thing. Olerud was reported to have replied, \"That was me.\" The two men had been together the previous season with the 1999 Mets, as well as with the 1993 World Champion Blue Jays. Several news outlets originally reported the story as fact.[96][97][98] Verducci wrote, \"Rickey is the modern-day Yogi Berra, only faster.\" Henderson himself was resigned to his persona: \"A lot of stuff they had me doing or something they said I had created, it's comedy. I guess that's how they want to judge me, as a character.\"[89] In 1983, Henderson married his high-school sweetheart, Pamela. They had three children: Angela, Alexis, and Adrianna.[12] Following a bout of pneumonia, Henderson died on December 20, 2024, five days before his 66th birthday.[99][100] He had been a patient at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center.[101] It took a long time, huh [Pause for cheers] First of all, I would like to thank God for giving me the opportunity. I want to thank the Haas family, the Oakland organization, the city of Oakland, and all you beautiful fans for supporting me. [Pause for cheers] Most of all, I'd like to thank my mom, my friends, and loved ones for their support. I want to give my appreciation to Tom Trebelhorn and the late Billy Martin. Billy Martin was a great manager. He was a great friend to me. I love you, Billy. I wish you were here. [Pause for cheers] Lou Brock was the symbol of great base stealing. But today, I'm the greatest of all time. Thank you. On May 1, 1991, Henderson stole his 939th base to pass Lou Brock and became the sport's all-time stolen base leader.[47] Henderson's speech after breaking Brock's record was similar to the standard victory or award speech. He thanked God and his mother, as well as the people that helped him in baseball. Because his idol was Muhammad Ali, Henderson decided to use the words \"greatest of all time.\"[103] These words have since been taken by many to support the notion that Henderson is selfish and arrogant,[104] although years later, Henderson revealed that he had gone over his planned remarks ahead of time with Brock, and the Cardinals Hall of Famer \"had no problem with it. In fact, he helped me write what I was going to say that day.\"[105] On the day of the speech, Brock later told reporters amiably, \"He spoke from his heart.\" Brock and Henderson had had a friendly relationship ever since their first meeting in 1981. Brock pronounced the young speedster as the heir to his record, saying, \"How are we gonna break it?\"[7] Henderson has mixed feelings about his comments: As soon as I said it, it ruined everything. Everybody thought it was the worst thing you could ever say. Those words haunt me to this day, and will continue to haunt me. They overshadow what I've accomplished in this game.[71] At the end of his July 2009 Hall of Fame induction, Henderson alluded to his earlier speech, saying:[106] In closing, I would like to say my favorite hero was Muhammad Ali. He said at one time, quote, 'I am the greatest,' end of quote. That is something I always wanted to be. And now that the Association has voted me into the Baseball Hall of Fame, my journey as a player is complete. I am now in the class of the greatest players of all time. And at this moment, I am ... [pause] ... very, very humble. Thank you. Asked if he believes the passage of time will improve his reputation, Henderson said: If you talk about baseball, you can't eliminate me, because I'm all over baseball... It's the truth. Telling the truth isn't being cocky. What do you want me to say, that I didn't put up the numbers? That my teams didn't win a lot of games? People don't want me to say anything about what I've done. Then why don't you say it? Because if I don't say it and you don't say it, nobody says it.[71] Henderson had 468 more stolen bases in his career than Brock, one short of 50% more than the game's second-most prolific basestealer.[107] In 1993, Henderson stole his 1,066th base, surpassing the world record established ten years earlier by Yutaka Fukumoto for the Hankyu Braves in Japan's Pacific League.[108] In his prime, Henderson had a virtual monopoly on the stolen base title in the American League. Between 1980 and 1991, he led the league in steals every season except 1987,[109] when he missed part of the season due to a nagging hamstring injury,[110] allowing Mariners second baseman Harold Reynolds to win the title. Henderson had one more league-leading season after that stretch, when his 66 steals in 1998 made him the oldest steals leader in baseball history. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Henderson also owns the record for times caught stealing (335). Due to incomplete historical recordkeeping for that statistic, though, it is unknown whether he is the actual career leader.[111] However, Henderson's overall 81% success rate on the basepaths is among the highest percentages in history.[112] (Carlos Beltran ranks first among players with at least 300 career attempts, at just over 86%.)[113] On July 29, 1989, Henderson stole five bases against the Mariners' left-handed Randy Johnson, his career high, and one shy of the single-game major league record. Unusually, Henderson was hitless in the game (he had four walks). Henderson had 18 four-steal games during his career. In August 1983, in a three-game series against the Brewers and a 2-game series versus the Yankees, Henderson had 13 stolen bases in five games. Baltimore Orioles third baseman Floyd Rayford described the confusion he felt during a particular game, when Henderson was leading off first base and signaling him with two fingers. Henderson quickly stole second base, then third, and Rayford understood the gesture.[30] Longtime scout Charlie Metro remembered the havoc caused by Henderson: '\"I did a lot of study and I found that it's impossible to throw Rickey Henderson out. I started using stopwatches and everything. I found it was impossible to throw some other guys out also. They can go from first to second in 2.9 seconds; and no pitcher catcher combination in baseball could throw from here to there to tag second in 2.9 seconds, it was always 3, 3.1, 3.2. So actually, the runner that can make the continuous, regular move like Rickey's can't be thrown out, and he's proven it.\"[114] Joe Posnanski of the Kansas City Star and Sports Illustrated wrote: I'm about to give you one of my all-time favorite statistics: Rickey Henderson walked 796 times in his career LEADING OFF AN INNING. Think about this again. There would be nothing, absolutely nothing, a pitcher would want to avoid more than walking Rickey Henderson to lead off an inning. And yet he walked SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY SIX times to lead off an inning. He walked more times just leading off in an inning than Lou Brock, Roberto Clemente, Luis Aparicio, Ernie Banks, Kirby Puckett, Ryne Sandberg and more than 50 other Hall of Famers walked in their entire careers... I simply cannot imagine a baseball statistic more staggering.[115] Henderson was a headfirst slider. In September 2008, Henderson discussed his base-stealing technique at length with Sports Illustrated: I wanted to know how to dive into the base because I was getting strawberries on my knees and strawberries on my ass... I was thinking about head-first versus feet-first, and wondering which would save my body. With head-first I worried about pounding my shoulders and my hands, and with feet-first I would worry about my knees and my legs. I felt that running was more important to me, with my legs, so I started going head-first. I got my [low-to-the-ground] technique from airplanes... I was on a plane and asleep and the plane bounced and when we landed we bounced and it woke me up. Then the next flight I had the same pilot and the plane went down so smooth. So I asked the pilot why, and he said when you land a plane smooth, you get the plane elevated to the lowest position you can and then you smooth it in. Same with sliding... If you dive when you're running straight up then you have a long distance to get to the ground. But the closer you get to the ground the less time it will take... I was hitting the dirt so smooth, so fast, when I hit the dirt, there wasn't no hesitation. It was like a skid mark, like you throw a rock on the water and skid off it. So when I hit the ground, if you didn't have the tag down, I was by you. No matter if the ball beat me, I was by you. That was what made the close plays go my way, I think.[116] Padres closer Trevor Hoffman said, \"I don't know how to put into words how fortunate I was to spend time around one of the icons of the game. I can't comprehend that yet. Years from now, though, I'll be able to say I played with Rickey Henderson, and I imagine it will be like saying I played with Babe Ruth.\"[30] When Henderson was 44 years old and playing for the Newark Bears in 2003, Padres general manager Kevin Towers said, \"I get e-mails daily from fans saying, 'Sign Rickey.'... I get more calls and e-mails about him than anybody... We've had some special players come through San Diego. But there's an aura about him nobody else has.\"[30] Tony La Russa, Henderson's manager in the late 1980s in Oakland, said, \"He rises to the occasion—the big moment—better than anybody I've ever seen.\"[30] Coach Rene Lachemann said, \"If you're one run down, there's nobody you'd ever rather have up at the plate than Rickey.\" Teammate Mitchell Page said, \"It wasn't until I saw Rickey that I understood what baseball was about. Rickey Henderson is a run, man. That's it. When you see Rickey Henderson, I don't care when, the score's already 1–0. If he's with you, that's great. If he's not, you won't like it.\"[26] A's pitching coach Dave Duncan said of Henderson, \"You have to be careful because he can knock one out. But you don't want to be too careful because he's got a small strike zone and you can't afford to walk him. And that's only half the problem. When he gets on base he's more trouble still.\" Sportswriter Tom Verducci wrote, \"Baseball is designed to be an egalitarian sort of game in which one player among the 18 is not supposed to dominate... Yet in the past quarter-century Henderson and Barry Bonds have come closest to dominating a baseball game the way Michael Jordan could a basketball game.\"[89] In July 2007, New York Sun sportswriter Tim Marchman wrote about Henderson's accomplishments: He stole all those bases and scored all those runs and played all those years not because of his body, but because of his brain. Rickey could tell from the faintest, most undetectable twitch of a pitcher's muscles whether he was going home or throwing over to first. He understood that conditioning isn't about strength, but about flexibility. And more than anyone else in the history of the game, he understood that baseball is entirely a game of discipline—the discipline to work endless 1–1 counts your way, the discipline to understand that your job is to get on base, and the discipline to understand that the season is more important than the game, and a career more important than the season. Maybe he'd get a bit more credit for all this if he were some boring drip like Cal Ripken Jr., blathering on endlessly about humility and apple pie and tradition and whatever else, but we're all better off with things the way they are... Everyone had their fun when he broke Lou Brock's stolen base record and proclaimed, 'I am the greatest', but he was, of course, just saying what was plainly true.\"[117] As of 2024[update], Henderson ranks first all-time in runs scored (2,295) and stolen bases (1,406), fourth in career games played (3,081), 13th in at bats (10,961), and 26th in hits (3,055). He has the second-highest career power–speed number, behind Barry Bonds, at 490.4.[118][119] His record for most career walks (2,190) has since been broken by Barry Bonds; Henderson is now second but continues to hold the record for most unintentional walks (2,129).[120] While his career batting average of .279 is considered somewhat modest for a leadoff hitter, his walks helped him post a stout .401 on-base percentage (OBP) for his career. He posted an OBP of at least .400 in 16 separate seasons, with a high mark of .439 in his 1990 MVP season. Henderson averaged 115 walks per 162 games over his career.[121] Henderson also holds the record for most home runs to lead off a game, with 81;[90] George Springer places a distant second with 56 career lead-off home runs. During the 2003 season, Henderson surpassed Babe Ruth for the career record in secondary bases (total bases compiled from extra base hits, walks, stolen bases, and times hit by pitch). In 1993, he led off both games of a doubleheader with homers. At the time of his last major league game, Henderson was still in the all-time top 100 home run hitters, with 297. Bill James wrote in 2000, \"Without exaggerating one inch, you could find fifty Hall of Famers who, all taken together, don't own as many records, and as many important records, as Rickey Henderson.\"[122] Henderson's eight steals during the 1989 ALCS broke Lou Brock's postseason record for a single series.[123][124] His record for the most postseason stolen bases was broken by Kenny Lofton's 34th career steal during the 2007 ALCS;[125] however, Lofton accomplished his total in 95 postseason games compared to Henderson's 60.[24][126] Henderson is the only American League player to steal more than 100 bases in a single season (having accomplished the feat three times), and he is the all-time stolen base leader for the Oakland A's.[24][127] In 1999, before breaking the career records for runs scored and walks, Henderson was ranked number 51 on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players,[128] and was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.[129] In 2005, The Sporting News updated their 100 Greatest Players list, and Henderson had inched up to number 50.[130] On January 12, 2009, Henderson was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year on the ballot, receiving 94.8% of the vote.[71] This was the 13th highest percentage in major league history.[131] Asked to choose the best player in history, Henderson declined, saying, \"There are guys who have done different things very well, but I don't know of anyone who mastered everything.\" Offered the chance to assess his own placement among the game's greats, he said, \"I haven't mastered the homers or RBI. The little things, I probably mastered.\" Of his various records and achievements, he values his career-runs-scored mark the most: \"You have to score to win.\"[132] Italics denotes active player",

                "content": "Statement from Pamela Henderson It is with profound sadness that we share the passing of my husband, Rickey Henderson. A legend on and off the field, Rickey was a devoted son, dad, friend, grandfather, brother, uncle, and a truly humble soul. Rickey lived his life with integrity, and his love for baseball was paramount. Now, Rickey is at peace with the Lord, cherishing the extraordinary moments and achievements he leaves behind. We are deeply grateful for the outpouring of love, support, and heartfelt memories from family, friends, and fans — all of which have brought immense comfort. We also extend our sincere gratitude to MLB, the Oakland A's, and the incredible doctors and nurses at UCSF who cared for Rickey with dedication and compassion. Your prayers and kindness mean more than words can express. In this difficult time, we kindly ask for your respect and privacy as we adjust to life without Rickey, holding on to the legacy he left for all of us. With gratitude,Pamela Henderson and his daughters Statement from the A’s Rickey Henderson is one of the greatest baseball players of all time. His on-field accomplishments speak for themselves, and his records will forever stand atop baseball history. He was undoubtedly the most legendary player in Oakland history and made an indelible mark on generations of A’s fans over his 14 seasons wearing the Green and Gold. For those who knew him personally, Rickey was much more than a franchise icon and a Baseball Hall of Famer. He was a friend and mentor to every player, coach, and employee who passed through the Oakland Coliseum or played a game on the field that came to bear his name. We are shocked and heartbroken by his passing. His loss will be felt not only by A’s fans but also by baseball fans around the world. The entire A's organization sends its sincere condolences to Rickey’s family and loved ones at this time. Statement from A’s Owner John Fisher Rickey was one of a kind. I’m shocked and deeply saddened by his passing, knowing we will no longer see this humble, smiling, and always approachable legend at Spring Training or in the clubhouse. He symbolized everything that is great about baseball and his hometown team, the Oakland Athletics. As Billy Beane shared with me, \"At 65, Rickey still looked ready to put on his uniform and lead off.\" I will miss him. My deepest condolences to his wife, daughters, family, and friends. Statement from A’s Senior Advisor to the Managing Partner Billy Beane Rickey was a teammate, a competitor, and someone I was lucky enough to work alongside and ultimately call a friend. He was the greatest Oakland A of all time and will deservedly be remembered that way by fans of baseball across the world. His impact on the A's, on Oakland, and on baseball is immeasurable, as he continued to affect the lives and careers of A's players and staff until the very end. My condolences go out, first and foremost, to his family for their loss, and to everyone who knew and admired Rickey. He will be greatly missed. Statement from A’s President Dave Kaval Rickey was a true original. One of the greats. He lived life the same way he played baseball, with a joy that inspired others. I was blessed to have him as a friend. I, like so many others, will miss him dearly. Statement from A’s Manager Mark Kotsay It was just an honor to wear the same uniform and to have him alongside us in the dugout and on the field. Rickey’s presence was felt everywhere in our clubhouse, and it’s hard to imagine the A’s without him around.",

                "content": "Watch CBS News By Lucia Suarez Sang Updated on: December 21, 2024 / 9:52 PM EST / CBS News Rickey Henderson, a Major League Baseball Hall of Famer and the league's all-time stolen bases leader, has died at age 65, MLB announced Saturday. MLB Commissioner Robert Manfred confirmed Henderson's death in a statement, calling him \"the gold standard of base stealing and leadoff hitting.\" \"Rickey was one of the most accomplished and beloved Athletics of all-time,\" Manfred wrote. \"He also made an impact with many other Clubs during a quarter-century career like no other. Rickey epitomized speed, power and entertainment in setting the tone at the top of the lineup. When we considered new rules for the game in recent years, we had the era of Rickey Henderson in mind.\" Henderson would have been 66 on Christmas Day. No cause of death was immediately provided. Henderson's wife, Pamela Henderson, released a statement through the Oakland Athletics in which she described her husband as \"a devoted son, dad, friend, grandfather, brother, uncle, and a truly humble soul.\" She also extended the family's \"sincere gratitude to MLB, the Oakland A's, and the incredible doctors and nurses at UCSF who cared for Rickey with dedication and compassion. Your prayers and kindness mean more than words can express.\" The Chicago native, nicknamed the \"Man of Steal,\" was one of the greatest players to don the A's jersey and was widely considered to be one of the best leadoff hitters and base stealers in the sport's history. During his 25-year career, he compiled 2,055 hits, 297 home runs and 1,115 RBIs. His 1,406 stolen bases and 2,295 career runs remain Major League records. He was a 10-time All-Star and won the league MVP in 1990 with the A's, where he played the bulk of his career — 14 years over four different stints. He also spent seven years in New York — five with the Yankees and two with the Mets. He played with several other teams including the San Diego Padres, Toronto Blue Jays, Anaheim Angels, Seattle Mariners, Boston Red Sox and Los Angeles Dodgers. Henderson won two World Series titles, one with Oakland in 1989, and again with Toronto in 1993. After retiring from playing, Henderson coached one year with the Mets. He was inducted into Cooperstown as a first-ballot Hall of Famer in 2009, and just six days later, the A's retired his jersey. Lucia Suarez Sang is an associate managing editor at CBSNews.com.

                "content": "Justin Louis Baldoni (born January 24, 1984)[1] is an American actor and filmmaker. Baldoni started his career as an actor portraying Rafael Solano on the CW satirical telenovela Jane the Virgin (2014–2019). He has since gone on to direct the romance drama films Five Feet Apart (2019), Clouds (2020) and It Ends with Us (2024), the later of which he also starred in playing a domestic abuser and neurosurgeon.[2] Baldoni was born in Los Angeles, California, and was raised in Medford, Oregon, the son of Sharon and Sam Baldoni.[3] His mother is from a Jewish family,[4] and his father is of Italian ancestry. His paternal grandfather is Louis Baldoni, an Indiana senator and Italian immigrant.[5] Baldoni's parents joined the Baháʼí Faith, which Baldoni practices devoutly.[6][7] Baldoni played soccer and ran track in high school, and was a radio disc jockey at a local top-40 radio station. While moving into a new apartment building, Baldoni met a manager who advised him to pursue a career in acting.[8] He attended college on a partial athletic scholarship, but later dropped out.[9] Baldoni made his acting debut in the soap opera The Young and the Restless in 2004. In 2008, Baldoni wrote, produced, and directed his first music video that was selected and won him his first \"Audience Choice Award\" at Dawn Breakers International Film Festival.[10] In 2012, Baldoni created a digital documentary series, My Last Days, a show about living—as told by the dying.[11][12] The show eventually became one of the most-watched YouTube documentary series streamed online.[13] The second season of My Last Days aired on CW and third season was released in the winter of 2018. On the heels of that success Baldoni founded Wayfarer Entertainment, a digital media studio focused on disruptive inspiration.[14] In December 2018, Baldoni spoke at the annual End Well Symposium about why he believes that thinking about our death can help us live better.[15] From 2014 to 2019, Baldoni played Rafael Solano in the CW satirical telenovela Jane the Virgin starring opposite Gina Rodriguez.[16] In May 2016 he launched a time-lapse video app for pregnant women and new moms called Belly Bump.[17] In 2018 he played a young Barry Minkow in the crime drama Con Man, directed by Bruce Caulk. Baldoni directed and produced CBS Films' Five Feet Apart, starring Cole Sprouse and Haley Lu Richardson, and based on an original script by Mikki Daughtry and Tobias Iaconis. The film was released on March 15, 2019, and chronicles the lives of two teenagers living with cystic fibrosis.[18] The film was a financial success but received mixed reviews.[19][20] The following year he directed and produced Clouds, a film depicting the life of musician Zach Sobiech with Warner Bros.[21][22] On May 14, 2020, it was announced Disney+ had acquired distribution rights to the film from Warner Bros., in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the film industry. It was released on October 16, 2020.[23] In 2024 Baldoni directed, produced, and starred in the romantic drama It Ends with Us, based on Colleen Hoover's novel of the same name.[24] In the film, in which he acted opposite Blake Lively, Baldoni portrays a neurosurgeon who is a domestic abuser. The film bacame a box office hit, earning over $350 million, but it received mixed reviews from critics.[25][26] Baldoni and Lively had a combative working relationship on the set, with Lively accusing him of sexually harassing her and creating a toxic workplace environment. When The New York Times investigated the incident, it revealed private messages from Baldoni orchestrated a smear campaign against her. Baldoni hired a PR crisis firm in order to \"bury her\" through social media platforms such as Tiktok, Reddit, and X after Lively accused him of misconduct.[27] In July 2017, Variety announced that Baldoni was developing a male talk show through his media company Wayfarer Entertainment. The show, entitled Man Enough, is described as a disruptive panel series that explores what it means to be a man today.[28] In an interview, Baldoni described the reason he created the show. \"Man Enough really came about because I wanted to take a dive into what it really means to be a man, and this question of 'do we have it right?'\"[29] The show includes men like Matt McGorry and Javier Muñoz.[30] In August 2017, TED announced Baldoni would be a speaker at the annual TEDWomen Conference.[31] In 2021, Baldoni released a book under the same premise as his previous talk show and TED Talk titled Man Enough: Undefining My Masculinity.[32] He began a podcast series under the same name with co-hosts Liz Plank and Jamey Heath. A children's version of the book Boys Will Be Human was released in October 2022.[33] Baldoni co-founded a production company called Wayfarer Entertainment that produces television, films, and digital content. In 2019, Wayfarer sold a majority stake in the company to investment fund 4S Bay Partners, setting up a $25 million content fund,[34][35] and was renamed Wayfarer Studios in 2020.[36] The philanthropic branch of the company, called the Wayfarer Foundation, benefits homeless residents of Los Angeles.[37] They host an annual Skid Row Carnival of Love, which provides resources for employment, education, non-emergency medical care, food, clothing, hygiene, and other festivities such as face-painting, live concerts, and children's activities, serving over 4,000 homeless guests each year.[38] After almost two years of dating, Baldoni married Swedish actress Emily Fuxler, now known as Emily Baldoni, in July 2013 in Corona, California.[39] They have a daughter[40] and a son.[41] Baldoni has stated that he has ADHD.[42][43] In December 2024, Blake Lively sued Baldoni, with whom she co-starred in It Ends with Us (2024), for sexual harassment and for causing her family \"severe emotional distress\". According to the suit, Lively claimed she was in a hostile work environment. Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, had sit-down meetings with Wayfarer Studios to address their demands of Baldoni, which were reported to include \"not showing nude videos or images of women to Lively; no more mentions of Baldoni's alleged previous 'pornography addiction'; no more discussions about sexual experiences in front of Lively and others; no further mentions of cast and crew's genitalia; and no more inquiries about Lively's weight.\"[44][45] Baldoni has denied the accusations.[46] In response to the allegations the talent agency WME dropped Baldoni as a client.[47]",

He played college football at Alabama A&M, Independence Community College, and Houston. Dell attended Mainland High School in Daytona Beach, Florida.[1] He had originally committed to Florida International University (FIU) to play college football but attended Alabama A&M University instead.[2][3] After one year at Alabama A&M in which he had 12 receptions for 364 yards and three touchdowns, he transferred to Independence Community College.[4] In his lone year at Independence, he had 52 receptions for 766 yards and eight touchdowns.[5][1] Dell transferred to the University of Houston in 2020.[6] In his first year at Houston, he led the team with 29 receptions for 428 yards and three touchdowns over eight games.[7] In 2021, he again led the team with 90 receptions for 1,329 yards with 12 touchdowns.[8][9] He returned to Houston as the number one receiver in 2022, during which he made 100 receptions for 1,398 receiving yards and 17 receiving touchdowns in only 13 games played. Dell was drafted by the Houston Texans in the third round, 69th overall, of the 2023 NFL draft.[12] In Week 11 against the Arizona Cardinals, Dell caught a career-high eight passes for a career-high 149 yards, and one touchdown.[13] In Week 13 against the Denver Broncos, Dell suffered a fractured fibula and was ruled out for the rest of the season. He went under surgery to repair the fibula the next day.[14][15] He finished the season with 47 catches for 709 yards and seven touchdowns, which was among the rookie leaders at the time of the injury.[16] In Week 9 of the 2024 season, against the New York Jets, Dell had six receptions for 126 yards in the 21–13 loss.[17] In Week 15 of the 2024 season against the Kansas City Chiefs, Tank suffered a season ending knee injury after catching a touchdown pass from C.J.

Dell immediately pointed to his knee while on the ground and was unable to get up on his own, which resulted in him getting carted into an ambulance. He was brought to University of Kansas Medical Center at a level one trauma center, 12 miles from Arrowhead, according to the NBC broadcast. After the game, head coach DeMeco Ryans provided an update on the wide receiver, saying Dell will remain in the Kansas City hospital overnight for further evaluation of the \"significant\" knee injury. \"Just all our thoughts and prayers are with Tank right now ... it hurts to see him go down like that.

Tank Dell comes down with a touchdown, but Jared Wayne inadvertently runs into his knee, leaving the Texans emotional for their teammate. (0:35) KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Houston Texans wideout Tank Dell was carted off the field with what coach DeMeco Ryans later called a \"significant\" knee injury after he caught a touchdown pass from quarterback C.J. Stroud in the third quarter of Saturday's 27-19 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. Dell was taken to University of Kansas Hospital, a Level 1 trauma center about 12 miles from Arrowhead Stadium. A source told ESPN that Dell dislocated his kneecap, confirming an NFL Network report. Any other potential injuries to the knee weren't immediately known. Ryans said Dell would remain at the hospital overnight for further evaluation. \"All our thoughts and prayers are with Tank right now,\" Ryans said. \"You guys can see what he means to our entire team.\" On the Texans' first possession of the second half, Stroud threw a 30-yard touchdown pass to Dell to cut Kansas City's lead to 17-16. But on the reception, Houston wideout Jared Wayne collided with Dell's lower leg deep in the end zone, and Dell immediately grabbed his leg but otherwise barely moved. The Texans hovered around Dell and a few players broke into tears before his leg was placed in an air cast and he was lifted into the back of the cart. The second-year wideout out of Houston was playing a major role against the Chiefs, as he had a team-high 98 yards on seven catches with the touchdown. \"It hurts to see him go down like that,\" Ryans said. \"He was having a fantastic game.\" Houston had three possessions after Dell was hurt and scored only three points. The unit got the ball with 5:13 left and trailing 27-19, but after two negative plays, Stroud was sacked on third down, leading to a punt. The Chiefs' offense subsequently picked up multiple first downs and ran out the clock. Stroud, who shed tears after the injury, sent out his prayers to Dell postgame. \"It's not easy seeing your brother go down like that,\" Stroud said. \"I'm just tore up. \"But at the same time, I got to be strong for him. For anything, whether it goes left or right, up or down, I have to praise my Lord and savior. It's not easy, but after [the injury], I try to use it as motivation; it's not easy to just let it go. That's my best friend. It's not easy to move on and just keep playing. I tried to do the best that I could. My teammates helped me up, Joe [Mixon] helped me up and Dalton [Schultz]. I appreciate the guys just talking to me because I was going through it.\" Texans wideout Nico Collins, who finished with seven catches for 60 yards, struggled to find words to express his emotions postgame. \"That s--- hurts. It hurts. We know how much he meant to this team,\" Collins said of Dell. \"But losing one of your brothers, man, it hurts. Speedy recovery for my dog. Mentally, he's going through it, but we have to keep stepping, keep climbing for him.\" Dell's rookie season in 2023 was cut short after he suffered a broken leg in an early-December game against the Denver Broncos. In late April, he was shot at a private event in Sanford, Florida, where authorities said a teenage gunman injured 10 people after an altercation. Dell's wound was minor, and he was released from the hospital shortly after the shooting. Dell has 667 receiving yards and three touchdowns on the season. Dell's injury was the third major lower leg injury for the Texans on the afternoon. Guard Shaq Mason suffered a knee injury during a pileup in the first quarter. He limped off but was ruled out shortly afterward. Safety Jimmie Ward injured a foot in the second quarter and was carted off. The Texans have only three full days to recover from the loss, as they will host the Baltimore Ravens on Christmas Day.",

Tyson Fury spent a decade and a half and 35 professional fights without suffering defeat, he has now lost back-to-back fights to Oleksandr Usyk. The native of Ukraine won their fantastic, high-pace second fight by unanimous decision on Saturday in Saudi Arabia to remain WBO, WBA and WBC world champion.. Momentum swung wildly for the first half of the bout, with Fury landing hard jabs and occasional right hands while Usyk focused his attack on Fury's body. Despite Fury weighing in at more than 280 pounds for the fight, the constant Usyk body attack never fully slowed Fury down. What did turn the tables was Usyk's left hand from his southpaw stance. That shot landed with increased frequency as the fight wore on and led to Fury backing into the ropes more often in the second half of the fight. This was similar to their first meeting in May, when Fury fought brilliantly early before Usyk took the fight over, including scoring a knockdown in Round 9 of that bout. Fury didn't suffer a knockdown in the rematch, but did struggle to keep up with Usyk's pace and pressure. Usyk was also brilliantly sharp with his punch selection, landing 179 of 423 punches to 144 of 509 for Fury. At the conclusion of 12 rounds, the ringside judges turned in identical scores of 116-112, though they did not have consensus on which rounds each man won, something Fury promoter Frank Warren took issue with while claiming his fighter deserved the nod. Both fights between Usyk and Fury are in the Fight of the Year discussion for 2024 and the Fury that showed up on Saturday night would likely defeat every heavyweight on the planet not named Oleksandr Usyk. \"He's a great fighter and a great opponent,\" Usyk said after the fight. \"It's a great fight for 24 rounds, unbelievable 24 rounds in my career.\" Asked about what's next in his career, Usyk delivered a line in broken English in his classic deadpan style. \"I can more,\" Usyk said. Usyk's post-fight interview was interrupted by IBF champion Daniel Dubois. Usyk defeated Dubois by knockout in 2023 and it was Dubois who picked up the IBF title after Usyk was stripped by the sanctioning body for going ahead with his contractually obligated rematch with Fury. \"I want my revenge,\" Dubois said as he grabbed the microphone. \"I want my revenge, Usyk. Well done tonight. I want my revenge.\" Usyk said he was willing to go through with the rematch, telling Turki Alalshikh to make the fight. Should that fight materialize -- Dubois is scheduled to defend his title against Joseph Parker on Feb. 22 -- Usyk would have a chance to become a two-time undisputed heavyweight champion. He moved to the heavyweight division in 2019 after a cruiserweight career that saw him go undisputed at that weight. The undercard saw a pair of rising prospects pick up vicious knockouts and improve their resumes. Moses Itauma, the teenage heavyweight phenom, took care of veteran Demsey McKean in brutal fashion, scoring a first-round knockout. Junior middleweight Serhii Bohachuk managed to do the same in a showdown with Ismael Davis after some incredible back-and-forth action before the fight was called off in the sixth round. Bohachuk was originally scheduled to face Israil Madrimov, but Madrimov withdrew from the fight just weeks out after coming down with bronchitis.

                "title": "Fury vs Usyk 2: Oleksandr Usyk outpoints Tyson Fury to retain unified heavyweight world titles - BBC Sport",
                "content": "This video can not be played Usyk cements legacy with points win over Fury Oleksandr Usyk defeated Tyson Fury to retain his unified heavyweight world titles and prove his status as a generational great with another close points win in their rematch in Saudi Arabia. Having inflicted a first career defeat on Briton Fury by split decision in May, Usyk's astuteness and will to win once again prevailed at Riyadh's Kingdom Arena as he retained his WBA (Super), WBC and WBO titles. Fury, 36, found success in the first half of the fight. Some of the more eye-catching shots came from the Morecambe fighter, but the volume of punches and cleaner work were from Ukrainian Usyk. All three judges scored it 116-112 to the 37-year-old champion. Usyk, an Olympic gold medallist and former undisputed cruiserweight champion, extended his undefeated record to 23 pro wins. \"He [Tyson Fury] is a great fighter, he is a great opponent. An unbelievable 24 rounds for my career. Thank you so much,\" Usyk said. Two-time world champion Fury has only ever lost to Usyk, his two defeats the major blemishes on a record also consisting of 34 wins and one draw. Fury left the ring without conducting an interview, before IBF world champion Daniel Dubois climbed in and called for a rematch with Usyk. A visibly frustrated figure in the moments after the scorecards were read out, Fury said backstage he was convinced he won the fight by \"at least three rounds\". This video can not be played 'No doubt I won the fight' - Fury disputes loss to Usyk Game-changers Fury & Usyk have defined an era - what next? 'Judges gave Usyk Christmas gift' - Fury reacts to loss 'Really disappointed' - relive Usyk's win over Fury in rematch Oleksandr Usyk remains unbeaten as a professional, with his last defeat coming in 2009 in the amateur ranks In a rematch billed as Usyk v Fury 'reignited', the sport's two most technically gifted heavyweights served up another classic which showcased elite level boxing. The Gypsy King was in playful mood with an unorthodox ring entrance to Mariah Carey's 'All I Want For Christmas Is You'. Dressed as Father Christmas, Fury was still sporting the bushy beard which was cleared at a rules meeting amid protests from Usyk's team. A stern-faced Usyk marched to the ring in super-quick time. Wearing a warrior-like robe, he crouched in the corner to recite a prayer. After an 11-minute face-off on Thursday, Fury and Usyk picked up where they left off, their eyes fixated on each other as they met in the centre of the ring. Usyk's narrow win over Fury in pictures Neither man over-committed in a cagey opening round. Fury showboated his way through the first fight but there was more seriousness to his work here. He wobbled Usyk in the closing seconds of the second. With an advantage of six inches in height, eight inches in reach and four stone in weight, Fury used his physicality to keep Usyk at range. But just as he did in the first fight, Usyk found success targeting Fury's body. Two bruising left hooks landed flush on Fury in the fourth. \"Keep it basic. He's running around - slow it down,\" trainer SugarHill Steward told Fury after the fifth. An overhand left connected cleanly with Fury's forehead in the sixth. Fury's pace dropped and Usyk was heading into his groove. Fury found a second wind, however, and edged the ninth. It felt as if it was still all to play for in the championship rounds. Model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and actor husband Jason Statham watched from plush ringside seats, alongside a stellar list of boxing royalty including Roberto Duran, Lennox Lewis and Prince Naseem Hamed. Usyk unleashed a sublime combination in the 11th. With Fury momentarily hurt, the champion applied the pressure. And Fury looked the more desperate of the pair as Usyk finished the fight on top. This video can not be played I respect Fury, but Warren is 'blind' - Usyk on controversial win Two close defeats by a fighter of Usyk's calibre do not point to a sharp decline in Fury's ability. On another day, with another set of judges, it may have been a different result. \"I'm really disappointed. We'll have to see what happens in the future for Tyson. I thought he was in control, boxed really well and had Usyk on his back foot,\" promoter Frank Warren said. Fury is an enigma: a boxer who - even when he refuses to engage with the media or sell a fight as he did this week - is able to emit a certain energy and draw in a crowd. Anthony Joshua is also at a crossroads after a destructive defeat by Dubois. Now may be the perfect time for the long-awaited all-British heavyweight tussle. Usyk, meanwhile, can rightly call the shots on his next move. Dubois, who was stopped by Usyk last year, still harbours a grudge after the referee's decision to rule a punch which dropped the Ukrainian earlier in the fight as a low blow. Usyk has also previously hinted he could move back down to cruiserweight. The discipline it would take to lose the weight and recondition himself is indicative of a man forever chasing greatness and new challenges. The Crimea-born fighter certainly has options, but the best of his era is running out of credible opponents.

                "title": "FC Barcelona 1-2 Atlético Madrid: Heartbreaking",
                "content": "First Team Club Tickets & Museum Download the official FC Barcelona App FC Barcelona have suffered a third consecutive home defeat in Liga. And this was perhaps the cruellest of all. In one of those games that are impossible to fathom, they played delightful football from start to finish, while Atlético were just a shadow of the side they had been bigged up to be in the build-up to Saturday’s fixture. Barça fans will be going home tonight wondering how on earth it happened, but they lost. When Pedri had given the Catalans the lead after half an hour, it was a fair reflection of the utter blaugrana domination we had enjoyed. On the back of footballing brilliance, there were plenty more chances where that came from, but the visitors managed to scramble an equaliser in practically their only attack of the entire 90 minutes of regular time play. Unfazed, Barça kept pressing, but the winner just didn’t want to come, and in the final minute of injury time, Atlético stunned the Estadi Olimpic with a late winner. It was the first time since 2006 that Barça have lost at home to Atlético, and the result means that today’s winners go three points clear at the top of the table, and with a game in hand. If Real Madrid win on Sunday, Barça would drop down to third after collecting just five of the last 21 points on offer. It’s not a great situation to be in, made all the more frustrating by the fact that today’s defeat was so utterly unwarranted. Barça had underperformed in their last two home fixtures, but there were no signs of recent shortcomings when this game got under way. All the energy and ideas that were lacking against Las Palmas and Leganés were back on display, and pretty much the entire first half was constant blaugrana pressure. Raphinha came especially close to scoring before and an extremely busy Jan Oblak was finally beaten just before the half hour. He was having a class game, but Gavi failed to fully control Pedri’s pass. Luckily for him, he inadvertently positioned the ball perfectly for the Canary Islander to finish off the move and put Barça ahead. Nobody could argue that the lead was anything less than Barça deserved. They were well and truly bossing this in every department. Unable to keep the ball long enough to create any danger of their own, Atlético were utterly overwhelmed at the back, making numerous unforced errors, and being made to look nothing like a side that had come into this game on a run of 11 straight victories. But football can be a very cruel sport. Moments after Raphinha had lobbed the most exquisite of long balls from Pedri onto the bar, Atlético somehow managed to equalise. A rare mistake from Marc Casadó and Rodrigo De Paul found himself in a position to shoot. With practically their first meaningful attack of the game, the visitors were back level. A goal like that often changes the dynamic of a game. Not this time. It was still all Barça, and the Estadi Olimpic was possibly the loudest its ever been, as the fans willed the team to get the second goal and do justice to what they were witnessing. Robert Lewandowski had it. But he fumbled a wonderful opportunity, and in the move that immediately followed had it not been for a superlative Iñaki Peña, Pablo Barrios could have earned Atlético a mystifying lead. The pace of this game had been relentless all the way, and the final minutes were more intense still. Barça piled forward, but time and again they came up against an inspired Oblak in the visiting goal. Atlético looked exhausted, but their Slovenian keeper was keeping them in the game. It was agonising to watch. Barça so, so deserved to be winning this. They certainly didn’t deserve to lose it. But in the dying minutes of injury time, as they were desperately giving it one last go, Barça were caught on the break. Alexander Sørloth was there to convert. Atlético had no idea how they had won this. And Barça had no idea how they had lost. Heartbreaking.",

                "content": "DOWNLOAD OUR APPS Atlético Madrid defeated FC Barcelona 2-1 in the 18th round of La Liga, with goals from Rodrigo De Paul and Alexander Sorloth for Atlético. Pedri scored for Barcelona. In an emotional clash, Atlético de Madrid stunned FC Barcelona with a last-minute comeback (1-2) in Matchday 18 of LaLiga. The winning goal came in the 96th minute from Alexander Sorloth, who capitalized on a counterattack to give the Colchoneros their twelfth consecutive win, while also snatching the top spot in the league from Barça, who now sit in second place. Barcelona's Dominance and Football’s Justice From the start, FC Barcelona dominated the game, with Pedri pulling the strings in midfield and a fluid style of play creating several clear chances. The pressure from Raphinha and his crosses for Lewandowski continuously troubled the Atlético defense, who struggled to maintain possession. In the 30th minute, Barcelona's dominance paid off when Pedri combined with Gavi and scored the opening goal with a precise cross-shot. Despite Barcelona’s control, Atlético stayed afloat thanks to Jan Oblak's key interventions and Barcelona’s inability to capitalize on important moments. The team led by Xabi Flick failed to make the most of their superiority, missing clear chances such as Raphinha's crossbar or Fermín’s missed one-on-one opportunity. Atlético's Comeback The second half began with more opportunities for Barça, but it was Atlético who took their first clear chance in the 61st minute. A pass from Julián Álvarez to Rodrigo De Paul, who curled in a stunning goal from outside the box, equalized the score. Although Barcelona tried to regain control with the introduction of Dani Olmo, their chances continued to be squandered. In the final minutes, Oblak kept his team alive with key saves against Olmo, Raphinha, and Pedri. However, football had one last surprise in store: in the 96th minute, Raphinha lost possession of the ball, and Atlético launched a deadly counterattack, which Sorloth finished off to score the winner, sending the Atlético bench into a frenzy. A Bitter End for Barcelona Atlético de Madrid took the three points and now leads LaLiga with 41 points, while FC Barcelona drops to second place with 38 points. The Blaugrana end the year on a sour note, having earned only five points from their last seven matches after having a substantial lead at the top of the table. With this result, Atlético Madrid climbs to the top of La Liga, taking the first spot from Barcelona with 41 points, while Barcelona drops to second with 38 points. DOWNLOAD OUR APPS",

                "title": "Aston Villa 2-1 Man City (Dec 21, 2024) Game Analysis - ESPN",
                "content": "Janusz Michallik believes Erling Haaland is \"absolutely useless\" when he doesn't have proper service following Manchester City's 2-1 loss to Aston Villa. Aston Villa inflicted more misery on shell-shocked Manchester City on Saturday, beating them 2-1 in the Premier League with goals from Jhon Durán and former City forward Morgan Rogers. Villa rose above City into fifth place in the Premier League table, and the title holders dropped provisionally to sixth with their ninth loss in 12 games across all competitions. While Pep Guardiola's team could fall to as low as ninth by the end of the weekend and have just one victory to show from that 12-game stretch, the manager remains optimistic results will come. \"It can come, it can not come,\" Guardiola told the BBC. \"It depends on us. The solution is bring the players back [from injuries]. We have just one central defender fit, that is difficult. We are going to try next game -- another opportunity and we don't think much further than that.\" In a rip-roaring start, Villa almost scored inside 20 seconds when Duran pounced on a poor ball by Josko Gvardiol but his shot was pushed away by a diving Stefan Ortega. Ortega made another fine save from the corner that followed, batting Pau Torres' shot away off the crossbar. The narrow miss was a sign of things to come. Duran, 21, got the home side on the score sheet in the 16th minute when Youri Tielemans sent a sumptuous through ball to Rogers, whose unselfish pass found Duran free to fire home. It was a another statement for a permanent spot in the starting 11 by former Villa super-sub Duran, who started for the third successive league game, and has scored in all three. He also had a goal chalked off for offside on Saturday. \"We are in the process with the players [strikers Duran and Ollie Watkins], keeping their consistency of playing,\" Villa manager Unai Emery told TNT Sports. \"Jhon Duran today played fantastic, Watkins is fantastic as well, very important for us. Of course you have to work with both strikers, sometimes they play together. I am very happy with them.\" Villa Park erupted again in the 65th minute when Rogers latched on to a pass from captain John McGinn and finished with a low hard shot, leaving Guardiola to shake his head in frustration. \"It's like a beast, really,\" Rogers told TNT Sports of City. \"Because obviously they haven't had the results and we knew they would come out firing and they wouldn't want to win the game. We knew if we stuck to the game plan, and we showed our quality we would cause problems, and to a man, I thought we were outstanding.\" Phil Foden pulled one back for City in stoppage time with his first league goal of the season after a mistake by Villa's Lucas Digne, but it was too little too late for the visitors. Foden had City's best chances, including one in the first half that tested Villa's World Cup winning goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez after a one-two with Rico Lewis. \"We are disappointed, it's not good enough,\" City striker Erling Haaland told TNT. \"It's not good enough from me.\"",

They could find themselves 12 points adrift of league leaders Liverpool by Christmas depending on results later this weekend. Full commentary and highlights | Team news and lineups Venue: Villa Park, BirminghamReferee: Peter Bankes Keep track of every game and every goal via SN's live Premier League scoreboard Starting lineups: Aston Villa (4-3-3, right to left): 23. Emiliano Martinez (GK) — 2. Matty Cash, 4. Ezri Konsa, 14. Pau Torres, 12. Lucas Digne — 8. Youri Tielemans, 44. Boubacar Kamara, 24. Amadou Onana — 7. John McGinn, 9. Jhon Duran (11.

Erling Haaland MORE: All the latest Man City news | Premier League schedule for 2024/25 | Latest Premier League top scorer rankings Villa had three golden chances to score inside the opening three minutes, Duran forcing a save from Stefan Ortega — in for the absent Ederson — before the City keeper produced a remarkable reflex save to stop the ball being glanced in from the resulting corner. Amadou Onana then headed over the bar from close range. Duran made the most of his next opportunity, though, side-footing past Ortega after being set up by Rogers following a quite wonderful through ball from the outstanding Youri Tielemans. City dominated possession in the first half but found little joy against Villa's organised defence, with a misdirected Josko Gvardiol header from Jack Grealish's cross the closest they game to an equaliser. Villa took a more front-foot approach after halftime and should have doubled their lead before the hour. Matty Cash fired into the side netting instead of crossing for Boubacar Kamara for a tap-in, and Rogers drilled a shot off the outside of the left-hand post. Rogers made no mistake with his next chance. Having started the move with a strong midfield run that left Mateo Kovacic for dead, he received a pass from John McGinn and fired a left-foot strike into the bottom-right corner, with Ortega motionless in his goal. City heads seemed to drop and Villa looked the more likely to get the game's third goal, with substitute Ollie Watkins shooting straight at Ortega with a presentable opportunity. At the other end, Erling Haaland threw himself despairingly at a looping cross, having spent the whole game on the fringes. Foden ended his long wait for a Premier League goal when he slotted past Emiliano Martinez after Lucas Digne had slipped on the loose ball in the Villa box, but by that stage, a comeback felt implausible. City are now on a worse run of form than Erik ten Hag's Manchester United were before the Dutchman was sacked in late October. Guardiola will almost certainly not face the same fate, but quite how he turns things around this season is hard to fathom. That's that! City don't have time for a comeback. It's yet another defeat for Guardiola's team. 90+2 mins: GOAL! FODEN GETS ONE BACK! Savinho runs well with the ball and finds his teammate, who has a shot blocked but gets the ball back thanks to Lucas Digne's slip. Foden then has a simple finish into the bottom-right corner. Can they rescue a result?

The champions are running out of time here. 82 mins: Rogers races away from Walker and plays a reverse pass to substitute Ollie Watkins, who shots straight at Ortega on his weaker foot. Guardiola throws his hands up and turns away in disgust. 79 mins: Villa are on the hunt for a third goal. City are very passive without the ball right now. It's not a good watch for any fans. 72 mins: Savinho is on for Ilkay Gundogan as Guardiola rolls the dice to try to get back into this game. 65 mins: GOAL! NO MISTAKE FROM ROGERS THIS TIME! The outstanding Tielemans combines well with McGinn, who sets up Rogers to drill a low shot past the motionless Ortega. Villa are in complete control now!

Gvardiol isn't strong enough with a challenge in his own box and the ball falls kindly the Rogers, whose low shot crashes off the outside of the left-hand post. He should really have hit the target. 57 mins: Akanji is going to continue, although he doesn't look entirely comfortable. 56 mins: Akanji makes a good sliding challenge on Duran, and both men stay down. Akanji looks to have landed awkwardly on his shoulder. This is the last thing City need right now. Duran is back up and looks okay. 53 mins: Onana, who has looked a bit of a passenger in the Villa midfield at times today, accidentally stands on the back of Foden's ankle. That looked a painful one for the City man, although he's back up on his feet. 51 mins: Duran smashes a finish past Ortega after being played through by Tielemans, but the flag goes up, and the striker seemed to be expecting it. He was indeed offside, although not by a lot. 49 mins: BIG CHANCE WASTED BY CASH! More brilliant Tielemans work in midfield sets up another swift attack. McGinn plays it to the overlapping Cash, who blasts the ball into the side-netting of Ortega's goal when Kamara was waiting in the middle for a tap-in! 47 mins: Rico Lewis is booked for stopping Tielemans on the counter. The City man has moved to left-back, with Walker on the right of the defence and Gvardiol partnering Akanji in the centre. City have made a change at the break: Kyle Walker is on for John Stones. The half ends as Grealish is halted by Cash again, and the City man then gets into a heated argument with Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez, who has gone into the book. 43 mins: BIG CHANCE FOR GVARDIOL! The defender leads a City break, finds Grealish and continues his run into the box. Grealish's cross lands right on the full-back's head, but he's stretching for the ball and can't keep his attempt on target. 41 mins: The game has entered a bit of a lull. City are still struggling to pick their way through Villa, and the hosts have had a couple of chances to break quickly without making the most of them. 35 mins: City offer a glimpse of what they can do at their best, with Foden and Lewis combining well with some slick passes, but Martinez is equal to the former's shot. Duran clears the first corner, and the second is rather wasted. 27 mins: Gvardiol plays a teasing cross towards Haaland, but Pau Torres is able to clear. City are focusing all their attacks down the left at the moment. 23 mins: We're back into City possession and deep Villa defending, but so far, the home side are quite comfortable. City haven't got the ball to Haaland in any dangerous positions yet. 16 mins: GOAL! DURAN PUTS VILLA AHEAD! The No. 9 has a simple side-footed finish from the middle of the box after Morgan Rogers had squared it. But that all came from a simply wonderful throughball from Youri Tielemans, who came to receive a pass from his goalkeeper, turned away from pressure, and threaded the ball quite magnificently through City's defence and into Rogers' path.

The visitors have settled now, but the hosts are defending their box well. 9 mins: Grealish has had a lively start against his old club. Villa fans cheer as he is felled by Matty Cash, but this is a free-kick in a decent position for City. Villa just about clear their lines in the end. 3 mins: Amadou Onana has a near free header and sends it over the bar. That's another chance gone for Villa, and we've only had three minutes! 2 mins: HOW HAS THAT STAYED OUT? The corner is glanced on and Ortega gets fingertips to the ball to claw it away at the near post, and Erling Haaland clears. The referee signals that the ball did not cross the line — but boy, that was close. That's how close Aston Villa came to opening the scoring inside 2 minutes against Man City 👀📺 @tntsports & @discoveryplusUK pic.twitter.com/jGQVWA9L93 1 min: VILLA SHOULD BE AHEAD! Josko Gvardiol is caught on the ball by John McGinn, and Jhon Duran has a clear run at goal. He tries a low shot from 25 yards out, and Stefan Ortega makes a good save to tip it behind. The Villa striker could have taken the ball closer to goal, there. Here we go! 5 mins before kickoff: Villa Park's traditional pyrotechnics are ongoing as the teams begin to make their way onto the pitch. 35 mins before kickoff: Guardiola told TNT Sports in the UK that Ederson \"is not here, he doesn't feel good\". He was happy to welcome back Stones and Akanji, though, despite a relative lack of preparation. \"They trained two or three times,\" he said. \"Of course, they are important players.\" Arrived at Villa Park! 👊#ManCity | #AsahiSuperDry pic.twitter.com/CMFNIXNKLr 1 hour before kickoff: Interesting team news for today: Jack Grealish starts against his old club, with Kevin De Bruyne on the bench. City are also able to welcome back Manuel Akanji to the defence, which actually looks solid on paper this time, although Ederson is not in the squad at all. Villa look to be going 4-3-3, with Amadou Onana starting in an imposing-looking midfield. Jhon Duran leads the attack. 1 hour 30 mins before kickoff: Guardiola is hoping for at least one return from injury today in the form of Manuel Akanji, but the news of Ruben Dias’ weeks-long layoff was another blow in what is proving a hugely difficult season for the reigning champions. 2 hours before kickoff: City and Villa get us underway for this latest Premier League weekend — the first of the busy holiday season. Pep Guardiola may be used to the packed December schedule by now, but he is certainly not accustomed to reaching this point of the season with his team in such disarray: they have lost five of their most recent seven Premier League games, as many as they had in their previous 67 matches combined. Manchester City were leading 1-0 at 87:10, but less than two minutes later (89:06) Manchester United lead 2-1 in the derby.Astonishing. pic.twitter.com/hTIBQ0b1Dx This Premier League match kicks off in Birmingham, UK at 12:30 p.m. local time. Here's how that time translates across some of the major territories: Villa look to be going with a 4-3-3 set-up, with Amadou Onana coming into midfield to partner Boubacar Kamara and Youri Tielemans. Matty Cash reverts to right-back, the Poland international having played on the wing during the defeat to Forest. Emery does not expect Jacob Ramsey to be back from a muscle issue until early January, but Leon Bailey is back on the bench after recovering from a \"small\" thigh injury. Tyrone Mings has sat out Villa's past three games in all competitions but is fit enough to make the matchday squad, having overcome an illness. Aston Villa starting lineup (4-3-3, right to left): Martinez (GK) — Cash, Konsa, Torres, Digne — Tielemans, Kamara, Onana — McGinn, Duran, Rogers Aston Villa subs: Mings, Barkley, Buendia, Watkins, Nedeljkovic, Maatsen, Olsen, Bogarde, Bailey MORE: All the latest EPL club news | Team-by-team Premier League schedule for 2024/25 | Latest Premier League top scorer rankings News that Ruben Dias is facing four weeks on the sidelines represents another body blow to Guardiola, although Manuel Akanji and John Stones returning to the lineup means City's defence looks much more robust than it has recently. Rico Lewis is available after a one-match suspension and comes straight back into the lineup in place of the under-fire Kyle Walker at right-back. Jack Grealish starts against his former club, with Phil Foden the No. 10 in place of the benched Kevin De Bruyne. Goalkeeper Ederson \"does not feel good\", according to Guardiola, and is not in the matchdays squad. Erling Haaland has scored just three times in 11 league matches, but despite speculation of a falling out with Guardiola, he leads the line. Man City starting lineup (4-2-3-1, right to left): Ortega (GK) — Lewis, Stones, Akanji, Gvardiol — Gundogan, Kovacic — Silva, Foden, Grealish — Haaland Man City subs: Walker, Ake, Doku, De Bruyne, Savinho, Carson, Simpson-Pusey, O'Reilly, McAtee Here's how to watch this Premier League match across selected areas of the world's major regions: If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.

                "content": "Paul Edward Goldschmidt (born September 10, 1987), nicknamed \"Goldy\", is an American professional baseball first baseman who is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Arizona Diamondbacks and St. Louis Cardinals. He has also represented the United States in international competition. Lightly recruited out of The Woodlands High School in The Woodlands, Texas, Goldschmidt played for the Texas State Bobcats, and was selected by the Diamondbacks in the eighth round of the 2009 MLB draft. He made his MLB debut with them in 2011, and they traded him to the Cardinals during the 2018–19 offseason. A seven-time MLB All-Star, Goldschmidt won the National League (NL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award in 2022. He has also won two Hank Aaron Awards, four Gold Gloves, and five Silver Slugger Awards, the latter of which is the most among first baseman. While leading the NL in home runs and runs batted in (RBI) in 2013, Goldschmidt won each of an All-Star selection, Hank Aaron, Gold Glove, and Silver Slugger Awards for the first time. He also has twice finished runner-up for the NL MVP Award, in 2013 and 2015. Paul Goldschmidt was born in Wilmington, Delaware, on September 10, 1987,[1] and grew up a Houston Astros fan.[2] His parents, David and Kim, met at the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York.[1] His mother is Catholic and his father is Jewish.[1] Goldschmidt and his two younger brothers were raised Catholic.[1] His Jewish great-grandparents, Paul and Ilse Goldschmidt, and his grandfather, Ernie (who now lives in Fort Lauderdale, Florida), escaped Nazi Germany in 1938 before the Holocaust.[1] Goldschmidt said he and his two brothers \"know our Jewish history and we respect those beliefs. We had both sides of it as kids. My dad's side, my mom's side. We were exposed to all of it.\"[1] The Goldschmidt family moved from Wilmington to Dallas, and then to Houston, because of the flooring company his family owns.[1] He grew up in The Woodlands, which is situated within the Greater Houston area, and attended The Woodlands High School and played for their baseball team. With Goldschmidt playing third base, The Woodlands won the Texas state championship in 2006.[3] Goldschmidt enrolled at Texas State University to play college baseball for the Bobcats. He was named the Southland Conference hitter of the year in 2008 and 2009, Southland player of the year in 2009,[4] and was a third-team All-American as a junior in 2009 after hitting .352 with 18 home runs and 88 runs batted in (RBIs) in 57 games played.[5] Goldschmidt set Bobcat career records with 36 home runs and 179 RBIs.[6] The Los Angeles Dodgers selected Goldschmidt in the 49th round of the 2006 MLB draft.[7] The Dodgers knew he was a long shot to sign with them, but selected him nonetheless. Goldschmidt played with the son of one of the Dodgers' scouts.[8] The Arizona Diamondbacks selected Goldschmidt in the eighth round, with the 246th overall selection, of the 2009 MLB draft.[9] He signed with the Diamondbacks, receiving a $95,000 signing bonus.[10] The Diamondbacks assigned Goldschmidt to the Missoula Osprey of the Rookie-level Pioneer League, where he hit .334 and 18 home runs along with 62 RBIs in his first 74 professional games.[11] The 18 home runs were a Missoula franchise record.[12] The following year, playing for the Visalia Rawhide in the Class A-Advanced California League, he hit 35 home runs, the most for all Class A players, and one behind Mike Moustakas and Mark Trumbo for the Joe Bauman Home Run Award.[13] He was selected as an all-star and won the California League Most Valuable Player Award. He was also named the Arizona Diamondbacks Minor League Player of the Year.[14] In 2011, Goldschmidt played for the Mobile Bay Bears of the Class AA Southern League. He had a .306 batting average, 30 home runs, and 94 RBIs in 103 games played through the end of July, leading all minor leaguers in home runs and RBIs, while his 82 walks was third-best.[15] After the season, Goldschmidt was again named the Diamondbacks' player of the year, a Baseball America first-team Minor League All-Star, Class AA all-star first baseman, Southern League all-star first baseman, and the Southern League's Most Valuable Player.[16] The Diamondbacks promoted Goldschmidt to the major leagues on August 1, 2011.[17] The Diamondbacks intended to platoon Goldschmidt with Xavier Nady.[18] Goldschmidt recorded a base hit in his first MLB at-bat on August 1,[15] and hit his first MLB home run the next day off San Francisco Giants pitcher Tim Lincecum.[12] After Nady broke his wrist in mid-August, the Diamondbacks signed Lyle Overbay to replace him. Goldschmidt credited Overbay for his mentorship.[18] Goldschmidt struck out 20 times in his first 44 MLB at-bats.[12] In his rookie season, Goldschmidt batted .250 with eight home runs and 26 RBI in 48 games.[19] The Diamondbacks made the postseason and played against the Milwaukee Brewers in the 2011 National League Division Series (NLDS). In Game 3, Goldschmidt hit a grand slam to extend the team's lead in its first victory of the series. His home run was the third grand slam by a rookie in MLB postseason history.[20] The Diamondbacks lost the series in five games, and Goldschmidt batted .438 with six RBIs and an OBP of .526.[21] Goldschmidt and Overbay made the Diamondbacks' Opening Day roster in 2012.[22] Goldschmidt hit his first career regular-season grand slam on June 1, 2012, off of Chicago Cubs pitcher Carlos Mármol at Wrigley Field.[23] Four days later, Goldschmidt hit another grand slam off St. Louis Cardinals reliever Maikel Cleto.[24] Overbay played sparingly, and was designated for assignment at the end of July.[25] In 2012, Goldschmidt played 145 games and batted .286 with 20 home runs, 82 runs, 82 RBIs, 43 doubles, and 18 stolen bases.[26] Before the 2013 season, the Diamondbacks and Goldschmidt agreed to a $32 million contract covering the 2014 through 2018 seasons with a club option for the 2019 season worth $14.5 million.[27] He would not have been eligible for salary arbitration until the 2014–15 offseason and free agency until the 2017–18 offseason.[28] Goldschmidt was selected to the National League's team in the 2013 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.[29] Goldschmidt doubled with two outs in the ninth inning, one of only three hits for the National League, and the only extra-base hit.[30] On August 13, he hit a game-tying home run against the Baltimore Orioles in the bottom of the ninth inning to send the game into extra innings. Goldschmidt then hit a walk-off home run in the bottom of the eleventh.[31] Goldschmidt hit a third grand slam on August 20, 2013, against J. J. Hoover of the Cincinnati Reds.[32] In 160 games that season, he attained a .302 batting average, 36 home runs, and 125 RBI.[33] Goldschmidt finished second in the voting for the National League's Most Valuable Player Award, behind Pittsburgh Pirates outfielder Andrew McCutchen.[34] He led MLB with four walk-off hits in 2013.[35] Goldschmidt was the starting first baseman for the National League in the 2014 MLB All-Star Game.[36] In 2014, Goldschmidt batted .300 with 19 home runs, 75 runs, and 69 RBIs. While playing against the Pittsburgh Pirates on August 1, Goldschmidt was hit by a pitch from Ernesto Frieri in the 9th inning. The resulting impact broke a bone in his left hand, which prematurely ended his season.[37] On June 10, 2015, Goldschmidt hit his 100th career home run against Brett Anderson of the Los Angeles Dodgers. At the time of his 100th home run, Goldschmidt was sixth on the Diamondbacks' all-time home run list.[38] Later that year, Goldschmidt was again the starting first baseman for the National League in the All-Star Game. Goldschmidt attained a .321 batting average with 33 home runs and 110 RBIs, with a major-league-leading 29 intentional walks, in 2015.[39] He also was 2nd in the league in power-speed number (25.7).[40] He won his second Gold Glove Award and Silver Slugger Award.[41] For the second time in three seasons, Goldschmidt was voted the runner-up for the National League Most Valuable Player Award, this time finishing behind Washington Nationals outfielder Bryce Harper.[42] In 2016, Goldschmidt batted .297 with 24 home runs, 106 runs, and 95 RBIs in 579 at-bats. He also was third in the league in power–speed number (27.4).[43] He was selected to appear in the 2016 MLB All-Star Game, where he went 0-for-3.[44] On August 3, 2017, Goldschmidt hit three home runs in a game for the first time, bolstering the Diamondbacks' 10–8 win over the Chicago Cubs.[45] For the fifth time in his career, Goldschmidt was named to the National League's All-Star Team. On September 13, 2017, in a game against the Colorado Rockies, Goldschmidt recorded his 1,000th career hit. Goldschmidt finished the 2017 season batting .297 with 36 home runs, 117 runs, and 120 RBIs. He tied for the National League lead in power-speed number (24.0).[46] After the season, Goldschmidt was awarded his third Gold Glove Award and Silver Slugger Award. He also finished third in voting for the National League Most Valuable Player Award.[47] In the 2017 National League Wild Card Game, Goldschmidt hit a three-run home run in the first inning that helped the Diamondbacks to win 11–8 over the Rockies.[48] During the 2017 NLDS, Goldschmidt batted only .091. The Diamondbacks lost the series to the Los Angeles Dodgers.[49] Through the first 20 games in May of the 2018 season, Goldschmidt struggled, managing to get only seven hits out of 73 at-bats (.096). At the time, this lowered his batting average for the season to just .198. Goldschmidt improved in the following month, recording a .390 batting average between June 1 and July 3. In June, he won the National League Player of the Month Award for the first time in his career. His efforts earned him a spot on the All-Star Team for a sixth consecutive year.[50] On August 3, 2018, Goldschmidt hit his 200th career home run against Chris Stratton of the San Francisco Giants.[51] Goldschmidt finished the 2018 season batting .290 with 33 home runs, 95 runs, and 83 RBIs.[52] His 1,088 games played, 209 home runs, 710 RBIs, 1,179 hits, 708 runs scored, and 267 doubles are second in Diamondbacks' history, behind Luis Gonzalez.[53] After the season, the Diamondbacks exercised the $14.5 million option on Goldschmidt's contract for the 2019 season.[54] On December 5, 2018, the Diamondbacks traded Goldschmidt to the St. Louis Cardinals in exchange for Luke Weaver, Carson Kelly, Andy Young, and a Competitive Balance Round B pick in the 2019 MLB draft.[52][55] On March 23, 2019, Goldschmidt and the Cardinals agreed to a five-year contract extension worth $130 million, spanning the 2020–24 seasons.[56] The deal became the largest in team history, eclipsing the seven-year, $120 million contract with Matt Holliday signed in 2010.[57] In his second game with the Cardinals against the Milwaukee Brewers, he hit three home runs and became the first player in Major League history to hit three homers in either his first or second game with a new team.[58] On April 20, 2019, in a game against the New York Mets Goldschmidt hit a 465-foot home run off Paul Sewald that would become both his longest career home run and the longest home run hit at Busch Stadium during the Statcast era. On June 21, 2019, in a game against the Los Angeles Angels, Goldschmidt hit a foul ball that ended up flying over the upper deck seating and out of the stadium, the first such occurrence in the current Busch Stadium.[59] On July 26, 2019, in a game against the Houston Astros, Goldschmidt reached a streak of six home runs in six consecutive games for the first time in his career, also tying the Cardinals franchise record previously set by Matt Carpenter and Mark McGwire. Goldschmidt finished his 2019 regular season, and his first season as a Cardinal, slashing .260/.346/.476 with 34 home runs and 97 RBIs over 161 games. On defense, he had the best fielding percentage of all major league first basemen (.996).[60] Following the season, he was nominated for his first ever Gold Glove in a Cardinals uniform.[61] In 2020, Goldschmidt appeared in 58 games batting .304/.417/.466 with six home runs and 21 RBIs in 231 at-bats.[62] On October 28, 2020, he underwent surgery to have a bone spur removed out of his right elbow.[63] On April 13, 2021, against the Washington Nationals, Goldschmidt hit his 250th career home run.[62] Goldschmidt finished the 2021 season with 603 at-bats over 158 games, slashing .294/.365/.514 with 31 home runs and 99 RBIs.[64] He won the Gold Glove Award at first base, being one of five Cardinals (an MLB record) to win the award.[65] On May 23, 2022, Goldschmidt hit a walk-off grand slam in the bottom of the tenth inning versus the Toronto Blue Jays for a 7–3 win. That grand slam extended Goldschmidt's hitting streak to 15 games, during which he hit .438 with 28 hits, 12 doubles, five home runs, and 22 RBI. Since RBI became an official statistic in 1920, no major leaguer had previously achieved all of those totals during any 15-game span.[a][66] For May, Goldschmidt led the major leagues with a 1.288 OPS and 33 RBI, alongside leading the National League with a .404 average. His ten home runs ranked second in the NL. He was named the NL Player of the Month.[67] The hit streak continued for 25 games until June 4 versus the Chicago Cubs, when Goldschmidt was 0-for-2 with two bases on balls. Over the 25 games, he batted .424 (42-for-99)/.482/.869, 24 extra-base hits, and 36 RBI. It was the longest by a Cardinal since Albert Pujols hit 30 straight in 2003, and tied for the third-longest for the Cardinals since 1963.[68] Goldschmidt reached base safely in 46 consecutive games, which ended on June 11, 2022, versus the Cincinnati Reds.[69] In a two-game span versus the Pittsburgh Pirates on June 14–15, 2022, Goldschmidt achieved nine hits in 12 at-bats with four home runs, six runs scored, nine RBI, a double, and no strikeouts. No player had matched or exceeded those totals with zero strikeouts over a two-game span since Ty Cobb on May 5–6, 1925, when the Detroit Tigers visited the St. Louis Browns.[70] On June 21, Goldschmidt claimed his fourth Player of the Week award after having batted .467 (14-for-30), with four home runs, 11 RBI, and a .967 slugging percentage. He tallied at least one base hit in each of the seven games over the week, including four multi-hit games.[71] On July 5, 2022, Goldschmidt scored his 1,000th run in a contest versus Atlanta.[72] On July 16, he hit his 300th career home run in a game against Cincinnati, the 153rd major leaguer to reach the milestone.[73] Goldschmidt was named the starting first baseman for the National League at the MLB All-Star Game, played at Dodger Stadium.[74] In the first inning, he hit his first career home run in an All-Star Game.[75] On July 23, in a game against the Cincinnati Reds, Goldschmidt recorded his 1,000th career run batted in.[76] On July 24, it was announced that Goldschmidt, along with teammate Nolan Arenado, would not be allowed to travel with the Cardinals to Toronto for a scheduled series against the Blue Jays, due to his lack of a COVID-19 vaccination.[77] At the end of the season, Goldschmidt led the National League with a .578 slugging percentage and .981 OPS while ranking second with 115 RBIs, 324 total bases, and a .404 on-base percentage. His .317 batting average and 35 home runs were ranked third and tied fifth respectively in the NL. Goldschmidt was named the 2022 NL Hank Aaron Award winner.[78] Goldschmidt was also awarded his fifth Silver Slugger Award, giving him the all-time record for Silver Sluggers won among first basemen.[79] On November 17, Goldschmidt won his first National League Most Valuable Player Award, garnering 22 of 30 first-place votes.[80] After playing in the 2023 London Series, Goldschmidt became the first player in MLB history to play regular-season games in five different countries, having played in the United States, Australia, Mexico, Canada, and the United Kingdom.[81] On July 26, 2024, Goldschmidt hit his 2,000th career hit against the Washington Nationals by hitting a two-run homer run off Kyle Finnegan in the bottom of the 10th inning.[82] With that hit, Goldschmidt became the 295th player in Major League history to reach 2,000 hits and the 5th active player to achieve that milestone. Goldschmidt was selected to the United States national baseball team for the 2017 World Baseball Classic, splitting time at first base with Eric Hosmer. In 13 at-bats, he slashed .077/.250/.077 with three walks.[83] Team USA would go on to win the tournament. On August 6, 2022, Goldschmidt announced that he would again play for the United States in the 2023 World Baseball Classic.[84] Goldschmidt met his wife, Amy (née Glazier), during his freshman year at Texas State and they married in October 2010.[85][86] The couple have two children, a son and a daughter.[87][88][89] Goldschmidt became an evangelical Protestant as an adult; he has Jewish, Catholic, and German ancestry.[90][91] In September 2013, Goldschmidt graduated from the University of Phoenix with a Bachelor of Science degree in management.[92] Goldschmidt owned a home in Scottsdale, Arizona, selling it in 2020.[93] That same year, he bought a home in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, purchasing it from South African golfer Louis Oosthuizen.[94][95] During his tenure with the Diamondbacks, Goldschmidt set up a charity, called \"Goldy's Fund 4 Kids\".[96] His charity has hosted bowling events, which raises funds for Phoenix Children's Hospital.[97]",

                "content": "ABOUT THE MLBPA PRESS RELEASES HISTORY RESOURCES More... MiLB MLB Players, Inc. PLAYERS TRUST AGENTS More... Paul Goldschmidt has never taken a day in the majors for granted. Now all those days have carried him to 10 years By Jerry Crasnick Paul Goldschmidt is a six-time All-Star with four Silver Slugger Awards, three Gold Gloves and a track record of durability and achievement for the Arizona Diamondbacks and St. Louis Cardinals. Since 2015, he ranks second to Manny Machado for most games played in the big leagues with 952. He also ranks among the game’s top 10 with 183 home runs and 583 RBIs in that span. ​ On July 22, Goldschmidt checked a major item off his list when he reached 10 years of MLB service time. The Cardinals recognized him with a social media post and a message on the Busch Stadium scoreboard, and Goldschmidt’s parents flew in for an off-day celebration. Then he turned off the “pause’’ button and went back to work. ​ “We all know how hard it is just to get to the big leagues,’’ he said. “I guess that's where my mind has been. It still feels like yesterday I was in the minor leagues and I was trying to make it or survive. It’s hard to produce, year after year and for such a long time, so it's pretty special.’’ ​ At age 33, Goldschmidt plays the game with an earnestness and a commitment that transcend age gaps. He’s a role model for young teammates and a favorite of veterans with more of a “throwback’’ mindset. ​ “He’s a pro,’’ said former MLB outfielder Lance Berkman, a friend and fellow Houstonian. “I don’t know if that’s still prevalent, but we used to talk about that among the players, and it was the highest compliment you can receive. Being in the majors makes you a professional, but it doesn’t make you a pro. He’s a professional in every way.’’ Goldschmidt, who joined Mike Trout, Jose Altuve, Salvador Perez and Alex Cobb in the 10-year club in July, recently sat down with the MLBPA to reflect on his road to the milestone. Some of the interview questions and responses have been edited for clarity. \"It's more a credit to the people around me than even me. I had such great mentors and coaches and teammates, everything I learned was from someone else. \" It's easy to forget now, but you were lightly recruited out of high school before going to Texas State, and you were an eighth-round draft pick in 2009. Does that give you a different perspective on your longevity in the game? ​ “I think I was pretty realistic about my expectations. I got drafted and I was going to give baseball a shot, but by no means did I think getting to the big leagues or making a career of it was guaranteed, so I always had a backup plan. I went back to school to finish my college degree. I never took it for granted, and I still don't. Every year, you have to go out there and prove yourself. There are a lot of great players, so you have to keep adapting and trying to find new ways to produce and help your team. ​ “That storyline of me being an eighth-round pick . . . I don’t know if 'crazy' is the right word, but it was a longer shot. But I don't care if you’re the first overall pick: It’s hard to get to the big leagues and have a long career, so I think I'm in the same boat as everyone else. That's what makes being able to produce over a decade so special for so many players, because anything can happen. There are injuries and so many different things, so just being able to do that is a big honor.’’ In 2011, Baseball America wrote, ‘There's no denying Goldschmidt’s legitimate power to all fields.’’ But some scouts thought you might wind up as a platoon player. Did that give you any extra motivation? ​ “I'm very focused on blocking out any distractions, so I never concerned myself too much with what the scouts or other people said. It’s not like they’re coming up to you and telling that to your face. If you buy Baseball America, I guess you can find out what people think about you. Even now I purposely don’t read what's out there about me or our team or really a lot of teams. It just allows me to focus each day and not get distracted. ​ “When you're good, everyone wants to tell you how great you are, and when you're struggling, they tell you you're worse than you really are, so trying to be consistent is a big goal of mine. It's not like I thought, ‘I’m surefire going to get to the big leagues and have a long career.’ My (attitude) was, ‘I'm gonna work as hard as I can and play as hard as I can and see how good I can be.’ If that was Single A ball and I got released, then I’ll know I gave it my all. And if it was a cup of coffee in the big leagues or anywhere else, whenever my career ends, I want to look back and not have any regrets.’’ A lot of 10-year players look back and recall an injury or a low point when they found out what they were made of. Does anything spring to mind for you? ​ “Not being a high pick, there is more failure built in at the amateur level. Even though I had success, you’re playing with guys who get drafted higher than you or go to bigger colleges or have more success. As I got into pro ball, I think that really helped prepare me. Probably the biggest thing I learned in the minor leagues was how to deal with failure, because you just can't perform like you did at the college and high school level. ​ “If there was one time (in the big leagues) it was probably my last year in Arizona in 2018. I got off to a really bad start, and I was under .200 the first couple months of the season. I kept working and working, but I wasn’t performing, and you’re like, ‘Man, this game is really hard.’ I still had confidence in myself, but you know some things are out of your control. It’s ironic, because I followed up the worst two months of my career with maybe the best two months. It’s funny how the game works out like that.’’ How important has it been to embrace the pressure without letting it overwhelm you? ​ “I think on the outside everyone is like, ‘Oh well, these guys just go out there and perform.’ I remember speaking at Texas State and being asked, ‘When did you know you’ve made it?’ And I was like, ‘I’m scared every year this could be my last year.’ It’s a healthy fear and I think it keeps you motivated to get better, because you know how hard it is.’ There’s always this adjustment. If you do the same thing every year, it’s impossible to have sustained success or keep getting better. Every year is a little different.’’ You mentioned going back for your degree in management. Can you reflect on that period, and your thought process? ​ “It was all online, which is why I chose to go back to the University of Phoenix. I was on all the planes with my laptop and my iPad doing homework and reading and writing papers. For most of 2012 and ‘13 on almost all the road trips, there was a lot less hanging out with the guys because I had to get that done. But I'm very proud that I did that. It was something I really wanted. ​ “I had three years of college and I took my studies seriously and I didn't want those three years to go to waste. I wanted to finish up and not be denied any opportunity outside of baseball, whether my career was a short one or a long one. I wanted to set the example for my future kids. It was something that was important for me and I'm very glad that I did.’’ When Rhys Hoskins was breaking in with the Phillies, he was a bit awestruck over meeting Paul Goldschmidt. Was there a veteran who elicited a similar response in you as a young player? ​ “When I first got called up, I had been watching every guy in the big leagues on TV, so they're all guys you look up to. In order to perform, I had to trick myself that they weren't these guys I was watching on TV. I remember doing that a lot -- pretending they were someone else. ​ “There was maybe only one time I was nervous. One of my favorite players growing up was Lance Berkman. He got to first base when he was with the Rangers, and I was like, ‘Wow, this is a really cool moment.’ I grew up in Houston and he was with the Astros for such a long time and I watched him almost on a daily basis. I took that moment in and I was like, ‘This is really special.’ I never thought this would happen -- and he even knew who I was. He knew I was from Houston, so it turned out to be really cool. We’ve become friends since he retired, with him playing for the Cardinals and just having mutual friends around the game. ​ “I remember when I made the All-Star team in 2013, Joey Votto was starting and he was one of the best first basemen in the game and he said, ‘Do you want to take groundballs?’ I’ll talk to guys at first base. If a guy comes over there and I like the way he hits, I'll try to ask him some questions and try to keep getting better.’’ So you’re a guy who’ll engage in conversation at first base? ​ “It depends where the game is. If it’s a tie game in the bottom of the ninth, you're not over there chit-chatting. It’s not like I’m striking up a conversation with everyone who gets over there. But you build a relationship with some guys. Maybe it’s guys in your division that you see all the time, or you know from the World Baseball Classic or the All-Star Game. Even if there are guys you’re together with in the locker room for one or two days at the All-Star Game, there’s a connection.\" Now that you’ve reached 10 years, do you think about people who influenced you along the way? ​ “I'm really glad you asked that. It's more a credit to the people around me than even me. I had such great mentors and coaches and teammates, everything I learned was from someone else. It starts out even before that. I just think about my parents, my dad, and the lessons they taught me. ​ “Turner Ward was a huge mentor to me. He was my manager in Double-A and then eventually one of our hitting coaches in Arizona, Alan Zinter was a hitting coach I had in the minor leagues. When I got called up, Kirk Gibson was our manager and Don Baylor was our hitting coach. Matt Williams was there. These guys had really long and successful careers. We had a lot of veteran players on the team that took me under their wing. Lyle Overbay was another first baseman, and he was great to me even though we were kind of competing in a sense. I had my locker between Willie Bloomquist and JJ Putz. Geoff Blum and John McDonald were there, and Aaron Hill and I would work out together every day in the offseason at 6 a.m. So he helped mentor me in the offseason. “When I got called up, there were six or eight guys who all had 10 years. That doesn't happen as much anymore. Those guys showed me how to be a big leaguer, and they made the learning curve so much quicker than I could ever imagine. I think that's the great thing about experience. If you use it the right way, even though it doesn't show up in a stat line, you're helping the team or helping other players perform -- which helps a team. A huge amount of any credit that I get goes to those guys I mentioned -- and many, many more.’’ Now that you’ve ascended to that mentor role, what lessons do you try to convey to younger teammates? ​ “It's so easy to get caught up in the moment, which is good: We have to be present. But if you want to have longevity, you need to have a little longer view of things. Sometimes it means not taking as many swings or groundballs because there are 162 games. You want to save your body, but it's hard in the moment. ​ “I think a big thing is dealing with failure. This game is really hard. There are a lot of ups and downs, and everyone's gonna go through it. I don't care who you are. I try to share tips that were taught to me and help speed up that learning curve. There were things that would have taken me five or six years to learn, and (the veterans) told me in my first or second year and made me a better player. ​ “I remember making an error or striking out and guys saying, ‘Hey, it’s all right. You'll get it tomorrow.’ In your rookie year, you can really get down on yourself and you're not sure what tomorrow's gonna look like, or if the guys in the locker room are disappointed with you. Those little sayings or encouraging (words) were the biggest things for me. So I want to be encouraging to all the guys in our locker room to the best of my ability.’’ You're going to be around a while, but have you given any thought to what you want to do when your playing career is over? ​ “I'm not really sure. I definitely have some thoughts in the back of my mind on ways to give back and help out. We’re going to do a baseball camp this year for a bunch of kids in St. Louis and talk about baseball as a way to develop life skills. I was in their shoes when I was 10-12 years old, so that's an idea I'm kind of working on right now. “Sports are just a metaphor for life. There are so many great things about sports. Baseball is my favorite, but with any sport, you’re dealing with failure. Teammates. The humility of dealing with success. How to work with others. Hard work. Sports really bring out all these life skills we value so much. For me, the idea of exploring and spreading that idea is something I'd like to work on over the next few years and kind of see where that takes me when i'm done playing.’’ © 2024 Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA).

                "title": "Paul Goldschmidt to sign with Yankees: Former MVP lands in New York on one-year deal worth $12.5 million - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Decorated veteran slugger and former MVP Paul Goldschmidt has agreed to terms with the New York Yankees on a one-year pact worth $12.5 million, Jim Bowden of CBS Sports HQ reported Saturday. This past season with the St. Louis Cardinals, Goldschmidt showed signs of decline at the plate. In 154 games for the Cardinals, Goldschmidt batted .245/.302/.414 (98 OPS+) with 22 home runs. On the upside, Goldschmidt was productive in 2022 and in 2023 claimed his first and only MVP award as a member of the Cardinals. As well, he's still capable of hitting the ball quite hard, and the Yankees are betting on that quality of contact to hold sway over Goldschmidt's age, 37, and increasing strikeout rates. Goldschmidt will slot in at first base for the Yankees, replacing fellow free-agent Anthony Rizzo after his own disappointing 2024 campaign. Earlier in the offseason, CBS Sports ranked Goldschmidt as the No. 43 available free agent in the current class. Here's part of our write-up: It took 14 seasons but, for the first time in Goldschmidt's career, he failed to post an OPS+ of 100 or better. We must admit that the end is nigh. Goldschmidt's strikeout and walk rates both veered in the wrong directions, leaving him more dependent on his slugging. He can still put a charge into the ball, but his power output has slipped over the last two seasons. There's no shame to any of this; it's simply how aging in baseball works. Goldschmidt is 37 years old and has had a phenomenal career, one that has included seven All-Star Game appearances and a Most Valuable Player Award victory. We think he'll play big-league baseball in 2025 if he chooses to; he just won't be as good as he used to be, to say nothing of him being as good as he wants to be. Goldschmidt will enter the 2025 season with a career OPS+ of 139, 362 home runs, and a WAR of 62.8. He'll one day be a candidate to be elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, but for now Goldschmidt's focus will be on authoring a comeback season in 2025. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

                "content": "Futbol Club Barcelona (Catalan pronunciation: [fubˈbɔl ˈklub bəɾsəˈlonə] ⓘ), commonly known as FC Barcelona and colloquially as Barça ([ˈbaɾsə]), is a professional football club based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, that competes in La Liga, the top flight of Spanish football. Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Catalan, German, and English footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto \"Més que un club\" (\"More than a club\").[2] Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the third-most valuable football club in the world, worth $5.6 billion, and the world's fourth richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €800.1 million.[3][4] The official Barcelona anthem is the \"Cant del Barça\", written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs.[5] Barcelona traditionally play in dark shades of blue and garnet stripes, hence nicknamed Blaugrana. Barcelona are one of the the world's most decorated clubs. Domestically, Barcelona has won a record 77 trophies: 27 La Liga, 31 Copa del Rey, 14 Supercopa de España, three Copa Eva Duarte, and two Copa de la Liga titles, as well as being the record holder for the latter four competitions. In international club football, the club has won 22 European and worldwide titles: five UEFA Champions League titles, a record four UEFA Cup Winners' Cups, five UEFA Super Cups, a record three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, a joint record two Latin Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cups.[6][7][8] Barcelona was ranked first in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 1997, 2009, 2011, 2012, and 2015, and occupies the ninth position on the UEFA club rankings as of May 2023[update].[9][10][11] The club has a long-standing rivalry with Real Madrid, and matches between the two teams are referred to as El Clásico. Barcelona is one of the most widely supported teams in the world, and the club has one of the largest social media following in the world among sports teams.[12][13] Barcelona players have won a joint record twelve Ballon d'Or awards, with recipients including Johan Cruyff, as well as a record six FIFA World Player of the Year awards, with winners including Romário, Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Ronaldinho and Lionel Messi. In 2010, three players who came through the club's youth academy—Lionel Messi, Andrés Iniesta and Xavi—were chosen as the three best players in the world in the Ballon d'Or ranking, an unprecedented feat for players from the same football academy.[14][15] Additionally, players representing the club have won a record eight European Golden Shoe awards.[16] Barcelona is one of three founding members of the Primera División that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929, along with Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid.[17][18] In 2009, Barcelona became the first Spanish club to win the continental treble consisting of La Liga, Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League, and also became the first European football club to win six out of six competitions in a single year, by also winning the Spanish Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup.[19] In 2011, the club became European champions again, winning five trophies.[20] This Barcelona team, which won fourteen trophies in just four years under Pep Guardiola, is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time.[21][22][23] By winning their fifth Champions League trophy in 2015 under Luis Enrique, Barcelona became the first European football club in history to achieve the continental treble twice.[24] On 22 October 1899, Swiss Hans Gamper placed an advertisement in Los Deportes declaring his wish to form a football club; a positive response resulted in a meeting at the Gimnasio Solé on 29 November. Eleven players attended – Walter Wild (the first president of the club), Luis de Ossó, Bartomeu Terradas, Otto Kunzle, Otto Maier, Enric Ducal, Pere Cabot, Carles Pujol, Josep Llobet, John Parsons, and William Parsons – and Foot-Ball Club Barcelona was born.[26][27] FC Barcelona had a successful start in regional and national cups, competing in the Campionat de Catalunya and the Copa del Rey. In 1901, the club participated in the first football competition played on the Iberian Peninsula, the Copa Macaya, narrowly losing to Hispania AC, but in the following year, Barça won the tournament, the club's first-ever piece of silverware,[28] and then participated in the first Copa del Rey, losing 1–2 to Bizcaya (a combination of players from Athletic Club and Bilbao FC) in the final.[29] In 1908, Hans Gamper – now known as Joan Gamper – became club president in a desperate attempt to save Barcelona from extinction, finding the club struggling not just on the pitch, but also financially and socially, after not winning a competition since the Campionat de Catalunya in 1905. He said in a meeting, \"Barcelona cannot die and must not die. If there is nobody who is going to try, then I will assume the responsibility of running the club from now on.\"[30] Club president on five separate occasions between 1908 and 1925, he spent 25 years in total at the helm. One of his main achievements was ensuring Barça acquire its own stadium and thus generate a stable income.[31] On 14 March 1909, the team moved into the Camp de la Indústria, a stadium with a capacity of 8,000. To celebrate their new surroundings, the club conducted a logo contest the following year. Carles Comamala won the contest, and his suggestion became the crest that the club still wears – with some minor changes – as of the present day.[32] The stadium is regarded as the main element that helped the club grow in the 1910s and become a dominant team,[33] winning three successive Campionats de Catalunya between 1909 and 1911, three Copa del del Rey in four years between 1910 and 1913, and four successive Pyrenees Cup between the inaugural year in 1910 and 1913, which was one of the earliest international club cups in Europe since it consisted of the best teams of Languedoc, Midi and Aquitaine (Southern France), the Basque Country and Catalonia; all were former members of the Marca Hispanica region. The contest was the most prestigious in that era.[34] Notable figures of Barça's first great team include Carles Comamala, Alfredo Massana, Amechazurra, Paco Bru, and Jack Greenwell.[35] The latter became the club's first full-time coach in 1917.[36] During the same period, the club changed its official language from Castilian to Catalan and gradually evolved into an important symbol of Catalan identity. For many fans, participating in the club had less to do with the game itself and more with being a part of the club's collective identity.[37] On 4 February 1917, the club held its first tribute match to honour Ramón Torralba, who played from 1913 to 1928. The match was against local side Terrassa where Barcelona won the match 6–2.[38] Gamper simultaneously launched a campaign to recruit more club members, and by 1922, the club had more than 20,000, who helped finance a new stadium. The club then moved to the new Les Cortes, which they inaugurated the same year.[39] Les Cortes had an initial capacity of 30,000, and in the 1940s it was expanded to 60,000.[40] In 1912, Gamper recruited Paulino Alcántara, the club's seventh all-time top-scorer, and in 1917, Gamper also recruited Jack Greenwell as the first full-time manager in Barcelona's history. After this hiring, the club's fortunes began to improve on the field and soon enjoyed its first \"golden age\". Along with Alcántara, the Barça team under Greenwell also included Sagibarba, Ricardo Zamora, Josep Samitier, Félix Sesúmaga, and Franz Platko.[41] This team won 9 out of 10 Campionats de Catalunya between 1919 and 1928 and two Copa del Rey titles in 1920 and 1922. In total, during the Gamper-led era, Barcelona won eleven Campionats de Catalunya, six Copa del Rey and four Pyrenees Cups.[42][31] On 14 June 1925, in a spontaneous reaction against Primo de Rivera's dictatorship, the crowd in the stadium jeered the Royal March. As a reprisal, the ground was closed for six months and Gamper was forced to relinquish the presidency of the club.[43] This coincided with the transition to professional football, and, in 1926, the directors of Barcelona publicly claimed, for the first time, to operate a professional football club.[39] On 3 July 1927, the club held a second testimonial match for Paulino Alcántara, against the Spanish national team. To kick off the match, local journalist and pilot Josep Canudas dropped the ball onto the pitch from his aeroplane.[44] In 1928, victory in the Spanish Cup was celebrated with a poem titled \"Oda a Platko\", which was written by a member of the Generation of '27, Rafael Alberti, inspired by the heroic performance of the Barcelona goalkeeper, Franz Platko.[45] On 23 June 1929, Barcelona won the inaugural Spanish League. A year after winning the championship, on 30 July 1930, Gamper committed suicide after a period of depression brought on by personal and financial problems.[31] Although they continued to have players of the standing of Josep Escolà, the club now entered a period of decline, in which political conflict overshadowed sports throughout society. Attendance at matches dropped as the citizens of Barcelona were occupied with discussing political matters.[46] Although the team won the Campionat de Catalunya in 1930, 1931, 1932, 1934, 1936, and 1938,[42] success at a national level (with the exception of the 1937 disputed title) evaded them. A month after the entire Spanish Civil War began in 1936, several players from Barcelona enlisted in the ranks of those who fought against the military uprising, along with players from Athletic Bilbao.[47] On 6 August, Falangist soldiers near Guadarrama murdered club president Josep Sunyol, a representative of the pro-independence political party.[48] He was dubbed the martyr of barcelonisme, and his murder was a defining moment in the history of FC Barcelona and Catalan identity.[49] In the summer of 1937, the squad was on tour in Mexico and the United States, where it was received as an ambassador of the Second Spanish Republic. The tour led to the financial security of the club but also resulted in half of the team seeking asylum in Mexico and France, making it harder for the remaining team to contest for trophies.[50][51] On 16 March 1938, Barcelona came under aerial bombardment from the Italian Air Force, causing more than 3,000 deaths, with one of the bombs hitting the club's offices.[52][53] A few months later, Catalonia came under occupation and as a symbol of the \"undisciplined\" Catalanism, the club, now down to just 3,486 members, faced a number of restrictions. All signs of regional nationalism, including language, flag and other signs of separatism were banned throughout Spain. The Catalan flag was banned and the club were prohibited from using non-Spanish names. These measures forced the club to change its name to Club de Fútbol Barcelona and to remove the Catalan flag from its crest.[54] In 1943, Barcelona faced rivals Real Madrid in the semi-finals of Copa del Generalísimo (now the Copa del Rey). The first match at Les Corts was won by Barcelona 3–0. Real Madrid comfortably won the second leg, beating Barcelona 11–1.[55] According to football writer Sid Lowe, \"There have been relatively few mentions of the game [since] and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid. Indeed, the 11–1 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelona's history. This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims.\"[56] It has been alleged by local journalist Paco Aguilar that Barcelona's players were threatened by police in the changing room, though nothing was ever proven.[57] Despite the difficult political situation, CF Barcelona enjoyed considerable success during the 1940s and 1950s. In 1945, with Josep Samitier as coach and players like César, Ramallets and Velasco, they won La Liga for the first time since 1929. They added two more titles in 1948 and 1949.[58] In 1949, they also won the first Copa Latina.[59] In June 1950, Barcelona signed László Kubala, who was to be an important figure at the club.[60] On a rainy Sunday of 1951, the crowd left Les Corts stadium after a 2–1 win against Santander by foot, refusing to catch any trams, and surprising the Francoist authorities. The reason was simple: at the same time, a tram strike was taking place in Barcelona, receiving the support of blaugrana fans. Events like this made CF Barcelona represent much more than just Catalonia and many progressive Spaniards saw the club as a staunch defender of rights and freedoms.[61][62] Coach Ferdinand Daučík and László Kubala led the team to five different trophies including La Liga, the Copa del Generalísimo, the Copa Latina, the Copa Eva Duarte, and the Copa Martini & Rossi in 1952. In 1953, the club won La Liga and the Copa del Generalísimo again.[40] With Helenio Herrera as coach, a young Luis Suárez, the European Footballer of the Year in 1960, and two influential Hungarians recommended by Kubala, Sándor Kocsis and Zoltán Czibor, the team won another national double in 1959 and a La Liga and Fairs Cup double in 1960. In 1961, they became the first club to beat Real Madrid in a European Cup play-off. However, they lost 2–3 to Benfica in the final.[63][64] The 1960s were less successful for the club, with Real Madrid monopolising La Liga. The completion of Camp Nou, finished in 1957, meant the club had little money to spend on new players.[64] The 1960s saw the emergence of Josep Maria Fusté and Carles Rexach, and the club won the Copa del Generalísimo in 1963 and the Fairs Cup in 1966. Barcelona restored some pride by beating Real Madrid 1–0 in the 1968 Copa del Generalísimo final at the Santiago Bernabéu in front of dictator Francisco Franco, with coach Salvador Artigas, a former republican pilot in the Civil War. With the end of Franco's dictatorship in 1974, the club changed its official name back to Futbol Club Barcelona and reverted the crest to its original design, including the original letters once again.[65][66] The 1973–74 season saw the arrival of Johan Cruyff, who was bought for a world record £920,000 from Ajax.[67] Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Francisco Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son \"Jordi\", after the local Catalan Saint George.[68] Next to champions like Juan Manuel Asensi, Carles Rexach and Hugo Sotil, he helped the club win the 1973–74 season for the first time since 1960,[42] defeating Real Madrid 5–0 at the Santiago Bernabéu en route. He was crowned European Footballer of the Year in 1973 during his first season with Barcelona (his second Ballon d'Or win; he won his first while playing for Ajax in 1971). Cruyff received this prestigious award a third time (the first player to do so) in 1974, while he was still with Barcelona.[69] In 1978, Josep Lluís Núñez became the first elected president of FC Barcelona, and, since then, the members of Barcelona have elected the club president. The process of electing a president of FC Barcelona was closely tied to Spain's transition to democracy in 1974 and the end of Franco's dictatorship. The new president's main objective was to develop Barcelona into a world-class club by giving it stability both on and off the pitch. His presidency was to last for 22 years, and it deeply affected the image of Barcelona, as Núñez held to a strict policy regarding wages and discipline, letting go of such players as Diego Maradona, Romário and Ronaldo rather than meeting their demands.[72][73] On 16 May 1979, the club won its first European Cup Winners' Cup by beating Fortuna Düsseldorf 4–3 in Basel in a final watched by more than 30,000 travelling blaugrana fans. The same year, Núñez began to invest in the club's youth programme by converting La Masia into a dormitory for young academy players from abroad. The name of the dormitory would later become synonymous with the youth programme of Barcelona.[74] In June 1982, Diego Maradona was signed for a world record fee of £5 million from Boca Juniors.[75] In the following season, under coach César Luis Menotti, Barcelona won the Copa del Rey, beating Real Madrid. Maradona's time with Barcelona, however, was short-lived and he soon left for Napoli. At the start of the 1984–85 season, Terry Venables was hired as manager and he won La Liga with noteworthy displays by German midfielder Bernd Schuster. The next season, he took the team to their second European Cup final, only to lose on penalties to Steaua București during a dramatic evening in Seville.[72] Around this time, tensions began to arise between what was perceived as president Núñez's dictatorial rule and the nationalistic support group, Boixos Nois. The group, identified with a left-wing separatism, repeatedly demanded the resignation of Núñez and openly defied him through chants and banners at matches. At the same time, Barcelona experienced an eruption in skinheads, who often identified with a right-wing separatism. The skinheads slowly transferred the Boixos Nois' ideology from liberalism to fascism, which caused division within the group and a sudden support for Núñez's presidency.[76] Inspired by British hooligans, the remaining Boixos Nois became violent, causing havoc leading to large-scale arrests.[77] After the 1986 FIFA World Cup, Barcelona signed the English top scorer Gary Lineker, along with goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, but the team could not achieve success, as Schuster was excluded from the team. Terry Venables was subsequently fired at the beginning of the 1987–88 season and replaced with Luis Aragonés. The season finished with the players rebelling against president Núñez, in an event known as the Hesperia mutiny, and a 1–0 victory in the Copa del Rey final against Real Sociedad.[72] In 1988, Johan Cruyff returned to the club, this time as manager and he assembled what would later be dubbed the \"Dream Team\".[78] He used a mix of Spanish players like Pep Guardiola, José Mari Bakero, Jon Andoni Goikoetxea, Miguel Angel Nadal, and Txiki Begiristain while signing international players such as Ronald Koeman, Michael Laudrup, Romário, and Hristo Stoichkov.[79] It was ten years after the inception of the youth programme, La Masia, when the young players began to graduate and play for their first team. Pep Guardiola, the future coach of Barcelona, was one of the first graduates and would go on to receive international recognition.[80] Under Cruyff's guidance, Barcelona won four consecutive La Liga titles from 1991 to 1994. They beat Sampdoria in both the 1989 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup final and the 1992 European Cup final at Wembley, with a free kick goal from Dutch international Ronald Koeman. They also won a Copa del Rey in 1990, the European Super Cup in 1992 and three Supercopa de España trophies.[81] With 11 trophies, Cruyff became the club's most successful manager at that point. He also became the club's longest consecutive serving manager, serving eight years.[82] Cruyff's fortune was to change, and, in his final two seasons, he failed to win any trophies and fell out with president Josep Lluís Núñez, resulting in his departure.[72] Reacting to Cruyff's departure, an independent protest group was organised by Armand Caraben, Joan Laporta and Alfons Godall.[83] The objective of the group, called L'Elefant Blau, was to oppose the presidency of Núñez, which they regarded as a corruption of the club's traditional values.[83][84] Laporta would later take over the presidency of Barcelona in 2003.[85] Cruyff was briefly replaced by Bobby Robson, who took charge of the club for a single season in 1996–97. He recruited Ronaldo for a world record transfer fee from his previous club, PSV and delivered a cup treble, winning the Copa del Rey, UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the Supercopa de España, with Ronaldo registering 47 goals in 49 games.[86] Despite his success, Robson was only ever seen as a short-term solution while the club waited for Louis van Gaal to become available.[87] Like Maradona, Ronaldo only stayed a short time before he left for Inter Milan in another world record transfer.[86] However, new heroes emerged, such as Luís Figo, Patrick Kluivert, Luis Enrique and Rivaldo, and the team won a Copa del Rey and La Liga double in 1998. In 1999, the club celebrated its centenari, winning the Primera División title, and Rivaldo became the fourth Barcelona player to be awarded European Footballer of the Year. Despite this domestic success, the failure to emulate Real Madrid in the Champions League led to van Gaal and Núñez resigning in 2000.[87] The departures of Núñez and Van Gaal were hardly noticed by the fans when compared to that of Luís Figo, then club vice-captain. Figo had become a cult hero and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. Barcelona fans, however, were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to Camp Nou, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd.[90] The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went. Van Gaal was replaced by Lorenzo Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a first-round Champions League exit, and was dismissed late in the season. Long-serving Barcelona deputy coach Carles Rexach was appointed as his replacement, initially on a temporary basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot on the final day of the season against Valencia via an exceptional performance from Rivaldo, who completed arguably the greatest hat-trick in history with an overhead bicycle kick winner in the final minute to secure qualification.[91][92][93] Despite better form in La Liga and a good run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Rexach was never viewed as a long-term solution and that summer Van Gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager. What followed, despite another decent Champions League performance, was one of the worst La Liga campaigns in the club's history, with the team as low as 15th in February 2003. This led to Van Gaal's resignation and replacement for the rest of the campaign by Radomir Antić, though a sixth-place finish was the best that he could manage. At the end of the season, Antić's short-term contract was not renewed, and club president Joan Gaspart resigned, his position having been made completely untenable by such a disastrous season on top of the club's overall decline in fortunes since he became president three years prior.[94] After the disappointment of the Gaspart era, the combination of a new young president, Joan Laporta, and a young new manager, former Dutch and AC Milan star Frank Rijkaard, saw the club bounce back. On the field, an influx of international players, including Ronaldinho, Deco, Henrik Larsson, Ludovic Giuly, Samuel Eto'o, Rafael Márquez and Edgar Davids, combined with home grown Spanish players, such as Carles Puyol, Andrés Iniesta, Xavi and Víctor Valdés, led to the club's return to success. Barcelona won La Liga and the Supercopa de España in 2004–05, and Ronaldinho and Eto'o were voted first and third, respectively, in the FIFA World Player of the Year awards.[95] In the 2005–06 season, Barcelona repeated their league and Supercopa successes. The pinnacle of the league season arrived at the Santiago Bernabéu in a 3–0 win over Real Madrid. It was Rijkaard's second victory at the Bernabéu, making him the first Barcelona manager to win there twice. Ronaldinho's performance was so impressive that after his second goal, which was Barcelona's third, some Real Madrid fans gave him a standing ovation.[96] In the Champions League, Barcelona beat English club Arsenal in the final. Trailing 1–0 to a ten-man Arsenal and with less than 15 minutes remaining, they came back to win 2–1, with substitute Henrik Larsson, in his final appearance for the club, setting up goals for Samuel Eto'o and fellow substitute Juliano Belletti, for the club's first European Cup victory in 14 years.[97] Despite being the favourites and starting strongly, Barcelona finished the 2006–07 season without trophies. A pre-season US tour was later blamed for a string of injuries to key players, including leading scorer Eto'o and rising star Lionel Messi. There was open feuding as Eto'o publicly criticised coach Rijkaard and Ronaldinho.[98] Ronaldinho also admitted that a lack of fitness affected his form.[99] In La Liga, Barcelona were in first place for much of the season, but inconsistency in the New Year saw Real Madrid overtake them to become champions. Barcelona advanced to the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey, winning the first leg against Getafe 5–2, with a goal from Messi bringing comparison to Diego Maradona's goal of the century, but then lost the second leg 4–0. They took part in the 2006 FIFA Club World Cup, but were beaten by a late goal in the final against Brazilian side Internacional.[100] In the Champions League, Barcelona were knocked out of the competition in the last 16 by eventual runners-up Liverpool on away goals.[101] Barcelona finished the 2007–08 season third in La Liga and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League and Copa del Rey, both times losing to the eventual champions, Manchester United and Valencia, respectively. The day after a 4–1 defeat to Real Madrid, Joan Laporta announced that Barcelona B coach Pep Guardiola would take over Frank Rijkaard's duties on 30 June 2008.[102] Barcelona B youth manager Pep Guardiola took over Frank Rijkaard's duties at the conclusion of the season.[102] Guardiola brought with him the now famous tiki-taka style of play he had been taught during his time in the Barcelona youth teams. In the process, Guardiola sold Ronaldinho and Deco and started building the Barcelona team around Xavi, Andrés Iniesta and Lionel Messi.[104] Barça beat Athletic Bilbao 4–1 in the 2009 Copa del Rey final, winning the competition for a record-breaking 25th time.[105] A historic 2–6 victory against Real Madrid followed three days later and ensured that Barcelona became 2008–09 La Liga champions.[106] Barça finished the season by beating Manchester United 2–0 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, with goals from Eto'o and Messi, to win their third Champions League title, and complete the first ever treble won by a Spanish team.[107][108][109] The team went on to win the 2009 Supercopa de España against Athletic Bilbao[110] and the 2009 UEFA Super Cup against Shakhtar Donetsk,[111] becoming the first European club to win both domestic and European Super Cups following a treble. In December 2009, Barcelona won the 2009 Club World Cup.[112] Barcelona accomplished two new records in Spanish football in 2010 as they retained the La Liga trophy with 99 points and won the Supercopa de España for a ninth time.[113][114] After Laporta's departure from the club in June 2010, Sandro Rosell was soon elected as the new president. The elections were held on 13 June, where he received 61.35% (57,088 votes, a record) of total votes.[115] Rosell signed David Villa from Valencia for €40 million[116] and Javier Mascherano from Liverpool for €19 million.[117] At the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, Barcelona players that had graduated from the club's La Masia youth system would play a major role in Spain becoming world champions. On 11 July, seven players who came through the academy participated in the final, six of whom were Barcelona players who started the match, with Iniesta scoring the winning goal against the Netherlands.[118] In November 2010, Barcelona defeated their main rival Real Madrid 5–0 in El Clásico.[119] At the ceremony for the 2010 FIFA Ballon d'Or in December, Barcelona's La Masia became the first youth academy ever to have all three finalists for the Ballon d'Or, with Messi, Iniesta and Xavi being named the three best players in the world for 2010.[120] In the 2010–11 season, Barcelona retained the La Liga trophy, their third title in succession, finishing with 96 points.[121] In April 2011, the club reached the Copa del Rey final, losing 1–0 to Real Madrid at the Mestalla Stadium in Valencia.[122] In May, Barcelona defeated Manchester United in the 2011 Champions League Final 3–1 held at Wembley Stadium, a repeat of the 2009 final, winning their fourth European Cup.[123] In August 2011, La Masia graduate Cesc Fàbregas was bought from Arsenal and he would help Barcelona defend the Spanish Supercup against Real Madrid. The Supercup victory brought the total number of official trophies to 73, matching the number of titles won by Real Madrid.[124] Later the same month, Barcelona won the UEFA Super Cup defeating Porto 2–0 with goals from Messi and Fàbregas. This extended the club's overall number of official trophies to 74, surpassing Real Madrid's total amount of official trophies.[125] The Super Cup victory also saw Guardiola win his 12th trophy out of a possible 15 in his three years at the helm of the club, becoming the all-time record holder of most titles won as a coach at Barcelona.[126] In December, Barcelona won the Club World Cup for a record second time since its establishment, after defeating 2011 Copa Libertadores holders Santos 4–0 in the final thanks to two goals from Messi and goals from Xavi and Fàbregas.[127] As a result, the overall trophy haul during the reign of Guardiola was further extended and saw Barcelona win their 13th trophy out of a possible 16.[128][129] Considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time, with Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson stating, ”They mesmerise you with their passing”,[22] their five trophies in 2011 saw them receive the Laureus World Sports Award for Team of the Year.[130] In the 2011–12 season, Barcelona lost the semi-finals of the Champions League against Chelsea. Guardiola, who had been on a rolling contract and had faced criticism over his recent tactics and squad selections,[131][132] announced that he would step down as manager on 30 June and be succeeded by assistant Tito Vilanova.[133][134] Guardiola finished his tenure with Barça winning the Copa del Rey final 3–0, bringing the tally to 14 trophies that Barça had won under his coaching.[135] It was announced in summer of 2012 that Tito Vilanova, assistant manager at Barcelona, would take over from Pep Guardiola as manager.[136] Following his appointment, Barcelona went on an incredible run that saw them hold the top spot on the league table for the entire season, recording only two losses and amassing 100 points. Their top scorer once again was Lionel Messi, who scored 46 goals in La Liga, including two hat-tricks. On 11 May 2013, Barcelona were crowned as the Spanish football champions for the 22nd time, still with four games left to play. Ultimately, Barcelona ended the season 15 points clear of rivals Real Madrid, despite losing 2–1 to them at the beginning of March.[137] They reached the semi-final stage of both the Copa del Rey and the Champions League, going out to Real Madrid and Bayern Munich respectively. On 19 July, it was announced that Vilanova was resigning as Barcelona manager because his throat cancer had returned, and he would be receiving treatment for the second time after a three-month medical leave in December 2012.[138] On 22 July 2013, Gerardo \"Tata\" Martino was confirmed as manager of Barcelona for the 2013–14 season.[139] Barcelona won the 2013 Supercopa de España 1–1 on away goals.[140] On 23 January 2014, Sandro Rosell resigned as president by the admissibility of a complaint for alleged misappropriation following the transfer of Neymar.[141] Josep Maria Bartomeu replaced him to finish the term.[142] Barcelona won the treble in the 2014–15 season, winning La Liga, Copa del Rey and Champions League titles, and became the first European team to have won the treble twice.[143] On 17 May, the club clinched their 23rd La Liga title after defeating Atlético Madrid.[144] This was Barcelona's seventh La Liga title in the last ten years.[145] On 30 May, the club defeated Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final at Camp Nou.[146] On 6 June, Barcelona won the 2015 Champions League Final with a 3–1 win against Juventus, which completed the treble, the club's second in six years.[147] Barcelona's attacking trio of Messi, Suárez and Neymar, dubbed \"MSN\", scored 122 goals in all competitions, the most in a season for an attacking trio in Spanish football history.[148] On 11 August, Barcelona started the 2015–16 season winning a joint record fifth European Super Cup by beating Sevilla 5–4 in the 2015 UEFA Super Cup. They ended the year with a 3–0 win over Argentine club River Plate in the 2015 Club World Cup final on 20 December to win the trophy for a record third time, with Suárez, Messi and Iniesta the top three players of the tournament.[149] The Club World Cup was Barcelona's 20th international title, a record only matched by Egyptian club Al Ahly.[150][151] By scoring 180 goals in 2015 in all competitions, Barcelona set the record for most goals scored in a calendar year, breaking Real Madrid's record of 178 goals scored in 2014.[152] On 10 February 2016, qualifying for the sixth Copa del Rey final in the last eight seasons, Luis Enrique's Barcelona broke the club's record of 28 consecutive games unbeaten in all competitions set by Guardiola's team in the 2010–11 season, with a 1–1 draw with Valencia in the second leg of the 2015–16 Copa del Rey.[153][154] With a 5–1 win at Rayo Vallecano on 3 March, Barcelona's 35th match unbeaten, the club broke Real Madrid's Spanish record of 34 games unbeaten in all competitions from the 1988–1989 season.[155][156] After Barça reached 39 matches unbeaten, their run ended on 2 April 2016 with a 2–1 defeat to Real Madrid at Camp Nou.[157] On 14 May 2016, Barcelona won their sixth La Liga title in eight seasons.[158] The front three of Messi, Suárez and Neymar finished the season with 131 goals, breaking the record they had set the previous year for most goals by an attacking trio in a single season.[159] On 8 March 2017, Barcelona made the largest comeback in Champions League history in the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League Round of 16 second Leg, defeating Paris Saint-Germain 6–1 (aggregate score 6–5), despite losing the first leg in France by a score of 4–0.[160] On 29 May 2017, former player Ernesto Valverde was named as Luis Enrique's successor.[161] On 20 September 2017, Barcelona issued a statement exercising their stance on the 2017 Catalan referendum saying, \"FC Barcelona, in holding the utmost respect for its diverse body of members, will continue to support the will of the majority of Catalan people, and will do so in a civil, peaceful, and exemplary way\".[162] The match against UD Las Palmas on the referendum day was requested to be postponed by the Barcelona board due to heavy violence in Catalonia, but it (the request) was declined by La Liga, therefore being held behind closed doors.[163] Two directors, Jordi Monés and Carles Vilarrubí, handed in their resignations in protest at the game's being played.[164] Winning La Liga for the 2017–18 season, on 9 May 2018, Barcelona defeated Villarreal 5–1 to set the longest unbeaten streak (43 games) in La Liga history.[165] On 27 April 2019, Barcelona won their 26th La Liga title.[166] However, the La Liga title was overshadowed by an improbable Champions League exit to Liverpool in the semi-finals, with Barça losing the second leg 0–4 after being up 3–0 after a home victory.[167] On 13 January 2020, following the loss to Atlético Madrid in the Spanish Supercup, former Real Betis coach Quique Setién replaced Ernesto Valverde as the new head coach of Barcelona.[168] Ultimately Barcelona finished the season trophyless for first time in 12 years. On 17 August, the club confirmed that Setién had been removed from his position as manager with director of football Eric Abidal also dismissed from his position.[169] Two days later, Ronald Koeman was appointed as the new head coach of Barcelona.[170] Rising dissatisfaction among supporters due to worsening finances and decline on the pitch in the previous season led to Josep Maria Bartomeu announcing his resignation as president on 27 October 2020, to avoid facing a vote of no confidence from the club members.[171][172] On 7 March 2021, Joan Laporta was elected president of Barcelona with 54.28% of the vote.[173] Barcelona won their 31st Copa del Rey, their only trophy under Ronald Koeman, after defeating Athletic Bilbao 4–0 in the final.[174] In August 2021 Barcelona found themselves unable to comply with La Liga's Financial Fair Play requirements, and revealed a club debt of €1.35bn and a wage bill accounting for 103% of total income. Negotiations with Lionel Messi, now in the final year of his contract, had been ongoing for some time. However, on 5 August 2021, Barcelona announced that they would be unable to re-sign Messi to an extension due to La Liga regulations. This was despite the fact that the club and Messi had reached an agreement over the details of a new contract. Messi departed the club after 21 years as a Barça player, and the club's all-time leading goalscorer, and signed on a free transfer with French club Paris Saint-Germain.[175][176] The financial implications also restricted Barcelona in the transfer market and as a result most of the incoming players were either free transfers or loans and they had to reduce players' wages to register the incoming players.[177] Poor performances in La Liga and the Champions League led to the sacking of Ronald Koeman on 28 October, with a club legend Xavi replacing him.[178][179] Xavi could not reverse the fortunes in the Champions League, and Barcelona dropped down to the Europa League for the first time since 2003–04, subsequently exiting in the quarter-finals.[180] In the domestic league, Xavi improved Barça's form and guided them from ninth to second, guaranteeing a Champions League spot next season. However, this also meant Barcelona finished trophyless after earlier Supercopa and Copa del Rey exits.[181] On 15 January 2023, Xavi guided Barcelona to their first trophy since the 2021 Copa del Rey, as the Catalans defeated Real Madrid 3–1 in the Supercopa de España final.[182] The nickname culer for a Barcelona supporter is derived from the Catalan cul (English: arse), as the spectators at the first stadium, Camp de la Indústria, sat with their culs over the stand.[183][184] In Spain, about 25% of the population is said to be Barça sympathisers, second behind Real Madrid, supported by 32% of the population.[185] Throughout Europe, Barcelona is the favourite second-choice club.[186] The club's membership figures have seen a significant increase from 100,000 in the 2003–04 season to 170,000 in September 2009,[187] the sharp rise being attributed to the influence of Ronaldinho and then-president Joan Laporta's media strategy that focused on Spanish and English online media.[188][189] As of 31 May 2023[update], the club has 150,317 memberships, called socis.[190] In addition to membership, as of March 2022[update] there are 1,264 officially registered fan clubs, called penyes, around the world.[191] The fan clubs promote Barcelona in their locality and receive beneficial offers when visiting Barcelona.[192] Among the best supported teams globally, Barcelona has the second highest social media following in the world among sports teams, with over 103 million Facebook fans as of December 2021[update], only behind Real Madrid with 111 million.[12][193] The club has had many prominent people among its supporters, including Pope John Paul II, who was an honorary member, and former prime minister of Spain José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero.[194][195] There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Barcelona and Real Madrid is known as \"The Classic\" (El Clásico). From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Catalonia and Castile, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between Catalans and the Castilians, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.[196] Over the years, the head-to-head record between the two clubs is 102 victories for Madrid, 100 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws.[197] As early as the 1930s, Barcelona \"had developed a reputation as a symbol of Catalan identity, opposed to the centralising tendencies of Madrid\".[198][199] In 1936, when Francisco Franco started the Coup d'état against the democratic Second Spanish Republic, the president of Barcelona, Josep Sunyol, member of the Republican Left of Catalonia and Deputy to The Cortes, was arrested and executed without trial by Franco's troops[200] (Sunyol was exercising his political activities, visiting Republican troops north of Madrid).[198] During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera and especially Francisco Franco, all regional languages and identities in Spain were frowned upon and restrained. As such, most citizens of Barcelona were in strong opposition to the fascist-like regime. In this period, Barcelona gained their motto Més que un club (English: More than a club) because of its alleged connection to Catalan nationalist as well as to progressive beliefs.[201] There's an ongoing controversy as to what extent Franco's rule (1939–75) influenced the activities and on-pitch results of both Barcelona and Real Madrid. Fans of both clubs tend to exaggerate the myths favouring their narratives. Most historians agree than Franco did not have a preferred football team, but his Spanish nationalist beliefs led him to associate himself with the establishment teams, such as Atlético Aviación and Madrid FC (that recovered its royal name after the fall of the Republic). On the other hand, he also wanted the renamed CF Barcelona succeed as \"Spanish team\" rather than a Catalan one. During the early years of Franco's rule, Real Madrid weren't particularly successful, winning two Copa del Generalísimo titles and a Copa Eva Duarte; Barcelona claimed three league titles, one Copa del Generalísimo and one Copa Eva Duarte. During that period, Atlético Aviación were believed to be the preferred team over Real Madrid. The most contested stories of the period include Real Madrid's 11–1 home win against Barcelona in the Copa del Generalísimo, where the Catalan team alleged intimidation, and the controversial transfer of Alfredo Di Stéfano to Real Madrid despite his agreement with Barcelona. The latter transfer was part of Real Madrid chairman Santiago Bernabéu's \"revolution\" that ushered in the era of unprecedented dominance. Bernabéu, himself a veteran of the Civil War who fought for Franco's forces, saw Real Madrid on top not only of Spanish but also European football, helping create the European Cup, the first true competition for Europe's best club sides. His vision was fulfilled when Real Madrid not only started winning consecutive league titles but also swept the first five editions of the European Cup in the 1950s.[202] These events had a profound impact on Spanish football and influenced Franco's attitude. According to historians, during this time he realized the importance of Real Madrid for his regime's international image, and the club became his preferred team until his death. Fernando Maria Castiella, who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs under Franco from 1957 until 1969, noted that \"[Real Madrid] is the best embassy we have ever had.\" Franco died in 1975, and the Spanish transition to democracy soon followed. Under his rule, Real Madrid had won 14 league titles, 6 Copa del Generalísimo titles, 1 Copa Eva Duarte, 6 European Cups, 2 Latin Cups, and 1 Intercontinental Cup. In the same period, Barcelona had won 8 league titles, 9 Copa del Generalísimo titles, 3 Copa Eva Duarte titles, 3 Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, and 2 Latin Cups.[203][204] The rivalry was intensified during the 1950s when the clubs disputed the signing of Alfredo Di Stéfano. Di Stéfano had impressed both Barcelona and Real Madrid while playing for Los Millionarios in Bogotá, Colombia, during a players' strike in his native Argentina. Soon after Millonarios' return to Colombia, Barcelona directors visited Buenos Aires and agreed with River Plate, the last FIFA-affiliated team to have held Di Stéfano's rights, for his transfer in 1954 for the equivalent of 150 million Italian lira (according to other sources 200,000 dollars). This started a battle between the two Spanish rivals for his rights. FIFA appointed Armando Muñoz Calero, former president of the Spanish Football Federation as mediator. Calero decided to let Di Stéfano play the 1953–54 and 1955–56 seasons in Madrid, and the 1954–55 and 1956–57 seasons in Barcelona. The agreement was approved by the Football Association and their respective clubs. Although the Catalans agreed, the decision created various discontent among the Blaugrana members and the president was forced to resign in September 1953. Barcelona sold Madrid their half-share, and Di Stéfano moved to Los Blancos, signing a four-year contract. Real paid 5.5 million Spanish pesetas for the transfer, plus a 1.3 million bonus for the purchase, an annual fee to be paid to the Millonarios, and a 16,000 salary for Di Stéfano with a bonus double that of his teammates, for a total of 40% of the annual revenue of the Madrid club.[205] Di Stéfano became integral in the subsequent success achieved by Real Madrid, scoring twice in his first game against Barcelona. With him, Madrid won the first five editions of the European Cup.[206] The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when Real Madrid and Barcelona met twice in the European Cup, with Madrid triumphing en route to their fifth consecutive title in 1959–60 and Barcelona prevailing en route to losing the final in 1960–61. In 2002, the European encounter between the clubs was dubbed the \"Match of The Century\" by Spanish media, and Madrid's win was watched by more than 500 million people.[207] An intense fixture which is marked by its indiscipline in addition to memorable goal celebrations from both teams – often involving mocking the opposition – such notable celebrations occurred in 2009 when Barcelona captain Carles Puyol kissed his Catalan armband in front of incensed Madrid fans at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium and in 2017 when Lionel Messi celebrated his 93rd-minute winner for Barcelona against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu by taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans – with his name and number facing them.[208] Barça's local rival has always been Espanyol. Blanc-i-blaus, being one of the clubs granted royal patronage, was founded exclusively by Spanish football fans, unlike the multinational nature of Barça's primary board. The founding message of the club was clearly anti-Barcelona, and they disapprovingly saw FC Barcelona as a team of foreigners.[209] The rivalry was strengthened by what Catalonians saw as a provocative representative of Madrid.[210] Their original ground was in the affluent district of Sarrià.[211][212] Traditionally, Espanyol was seen by the vast majority of Barcelona's citizens as a club which cultivated a kind of compliance to the central authority, in stark contrast to Barça's revolutionary spirit.[213] Also in the 1960s and 1970s, while FC Barcelona acted as an integrating force for Catalonia's new arrivals from poorer regions of Spain expecting to find a better life, Espanyol drew their support mainly from sectors close to the regime such as policemen, military officers, civil servants and career fascists.[214] In 1918, Espanyol started a counter-petition against autonomy, which at that time had become a pertinent issue.[209] Later on, an Espanyol supporter group would join the Falangists in the Spanish Civil War, siding with the fascists. Despite these differences in ideology, the derbi has always been more relevant to Espanyol supporters than Barcelona ones due to the difference in objectives. In recent years the rivalry has become less political, as Espanyol translated its official name and anthem from Spanish to Catalan.[209] Though it is the most played local derby in the history of La Liga, it is also the most unbalanced, with Barcelona overwhelmingly dominant. In the primera división league table, Espanyol has only managed to end above Barça on three occasions from 87 seasons (1928–2022) and the only all-Catalan Copa del Rey final was won by Barça in 1957. Espanyol has the consolation of achieving the largest margin win with a 6–0 in 1951, while Barcelona's biggest win was 5–0 on seven occasions (in 1933, 1947, 1964, 1975, 1992, 2016 and 2017). Espanyol achieved a 2–1 win against Barça during the 2008–09 season, becoming the first team to defeat Barcelona at Camp Nou in their treble-winning season.[215] One of Barcelona's rivals in European football is Italian club AC Milan.[216][217][218][219] The team against which Barcelona has played the most matches (19), it is also the third most played match in European club competitions, behind Real Madrid–Juventus (21) and Real Madrid–Bayern Munich (26).[220][221][222] Two of the most successful clubs in Europe, Milan has won seven European Cups to Barça's five, while both clubs have won a record five European Super Cups.[223] Barcelona and Milan have won other continental titles, which make them the second and third most decorated teams in world football, with 19 and 14 titles respectively, both behind Real Madrid's 23.[224] Barcelona leads the head-to-head record with eight wins and five defeats. The first encounter between the two clubs was in the 1959–60 European Cup. They faced off in the round of 16 and Barça won the tie on a 7–1 aggregate score (0–2 in Milan and 5–1 in Barcelona).[225] While Milan had never knocked Barcelona out of the European Cup, they beat Johan Cruyff's Dream Team 4–0 in the 1994 Champions League final, despite being the underdogs.[226][227] In 2013, however, Barcelona made a \"historic\" comeback from a 0–2 first leg defeat in the round of 16 of the 2012–13 Champions League, winning 4–0 at Camp Nou.[228][229] Along with Real Madrid, Athletic Bilbao, and Osasuna, Barcelona is organised as a registered association.[230][231] Unlike a limited company, it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only membership.[232] The members of Barcelona, called socis, form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club.[233] As of 31 May 2023[update], the club has 150,317 socis.[190] In 2010, Forbes evaluated Barcelona's worth to be around €752 million (US$1 billion), ranking them fourth after Manchester United, Real Madrid and Arsenal, based on figures from the 2008–09 season.[234][235] According to Deloitte, Barcelona had a recorded revenue of €366 million in the same period, ranking second to Real Madrid, who generated €401 million in revenue.[236] In 2013, Forbes magazine ranked Barcelona the third most valuable sports team in the world, behind Real Madrid and Manchester United, with a value of $2.6 billion.[237] In 2014, Forbes ranked them the second most valuable sports team in the world, worth $3.2 billion, and Deloitte ranked them the world's fourth richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €484.6 million.[238][239] In 2017, Forbes ranked them the fourth most valuable sports team in the world with a team value of $3.64 billion.[240] In 2018, Barcelona became the first sports team to surpass $1bn in annual revenues.[241] In November 2018 Barcelona became the first sports team with average first-team pay in excess of £10m ($13.8m) per year.[242][243] However, years of profligate spending under the leadership of Josep Maria Bartomeu (president between 2014 and 2020) and other factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, saw the club's gross debt rise to about $1.4 billion in 2021, much of it short-term.[241] On November 9, 2024, Barcelona announced its new sponsership deal with Nike. It is said that it is the highest deal in football history.[244] Since its origins, Barcelona has had a close relationship with the world of culture, especially, with Catalan culture.[245][246][247] The club's statutes from 1932 already said that Barça \"is an association of a cultural and sporting nature\".[248] The club and its players have been a source of inspiration for writers, musicians, visual artists, journalists, cartoonists, theater, and film people.[249][250] In literature, some great Catalan writers they were inspired by the club. In 1957, on the occasion of the inauguration of the Camp Nou, Josep Maria de Sagarra dedicated a poem titled Blau i grana.[251] Poet Manuel Vázquez Montalbán wrote regularly about his vision of the team. Some expressions emerged that caught on in the popular imagination, such as identifying Barça with \"The unarmed army of Catalonia.\" He also wrote that \"Barça is the only legal institution that unites the man on the street with the Catalonia that could have been and was not.\"[252][253] The great anniversaries have been favorable occasions for the club to involve great Catalan figures from the cultural world in its activities. Names such as Josep Segrelles, Joan Miró and Antoni Tàpies have signed commemorative posters, just as Jaume Picas and the writer Josep Maria Espinàs, on the occasion of the club's 75th anniversary, wrote the lyrics for Cant del Barça, the current anthem, with music by Manuel Valls.[254][255] The Blaugrana world has also been a source of inspiration in the plastic arts, with names such as Jordi Alumà, Josep Maria Subirachs, Antoni Tàpies or Josep Viladomat, who made the 'Avi del Barça' sculpture in the La Masia.[256] Salvador Dalí paid tribute to the club's 75th anniversary with an etching.[257] In performing arts, music has also been present, from the tango that Gardel dedicated to Samitier to the songs of Joan Manuel Serrat, La Trinca and many others. Theater has also been a good way to express the feelings of Barça fans, from the El Paralelo cuplés from before the Civil War or skits like 'El Partido del Domingo', by Castaños, to more recent texts, like El culékulé, by Xavier Bosch.[258] In times of political difficulty or lack of freedoms, Barça has been a refuge and means of expression for cultural and artistic activities. In 2013, the club highlighted the 'Barça Cultura' plan, an initiative that promotes the area of institutional relations and protocol with the aim of offering Barcelona as a platform to promote culture in Catalonia.[259] In 2022, Barcelona and Òmnium sign an agreement to promote the Catalan language, culture and the country.[260] There are many documentaries and films that have been created throughout history to capture the successes and journey of the club over the years. More recently, in December 2022, Amazon Prime Video released a five-episode docuseries called FC Barcelona: A New Era.[261] It documented the club by spending time with the coaching staff and players behind the scenes both on and off the field throughout their 2021–22 season. In September 2023, Amazon Prime Video launched the second season with a five-episode docuseries. It focuses on their 2022-23 behind the scenes season.[262] In March 2021, Lionel Messi overtook Xavi's record of 767 games played for the club, and presently has made 778 official appearances in all competitions, while also holding the record for the most appearances in La Liga matches for Barcelona, with 520.[263] Barcelona's all-time highest goalscorer in official competitions is Lionel Messi with 672 goals, surpassing César Rodríguez's 232 goals in March 2012, a record which stood for 60 years.[264] In December 2020, Messi also overtook Pelé's 643 goals for Santos to become the highest official scorer for a single club.[265] Messi is the record goalscorer for Barcelona in European and international club competitions,[266] and the record league scorer with 474 goals in La Liga.[267] Four other players have managed to score over 100 league goals for Barcelona: César Rodríguez (190), Luis Suárez (147), László Kubala (131) and Samuel Eto'o (108).[268] Josep Samitier is the club's highest goalscorer in the Copa del Rey, with 64 goals.[269] László Kubala holds the La Liga record for most goals scored in one match, with seven goals against Sporting Gijón in 1952.[270] Lionel Messi co-holds the Champions League record with five goals against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012.[271] Eulogio Martínez became Barça's top goalscorer in a cup game, when he scored seven goals against Atlético Madrid in 1957.[266] Barcelona goalkeepers have won a record number of Zamora trophies (20), with Antoni Ramallets and Víctor Valdés winning a record five each. Valdés had a ratio of 0.832 goals-conceded-per-game, a La Liga record,[272] and he also holds the record for longest period without conceding a goal (896 minutes) in all competitions for Barcelona.[273] Claudio Bravo has the record of best unbeaten start in a season in La Liga history, at 754 minutes.[274][275] Barcelona's longest serving manager is Jack Greenwell, with nine years in two spells (1917–1924) and (1931–1933), and Pep Guardiola is the club's most successful manager (14 trophies in 4 years). The most successful Barcelona player is Lionel Messi with 35 trophies, surpassing Andrés Iniesta, with 32 trophies.[276] Barcelona's Camp Nou is the largest stadium in Europe. The club's highest home attendance was 120,000 in a European Cup quarter-final against Juventus on 3 March 1986.[277] The modernisation of Camp Nou during the 1990s and the introduction of all-seater stands means the record will not be broken for the foreseeable future as the current capacity of the stadium is 99,354.[278] El Barça de les Cinc Copes is the first team in Spanish football to have won five trophies in a single season (1951–1952).[279][280][281] Barcelona is the only club to have played in every season of European competitions since they started in 1955 counting non-UEFA competition Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.[282][283] On 18 December 2009, alongside being the only Spanish club to achieve a continental treble, Barcelona became the first ever European football team to win six trophies in a calendar year (Sextuple).[284][285] In January 2018, Barcelona signed Philippe Coutinho from Liverpool for €120 million, the highest transfer fee in club's history.[286][287] In August 2017, Barcelona player Neymar transferred to Paris Saint-Germain for a world record transfer fee of €222 million.[288][289] In 2016, Barcelona's La Masia was ranked second by the International Centre for Sports Studies (CIES) as the most top-level players producing academy in the world.[290] The club's original crest was a quartered diamond-shaped crest topped by the Crown of Aragon and the bat of King James, and surrounded by two branches, one of a laurel tree and the other a palm.[32] The club shared Barcelona's coat of arms, as a demonstration of its identification with the city and a desire to be recognised as one.[291] In 1910, the club held a competition among its members to design a new crest. The winner was Carles Comamala, who at the time played for the club. Comamala's suggestion became the crest that the club wears today, with some minor variations. The crest consists of the St George Cross in the upper-left corner with the Catalan flag beside it, and the team colours at the bottom.[292] The blue and garnet colours of the shirt were first worn in a match against Hispania in 1900.[293] Several competing theories have been put forth for the blue and garnet design of the Barcelona shirt. The son of the first president, Arthur Witty, claimed it was the idea of his father as the colours were the same as the Merchant Taylor's School team. Another explanation, according to author Toni Strubell, is that the colours are from Robespierre's First Republic. In Catalonia the common perception is that the colours were chosen by Joan Gamper and are those of his home team, FC Basel.[294][295] Since 1998, the club has had a kit deal with Nike. In 2016, the deal was renewed until 2028 for a record €155 million per year. The contract includes a clause sanctioning penalty or agreement termination anytime if Barcelona fail to qualify for the European competitions or is relegated from La Liga.[302][303] In 2023, Barcelona became the revenue leader from the sale of kits and merchandising in Europe with a turnover of €179 million.[304][305] Although Spanish clubs first began displaying sponsor names on their shirts in 1981,[306] Barcelona held off having a name across the front of the shirt until 2006, when the club signed an agreement to have UNICEF's name on their front.[307][308] Unlike traditional deals, this was not to have paying money to the club, but instead to have the club raise money for UNICEF. In 2011, the club signed its first commercial shirt sponsorship deal, when it reached an agreement with Qatar Foundation.[309] Throughout its history, the club has had various official songs. The anthem in use today is \"Cant del Barça\" (The Song of Barça), composed in 1974 on the occasion of the club's 75th anniversary. Authors Josep Maria Espinàs and Jaume Picas composed the lyrics in Catalan, while the music was composed by Manuel Valls.[316][317] The song was first performed on 27 November 1974 at Camp Nou before the match between FC Barcelona and the East Germany national team by a 3,500-man choir led by Oriol Martorell. On November 28, 1988, in celebration of the club's centenary, the song was performed by Catalan singer-songwriter Joan Manuel Serrat at the end of the festival at Camp Nou. Since the 2008–09 season, el Cant del Barça has been featured on the official Barcelona jerseys. On the occasion of the club's 124th anniversary and with the start of preparations for the 125th anniversary, the club presented a new anthem version recording faithful to the essence of the original score and lyrics composed in 1974, with a better quality and enhanced orchestration and vocals. Composed by the Vallès Symphony Orchestra, the Orfeó Català choral society and the Cor Jove youth choir, it is the current official version.[318][319] El Cant del Barça is turned on before Barcelona games take place at Camp Nou, especially during matches against Real Madrid and just before the start of the meeting. The song is also often played for supporters and fans to cheer, chant and celebrate the victory. Barcelona initially played on different fields, one of the first to represent a fixed venue was the Camp de la Indústria. The capacity was about 6,000, and club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club with growing membership.[320] In 1922, the number of supporters had surpassed 20,000 and by lending money to the club, Barça was able to build the larger Camp de Les Corts, which had an initial capacity of 20,000 spectators. After the Spanish Civil War the club started attracting more members and a larger number of spectators at matches. This led to several expansion projects: the grandstand in 1944, the southern stand in 1946, and finally the northern stand in 1950. After the last expansion, Les Corts could hold 60,000 spectators.[321] After the construction was complete there was no further room for expansion at Les Corts. Back-to-back La Liga titles in 1948 and 1949 and the signing of László Kubala in June 1950, who would later go on to score 196 goals in 256 matches, drew larger crowds to the games.[321][322][323] The club began to make plans for a new stadium.[321] The building of Camp Nou commenced on 28 March 1954, before a crowd of 60,000 Barça fans. The first stone of the future stadium was laid in place under the auspices of Governor Felipe Acedo Colunga and with the blessing of Archbishop of Barcelona Gregorio Modrego. Construction took three years and ended on 24 September 1957 with a final cost of 288 million pesetas, 336% over budget.[321] In 1980, when the stadium was in need of redesign to meet UEFA criteria, the club raised money by offering supporters the opportunity to inscribe their name on the bricks for a small fee. The idea was popular with supporters, and thousands of people paid the fee. Later this became the centre of controversy when media in Madrid picked up reports that one of the stones was inscribed with the name of long-time Real Madrid chairman and Franco supporter Santiago Bernabéu.[324][325][326] In preparation for the 1992 Summer Olympics two tiers of seating were installed above the previous roofline.[327] It has a current capacity of 99,354 making it the largest stadium in Europe.[328] In December 2021, a record 88% of the club members voted in favor of the Espai Barça project to revamp the club's sporting facilities, being the first online referendum in FC Barcelona history.[329] Originally projected to have been completed in 2021, renovation work on Camp Nou began on 1 June 2023 and it is now aimed to finish by the end of 2026, with an estimated €1.5 billion net funding.[330][331][332] During the renovation period, Barcelona will move for the entire 2023–24 season to Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys in Montjuïc, expecting to return in November 2024, with the stadium still under construction.[333] There are also other facilities, which include:[334] Spanish teams are limited to three players without EU citizenship. The squad list includes only the principal nationality of each player; several non-European players on the squad have dual citizenship with an EU country. Also, players from the ACP countries that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement are not counted against non-EU quotas due to the Kolpak ruling.[336] Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules; some limited exceptions apply. Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality. Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules; some limited exceptions apply.

                "content": "The UConn Huskies women's basketball team is the college basketball program representing the University of Connecticut in Storrs, Connecticut, in NCAA Division I women's basketball competition. They currently play in the Big East Conference. The UConn Huskies are the most successful women's basketball program in the nation, having won a record 11 NCAA Division I National Championships and a women's record four in a row, from 2013 through 2016,[2] plus over 50 conference regular season and tournament championships. They have taken part in every NCAA tournament since 1989; as of the end of the 2018–19 season, this is the third-longest active streak in Division I.[3] From 2008 to 2022, they appeared in a record 14 consecutive Final Fours.[4] UConn owns the two longest winning streaks (men's or women's) in college basketball history. The longest streak, 111 straight wins, started with a win against Creighton University on November 23, 2014, and ended on March 31, 2017, when a buzzer-beater at the end of overtime caused a 66–64 loss in the 2017 NCAA Final Four to Mississippi State.[5] The second streak counts 90 consecutive wins, including two undefeated seasons (2008–09 and 2009–10), and was delimited by two losses against Stanford, the first on April 6, 2008, in the National Semifinals of the NCAA Tournament, and the second – three seasons later – on December 19, 2010.[6] The Huskies also own the longest winning streak in regular-season games in college history; after an overtime loss to Stanford on November 17, 2014, they won their next 126 regular-season games until a 68–57 loss to Baylor on January 3, 2019.[7] UConn's current head coach is Luigi \"Geno\" Auriemma, who joined the team in 1985. Auriemma is one of the most successful coaches in college basketball: his 1149–150 (.885) record as of April 2022[update] represents the highest winning percentage among NCAA basketball coaches (minimum 10 seasons), any level, men's or women's,[8] while ranking him second in all-time women's wins behind retired Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer. UConn has also been one of the leaders in women's basketball attendance; the team plays its home games at both the Harry A. Gampel Pavilion in Storrs and the XL Center in Hartford. The UConn Huskies' first ever game was played on December 5, 1974, and was a 40–27 win over visiting Eastern Connecticut State University.[9] After winning their first two games, the team lost the other eight in a 10-game season. The team had a losing record during its first six seasons under coaches Sandra Hamm (1974–75) and Wanda Flora (1975–80), and only one winning season (in 1980–81) in five seasons under Jean Balthaser (1980–85). Prior to the 1985–86 season, UConn hired Geno Auriemma as their new head coach, who had served as assistant coach at Virginia, with the goal of revitalizing the program. Auriemma's training skills had an immediate impact and the team showed steady signs of progress: after going 12–15 in his first season in 1985–86, Auriemma led UConn to winning seasons in 1986–87 and 1987–88.[10] Auriemma pulled off one of his biggest and most important early recruiting successes in 1987 when he convinced an All American from New Hampshire, Kerry Bascom, to come to UConn. Bascom had an immediate impact on the UConn program: in 1989 she won the Big East Player of the Year award as a sophomore (she also won the award in her junior and senior years) and led UConn to its first Big East regular season and tournament title, along with its first-ever NCAA tournament appearance at a #8 seed; the tournament ended in a first round loss to #9 seed La Salle, 72–63. With Bascom and teammates Laura Lishness, Megan Pattyson, Wendy Davis and Debbie Baer, UConn reached the NCAA Tournament again in 1990 as a #4 seed, losing 61–59 to Clemson in the second round after a first-round bye.[11] In Auriemma's 6th season (1990–91) the Huskies broke through on the national scene, again capturing the Big East regular season and tournament titles, and earning a #3 seed in the East Regional of the NCAA Tournament, its highest seed up to then. UConn beat Toledo 81–80 at Gampel Pavilion in the opening round, with Bascom scoring an NCAA tournament single-game record 39 points. The Huskies then moved on to the regionals at The Palestra in Auriemma's hometown of Philadelphia. Here, the team upset heavily favored ACC power North Carolina State in the Sweet 16 by 11 points, and then defeated Clemson 60–57 in the Elite Eight to advance to their first-ever Final Four (also a first for any Big East school). UConn's season ended with a 61–55 loss to top-seeded Virginia in the national semifinals at Lakefront Arena in New Orleans. Bascom was hit with early foul trouble and Virginia held off a late UConn rally. Including all tournament games, Bascom had set a new UConn scoring record with 2,177 points during her years at the school.[12] The 1990–91 season is widely credited with bringing UConn's women's basketball program into the national spotlight for the first time. It also followed the men's 1989–90 \"Dream Season,\" which brought that program into the national spotlight as well. UConn followed up its surprise run to the Final Four in 1991 by landing All-American Rebecca Lobo from Southwick, Massachusetts. UConn had modest success in Lobo's first 2 seasons, losing early in the NCAA Tournament in both seasons. In 1993–94, UConn had its most successful season up to that point;[13] led by Lobo and teammates Jamelle Elliott, Jennifer Rizzotti, Pam Webber, Kara Wolters and Carla Berube, UConn won 30 games for the first time in program history, winning the Big East tournament and regular-season titles. In the NCAA tournament, UConn reached the Elite Eight but came up short in its hopes to make it back to the Final Four, losing to eventual champion North Carolina. With every major player back from 1994, and the addition of Auriemma's most highly ranked recruit to date (Connecticut Player of the Year Nykesha Sales), UConn was in for a season to remember in 1994–95.[14] The season started with an 80-point win over Morgan State; two weeks later, UConn defeated powerhouse North Carolina State by 23 points on the road. This season also saw the birth of one of the greatest rivalries in college sports, the UConn-Tennessee rivalry, that began when the two teams met for the first time on Martin Luther King Day at Gampel Pavilion. UConn defeated Tennessee 77–66 in front of a sold-out crowd in a game televised on ESPN and soon afterwards became ranked No. 1 in the polls for the first time in program history. UConn went unbeaten through the Conference regular season and Tournament and easily advanced into the NCAA tournament. In the Elite Eight against Virginia, a 4-point win (their closest game of the year) secured the team's place in the Final Four at the Target Center in Minneapolis.[15] UConn blew out Stanford in the National semifinals 87–60, reaching the championship for a rematch against Tennessee. In the championship game, UConn found itself in early trouble when Lobo was called for three personal fouls in 94 seconds in the first half. However, in the second half the team was able to rally from a 9-point deficit, and a key Rizzotti layup gave UConn the lead with less than 2 minutes to go. UConn won the game with a final score of 70–64 and claimed their first ever national title. Rebecca Lobo was named the Final Four's Most Outstanding Player. With a perfect 35–0 record, UConn became only the fifth Division I women's basketball team to go undefeated en route to a national championship, and only the second since the NCAA era began in 1982. The Huskies also became the first unbeaten team in NCAA history, all divisions, men or women, to win 35 games in a season.[16] The 1994–95 UConn team was widely credited with increasing interest in women's basketball.[17] The team was honored with a parade in Hartford, CT, that drew over 100,000 spectators. The team won the Team of the Year Award at the ESPN ESPY awards that year, and Lobo became a popular symbol of the sport. UConn also signed a landmark deal during the season with Connecticut Public Television to broadcast their games.[18] Lobo graduated in 1995, receiving countless accolades: the Naismith College Player of the Year award, the Wade Trophy, the Associated Press Women's College Basketball Player of the Year award, the USBWA Women's National Player of the Year award, the Honda-Broderick Cup, the Best Female Athlete ESPY Award (first basketball player ever), the Associated Press Athlete of the Year (second basketball player after Sheryl Swoopes), the NCAA Woman of the Year Award, the Academic All-America of the Year, and made the All-sports Academic All-America of the Year. In 2010 Lobo became the first Connecticut player inducted into the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame, among a class of six inductees,[19] followed by teammate Jennifer Rizzotti in the class of 2013.[20] After the 1995 Championship title, UConn rose to national prominence as one of the powerhouses in women's college basketball, giving coach Auriemma the chance to recruit star talents from high school like Shea Ralph in 1996 and Svetlana Abrosimova in 1997. Starting with their two meetings in 1995, the rivalry between the Tennessee Lady Vols and UConn escalated through the late 1990s and into the 2000s, becoming the marquee matchup in all women's sports, and taking on parallels to the Red Sox-Yankees rivalry in Major League Baseball. Geno Auriemma jokingly once referred to Pat Summitt and Tennessee as the \"evil empire\", like Red Sox president and CEO Larry Lucchino said of the Yankees.[21] In the 1995–96 season, UConn ended Tennessee's home court winning streak at Thompson–Boling Arena in Knoxville. Tennessee avenged itself in the Final Four that year in Charlotte, defeating UConn 88–83 in overtime; the game is often thought to be one of the more memorable tournament games in tournament history with many back and forth swings of momentum.[22] UConn defeated Tennessee during the 1996–97 regular season; after a season-ending injury for Shea Ralph in the first round of the NCAA tournament, UConn reached the Regional Final where the two teams met again, with Tennessee prevailing and ending Connecticut's unbeaten season by winning 91–81.[23] Tennessee defeated Connecticut again in the 1997–98 regular season. A mini controversy erupted in the days after the game when Tennessee's Chamique Holdsclaw was quoted in the papers as saying UConn looked scared during the game; Auriemma denounced that quote.[24] With Shea Ralph and senior Nykesha Sales out for the entire season, freshman Svetlana Abrosimova led a young UConn team to the NCAA Tournament Regional Final, where they eventually lost to North Carolina State 60–52. Auriemma found himself in a national debate following a decision he made during the 1997–98 season. Senior Nykesha Sales suffered a season-ending injury in one of the final games of the regular season. At the time of her injury, she was only one point shy of Kerry Bascom's school scoring record. The next game, with Bascom's blessing, and assistance from friend and Villanova head coach Harry Perretta, Auriemma arranged to have Sales, who was on crutches, score a basket and then allow Villanova to score a basket to start the game at 2–2. Sales then held the school scoring record.[25] Many people weighed in on the decision on both national and local levels. Auriemma felt guilty that he put Sales through the ordeal and was angry that some columnists chose to fault her and not him. Auriemma was criticized for compromising the integrity of the game, but defended the decision saying it was a school record and he would never have done it without Bascom's blessing.[26] Auriemma signed his best recruiting class to date in 1998 when he signed five top-15 nationally ranked players. High school All-Americans Swin Cash, Tamika Williams, Sue Bird, Asjha Jones, and Keirsten Walters were dubbed \"TASSK Force\" by Connecticut fans, using the players' initials. The class renewed hope of bringing more championships to UConn after watching archrival Tennessee win three in a row. The first season for the highly ranked class in 1998–99 featured mixed results and featured many injuries: Sue Bird tore her ACL and went out for the season after only 10 games. In their 1999 meeting at Gampel Pavilion, Tennessee prevailed over the Huskies again. During the game there was a scuffle involving Tennessee's Semeka Randall and Connecticut's Svetlana Abrosimova where Randall threw the ball down, hitting Abrosimova's head. UConn fans booed Randall the rest of the game and Tennessee fans later gave her the nickname \"Boo.\"[27] The 1998–99 season ended in the Sweet Sixteen round of the NCAA Tournament, where UConn lost 64–58 to Iowa State, falling short of reaching the Final Four for the third consecutive year. Motivated by their previous disappointing season, UConn returned in 1999–2000 with the clear goal of reaching championship level again. Led by upperclassmen Shea Ralph, Kelly Schumacher, Svetlana Abrosimova and the TASS Force (the K was dropped when Keirsten Walters had to give up basketball due to knee problems), UConn went through the regular season with a 27–1 record, with their only loss being a single-point defeat to Tennessee at home. The Huskies advanced to their first Final Four since 1996 and defeated Penn State in the semifinals. The team then met the Lady Vols for the championship game in Auriemma's hometown of Philadelphia. Despite the two regular season meetings being close battles, UConn used tenacious defense and backdoor cuts to overwhelm Tennessee 71–52 for their second national championship. Connecticut's final season record was 36–1 and Shea Ralph was named the Final Four's MVP.[28] Auriemma pulled off another huge recruiting coup when he convinced All-American guard Diana Taurasi to travel across country to attend Connecticut. Taurasi hailed from Chino, California, and attended Don Lugo High School where she was the recipient of the 2000 Cheryl Miller Award, presented by the Los Angeles Times to the best player in southern California. She was also named the 2000 Naismith and Parade Magazine National High School Player of the Year. Taurasi finished her high school career ranked second to Cheryl Miller in state history with 3,047 points.[29] With Taurasi joining the core of the 2000 Championship team, Auriemma confidently predicted another championship in 2001, but the season turned out to be more difficult than expected. UConn won the Big East tournament over Notre Dame in a game remembered for the Bird at the Buzzer shot, but lost key players Abrosimova and Ralph to season-ending injuries.[30] As a consequence, Taurasi had to play a much larger role than anticipated in the NCAA Tournament. She led UConn to the Final Four, but in the National semifinals against Notre Dame in St. Louis, Taurasi had a poor shooting game, and despite UConn having attained a 16-point lead at one point, the team lost 90–75. Notre Dame went on to win its first national championship. As with the 2000 champions, who had also come off a disappointing loss the year before, UConn returned hungrier than ever in 2001–02. With the TASS force in their senior season and Taurasi emerging as a star in her sophomore year, UConn rolled through all its opponents throughout the year and maintained an undefeated record going into the NCAA Tournament. The team easily won the Big East regular season and tournament trophies, defeating Boston College 96–54 in the Big East championship game. In the NCAA Tournament, the Huskies were once again awarded the #1 overall seed and demolished their opponents to advance to their 3rd consecutive Final Four. In the semifinals, UConn used tenacious offensive play to defeat rival Tennessee by a whopping 23 points. In front of a record-breaking crowd at the Alamodome in San Antonio, UConn defeated Oklahoma in the championship game, 82–70, to complete a perfect 39–0 season. The starting five of Bird, Taurasi, Cash, Jones, and Williams is widely regarded as the best starting five in women's college basketball history.[31] The championship game that year shattered ratings for ESPN and at the time was the highest rated college basketball game to air on the network, men's or women's.[32] With the TASS force graduated, Diana Taurasi had to carry most of the load in her junior season, with help from returning teammates Maria Conlon, Jessica Moore and Ashley Battle and a top-ranked recruiting class that included Ann Strother, Barbara Turner, Willnet Crockett and Nicole Wolff. With no seniors on the roster, 2003 was supposed to be a rebuilding year for UConn, but as the year progressed it became clear that Taurasi was up to the challenge of carrying a group of young players to the championship game. UConn finished the regular season undefeated and established a 70-game winning streak, shattering the previous mark of 54 set by Louisiana Tech; the streak ended in the Big East championship game with a 52–48 loss to Villanova.[33] In the NCAA Tournament, UConn easily advanced to the Final Four at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta. UConn rallied from a 9-point deficit to beat Texas 71–69 in the semifinals and, aided by Taurasi's 28 points in the finals, defeated rival Tennessee 73–68 to claim the program's fourth national championship. The Huskies became the first team ever to win a championship without a senior on their roster.[34][35] Although the entire team returned and expectations were sky high for a \"three-peat\" in Taurasi's senior year, UConn had an uneven season. The team gave up large leads against Duke and suffered losses to Notre Dame and Villanova, also losing to Boston College in the semifinals of the Big East tournament. The Huskies found their rhythm during the NCAA Tournament, in which they were a #2 seed; in the Elite Eight they beat top-seeded Penn State 66–49 to advance to their 5th straight Final Four at the New Orleans Arena. After beating Minnesota in the national semifinals, UConn again defeated Tennessee to win their 3rd consecutive national championship, winning 70–61. The win was even more special as the UConn men's basketball team won the men's national championship the previous night, marking the first time one University won both the men's and women's basketball championships in one season, a feat UConn repeated in 2014. In her career at UConn, Taurasi led the team to four consecutive Final Fours and three straight national titles. Prior to that final championship, her coach, Geno Auriemma, predicted his team's likelihood of winning with the statement, \"We have Diana, and you don't.\"[36] Taurasi received many personal accolades at UConn including the 2003 and 2004 Naismith College Player of the Year awards, the 2003 Wade Trophy, the 2003 Associated Press Women's College Basketball Player of the Year award, the 2003 USBWA Women's National Player of the Year award and the 2004 Best Female Athlete ESPY Award. Taurasi was the third basketball player to receive this final honor, after former UConn star Rebecca Lobo and Tennessee star Chamique Holdsclaw. She achieved legendary status among UConn fans, and is widely considered one of the greatest players of all time.[37] Relative to their high standards, UConn struggled during the first two years following Taurasi's graduation in 2004. Some of its highly touted recruits did not play up to expectations while others suffered injuries. Taken together during the three years 2005–2007, UConn never made a Final Four, something that had become almost routine (7 final fours in 10 years from 1995 to 2004). The 2004–05 season was marked with sloppy play and ragged offense; UConn lost 8 games and failed to win the Big East regular season crown for the first time since 1993. In the NCAA tournament, UConn lost to Stanford in the Sweet Sixteen.[38] In the 2005–06 season, UConn showed some signs of improvement, winning the Big East tournament and beating Georgia in the Sweet Sixteen thanks to a fadeaway 3-pointer with 1.8 seconds left by senior Barbara Turner.[39] Behind a home state crowd, UConn almost upset #1 ranked Duke in the regional final, before falling in overtime by 2 points.[40] In the 2006–07 season, the team improved their record with the additions of Renee Montgomery, Mel Thomas, Ketia Swanier, and the #1 ranked high school player Tina Charles, helping UConn emerge as a national contender again. UConn was a #1 seed in the NCAA tournament, but eventually lost to LSU in the regional final to end the season with a 32–4 record.[41] After three down years by UConn standards, the team emerged as a heavy contender for the championship in the 2007–08 season. In addition to all of the star players returning from the 2006–07 team, #1 ranked high school player Maya Moore joined the Huskies after a bitter recruitment battle between UConn and Tennessee. Shortly after Moore's commitment to UConn, Tennessee announced they were cancelling the annual series with UConn, thus ending one of the biggest rivalries in the sport. Even if both coaches remained vague and unspecific about the reasons of the cancellation, Tennessee filed a complaint to the NCAA about UConn's recruitment of Moore. UConn was found to have committed a secondary violation (involving a tour of the ESPN campus) and no punishment was handed out.[42][43] Despite losing Mel Thomas and Kalana Greene to season-ending knee injuries, UConn went through the 2007–08 regular season with only a single loss at Rutgers, by two points, winning both the Big East regular season and tournament titles. Rallying from a 14-point deficit in the NCAA regional final, they beat conference rival Rutgers 66–56 and advanced to their first Final Four since Taurasi graduated in 2004. These tournament victories were largely credited to senior Charde Houston, a top-ranked recruit out of San Diego viewed as not living up to expectations from Geno Auriemma and the UConn fans up to that point, who came up with key rebounds and clutch points in those games.[44] In the National semifinals, played at the St. Pete Times Forum in Tampa, UConn lost to Stanford 82–73, ending its season with a 36–2 record. For the third consecutive year, UConn successfully recruited the top ranked high school player in Elena Delle Donne, but shortly before enrolling at UConn Delle Donne requested a release from her scholarship, giving up basketball in order to stay closer to home and play volleyball at the University of Delaware; Delle Donne would eventually play basketball at Delaware, having a great college career that culminated in the #2 pick in the 2013 WNBA draft.[45] Despite losing Delle Donne, the Huskies were ranked No. 1 in the preseason polls, having returned 10 players from their 2008 Final Four team (including All-Americans Maya Moore, Renee Montgomery and Tina Charles), in addition to Kalana Greene (who had recovered from her knee injury by this point). UConn finished the regular season undefeated for the 5th time in school history with a 30–0 record. They won their 17th Big East Regular Season title and their 15th Big East tournament title, beating the Louisville Cardinals in the championship game. The Huskies advanced to their 10th Final Four with an 83–64 victory over Arizona State, and then to their 6th NCAA Championship Game in program history by defeating Stanford, also by a score of 83–64. In the Championship Game, UConn defeated Louisville 76–54 with help from Charles' 25 points and 19 boards, ending the season with a perfect 39–0 record (with every victory by at least 10 points, a record of its own) and sixth national title.[46] For the second consecutive year (and the sixth time in school history), UConn finished their regular season undefeated, with an average margin of victory of 35.9 points. During the regular season, UConn played 11 games against ranked opponents (including 6 in the top ten), winning by an average margin of 24 points per game. They dominated the Big East tournament yet again, winning the championship game 60–32. Throughout the regular season and the Big East tournament, UConn's closest win was against Stanford, by 12 points. Leading up to the Final Four in San Antonio, UConn dominated teams from Southern, Temple, Iowa State and Florida State. Maya Moore and Tina Charles played little more than half the minutes of every game, with Moore averaging one point per minute played, and the team outscoring its opponents by an average of 47 points. In the Final Four UConn was finally challenged by Baylor and the 6-foot-8 freshman Brittney Griner;[47] Baylor trailed 39–26 at halftime, cut the deficit to 41–38 with 15 minutes remaining in the game, but UConn finally pulled away for a final score of 70–50. The national championship game against Stanford was a different story. UConn started the game with its worst first half in school history by scoring only 12 points; only 11 teams in tournament history have been held to 12 points or less in the first half: three of them were against UConn teams, and two of them (Southern and Temple) just days earlier in the 2010 Tournament. Stanford itself only managed to score 20 points in the first half. Maya Moore gave UConn the lead (23–22) in the second half with a three-pointer and led the team on a scoring run of 30–6 that eventually secured the national championship with a final score of 53–47.[48] It was the only game in the Huskies' 78-game winning streak that was won by fewer than 10 points. Moore was named the Tournament Most Outstanding Player, to go along with her second straight Wade Trophy award and Academic All-America of the Year award. Charles, who won the John R. Wooden Award and Naismith College Player of the Year awards,[49] was chosen first overall in the WNBA draft days later.[50] The 2010–11 season began with high hopes but much uncertainty for the Huskies. Maya Moore returned for her senior season after a summer with the U.S. National team, but UConn lost major contributors in Tina Charles and Kalana Greene, who graduated in 2010. Additionally, junior guard Caroline Doty would be out the entire season due to a third knee injury. In an early test, UConn squeaked by #2 Baylor in their second game of the season. They powered their way through 8 more consecutive wins for their 88th straight victory, beating #10 Ohio State at Madison Square Garden. Their 89th win came at home against #20 Florida State to set the college basketball record for most consecutive wins, previously held by the UCLA men's team. After a break in the schedule for the holidays, UConn traveled out west and beat the Pacific Tigers to stretch the streak to 90 games.[51] That game, however, was largely a warm-up match for their biggest test of the season, a December 30 matchup at the powerhouse Stanford Cardinals. UConn trailed for the entire game and lost for the first time since their April 6, 2008, Final Four appearance (also against the Cardinals). The loss ended the highly publicized winning streak, as well as their long-held spot as the top ranked team in women's basketball which was taken over by Baylor. Connecticut recovered focus after the loss and got through the rest of the regular season undefeated, regaining the #1 ranking along the way after Baylor's loss to Texas Tech in February. They marched through and won the Big East tournament, including their 3rd victory of the year over Notre Dame in the Big East tournament Championship Game. In the NCAA tournament Final Four, UConn met Notre Dame for the fourth time of the season, with the underdog Fighting Irish prevailing 72–63 and ending UConn's bid for a third straight national championship. The keys to Notre Dame's success were the stellar performance of sophomore Skylar Diggins and the hot shooting (over 50 percent from the field, a first against UConn in its last 262 games), while UConn had a lack of support for Moore's 36 points.[52] Notre Dame went on to the National Championship Game, but were ultimately defeated by the Texas A&M Aggies. During the 2010–11 season, Maya Moore posted career highs in scoring (22.3 ppg), assists (4.1 apg) and steals (2.2 spg), sweeping all possible individual honors: she won her 2nd Naismith College Player of the Year award, her 3rd straight Wade Trophy (only player in history - freshmen are not eligible for this award), her 2nd Associated Press Women's College Basketball Player of the Year award, her 2nd USBWA Women's National Player of the Year award and her 2nd John R. Wooden Award; she was also voted Big East Player of The Year (3rd time) and a fourth straight unanimous First-Team All-American in WBCA, USBWA and AP polls (second player ever after Oklahoma's Courtney Paris). In her astounding college career, Maya Moore won 150 games and only lost 4, amassing a total 3036 points (1st Husky ever and 4th all-time in NCAA division I women's basketball), 1276 rebounds (2nd Husky ever), 310 steals (3rd Husky ever), 544 assists (6th Husky ever) and 204 blocks (4th Husky ever); she is the only women's basketball player in Division I history to record 2500 points, 1000 rebounds, 500 assists, 250 steals and 150 blocked shots. On February 28, she was enshrined in the Huskies of Honor (3rd time ever for an active player). Maya Moore was also a brilliant college student: she graduated with a 3.7 GPA, earning the Elite 88 Award, and was named Cosida Academic All-America First-Team in 2009, 2010 and 2011, Cosida Academic All-America of the Year in 2010 and 2011 (1st player to ever repeat) and All-sports Academic All-America of the Year in 2011.[53] After graduation, Maya Moore was selected by the Minnesota Lynx as the 1st overall pick in the 2011 WNBA draft (4th time for a Husky), also becoming the first female basketball player signed to the Jordan Brand.[54] The 2011–12 season would inevitably be a new era after Maya Moore's graduation. Her absence and the loss of 6th-man Lorin Dixon left significant holes to fill in the roster. Geno Auriemma seemed to find the right pieces with a freshman class that included Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, Brianna Banks and Kiah Stokes. Mosqueda-Lewis was another State Farm/WBCA High School Player of the Year for UConn,[55] Banks was a highly rated point guard,[56] and Stokes, a 6'3 post player, was highly ranked as well. Other key players included sophomores Stefanie Dolson and Bria Hartley, junior Kelly Faris and senior Tiffany Hayes, who would be all selected in the WNBA draft after graduation. Even if the Huskies were still a strong national contender, they were no longer viewed as a favorite to win it all. Two key rivals were the usual conference foe Notre Dame and the new rival Baylor, who had the nation's top player in Brittney Griner. In December Griner led #1 ranked Baylor against #2 UConn, scoring 25 points to go along with nine blocks. The 66–61 loss was UConn's first of the season, but not its last. Notre Dame, led by junior star Skylar Diggins, beat the Huskies twice in the regular season, but UConn was able to reverse the roles in the Big East tournament Championship Game; the win was the school's 15th conference title, as well as the 800th career win for coach Geno Auriemma. Ultimately Notre Dame found its revenge with an upset win in the NCAA Tournament Final Four, winning in overtime 83–75. The Fighting Irish finished the season with a 3–1 record against the Huskies, a record that would be repeated the following year. The 2012–13 season began with high hopes for UConn. The team landed three highly ranked recruits: #1 overall Breanna Stewart from Cicero – North Syracuse High School, forward Morgan Tuck and guard Moriah Jefferson. Their play was uneven during the regular season, where the team went 27–3 with a loss to Baylor and a pair of losses to Notre Dame (including a three-overtime game in South Bend); in the Big East tournament, UConn lost for a third straight time to Notre Dame, who delivered a last-minute comeback to win 61–59. However, in the NCAA tournament, key-players Stewart, Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, Stefanie Dolson and senior Kelly Faris raised their level of play significantly, and UConn easily advanced to the Final Four. In the National Semifinals, the team handily beat Notre Dame 83–65, a rematch of the 2012 Final Four. Two days later, the Huskies obtained a 93–60 win over Louisville in the championship game to garner a record tying eighth national championship. UConn finished the season with a 35–4 overall record, with 3 of their losses to Notre Dame. The end of the 2012–13 season saw the breakup of the Big East Conference. First Pittsburgh, Syracuse, and Notre Dame defected to the Atlantic Coast Conference, with Louisville announcing that they would follow in 2014. Then, the non-FBS football playing members of the Big East (Georgetown, Villanova, Providence, DePaul, Marquette, Seton Hall, St. John's), known colloquially as the \"Catholic 7\", left to form their own conference, taking the conference name with them. The remaining teams of the former Big East (Connecticut and Cincinnati) joined the new American Athletic Conference (The American or AAC), thus ending the UConn–Notre Dame rivalry in conference tournaments.[57] With Faris and Doty graduated, sophomore Breanna Stewart became the undisputed leader of the 2013–14 UConn team, starting in all 40 games and leading the team with 19.4 points and 2.8 blocks per game; her 291 field goals made was the third-highest single-season total in UConn history. The Huskies beat every opponent by at least 10 points, with their average margin being 34 points, and easily reached the NCAA tournament finals. In the Final Four, the Huskies routed No. 3 Stanford with a 75–56 victory to advance to the championship game. There, they met unbeaten Notre Dame, making it the first matchup of two undefeated teams in the championship game. UConn defeated Notre Dame 79–58 (hindered by the loss of one of their stars, Natalie Achonwa, who had torn her ACL in the Elite Eight) to finish the season 40–0, tying Baylor for the most wins in a season and setting a new record for national championships with nine.[58] Breanna Stewart was named the AP Player of the year, only the third time in history a sophomore has won the honor. With the UConn men's basketball team winning the championship in 2014 as well, UConn became the only school in NCAA history to have both their men's and women's teams win a national championship in the same year, and do it twice (first time was 2004). The 2014–15 regular season started with an overtime loss to Stanford in the team's second game of the season, ending a 47-game winning streak for UConn. Led by juniors Stewart and Jefferson, as well as senior Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, UConn quickly recovered and won every remaining regular season game, including a 76–58 win against rival Notre Dame. In the NCAA Tournament, both Connecticut and Notre Dame were seeded first in their respective playoff brackets; each advanced to the Final Four as well. Connecticut handily defeated Maryland 81–58, while Notre Dame narrowly beat South Carolina, 66–65, in the National Semifinals. The two teams met on April 7, 2015, in the national championship game. UConn won by a score of 63–53 to achieve their third straight national championship and tenth total, with coach Auriemma tying a record set by John Wooden in college basketball.[59] The Huskies 10-point margin of victory in the championship game was their smallest since 2010. Their margins of victory in the 2013, 2014, and 2016 championship games were all above 20 points. UConn finished the season with a 38–1 overall record (18–0 in AAC play). In 2015 UConn landed another top recruit in #1 High School prospect Katie Lou Samuelson; she quickly earned a spot in the starting five alongside sophomore Kia Nurse and seniors Breanna Stewart, Moriah Jefferson and Morgan Tuck. The team was unstoppable all season long, beating every opponent by an average of 39.7 points, and easily winning the conference regular season and tournament. While other #1 seeds Notre Dame, South Carolina and Baylor suffered early upsets in the NCAA Tournament, UConn easily advanced to the Final Four, where they defeated Oregon State 80–51. In the championship game, the Huskies defeated old Big East rival Syracuse 82–51 to complete their sixth undefeated season, while also winning their 11th overall championship and 4th consecutive one. Geno Auriemma became the only coach in college basketball history to have won 11 titles, surpassing UCLA legend John Wooden (who has 10).[60] UConn finished the season with a perfect 38–0 record. Senior Breanna Stewart was named the Final Four Most Outstanding Player for a record 4th straight time; she also performed a back-to-back sweep of all individual honors, winning her 2nd straight Wade Trophy, a record 3rd Associated Press Women's College Basketball Player of the Year award, a record 3rd USBWA Women's National Player of the Year award, a record 3rd Naismith College Player of the Year award and her 2nd straight John R. Wooden Award. Stewart finished with 2,676 points (2nd Husky ever), 1,179 rebounds (4th Husky ever), 426 assists and 414 blocked shots (1st Husky ever). She was also the #1 overall pick in the 2016 WNBA draft.[61] Moriah Jefferson finished with a program-record 659 assists and a back-to-back Nancy Lieberman Award as best point guard in the nation. The trio of Stewart-Jefferson-Tuck ended their college career with a 151–5 record, the most victories for any group of college basketball players; they are the only 4-time winners in college basketball history (freshmen were not eligible to play during the UCLA men's streak). With their eleventh championship win in 2016, the UConn Huskies tied the UCLA Bruins men's team for most college basketball championships, and became the first Division I women's basketball team to win four straight national championships. After losing the stellar trio of Stewart, Jefferson and Tuck, many predicted a sub-par season for UConn standards; the AP Poll ranked the team third in the nation, and coach Auriemma had designed a very tough non-conference calendar to test the strength of his young team. The first regular season game, a 2-point win against #12 Florida State, seemed to confirm the expectations, with coach Auriemma predicting \"a good beat\" ahead.[62] As the season progressed, however, the team quickly found its rhythm, beating ranked teams like Baylor, Notre Dame and Maryland, and showcasing a talented core of young players. With sophomore Katie Lou Samuelson and junior Kia Nurse, the only returning starters, the duo of sophomore Napheesa Collier and junior Gabby Williams quickly rose to national attention; even senior Saniya Chong, who had played only few minutes in her first three seasons, showed great improvements, leading the nation in assists-to-turnovers ratio.[63] Coming from a 75-win streak in the previous season, UConn tied its own previous 90-win record with a 102–37 win against South Florida on January 10, 2017;[64] the 100th straight win mark was reached on February 13, 2017, with a 66–55 win against South Carolina.[65] After easy wins in both the conference regular season and conference tournament, UConn entered the NCAA tournament unbeaten, #1 overall, and once again a heavy favorite to win it all. However, the season came to an unexpected end when Mississippi State's Morgan William hit a buzzer-beater to give its team a 66–64 overtime victory in the NCAA Final Four.[66] The loss ended the streak at 111 consecutive wins, an all-time record not only for college basketball, but also for any team sport played at the college level.[67] UConn's overall record for the season was 36–1. UConn entered the 2017–18 season with high energy. The team gained a 5-star recruiting class that included future All-American player Megan Walker. On December 19, 2017, a win over Oklahoma gave coach Geno Auriemma his 1000th victory in just 1135 games, making him only the fourth women's coach to reach that plateau — preceded by Pat Summitt, Tara VanDerveer and Sylvia Hatchell — and the fastest one.[68] UConn finished the regular season 16–0 in AAC play to win the AAC regular season championship. The Huskies ultimately defeated Tulane, Cincinnati, and South Florida to win the AAC women's tournament title. As a result, they received the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA women's tournament. As the overall No. 1 seed again, they defeated Saint Francis (PA) and Quinnipiac to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. They then defeated Duke in the Sweet Sixteen and South Carolina in the Elite Eight to reach their 19th Final Four. In the National semifinals, they lost in overtime on a last-second shot for the second consecutive year, this time to Notre Dame, ending an undefeated season yet again. Notre Dame would go onto win the national championship with a buzzer-beater against Mississippi State. The Huskies ended their season with a 36–1 overall record for the second straight year. UConn entered the 2018–19 season with another 5-star recruiting class that included Christyn Williams, a highly decorated high-school guard and future 2-time All-Big East First Team player. The team started the year with an 11–0 run, which included an 89–71 win at No. 1 Notre Dame on December 2. The Huskies were ranked #1 in the nation for the next 5 weeks until they lost their first game at No. 8 Baylor on January 3, 2019. Baylor would go on to win the title later in the year against Notre Dame. UConn again finished their regular season with a record of 16–0 in AAC play to win the AAC regular season championship. Ranked #2 in the nation at the start of their conference tournament, the Huskies defeated East Carolina, South Florida, and UCF to win the AAC women's tournament title for the 6th straight year. As a result, they received the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA women's tournament. As a No. 2 seed, UConn defeated Towson and Buffalo to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. Then, they defeated UCLA in the Sweet Sixteen and Louisville in the Elite Eight to reach their 20th Final Four. In the National semifinals, they lost in the rematch of last year's game to Notre Dame, 81–76. UConn ended the season with a 35–3 overall record, their worst since 2013. UConn began the 2019–20 season with a 12–0 run and reached #1 in the AP poll by New Year's Day. Their first loss was against No. 8 Baylor on January 9, 2020, at the XL Center. The Huskies lost twice more against No. 3 Oregon and at No. 1 South Carolina during the regular season. At the conclusion of the 2019–20 regular season, UConn had a record of 26–3. They went 16–0 in the AAC and were the conference regular season champions. Then, they won the AAC tournament for the 7th year in a row, defeating Cincinnati in the title game 87–53 on March 9, 2020. UConn received an automatic bid to the 2020 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament, but the tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The team finished the season ranked number 5 in the AP poll, and with a 29–3 overall record. This was the last year that the Huskies played in the American Athletic Conference, as they left to join several of their former conference mates in the Big East Conference in July 2020. UConn dominated women's basketball during their time in the American, going undefeated in all seven of their regular seasons in AAC play and winning every conference tournament during their membership. The Huskies entered the 2020–2021 season with extremely high hopes. They gained two ESPN five-star recruits with the addition of point guard Paige Bueckers and forward Aaliyah Edwards, as well as future 2-time Big East Defensive Player of the Year Nika Mühl. This season also marked the teams return to the Big East Conference, which they had previously left in 2013 to join the AAC. UConn was ranked no. 3 in both the AP and Coaches pre-season polls. During the regular season, they had a record of 21–1, including 18–0 in the Big East to win the conference regular season championship. UConn won the Big East tournament, winning all three of their games by over 30 points. As a no. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament, they won their region with a narrow victory over no. 5 ranked Baylor in the Elite Eight, 69–67. UConn then lost to Arizona in the Final Four, 69–59, and finished their campaign with a record of 28–2. Bueckers, the team's leading scorer, won several awards at the end of the season, including the Naismith College Player of the Year. The season was heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with numerous game cancellations and no spectators allowed at any sporting events. Returning from a 28–2 season with no graduations, UConn went into the 2021–22 season highly regarded, starting the season ranked 2nd in the AP poll. The Huskies returned three seniors and sophomore consensus 2020–21 NCAA player of the year Paige Bueckers, while adding a 2nd ranked recruiting class that included number-one ranked high school recruit Azzi Fudd. Several athletes transferred during the offseason and early season, leaving the team with 12 players. Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continued to cause game postponements and cancellations. Injuries plagued the team; only two athletes played every game. In December, Bueckers suffered a knee fracture which kept her sidelined until late in the season. With Bueckers out, UConn's offense struggled against several teams, with losses against unranked Georgia Tech and no. 6 Louisville before semester break, no. 9 Oregon in January, and unranked Big East Conference opponent Villanova in February. Coach Auriemma had the team focus on defense, keeping the Huskies in games when their offense was struggling. Nine different players started, and Auriemma tried eleven different starting lineups during the season. By the time Bueckers returned to the lineup for limited minutes, the Huskies were dominating without her. After winning the Big East regular season championship, the team won the 2022 Big East tournament and accepted an automatic bid to the 2022 NCAA Division I tournament, where they were awarded a No. 2 seed. In the NCAA tournament, in the Bridgeport Region, UConn beat 15th seed Mercer, 7th seed UCF, 3rd seed Indiana and 1st seed NC State in double overtime to reach the Final Four for a record 14th consecutive year. They then beat long-time rival and defending national champions Stanford 63–58 to reach the national championship game for the first time since 2016.[69] However, they ultimately lost to the number one overall seed South Carolina, 64–49. UConn entered the 2022–23 season with six returning starters, including the backcourt of Paige Bueckers, Azzi Fudd, and Nika Mühl, as well as forwards Dorka Juhász, Aaliyah Edwards, and Caroline Ducharme. With this line-up, UConn was expected to win the much-improved Big East again and be highly competitive in the NCAA tournament. However, the team became plagued by injuries before the season even began. Bueckers tore an ACL in a pickup game before fall workouts, and five-star recruit Ice Brady suffered a tendon dislocation during an early practice; both players underwent season ending surgeries and sat on the bench all season.[70][71] UConn ultimately finished their regular season with an overall record of 26–5 and a conference record of 18–2. They won the Big East regular season championship and were the top seed in the Big East tournament. Azzi Fudd and Caroline Ducharme, who both missed a significant part of the regular season due to injury, returned in time for the conference tournament. With the UConn squad healthy for the first time since its first games, the Huskies methodically notched three consecutive wins to emerge as the Big East champions, getting the automatic bid to the 2023 NCAA women's basketball tournament, where they were awarded a No. 2 seed. The team advanced to the Sweet 16, where they lost to No. 3-seeded Ohio State, 73–61.[72] This was the first time the team failed to make the Final Four since 2007, and was also the first time they had failed to make the Elite Eight since 2005. After gaining a high school recruiting class ranked #4 in the nation, UConn entered the 2023–24 season ranked second in pre-season polls. However, they lost three early non-conference games and several key players to injury by midseason. On February 7, 2024, Geno Auriemma became just the third college basketball coach to reach 1,200 wins when the Huskies defeated Seton Hall.[73] Later that season, UConn won the 2024 Big East Tournament and was awarded a No. 3 seed in the Portland 3 regional of the 2024 NCAA tournament. Despite being plagued by injuries yet again, the Huskies defeated No. 1-seeded USC 80–73 in the Elite Eight to advance to the Final Four in what Geno Auriemma described as the teams most surprising run since their first Final Four appearance in 1991.[74] However, the team narrowly lost to No. 1-seeded Iowa in the National semifinals, 71–69.[75] National champion Postseason invitational champion Conference regular season champion Conference regular season and conference tournament champion Division regular season champion Division regular season and conference tournament champion Conference tournament champion UConn played in the Big East Conference from the 1982–83 season, the first in which the league sponsored women's basketball and held a tournament, until the conference split in 2013. The Huskies won 18 tournaments in 31 years.[77] From 2013–14 to 2019–20, UConn played in the American Athletic Conference, where they went unbeaten both in regular season and conference tournament games, with a perfect 139–0 record and 7 conference tournaments. In 2020–21, UConn rejoined several of its former conference mates in the current Big East Conference.[57] The Huskies have appeared in the NCAA tournament 34 times, every year since their first appearance in 1989. Their combined record is 128–24 .842; they have been to 23 Final Fours and are 11-time National Champions (1995, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2009, 2010, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016).[78] The following lists where the Huskies have been seeded in the NCAA tournament. Sandra Hamm, a Terryville native, was employed part-time as the interim women's coach in the 1974–1975 season, when the team was 2–8. When she wasn't coaching, she taught physical education at a junior high school in Manchester.[79] After graduating from college in California, Wanda Flora went to graduate school at Indiana University, where she was an assistant coach for the women's basketball team and coached the junior varsity team. After a brief stint at a small college in Pennsylvania, she applied for the job at UConn, starting in 1975 and leading the team to a 38–66 record in five seasons. During her tenure, shooting guard Karen Mullins was the first UConn woman to receive a basketball scholarship; that number had increased to 12 by 1980. In 1980 the university hired Jean Balthaser, who had coached at the University of Pittsburgh. Ms. Balthaser continued to expand the program, leading UConn to its first winning season in her first year as coach, and finishing with a 52–88 record over five seasons. In his 38 years as head coach of the University of Connecticut women's basketball team, the Italian-born Luigi \"Geno\" Auriemma has inextricably linked his name with that of the team. Inheriting a program that had only had one winning season in its entire history, Auriemma has overseen one of the most successful rebuilding projects in college sports history. Under his watch, UConn has become the winningest team in women's college basketball, and he has made a strong case as one of the best coaches ever.[80][81][82] In his astonishing career Auriemma has won more than 25 different national Coach of the Year awards and was inducted into both the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame. He was head coach of the United States women's national basketball team from 2009 until stepping down from that role after the 2016 Summer Olympics. During his tenure with Team USA, they won the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, plus Olympic gold medals in 2012 and 2016. UConn has featured a great number of star players, All-Americans, Hall of Famers and recipients of individual trophies. The following table shows the UConn players recipients of the major individual awards in women's college basketball. After the end of the NCAA tournament, the Associated Press selects a Most Outstanding Player. Seven UConn players received this award since its induction in 1982: Rebecca Lobo (1995), Sue Bird (2002), Swin Cash (2002), Diana Taurasi (2003 and 2004), Tina Charles (2009), Maya Moore (2010), and Breanna Stewart who won 4 times (2013, 2014, 2015, 2016). Statistics correct through December 17, 2024.[83][84][85][86][87] Players active in 2024-2025 are in bold. Most points (1000-point club) Most rebounds (top-15) Most assists (top-15) Most steals (top-15) Most blocks (top-15) Most 3-Point Field Goals Made (top-15) The Huskies of Honor is a program recognizing the most significant figures in UConn history, with plaques in Gampel Pavilion commemorating the inductees. The women's basketball players list includes guards Sue Bird, Bria Hartley, Moriah Jefferson, Renee Montgomery, Shea Ralph, Jennifer Rizzotti, Nykesha Sales, and Diana Taurasi; forwards Svetlana Abrosimova, Swin Cash, Napheesa Collier, Maya Moore, Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, Katie Lou Samuelson, Breanna Stewart, Morgan Tuck, and Gabby Williams; centers Kerry Bascom, Tina Charles, Stefanie Dolson, Rebecca Lobo, and Kara Wolters. On December 7, 2018, UConn announced that the #50 worn by Rebecca Lobo would be permanently retired, effective with ceremonies to be held during the Huskies' final 2018–19 home game on March 2, 2019. In its announcement, UConn stated that going forward, number retirement would be reserved for former Huskies players inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, as Lobo was in 2017. At the same time, the Huskies announced that the #34 worn by Ray Allen, a 2018 Naismith Hall inductee, would be retired by UConn men's basketball, with ceremonies held during the season's final men's home game on March 3, 2019.[88] UConn's announcement did not make it clear whether both numbers would be retired across both men's and women's programs, but a university spokesperson clarified that the retirements applied only to the teams that Lobo and Allen competed for, meaning that #50 remains available in men's basketball and #34 in women's.[89] Additionally, on November 14, 2022, UConn retired the #32 worn by Swin Cash, as she was a 2022 Naismith Hall inductee, with ceremonies held during the women's team game against Texas.[90] Twenty UConn players have been selected in the first round of WNBA drafts. Five of them have been first overall picks: Sue Bird (2002), Diana Taurasi (2004), Tina Charles (2010), Maya Moore (2011), and Breanna Stewart (2016). Rebecca Lobo was part of the 1997 inaugural draft, with the top players allocated to founding teams without any particular order; similarly Nykesha Sales was part of the 1998 WNBA expansion players allocation. In the 2002 WNBA draft, the four UConn players tabbed \"TASS Force\" (Tamika Williams, Asjha Jones, Sue Bird, Swin Cash) were all first round selections, each having immediate impact with their WNBA team.[91] In the 2016 WNBA draft UConn performed even better, with the three seniors Breanna Stewart, Moriah Jefferson and Morgan Tuck sweeping the first three picks for the first time in the history of any major sport.[92] Roster Last update: April 28, 2024 Team of the Decade 2000–2009 In 2010 Sports Illustrated selected the top 25 sports franchises of the decade 2000–2009. The sports under consideration were the four major professional sports (NFL, MLB, NBA and NHL) along with the three most prominent college sports: football, men's basketball and women's basketball. The Connecticut Huskies were the #3 selection on the list, behind only the professional basketball Lakers and the professional football Patriots, making the Connecticut women's basketball team the highest ranked of the collegiate teams for the three sports under consideration.[93] During this period, UConn won five national titles, while making the Final Four seven of the ten years. Two of the seasons (2001–02 and 2008–09) resulted in perfect 39–0 records. Active streaks in bold",

Washington, D.C. – Today, the Senate overwhelmingly passed the Social Security Fairness Act, bipartisan legislation authored by Senators Susan Collins and Sherrod Brown (D-OH), by a vote of 76-20. This bill, which passed the House last month by a vote of 327-75, will restore full Social Security benefits for teachers, law enforcement officers, firefighters, and other public servants by repealing two provisions of current law – the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) – that unfairly reduce the Social Security benefits that public employees receive. Earlier this year, Senators Collins and Brown called on Senate leadership to immediately bring their legislation, which has 62 Senate cosponsors—above the margin needed for passage—to the Senate floor for a vote. Senator Collins held the first Senate hearing on this policy in 2003 as Chair of the Senate Government Affairs Committee. She along with the late Senator Dianne Feinstein first introduced the Social Security Fairness Act in 2005. “In 2003, I held the first-ever Senate hearing on the WEP and the GPO, and I am pleased that now these unfair provisions in our Social Security system will finally be done away with,” said Senator Collins. “This is a victory for thousands of teachers, first responders, and public servants in Maine who, through service to their communities, have been forced to forego their earned retirement benefits. I thank my colleagues for the overwhelming support this legislation has received, as it will help millions of Americans retire with dignity and receive the Social Security benefits they earned through years of work.” More than 25,000 Mainers, who dedicated their lives to public service, are prevented from receiving the full Social Security benefits they earn due to two laws from the 1970s and 1980s. The Windfall Elimination Provision, enacted in 1983, reduces the Social Security benefits of workers who receive pensions from a federal, state, or local government for employment not covered by Social Security. The Government Pension Offset, enacted in 1977, reduces Social Security spousal benefits for spouses, widows, and widowers whose spouses receive pensions from a federal, state, or local government. The Social Security Fairness Act will repeal both of these laws, ensuring teachers, law enforcement, firefighters, park rangers, and other public sector workers and their families receive the full Social Security benefits they’ve earned. ###",

                "content": "Patrick Lavon Mahomes II[5] (/məˈhoʊmz/;[6] born September 17, 1995) is an American professional football quarterback for the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League (NFL). Mahomes has led the Chiefs to six consecutive AFC Championship Game appearances and four Super Bowl appearances since becoming the team's starting quarterback in 2018. He is one of five quarterbacks in NFL history to win three or more Super Bowls as a starter.[7][8] Mahomes's career accolades through seven seasons in the NFL have earned him widespread praise from sports journalists, and he is considered to be one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time.[9][10][11] Mahomes played college football and baseball for the Texas Tech Red Raiders. Following his sophomore year, he quit baseball to focus solely on football.[12] In his junior year, he led all NCAA Division I FBS players in multiple categories including passing yards (5,052) and total touchdowns (53). He was selected 10th overall by the Kansas City Chiefs in the 2017 NFL draft. Mahomes spent his rookie season as the backup to Alex Smith. He was named the starter in 2018 after the Chiefs traded Smith to the Washington Redskins. That season, Mahomes threw for 5,097 yards, 50 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions. He became the only quarterback in history to throw for more than 5,000 yards in a single season in both college and in the NFL. He joined Peyton Manning as the only players in NFL history to throw for 5,000 yards and 50 passing touchdowns in the same season.[13] For his performance in his first season as starter, he was named to the Pro Bowl, named first-team All-Pro, and won the NFL Offensive Player of the Year and NFL Most Valuable Player awards. Mahomes is one of four black quarterbacks to win the AP MVP award.[b][14] In the 2019 season, Mahomes led the Chiefs to Super Bowl LIV, their first Super Bowl appearance in 50 years, where they defeated the San Francisco 49ers.[15] Mahomes was awarded the Super Bowl MVP for his performance, the second black quarterback and youngest overall to do so.[c][16] He is also the third African American quarterback to win a Super Bowl.[d] In 2020, Mahomes signed a 10-year contract extension worth $477 million with another $26 million in potential bonuses, for a total of $503 million, making it the fourth-largest known contract in sporting history.[18][19] The year after signing his contract, he led the Chiefs to their second consecutive Super Bowl appearance, but they lost to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Super Bowl LV. In the 2022 season, Mahomes won his second career NFL MVP and his second Super Bowl MVP in Super Bowl LVII after the Chiefs defeated the Philadelphia Eagles, becoming the first player to win NFL MVP and Super Bowl MVP in the same year since Kurt Warner in 1999, and joined Tom Brady and Joe Montana as the only quarterbacks to win multiple regular season and Super Bowl MVPs.[20][21] In the 2023 season, he won his third Super Bowl MVP after the Chiefs defeated the 49ers in Super Bowl LVIII. Mahomes was born on September 17, 1995, in Tyler, Texas.[22] His father is Pat Mahomes, a former Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher,[23] and his mother is Randi Martin.[24] Mahomes has a younger brother, Jackson, who is a social media influencer.[25][26][27] Mahomes's parents divorced in 2006.[24] His half-brother through his father, Graham Walker, plays football at Brown.[28] He is also the godson of former MLB pitcher LaTroy Hawkins, who was his father's teammate on the Minnesota Twins.[29] Mahomes is biracial,[30] as his father is black[31] and his mother is white.[30] Mahomes attended Whitehouse High School in Whitehouse, Texas.[32] He played football, baseball, and basketball.[33] Mahomes believes that training in pitching and playing basketball improved his quarterback skills.[34] In football, he had 4,619 passing yards, 50 passing touchdowns, 948 rushing yards, and 15 rushing touchdowns as a senior in high school. In baseball, he threw a no-hitter with 16 strikeouts in a game his senior year.[35] He was named the Maxpreps Male Athlete of the Year for 2013–2014.[36] Mahomes was rated by Rivals.com as a three-star football recruit and was ranked as the 12th best dual-threat quarterback in his class. He received offers from Texas Tech, Rice, and Houston.[37] He committed to Texas Tech University.[38] Mahomes was also a top prospect for the 2014 Major League Baseball draft, but was not expected to be selected high due to his commitment to Texas Tech.[39][40][41] He was selected by the Detroit Tigers in the 37th round of the 2014 MLB draft, but did not sign a contract.[42] Mahomes entered his freshman season at Texas Tech as a backup to Davis Webb.[43] He saw his first career action against the Oklahoma State Cowboys after Webb left the game with an injury, completing two of five passes for 20 yards for one touchdown and an interception.[44] After Webb was again injured, Mahomes started his first career game against the Texas Longhorns.[45] He completed 13 of 21 passes for 109 yards in the 34–13 loss.[46][47] Mahomes remained the starter for the season's final three games. Against the Baylor Bears, he threw for a Big 12 freshman record 598 yards with six touchdowns and one interception in the 48–46 loss.[48] For the season, he passed for 1,547 yards, 16 touchdowns, and four interceptions in seven games.[49] Mahomes split time with the Texas Tech baseball team, where he was a relief pitcher.[50][51] Mahomes began his sophomore season at Texas Tech as the starting quarterback. Mahomes helped lead the Red Raiders to a 7–6 season with numerous productive outings throughout the season.[52] He recorded ten games going over 350 passing yards, including four games going over 400. He passed for at least three touchdowns in eight of the games, including a five-touchdown performance against the Iowa State Cyclones on October 10.[53] Overall, in the 2015 season, he led the Big 12 Conference with 364 pass completions on 573 attempts for 4,653 yards, 36 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions.[54][55] Mahomes appeared in three games as a baseball player, recording no hits in two at bats, and three runs allowed, as a pitcher.[56] Prior to the start of the 2016 season, Mahomes announced that he was leaving baseball to focus on football.[50] Mahomes had a very productive junior season. In the month of September alone, Mahomes passed for 18 touchdowns to three interceptions while rushing for four touchdowns. He averaged 442.5 passing yards per game that month, which included a 540-yard game against the Arizona State Sun Devils in the Red Raiders' second game.[57] Mahomes started the month of October with 504 passing yards, two passing touchdowns, and three rushing touchdowns in a losing effort to the Kansas State Wildcats.[58] On October 22, Mahomes set multiple NCAA, Big 12, and school records in a 66–59 loss to the Oklahoma Sooners at home. Mahomes broke the NCAA FBS records for single-game total offense with 819 yards. He tied the NCAA record for single game passing yards with 734. He fell one short of the record for most attempts at 88. Overall, the game set NCAA records for most combined yards of total offense with 1,708 combined passing yards, and total offense by two players (the other was Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield).[59] The 125 combined points are the second most all time involving ranked teams.[59] Following the Oklahoma game, the Red Raiders defeated the TCU Horned Frogs before dropping three consecutive games to finish outside bowl eligibility with a 5–7 record. In his final game with Texas Tech, Mahomes finished with 586 passing yards and six touchdowns in a 54–35 victory over the Baylor Bears.[60] Mahomes finished the season leading the country in yards per game (421), passing yards (5,052), total offense (5,312), points responsible for (318), and total touchdowns (53).[61] For his performance, he was awarded the Sammy Baugh Trophy, given annually to the nation's top college passer, joining head coach Kliff Kingsbury, Graham Harrell, and B. J. Symons as other Red Raiders to have won the award.[62] He was named an Academic All-America second team by the College Sports Information Directors of America.[63] Mahomes announced on January 3, 2017, that he would forgo his last year of college eligibility and enter the NFL draft.[64] Mahomes was projected to be a first or second round pick by the majority of analysts and scouts.[65] During the throwing drills at the NFL Scouting Combine, his passes were clocked at 60 mph, tying Logan Thomas and Bryan Bennett for the fastest pass ever recorded there.[66] Mahomes was ranked second best quarterback by SI.com,[67] third by ESPN,[68] and fourth by NFLDraftScout.com.[69] Representatives from 28 NFL teams attended his pro day at Texas Tech. He became one of the fastest rising prospects during the draft process and had 18 private workouts and official team visits, the most for any prospect in 2017.[70] Among the coaches that he had workouts and visits with were the Arizona Cardinals head coach Bruce Arians, New Orleans Saints head coach Sean Payton, Cincinnati Bengals quarterbacks coach Bill Lazor, and coaches from the Los Angeles Chargers, Cleveland Browns, Chicago Bears, and Pittsburgh Steelers.[71] The Kansas City Chiefs selected Mahomes in the first round (10th overall) of the 2017 NFL draft.[74] The Chiefs, originally slated to have the 27th overall selection, traded up in the draft with the Buffalo Bills for the 10th overall selection. The Chiefs traded their first round pick and a third round pick in 2017, and the Chiefs' first round pick in the 2018 NFL draft for the selection.[75] He was the first quarterback selected by the Chiefs in the first round since selecting Todd Blackledge seventh overall in the 1983 NFL draft.[76] On July 20, 2017, the Chiefs signed Mahomes to a guaranteed four-year, $16.42 million contract that included a signing bonus of $10.08 million.[77] The Chiefs announced on December 27 that, with a playoff spot and the fourth seed in the playoffs secured, they would rest starter Alex Smith and give Mahomes his first career start in their week 17 game against the Denver Broncos.[78] Mahomes played most of the game and helped lead the Chiefs to a 27–24 win, completing 22 of 35 passes for 284 yards and one interception.[79][80] On January 30, 2018, the Chiefs announced they had agreed to trade Smith to the Washington Redskins, elevating Mahomes as starting quarterback.[81] In his first game as the Chiefs starting quarterback, the Chiefs beat the division rival Los Angeles Chargers by a score of 38–28.[82] Mahomes threw for 256 yards and four touchdowns with no interceptions and a 127.5 passer rating and was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[83] His first career touchdown came on a 58-yard pass to wide receiver Tyreek Hill in the first quarter.[84] The following week against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Mahomes threw for 326 yards, six touchdowns, no interceptions, and a passer rating of 154.8 in the 42–37 victory. After throwing his fifth touchdown in the game, he broke the NFL record for most touchdown passes in a quarterback's first three career games. His sixth touchdown pass broke the NFL record for touchdown passes in a season's first two weeks.[85] For his performance against the Steelers, Mahomes won his second consecutive AFC Offensive Player of the Week award, the first quarterback since Tom Brady in 2011 to start the season with back-to-back player of the week awards.[86] Mahomes was named AFC Offensive Player of the Month for September.[87] In week 4, against the Denver Broncos on Monday Night Football, he passed for 304 yards and a touchdown and had one rushing touchdown in the 27–23 comeback victory.[88] In week 6, against the New England Patriots, he passed for 352 yards, four touchdowns, and two interceptions in a 43–40 loss on Sunday Night Football.[89] In the following game, Mahomes and the Chiefs bounced back with a 45–10 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals. In the victory, he passed for 358 yards, four touchdowns, and one interception.[90] In the next game, a 30–23 win over the Broncos, Mahomes recorded a third consecutive game with four passing touchdowns on 303 passing yards and one interception.[91] During Monday Night Football against the Los Angeles Rams in week 11, Mahomes finished with 478 passing yards, six touchdowns, and three interceptions as the Chiefs lost 54–51.[92] His 478 passing yards were the most for a single game by any quarterback for the 2018 season.[93] Following an 89-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Demarcus Robinson in a week 17 game against the Oakland Raiders, Mahomes became the second quarterback in NFL history to throw for 5,000 yards and 50 touchdowns.[94] Additionally, he became one of seven players in NFL history with 5,000 passing yards in a season.[95] He finished second in passing yards to Ben Roethlisberger.[96] He became the first Chief since Len Dawson in 1966 to lead the league in passing touchdowns.[13] He helped lead the Chiefs to a 12–4 record and their third straight division title.[97] On January 12, 2019, the Chiefs defeated the Indianapolis Colts 31–13 in the Divisional Round, giving the Chiefs their first home playoff win since the 1993 season.[98] Mahomes threw for 278 yards with no interceptions and rushed for one touchdown.[99] The win allowed the Chiefs to host the first AFC Championship held at Arrowhead Stadium. Mahomes passed for 295 yards and three touchdowns, but the Chiefs lost to the Patriots in overtime 37–31.[100] Mahomes' performance for the season earned multiple awards. He was named to the 2019 Pro Bowl, he was named First Team All–Pro,[101] 2019 Best NFL Player ESPY Award, and was named Kansas City Club 101 Awards AFC Offensive Player of the Year.[102] He was also named the NFL MVP, the first winner for the Chiefs in franchise history.[103] He was ranked as the fourth-best player by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2019.[104] Playing against the Jacksonville Jaguars in the season opener, Mahomes threw for 378 yards and three touchdowns despite star receiver Tyreek Hill's injury in the first quarter and Mahomes' second quarter ankle sprain.[105] In week 2 against the Oakland Raiders, Mahomes threw for 278 yards and four touchdowns in the second quarter alone, the most passing yards in any quarter since 2008. Mahomes finished the game with 443 yards[106] and was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[107] For the second consecutive season, Mahomes was named AFC Offensive Player of the Month for September after leading the Chiefs to a 4–0 start (10 passing touchdowns with no interceptions).[108] Mahomes dislocated his patella in week 7 against the Denver Broncos.[109] The following day, an MRI revealed no significant structural damage. He was initially expected to miss at least three weeks.[110] He returned two weeks later against the Tennessee Titans, throwing for 446 yards and three touchdowns, losing 35–32.[111] Mahomes ran for a career-high 59 yards, but threw for a career-low (for games he finished) 182 yards in the Chiefs' week 11 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers.[112] In a week 16 win over the Chicago Bears on Sunday Night Football, Mahomes celebrated by counting to 10 on his fingers, alluding to the fact that he was the 10th overall pick in the 2017 draft and that the Bears could have drafted him with the second pick instead of Mitchell Trubisky.[113] He finished the season with 4,031 yards and 26 touchdowns with only five interceptions.[114] He helped lead the Chiefs to their second consecutive 12–4 record and first round bye, as well as their fourth consecutive division title.[115] He was selected to the 2020 Pro Bowl, though he did not play due to his participation in Super Bowl LIV.[116] In the Divisional Round against the Houston Texans, the Chiefs faced a 24–0 deficit early in the second quarter. The Chiefs then went on a 51–7 run, including 41 unanswered points, to win 51–31. Mahomes threw for 321 yards and five touchdowns and rushed for 53 yards.[117] In their second AFC Championship, facing the Titans, Mahomes threw for three touchdowns and rushed for a 27-yard touchdown, the second longest run of his career and longest in the playoffs. He sparked a comeback from 17–7 in the second quarter to a 35–24 victory.[118] The Chiefs made their first Super Bowl appearance since Super Bowl IV in 1970.[118] In Super Bowl LIV, the Chiefs trailed 20–10 against the San Francisco 49ers in the fourth quarter with 8:53 remaining. It was their third straight game facing a 10+ point deficit. With just over 7 minutes to play, a successful 49ers challenge of a completed catch left the Chiefs facing 3rd and 15 on their own 35-yard-line. Mahomes asked his coaching staff to call the play Jet Chip Wasp, and successfully completed a deep pass to Tyreek Hill for 44 yards. This shifted momentum towards the Chiefs, who in the remaining minutes of the game went on a 21–0 run, securing their first Super Bowl victory in 50 years. Mahomes threw for 286 yards and two touchdowns, with two interceptions, and rushed for another 29 yards and touchdown run and was named Super Bowl MVP.[119] He was the youngest quarterback and third-youngest player in NFL history to earn the award.[120] He was ranked fourth by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2020.[121] On April 30, 2020, the Chiefs picked up the fifth-year option on Mahomes' contract.[122] On July 6, he signed a ten-year extension worth $477 million with another $26 million in potential bonuses for a total of $503 million. The contract extends through the 2031 season.[18] The contract is currently the fourth–largest contract in American professional sports history, surpassing Mike Trout's 12-year, $426.5 million contract with the Los Angeles Angels.[123] Mahomes became the first professional athlete to have a half-billion dollar contract.[124] Soccer players Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo and baseball player Shohei Ohtani have since surpassed the contract amount.[125][126] In the Chiefs' week 2 win over the Los Angeles Chargers, Mahomes achieved his fourth fourth-quarter comeback. The Chiefs trailed 17–9 entering the fourth quarter before winning in overtime 23–20. The comeback was the NFL record sixth time he overcame a 10+ point deficit to win.[127] In a week 3 win over the Baltimore Ravens, he threw for 385 passing yards, passing for four touchdowns and rushing for one. In the game, he became the fastest quarterback to surpass 10,000 career yards. It took him 34 games to eclipse Kurt Warner's mark.[128] He was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[129] In week 8, he threw for 416 yards and five touchdowns in a 35–9 victory against the New York Jets.[130] Mahomes was again named AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[131] In a week 9 victory over the Carolina Panthers, he threw for 372 passing yards and four touchdowns.[132] In week 12 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Mahomes led the Chiefs to a 27–24 victory while throwing for 462 yards and three touchdowns.[133] Mahomes was named AFC Offensive Player of the Month for November.[134] In 2020, Sports Illustrated named him one of their Sportspeople of the Year for his activism following the murder of George Floyd and his encouragement for people to vote in the 2020 presidential election.[135] In week 14, against the Miami Dolphins, he tied a career high with three interceptions.[136] Mahomes rested for week 17 after the Chiefs locked up home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.[137] Mahomes finished the 2020 season with 4,740 passing yards, 38 touchdowns and six interceptions.[138] He was named to the Pro Bowl for his accomplishments in the 2020 season.[139] In the Divisional Round against the Cleveland Browns, Mahomes left the game in the third quarter after being tackled by Browns linebacker Mack Wilson. He was diagnosed with a concussion, and as per NFL rules he was unable to return.[140] The Chiefs would win the game 22–17 with backup quarterback Chad Henne. Later that week, Mahomes announced in a press conference that he had cleared concussion protocol, saying, \"Everything has been good. I went through everything; three or four different doctors have said everything is looking good.'\"[141] In the AFC Championship in a highly anticipated matchup against the Buffalo Bills and their dual-threat quarterback Josh Allen, Mahomes threw for 325 yards and three touchdowns,[142] while leading the Chiefs to a 38–24 victory and their second consecutive Super Bowl appearance. Mahomes became the youngest quarterback to start in three straight AFC Championships.[143] The Chiefs hosted the conference championship game for the NFL-record-tying third consecutive year, the other instance was during Andy Reid's tenure with the Philadelphia Eagles.[144] In Super Bowl LV against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Mahomes threw for 270 yards and two interceptions in the game as the Chiefs lost 31–9. It was his first double-digit loss in the NFL, and also the first time since he became the Chiefs starting quarterback that the offense did not score any touchdowns.[145] The Buccaneers defense used two deep safeties to neutralize Mahomes' wide receiver targets.[146] The Chiefs' injury-ravaged offensive line was no match for the Buccaneers' pass rush defense, as Mahomes was pressured on a Super Bowl record 29 of 56 dropbacks while also being sacked three times and hit twice.[147][148] Despite the pressure, Mahomes still managed to throw several long accurate passes that were dropped by their intended targets resulting in incompletions: one fourth-quarter highlight showed Mahomes throwing a sidearm pass, despite being tripped by Buccaneers defensive end William Gholston, that ultimately hit the facemask of receiver Darrel Williams and was dropped.[149] Three days after the Super Bowl, Mahomes underwent surgery to repair a turf toe injury he suffered in the divisional round game against the Browns.[150] He was named as the top-ranked player in the NFL by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2021.[151] On March 12, 2021, Mahomes restructured his contract to save the Chiefs $17 million in salary cap space.[152] In week 1, Mahomes had three passing touchdowns, one rushing touchdown, and 337 yards in a 33–29 win over the Cleveland Browns, earning AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[153] In the Chiefs' week 2 loss to the Baltimore Ravens, he threw his first interception in the month of September of his career. The 36–35 setback marked Mahomes' first loss in the month of September in his career.[154] In a week 5 loss to the Buffalo Bills, Mahomes set career highs for rushing yards with 61 and passing attempts with 54. The 38–20 loss was only his second loss by double digits in his career and his first in the regular season.[155] Two weeks later, the Chiefs lost to the Tennessee Titans 27–3. The Chiefs' three points were the fewest points a Mahomes-led team scored since he became the starter. It was his sixth consecutive game with an interception, the longest streak of his career. He had two fumbles in the second half which gave him the most turnovers he has had in a season only seven games into the season.[156] In the Chiefs' week 9 victory over the Green Bay Packers, Mahomes threw for 166 yards, which was a career low in games he finished. By not throwing an interception for the first time since week 1, he ended a career worst streak of six consecutive games throwing an interception.[157] Mahomes bounced back the following week in a 41–14 victory over the Las Vegas Raiders, where he threw for 406 yards and five touchdowns, an NFL record-tying third game throwing for at least 400 yards and five touchdowns. He joined Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterbacks Joe Montana, Dan Marino, and Peyton Manning as quarterbacks that accomplished the feat.[158] In the Chiefs' week 15 win over the Los Angeles Chargers, he threw for 410 yards and three touchdowns, including the game winning 34-yard touchdown pass in overtime to Travis Kelce.[159] It was his seventh 400-yard game of his career. He finished the regular season with 4,839 yards, 37 touchdowns, 13 interceptions (a career high), and a 98.5 quarterback rating (a career low for a full season).[160] The Chiefs finished the season 12–5, as well as securing their sixth consecutive AFC West title.[161] He earned a Pro Bowl nomination for the 2021 season.[162] The Chiefs hosted the Pittsburgh Steelers in the Wild Card Round, the first time he participated at that stage of the playoffs. Mahomes threw for 404 yards, five touchdowns, and an interception in the 42–21 win.[163] His 404 passing yards set a franchise record for passing yards in a playoff game.[164] In the Divisional Round against the Bills, Mahomes recorded 378 passing yards and three passing touchdowns to go along with 69 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown during the 42–36 overtime win.[165] In the final seconds of regulation, Andy Reid gave Mahomes a motivational talk and told him to be \"The Grim Reaper\".[166] After the two-minute warning and in overtime alone, he threw for 177 yards.[167][168] The game was immediately regarded as one of the greatest playoff games of all time.[169][170][171] In the AFC Championship Game against the Cincinnati Bengals, Mahomes threw for 275 yards and three touchdowns, but also threw two interceptions, including one in overtime in the 27–24 loss.[172] He was ranked eighth by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2022.[173] In Week 1 against the Arizona Cardinals, Mahomes threw for 360 yards and five touchdowns in the Chiefs' 44–21 victory, his sixth 5+ touchdown game. He also had a quarterback rating of 144.2, the 3rd highest of his career and his best since 2020.[174] He was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his Week 1 performance.[175] In Week 4, Mahomes threw for 249 yards and three touchdowns in a 41–31 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, earning his second AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors of the season.[176] In Week 7 against the San Francisco 49ers, Mahomes threw for 423 yards and three touchdowns in the 44–23 victory, his seventh career 400-yard game.[177] In Week 8 against the Tennessee Titans, Mahomes set single-game franchise records for pass completions (43)[178] and pass attempts (68) in a single game.[179] In that game, which was only his 71st career start, he broke the NFL record for passing yards in a quarterback's first 75 career starts with 21,596.[180] The following week, his 72nd start, he would break the record for passing touchdowns in a quarterback's first 75 starts with 176.[181] Mahomes was named AFC Offensive Player of the Month for November.[182] In the Chiefs' week 15 game against the Houston Texans, Mahomes ran for his 12th career rushing touchdown, setting a franchise record for rushing touchdowns by a quarterback.[183] He was named to his fifth Pro Bowl for the season.[184] Mahomes reached 5,000 passing yards on the season in a Week 17 win against the Denver Broncos for the second time in his career.[185] He set the NFL record for most total yards in a season by a quarterback (combined passing and rushing) with 5,608.[186] He also broke his own Chiefs' franchise record for passing yards in a season with 5,250.[187] With the number 1 seed in the AFC, the Chiefs earned a bye week in the first round of the playoffs.[188] In the Chiefs' Divisional Round victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars, a high ankle sprain sidelined Mahomes for much of the first half, but he returned to the game in the second half helping lead the Chiefs to victory.[189] In the AFC Championship game, the Chiefs defeated the Cincinnati Bengals, ending a three-game losing streak (including playoffs) to the team, to advance to their third Super Bowl in four seasons.[190] Against the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LVII, Mahomes re-aggravated his ankle late in the second quarter as the Chiefs went into halftime trailing by 10. However, Mahomes stayed in the game and led Kansas City to a touchdown on their first three drives of the second half, leading the Chiefs to a 38–35 win over the Eagles.[191] He was awarded his second career Super Bowl MVP for his efforts. Mahomes also finished the season as the Most Valuable Player, and was the league leader in both passing yards and passing touchdowns, becoming the first player in NFL history to achieve all four feats in a season.[192] Mahomes was ranked as the top player in the NFL by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2023.[193] On September 18, 2023, the Chiefs and Mahomes agreed to restructure his contract, giving him $210.6 million between 2023 and 2026, the most money in NFL history over a four-season span.[194] In Week 4 against the Jets, Mahomes passed for his 200th career touchdown, becoming the fastest player in NFL history to reach that milestone, having done so in just his 84th start. His 51 rushing yards in the game also allowed him to break Alex Smith's franchise record for most career rushing yards by a quarterback.[195] After defeating the Minnesota Vikings in Week 5, Mahomes became the youngest quarterback in NFL history to defeat all other 31 teams besides their own.[196] In Week 12, Mahomes was 27-of-34 for 298 yards and two touchdowns to overcome a 14-point deficit in a 31–17 win over the Las Vegas Raiders, earning AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[197] Despite meeting these milestones, Mahomes had his worst statistical season to that point in several categories, including yards per attempt (7.0), passing yards per game (261.4), interceptions (14), and passer rating (92.6).[198][199] His receivers struggled at several points throughout the season;[200] going into Week 18, they led the league in dropped passes. Despite this, Mahomes set a career-high in completion percentage with 67.2%.[201] Mahomes was notably fined $50,000 for publicly criticizing the referees of the Chiefs' game against the Buffalo Bills, in which they lost 20–17 after a go-ahead touchdown by receiver Kadarius Toney was negated due to Toney lining up offsides.[202] Mahomes ranted as he greeted Josh Allen after the game, saying \"Fucking terrible. Fucking worst call I've ever fucking seen.\"[203] In spite of these struggles, the Chiefs once again won the division, resulting in Mahomes and several other starters resting in the final game of the season.[204] The Chiefs' playoff run began with a commanding 26–7 win over the Miami Dolphins at home in subzero temperatures in the wild card round.[205] The next week, Mahomes played his first career road playoff game, scoring a narrow 27–24 win over the Buffalo Bills in the divisional round.[206] This win gave the Chiefs their sixth consecutive AFC Championship Game, the second-most consecutive conference championship games for a franchise of all time (the most is held by the New England Patriots with 8).[207] Against the Bills, Mahomes, along with tight end Travis Kelce, broke the record for most career touchdowns in the playoffs for a quarterback/receiver duo.[208] Mahomes then led the Chiefs to a win on the road against the top-seeded Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship to advance to Super Bowl LVIII, marking Mahomes' fourth Super Bowl appearance in five seasons.[209] The win marked Mahomes' 14th career playoff win, tying Terry Bradshaw, John Elway, and Peyton Manning for third place in quarterback playoff wins.[210] In the Super Bowl, Mahomes won his third Super Bowl MVP after throwing for 333 yards with two touchdowns, including the game-winning touchdown pass in overtime to Mecole Hardman, as the Chiefs defeated the San Francisco 49ers 25–22 in just the second Super Bowl in history to go to overtime.[211] Kansas City became the first team to repeat as Super Bowl champions since the New England Patriots nineteen years earlier and Mahomes became the third player with three Super Bowl MVPs.[212] With his victory in the Super Bowl, Mahomes earned his 15th postseason victory, moving into sole possession of third-most in NFL history, only behind Joe Montana and Tom Brady.[213] He was ranked fourth by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2024.[214] Mahomes and the Chiefs entered the 2024 season looking to become the first team to win three consecutive Super Bowl championships.[215] In the NFL Kickoff Game against the Ravens, Mahomes passed Len Dawson as the Chiefs' all-time passing yards leader in a 27–20 win.[216] In Week 3, Mahomes won his 77th regular season start in a victory against the Atlanta Falcons. With the win, Mahomes passed Tom Brady and Roger Staubach for most victories by a quarterback through their first 100 starts.[217] In Week 8 against the Las Vegas Raiders, Mahomes reached 30,000 career passing yards, doing so in just 103 regular season games. This was faster than any other quarterback in NFL history, surpassing the previous record of 109 games set by Matthew Stafford.[218] Mahomes helped lead the Chiefs to a 9–0 start, tying the best start to a season in franchise history.[219] In Week 11, the team suffered their first setback with a 30–21 loss to the Buffalo Bills.[220] Both records are Division I-FBS records. NFL College awards Other awards A former baseball pitcher and considered by some a dual-threat quarterback and the \"most talented player in the NFL\" due to his elusiveness in the pocket, arm strength, running ability, and athleticism despite being a pass-first quarterback,[241][242] Mahomes is also known for attempting and completing innovative throws, including no-look passes and behind-the-back tosses.[243] FiveThirtyEight also cites his unique and \"uncanny\" ability to know his receivers' timing and use his athleticism to fool defenders and get his receivers open.[241] Mahomes credits his years playing baseball with developing his arm strength while throwing the football.[244] Ahead of Super Bowl LVII, which was the first Super Bowl to feature two black starting quarterbacks as the Chiefs faced off against Jalen Hurts and the Philadelphia Eagles, Mahomes acknowledged that his creative playing style was inspired by that of Negro league baseball players, especially Satchel Paige, who likewise inspired his father's baseball playing style.[243] A number of defensive coordinators have cited Mahomes' ability to improvise as one of his key skills.[245] Since Mahomes' breakout 2018 season, NFL general managers and scouts have sought out prospects that can break out of designed plays. Number one overall draft picks Kyler Murray and Bryce Young are regarded as examples of this effect, with the two being highly touted prospects despite lacking traditional size for the position.[246] On September 1, 2020, Mahomes proposed to Brittany Matthews, his high school sweetheart, in a suite in Arrowhead Stadium, the day Mahomes received his Super Bowl LIV championship ring.[247] Matthews had a brief professional soccer career playing for Icelandic club UMF Afturelding and then became a certified personal trainer.[248] She is also a co-owner of the Kansas City Current, a women's professional soccer team.[249] The couple married on March 12, 2022.[250] They have two children: a daughter[251] and a son.[252] In July 2024, the couple announced they were expecting their third child.[253] Mahomes is an evangelical Christian.[254] His mother said he found his faith when he was in middle school, where he was involved with a youth group at his church.[255] Mahomes has said, \"Faith is huge for me ... Before every game, I walk the field and I do a prayer at the goalpost. I just thank God for those opportunities and I thank God for letting me be on a stage where I can glorify Him. The biggest thing that I pray for is that whatever happens, win or lose, success or failure, that I'm glorifying Him.\"[256] Mahomes is featured in the NFL Films and Netflix sports documentary series Quarterback, alongside other NFL quarterbacks Kirk Cousins and Marcus Mariota. All three players were filmed during the 2022 season on-and-off the field. The series premiered on Netflix on July 12, 2023. Mahomes' newly established 2PM Productions collaborated on producing the series.[257][258] Mahomes plays golf during the offseason.[259] He has participated in several celebrity tournaments, including the American Century Championship since 2020.[260] He participated in the 2022 edition of The Match alongside Josh Allen, losing to Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers.[261] He also participated in the 2023 edition teaming up with his Chiefs teammate Travis Kelce against Golden State Warriors teammates Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. Mahomes and Kelce won the match.[262] Following his 2018 MVP season, Mahomes received multiple endorsement deals. His first contract came from Hunt's upon revealing his love for ketchup.[263] In addition, he has signed endorsement deals with Oakley,[264] Essentia Water, Hy-Vee,[265] State Farm,[266] DirectTV,[267] Adidas,[268] and Head & Shoulders.[269] He also signed an endorsement contract with Helzberg Diamonds who released a line of necklaces featuring his logo.[270] He was named the cover athlete for Madden NFL 20, becoming the first Chiefs player to be on the cover.[271] He would be named the Madden cover athlete again, along with Tom Brady, two years later for Madden NFL 22. Mahomes and Brady are the first players to be named cover athlete twice.[272] In 2020, he signed an endorsement deal with sports drink maker BioSteel sports drinks.[273] He also became an equity partner in the company.[274] On August 16, 2021, he announced he would be releasing his own signature shoe as part of his endorsement deal with Adidas. The shoe was called the Mahomes 1 Impact FLX and was released on August 23.[275] In 2022, Mahomes appeared in a commercial for Coors Light. NFL rules prohibit players from endorsing alcohol products, so the product in the commercial was a Coors flashlight instead of beer.[276] In 2023, he appeared in commercials for cellphone provider T-Mobile.[277] Also in 2023, he signed an endorsement deal with the beverage manufacturer Prime.[278] In April 2019, Mahomes announced the establishment of a nonprofit organization called the 15 and the Mahomies Foundation.[279] The nonprofit's website states that it is \"dedicated to improving the lives of children\".[280] Following the murder of George Floyd by police officer Derek Chauvin, Mahomes, along with teammate Tyrann Mathieu and several other NFL players, made a video encouraging the NFL to condemn police brutality and violence against black people and to admit it was wrong to silence Colin Kaepernick and Eric Reid for their protests during the playing of the National Anthem.[281] Mahomes and Mathieu started a voter registration project in Kansas City. The project encouraged residents to register to vote in the 2020 presidential election. He worked with the Chiefs to encourage players to vote. He joined LeBron James' Rock the Vote initiative to encourage people to register and vote.[282] Mahomes was named to the Time 100 list of most influential people of 2020,[283] 2023,[284] and 2024.[285] In 2024, Mahomes donated $5 million to his alma mater, Texas Tech, to assist with stadium and football center projects.[286] In 2020, Mahomes joined the Kansas City Royals ownership group as a minority stakeholder.[287] In 2021, he joined Sporting Club, the ownership group of the Major League Soccer franchise Sporting Kansas City.[288] Mahomes is a member of an ownership group of an upcoming professional pickleball team based in Miami, Florida. The ownership group also includes Naomi Osaka, Nick Kyrgios, and Rich Paul.[289] Mahomes joined the ownership group of the NWSL's Kansas City Current in 2023. His wife has been a member of the ownership group since the team was established.[290] In 2023, Mahomes (as well as Travis Kelce) became an investor in the Alpine racing team of Formula One.[291] In 2021, Mahomes became an investor in a group to expand the Whataburger fast food restaurant franchise to Missouri and Kansas. The locations will primarily be in the Kansas City metropolitan area and the Wichita, Kansas metropolitan area, and multiple locations in between the cities.[292] In 2024, Mahomes, along with the rest of the ownership group of the Current, expressed interest in bringing a WNBA expansion franchise to Kansas City. They cited the success of the Current, the WNBA expanding to add teams in San Francisco, Portland, and Toronto by 2026, and the WNBA hoping to have 16 teams by 2028. The bid is likely to have competition from other cities like St. Louis and Philadelphia.[293][294]",

                "content": "Editions: En/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs Mahomes was a multi-talented athlete before settling on football Patrick Mahomes is known for being one of the most talented quarterbacks to take the field in the NFL. However, the Chiefs star wasn't limited to just playing football when he was younger. During high school he was a talented basketball player, averaging more than 19 points and eight rebounds a game. He also showed his skills on the diamond, with his father having played in the MLB. As a result he spent countless hours playing with his dad, and could have perhaps pursued a career in baseball had things gone differently. Related: While taking part in a \"Would You Rather?\" promotion video with Jake from State Farm, Mahomes was asked whether he preferred basketball or baseball as his 'other sport' aside from football. Despite baseball being in the family, Mahomes went the other way and picked the hard court: \"100 percent basketball.\" Mahomes' basketball career was profiled by ESPN earlier this year. The piece included Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry complimenting Mahomes for his creativity on the court, though he noted that his jump shot needed some work. \"It goes in...in doesn't always have to be pretty. I'm not gonna shoot like Steph,\" was Mahomes' response. Known for his playmaking skills on the field and his ability to get away from defenders, Mahomes believes he developed those skills while playing basketball. \"The skills of playing the point guard position specifically really helped me... if you watch me scrambling around, it's the same thing,\" said Mahomes. \"I look like I'm moving slow, but I'm getting where I need to get to. And I feel like in basketball, I was the same way.\" © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved. Follow us",

                "title": "Kirk Cousins - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Kirk Daniel Cousins (born August 19, 1988) is an American professional football quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Michigan State Spartans and was selected by the Washington Redskins in the fourth round of the 2012 NFL draft. Cousins ranks sixth all-time in completion percentage with at least 1,500 pass attempts[2] and is 11th in the NFL's all-time regular season career passer rating. Cousins spent his first three seasons with the Redskins as a backup to Robert Griffin III before replacing an injured Griffin in 2015 and leading the team to a division title. With Washington, Cousins set several franchise records and was named to the 2017 Pro Bowl. After two years of signing franchise tags and being unable to agree with the team on a long-term deal, Cousins signed a fully guaranteed three-year US$84 million contract with the Minnesota Vikings as a free agent in 2018. In six seasons with the Vikings, he earned three Pro Bowl selections and ranks third in the Vikings' all-time passing yards list. Cousins signed a four-year deal with the Falcons in 2024. Kirk Cousins was born to Don Cousins[3] and Maryann Cousins, the second oldest of their three children. Born in Barrington, Illinois[4][5] on August 19, 1988,[4] Cousins attended Holland Christian High School in Holland, Michigan, where he starred in football, baseball (as a third baseman and a pitcher), and basketball for the Maroons athletic teams. He broke his ankle in his junior year and was forced to attend camps in order to make an impression with recruiting colleges.[6] Cousins finished his high school football career with 3,204 passing yards, 40 touchdowns, and 18 interceptions.[7] After high school, Cousins was set to sign with Toledo or Western Michigan, until Mark Dantonio became the head coach at Michigan State in 2007. After Dantonio failed to sign his top targets at quarterback, he offered a scholarship to Cousins, which he accepted. He also participated in the Athletes in Action sports ministry.[citation needed] Sources: Cousins redshirted for the 2007 season.[8] In 2008, he spent the season as the backup quarterback to Brian Hoyer. He played in five games passing for a total of 310 yards and two touchdowns and one interception.[9][10] In 2009, he competed for and won the starting quarterback job against teammate Keith Nichol. He led Michigan State to a 6–7 (4–4) season with 19 touchdowns, nine interceptions and 2,680 passing yards in 12 games.[11] In 2010, he led Michigan State to an 11–2 (7–1) record and a share of the Big Ten Conference Championship.[12][13][14] In 2011, the Spartans went 11–3 (7–2) and played in the first-ever Big Ten Football Championship Game.[15][16] He led the Big Ten Conference in pass completions, pass attempts, and passing yards in 2011.[17] Cousins was named second-team All-Big Ten by the coaches, and played his final game as a Michigan State Spartan on January 2, 2012, defeating the Georgia Bulldogs in the Outback Bowl.[18] His teams posted an undefeated 4–0 record against the in-state rival Michigan Wolverines.[19] Cousins won the 2011 Lowes's Senior CLASS Award.[20] Cousins majored in kinesiology.[21] Cousins was selected by the Washington Redskins as the seventh choice in the fourth round of the 2012 NFL draft, making him the 102nd draft pick overall.[25] The pick surprised many analysts, as the Redskins had drafted 2011 Heisman Trophy winner Robert Griffin III with the second overall pick to be their franchise quarterback. The Redskins acquired the Griffin pick by giving the St. Louis Rams four high-value draft picks over three years.[26] Cousins was viewed as an insurance policy in case Griffin was injured, with Redskins head coach Mike Shanahan saying \"You're one or two plays away from being the starter...And if I see that value out there on the third day of the draft, I'm going to take that.\"[27] The Redskins drafting Griffin and Cousins in the same draft echoed the team's strategy in the 1994 NFL draft, when the team drafted Heath Shuler with the third overall pick and later drafted Gus Frerotte in the seventh round.[28] On May 31, 2012, Cousins signed a four-year contract with the Redskins.[29] In the second game of the preseason against the Chicago Bears, Cousins threw three touchdowns in the fourth quarter, though the Redskins would go on to lose 33–31.[30] In the fourth and final game of preseason, against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Cousins completed 15 of 27 passes for 222 yards as the Redskins won 30–3. He was named the backup quarterback over incumbent starter Rex Grossman. Cousins made his NFL debut in the third quarter of a Week 5 loss to the Atlanta Falcons after Griffin suffered a concussion. Cousins threw his first NFL touchdown pass on a 77-yard pass to Santana Moss but threw two interceptions in the last two series of the game while trying to tie the game.[31] Cousins' second NFL appearance came in Week 14 against the Baltimore Ravens. On the final drive of the game, with the Redskins down 8, Griffin suffered a knee injury. Cousins went 2–2 and finished the drive with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Pierre Garçon with 29 seconds remaining, to bring the Redskins within 2 points of the Ravens. On the two-point conversion, Shanahan called for a run-pass option, and Cousins scored on a quarterback draw to tie the game at 28. The Redskins would win in overtime 31–28.[32] The following week, on December 15, 2012, Cousins was announced as the Redskins starter for the Week 15 game against the Cleveland Browns, marking his first NFL start.[33] After a slow first half, Cousins rallied the offense to a 28-point second half. Cousins finished the day 26-of-37 for 329 yards with 2 touchdown passes, bringing the Redskins a 38–21 win.[34][35] Later that week, Cousins was voted the Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Week, becoming the third Redskins rookie to receive the honor that season (after Griffin and Alfred Morris).[36] Cousins finished his rookie year with 466 passing yards, four touchdowns, and three interceptions in three games and one start.[37] The Redskins finished atop the NFC East with a 10–6 record.[38] In the Wild Card Round, they faced the Seattle Seahawks. In the 24–14 loss, Cousins came into the game late in the fourth quarter in relief of an injured Griffin. He finished the game 3-of-10 for 31 yards and was unable to rally the team to victory.[39] On December 11, 2013, Cousins was named starting quarterback for the rest of the year after Shanahan deactivated Robert Griffin III for the remainder of the season in order to protect him for the following year, with Rex Grossman as Cousins's backup.[40][41] In Week 15, in a narrow 27–26 loss to the Falcons, he finished 29-of-45 for 381 yards, three touchdowns, and two interceptions.[42] Cousins finished his second professional season with 854 passing yards, four touchdowns, and seven interceptions in five games and three starts.[43] On February 2, 2014, it was reported that Cousins had stated that he was open to a trade from the Redskins.[44] In March, Cousins announced that he would be giving the #12 jersey to incoming new wide receiver Andre Roberts for the price of a $12,000 donation to the Kirk Cousins Football Camp. Cousins then switched over to the #8 jersey, a number he wore throughout his high school and college career.[45] During Week 2 against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Cousins came in relief of Griffin who left the game with a dislocated ankle. Cousins finished the game with 250 passing yards and two touchdowns in a 41–10 victory.[46] In the next game against the Philadelphia Eagles, Cousins threw for 427 yards, the first game he had over 400 passing yards. Washington still lost an ensuing slugfest to the Eagles 37–34.[47] The following week against the New York Giants, Cousins had a poor showing, throwing for a touchdown with four interceptions and a lost fumble.[48] The Redskins were blown out 45–14 with a total of 6 turnovers. In Week 5, against the defending Super Bowl champion Seahawks, Cousins showed progress from the embarrassing loss to the Giants by throwing for two touchdowns without an interception, including a 68-yard touchdown pass to DeSean Jackson. Despite the solid performance from Cousins, the Redskins lost by a score of 27–17.[49] Following a poor performance in the first half in the Week 7 game against the Tennessee Titans, he was benched at halftime in favor of backup quarterback Colt McCoy, and did not play in any more games for the remainder of the season.[50] On August 31, 2015, Cousins was named the starter for the season over Robert Griffin III.[51] On October 4, Cousins led a 90-yard game-winning drive against the Eagles, his first since 2012, when he threw a touchdown pass to Pierre Garçon with under a minute left in the fourth quarter, winning the game 23–20.[52] On October 25, Cousins helped lead the Redskins to their largest comeback win in franchise history. After being down 24–0 in the second quarter against the Buccaneers at home, Cousins finished with 317 yards and four total touchdowns, three passing and one rushing, throwing the final touchdown pass to Jordan Reed in the final seconds of the game.[53] Cousins also tied a franchise record for completions in a game with 33, tying Jason Campbell who did the same in 2007. When heading into the locker room after the game, Cousins was caught on camera shouting, \"You like that?!\" to reporters, which later become a catchphrase used by Cousins, his teammates, and Redskins fans throughout the rest of the season.[54] Cousins and his brother Kyle applied to trademark the catchphrase later in the season and began to sell T-shirts with the phrase to raise money for the International Justice Mission charitable organization.[55][56][57][58] He was named National Football Conference (NFC) Offensive Player of the Week for his game against Tampa Bay.[59] Against the New Orleans Saints on November 15, Cousins threw for a career-high four touchdowns, as well as posting a perfect passer rating of 158.3, making him the first Redskins quarterback since 1950 to do that with at least 20 attempts.[a][60][61] He was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week for this game against the Saints.[62] Against the Buffalo Bills on December 20, Cousins passed for four touchdowns, and ran for another in a Redskins victory, marking his second four-touchdown passing game of the season.[63] The following week against the Eagles, Cousins took an ill-advised quarterback kneel inside the Eagles' redzone with six seconds left before halftime, running out the clock and forgoing any chance of adding upon Washington's lead.[64] Despite that, Cousins eventually passed for four touchdowns in the game, his second consecutive four-touchdown performance and third overall on the season. The performance led to the Redskins' victory over the Eagles with a score of 38–24, which allowed the team to win the NFC East division title for the first time since Griffin III did it in 2012.[65][66] Cousins was named NFC Offensive Player of the Month for December.[67] Cousins finished the 2015 season posting the highest completion percentage (74.7) in home games in NFL history, with a minimum of 100 attempts, leading the Redskins to a 6–2 record at home.[68] He also became the first Redskins quarterback since Sonny Jurgensen in 1970 to have at least four passing touchdowns in three or more games in one season.[69] Against the Dallas Cowboys on January 3, 2016, he set the Redskins single-season passing yardage record with 4,166, passing Jay Schroeder who had 4,109 in 1986.[70] He also finished the season with 29 passing touchdowns, second in Redskins history behind Jurgensen who had 31 in 1967, while posting a league-leading completion percentage of 69.8%, second in team history behind Sammy Baugh who completed 70.3% of his passes in 1945.[70] Against the Green Bay Packers in the Wild Card Round on January 10, 2016, Cousins completed 29-of-46 passes for 329 yards and scored two touchdowns (one passing, one rushing), but was sacked six times and lost one fumble. The Redskins lost 35–18, ending their season.[71] He was named the PFWA Most Improved Player.[72] He was ranked 85th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016.[73] Cousins was set to become an unrestricted free agent in the 2016 offseason, but the Redskins used the non-exclusive franchise tag on him on March 1, 2016. The tag acted as a one-year, $20 million contract, which prevented other teams in the league from signing him without giving up two first round draft picks to the Redskins.[74][75] During the Week 8 International Series game against the Cincinnati Bengals at Wembley Stadium in London, Cousins threw for a career-high 458 passing yards, as the game ended in a 27–27 tie.[76] As the game ended in a tie, it also marked the first time a game held in London went into overtime. Three weeks later against the Packers, Cousins threw for 375 yards along with three touchdowns in a 42–24 victory, earning him his third NFC Offensive Player of the Week award.[77] After the game, Cousins was caught on camera asking Redskins general manager Scot McCloughan \"How you like me now?\" which many in the media believed Cousins was addressing concerns about his potentially lucrative long-term contract with the team next season.[78] In a Thanksgiving Day 31–26 road loss against the Cowboys, Cousins completed 41 of 53 passes for 449 yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions, putting him second on the list of most passing yards in a Thanksgiving Day game in NFL history.[79] For his accomplishments in the month of November, Cousins won the NFC Offensive Player Of The Month award, his second time winning the award.[80][81] In Week 16, on Christmas Eve, against the Bears, Cousins had a career-high two rushing touchdowns in the 41–21 road victory.[82] Despite missing the playoffs, Cousins led the team to a winning record of 8–7–1 and finished the season with a career-high 4,917 passing yards, which was third in the NFL behind Drew Brees and Matt Ryan, breaking various personal and team records he had set the previous year.[83][84] Cousins' 67% completion percentage ranked No. 7 and his 45.7% deep-ball completion percentage ranked No. 5 among NFL quarterbacks in 2016.[85] Due to his performance in the season, Cousins was named to his first Pro Bowl, replacing Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan, who could not take part in the game due to the Falcons' appearance in Super Bowl LI.[86] During the game, Cousins played throughout most of the second half, and notably forced a fumble on Denver Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib after chasing him down the field after throwing an interception late in the fourth quarter.[87] Cousins was also ranked 70th by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017.[88] Again set to become an unrestricted free agent in the offseason, Cousins and the Redskins attempted to work out a long-term deal before the start of free agency, but could only come to an agreement on the exclusive franchise tag on February 28, 2017, becoming the first quarterback in NFL history to be franchise-tagged in consecutive years.[89] During a Week 3 27–10 victory over the Oakland Raiders on NBC Sunday Night Football, Cousins went 25-for-30 for a season-high 365 yards and three touchdowns, earning him his fourth NFC Offensive Player of the Week award of his career.[90][91][92] During Week 10 against the Minnesota Vikings, Cousins tied his single-game career-high with two rushing touchdowns in the 38–30 loss.[93] The Redskins finished the 2017 season with a 7–9 record and missed the playoffs.[94] Cousins finished the season 347-of-540 for 4,093 yards, 27 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions.[95] The 2017 season marked his third consecutive season of passing for at least 4,000 yards. In addition to his passing totals, he rushed 49 times for 179 yards and four rushing touchdowns. Cousins was ranked 94th by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2018.[96] On March 15, 2018, Cousins signed with the Vikings on a fully guaranteed three-year contract worth $84 million.[97] This was the first fully guaranteed and, as of signing, highest paying contract in NFL history.[98] In his Vikings debut in the season opener against the San Francisco 49ers, Cousins passed for 244 yards and two touchdowns in the 24–16 victory.[99] In the next game against the Packers, he finished with 425 passing yards, four touchdowns, and an interception as the game ended in a 29–29 tie.[100] Two weeks later against the Los Angeles Rams on Thursday Night Football, Cousins threw for 422 yards and three touchdowns in the 38–31 road loss.[101] Despite Cousins's strong statistical start to the season, inconsistency within the offense and coaching staff ended up impacting the Vikings' season. With the Vikings at 6–5–1 going into Week 14 against the Seahawks, the Vikings were still in the playoff hunt, but a 21–7 road loss on Monday Night Football resulted in the firing of offensive coordinator John DeFilippo.[102] The Vikings won their next two games, against the Miami Dolphins and Detroit Lions, with Cousins passing for five touchdowns and an interception combined.[103][104] In the regular-season finale against the Bears, the Vikings would have made the playoffs with a win, but they fell 24–10, with Cousins passing for 132 yards and a touchdown.[105] Cousins finished his first season with the Vikings with 4,298 passing yards, 30 touchdowns, and 10 interceptions to go along with 123 rushing yards and a touchdown.[106] He was ranked 78th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2019.[107] During the season-opener against the Falcons, Cousins completed 8 of 10 passes for 98 yards and a touchdown in the 28–12 win.[108] In the next game against the Packers, he completed 14 passes for 230 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions in the 21–16 road loss.[109] The following week against the Raiders, Cousins completed 15 passes for 174 yards, including a 35-yard touchdown pass, in the 34–14 win.[110] In Week 4, against the Bears, he had two fumbles and no passing touchdowns but still passed 27 times for 233 yards in the 16–6 road loss.[citation needed] In the next game, against the Giants, Cousins completed 22 passes for 306 yards and two touchdowns in the 28–10 road victory.[111] The following week against the Eagles, he threw for 333 yards, four touchdowns, and an interception in the 38–20 win.[112] During Week 7 against the Lions, Cousins passed for 337 yards and four touchdowns in the 42–30 road victory.[113] He was named NFC Offensive Player of the Month for October.[114] During Week 11 against the Broncos, Cousins threw for 319 yards and three touchdowns as the Vikings overcame a 20-point first half deficit and won 27–23.[115] Two weeks later against the Seahawks on Monday Night Football, he threw for 276 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception in the 37–30 road loss, extending Cousins' record on Mondays to an 0–8 record.[116] During Week 16 against the Packers once again on Monday Night Football, Cousins threw for 122 yards, a touchdown, and an interception in the 23–10 loss.[117] The Packers clinched the NFC North division title with the win. It also extended Cousins' record on Monday Night Football to 0–9.[118] With the Vikings' playoff position set, Cousins did not play in the regular-season finale against the Bears.[119] He finished the 2019 season with 3,603 passing yards, 26 passing touchdowns, and six interceptions to go along with 63 rushing yards and a touchdown.[120] Cousins was also named to his second career Pro Bowl.[121] In the NFC Wild Card Round against the Saints, Cousins threw for 242 yards and the game winning touchdown to tight end Kyle Rudolph in overtime during the 26–20 road victory.[122] In the Divisional Round against the 49ers, Cousins threw for 172 yards, a touchdown, and an interception in the 27–10 road loss.[123] He was ranked 58th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2020.[124] On March 18, 2020, Cousins signed a two-year, $66 million contract extension with the Vikings.[125] During Week 2 against the Indianapolis Colts, Cousins threw for 113 yards and three interceptions during the 28–11 road loss. He finished the game with a total quarterback rating of 15.9, the third-lowest mark in Vikings franchise history.[126] In Week 3 against the Titans, Cousins had a much better outing, throwing for 251 yards, three touchdowns, and two interceptions during the narrow 31–30 loss.[127] The following week against the Houston Texans, Cousins threw for 260 yards and a touchdown during the 31–23 road victory, the Vikings' first win of the season.[128] Two weeks later against the Falcons, Cousins threw for 343 yards, three touchdowns, and three interceptions during the 40–23 loss.

This was Cousins' first ever Monday Night Football win after previously going 0–9 in his career.[131] During Week 11 against the Cowboys, Cousins threw for 318 yards and three touchdowns during the 31–28 loss.[132] In the next game against the Carolina Panthers, he threw for 307 yards and three touchdowns in the narrow 28–27 comeback victory. This was Cousins' fourth straight game with a passer rating over 100.[133] He was named the NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance.[134] The following week against the Jaguars, Cousins threw for 305 yards, three touchdowns, and an interception in the 27–24 overtime victory.[135] Three weeks later against the Saints on Christmas Day, he threw for 291 yards and three touchdowns during the 33–52 road loss, eliminating the Vikings from postseason contention.[136] In the regular-season finale against the Lions, Cousins threw for 405 yards and three touchdowns and rushed for another during the 37–35 road victory.[137] He was named the NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance.[138] Cousins finished the season with 4,265 passing yards, 35 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions to go along with 156 rushing yards and a touchdown.[139] Cousins started the 2021 season with 351 passing yards and two touchdowns in a 27–24 overtime road loss to the Bengals.[140] In Week 11 against the Packers, Cousins threw 24 completions of 35 attempts with 341 passing yards and three passing touchdowns in a 34–31 victory.[141] In Week 13 against the Lions, Cousins went for 30-of-40 passes for 340 yards with two touchdowns in a 27–29 defeat.[142] Cousins drew controversy over his decision not to receive the COVID-19 vaccination, although he agreed to follow NFL protocols. In response to his comments, which drew from a personal decision, Holland Hospital, with whom Cousins had served as spokesperson, announced they were discontinuing Cousins' role indefinitely.[143] Prior to Week 17, Cousins was placed on the COVID-19 reserve list and ruled out for the game against the Packers,[144] which they lost 37–10, eliminating them from playoff contention.[145] Cousins finished the season with 4,221 passing yards, 33 touchdowns, and seven interceptions to go along with 115 rushing yards and a touchdown.[146] He was nominated to his third Pro Bowl of his career.[147] He was ranked 99th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2022.[148] On March 13, 2022, Cousins signed a one-year, $35 million fully guaranteed contract extension through the 2023 season.[149] In the season opener against the Packers, Cousins threw 23-of-32 passes for 277 yards with two touchdowns, and a 118.9 passer rating in 23–7 victory.[150] In the following week against the Eagles on Monday Night Football, Cousins passed 27 completions of 46 attempts for 221 yards with one touchdown and three interceptions in a 7–24 blowout loss.[151] In Week 5 against the Bears, Cousins completed a one–yard touchdown pass to Jalen Reagor for his 19th consecutive completion (17 to open to game, and 2 from Week 4 against the Saints. The feat broke Tommy Kramer's team record of 16 consecutive completions, which he set during the 1979 season.[152] In Week 6 against the Dolphins, Cousins threw for 175 yards and two touchdowns in a 24–16 win.[153][154] In the following bye week, Cousins completed 24 of 36 passes for 232 passing yards and two touchdowns in 34–26 victory against the Arizona Cardinals.[155][156] In Week 10 against the Bills, Cousins completed 30-of-50 passes for 357 passing yards with one passing touchdown and two interceptions in 33–30 overtime win.[157][158] In Week 14, against the Lions, Cousins passed for 425 yards and two touchdowns in the 34–23 loss.[159] In a week 15 game against the Colts, Cousins completed 34 of 54 passes for a career-high 460 passing yards, four touchdowns, and two interceptions with a 99.3 passer rating in the 39–36 overtime win, highlighted by the Vikings completing the largest comeback in NFL history.[160][161] With the win, the Vikings also clinched the NFC North for the first time since 2017.[162] For this, Cousins was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week for Week 15.[163] The next week, on a Christmas Eve matchup against the Giants at home, Cousins completed 34 passes for 299 yards and three touchdowns in a 27–24 win, in which he orchestrated a last-minute drive that culminated in kicker Greg Joseph making the longest field goal in Vikings' history, a 61-yard attempt, to defeat the Giants.[164][165] His eight game-winning drives led the NFL for the 2022 season and tied the NFL record (since 1960) for a single season with Matthew Stafford's 2016 season.[166] He was named as a Pro Bowler for his 2022 season.[167] For the 2022 season, Cousins finished with 4,547 passing yards, 29 touchdowns, and 14 interceptions to go along with two rushing touchdowns.[168] He started all 17 of the teams' games, leading them to a 13–4 record, alongside a NFC North title.[169] Seeded third, the Vikings faced off against the sixth-seeded Giants in the Wild Card Round, on January 15, 2023. Playing at home, Cousins had a solid individual game, completing 31-of-39 passes for 273 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions, alongside a rushing touchdown. His two passing touchdowns were to K. J. Osborn and Irv Smith Jr.[170] Despite his efforts, the Vikings defense were stymied by a Giants offense led by Daniel Jones, who passed for over 300 yards and two touchdowns, with an additional 78 rushing yards, defeating the Vikings 31–24.[171] In the season opener against the Buccaneers, Cousins went 33 completions of 44 passing attempts for 344 passing yards, two touchdowns to Jordan Addison, and one interception in a 20–17 defeat.[172][173] In Week 2 against the Eagles on Thursday Night Football, Cousins threw for 364 passing yards and four touchdowns, two to T. J. Hockenson, in a 28–34 loss.[174] Against the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 3, Cousins completed 32-of-50 passes for 367 yards, three touchdowns, and a late interception in the end zone that sealed a 28–24 defeat.[175][176] In the following week against the Panthers, Cousins overcame two interceptions, including a 99-yard pick six, and threw two touchdown passes to Justin Jefferson in a 21–13 victory.[177] Against the defending Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs in Week 5, Cousins completed 29 passes of 47 attempts for 284 yards and two touchdowns in a 27–20 loss.[178][179] In Week 6, Cousins went 21 of 31 passes for 181 yards and a 10-yard pass touchdown to Jordan Addison, defeating the Bears 19–13 win.[180] In Week 7 against the 49ers on Monday Night Football, Cousins took no sacks and completed 35 passes out of 45 attempts for 378 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception in a 17–22 victory.[181][182] During the October 29, 2023, game against the Packers in Week 8, Cousins threw two touchdowns before suffering a season-ending torn Achilles injury during the fourth quarter.[183][184] On October 31, 2023, he was placed on the injured reserve list.[185] Without Cousins, the Vikings went 3–6 and missed the playoffs.[186] On March 13, 2024, Cousins signed a four-year, $180 million contract with the Atlanta Falcons.[187] A day after his signing became official, reports began to surface that the Falcons were suspected to have tampered with Cousins, which prompted the league to launch an investigation.[188] On April 25, 2024, the Falcons drafted quarterback Michael Penix Jr. with their first-round selection (eighth overall) in the 2024 NFL draft. The Falcons did not notify Cousins or his agent of the decision until they were on the clock with their pick.[189][190] Cousins made his Falcons debut on September 8 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, completing 16-of-26 passes for 155 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions, including a costly interception late in the fourth quarter as the Falcons were shutout in the second half, losing 18–10.[191] The following week against the Eagles on Monday Night Football, Cousins went 20-of-29 for 241 yards and two touchdowns. With under two minutes left and no timeouts, he mounted a game-winning, 70-yard touchdown drive as the Falcons won 22–21.[192] After averaging just under 220 passing yards through his first four games, Cousins threw for a career-high and a Falcons franchise record 509 yards in Week 5, surpassing the previous record of 503 yards set by Matt Ryan, and completed four touchdown passes in a 36–30 overtime victory against the Buccaneers.[193] In Week 8, Cousins threw for 276 yards and four touchdowns in a 31-26 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, earning NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[194] After throwing three touchdowns with a 144.8 passer rating in a win over the Cowboys to improve to 6–3, Cousins failed to record a passing touchdown in back-to-back losses to the New Orleans Saints and Denver Broncos, a career first.[195][196] After the bye week, Cousins tied his career-high with four interceptions in a 17–13 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers, followed by two more interceptions and his fourth consecutive game without a touchdown in a 42–21 road loss to the Vikings.[197][198] In Week 15, he passed for a season-low 112 yards and an interception against the Las Vegas Raiders but ended his touchdown drought in a 15–9 win that snapped Atlanta's losing streak.[199] The following day, head coach Raheem Morris announced that Penix would replace Cousins as the starting quarterback, beginning in Week 16.[200] Prior to his benching, Cousins led the league with 16 interceptions and was tied for the league-lead in fumbles.[201] Cousins is a practicing Evangelical Christian.[216] He married Julie Hampton on June 28, 2014, in Atlanta, Georgia.[217] As of 2019, Cousins and his wife have two sons, Cooper and Turner.[218] During his time with the Redskins, Cousins earned the nickname \"Captain Kirk\" from the media for his presence as a leader, referencing the Star Trek character.[219] Cousins is a cousin of Major League Baseball pitcher Jake Cousins.[220] He has also supported Compassion International and its \"Fill the Stadium\" initiative.[221] Cousins was recorded on-and-off the field during the 2022 NFL season for a Netflix and NFL Films documentary series, Quarterback, which debuted on Netflix on July 12, 2023.[222][223]",

                "content": "The Montana State Bobcats football program competes in the Big Sky Conference of the NCAA's Division I Football Championship Subdivision for Montana State University. The program began in 1897 and has won three national championships (1956, 1976, and 1984). It is the only college football program in the nation to win national championships on three different levels of competition, NAIA, NCAA Division II, and NCAA Division I-AA (now FCS). Through the 2022 season, the Bobcats had played in 1,049 games with an all-time record of 525–492–32.[3] The first championship came in Montana State's last season in the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference, which moved to NAIA in 1952. The national championship was the first ever for the RMAC and was also the first time the NAIA had a football champion. The Bobcats were members of the RMAC from 1917 to 1956, after being an independent from 1897 to 1916. MSC rejoined the NCAA (College Division) in 1957, and had one of its most successful runs as an independent from 1957 to 1962 with six straight winning seasons, including an 8–2 mark in 1957 and 8–1 in 1958. In 1963, Montana State became a charter member of the Big Sky Conference and has since won two national championships.[4] Montana State has won 21 conference titles, including 16 in the Big Sky Conference and five in the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference. The Bobcats have won conference titles in eight of the past nine decades and have won multiple conference titles in seven of the last eight decades. MSU finished the 1926 season undefeated in RMAC conference games, but was not awarded a conference title. They have qualified for the NCAA playoffs thirteen times, once (1976) as a Division II member and twelve times (1984, 2002, 2003, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2018, 2019, 2021, 2022, and 2023) as a Division I-AA/FCS member. Through the 2023 season, the Bobcats are 18–13–2 in postseason play.[5] Their primary rival are the Montana Grizzlies, whom they meet in the annual Brawl of the Wild, more commonly referred to as the Cat-Griz game by MSU students, alumni and supporters.[6] Before World War II, Montana State football tasted success often, but in small doses. The Bobcats did not record a winning season between 1931 and 1941, MSC's last pre-war squad. The 'Cats were 1–10 in that stretch against Montana, and were shut out for eight consecutive years. In 1946, however, things began to change. Composed of war-hardened veterans, Clyde Carpenter and the Bobcats rolled up a 5–3–1 regular season record, impressive enough to land the team its first-ever bowl bid. The Bobcats tied New Mexico, 13–13. Although it would be seven more seasons until Montana State would again win more than it lost, that season helped chart the course into what would become an unbelievably successful period in Montana State's football history as the Bobcats would take 22 of the next 30 games from 1956 to 1985 from the Grizzlies and would win all three of their national championships during that same span.[citation needed] The 1946 team was special for more than its accomplishments, however. When it reassembled following World War II, its special mission was to carry the Bobcat banner after 14 members of Montana State's previous team, the 1941 squad, were killed during World War II. The only pre-war regular to play in the Harbor Bowl was Bill Zupan, whose brother Al was among those 'Cat gridders making the ultimate sacrifice. Others were Orin Beller, Newell Berg,[7][8] Dana Bradford, John Burke, Bernard Cluzen, William Coey, Karl Fye, John Hall, Joseph McGeever, John Phelan, Richard Roman, Wendell Scabad and Alton Zempel, according to the outstanding centennial history of MSU, \"In the People's Interest\". In 1956, the Bobcats, led by freshman captain and two-way (center and middle linebacker) starter Sonny Holland, won a share of the NAIA title at the Aluminum Bowl in Little Rock, Arkansas, playing to a scoreless tie with the Pumas of St. Joseph's College from Rensselaer, Indiana. The game was nationally aired on CBS television and radio. It was played on a rain-soaked field that thwarted MSU's offense, which had run for an average of 323.1 yards rushing and 31.2 points per game. The championship was the first for the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference and the 1956 Montana State football team is a member of the RMAC Hall of Fame. The 1956 Bobcats of head coach Tony Storti were the fourth, and last, Montana State football team to go undefeated. The game is the only blemish on the record of the team as it finished at 9–0–1.[citation needed] Behind head coach Jim Sweeney in 1964, Montana State won the NCAA Western Regional College Division Championship, which existed from 1964 to 1972, with a 28–7 win over Sacramento State in what was also known as the Camellia Bowl. The NCAA Western Regional was one of four regionals that led up to the selection of the NCAA College Division champion by poll. However, neither MSU nor any of the other regional winners—Northern Iowa (Midwest), Middle Tennessee State (Mideast), or East Carolina (East)—were awarded the national championship. That distinction went in split fashion to Los Angeles State (UPI/Coaches) and Wittenberg (AP). Upon the establishment of Division II in 1973, a full playoff system was introduced to determine the national champion. MSU is one of three Big Sky Conference schools, along with Boise State and North Dakota, to win a Camellia Bowl game. The Bobcats finished the 1964 season at 7–4.[citation needed] Montana State won the 1976 NCAA Division II championship at the Pioneer Bowl in Wichita Falls, Texas, beating the Akron Zips 24–13. The Bobcats were led by head coach Sonny Holland and sophomore quarterback Paul Dennehy. MSU led 17–0 in the third quarter before Akron cut the lead to 17–13. Running back Tom Kostrba scored from seven yards out in the fourth quarter to seal the win.[9] The Bobcats advanced to the championship game with a 17–16 quarterfinal win over the New Hampshire in Bozeman. The extra-point attempt to tie the game with seven minutes remaining missed wide right, and the remainder of the game was scoreless.[10] That was followed by a 10–3 semifinal win in the Grantland Rice Bowl over North Dakota State, after trailing 3–0 at halftime on the road in Fargo.[11] Kostrba ran for 100 yards in both playoff games and Don Ueland ran for 94 in the championship game. Montana State finished the 1976 season with ten consecutive wins and a 12–1 record; the lone loss at Fresno State came in September. Eight years later, the Bobcats defeated Louisiana Tech 19–6 in the Division I-AA Championship Game in Charleston, South Carolina, for their third national championship. Led by second-year head coach Dave Arnold, MSU was seeded third in the twelve-team playoffs, which meant a first-round bye and a home game in the quarterfinals, in which the Bobcats rallied from a 0–14 deficit to eliminate Arkansas State 31–14. In the semifinals, also in Bozeman, Montana State trailed second-seeded Rhode Island 12–20 entering the fourth quarter, then scored twenty unanswered points to win 32–20. MSU took the lead on a 97-yard interception return for a touchdown by safety Joe Roberts Jr. Quarterback Kelly Bradley threw for over 300 yards in each playoff game and had eight touchdown passes in the postseason. Tight end Joe Bignell hauled in 10 passes for 130 yards and two touchdowns in the championship game.[12] After a 2–2 start, the Bobcats won ten straight to end at 12–2 in 1984,[13] which followed a 1–10 season in 1983,[14] and preceded a 2–9 record in 1985. Montana State holds the distinction of being the only college football program with national championships in three levels of college football.[15] The Bobcats of head coach Tony Storti claimed a share of the 1956 NAIA title when it finished in a scoreless tie with St. Joseph's (Indiana). In 1976, Sonny Holland's MSU team downed Akron 24–13 for the NCAA Division II championship, and the Bobcats won the NCAA Division I-AA (FCS) championship in 1984 under Dave Arnold with a 19–6 win over Louisiana Tech.[16][17] In the history of college football, including the NAIA, there have been just 11 quarterbacks that have gone over 10,000 yards passing and 1,000 yards rushing for their career. Two of those quarterbacks were produced by Montana State. Travis Lulay accomplished the feat in 2005 when he finished with 10,746 passing and 1,459 rushing. DeNarius McGhee hit those milestones on consecutive weeks in 2013 when he went over 1,000 rushing against Northern Arizona, then hit 10,000 passing against Weber State. He finished his career with 1,133 yards rushing and 11,203 yards passing.[18] Both quarterbacks began playing their freshman season at Montana State. Lulay started the sixth game of his freshman year against Idaho State. After a 2–4 start, he led the Bobcats to the Big Sky regular season championship and their first trip to the playoffs in 18 years. McGhee started the first game of his frosh season and has only missed two games – both in his senior year. He led MSU to Big Sky titles and the FCS playoffs the first three years of his career. MSU is one of just three schools to have repeat winners of the Buck Buchanan Award, which is given out annually by The Sports Network to the most outstanding defensive player in the Football Championship Subdivision.[citation needed] In 2012 Caleb Schreibeis became the first Bobcat to win the award followed by Brad Daly in 2013. Both players manned the defensive end (Bandit) position for MSU and racked up big numbers playing in defensive line coach Bo Beck's system. The two players took completely different routes to the award as Schreibeis, a walk-on out of Billings West, didn't get on the list until the last week of the season and Daly, a highly touted prospect out of Helena Capital, was on the list all season.[citation needed] On November 17, 2018, at approximately 3:19 in the afternoon at Washington-Grizzly Stadium in Missoula with Montana State clinging to a 29–25 lead after rallying from a 22–0 deficit and rival Montana sitting within one foot of the Bobcats goal line with 14 seconds to play, defensive tackle Tucker Yates of Colstrip, Mont. jarred the ball loose from UM's Adam Eastwood and Grant Collins of Bozeman, Mont. sent the ball rolling into the UM backfield where Derek Marks of Belgrade, Mont. pounced on the ball to seal the win for the Bobcats. MSU's other defensive tackle Chase Benson of Helena, Mont. knocked his man so far into the UM backfield that Eastwood had to alter his course causing him to collide with Yates. Bobcat fans have since referred to the play as The Stuff or The Montana Stuff in reference to the four Montana natives who played key roles in the play. Earlier in the quarter Collins had forced and recovered a fumble in UM territory to set up the go-ahead touchdown. The Bobcats trailed by 15 points in the fourth quarter and outscored the Grizzlies 29–3 after falling behind 22–0. The overall comeback is the greatest in Cat-Griz Game history and the fourth quarter comeback matched the comeback from a 24–9 deficit by the 1968 Bobcats, which ended in a 29–24 win over UM. Montana State has won 22 (five in the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference (per RMAC website); 17 in the Big Sky Conference) conference championships through the 2024 season.[19] † Co-champions ‡ Montana and Montana State tied for the 2011 championship, which Montana subsequently vacated[20] NCAA Division I FCS playoff results (known as \"Division I-AA\" from 1978 through 2005) Montana State is 15–12 all time in the FCS playoffs and has won the national championship once, in 1984. The Brawl of the Wild is the game between MSU and their primary rival, the University of Montana Grizzlies. Both teams play for The Great Divide Trophy. As of 2016, Montana holds a healthy 73–42–5 lead in the series, but the series has been tight since 1956 with UM holding just a 33–32 lead; however, there was a notable losing record in the 1990s where MSU failed to win a single game. The series has three distinct periods. From 1897 to 1916 the teams didn't belong to a conference and at times would play twice per year. Early seasons had seven games or less with one season seeing the Grizzlies play just one game. Four of the five ties in the series came during this era. Montana won 12 games to Montana State's 7. In 1917 Montana State joined the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference and in 1924 Montana joined the Pacific Coast Conference, the predecessor of today's Pac-12. The RMAC included several teams that would become Mountain West members. When MSU joined the RMAC it included Colorado, Colorado State, Utah, Utah State, and Brigham Young. The RMAC would drop down to the small college division of NCAA football in 1939 and remained there until 1952 when it joined the NAIA. UM joined the PCC after spending 22 years as part of the Northwest Intercollegiate Athletic Association with league members Washington, Oregon, Washington State, Oregon State, Idaho and Wittman College in 1924. By then the PCC included Stanford, California, UCLA, USC, Oregon, Oregon State, Washington, Washington State, and Idaho. The Bobcats remained in the RMAC through 1956, while the Grizzlies continued in the PCC through 1949 and joined the Skyline (aka Mountain States) Conference, which also competed in the NCAA University (large) Division, from 1951 to 1961. MSU was a NAIA independent from 1957 to 1962 and UM was an NCAA University Division (large) independent in 1950 and 1962. During this period UM enjoyed a 30–8–1 edge in Cat-Griz games. Both schools entered the Big Sky Conference as charter members in 1963 with Montana holding a 42–15–2 series lead, but the Bobcats winning five of the previous seven. From 1963 to 1985 Montana State enjoyed its most successful period of the Cat-Griz rivalry. MSU won 17 games to just six for UM. Following that Montana started \"The Streak\" when it won 16 straight games from 1986 to 2001. MSU ended the drought by winning three of four, MSU (as of 2022) leads the series 10–9 * after \"The Streak.\" The Big Sky era shows Montana with a 31–28 lead. Since MSU won its first national championship in 1956, the series shows UM with a 33–32 edge. Prior to that UM had a 40–10–5 advantage. The Bobcats play their home games at Bobcat Stadium, located at the south end of campus in Bozeman. The stadium and area around the stadium have been under vast renovations and improvements with approximately $14.3 million invested over the past five years. In 2013, the stadium's parking lots were paved, landscaped, and had lighting installed to enhance the pre-game tailgating experience. During and following the 2011 season, stadium lighting was added and its first night game was in 2012 against Chadron State on Thursday, August 30. MSU renovated the south end zone in 2011, adding 5,277 seats to bring the official seating capacity to 17,777. The Cat-Griz game against Montana in 2022 set a stadium record with an attendance of 22,047. The new end zone seating holds over 7,200 fans. Included in the 2011 upgrades were an 18' x 37' LED video board, two scoreboards, and sound system. In 2008, the natural grass playing surface was replaced with FieldTurf. In the late fall of 2011, Montana State raised funds for stadium lighting in order to extend the hours it can practice and play night games. Seven light standards were erected around the stadium. MSU currently has plans to renovate the east grandstand to include matching sky suites of the west grandstand and erect seating in the north end zone. These additions would increase seating capacity to approximately 24,000. Fund-raising isn't expected to go public until 2015. Prior to the 2011 addition, Bobcat Stadium was renovated in 1997 when the west grandstand was removed and replaced with a new grandstand with luxury sky suites, indoor stadium seating, press box, and club room. The north bleachers were also removed at this time and replaced with locker rooms for visitors, game officials, and an auxiliary locker room for the Bobcats. The name of the stadium was changed from Reno H. Sales Stadium to Bobcat Stadium at this time. The stadium capacity dropped from 15,000 to 12,500 due to the reconfiguration. Reno H. Sales Stadium was erected in 1973 and replaced Gatton Field. Through the 1971 football season, the Bobcats played home games for four decades at Gatton Field. It was located directly south of the Romney Gym, across Grant Street and northeast of the Brick Breeden Fieldhouse, which opened in 1957. The playing field ran east–west and had lighting as far back as the 1940s.[21] It was razed in early 1972 and is the site of the Marga Hosaeus Fitness Center, opened in 1973. Bobcat Stadium is approximately a half mile (0.8 km) due south. The field was named for Cyrus J. Gatton (1894–1918), a former Montana State football player from 1913 to 1916. A native of Iowa who was raised in Bozeman, Gatton enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Service during World War I and was killed while flying for the French on November 4, 1918, just a week before the Armistice. The class of 1917 voted in 1920 that when the school built a new football field it should be named for Cyrus Gatton, and the request was honored ten years later. MSU played its 1972 season at Bozeman High School's Van Winkle Stadium, with expanded temporary seating.[22] Despite the temporary relocation, the Bobcats still won the Big Sky Conference title that season. Montana State has seen 29 players receive First Team All-America recognition, with 22 of those earning consensus All-America status based on being selected to the first team of three or more recognized All-America teams. In 1954, Jim Argeris became the first player selected as a first team All-America. Center Sonny Holland is the only three-time honoree and running back Don Hass the only two-time honoree. MSU had seven first team selections from 2009 to 2012, which is the most of any four-year span in school history. In 2012 quarterback DeNarius McGhee, outside linebacker Jody Owens, and defensive end Caleb Schreibeis were selected to one or more of the various 2012 All-America first teams. McGhee is the first quarterback, Owens is the third linebacker, and Schreibeis the fifth defensive end in MSU history to receive the honor. 2012 marked the second time that MSU has had three All-America selections in one season. The other time it occurred was when 1984's national championship team saw defensive end Mark Fellows, punter Dirk Nelson, and offensive tackle Bill Schmidt selected. In 2013, Brad Daly became the seventh defensive lineman to earn All-America status. Daly joined Bill Kollar, Les Leininger, Mark Fellows, Neal Smith, Dane Fletcher, and Caleb Schreibeis. Daly also joined punter Matthew Peot as the only unanimous All-America selections in school history. (*)unanimous selection Sonny Holland is considered the greatest Bobcat football player in school history. The Butte native joined the program in 1956, and starting at center as a true freshman, helped lead Montana State to its first national title when it tied St. Joseph's in the first NAIA championship game 0–0. He would earn first team All-America honors in 1957, 1958 and 1959 and is the only MSU player to do so three times. As a player, his teams never lost to rival Montana beating the Grizzlies 33–14, 22–13, 20–6, and 40–6, with Holland manning both the center and middle linebacker positions in most of those games. Holland returned to MSU as an assistant coach and became the head coach in 1971. After a disappointing 2–7–1 first season that included his only loss to Montana as a player or head coach, he went on to finish .500 or better in each of the next six years, and set a school record with 47 wins. After a humiliating 30–0 loss to UM in 1971, Holland's teams rattled off wins of 21–3, 33–7, 43–29, 20–3, 21–12, and 24–19 against their rivals. The highlight of his coaching career was the 1976 team, which won the NCAA Division II national championship with a 24–13 victory over the Akron Zips. In 11 games against Montana as a player and head coach Holland went 10–1 outscoring the Grizzlies 277–142. Holland's No. 52 football jersey is one of four retired by Montana State University. A running back from 1964 to 1967 nicknamed the Iron Tumbleweed, Don Hass is one of only two players in MSU history to receive first team All-America status twice, and is the only MSU player to be named a first team NCAA All-America twice. Hass set the game (298), season (1,460), and career (2,954) rushing records for the Bobcats during his four years. His 298 yards in a single game in 1966 against Weber State is still the top single game performance in school history. While that game stands out, his best performances were against the Grizzlies. He led them to wins in 1965 and 1966. In 1965, he ran for 100 yards for the first time in his career, and finished with 129 yards in a 24–7 win. In 1966 he ran for 142 yards in a 38–0 rout in Missoula. He ran for a Cat-Griz record 209 yards against Montana in 1967, leading the Bobcats to a 14–8 win. All told he had 480 yards rushing in three games against Montana, all wins. The Montana State football jersey with number 21 is retired in his honor and hangs inside Bobcat Stadium. Dennis Erickson was a MSU quarterback from 1966 to 1968. He was also a head coach in college and professional football from 1982 to 2011. In 1968, Erickson engineered the greatest comeback, in what is considered by many as the most exciting game in the Cat-Griz series. In all, 34 points were scored in the final quarter. Erickson, flanker Ron Bain, and running back Paul Schafer led the comeback, as the Bobcats clinched a tie for the Big Sky championship—their third straight. Bain's brother, Doug of the Grizzlies, gave Montana a 17–9 lead early in the quarter on a pass from Ray Brum. After another UM touchdown made the score 24–9 with just over 10 minutes to go it looked as if the Grizzlies would win going away, but the Bobcats weren't done. Schaefer scored on a short run with 8:15 to play and Erickson hit Bain for a touchdown with five minutes left cutting the lead to two at 24–22. The Grizzlies appeared to have the winning drive stopped at the MSU 32, but a facemask penalty gave the Cats new life on the 17. Scoring 20 points in the last nine minutes, Montana State won 29–24 when Schafer, who had 58 carries for 234 yards in the game, dove into the end zone with 12 seconds left. After Schafer's go-ahead touchdown with 12 seconds to play, the Grizzlies nearly spoiled things for MSU. After a touchback on the kickoff, UM takes over at the 20 with speedy receiver Ron Baines at quarterback. He gains 15, and another 15 are tacked on by an unnecessary roughness penalty to stop the clock with three seconds to go. Baines then makes a circus run of 37 yards from midfield before he's dragged down at the MSU 13 after time expires. Bobcat QB Dennis Erickson was the difference. \"Erickson killed us,\" UM head coach Jack Swarthout said. Erickson led Montana State to three straight (1966, 1967, 1968) Big Sky Conference championships, and a spot in the 1966 College Division Western Regional (Camellia Bowl), where the Bobcats lost to the San Diego State Aztecs 28–7. He went on to coach the Miami Hurricanes to two NCAA Division I-A national championships. He also had college head coaching stints with the Idaho Vandals, Wyoming Cowboys, Washington State Cougars, Oregon State Beavers and Arizona State Sun Devils. Professionally, he was the head coach of the NFL's Seattle Seahawks and San Francisco 49ers. One Montana State Bobcat has been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame: Jan Stenerud. After coming to MSU from Norway on a ski jumping scholarship, Stenerud starred on the varsity team, having a then-NCAA record 59-yard field goal against rival Montana in 1965. Stenerud scored 82 points as a senior in 1965. He was drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in the third round of the AFL's 1966 draft. In 1970, he kicked a then-Super Bowl record 48-yard field goal in Kansas City's 23–7 Super Bowl IV win. He would later go on to play for the Green Bay Packers and Minnesota Vikings earning seven All-Pro and three All-AFL selections, and four trips to the Pro Bowl in his 19 seasons as a professional. He was inducted in 1991 as the first pure kicker in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Stenerud's name is in the Kansas City Chiefs' ring of honor, and he is one of just four MSU players to have his number, \"78\" retired. Six Montana State graduates have played in a Super Bowl. The most recent is Mike Person. Dane Fletcher, who was a linebacker for the New England Patriots, in Super Bowl XLVI. The first was Stenerud in Super Bowl IV, followed by Ron East, who played defensive tackle the following year in Super Bowl V for the Dallas Cowboys. Sam McCullum was a wide receiver for the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl IX against the Oakland Raiders. Running back Tony Boddie played in Super Bowl XXII for the Denver Broncos. Travis Jonsen earned a Super Bowl ring as a practice squad player for Tampa Bay. In 2011, quarterback Travis Lulay was named the Most Outstanding Player in the Canadian Football League and led the British Columbia Lions to the Grey Cup title, garnering the game's Most Valuable Player award in the 34–23 win over Winnipeg. The Lions started the season 0–5 before winning 13 of their last 15 games to win the championship. Lulay threw for a league-high 32 touchdowns and passed for 4,815 yards to finish with the second best passer rating in the CFL. He also ran for 391 yards (8.3 per carry), which was good for 12th in the CFL and was the most by a quarterback. Lulay was the quarterback at MSU from 2002 to 2005 leading the Bobcats to three Big Sky Conference titles and two NCAA Division I-AA playoff appearances. All three Big Sky Conference championships were taken in the last game of the season with wins over rival Montana. As a true freshman, Lulay engineered MSU's 10–7 win over the Grizzlies in Missoula, ending UM's 16-game winning streak over the Bobcats, and was named the Big Sky Conference's Newcomer of the Year. Lulay led Montana State in rushing his senior year with 611 yards. He left with school records for career passing yards (10,746–11th in NCAA Division I-AA history), single-season total offense, and total offense in a career. He graduated with a 3.91 GPA. He played briefly for the Seattle Seahawks and New Orleans Saints of the NFL and also played in the NFL Europa for two seasons. In 1974 Kollar became the first small college (non-FBS) player to win the Senior Bowl MVP, and is one of only two (Portland State's Neil Lomax being the other) small college players to win the award in that game's history. Kollar became one of just four Big Sky Conference players ever selected as an NFL first round draft choice when he was taken by the Cincinnati Bengals in 1974. He went on to play eight seasons in the NFL, including five with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He has been an NFL defensive line coach since 1990 and currently coaches in that capacity for the Denver Broncos. He is a member of the Senior Bowl and MSU Hall of Fames, and his number \"77\" is one of only four football numbers retired by MSU. Don Haas, Holland and Stenerud are the others. Following the completion of the 2012 NCAA FCS regular season, Schreibeis was named the winner of Buck Buchanan Award given annually by The Sports Network to the most outstanding defensive player in the FCS. It was the first such distinction for a Montana State player. He was also a consensus All-America in 2012, the 20th Bobcat to attain that status. Schreibeis came to Montana State as a walk-on in 2008, and after red-shirting for one season, eventually worked his way into a starting position for one game as a sophomore in 2010. He became a full-time starter in 2011 and was selected as an honorable mention to the All-Big Sky team. The 2012 season was a breakout campaign for Schreibeis. In 10 regular-season games, the team captain collected 51 tackles and led the Big Sky with 12 sacks. He ranked first on his team in tackles for loss (14.5), quarterback hurries (seven) and forced fumbles (seven), which was also the top mark in the nation. The Bobcats also won their third straight Big Sky Conference title that season. Brad Daly garnered the 2013 Buck Buchanan Award and the FCS Athletics Directors Association Award, and is perhaps the best pure pass rusher in MSU history. Along with the two defensive player of the year awards, he was also a finalist for the Ted Hendricks Award, given to the best defensive end in all divisions of college football. He finished fifth in the final voting. He made an immediate impact as a true-freshman, despite playing sparingly, as he recorded two sacks and blocked two kicks, leaving observers to speculate that he would have a great career. Daly left football after that season, only to return a year later with a renewed vigor. In his sophomore year, he proved his worth by leading the Big Sky Conference with 12.5 sacks as a situational pass rusher. As a junior he became a full-time defensive end, but suffered a severely sprained ankle, and dropped to just 5.5 sacks. A year later he bounced back, despite nagging injuries, to lead the nation in sacks with 14 sacks and 20.5 tackles for loss. For his career Daly finished with 34 sacks. He was also a unanimous first team All-America selection and the Big Sky Conference defensive player of the year as a senior. He was voted a team captain prior to his senior season, joining his father J and brother Bobby as MSU team captains and All-Americans. Bobby Daly was sixth in the 2007 Buck Buchanan Award voting. Two Montana State Bobcats have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame; Jan Stenerud. After coming to MSU from Norway on a ski jumping scholarship, Stenerud starred on the varsity team with a then-NCAA record 59-yard field goal against rival Montana and 82 points scored as a senior in 1965. He was drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in the third round of the AFL's 1966 draft. Stenerud scored 11 points, including a then-Super Bowl record 48-yard field goal, in Kansas City's 23–7 Super Bowl IV win in 1970. He would later go on to play for the Green Bay Packers and Minnesota Vikings earning four trips to the Pro Bowl in his 19 seasons as a professional. He was inducted in 1991 and is one of only two pure kickers in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the other being Morten Andersen. Stenerud's name is in the Kansas City Chiefs' ring of honor and he is one of just four MSU players to have his number \"78\" retired. William Wallace \"Bill\" Kollar. Wilson was elected to the Canadian Football Hall of Fame on September 20, 1997, following a long career as an offensive lineman with the British Columbia Lions. The guard and center was awarded All-Western All-Star and All-Canadian All-Star honors for seven years, 1975–81. He was voted the Schenley Most Outstanding Offensive Lineman in 1977. He played in two Grey Cup games (1983 and 1985), and was a key member of B.C.'s 1985 championship team. Wylie was elected to the Canadian Football Hall of Fame on May 24, 1980. The former Bobcat All-America was a standout defensive back and kick return specialist for nine years with Calgary. He played for the Calgary Stampeders from 1956 to 1964, and for five straight years was an All-Western All-Star and twice was an All-Canadian All-Star. Announced schedules as of December 6, 2024.[31]",

                "content": "Derrick Lamar Henry Jr.[1][2] (born January 4, 1994)[1] is an American professional football running back for the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League (NFL). Nicknamed \"King Henry\",[3][4] he is known for his imposing style of play and larger build than the average running back. Born and raised in Yulee, Florida, Henry set the national high school football record for career rushing yards with the Yulee Hornets. He played college football for the Alabama Crimson Tide, where during his junior season, he broke Herschel Walker's single-season college rushing yards record in the Southeastern Conference (SEC), won the 2015 Heisman Trophy, the Doak Walker Award, the Maxwell Award, and the Walter Camp Award, and was a key part of the 2015 Alabama Crimson Tide football team that won the 2016 College Football Playoff National Championship. Henry was selected by the Tennessee Titans in the second round of the 2016 NFL draft, where he was a four-time Pro Bowl selection. A backup for most of his first two seasons in the league, Henry emerged as the Titans' feature back near the end of the 2018 season. He led the NFL in rushing yards for the 2019 season, as well as rushing touchdowns (tied with Green Bay Packers running back Aaron Jones). In 2020, Henry again led the league in rushing yards and touchdowns and became the eighth player in NFL history to rush for over 2,000 yards in a single season, and the second Tennessee Titan to do so, after Chris Johnson achieved it in 2009. Henry won the 2020 Associated Press NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award. After missing more than half of the 2021 season to injury, he made his third and fourth Pro Bowl appearances in the subsequent two seasons. After eight seasons with Tennessee, Henry signed with the Ravens in 2024. Derrick Lamar Henry Jr. was born in Yulee, Florida, to Stacy Veal and Derrick Henry Sr., aged 15 and 16 respectively.[5] Henry's father was absent for much of his childhood, having been arrested 20 times for various crimes including drug and prostitution-related offenses, and was consequently in and out of prison and had trouble maintaining employment. His mother became a hemodialysis technician. Henry was raised primarily by his grandmother, Gladys, who nicknamed him \"Shocka\", as his birth shocked the whole family, given his parents' young ages. He developed a close relationship to his grandmother, whom he cites as very influential in his upbringing.[6][7] Henry attended Yulee High School, where he was a three-sport star in football, basketball, and track. He played as a running back for the Yulee Hornets football team.[8] He ran for 2,465 yards and 26 touchdowns as a freshman in 2009. He was named a first-team All-Coast selection at running back in 2010 after rushing for 2,788 yards and 38 touchdowns while averaging 8.9 yards per attempt. He rushed for 2,610 yards and 34 scores as a junior in 2011 to earn first-team All-Coast honors from the Florida Times-Union. He set the Florida high school record with a 510-yard performance against Jacksonville Jackson (a record he held until 2021[9]) and averaged 9.2 yards per carry and 327.8 yards per game as a senior, finishing the season with a state-record 4,261 yards and 55 touchdowns.[10] He finished his high school football career with 12,124 career rushing yards, which broke Ken Hall's career record.[11][12] During this time, Henry began receiving the nickname \"King Henry\" by stadium crowds and local television news reports as he began aiming to break the national high school rushing title.[13] He also rushed for 153 career touchdowns. His career touchdown totals rank fifth all-time. In four years at Yulee he averaged more than 250 yards a game and never rushed for fewer than 100 yards in a game.[14] He played for the East squad in the 2013 U.S. Army All-American Bowl, where he rushed for 53 yards with a touchdown and a two-point conversion.[15][16] As a track & field athlete, Henry competed as a sprinter at Yulee from 2010 to 2011.

He graduated on May 4, 2018.[25] That same day, he published an article in The Players' Tribune thanking his late grandmother for the inspiration to continue pursuing his degree.[25][26] As a true freshman in 2013, Henry rushed for 382 yards on 36 carries with three touchdowns in a backfield largely dominated by T. J. Yeldon and Kenyan Drake.[27][28] On October 19, against Arkansas, he had 111 rushing yards and his first collegiate rushing touchdown in the 52–0 victory.[29] During the 2014 Sugar Bowl, he rushed for 100 yards and a touchdown on eight carries and had a 61-yard touchdown reception in the 45–31 loss to the Oklahoma Sooners.[30][31] In that game, Spanish-language broadcaster Pablo Viruega on ESPN Deportes nicknamed him \"El Tractorcito\" (The Little Tractor) due to his long stride and powerful gait. The nickname became a popular internet meme.[32] In the 2014 season, Henry and Yeldon split a majority of the work in the backfield.[33] In the season opener against West Virginia, he had 113 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown in the 33–23 victory in the Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game.[34] On September 20, against Florida, he had 111 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown in the 42–21 victory.[35] On October 18 against Texas A&M, he had 70 rushing yards, one rushing touchdown, and a 41-yard receiving touchdown in the 59–0 victory.[36] On November 22, against Western Carolina, he had 92 rushing yards, two rushing touchdowns, and a nine-yard receiving touchdown in the 48–14 victory.[37] In the annual rivalry game against Auburn, he had 72 rushing yards and a touchdown in the high-scoring 55–44 installment of the rivalry.[38] In the SEC Championship against Missouri, he had 141 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in the 42–13 victory.[39] Alabama qualified for the College Football Playoff and faced off against Ohio State in the National Semifinals in the Sugar Bowl.[40] Henry had 95 rushing yards, one rushing touchdown, and two receptions for 54 yards as Alabama fell 42–35 to the Buckeyes.[41] In his sophomore year, Henry rushed for 990 yards on 172 carries with 11 touchdowns.[42] After Yeldon left for the NFL, Henry took over as the starting running back as a junior in 2015. In the season opener against Wisconsin, he had 147 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns in the 35–17 victory.[43] In the next game, against Middle Tennessee State, he had 96 rushing yards and another game with three rushing touchdowns in the 37–10 victory.[44] In the next game against Ole Miss, he had 127 rushing yards, one rushing touchdown, and five receptions for 39 yards in Alabama's only loss of the season, a 43–37 decision.[45] After rushing for 52 yards against Louisiana–Monroe, he had 148 rushing yards and a touchdown in a 38–10 victory over previously undefeated Georgia.[46][47] On October 10, he rushed for 95 yards and a touchdown against Arkansas in a 27–14 victory.[48] After the victory over the Razorbacks, he went on an impressive stretch of performances. On October 17, against Texas A&M, he had 236 rushing yards, two rushing touchdowns, and an 18-yard reception in a 41–23 victory.[49] In the next game, a narrow 19–14 victory over Tennessee, he had 143 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns.[50] In the following game, a much-anticipated matchup with fellow Heisman contender Leonard Fournette of LSU, he had 210 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns in the 30–16 victory over the previously undefeated team.[51][52] In the next game, against Mississippi State, he had 204 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in the 31–6 victory.[53] In the next game, against Charleston Southern, he had 68 rushing yards and two more rushing touchdowns in a limited role in the 56–6 victory.[54] In the Iron Bowl against Auburn, he had 271 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown on 46 carries in the 29–13 victory.[55] In the SEC Championship against Florida, he had 44 carries for 189 yards and a touchdown in the 29–15 victory.[56] Alabama qualified for the College Football Playoff and faced off against Michigan State in the National Semifinals.[57] In the 38–0 victory over the Spartans in the Cotton Bowl, he had 75 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns.[58] During Alabama's 45–40 victory over Clemson in the 2016 College Football Playoff National Championship, he rushed for 158 yards on 36 carries with three touchdowns.[59] During the game, he also broke Shaun Alexander's record for most career rushing yards in Alabama history.[60] Playing in all 15 games, he rushed for SEC records 2,219 yards and 28 touchdowns on 395 carries. In addition, he scored at least one touchdown in each game.[61][62][63] He led the NCAA in rushing attempts, rushing yards, rushing touchdowns, and points scored.[64] Henry won the Heisman Trophy, beating out finalists Christian McCaffrey and Deshaun Watson.[65] He won numerous other awards including the Doak Walker Award, Walter Camp Award, and Maxwell Award.[66] Henry declared for the 2016 NFL Draft after his junior season.[25] Coming out of Alabama, Henry was projected by the majority of analysts to be either drafted in the late first or second round. Scouts regarded his main assets to be his large frame, violent running, ability to break tackles with ease, speed, long strides, superior conditioning, and consistent play. The main concerns were about the wear and tear his body took as a workhorse at Alabama, his slow acceleration, average foot quickness, below-average catching ability, narrow based running style, sluggish cutbacks, and running tall.[67] Henry was drafted by the Tennessee Titans in the second round (45th overall) of the 2016 NFL draft.[70] He was the second running back taken that year, after #4 Ezekiel Elliott.[71] He was reunited with his former fullback at Alabama Jalston Fowler.[72] On May 9, 2016, the Titans signed Henry to a four-year, $5.40 million contract with $3.30 million guaranteed and a signing bonus of $2.13 million.[73] Henry began his rookie season as the backup running back to veteran DeMarco Murray. He wore the No. 2 jersey throughout training camp and preseason and donned the No. 22 once running back Dexter McCluster was cut on September 2, 2016.[74] Henry made his NFL debut and earned his first NFL start in the Titans' season-opening loss to the Minnesota Vikings. He finished the game with five carries for three yards and two receptions for 41 yards.[75] During Week 8, Henry scored his first NFL touchdown on a 6-yard rush in a 36–22 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars. He finished the game with 16 carries for a then career-high 60 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown and four catches for 37 yards.[76] On December 18, 2016, he had nine rushing attempts for 58 rushing yards and a season-high two rushing touchdowns in a 19–17 road victory over the Kansas City Chiefs.[77] During the season finale against the Houston Texans, he ran for a then-career-high 65 rushing yards on 15 carries and scored a touchdown in the 24–17 victory.[78] Henry finished his rookie season with 110 carries for 490 yards (both sixth among NFL rookies in 2016) and five touchdowns in 15 games and two starts.[79] He also caught 13 passes for 137 yards.[80] For most of the 2017 season, Henry split carries with DeMarco Murray and run-oriented quarterback Marcus Mariota. During Week 2, Henry ran for 92 yards and a touchdown on 14 carries in a 37–16 road victory against the Jaguars.[81] On October 16, 2017, on Monday Night Football, Henry ran for a then career-best 131 yards on 19 carries, including a 72-yard touchdown late in the fourth quarter of the 36–22 victory over the Indianapolis Colts. In addition, he had a 14-yard reception in the victory.[82] During Week 13, Henry ran for 109 yards on 11 carries and beat his longest rush of the year with a 75-yard rushing touchdown late in the fourth quarter of the 24–13 victory over the Texans.[83] In the regular season finale against the Jaguars, Henry caught his first receiving touchdown on a 66-yard reception from Marcus Mariota in the 15–10 victory.[84] The Titans finished second in the AFC South with a 9–7 record and made the playoffs as a Wild Card team.[85][86] In the Wild Card Round, the Titans played the Chiefs. Because DeMarco Murray was out with a knee injury, Henry got the start.[87] In a 22–21 road victory, Henry had the best performance of his career up to that point, rushing for 156 yards and a touchdown on 23 carries and catching two passes for 35 yards.[88] His 191 yards-from-scrimmage was a franchise record. In the Divisional Round against the New England Patriots, Henry had 28 rushing yards and 21 receiving yards in the 35–14 road loss.[89] Henry finished the regular season with 176 carries for 744 rushing yards and five touchdowns in 15 games and two starts. He also caught 11 passes for 136 yards and a touchdown. In the postseason, Henry ran for 184 yards and a touchdown on 35 carries and caught five passes for 56 yards.[90] During the 2018 offseason, Matt LaFleur was hired as the Titans' new offensive coordinator and the team also acquired running back Dion Lewis.[91] Lewis's pass-catching ability was seen as a fit for LaFleur's offensive scheme, which often employed running backs to catch passes out of the backfield, and leading to success with Todd Gurley in the previous season as offensive coordinator with the Rams.[92] This led to speculation that LaFleur would favor Lewis over Henry.[93] Henry ended up splitting carries with Lewis and run-oriented quarterback Marcus Mariota for most of the 2018 season. During Week 2, Henry recorded an eight-yard pass completion, the first of his career, to wide receiver Taywan Taylor in the Titans' 20–17 victory over the Texans.[94] He also had 18 carries in that game and the next against the Jaguars, but was used much less frequently through the middle of the season. From Weeks 4–13, Henry averaged nine carries for only 37 yards per game, and never rushed for over 60 yards.[80] This all changed in Week 14 against the Jaguars. In the second quarter, Henry had a 99-yard touchdown run, fending off three tacklers, tying him with Tony Dorsett for the longest NFL touchdown run. He finished the game with four rushing touchdowns and 238 rushing yards on 17 carries, breaking Chris Johnson's franchise record of 228 yards in 2009.[95][96][97] He also became the ninth player in NFL history to record a 200+ yard and 4+ touchdown game, and the first to do so on fewer than 22 carries.[98] His 238 rushing yards were the most by any player for a single game for the 2018 season.[99] Henry was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week due to his spectacular performance.[100] During Week 15, the Titans went on the road to face the New York Giants. In a cold and rainy game, Henry led the NFL in rushing for the second consecutive week with 170 yards and two touchdowns on a career-high 33 carries, along with a one-yard reception and six-yard pass completion in the 17–0 shutout.[101] In Weeks 16 and 17, he combined for 177 rushing yards and a touchdown in the two games against the Washington Redskins and Colts.[102][103] He was later named the AFC Offensive Player of the Month for December.[104] Henry finished the 2018 season with 1,059 rushing yards and 12 touchdowns along with 15 receptions for 99 yards.[105] After the season, he was ranked 99th on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2019.[106] In the 2019 season opener against the Cleveland Browns, Henry rushed 19 times for 84 yards and a touchdown. He also caught one pass for a 75-yard touchdown as the Titans won on the road 43–13.[107] During Week 2 against the Colts, he rushed 15 times for 81 yards and a touchdown as the Titans narrowly lost 19–17.[108] Two weeks later against the Atlanta Falcons, Henry had his first 100-yard game of the season when he rushed for 100 yards on 27 carries in a 24–10 road victory.[109] In the next game against the Buffalo Bills, he rushed for 78 yards and a touchdown as the Titans lost by a score of 14–7.[110] After a season-low 28 yards in a Week 6 shutout loss to the Denver Broncos, Henry sank to 12th in the league in rushing, over 200 yards behind the league leaders he would eventually catch.[111] Henry responded with 90 rushing yards and a touchdown in a 23–20 victory against the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 7.[112] During Week 9 against the Carolina Panthers, Henry rushed 13 times for 63 yards and a touchdown and caught three passes for 36 yards and a touchdown in the 30–20 road loss.[113] In the next game against the Chiefs, he finished with 188 rushing yards and two touchdowns as the Titans narrowly won 35–32.[114] Henry won the FedEx Ground Player of the Week for his efforts.[115] During a Jaguars rematch in Week 12 after a Week 11 bye, Henry had a 74-yard rushing touchdown in the third quarter. Overall, he finished the 42–20 victory with 159 rushing yards and two touchdowns along with one reception for 16 yards.[116] In the next game, a rematch against the Colts, he rushed 26 times for 149 yards and a touchdown in the 31–17 road victory.[117] During Week 14 against the Oakland Raiders, Henry ran for 103 yards and two touchdowns in the 42–21 road victory.[118] During the regular-season finale against the Texans, Henry finished with 211 rushing yards and three touchdowns as the Titans won 35–14 and made it to the playoffs as a Wild Card team. During the game, Henry narrowly won the 2019 rushing title over Nick Chubb of the Cleveland Browns, with the winning rush being a 53-yard touchdown run.[119] This was Henry's first career rushing crown and the first Titan to win it since Chris Johnson in 2009.[120] Henry finished the regular season setting career-highs in carries with 303, rushing yards with 1,540, and rushing touchdowns with 16, which all led the league, despite only playing in 15 games, missing the Week 16 game against the New Orleans Saints due to a hamstring injury.[121] He also set career-highs in receptions with 16, receiving yards with 206, and receiving touchdowns with two.[122] On December 17, 2019, he was selected to his first Pro Bowl.[123] On January 3, 2020, he was named to the second-team All-Pro at both the running back and flex position, both behind Christian McCaffrey.[124] He was ranked 10th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2020.[125] With the Titans finishing the season 9–7, the team narrowly clinched a wild card spot for the #6 seed. In the Wild Card Round against the defending Super Bowl champion Patriots, which was played on his 26th birthday, Henry rushed for over 100 yards and a touchdown in the first half, finishing with 182 yards (the most ever against a Bill Belichick-led team, and the third most ever in a postseason road game) and a 22-yard reception in the 20–13 road victory. Henry became the first rushing champion with a 100-yard playoff game since Terrell Davis in 1998, the first to win a playoff game since LaDainian Tomlinson in 2007, and the second Titan with multiple post-season 100+ rushing games.[126] He also broke his own franchise record for most yards-from-scrimmage with 204.[127] During the Divisional Round against the Baltimore Ravens, Henry rushed 30 times for 195 yards and threw a three-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Corey Davis in the 28–12 road victory.[128] He became the second player in NFL history with three postseason games with at least 150 rushing yards, joining Terrell Davis, who had four. In addition, he became the only player with at least 175 rushing yards in consecutive games. Davis is the only other with two such games in a career.[129] In the AFC Championship against the Chiefs, Henry was mostly held in check. During the game, he rushed 19 times for 69 yards and a touchdown in the 35–24 road loss.[130] On March 16, 2020, the Titans placed the franchise tag on Henry.[131] He signed the tag on April 2, 2020.[132] Henry signed a new four-year $50 million contract with the team on July 15, 2020.[133] Despite leading the league in rushing yards for most of the first four weeks of the 2020 season, Henry was limited to no more than 3.7 yards per carry for all but one of them. These struggles ended in the week 6 game against the Texans, Henry finished with 212 rushing yards, 52 receiving yards, and two touchdowns (including a 94-yard rushing touchdown). In overtime, he finished the game with a five-yard touchdown to end the game as the Titans won 42–36.[134] Henry was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance in Week 6.[135] He was also named AFC Offensive Player of the Month for October after racking up 399 scrimmage yards with 344 yards rushing and five touchdowns.[136] During a Week 8 31–20 road loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, he ran for 112 yards and a touchdown.[137] In Week 11 against the Ravens, Henry had 133 rushing yards and the game-winning touchdown in overtime to defeat the Ravens on the road 30–24.[138][139] In a 45–26 road victory against the Colts in Week 12, Henry had 27 carries for 178 rushing yards and three touchdowns.[140] In Week 14 against the Jaguars, Henry rushed 26 times for 215 yards and two touchdowns during the 31–10 victory.[141] In Week 15 against the Detroit Lions, Henry rushed for 147 yards and a touchdown during the 46–25 win.[142] In Week 17 against the Houston Texans, Henry rushed for a career-high 250 rushing yards and two touchdowns during the 41–38 road victory.[143] Henry was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance.[144] During the game, Henry became the eighth running back in NFL history to surpass 2,000 rushing yards.[145] This also made him the only player to have 2,000 yard rushing seasons in high school, college, and the NFL.[146] In addition to his 2,027 rushing yards, Henry established career highs in carries (378), yards-per-carry (5.4) and rushing touchdowns (17). He was named the 2020 Offensive Player of the Year at the 10th Annual NFL Honors.[147] He was ranked fourth by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2021.[148] In the Wild Card Round of the playoffs against the Ravens, Henry was held without a single first down. He was limited to 40 yards on 18 carries (2.2 yards-per-carry) and three receptions for 11 yards during the 20–13 loss.[149] Henry began the season slow, held to only 58 rushing yards as the Titans lost to the Arizona Cardinals 38–13.[150] During Week 2 against the Seattle Seahawks, Henry finished with 182 rushing yards, 55 receiving yards, and three rushing touchdowns as the Titans won 33–30 in overtime. He earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week for Week 2.[151] In Week 6, Henry ran for 143 yards and three touchdowns in a 34–31 win over the Bills, earning his second AFC Offensive Player of the Week honor of the year.[152] During a Week 8 win against the Colts, Henry suffered a Jones fracture that would end up sidelining him for the remainder of the regular season.[153] He was placed on injured reserve on November 1. Prior to his injury, Henry was leading the league in carries, rushing yards and rushing touchdowns, and was on pace to break the NFL rushing record.[154] Henry was named the Titans' nominee for the 2021 Walter Payton Man of the Year Award.[155] Henry was activated off injured reserve on January 21, 2022, for the team's Divisional Round game against the Bengals.[156] In his return, Henry had 20 carries for 62 yards along with a rushing touchdown in the Titans' 19–16 loss.[157] He was ranked 12th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2022.[158] Prior to the 2022 season on September 1, 2022, Henry was given a raise by the Titans, receiving a $2 million bump for the year.[159] In Week 3, against the Las Vegas Raiders, Henry had 143 scrimmage yards and a rushing touchdown in the 24–22 victory.[160] In the following game, against the Colts, Henry had 22 carries for 114 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown in the 24–17 victory.[161] One week later, he had 28 carries for 102 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in a 21–17 victory over the Washington Commanders.[162] In Week 7, Henry had 30 carries for 128 rushing yards in a 19–10 victory over the Colts.[163] In Week 8, Henry had 32 carries for 219 yards and two touchdowns in a 17–10 win over the Texans, earning AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[164] He was named AFC Offensive Player of the Month for October.[165] In Week 9, against the Chiefs, Henry had 17 carries for 115 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in the 20–17 overtime loss.[166] In Week 11, against the Green Bay Packers, Henry had 132 scrimmage yards and one rushing touchdown.

He also had 28 receptions for 214 receiving yards.[185] On March 12, 2024, Henry signed with the Baltimore Ravens on a two-year, $16 million deal worth up to $20 million which also included $9 million fully guaranteed in the first year.[186] In Week 3, Henry had 151 rushing yards on 25 attempts and two touchdowns in a 28–25 win against the Cowboys.[187] In Week 4 against the Bills, Henry had 199 rushing yards and a touchdown on 24 carries with an 87-yard rushing score on the Ravens’ first offensive play, which was the longest run in franchise history. He also had 10 receiving yards and a touchdown on three receptions. The Ravens won 35–10.[188] For his performance in Week 4, Henry was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[189] In Week 5 against the Bengals, Henry scored his 100th overall career touchdown, while also reaching the mark of 10,000 career rushing yards later in the game, becoming the fifth player in NFL history to achieve the feat. The Ravens won in overtime, 41–38.[190] In Week 6, Henry rushed for 132 yards and two touchdowns in a 30-23 win over the Washington Commanders, earning AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[191] Standing at 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) tall and weighing 247 pounds (112 kg), Henry is much larger than most running backs and has a frame comparable to that of a linebacker.[192] Henry is a \"power back\", using his large size and strength to overpower defenders, stiff arm and break tackles. In 2020, he accumulated 1,073 yards after contact, over 300 yards more than any running back in the league, and led the league in broken tackles with 34.[193] He couples that strength and size with surprising speed relative to his size.[194] Henry is adept at using the stiff-arm to repel defenders, with it being described as his \"signature\".[195][196] As a power back, his playing style contrasts with those of smaller, so-called \"scat backs\", who have greater elusiveness due to their faster ability to change directions. Henry is not usually used as a pass catcher, but he makes up for his lack of productiveness as a pass-catcher using his dominance as a pure runner.[193] Observers have also noted that Henry has a tendency to get better, particularly in yards per carry, in the later stages of a game, as his strength and toughness wears down opponents.[197] Henry's successful running game has also permitted the offense success with play-action.[198] In 2018, Henry fulfilled a promise to his grandmother by graduating from Alabama with a bachelor's degree in communications.[209] In November 2019, Henry's hometown of Yulee, Florida, celebrated him with a welcome sign in his honor. Fundraising for the sign came from local residents and businesses.[210] Henry has been in a relationship with Adrianna Rivas since 2016. They have two daughters.[211][212] Italics denotes active player",

                "content": "The Boise State Broncos football program represents Boise State University in college football and competes in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) as a member of the Mountain West Conference. The Broncos play their home games on campus at Albertsons Stadium in Boise, Idaho, and their head coach is Spencer Danielson. Established in 1933, The Broncos have achieved numerous on-field successes, including 22 conference championships, 6 division titles in the Mountain West Mountain Division, and 2 national championships, one in junior college in 1958 and the other in Div 1 FCS in 1980. They have had 7 undefeated seasons (1947, 1948, 1949, 1950, 1958, 2006, and 2009), and 9 playoff appearances, including a first round bye as the #3 seed in the College Football Playoff in 2024. The program has the longest current streak of winning seasons in college football (FBS Level) with 27 and is 3–0 in the Fiesta Bowl with wins in 2007, 2010, and 2014. As of the end of the 2023 season, the Broncos' all-time winning percentage of .725 is the sixth highest among NCAA FBS football teams, while their 491 total wins ranks 105th.[3] Originally a junior college, Boise State first fielded a football team in 1933 under head coach Dusty Kline.[4] That team compiled a record of 1–2–1 (.375).[4][5] Kline was succeeded by Max Eiden.[5] Under Eiden, the Broncos posted a record of 11–17–1 (.397) from 1934 to 1937.[5] Eiden was succeeded by Harry Jacoby, who coached the team from 1938 to the middle of the 1941 season before being called into Army service. The remainder of the 1941 season was coached by George \"Stub\" Allison, who posted a record of 2–1 (.667).[5] The Broncos did not compete in intramural football from 1942 to 1945 due to having a reduced male student population during World War II.[5] Following the war, Jacoby would return to coach the Broncos for one more season in 1946, posting a final record of 14–15–2 (.484). After a year as an assistant, Lyle Smith was promoted to head football coach of Boise Junior College in 1947. Smith saw incredible success as head coach, winning his first 31 games in a row as head coach. In 1950, the team moved into a new 10,000-seat stadium. With the outbreak of the Korean War, Smith, still undefeated as a head coach, was recalled to the Navy and was only able to coach in the first three games of the 1950 season.[6][7] George Blankley assumed the head coaching duties for the remainder of 1950 and the entire 1951 season in Smith's absence and compiled a 16–2 (.889) record. Smith returned as head coach in 1952 and stretched his winning streak all the way to 37 games before suffering his first defeat. In 1954, Smith was a leading candidate for the vacant job at his alma mater Idaho, but withdrew his name from consideration, content at Boise.[8][9] Boise won thirteen conference titles in football under Smith and the NJCAA National Football Championship in 1958.[10] Smith's final record is 150–25–6 (.845).[5] Coach Smith never had a losing season as the head coach. Boise State's football program moved up to four-year status in 1968 under new head coach Tony Knap and competed as an NAIA independent for two seasons.[11][12] The Broncos were accepted into the NCAA in October 1969,[13] and a month later into the Big Sky Conference, effective the following July.[14] The Broncos began NCAA competition in 1970 in Division II (\"College Division\" prior to 1973) in a brand new Bronco Stadium.[15] Knap and the Broncos won three consecutive Big Sky titles from 1973 to 1975 and compiled a record of 71–19–1.[5] Knap was succeeded by Jim Criner in 1976, a defensive assistant the previous season under Dick Vermeil at UCLA, the Rose Bowl champions. BSU won the Big Sky again in 1977, and in 1978, the Broncos and the Big Sky moved up to the new Division I-AA (renamed FCS in 2006). A scouting violation late that season at NAU resulted in probation and compromised an excellent 10–1 season in 1979, undefeated in conference at 7–0;[16] the Broncos were ineligible for the Big Sky title and I-AA playoffs.[17][18][19] Off probation in 1980, BSU won its first national title, taking the I-AA national championship over defending champion Eastern Kentucky in Sacramento. A runner-up to Idaho State in the Big Sky in 1981, BSU hosted Eastern Kentucky in the I-AA semifinals, but lost, 17–23. Criner departed after the 1982 season to accept the head football coach position at Iowa State;[20] his overall record at BSU was 59–21–1 (.735).[5] Lyle Setencich was promoted from defensive coordinator to head coach of Boise State following Criner's departure. Under Setencich, Boise State posted a 24–20 record in four seasons.[21] Setencich's final season in 1986, the first season of blue turf, saw the first losing campaign (5–6) for the Broncos football program in four decades, winning just one road game and losing the final two home games. He lost all four rivalry games against Idaho and resigned following the season.[21] Skip Hall, previously an assistant coach under Don James at Washington, was hired after Setencich's resignation.[22] In Hall's second season in 1988, the Broncos returned to the Division I-AA playoffs, their first appearance since 1981. Hall's best season was in 1990, when Boise State advanced to the national semifinals, falling in a high scoring game against Big Sky rival Nevada, the conference champion whom the Broncos had defeated a month earlier in Boise. Hall lost all six against Idaho; he resigned after six seasons, with a 42–28 (.600) record.[5][22] The Broncos turned to Portland State head coach Pokey Allen to lead the Boise State football team after Hall resigned. In Allen's second season, the Broncos returned to the championship game in 1994.[23] After 26 years in the Big Sky, BSU joined the Big West Conference in 1996 and moved up to Division I-A (now FBS). The Broncos had an interim head coach for part of 1996 as Allen battled cancer.[24] Allen died due to the cancer in December 1996.[24] Head coach Houston Nutt made the step up to NCAA Division I-A the next year when Boise State hired him away from Murray State to take over the program.[25] Two years after making the Division I-AA finals in 1994, Boise State's first year in Division I-A had been difficult and was looking for a recruiter and motivator to jump start their program following Allen's death. Nutt's team posted a 5–6 record in 1997,[26] playing at the Division I-A level with its Division I-AA players. Nutt's team beat rival Idaho on the road in overtime for the first BSU win in Moscow since 1981. Additionally, Boise State almost pulled off an upset against Wisconsin of the Big Ten. Nutt resigned as head coach after just one season to accept the head football coach position at Arkansas.[27] In three seasons under head coach Dirk Koetter, who previously served as Oregon's offensive coordinator,[28] the Broncos were 26–10, won two Big West championships and moved to the Western Athletic Conference effective in 2001. In his three winning seasons at Boise State, Koetter won ten or more games twice, with two bowl wins. Koetter departed the Broncos after the 2000 season for Arizona State in the Pac-10.[29] Dan Hawkins was promoted from offensive coordinator to head coach on December 2, 2000.[30] In 2004, Hawkins was honored with his second Western Athletic Conference (WAC) Coach of the Year title in three years. Through the 2005 season, he compiled a 53–11 record as Boise State's head coach, including a 37–3 record in WAC competition with four straight WAC titles. Only Walter Camp, George Washington Woodruff and Bob Pruett had more total wins in their first five years of head coaching. He holds a 31–game WAC winning streak, the longest in conference history.[31] One of his first hires at Boise State was Chris Petersen as his offensive coordinator; Petersen was a quarterback at UC Davis while Hawkins was an assistant coach, and was the wide receivers coach at Oregon under head coach Mike Bellotti. After five seasons at the helm of the Broncos football program, Hawkins left for Colorado of the Big 12 Conference.[32] He had three top 25 finishes, won ten or more games three times, and won two bowl games. Following Hawkins' departure, offensive coordinator Chris Petersen was promoted to head coach.[33] At Boise State, Petersen won two Paul \"Bear\" Bryant National Coach of the Year Awards, voted on by the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association.[34] He is the first coach to receive this award twice, which debuted in 1986 (it has since been awarded twice to Nick Saban and three times to Dabo Swinney). Under Petersen, Boise State recorded two undefeated seasons, three undefeated regular seasons, and reached the Bowl Championship Series twice. The 2006 season was capped with a memorable upset of Oklahoma in the Fiesta Bowl, while the 2009 team defeated TCU in the Fiesta Bowl to finish at 14–0 and were fourth in both major polls. They were just the second team ever to go 14–0 in the history of major college football. Petersen brought Boise State football its highest ranking during the 2010 season. The team rose to second in the Associated Press poll during weeks 7, 8, and 9, and No. 2 in the Coaches' Poll, as well as earning the No. 3 slot in the first BCS ranking.[35] After 2010, Boise State joined the Mountain West Conference.[36] In May 2011, Boise State Athletics was cited by the NCAA for \"lack of institutional control,\" for one major violation in women's tennis and several minor violations in four sports, including football. While the football program's violations were minor (student athletes provided fellow recruits with meals and beds while visiting campus), the football program suffered serious penalties nonetheless.[37] The Boise State football program was given three years' probation, lost three scholarships a year, and had its number of Fall practices reduced.[38] As a result of the NCAA violations, Gene Bleymaier, the athletic director who brought blue turf to Boise State in 1986 and promoted Petersen 20 years later, was asked to resign, and ultimately fired when he refused.[39] Despite President Bob Kustra's firing of Bleymaier, boosters continued to support him. Just two years later, the new football facility was named in his honor.[40] Between 2008 and 2011, the Broncos went 50–3 to become the first FBS team to win 50 games over a four-year span. With the 50–3 record, quarterback Kellen Moore became the winningest quarterback in FBS history, passing former Texas quarterback Colt McCoy (45 wins). On December 7, 2011, it was announced that the Broncos would join the Big East Conference as football-only members in July 2013, in a division with Memphis, SMU, Houston, San Diego State, and Temple.[41] However, the following year Boise State announced they had decided to stay in the Mountain West Conference, leaving the Big East without ever playing a game in the conference. Petersen accepted the head coaching position at the University of Washington of the Pac-12 Conference on December 6, 2013.[42] The vacancy was created when the Huskies' Steve Sarkisian left to take the head coaching position at USC.[43][44] Petersen finished his eight seasons as head coach of Boise State with a record of 92–12 (.885), with three top 10 finishes, seven seasons with ten or more wins, six top 25 finishes, two Fiesta Bowl titles, five bowl wins, and five conference titles. He was at BSU for a total of 13 years, the first five as offensive coordinator under Hawkins.[45] Assistant head coach Bob Gregory was named interim head coach for Boise State's bowl game.[46] On December 11, 2013, Arkansas State head coach Bryan Harsin returned to his alma mater as Petersen's replacement.[47] Harsin had been an assistant for the Broncos under Petersen and was co-offensive coordinator at Texas under Mack Brown.[47] In his first season in 2014, they went 10–2 in the regular season and won the Mountain West Championship Game, defeating Fresno State 28–14. This was Boise State's first outright Mountain West Conference championship. The Broncos faced the Arizona Wildcats in the Fiesta Bowl and won 38–30 for a 12–2 record and were ranked 15th in both major polls. Boise State shared the Mountain division title in 2016, going 10–3 with wins over Washington State and Oregon State. BSU was 11–3 in 2017 and won their second Mountain west conference championship under Harsin with a 17–14 win over Fresno State in the Mountain West Championship Game. Boise State capped the season with a Las Vegas Bowl win over Oregon and climbed to 22nd in both final polls. In 2018, Boise State was 10–3 overall; they won the Mountain Division championship and beat three teams that won ten or more games (Troy, Utah State, and Fresno State) and were ranked in both final polls. In 2019 Boise State went 12–2 won the opener at Florida State went 8–0 in the Mountain West conference play for the first time in the regular season, won the Mountain Division and won the conference championship 31–10 vs Hawaii and finished ranked in both final polls. Under Harsin, Boise State is 69–19 (.784) through 2020, with at least nine wins per year, a 3–2 record in bowl games, 1 Fiesta Bowl title, Have been ranked in the top 25 in the polls at some point in every season, won three conference titles, five division titles, and have been in the AP final poll four times. On December 22, 2020, Harsin resigned to become the head coach at Auburn.[48] He finished at Boise State with a seven-year record of 69–19. On January 8, 2021, Boise State hired Oregon defensive coordinator Andy Avalos as their new head coach.[49] Avalos, a former player and assistant coach for the Broncos, signed a five-year contract worth $7.75 million.[50] Being on the verge of the team's first losing season since 1997, it was announced on November 12, 2023 that Avalos was being let go.[51] The remainder of his contract would be bought out, an amount near $3 million.[52] He led the Broncos to a 2022 Mountain West Championship Game (L 28–16 to Fresno State) and the 2022 Frisco Bowl, where the Broncos defeated North Texas 35-32. Avalos ended his career as head coach with a record of 22–14 in three seasons. On December 11, 2023, Avalos was hired as defensive coordinator by Texas Christian. [53] After Andy Avalos was let go with two games remaining in the 2023 regular season, Defensive Coordinator Spencer Danielson was announced as the interim head coach for the remainder of the season. Danielson was elevated to full-time head coach after winning the next three games, including the MWC Championship Game at UNLV. Danielson's first game as full-time head coach was against UCLA in the LA Bowl. The Broncos lost 22-35 and finished the season 8-6, with Danielson finishing with a record of 3-1. Head coaching records since Boise State became a four-year school in 1968. NAIA (1968–69), NCAA Division II (1970–77), Division I-AA (1978–95), Division I-A/FBS (1996–present) In 1980, The Big Sky Conference introduced overtime for all their games. This eventually set a precedent which lead to the elimination of all tied contests across the league by 1996. Boise State claims two national titles in the Junior College Division and at the NCAA Division I FCS. § – Conference co–champions † – Division co–champions, did not play in MW Championship Game. Prior to the 2023 season, the Mountain West did away with divisions and established the two top teams with the best in-conference record would play each other for the conference championship. Since joining the Mountain West, Boise State has won five conference championships, which started with the 2012 team, who went 7–1 to tie with Fresno State and San Diego State. The Mountain West held their first Championship Game the following year; Boise State has reached the Championship Game eight times and won five, with each the most among all schools in the conference. The Broncos have appeared in 22 official D-I-A bowl games with a record of 13–8, including two wins in BCS bowl games and one win in a New Year's Six bowl. They also appears in the Division II 1973 Pioneer Bowl, 1971 Camellia Bowl and 1980 Camellia Bowl. Their appearance in the 2018 First Responder Bowl was ruled a no contest after being canceled due to inclement weather. On December 5, 2021, Boise State received a bid to play Central Michigan in the Arizona Bowl. However, On December 27, 2021, Barstool Sports (the title sponsor of the bowl) founder David Portnoy announced the withdrawal of the Broncos from the bowl due to COVID-19 issues within the program. Through the 2024 season, Boise State has a streak of 27 straight seasons of bowl eligibility, which is the longest active streak in the country.[54] † CFP/New Year's Six/BCS game The Broncos were members of Division I-AA for eighteen seasons, from its inception in 1978 through 1995. They appeared in the I-AA playoffs five times with a record of 8–4, and were I-AA national champions in 1980. The Broncos appeared in the Division II playoffs three times, with an overall record of 1–3; all three losses were to the eventual national champions. In 1977, Boise State (9–2) was undefeated in the Big Sky (6–0) and won another title. Due their regular season not ending until November 26 at Idaho, the same day as the first round of the Division II playoffs, BSU was replaced by runner-up Northern Arizona, who lost 35–0 at home. The Broncos had one appearance in the NCAA College Division postseason, with a victory in the West regional final in the Camellia Bowl in 1971.[55] No semifinals or finals were played in the College Division from 1964 through 1972, a poll followed the four quarterfinals. Since 1970, Boise State has played its home games in Albertsons Stadium (known as Bronco Stadium until May 2014), which enjoys a reputation as one of the most difficult places in the country for opposing teams to play. The stadium is well known for its blue artificial surface, first installed in 1986, making it the first college stadium field to be any color other than traditional green, as well as the only college to have a non-green field for 22 years (1986–2008). \"The Blue,\" as it is called by fans, is one of the most distinguishing and enduring symbols of Boise State football. Boise State holds a trademark on any non-green field, not just blue. Therefore, anyone (high school, college, or otherwise) must apply for a license from Boise State before installing a football field any color other than green. Boise State is one of 7 college football programs in the United States to have a non-green playing surface. Other schools with non-green fields are as follows: (FBS) Eastern Michigan University (gray), Coastal Carolina University (teal), (FCS) Eastern Washington University (red), the University of Central Arkansas (grey and purple), (Division II) the University of New Haven (blue), (NAIA) Lindenwood University (red and grey). Hosei University in Tokyo, Japan also has a blue football field. Boise State recently approved the proposal for a blue field at Luther College (Division III). As of December 7, 2019, the Broncos are 128–9 (.934) at home since the 1999 season. The Broncos won 47 straight home conference games from 1999 to 2011 and were undefeated at home in conference play during their 10 years in the WAC (40–0). The Broncos are 122–7 (.946) in regular season home games since 1999, and had a winning streak of 65 regular season games from 2001 to 2011. Their current home winning streak stands at 0. In 2011, citing a \"competitive advantage,\" the Mountain West Conference banned Boise State from wearing their all-blue uniforms for home conference games as a condition of joining the conference.[56] When questioned about the ban, Mountain West Commissioner Craig Thompson confirmed that either the jerseys or pants could be blue, provided that the other be white or orange.[57] After Boise State decided to not join the Big East Conference and remain in the Mountain West the uniform restrictions were lifted beginning in the 2013 season. The NCAA considered a rule that would have required a team's uniform, either jersey or pants, to contrast the playing surface. The rule would have banned Boise State's all blue uniforms at home and most other teams from wearing all green uniforms as well. The NCAA eventually decided against instituting the rule. In 2012, Boise State granted special permission and an international trademark to Hosei University in Tokyo, Japan, for use of the blue field turf for their football field, Tomahawks Field.[58][59] BSU has had a rivalry with Fresno State University since joining the WAC. The series is 17–9 all time in favor of Boise State. In 2001, the series became a WAC match-up, christened with Boise State's upset over No. 8 Fresno State 35–30. In 2005, the series became the Battle for the Milk Can, and No. 20 Fresno State ended Boise State's 31-game winning streak against WAC opponents with their 27–7 victory. After being played as a non-conference game in 2011, the series continued as a conference game in 2012. The winner of the game receives the Milk Can. Although Fresno State has five all-time wins over Boise State, only two wins have come since they have played each other every year since 2001. In the 2014 season, Boise State played Fresno State twice, winning both times, the second one coming in the Mountain West Championship, which Boise State won for the first time. Fresno State was looking to repeat as champions. They met twice in 2017 in back-to-back weeks as they ended the regular season with a game in Fresno, which Fresno won, before meeting the next week in the Mountain West Championship in Boise, which Boise won. In 2018, Boise State upset No. 16 Fresno State 24–17 to end Fresno's seven game winning streak. Three weeks later, the Bulldogs avenged their regular season loss by defeating Boise State 19–16 in overtime in a snow covered Mountain West Championship Game. The rivalry is no longer an annual affair following the expansion of the MW to 12 football members in 2013. At that time, Boise State and Fresno State were placed in separate football divisions (respectively, Mountain and West). As part of the new scheduling arrangement, all cross-divisional games rotate in a four-year cycle, with two years of play followed by two years off. This in turn means that the game was not played in 2015 or 2016. Boise State had a 40-year in-state rivalry with the University of Idaho, which began with a Bronco victory in the first meeting in 1971. They met every year through 2010, and with the exception of four years (2001–2004), the matchup was a conference game. The rivalry was dominated by streaks as Idaho won 12 straight years from 1982 to 1993, while Boise State won the most recent 12 games between 1999 and 2010, mostly by large margins. BSU leads the rivalry with a series record of 22–17–1 (.563). After Boise State's move to the Mountain West Conference in 2011, Boise State has refused to play Idaho home and home in football. As a response, Idaho has refused to play Boise State at ExtraMile Arena for men's basketball. As of 2021, no future games for football or men's basketball have been scheduled; with Idaho having returned to FCS football in 2018, the football rivalry is unlikely to resume in the foreseeable future. 2024 Boise State has a long-standing rivalry with Nevada. Boise State leads the series 30–13. Boise State and Nevada have been conference rivals in the Big Sky Conference, the Big West Conference, the WAC, and the Mountain West. However, the series is no longer an annual affair after the 2013 expansion, as Nevada was placed in the opposite division from Boise State. They play each other only twice every four years. The last game was in 2018 with the next game coming in 2021. The series was played as a non-conference game in 2011 as the teams met in Boise during Nevada's last year in the WAC. Nevada split the WAC championship with Boise State in 2005 as both teams finished 7–1 in conference play. Boise State beat Nevada in the last game of the season in 2006, giving Boise State a berth into their first BCS bowl. In 2007, in one of the highest scoring games in NCAA Division I football history, Boise State defeated Nevada 69–67 in four overtimes. Recently, the conference championship has been decided by the Wolf Pack and Broncos' late-season games. In 2010, Nevada defeated No. 3 Boise State 34–31 in overtime, ending the Broncos' BCS National Championship hopes. The rivalry between the two schools felt as if it had been rekindled after Nevada's win, since Boise State had won the past 10 games dating back to 1998. Boise State and Nevada have played one time in the postseason in the 1990 I-AA semifinal. Nevada won the game in triple overtime 59–52, and would go on to lose in the final. Announced schedules as of September 10, 2024.[60][61] Previously called the Quarterback of the Year Award, this accolade differs from Sammy Baugh Trophy in that it goes to top quarterback, rather than the top passer. Its name was changed to its current identity in 2012, honoring two-time winner Kellen Moore, who became the FBS all-time leader in wins by a quarterback after going 50–3 as the starter at Boise State.",

                "content": "Russell Carrington Wilson (born November 29, 1988) is an American professional football quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League (NFL). He previously played 10 seasons for the Seattle Seahawks and two seasons for the Denver Broncos. With the Seahawks, Wilson was named to the Pro Bowl nine times and helped Seattle win their first Super Bowl championship in Super Bowl XLVIII. He is regarded as one of the greatest dual-threat quarterbacks of all time.[1] Wilson played college football and baseball for the NC State Wolfpack from 2008 to 2010 before transferring to the Wisconsin Badgers in 2011, where he set the single-season FBS record for passer rating and led them to a Big Ten title and the 2012 Rose Bowl. He also played minor league baseball for the Tri-City Dust Devils in 2010 and the Asheville Tourists in 2011 as a second baseman. The Seattle Seahawks selected Wilson in the third round (75th overall) of the 2012 NFL draft. He tied the rookie record for most passing touchdowns and was named Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Year.[2] Wilson then led the Seahawks to consecutive Super Bowl appearances, winning Super Bowl XLVIII and losing Super Bowl XLIX after Wilson was intercepted at the goal line by Malcolm Butler. Wilson holds the record for most wins by an NFL quarterback through nine seasons and is one of five quarterbacks with a career passer rating over 100.[3] In 2019, he signed a four-year, $140 million contract extension with the Seahawks, becoming the highest-paid NFL player at the time. In 2020, he became the third quarterback in NFL history to throw 30 touchdowns in four consecutive seasons.[4] Wilson was traded to the Broncos in 2022 and later signed a five-year, $245 million extension. His time with the Broncos was marred with disappointment, with the Broncos having the league's worst scoring offense in 2022. Wilson was benched near the end of the 2023 season and was released in the offseason, later signing a one-year deal with the Steelers. Noted for his philanthropy, Wilson was named the Walter Payton Man of the Year in 2020 and was the recipient of the Bart Starr Award in 2022. Wilson is also part owner of the Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer (MLS). After he purchased his minority stake, the Sounders won the 2019 MLS Cup. Wilson was born at The Christ Hospital in Cincinnati,[5] and grew up in Richmond, Virginia. His parents are Harrison Benjamin Wilson III, a lawyer, and Tammy Wilson (née Turner), a nurse director.[6][7][8] He has an older brother, Harrison IV, and a younger sister, Anna.[9] Wilson started playing football with his father and brother at the age of four, and played his first organized game for the Tuckahoe Tomahawks youth football team in sixth grade.[6][10] Wilson's great-great-grandfather was enslaved to a Confederate colonel and was freed after the American Civil War.[11] Wilson's paternal grandfather, Harrison B. Wilson Jr., was a former president of Norfolk State University who played football and basketball at Kentucky State University, and his paternal grandmother, Anna W. Wilson, was on the faculty at Jackson State University.[12] Wilson's maternal grandfather was noted painter A. B. Jackson.[13] According to genetic admixture analysis, Wilson is 62% African, 36% European, 1% West Asian, and 1% Central Asian.[14][15][16] His European family lineage has been traced back to 524 A.D. to Saint Arnulf of Metz via Charlemagne.[17][18][19][20][21] Wilson has also said he has some Native American ancestry, although he did not explicitly say which tribe he came from.[22][23] Wilson's father played football and baseball at Dartmouth and was a wide receiver for the San Diego Chargers preseason squad in 1980. Wilson's brother, Harry, played football and baseball at the University of Richmond, and his sister Anna played basketball at Stanford.[24][25][26][27][28] Wilson's father died of complications from diabetes on June 9, 2010, at age 55,[24] the day after Wilson was drafted by the Rockies.[29] Wilson attended Collegiate School, a preparatory school in Richmond, Virginia.[30] As a junior in 2005, he threw for 3,287 passing yards and 40 passing touchdowns and rushed for 634 rushing yards and 15 rushing touchdowns.[31] He was named an all-district, all-region, and all-state player. Wilson was twice named the Richmond Times-Dispatch Player of the Year.[32] As a senior, he threw for 3,009 passing yards, 34 passing touchdowns, and seven interceptions. In addition, he rushed for 1,132 yards and 18 touchdowns.[33] That year, he was named an all-conference and all-state player as well as conference player of the year. He was featured in Sports Illustrated for his performance in the state championship game win. Wilson also served as his senior class president.[34] During his time in high school, Wilson attended the Manning Passing Academy, a summer football clinic run by multiple NFL MVP winner and eventual Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning. Due to this encounter, Manning recognized Wilson many years later when the latter had flown to Denver to discuss the prospect of getting drafted by the Denver Broncos, where Manning had recently signed.[35] Wilson was also a member of the Collegiate School basketball and baseball teams.[36] Sources: Wilson committed to North Carolina State University on July 23, 2006.[37] He also received a football scholarship offer from Duke University.[38] Wilson redshirted during the 2007 season at NC State.[39] In 2008, Wilson initially split time at quarterback with senior Daniel Evans and junior Harrison Beck.[40] However, Evans and Beck saw no regular season action after Week 2 and Week 5, respectively. Thereafter, Wilson led the team to a 4–3 record in the regular season which NC State finished out on a four-game winning streak.[41] During a 30–24 win over East Carolina, Wilson threw for 201 yards and three touchdowns.[42] He threw for two touchdowns in each of the last six games in the regular season.[43] In the 2008 PapaJohns.com Bowl against Rutgers, Wilson threw for 186 yards and a touchdown and rushed for 46 yards before halftime. Late in the first half, he scrambled to the Rutgers' four-yard line, where he was tackled and suffered a knee sprain. With Wilson sitting out the remainder of the game, his replacements threw a combined total of three interceptions with NC State, eventually losing 29–23.[44][40] Over the course of the season, he completed 150 of 275 attempts for 1,955 yards and 17 touchdowns with just one interception. He also recorded 116 carries for 394 yards and four touchdowns.[43] The Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) named him the first-team All-ACC quarterback. It was the first time in conference history that a freshman quarterback was named to the first team.[45] Prior to the 2009 season, Wilson was named quarterback of the pre-season all-ACC football team on July 12. On September 19, Wilson broke Andre Woodson's all-time NCAA record of 325 consecutive pass attempts without an interception against Gardner–Webb.[46] The 379-pass streak ended in a game against Wake Forest on October 3.[47] Wilson held the record until November 10, 2012, when it was broken by Louisiana Tech quarterback Colby Cameron.[48] Wilson was named honorable mention All-ACC in 2009.[49] Wilson finished the 2009 regular season with 3,027 passing yards, 31 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions as the team finished with a 5–7 record.[50][51] Wilson led the 2010 Wolfpack to a 9–4 season that included a 23–7 win over West Virginia in the 2010 Champs Sports Bowl.[52][53] He led the ACC in passing yards per game (274.1) and total offensive yards per game (307.5).[54] He was named second-team All-ACC and runner-up for ACC Football Player of the Year.[49] In May 2010, Wilson graduated from NC State in three years with a BA in communication, and took graduate-level business courses in the fall semester during the 2010 football season.[55][56][57][58][59] In January 2011, Wilson announced that he would report to spring training with the Colorado Rockies organization.[60] NC State head coach Tom O'Brien expressed reservations with Wilson's decision, saying \"Russell and I have had very open conversations about his responsibilities respective to baseball and football. While I am certainly respectful of Russell's dedication to baseball these last several years, within those discussions I also communicated to him the importance of his time commitment to NC State football.\"[61] O'Brien and his staff reached out to NFL coaches and general managers on Wilson's behalf, but he failed to receive an invitation to the 2011 NFL Scouting Combine.[62] On April 29, 2011, O'Brien announced that Wilson was granted a release from his football scholarship with one year of eligibility left.[63] On June 27, 2011, Wisconsin head coach Bret Bielema said that Wilson committed to Wisconsin for the 2011 season.[64] In the season opener against UNLV, Wilson passed for 255 yards and two touchdowns in a 51–17 victory. He also rushed for 62 yards, including a 46-yard touchdown run.[65] In the next three games, Wilson threw for three passing touchdowns in each game, victories over Oregon State, Northern Illinois, and South Dakota.[66][67][68] Following a 48–17 victory over previously undefeated #8 Nebraska, Wilson recorded a receiving touchdown in the 59–7 victory over Indiana.[69][70] Wilson helped lead the Badgers to a 6–0 start and a #4 ranking in the AP Poll.[71] The Badgers dropped their next two games, road losses to Michigan State and Ohio State.[72][73] Wilson and the Badgers reeled off four consecutive wins to end the regular season. Wilson was efficient during the winning streak, passing for nine touchdowns to no interceptions while rushing for two touchdowns.[74] At the end of the regular season, Wilson was named first team All-Big Ten by both the coaches and media. He also won the Griese-Brees Big Ten Quarterback of the Year award.[75] In the inaugural Big Ten Championship Game on December 3, Wilson threw for three touchdowns and led the Badgers to a 42–39 win over the Michigan State Spartans. Wilson was named the game's Grange-Griffin MVP.[76] In December 2011, Wilson was named a third team All-American by Yahoo! Sports, and finished ninth in Heisman Trophy voting with 52 points.[77][78] In the 2012 Rose Bowl against the Oregon Ducks on January 2, 2012, Wilson had 19 pass completions on 25 attempts for 296 yards, 18 rushing yards, and three touchdowns (two passing, one rushing) as the Badgers lost by a score of 45–38.[79] Wilson finished the season with 33 passing touchdowns, which set the single season record at Wisconsin and was the second-most in Big Ten history behind Drew Brees during the 1998 season at Purdue (39).[80] Wilson also set the single season FBS record for passing efficiency (191.8).[81] On January 28, 2012, Wilson completed his college football career at the 2012 Senior Bowl.[82] After transferring to the University of Wisconsin, Wilson earned a master's degree in educational leadership and policy analysis.[83] On January 16, 2012, Wilson began training for the NFL Scouting Combine at the IMG Madden Football Academy in Bradenton, Florida.[84][85] Prior to the 2012 NFL draft, Wilson had been projected by NFL scouts and analysts to be a middle-round pick.[86] In February 2012, former NFL quarterback and director of the IMG Madden Football Academy Chris Weinke said of Wilson, \"If he was 6–5, he'd probably be the No. 1 pick in the draft.\"[84] On April 11, 2012, ESPN Monday Night Football analyst Jon Gruden said, \"The only issue with Russell Wilson is his height. That might be the reason he's not picked in the first couple rounds.\"[87] Wilson was selected by the Seattle Seahawks in the third round (75th overall) of the 2012 NFL Draft,[91] the sixth quarterback selected.[92] The Seahawks received significant criticism for their selections in the draft, and Wilson in particular, as they had just signed free agent Matt Flynn.[93] Two weeks later, Wilson signed a four-year, $2.99 million contract with the Seahawks on May 7, 2012.[94] Wilson made his preseason debut against the Tennessee Titans on August 11, 2012, and had his first preseason start on August 24 against the Kansas City Chiefs.[95][96] Two days later on August 26, 2012, Wilson was named the starting quarterback for the first regular season game after competing with Matt Flynn and Tarvaris Jackson for the position.[97] On September 9, 2012, Wilson made his regular season debut in a 20–16 road loss to the Arizona Cardinals. He had 18 completions on 34 passing attempts for 153 yards, one touchdown, and one interception.[98] In the third regular season game on Monday night, the Seahawks won 14–12 over the Green Bay Packers on a controversial Hail Mary touchdown pass to Golden Tate.[99] The contentious nature of the replacement officials' decision on the play was widely considered to have been the tipping point that led to an agreement being reached to end the referee lockout.[100][101] Wilson earned Rookie of the Week honors for his performance in a 28–7 victory over the New York Jets on November 11; he completed 12 of 19 passes for 188 yards and two touchdowns, and rushed for 34 yards on seven attempts.[102] He was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week and FedEx Player of the Week for his performance in a 23–17 road win over the Chicago Bears in overtime on December 2.[103] In a 50–17 victory over the Buffalo Bills in Toronto on December 16, Wilson had 205 passing yards, one passing touchdown, nine rushes, 92 rushing yards, and a career-high three rushing touchdowns.[104] He earned NFL Offensive Rookie of the Month honors for December 2012 after the Seahawks went 5–0 and he had a passer rating of 115.2.[105] Wilson finished the 2012 regular season ranked fourth in the NFL in passer rating (100.0), beating the previous rookie record set by Ben Roethlisberger in 2004 (98.1), since broken by Robert Griffin III in 2012 (102.4) and Dak Prescott in 2016 (104.9).[106] He threw for 3,118 yards and 26 touchdowns, tying Peyton Manning's record for most touchdowns thrown by a rookie,[107] and rushed for 489 yards and four touchdowns. Wilson's scrambling mobility and ability to extend plays outside the pocket with his legs earned numerous comparisons to Hall of Fame quarterback Fran Tarkenton.[108][109][110] Wilson led the Seahawks to the postseason in his rookie year, with both games on the road in January. He made his postseason debut in the NFC Wild Card Round against the Washington Redskins, passing for 187 yards and rushing for 67 yards as the Seahawks rallied for a 24–14 comeback victory.[111] In the Divisional Round against the Atlanta Falcons, Wilson threw for 385 yards and rushed for 60 yards, and his team had a 28–27 lead with 31 seconds to go, but the Falcons managed to kick the winning field goal.[112] Wilson was selected as an alternate for the 2013 Pro Bowl, filling in for Matt Ryan of Atlanta.[113] At the Pro Bowl in Hawaii on January 27, Wilson completed eight of ten passes for 98 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions for a 147.1 rating.[114] At the end of the season, Wilson earned a bonus of $222,000 through the NFL's Performance-Based Pay program.[115][116] He was ranked 51st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2013.[117] The Seahawks began the 2013 season with the first 4–0 start in franchise history, before losing to the Indianapolis Colts in Week 5.[118] The Seahawks then went on a 7-game winning streak, including a 41–20 victory over the Minnesota Vikings where he posted a career-high 151.4 passer rating and culminating in a 34–7 victory over the New Orleans Saints in Week 13 in which Wilson threw three touchdown passes and earned his second NFC Offensive Player of the Week award.[119][120][121] Over the next three weeks, the Seahawks suffered divisional losses to the San Francisco 49ers and Arizona Cardinals (the loss to the Cardinals was Wilson's first home loss), but defeated the St. Louis Rams in Week 17 to finish the season with a 13–3 record, the NFC West title, and the No. 1 seed in the playoffs.[122] Wilson finished the season with 26 touchdown passes, nine interceptions, and a 101.2 passer rating, becoming the first quarterback in the Super Bowl era to post a 100+ passer rating in each of his first two seasons.[123] Wilson was named to his second Pro Bowl on December 27, 2013.[124] In the Divisional Round, the Seahawks defeated the New Orleans Saints by a score of 23–15. On January 19, 2014, Wilson and the Seahawks defeated the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship by a score of 23–17, advancing to Super Bowl XLVIII.[125] Wilson threw for 206 yards, two touchdowns, and no interceptions for a 123.1 passer rating in a 43–8 win over the Denver Broncos to give the Seahawks their first Super Bowl victory in franchise history.[126][127] With the victory, Wilson became just the second black starting quarterback to win a Super Bowl, joining Super Bowl XXII winner Doug Williams.[128] At 5'11\", he also became the shortest quarterback to win a Super Bowl, shorter than Len Dawson, Joe Theismann, and Drew Brees (all 6'0\").[129] Wilson earned a bonus of $169,141.73 for the 2013 season through the NFL's Performance-Based Pay program.[130] He was ranked 20th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2014.[131] On September 21, 2014, Wilson led the Seahawks on an 80-yard touchdown drive in overtime to defeat the Denver Broncos, 26–20, in a Week 3 rematch of the previous season's Super Bowl.[132][133] On October 6, 2014, against the Washington Redskins, Wilson set a new Monday Night Football record for rushing yards by a quarterback in a single game with 122.[134] The Seahawks clinched a playoff spot in Week 16 when the Dallas Cowboys defeated the Indianapolis Colts by a score of 42–7, eliminating the Philadelphia Eagles from postseason contention and allowing the Seahawks to clinch their spot before their Sunday Night Football matchup. On December 21, 2014, Wilson went 20-of-31 and threw for a then-career-high 339 yards with two touchdown passes and a rushing touchdown against the Arizona Cardinals in a primetime matchup on Sunday Night Football.[135] Wilson also led the offense in gaining 596 yards, setting a franchise record for most yards gained in a game. The Cardinals had the third-best scoring defense heading into Week 16. The Seahawks won 35–6 as they snapped the Cardinals' seven-game home winning streak and regained first place in the NFC West as well as the NFC's #1 seed. The Seahawks defeated the St. Louis Rams 20–6 in Week 17 to clinch the NFC West and the #1 seed for the second consecutive season, securing homefield advantage for the entirety of the NFC playoffs.[136][137] Wilson led the Seahawks to a 31–17 home win over the Carolina Panthers in the Divisional Round, making the Seahawks the first defending Super Bowl Champion to win a playoff game since the 2005 Patriots.[138] The Seahawks hosted the Green Bay Packers in their second consecutive NFC Championship. Wilson threw three first-half interceptions while completing only two passes to his own team as the Seahawks fell behind 16–0 at halftime. With the Packers leading 19–7 and five minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, Wilson threw his fourth interception. Then Wilson led the Seahawks on an improbable comeback. On the Seahawks' next drive, Wilson ran the ball in for a touchdown to cut the deficit to 19–14. After a successful onside kick recovery, Wilson led the Seahawks down the field, and Lynch scored to give the Seahawks a 20–19 lead. Wilson completed a 15-yard, two-point conversion pass to Luke Willson to make it 22–19. The Packers tied it up with a field goal at the end of regulation and forced overtime. The Seahawks won the coin toss, and the offense took the field. Wilson led the Seahawks on an 80-yard drive that was capped by a 35-yard game-winning touchdown pass to Kearse.[139] The Seahawks completed their largest postseason comeback in franchise history and clinched a Super Bowl berth.[140] Wilson would have been selected as an alternate to the Pro Bowl, but did not play because the Seahawks advanced to the Super Bowl; as Wilson did not have a chance to decline the invitation, the NFL recognizes this as a Pro Bowl berth for him.[141] Wilson became the first quarterback in NFL history to start two Super Bowls in his first three professional seasons.[142] The Seahawks became the first defending champion to return to the Super Bowl since the 2004 Patriots.[143] They faced the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX, where they were defeated by a final score of 28–24. Although the Seahawks led 24–14 heading into the fourth quarter, the Patriots scored two consecutive touchdowns to take a four-point lead with 2:02 remaining. Wilson led the Seahawks to the Patriots' one-yard line with 25 seconds remaining, but Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler intercepted a pass intended for Ricardo Lockette, sealing the victory for the Patriots.[144][145] He was ranked 22nd by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2015.[146] On July 31, 2015, the Seahawks and Wilson agreed to a 4-year, $87.6 million contract extension, making him, at the time, the second-highest-paid player in the NFL.[147] In the first nine games of the season, Wilson threw 10 touchdown passes and seven interceptions. Over the next five games, Wilson threw 19 touchdowns and no interceptions, becoming the only quarterback in NFL history to throw 3+ touchdown passes and no interceptions in five consecutive games.[148] After a 2–4 start to the season, Wilson led the Seahawks to win seven of their next eight games and clinch a fourth consecutive playoff appearance in their Week 15 win over the Cleveland Browns.[149][150] His strong performance over the second half of the season, even after losing star running back Marshawn Lynch and tight end Jimmy Graham, led many analysts to consider Wilson an MVP candidate.[151] Wilson broke numerous Seahawks single season passing records in 2015, including most passing yards (4,024), most passing touchdowns (34), and highest passer rating (110.1).[152] He became the first Seahawks quarterback to throw for over 4,000 yards in a season, and finished the year with the highest passer rating in the NFL.[153][154] Wilson's 51.7% deep ball completion percentage was the highest among NFL quarterbacks.[155] On December 22, 2015, Wilson was named to his third Pro Bowl.[156] He was ranked 17th on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016.[157] The Seahawks traveled to Minnesota to face the Minnesota Vikings in the Wild Card Round. The temperature at kickoff was −6 °F (−25 °F wind chill), making it the third coldest game in NFL history.[158] Wilson struggled in the sub-zero temperatures, throwing for 142 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. The Vikings missed a short field goal in the last minute, allowing the Seahawks to advance to the Divisional Round to face the 15–1 Carolina Panthers.[159] Down 31–0 at the half, Wilson helped lead a furious comeback attempt, but the Panthers won 31–24, denying Wilson and the Seahawks their third consecutive in the NFC Championship and a shot at a third consecutive Super Bowl appearance. In that game, Wilson threw for 366 yards, three touchdowns, and two interceptions.[160] Wilson was drafted first overall by Team Irvin in the 2016 Pro Bowl draft,[161] and in the game threw eight completions on 12 attempts for 164 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions for a 149.3 rating.[162] He was named the Pro Bowl offensive MVP.[163] The Seahawks had a solid 2016 season with Wilson at the helm. However, Wilson drew two minor injuries: his ankle during Week 1 against the Miami Dolphins after getting stepped on by defensive lineman Ndamukong Suh,[164] and his left knee against the 49ers during Week 3 after a takedown by linebacker Eli Harold.[165] The injuries hampered Wilson's trademark mobility, and many speculated that he would be rested in order to properly recover.[166] Regardless, Wilson started all 16 games in the season.

In 2014, he led Seattle to a second straight Super Bowl berth as a two-time NFC Champion (2013, 2014). He has been recognized as one of the league’s top quarterback with nine NFL Pro Bowl selections to date. Russell recently completed his 10th season with the Seahawks and he holds the NFL record for most regular season wins by a QB in his first nine seasons (98) and the second-highest passer rating in NFL history. In Spring 2022, Russell signed with the Denver Broncos and started his first season with the team in Fall 2022. He is currently the quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers. Off the field, Russell has demonstrated a deep commitment to community service and cause work. In 2014, Russell founded The Why Not You Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to creating real and lasting change in the world by motivating and empowering today’s youth. In addition to financially supporting organizations aligned with the Foundation’s mission, Russell and his wife work to extend the Foundation’s impact by making weekly visits to Seattle Children’s Hospital where he lifts the spirits and brings joy to the hearts of patients and their families. In the fall of 2021, Russell and Ciara celebrated the grand opening of the first Why Not You Academy, a tuition-free charter public high school they founded alongside educational leaders Garth Reeves and Scott Canfield. Why Not You Academy serves systemically underserved students just South of Seattle by providing an innovative and tailored learning experience. In 2020, Russell co-hosted the ESPY Awards with Sue Bird and Megan Rapinoe. He led the show with a moving speech about the fight for racial equality in response to movement for Black lives across the world. He was recognized with NFL’s prestigious Walter Payton Man of the Year Award in 2021 which honored his longstanding commitment to giving back. He was also awarded the Bart Starr Award for his service, during the 2022 Super Bowl weekend. In the preceding year, he collaborated with Feeding America and Wheels Up to donate 10 million meals to families experiencing food insecurity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Russell’s leadership, passion and business acumen have resulted in assembling an impressive and diverse portfolio of business ventures. He has landed major endorsements and global ambassadorships with companies including Nike, Microsoft, Wilson, Alaska Airlines, Bose, Amazon, Verizon and Fantatics and he is the lead investor in a Juice Press franchise and TruFusion in Seattle. In 2016, Russell launched a men’s lifestyle apparel line, Good Man Brand, which is sold by major department stores including Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus, in addition to having a partnership with Amazon Fashion. The brand’s ethos is drawn from traits Russell found in the good men in his life and the clothing aims to bring out the best in its customers by helping them look good and feel good, so they can live life, work hard and help others. In 2020, Russell expanded his fashion empire with Ciara and together they created The House of LRC, based upon the principles of Love, Respect, and Care. The House of LR&C includes the already established Good Man Brand, Human Nation, a line that promotes the ideas of community, inclusivity, and sustainability, and Lita, an accessible, luxury line for women. As an extension of his work on the field, Russell and the late famed mental conditioning coach Trevor Moawad founded Limitless Minds, a business coaching consultancy dedicated to optimizing performance and enriching culture within some of the world’s top organizations and elite performers. Russell also established the Russell Wilson Quarterback Academy as a springboard to develop quarterback prospects using unique and cutting-edge curriculum based on his own experiences and knowledge. The quarterback school exists as an extension of the Russell Wilson Passing Academy, a summer football camp for children of all ages. Since its inception in 2012, the RWPA has held camps in nine cities and worked with more than 9,000 children. Continuing his commitment creating opportunities for kids to play football, he was recently named the Chairman of NFL Flag and helped found the Russell Wilson NFL Flag league in Seattle. Russell and Ciara also recently announced Why Not You Productions, their production company focused on scripted and unscripted film, television, and digital content projects. Projects through the shingle will focus on inspiring and aspiring narratives and human interest stories. Russell also heads Seattle-based West2East, a brand management, creative content and production company.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) Stephen Curry scored 11 straight points in the fourth quarter and 31 for the night as the Golden State Warriors beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 113-103 on Saturday night. Trayce Jackson-Davis had 15 points and nine rebounds, while Brandin Podziemski had 12 and Curry - who made seven 3-pointers - added 10 assists for the Warriors. Anthony Edwards and Donte DiVincenzo led Minnesota with 19 points apiece. Rudy Gobert had 18 points and 12 boards for Minnesota. Curry hit three 3-pointers and a pair of free throws in a 90-second span that helped the Warriors pull away after blowing a 21-point first-half lead. Warriors: What a difference two days makes. On Thursday, the Warriors allowed the Grizzlies to set a franchise record with 27 3-pointers in a 144-93 drubbing in Memphis but held Minnesota to 41.9% on the night. Timberwolves: After scoring 37 points in the first half, the Timberwolves exploded for 38 points in third quarter and came back to take the lead twice but ultimately couldn't crawl back from their early 36-15 deficit. With just under four minutes to play and the Warriors leading 96-94, Edwards missed the second of two free throws. The Warriors controlled the rebound and Curry curled off a screen, caught a pass and calmly drilled a 3-pointer on the other end. After making two free throws, Curry hit two more 3s to give Golden State a 107-96 lead. Minnesota made 6 of 22 shots (27.3%) in each of the first two quarters. Four of the Wolves' 12 first-half field goals were dunks, making them 8 for 40 (20%) on all other shots in the first half. The Warriors return home to face the Pacers while the Timberwolves visit Atlanta on Monday. --- AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba Copyright 2024 STATS LLC and Associated Press.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Warriors are on the road but looking no worse for wear. Sitting on a score of 79-75, they have looked like the better team, but there's still one more quarter to play. The Warriors entered the matchup with three straight defeats and they're well on their way to making it four. Can they turn things around, or will the Timberwolves hand them another loss? Only time will tell. Golden State Warriors @ Minnesota Timberwolves Current Records: Golden State 14-12, Minnesota 14-12 The Golden State Warriors will take on the Minnesota Timberwolves in a holiday battle at 8:00 p.m. ET on Saturday at at Target Center. The Warriors are no doubt hoping to put an end to a five-game streak of away losses. The Warriors are coming in off a wild two-game stretch: after soaring to 133 points on Sunday, they were much more limited against the Grizzlies on Thursday. They took a serious blow against Memphis, falling 144-93. Golden State was in a tough position after the first half, with the score already sitting at 69-38. The losing side was boosted by Brandin Podziemski, who went 9 for 13 en route to 21 points plus six assists and two steals. What's more, he also posted a 69.2% field goal percentage, which is the highest he's posted since back in April. Stephen Curry, on the other hand, was considerably less helpful: he went 0-6 from beyond the arc. Perhaps unsurprisingly given the score, the Warriors struggled to work together and finished the game with only 20 assists. They were crushed by their opponents in that department as the Grizzlies racked up 38. Meanwhile, the Timberwolves have relied on a stalwart defense averaging 106.62 points allowed per game, but that average took a hit on Thursday. They wound up on the wrong side of a painful 133-107 walloping at the hands of the Knicks. Minnesota didn't live up to their potential and found themselves falling short of the advantage oddsmakers thought they had coming into the game. Golden State's loss dropped their record down to 14-12. As for Minnesota, their defeat ended a three-game streak of wins at home and dropped them to 14-12. Keep an eye on the arc in Saturday's match: The Warriors have made nailing deep shots look easy this year this season, having averaged 15.4 threes per game. However, it's not like the Timberwolves struggle in that department as they've been averaging 14.9. Given these competing strengths, it'll be interesting to see how their clash plays out. The Warriors are hoping to beat the odds on Saturday, as the experts think they're headed for a loss. For those looking to play the spread, take note: they are a solid 7-4 against the spread when playing as the underdog. Minnesota is a 3.5-point favorite against Golden State, according to the latest NBA odds. The oddsmakers had a good feel for the line for this one, as the game opened with the Timberwolves as a 4-point favorite. The over/under is 213.5 points.
