                "content": "The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a massive, nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy from its surface mainly as visible light and infrared radiation with 10% at ultraviolet energies. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. The Sun has been an object of veneration in many cultures. It has been a central subject for astronomical research since antiquity. The Sun orbits the Galactic Center at a distance of 24,000 to 28,000 light-years. From Earth, it is 1 astronomical unit (1.496√ó108 km) or about 8 light-minutes away. Its diameter is about 1,391,400 km (864,600 mi), 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, making up about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. Roughly three-quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V), informally called a yellow dwarf, though its light is actually white. It formed approximately 4.6 billion[a] years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. Every second, the Sun's core fuses about 600 billion kilograms (kg) of hydrogen into helium and converts 4 billion kg of matter into energy. About 4 to 7 billion years from now, when hydrogen fusion in the Sun's core diminishes to the point where the Sun is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, its core will undergo a marked increase in density and temperature which will cause its outer layers to expand, eventually transforming the Sun into a red giant. This process will make the Sun large enough to render Earth uninhabitable approximately five billion years from the present. After the red giant phase, models suggest the Sun will shed its outer layers and become a dense type of cooling star (a white dwarf), and no longer produce energy by fusion, but will still glow and give off heat from its previous fusion for perhaps trillions of years. After that, it is theorized to become a super dense black dwarf, giving off negligible energy. The English word sun developed from Old English sunne. Cognates appear in other Germanic languages, including West Frisian sinne, Dutch zon, Low German S√ºnn, Standard German Sonne, Bavarian Sunna, Old Norse sunna, and Gothic sunn≈ç. All these words stem from Proto-Germanic *sunn≈çn.[17][18] This is ultimately related to the word for sun in other branches of the Indo-European language family, though in most cases a nominative stem with an l is found, rather than the genitive stem in n, as for example in Latin s≈çl, ancient Greek ·º•ŒªŒπŒøœÇ (hƒìlios), Welsh haul and Czech slunce, as well as (with *l > r) Sanskrit ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç (sv√°r) and Persian ÿÆŸàÿ± (xvar). Indeed, the l-stem survived in Proto-Germanic as well, as *s≈çwelan, which gave rise to Gothic sauil (alongside sunn≈ç) and Old Norse prosaic s√≥l (alongside poetic sunna), and through it the words for sun in the modern Scandinavian languages: Swedish and Danish sol, Icelandic s√≥l, etc.[18] The principal adjectives for the Sun in English are sunny for sunlight and, in technical contexts, solar (/Ààso äl…ôr/),[3] from Latin sol.[19] From the Greek helios comes the rare adjective heliac (/ÀàhiÀêli√¶k/).[20] In English, the Greek and Latin words occur in poetry as personifications of the Sun, Helios (/ÀàhiÀêli…ôs/) and Sol (/Ààs…íl/),[2][1] while in science fiction Sol may be used to distinguish the Sun from other stars. The term sol with a lowercase s is used by planetary astronomers for the duration of a solar day on another planet such as Mars.[21] The astronomical symbol for the Sun is a circle with a center dot, .[22] It is used for such units as M‚òâ (Solar mass), R‚òâ (Solar radius) and L‚òâ (Solar luminosity).[23][24] The scientific study of the Sun is called heliology.[25] The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star that makes up about 99.86% of the mass of the Solar System.[26] It has an absolute magnitude of +4.83, estimated to be brighter than about 85% of the stars in the Milky Way, most of which are red dwarfs.[27][28] It is more massive than 95% of the stars within 7 pc (23 ly).[29] The Sun is a Population I, or heavy-element-rich,[b] star.[30] Its formation approximately 4.6 billion years ago may have been triggered by shockwaves from one or more nearby supernovae.[31][32] This is suggested by a high abundance of heavy elements in the Solar System, such as gold and uranium, relative to the abundances of these elements in so-called Population II, heavy-element-poor, stars. The heavy elements could most plausibly have been produced by endothermic nuclear reactions during a supernova, or by transmutation through neutron absorption within a massive second-generation star.[30] The Sun is by far the brightest object in the Earth's sky, with an apparent magnitude of ‚àí26.74.[33][34] This is about 13 billion times brighter than the next brightest star, Sirius, which has an apparent magnitude of ‚àí1.46.[35] One astronomical unit (about 150 million kilometres; 93 million miles) is defined as the mean distance between the centers of the Sun and the Earth. The instantaneous distance varies by about ¬±2.5 million kilometres (1.6 million miles) as Earth moves from perihelion around 3 January to aphelion around 4 July.[36] At its average distance, light travels from the Sun's horizon to Earth's horizon in about 8 minutes and 20 seconds,[37] while light from the closest points of the Sun and Earth takes about two seconds less. The energy of this sunlight supports almost all life[c] on Earth by photosynthesis,[38] and drives Earth's climate and weather.[39] The Sun does not have a definite boundary, but its density decreases exponentially with increasing height above the photosphere.[40] For the purpose of measurement, the Sun's radius is considered to be the distance from its center to the edge of the photosphere, the apparent visible surface of the Sun.[41] The roundness of the Sun is relative difference between its radius at its equator, R eq {\\displaystyle R_{\\textrm {eq}}} , and at its pole, R pol {\\displaystyle R_{\\textrm {pol}}} , called the oblateness,[42] Œî ‚äô = ( R eq ‚àí R pol ) / R pol . {\\displaystyle \\Delta _{\\odot }=(R_{\\textrm {eq}}-R_{\\textrm {pol}})/R_{\\textrm {pol}}.} The value is difficult to measure. Atmospheric distortion means the measurement must be done on satellites; the value is very small meaning very precise technique is needed.[43] The oblateness was once proposed to be sufficient to explain the perihelion precession of Mercury but Einstein proposed that general relativity could explain the precession using a spherical Sun.[43] When high precision measurements of the oblateness became available via the Solar Dynamics Observatory[44] and the Picard satellite[42] the measured value was even smaller than expected,[43] 8.2 x 10-6, or 8 parts per million. This makes the Sun the natural object closest to a perfect sphere.[45] The oblateness value remains constant independent of solar irradiation changes.[42] The tidal effect of the planets is weak and does not significantly affect the shape of the Sun.[46] The Sun rotates faster at its equator than at its poles. This differential rotation is caused by convective motion due to heat transport and the Coriolis force due to the Sun's rotation. In a frame of reference defined by the stars, the rotational period is approximately 25.6 days at the equator and 33.5 days at the poles. Viewed from Earth as it orbits the Sun, the apparent rotational period of the Sun at its equator is about 28 days.[47] Viewed from a vantage point above its north pole, the Sun rotates counterclockwise around its axis of spin.[d][48] A survey of solar analogs suggest the early Sun was rotating up to ten times faster than it does today. This would have made the surface much more active, with greater X-ray and UV emission. Sun spots would have covered 5‚Äì30% of the surface.[49] The rotation rate was gradually slowed by magnetic braking, as the Sun's magnetic field interacted with the outflowing solar wind.[50] A vestige of this rapid primordial rotation still survives at the Sun's core, which has been found to be rotating at a rate of once per week; four times the mean surface rotation rate.[51][52] The Sun consists mainly of the elements hydrogen and helium. At this time in the Sun's life, they account for 74.9% and 23.8%, respectively, of the mass of the Sun in the photosphere.[53] All heavier elements, called metals in astronomy, account for less than 2% of the mass, with oxygen (roughly 1% of the Sun's mass), carbon (0.3%), neon (0.2%), and iron (0.2%) being the most abundant.[54] The Sun's original chemical composition was inherited from the interstellar medium out of which it formed. Originally it would have been about 71.1% hydrogen, 27.4% helium, and 1.5% heavier elements.[53] The hydrogen and most of the helium in the Sun would have been produced by Big Bang nucleosynthesis in the first 20 minutes of the universe, and the heavier elements were produced by previous generations of stars before the Sun was formed, and spread into the interstellar medium during the final stages of stellar life and by events such as supernovae.[55] Since the Sun formed, the main fusion process has involved fusing hydrogen into helium. Over the past 4.6 billion years, the amount of helium and its location within the Sun has gradually changed. The proportion of helium within the core has increased from about 24% to about 60% due to fusion, and some of the helium and heavy elements have settled from the photosphere toward the center of the Sun because of gravity. The proportions of heavier elements are unchanged. Heat is transferred outward from the Sun's core by radiation rather than by convection (see Radiative zone below), so the fusion products are not lifted outward by heat; they remain in the core,[56] and gradually an inner core of helium has begun to form that cannot be fused because presently the Sun's core is not hot or dense enough to fuse helium. In the current photosphere, the helium fraction is reduced, and the metallicity is only 84% of what it was in the protostellar phase (before nuclear fusion in the core started). In the future, helium will continue to accumulate in the core, and in about 5 billion years this gradual build-up will eventually cause the Sun to exit the main sequence and become a red giant.[57] The chemical composition of the photosphere is normally considered representative of the composition of the primordial Solar System.[58] Typically, the solar heavy-element abundances described above are measured both by using spectroscopy of the Sun's photosphere and by measuring abundances in meteorites that have never been heated to melting temperatures. These meteorites are thought to retain the composition of the protostellar Sun and are thus not affected by the settling of heavy elements. The two methods generally agree well.[59] The core of the Sun extends from the center to about 20‚Äì25% of the solar radius.[60] It has a density of up to 150 g/cm3[61][62] (about 150 times the density of water) and a temperature of close to 15.7 million kelvin (K).[62] By contrast, the Sun's surface temperature is about 5800 K. Recent analysis of SOHO mission data favors the idea that the core is rotating faster than the radiative zone outside it.[60] Through most of the Sun's life, energy has been produced by nuclear fusion in the core region through the proton‚Äìproton chain; this process converts hydrogen into helium.[63] Currently, 0.8% of the energy generated in the Sun comes from another sequence of fusion reactions called the CNO cycle; the proportion coming from the CNO cycle is expected to increase as the Sun becomes older and more luminous.[64][65] The core is the only region of the Sun that produces an appreciable amount of thermal energy through fusion; 99% of the Sun's power is generated in the innermost 24% of its radius, and almost no fusion occurs beyond 30% of the radius. The rest of the Sun is heated by this energy as it is transferred outward through many successive layers, finally to the solar photosphere where it escapes into space through radiation (photons) or advection (massive particles).[66][67] The proton‚Äìproton chain occurs around 9.2√ó1037 times each second in the core, converting about 3.7√ó1038 protons into alpha particles (helium nuclei) every second (out of a total of ~8.9√ó1056 free protons in the Sun), or about 6.2√ó1011 kg/s. However, each proton (on average) takes around 9 billion years to fuse with another using the PP chain.[66] Fusing four free protons (hydrogen nuclei) into a single alpha particle (helium nucleus) releases around 0.7% of the fused mass as energy,[68] so the Sun releases energy at the mass‚Äìenergy conversion rate of 4.26 billion kg/s (which requires 600 billion kg of hydrogen[69]), for 384.6 yottawatts (3.846√ó1026 W),[5] or 9.192√ó1010 megatons of TNT per second. The large power output of the Sun is mainly due to the huge size and density of its core (compared to Earth and objects on Earth), with only a fairly small amount of power being generated per cubic metre. Theoretical models of the Sun's interior indicate a maximum power density, or energy production, of approximately 276.5 watts per cubic metre at the center of the core,[70] which, according to Karl Kruszelnicki, is about the same power density inside a compost pile.[71] The fusion rate in the core is in a self-correcting equilibrium: a slightly higher rate of fusion would cause the core to heat up more and expand slightly against the weight of the outer layers, reducing the density and hence the fusion rate and correcting the perturbation; and a slightly lower rate would cause the core to cool and shrink slightly, increasing the density and increasing the fusion rate and again reverting it to its present rate.[72][73] The radiative zone is the thickest layer of the Sun, at 0.45 solar radii. From the core out to about 0.7 solar radii, thermal radiation is the primary means of energy transfer.[74] The temperature drops from approximately 7 million to 2 million kelvins with increasing distance from the core.[62] This temperature gradient is less than the value of the adiabatic lapse rate and hence cannot drive convection, which explains why the transfer of energy through this zone is by radiation instead of thermal convection.[62] Ions of hydrogen and helium emit photons, which travel only a brief distance before being reabsorbed by other ions.[74] The density drops a hundredfold (from 20,000 kg/m3 to 200 kg/m3) between 0.25 solar radii and 0.7 radii, the top of the radiative zone.[74] The radiative zone and the convective zone are separated by a transition layer, the tachocline. This is a region where the sharp regime change between the uniform rotation of the radiative zone and the differential rotation of the convection zone results in a large shear between the two‚Äîa condition where successive horizontal layers slide past one another.[75] Presently, it is hypothesized that a magnetic dynamo, or solar dynamo, within this layer generates the Sun's magnetic field.[62] The Sun's convection zone extends from 0.7 solar radii (500,000 km) to near the surface. In this layer, the solar plasma is not dense or hot enough to transfer the heat energy of the interior outward via radiation. Instead, the density of the plasma is low enough to allow convective currents to develop and move the Sun's energy outward towards its surface. Material heated at the tachocline picks up heat and expands, thereby reducing its density and allowing it to rise. As a result, an orderly motion of the mass develops into thermal cells that carry most of the heat outward to the Sun's photosphere above. Once the material diffusively and radiatively cools just beneath the photospheric surface, its density increases, and it sinks to the base of the convection zone, where it again picks up heat from the top of the radiative zone and the convective cycle continues. At the photosphere, the temperature has dropped 350-fold to 5,700 K (9,800 ¬∞F) and the density to only 0.2 g/m3 (about 1/10,000 the density of air at sea level, and 1 millionth that of the inner layer of the convective zone).[62] The thermal columns of the convection zone form an imprint on the surface of the Sun giving it a granular appearance called the solar granulation at the smallest scale and supergranulation at larger scales. Turbulent convection in this outer part of the solar interior sustains \"small-scale\" dynamo action over the near-surface volume of the Sun.[62] The Sun's thermal columns are B√©nard cells and take the shape of roughly hexagonal prisms.[76] The visible surface of the Sun, the photosphere, is the layer below which the Sun becomes opaque to visible light.[77] Photons produced in this layer escape the Sun through the transparent solar atmosphere above it and become solar radiation, sunlight. The change in opacity is due to the decreasing amount of H‚àí ions, which absorb visible light easily.[77] Conversely, the visible light perceived is produced as electrons react with hydrogen atoms to produce H‚àí ions.[78][79] The photosphere is tens to hundreds of kilometers thick, and is slightly less opaque than air on Earth. Because the upper part of the photosphere is cooler than the lower part, an image of the Sun appears brighter in the center than on the edge or limb of the solar disk, in a phenomenon known as limb darkening.[77] The spectrum of sunlight has approximately the spectrum of a black-body radiating at 5,772 K (9,930 ¬∞F),[12] interspersed with atomic absorption lines from the tenuous layers above the photosphere. The photosphere has a particle density of ~1023 m‚àí3 (about 0.37% of the particle number per volume of Earth's atmosphere at sea level). The photosphere is not fully ionized‚Äîthe extent of ionization is about 3%, leaving almost all of the hydrogen in atomic form.[80] The Sun's atmosphere is composed of five layers: the photosphere, the chromosphere, the transition region, the corona, and the heliosphere. The coolest layer of the Sun is a temperature minimum region extending to about 500 km above the photosphere, and has a temperature of about 4,100 K.[77] This part of the Sun is cool enough to allow for the existence of simple molecules such as carbon monoxide and water.[81] The chromosphere, transition region, and corona are much hotter than the surface of the Sun.[77] The reason is not well understood, but evidence suggests that Alfv√©n waves may have enough energy to heat the corona.[82] Above the temperature minimum layer is a layer about 2,000 km thick, dominated by a spectrum of emission and absorption lines.[77] It is called the chromosphere from the Greek root chroma, meaning color, because the chromosphere is visible as a colored flash at the beginning and end of total solar eclipses.[74] The temperature of the chromosphere increases gradually with altitude, ranging up to around 20,000 K near the top.[77] In the upper part of the chromosphere helium becomes partially ionized.[83] Above the chromosphere, in a thin (about 200 km) transition region, the temperature rises rapidly from around 20,000 K in the upper chromosphere to coronal temperatures closer to 1,000,000 K.[84] The temperature increase is facilitated by the full ionization of helium in the transition region, which significantly reduces radiative cooling of the plasma.[83] The transition region does not occur at a well-defined altitude, but forms a kind of nimbus around chromospheric features such as spicules and filaments, and is in constant, chaotic motion.[74] The transition region is not easily visible from Earth's surface, but is readily observable from space by instruments sensitive to extreme ultraviolet.[85] The corona is the next layer of the Sun. The low corona, near the surface of the Sun, has a particle density around 1015 m‚àí3 to 1016 m‚àí3.[83][e] The average temperature of the corona and solar wind is about 1,000,000‚Äì2,000,000 K; however, in the hottest regions it is 8,000,000‚Äì20,000,000 K.[84] Although no complete theory yet exists to account for the temperature of the corona, at least some of its heat is known to be from magnetic reconnection.[84][86] The corona is the extended atmosphere of the Sun, which has a volume much larger than the volume enclosed by the Sun's photosphere. A flow of plasma outward from the Sun into interplanetary space is the solar wind.[86] The heliosphere, the tenuous outermost atmosphere of the Sun, is filled with solar wind plasma and is defined to begin at the distance where the flow of the solar wind becomes superalfv√©nic‚Äîthat is, where the flow becomes faster than the speed of Alfv√©n waves,[87] at approximately 20 solar radii (0.1 AU). Turbulence and dynamic forces in the heliosphere cannot affect the shape of the solar corona within, because the information can only travel at the speed of Alfv√©n waves. The solar wind travels outward continuously through the heliosphere,[88][89] forming the solar magnetic field into a spiral shape,[86] until it impacts the heliopause more than 50 AU from the Sun. In December 2004, the Voyager 1 probe passed through a shock front that is thought to be part of the heliopause.[90] In late 2012, Voyager 1 recorded a marked increase in cosmic ray collisions and a sharp drop in lower energy particles from the solar wind, which suggested that the probe had passed through the heliopause and entered the interstellar medium,[91] and indeed did so on August 25, 2012, at approximately 122 astronomical units (18 Tm) from the Sun.[92] The heliosphere has a heliotail which stretches out behind it due to the Sun's peculiar motion through the galaxy.[93] On April 28, 2021, NASA's Parker Solar Probe encountered the specific magnetic and particle conditions at 18.8 solar radii that indicated that it penetrated the Alfv√©n surface, the boundary separating the corona from the solar wind, defined as where the coronal plasma's Alfv√©n speed and the large-scale solar wind speed are equal.[94][95] During the flyby, Parker Solar Probe passed into and out of the corona several times. This proved the predictions that the Alfv√©n critical surface is not shaped like a smooth ball, but has spikes and valleys that wrinkle its surface.[94] The Sun emits light across the visible spectrum, so its color is white, with a CIE color-space index near (0.3, 0.3), when viewed from space or when the Sun is high in the sky. The Solar radiance per wavelength peaks in the green portion of the spectrum when viewed from space.[96][97] When the Sun is very low in the sky, atmospheric scattering renders the Sun yellow, red, orange, or magenta, and in rare occasions even green or blue. Some cultures mentally picture the Sun as yellow and some even red; the cultural reasons for this are debated.[98] The Sun is classed as a G2 star,[66] meaning it is a G-type star, with 2 indicating its surface temperature is in the second range of the G class. The solar constant is the amount of power that the Sun deposits per unit area that is directly exposed to sunlight. The solar constant is equal to approximately 1,368 W/m2 (watts per square meter) at a distance of one astronomical unit (AU) from the Sun (that is, at or near Earth's orbit).[99] Sunlight on the surface of Earth is attenuated by Earth's atmosphere, so that less power arrives at the surface (closer to 1,000 W/m2) in clear conditions when the Sun is near the zenith.[100] Sunlight at the top of Earth's atmosphere is composed (by total energy) of about 50% infrared light, 40% visible light, and 10% ultraviolet light.[101] The atmosphere filters out over 70% of solar ultraviolet, especially at the shorter wavelengths.[102] Solar ultraviolet radiation ionizes Earth's dayside upper atmosphere, creating the electrically conducting ionosphere.[103] Ultraviolet light from the Sun has antiseptic properties and can be used to sanitize tools and water. This radiation causes sunburn, and has other biological effects such as the production of vitamin D and sun tanning. It is the main cause of skin cancer. Ultraviolet light is strongly attenuated by Earth's ozone layer, so that the amount of UV varies greatly with latitude and has been partially responsible for many biological adaptations, including variations in human skin color.[104] High-energy gamma ray photons initially released with fusion reactions in the core are almost immediately absorbed by the solar plasma of the radiative zone, usually after traveling only a few millimeters. Re-emission happens in a random direction and usually at slightly lower energy. With this sequence of emissions and absorptions, it takes a long time for radiation to reach the Sun's surface. Estimates of the photon travel time range between 10,000 and 170,000 years.[105] In contrast, it takes only 2.3 seconds for neutrinos, which account for about 2% of the total energy production of the Sun, to reach the surface. Because energy transport in the Sun is a process that involves photons in thermodynamic equilibrium with matter, the time scale of energy transport in the Sun is longer, on the order of 30,000,000 years. This is the time it would take the Sun to return to a stable state if the rate of energy generation in its core were suddenly changed.[106] Electron neutrinos are released by fusion reactions in the core, but, unlike photons, they rarely interact with matter, so almost all are able to escape the Sun immediately. However, measurements of the number of these neutrinos produced in the Sun are lower than theories predict by a factor of 3. In 2001, the discovery of neutrino oscillation resolved the discrepancy: the Sun emits the number of electron neutrinos predicted by the theory, but neutrino detectors were missing 2‚ÅÑ3 of them because the neutrinos had changed flavor by the time they were detected.[107] The Sun has a stellar magnetic field that varies across its surface. Its polar field is 1‚Äì2 gauss (0.0001‚Äì0.0002 T), whereas the field is typically 3,000 gauss (0.3 T) in features on the Sun called sunspots and 10‚Äì100 gauss (0.001‚Äì0.01 T) in solar prominences.[5] The magnetic field varies in time and location. The quasi-periodic 11-year solar cycle is the most prominent variation in which the number and size of sunspots waxes and wanes.[108][109][110] The solar magnetic field extends well beyond the Sun itself. The electrically conducting solar wind plasma carries the Sun's magnetic field into space, forming what is called the interplanetary magnetic field.[86] In an approximation known as ideal magnetohydrodynamics, plasma particles only move along magnetic field lines. As a result, the outward-flowing solar wind stretches the interplanetary magnetic field outward, forcing it into a roughly radial structure. For a simple dipolar solar magnetic field, with opposite hemispherical polarities on either side of the solar magnetic equator, a thin current sheet is formed in the solar wind. At great distances, the rotation of the Sun twists the dipolar magnetic field and corresponding current sheet into an Archimedean spiral structure called the Parker spiral.[86] Sunspots are visible as dark patches on the Sun's photosphere and correspond to concentrations of magnetic field where convective transport of heat is inhibited from the solar interior to the surface. As a result, sunspots are slightly cooler than the surrounding photosphere, so they appear dark. At a typical solar minimum, few sunspots are visible, and occasionally none can be seen at all. Those that do appear are at high solar latitudes. As the solar cycle progresses toward its maximum, sunspots tend to form closer to the solar equator, a phenomenon known as Sp√∂rer's law. The largest sunspots can be tens of thousands of kilometers across.[111] An 11-year sunspot cycle is half of a 22-year Babcock‚ÄìLeighton dynamo cycle, which corresponds to an oscillatory exchange of energy between toroidal and poloidal solar magnetic fields. At solar-cycle maximum, the external poloidal dipolar magnetic field is near its dynamo-cycle minimum strength; but an internal toroidal quadrupolar field, generated through differential rotation within the tachocline, is near its maximum strength. At this point in the dynamo cycle, buoyant upwelling within the convective zone forces emergence of the toroidal magnetic field through the photosphere, giving rise to pairs of sunspots, roughly aligned east‚Äìwest and having footprints with opposite magnetic polarities. The magnetic polarity of sunspot pairs alternates every solar cycle, a phenomenon described by Hale's law.[112][113] During the solar cycle's declining phase, energy shifts from the internal toroidal magnetic field to the external poloidal field, and sunspots diminish in number and size. At solar-cycle minimum, the toroidal field is, correspondingly, at minimum strength, sunspots are relatively rare, and the poloidal field is at its maximum strength. With the rise of the next 11-year sunspot cycle, differential rotation shifts magnetic energy back from the poloidal to the toroidal field, but with a polarity that is opposite to the previous cycle. The process carries on continuously, and in an idealized, simplified scenario, each 11-year sunspot cycle corresponds to a change, then, in the overall polarity of the Sun's large-scale magnetic field.[114][115] The Sun's magnetic field leads to many effects that are collectively called solar activity. Solar flares and coronal mass ejections tend to occur at sunspot groups. Slowly changing high-speed streams of solar wind are emitted from coronal holes at the photospheric surface. Both coronal mass ejections and high-speed streams of solar wind carry plasma and the interplanetary magnetic field outward into the Solar System.[116] The effects of solar activity on Earth include auroras at moderate to high latitudes and the disruption of radio communications and electric power. Solar activity is thought to have played a large role in the formation and evolution of the Solar System.[117] Change in solar irradiance over the 11 year solar cycle has been correlated with change in sunspot number.[118] The solar cycle influences space weather conditions, including those surrounding Earth. For example, in the 17th century, the solar cycle appeared to have stopped entirely for several decades; few sunspots were observed during a period known as the Maunder minimum. This coincided in time with the era of the Little Ice Age, when Europe experienced unusually cold temperatures.[119] [120] Earlier extended minima have been discovered through analysis of tree rings and appear to have coincided with lower-than-average global temperatures.[121] The temperature of the photosphere is approximately 6,000 K, whereas the temperature of the corona reaches 1,000,000‚Äì2,000,000 K.[84] The high temperature of the corona shows that it is heated by something other than direct heat conduction from the photosphere.[86] It is thought that the energy necessary to heat the corona is provided by turbulent motion in the convection zone below the photosphere, and two main mechanisms have been proposed to explain coronal heating.[84] The first is wave heating, in which sound, gravitational or magnetohydrodynamic waves are produced by turbulence in the convection zone.[84] These waves travel upward and dissipate in the corona, depositing their energy in the ambient matter in the form of heat.[122] The other is magnetic heating, in which magnetic energy is continuously built up by photospheric motion and released through magnetic reconnection in the form of large solar flares and myriad similar but smaller events‚Äînanoflares.[123] Currently, it is unclear whether waves are an efficient heating mechanism. All waves except Alfv√©n waves have been found to dissipate or refract before reaching the corona.[124] In addition, Alfv√©n waves do not easily dissipate in the corona. Current research focus has therefore shifted towards flare heating mechanisms.[84] The Sun today is roughly halfway through the main-sequence portion of its life. It has not changed dramatically in over four billion[a] years and will remain fairly stable for about five billion more. However, after hydrogen fusion in its core has stopped, the Sun will undergo dramatic changes, both internally and externally. The Sun formed about 4.6 billion years ago from the collapse of part of a giant molecular cloud that consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium and that probably gave birth to many other stars.[125] This age is estimated using computer models of stellar evolution and through nucleocosmochronology.[13] The result is consistent with the radiometric date of the oldest Solar System material, at 4.567 billion years ago.[126][127] Studies of ancient meteorites reveal traces of stable daughter nuclei of short-lived isotopes, such as iron-60, that form only in exploding, short-lived stars. This indicates that one or more supernovae must have occurred near the location where the Sun formed. A shock wave from a nearby supernova would have triggered the formation of the Sun by compressing the matter within the molecular cloud and causing certain regions to collapse under their own gravity.[128] As one fragment of the cloud collapsed it also began to rotate due to conservation of angular momentum and heat up with the increasing pressure.[129] Much of the mass became concentrated in the center, whereas the rest flattened out into a disk that would become the planets and other Solar System bodies.[130][131] Gravity and pressure within the core of the cloud generated a lot of heat as it accumulated more matter from the surrounding disk, eventually triggering nuclear fusion.[132] The stars HD 162826 and HD 186302 share similarities with the Sun and are thus hypothesized to be its stellar siblings, formed in the same molecular cloud.[133][134] The Sun is about halfway through its main-sequence stage, during which nuclear fusion reactions in its core fuse hydrogen into helium. Each second, more than four billion kilograms of matter are converted into energy within the Sun's core, producing neutrinos and solar radiation. At this rate, the Sun has so far converted around 100 times the mass of Earth into energy, about 0.03% of the total mass of the Sun. The Sun will spend a total of approximately 10 to 11 billion years as a main-sequence star before the red giant phase of the Sun.[135] At the 8 billion year mark, the Sun will be at its hottest point according to the ESA's Gaia space observatory mission in 2022.[136] The Sun is gradually becoming hotter in its core, hotter at the surface, larger in radius, and more luminous during its time on the main sequence: since the beginning of its main sequence life, it has expanded in radius by 15% and the surface has increased in temperature from 5,620 K (9,660 ¬∞F) to 5,772 K (9,930 ¬∞F), resulting in a 48% increase in luminosity from 0.677 solar luminosities to its present-day 1.0 solar luminosity. This occurs because the helium atoms in the core have a higher mean molecular weight than the hydrogen atoms that were fused, resulting in less thermal pressure. The core is therefore shrinking, allowing the outer layers of the Sun to move closer to the center, releasing gravitational potential energy. According to the virial theorem, half of this released gravitational energy goes into heating, which leads to a gradual increase in the rate at which fusion occurs and thus an increase in the luminosity. This process speeds up as the core gradually becomes denser.[137] At present, it is increasing in brightness by about 1% every 100 million years. It will take at least 1 billion years from now to deplete liquid water from the Earth from such increase.[138] After that, the Earth will cease to be able to support complex, multicellular life and the last remaining multicellular organisms on the planet will suffer a final, complete mass extinction.[139] The Sun does not have enough mass to explode as a supernova. Instead, when it runs out of hydrogen in the core in approximately 5 billion years, core hydrogen fusion will stop, and there will be nothing to prevent the core from contracting. The release of gravitational potential energy will cause the luminosity of the Sun to increase, ending the main sequence phase and leading the Sun to expand over the next billion years: first into a subgiant, and then into a red giant.[137][140][141] The heating due to gravitational contraction will also lead to expansion of the Sun and hydrogen fusion in a shell just outside the core, where unfused hydrogen remains, contributing to the increased luminosity, which will eventually reach more than 1,000 times its present luminosity.[137] When the Sun enters its red-giant branch (RGB) phase, it will engulf (and very likely destroy) Mercury and Venus. According to a 2008 article, Earth's orbit will have initially expanded to at most 1.5 AU (220 million km; 140 million mi) due to the Sun's loss of mass. However, Earth's orbit will then start shrinking due to tidal forces (and, eventually, drag from the lower chromosphere) so that it is engulfed by the Sun during the tip of the red-giant branch phase 7.59 billion years from now, 3.8 and 1 million years after Mercury and Venus have respectively suffered the same fate.[141] By the time the Sun reaches the tip of the red-giant branch, it will be about 256 times larger than it is today, with a radius of 1.19 AU (178 million km; 111 million mi).[141][142] The Sun will spend around a billion years in the RGB and lose around a third of its mass.[141] After the red-giant branch, the Sun has approximately 120 million years of active life left, but much happens. First, the core (full of degenerate helium) ignites violently in the helium flash; it is estimated that 6% of the core‚Äîitself 40% of the Sun's mass‚Äîwill be converted into carbon within a matter of minutes through the triple-alpha process.[143] The Sun then shrinks to around 10 times its current size and 50 times the luminosity, with a temperature a little lower than today. It will then have reached the red clump or horizontal branch, but a star of the Sun's metallicity does not evolve blueward along the horizontal branch. Instead, it just becomes moderately larger and more luminous over about 100 million years as it continues to react helium in the core.[141] When the helium is exhausted, the Sun will repeat the expansion it followed when the hydrogen in the core was exhausted. This time, however, it all happens faster, and the Sun becomes larger and more luminous. This is the asymptotic-giant-branch phase, and the Sun is alternately reacting hydrogen in a shell or helium in a deeper shell. After about 20 million years on the early asymptotic giant branch, the Sun becomes increasingly unstable, with rapid mass loss and thermal pulses that increase the size and luminosity for a few hundred years every 100,000 years or so. The thermal pulses become larger each time, with the later pulses pushing the luminosity to as much as 5,000 times the current level. Despite this, the Sun's maximum AGB radius will not be as large as its tip-RGB maximum: 179 R‚òâ, or about 0.832 AU (124.5 million km; 77.3 million mi).[141][144] Models vary depending on the rate and timing of mass loss. Models that have higher mass loss on the red-giant branch produce smaller, less luminous stars at the tip of the asymptotic giant branch, perhaps only 2,000 times the luminosity and less than 200 times the radius.[141] For the Sun, four thermal pulses are predicted before it completely loses its outer envelope and starts to make a planetary nebula.[145] The post-asymptotic-giant-branch evolution is even faster. The luminosity stays approximately constant as the temperature increases, with the ejected half of the Sun's mass becoming ionized into a planetary nebula as the exposed core reaches 30,000 K (53,500 ¬∞F), as if it is in a sort of blue loop. The final naked core, a white dwarf, will have a temperature of over 100,000 K (180,000 ¬∞F) and contain an estimated 54.05% of the Sun's present-day mass.[141] Simulations indicate that the Sun may be among the least massive stars capable of forming a planetary nebula.[146] The planetary nebula will disperse in about 10,000 years, but the white dwarf will survive for trillions of years before fading to a hypothetical super-dense black dwarf.[147][148][149] As such, it would give off no more energy.[150] The Sun has eight known planets orbiting it. This includes four terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars), two gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn), and two ice giants (Uranus and Neptune). The Solar System also has nine bodies generally considered as dwarf planets and some more candidates, an asteroid belt, numerous comets, and a large number of icy bodies which lie beyond the orbit of Neptune. Six of the planets and many smaller bodies also have their own natural satellites: in particular, the satellite systems of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus are in some ways like miniature versions of the Sun's system.[151] The Sun is moved by the gravitational pull of the planets. The center of the Sun moves around the Solar System barycenter, within a range from 0.1 to 2.2 solar radii. The Sun's motion around the barycenter approximately repeats every 179 years, rotated by about 30¬∞ due primarily to the synodic period of Jupiter and Saturn.[152] The Sun's gravitational field is estimated to dominate the gravitational forces of surrounding stars out to about two light-years (125,000 AU). Lower estimates for the radius of the Oort cloud, by contrast, do not place it farther than 50,000 AU.[153] Most of the mass is orbiting in the region between 3,000 and 100,000 AU.[154] The furthest known objects, such as Comet West, have aphelia around 70,000 AU from the Sun.[155] The Sun's Hill sphere with respect to the galactic nucleus, the effective range of its gravitational influence, was calculated by G. A. Chebotarev to be 230,000 AU.[156] Within 10 light-years of the Sun there are relatively few stars, the closest being the triple star system Alpha Centauri, which is about 4.4 light-years away and may be in the Local Bubble's G-Cloud.[158] Alpha Centauri A and B are a closely tied pair of Sun-like stars, whereas the closest star to the Sun, the small red dwarf Proxima Centauri, orbits the pair at a distance of 0.2 light-years. In 2016, a potentially habitable exoplanet was found to be orbiting Proxima Centauri, called Proxima Centauri b, the closest confirmed exoplanet to the Sun.[159] The Solar System is surrounded by the Local Interstellar Cloud, although it is not clear if it is embedded in the Local Interstellar Cloud or if it lies just outside the cloud's edge.[160] Multiple other interstellar clouds exist in the region within 300 light-years of the Sun, known as the Local Bubble.[160] The latter feature is an hourglass-shaped cavity or superbubble in the interstellar medium roughly 300 light-years across. The bubble is suffused with high-temperature plasma, suggesting that it may be the product of several recent supernovae.[161] The Local Bubble is a small superbubble compared to the neighboring wider Radcliffe Wave and Split linear structures (formerly Gould Belt), each of which are some thousands of light-years in length.[162] All these structures are part of the Orion Arm, which contains most of the stars in the Milky Way that are visible to the unaided eye.[163] Groups of stars form together in star clusters, before dissolving into co-moving associations. A prominent grouping that is visible to the naked eye is the Ursa Major moving group, which is around 80 light-years away within the Local Bubble. The nearest star cluster is Hyades, which lies at the edge of the Local Bubble. The closest star-forming regions are the Corona Australis Molecular Cloud, the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex and the Taurus molecular cloud; the latter lies just beyond the Local Bubble and is part of the Radcliffe wave.[164] The Sun, taking along the whole Solar System, orbits the galaxy's center of mass at an average speed of 230 km/s (828,000 km/h) or 143 mi/s (514,000 mph),[167] taking about 220‚Äì250 million Earth years to complete a revolution (a Galactic year),[168] having done so about 20 times since the Sun's formation.[169][170] The direction of the Sun's motion, the Solar apex, is roughly in the direction of the star Vega.[171] The Milky Way is moving with respect to the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) in the direction of the constellation Hydra with a speed of 550 km/s. Since the Sun is moving with respect to the galactic center in the direction of Cygnus (galactic longitude 90¬∞; latitude 0¬∞) at more than 200 km/sec, the resultant velocity with respect to the CMB is about 370 km/s in the direction of Crater or Leo (galactic latitude 264¬∞, latitude 48¬∞).[172] In many prehistoric and ancient cultures, the Sun was thought to be a solar deity or other supernatural entity.[173][174] In the early first millennium BC, Babylonian astronomers observed that the Sun's motion along the ecliptic is not uniform, though they did not know why; it is today known that this is due to the movement of Earth in an elliptic orbit, moving faster when it is nearer to the Sun at perihelion and moving slower when it is farther away at aphelion.[175] One of the first people to offer a scientific or philosophical explanation for the Sun was the Greek philosopher Anaxagoras. He reasoned that it was a giant flaming ball of metal even larger than the land of the Peloponnesus and that the Moon reflected the light of the Sun.[176] Eratosthenes estimated the distance between Earth and the Sun in the third century BC as \"of stadia myriads 400 and 80000\", the translation of which is ambiguous, implying either 4,080,000 stadia (755,000 km) or 804,000,000 stadia (148 to 153 million kilometers or 0.99 to 1.02 AU); the latter value is correct to within a few percent. In the first century AD, Ptolemy estimated the distance as 1,210 times the radius of Earth, approximately 7.71 million kilometers (0.0515 AU).[177] The theory that the Sun is the center around which the planets orbit was first proposed by the ancient Greek Aristarchus of Samos in the third century BC,[178] and later adopted by Seleucus of Seleucia (see Heliocentrism).[179] This view was developed in a more detailed mathematical model of a heliocentric system in the 16th century by Nicolaus Copernicus.[180] Observations of sunspots were recorded during the Han dynasty (206 BC‚ÄìAD 220) by Chinese astronomers, who maintained records of these observations for centuries. Averroes also provided a description of sunspots in the 12th century.[181] The invention of the telescope in the early 17th century permitted detailed observations of sunspots by Thomas Harriot, Galileo Galilei and other astronomers. Galileo posited that sunspots were on the surface of the Sun rather than small objects passing between Earth and the Sun.[182] Arabic astronomical contributions include Al-Battani's discovery that the direction of the Sun's apogee (the place in the Sun's orbit against the fixed stars where it seems to be moving slowest) is changing.[183] In modern heliocentric terms, this is caused by a gradual motion of the aphelion of the Earth's orbit. Ibn Yunus observed more than 10,000 entries for the Sun's position for many years using a large astrolabe.[184] From an observation of a transit of Venus in 1032, the Persian astronomer and polymath Ibn Sina concluded that Venus was closer to Earth than the Sun.[185] In 1677, Edmond Halley observed a transit of Mercury across the Sun, leading him to realize that observations of the solar parallax of a planet (more ideally using the transit of Venus) could be used to trigonometrically determine the distances between Earth, Venus, and the Sun.[186] Careful observations of the 1769 transit of Venus allowed astronomers to calculate the average Earth‚ÄìSun distance as 93,726,900 miles (150,838,800 km), only 0.8% greater than the modern value.[187] In 1666, Isaac Newton observed the Sun's light using a prism, and showed that it is made up of light of many colors.[188] In 1800, William Herschel discovered infrared radiation beyond the red part of the solar spectrum.[189] The 19th century saw advancement in spectroscopic studies of the Sun; Joseph von Fraunhofer recorded more than 600 absorption lines in the spectrum, the strongest of which are still often referred to as Fraunhofer lines. The 20th century brought about several specialized systems for observing the Sun, especially at different narrowband wavelengths, such as those using Calcium H (396.9 nm), K (393.37 nm) and Hydrogen-alpha (656.46 nm) filtering.[190] During early studies of the optical spectrum of the photosphere, some absorption lines were found that did not correspond to any chemical elements then known on Earth. In 1868, Norman Lockyer hypothesized that these absorption lines were caused by a new element that he dubbed helium, after the Greek Sun god Helios. Twenty-five years later, helium was isolated on Earth.[191] In the early years of the modern scientific era, the source of the Sun's energy was a significant puzzle. Lord Kelvin suggested that the Sun is a gradually cooling liquid body that is radiating an internal store of heat.[192] Kelvin and Hermann von Helmholtz then proposed a gravitational contraction mechanism to explain the energy output, but the resulting age estimate was only 20 million years, well short of the time span of at least 300 million years suggested by some geological discoveries of that time.[192][193] In 1890, Lockyer proposed a meteoritic hypothesis for the formation and evolution of the Sun.[194] Not until 1904 was a documented solution offered. Ernest Rutherford suggested that the Sun's output could be maintained by an internal source of heat, and suggested radioactive decay as the source.[195] However, it would be Albert Einstein who would provide the essential clue to the source of the Sun's energy output with his mass‚Äìenergy equivalence relation E = mc2.[196] In 1920, Sir Arthur Eddington proposed that the pressures and temperatures at the core of the Sun could produce a nuclear fusion reaction that merged hydrogen (protons) into helium nuclei, resulting in a production of energy from the net change in mass.[197] The preponderance of hydrogen in the Sun was confirmed in 1925 by Cecilia Payne using the ionization theory developed by Meghnad Saha. The theoretical concept of fusion was developed in the 1930s by the astrophysicists Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar and Hans Bethe. Hans Bethe calculated the details of the two main energy-producing nuclear reactions that power the Sun.[198][199] In 1957, Margaret Burbidge, Geoffrey Burbidge, William Fowler and Fred Hoyle showed that most of the elements in the universe have been synthesized by nuclear reactions inside stars, some like the Sun.[200] The first satellites designed for long term observation of the Sun from interplanetary space were NASA's Pioneers 6, 7, 8 and 9, which were launched between 1959 and 1968. These probes orbited the Sun at a distance similar to that of Earth, and made the first detailed measurements of the solar wind and the solar magnetic field. Pioneer 9 operated for a particularly long time, transmitting data until May 1983.[201][202] In the 1970s, two Helios spacecraft and the Skylab Apollo Telescope Mount provided scientists with significant new data on solar wind and the solar corona. The Helios 1 and 2 probes were U.S.‚ÄìGerman collaborations that studied the solar wind from an orbit carrying the spacecraft inside Mercury's orbit at perihelion.[203] The Skylab space station, launched by NASA in 1973, included a solar observatory module called the Apollo Telescope Mount that was operated by astronauts resident on the station.[85] Skylab made the first time-resolved observations of the solar transition region and of ultraviolet emissions from the solar corona.[85] Discoveries included the first observations of coronal mass ejections, then called \"coronal transients\", and of coronal holes, now known to be intimately associated with the solar wind.[203] In 1980, the Solar Maximum Mission probes were launched by NASA. This spacecraft was designed to observe gamma rays, X-rays and UV radiation from solar flares during a time of high solar activity and solar luminosity. Just a few months after launch, however, an electronics failure caused the probe to go into standby mode, and it spent the next three years in this inactive state. In 1984, Space Shuttle Challenger mission STS-41C retrieved the satellite and repaired its electronics before re-releasing it into orbit. The Solar Maximum Mission subsequently acquired thousands of images of the solar corona before re-entering Earth's atmosphere in June 1989.[204] Launched in 1991, Japan's Yohkoh (Sunbeam) satellite observed solar flares at X-ray wavelengths. Mission data allowed scientists to identify several different types of flares and demonstrated that the corona away from regions of peak activity was much more dynamic and active than had previously been supposed. Yohkoh observed an entire solar cycle but went into standby mode when an annular eclipse in 2001 caused it to lose its lock on the Sun. It was destroyed by atmospheric re-entry in 2005.[205] The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, jointly built by the European Space Agency and NASA, was launched on 2 December 1995.[85] Originally intended to serve a two-year mission,[206] SOHO remains in operation as of 2024.[207] Situated at the Lagrangian point between Earth and the Sun (at which the gravitational pull from both is equal), SOHO has provided a constant view of the Sun at many wavelengths since its launch.[85] Besides its direct solar observation, SOHO has enabled the discovery of a large number of comets, mostly tiny sungrazing comets that incinerate as they pass the Sun.[208] All these satellites have observed the Sun from the plane of the ecliptic, and so have only observed its equatorial regions in detail. The Ulysses probe was launched in 1990 to study the Sun's polar regions. It first traveled to Jupiter, to \"slingshot\" into an orbit that would take it far above the plane of the ecliptic. Once Ulysses was in its scheduled orbit, it began observing the solar wind and magnetic field strength at high solar latitudes, finding that the solar wind from high latitudes was moving at about 750 km/s, which was slower than expected, and that there were large magnetic waves emerging from high latitudes that scattered galactic cosmic rays.[209] Elemental abundances in the photosphere are well known from spectroscopic studies, but the composition of the interior of the Sun is more poorly understood. A solar wind sample return mission, Genesis, was designed to allow astronomers to directly measure the composition of solar material.[210] The brightness of the Sun can cause pain from looking at it with the naked eye; however, doing so for brief periods is not hazardous for normal non-dilated eyes.[211][212] Looking directly at the Sun (sungazing) causes phosphene visual artifacts and temporary partial blindness. It also delivers about 4 milliwatts of sunlight to the retina, slightly heating it and potentially causing damage in eyes that cannot respond properly to the brightness.[213][214] Viewing of the direct Sun with the naked eye can cause UV-induced, sunburn-like lesions on the retina beginning after about 100 seconds, particularly under conditions where the UV light from the Sun is intense and well focused.[215][216] Viewing the Sun through light-concentrating optics such as binoculars may result in permanent damage to the retina without an appropriate filter that blocks UV and substantially dims the sunlight. When using an attenuating filter to view the Sun, the viewer is cautioned to use a filter specifically designed for that use. Some improvised filters that pass UV or IR rays, can actually harm the eye at high brightness levels.[217] Brief glances at the midday Sun through an unfiltered telescope can cause permanent damage.[218] During sunrise and sunset, sunlight is attenuated because of Rayleigh scattering and Mie scattering from a particularly long passage through Earth's atmosphere,[219] and the Sun is sometimes faint enough to be viewed comfortably with the naked eye or safely with optics (provided there is no risk of bright sunlight suddenly appearing through a break between clouds). Hazy conditions, atmospheric dust, and high humidity contribute to this atmospheric attenuation.[220] An optical phenomenon, known as a green flash, can sometimes be seen shortly after sunset or before sunrise. The flash is caused by light from the Sun just below the horizon being bent (usually through a temperature inversion) towards the observer. Light of shorter wavelengths (violet, blue, green) is bent more than that of longer wavelengths (yellow, orange, red) but the violet and blue light is scattered more, leaving light that is perceived as green.[221] Solar deities play a major role in many world religions and mythologies.[222] Worship of the Sun was central to civilizations such as the ancient Egyptians, the Inca of South America and the Aztecs of what is now Mexico. In religions such as Hinduism, the Sun is still considered a god, known as Surya. Many ancient monuments were constructed with solar phenomena in mind; for example, stone megaliths accurately mark the summer or winter solstice (for example in Nabta Playa, Egypt; Mnajdra, Malta; and Stonehenge, England); Newgrange, a prehistoric human-built mount in Ireland, was designed to detect the winter solstice; the pyramid of El Castillo at Chich√©n Itz√° in Mexico is designed to cast shadows in the shape of serpents climbing the pyramid at the vernal and autumnal equinoxes.[223] The ancient Sumerians believed that the Sun was Utu,[224][225] the god of justice and twin brother of Inanna, the Queen of Heaven,[224] who was identified as the planet Venus.[225] Later, Utu was identified with the East Semitic god Shamash.[224][225] Utu was regarded as a helper-deity, who aided those in distress.[224] From at least the Fourth Dynasty of Ancient Egypt, the Sun was worshipped as the god Ra, portrayed as a falcon-headed divinity surmounted by the solar disk, and surrounded by a serpent. In the New Empire period, the Sun became identified with the dung beetle. In the form of the sun disc Aten, the Sun had a brief resurgence during the Amarna Period when it again became the preeminent, if not only, divinity for the Pharaoh Akhenaton.[226][227] The Egyptians portrayed the god Ra as being carried across the sky in a solar barque, accompanied by lesser gods, and to the Greeks, he was Helios, carried by a chariot drawn by fiery horses. From the reign of Elagabalus in the late Roman Empire the Sun's birthday was a holiday celebrated as Sol Invictus (literally \"Unconquered Sun\") soon after the winter solstice, which may have been an antecedent to Christmas. Regarding the fixed stars, the Sun appears from Earth to revolve once a year along the ecliptic through the zodiac, and so Greek astronomers categorized it as one of the seven planets (Greek planetes, \"wanderer\"); the naming of the days of the weeks after the seven planets dates to the Roman era.[228][229][230] In Proto-Indo-European religion, the Sun was personified as the goddess *Seh2ul.[231][232] Derivatives of this goddess in Indo-European languages include the Old Norse S√≥l, Sanskrit Surya, Gaulish Sulis, Lithuanian Saulƒó, and Slavic Solntse.[232] In ancient Greek religion, the sun deity was the male god Helios,[233] who in later times was syncretized with Apollo.[234] In the Bible, Malachi 4:2 mentions the \"Sun of Righteousness\" (sometimes translated as the \"Sun of Justice\"),[235][236] which some Christians have interpreted as a reference to the Messiah (Christ).[237] In ancient Roman culture, Sunday was the day of the sun god. In paganism, the Sun was a source of life, giving warmth and illumination. It was the center of a popular cult among Romans, who would stand at dawn to catch the first rays of sunshine as they prayed. The celebration of the winter solstice (which influenced Christmas) was part of the Roman cult of the unconquered Sun (Sol Invictus). It was adopted as the Sabbath day by Christians. The symbol of light was a pagan device adopted by Christians, and perhaps the most important one that did not come from Jewish traditions. Christian churches were built so that the congregation faced toward the sunrise.[238] Tonatiuh, the Aztec god of the sun,[239] was closely associated with the practice of human sacrifice.[239] The sun goddess Amaterasu is the most important deity in the Shinto religion,[240][241] and she is believed to be the direct ancestor of all Japanese emperors.[240] Solar System ‚Üí Local Interstellar Cloud ‚Üí Local Bubble ‚Üí Gould Belt ‚Üí Orion Arm ‚Üí Milky Way ‚Üí Milky Way subgroup ‚Üí Local Group ‚Üí Local Sheet ‚Üí Virgo Supercluster ‚Üí Laniakea Supercluster ‚Üí Local Hole ‚Üí Observable universe ‚Üí UniverseEach arrow (‚Üí) may be read as \"within\" or \"part of\".",

                "content": "When Mitch Jeter went out with injury earlier this season, Notre Dame was statistically the worst field goal kicking team in the nation. Let's just say the Irish will be kissing their clovers they have their kicker back. He drilled the 41 yarder to call game and send Notre Dame back to the National Championship. They will be looking to return the title back to South Bend for the first time since 1988, but before they set their sights either Texas or Ohio State, they will celebrate this Orange Bowl win. Penn States defense made a stop and gave Drew Allar and the offense a chance to win it late in the fourth quarter, but the Jr. QB who has thrown 53 touchdown and just 9 INTs in his career made the worst mistake you could possibly make in this situation and the rest is history. Allar went 12/23 for 135 yards, but his last throw was the biggest one of the game as Christian Gray set up ND in perfect position to win it. As always their fearless leader, Riley Leonard, rallied his guys and tied the game up with this 54 yard pass to Jaden Greathouse to took it all the way into the end zone and tied the game with under five minutes to go. Leonard ended the game with 223 yards 1 TD and 2 INTs on 15/23 passing, but he made the big plays when he needed to, and they needed this bomb to Greathouse to level things up late in the game. Allar was picked off in the end zone just a few played after the Leonard interception, but a pass interference penalty against the Irish gave Penn State a first down inside the 10 yard line and Singleton completed his hat trick of touchdowns as the Nittany Lions retook the lead. On the next play from scrimmage following Singleton's second TD run, Riley Leonard was picked off by Dani Dennis-Sutton and momentum completely shifted for Penn State who had a short field to work with after forcing the turnover. Losing the lead seemed to ignite the Nittany Lions as Drew Allar had a couple of long pass plays to set up this Singleton touchdown to set up a do or die last 10 minutes from Miami. ND seemingly had all the momentum ending the first half and starting the second. They scored 17 unanswered points to take the lead with this tough Jeremiyah Love TD run early in the fourth quarter. The Irish would finish the game with 115 yards rushing, and Love led the way with 45 yards on 11 carries. Notre Dame saw their starting QB and leader Riley Leonard take a big hit and get knocked out of the game for a drive and Steve Angeli came in and lead the team down the field and set up a field goal to get ND on the board. Coming out of the break, the Irish started to use the ground game, after having just 15 yards rushing in the first half. They ran it for 44 yards on this drive alone and that seemed to open up the passing game for the rest of the way. Leonard came back in the game after half and he tied the game up with a TD run to start the third quarter. The Nittany Lions offense went to the hurry up after taking the field goal lead and marched down the field on the shoulders of Nick Singleton who punched in his first of three TDs. The Notre Dame Fighting Irish are heading to the College Football Playoff National Championship after a dramatic ending from Miami as they took down the Penn State Nittany Lions in the Orange Bowl. Mitch Jeter kicked the winning field goal in a 27-24 game that went down to the wire. We didn't expect many fireworks between these two teams but that's exactly what we got. It took a little while for the offense to kick in, and what ignited it was a defensive play made by Penn State. That led to a Nittany Lion field goal after getting down to the one yard line but getting stopped on a goal to go situation. We'll get to the rest of the highlights in a second. But first, Mitch Jeter with the biggest kick of his life, and he drills it. Penn State made a big stop and had a chance to take the lead, but Allar's pass was picked by Christian Gray and that set up the Fighting Irish with a chance to win it in the last minute.

As always the pre kickoff festivities are taking a little longer than usual, but it's coin flip time and the Fighting Irish win the toss and they differ to the second half. Penn State will start the CFP Semifinal with the ball. It all comes down to next Monday. The winner of tonight‚Äôs game and the winner of tomorrow‚Äôs Cotton Bowl will meet at Mercedes Benz Stadium for a chance at the CFP Nation Championship. The last time this game was played here in Atlanta was back in 2018 when the Alabama Crimson Tide beat the Georgia Bulldogs. Notre Dame has 11 titles, Penn State has two, Texas has four and Ohio State has eight. These are teams with massive championship pedigrees. Remember, this is just one of two CFP semifinals this week. After Notre Dame and Penn State duke it out tonight in Miami, the Texas Longhorns and the Ohio State Buckeyes will play tomorrow in the Cotton Bowl from Dallas. That will lead us into a two game NFL playoff slate on Saturday featuring the Chargers vs. Texans and Steeles vs. Ravens. Sunday we have the Broncos vs. Bills, Packers vs. Eagles and Commanders vs. Buccaneers. We will finish the football frenzy with a Monday Night match up between the Vikings and the Rams and remember you can follow all the action right here on AS English. This is the first time we have seen the 12 team playoff, and there is a lot to digest after the first few weeks. It‚Äôs tough for the NCAA to get everything right on the first attempt, and heading into the semifinals we see no teams that had a first round bye still alive in the CFP. The teams that were supposed to be favorites and have the advantage of getting the BYE week, looked rusty and were eventually knocked out. This will be Notre Dame and Penn State‚Äôs third game since the end of their ‚Äúseason‚Äù and it seems like these teams are back in midseason form after basically starting a new season three weeks ago. These playoffs have shown us rust is winning in the rust vs. rest debate. Penn State have one of the best one-two punches in the league with Kaytron Allen and Nicholas Singleton in their backfield. Both RBs have run for 1,000+ yards, with Allen rising for 10 yards more (1,026) but he has almost 50 carries more than Allen. Singleton is more of a dual threat back, having caught 39 passes fo 342 yards and five TDs through the air. Together they have 17 TDs on the ground and another 7 TDs receiving. This is a team that‚Äô has a nice balance of their run and pass game, but over the last two games their defense has stepped up and allowed just 24 points in two games. There has been a lot of talk about Riley Leonard and his ability to lead his team and his will to win. The senior QB wasn‚Äôt up for any end of season awards for his quarterbacking play, but he is a winner. He threw for just 2,383 yards, 18 TDs and 6 INTs this season, but he is equally or even more dangerous with his feet. He‚Äôs got 831 yards rushing on the season and scored another 15 TDs with his feet, but the question is can he lead this offense tonight if Penn State stops the run and he has to pass the ball? He had just 90 yards passing against Georgia last week, but did throw a TD pass right before the half to swing the momentum in favor of ND, and ran for 80 yards. If the Irish are going to win, it‚Äôs going to come down to how their QB plays. The question coming into this game, and really all of head coach James Franklin‚Äôs time in South Bend is can he win the big one? After coming into the season ranked in the Top 10 in the nation, they won their first seven games but only one of them was against a ranked team, and that was No. 19 Illinois. They lost their first game to 4th ranked Ohio State 20-13 at the beginning of November, but then they won four straight to set up a meeting with the Oregon Ducks in the Big 10 Championship. They lost that game by a TD, and again the questions around Franklin started to surface. Wins over SMU and Boise State have given their coach a little leeway but now come the big big games. Notre Dame came into the season ranked in the top 10 in the preseason polls, but suffered a heartbreaking defeat to the Norther Illinois Huskies in their second game of the season after Mitch Jeter had his 62 yard game-winning field goal blocked as time ran out. Since then the Fighting Irish have been perfect. They have won 12 straight including but the question remains? Who have the Fighting Irish beat this year? They beat three ranked teams in the regular season none higher than 15th and beat an over achieving Indiana team in the first round of the playoffs before beating a Georgia team with a back up who had only thrown a handful of passes in his college career before last week‚Äôs game. After taking down SMU in the opening game of their playoff schedule, the Penn State Nittany Lions met Ashton Jenty and the Boise State Broncos. They contained the leading rusher in the country to just 104 yards on 30 carries, meanwhile Drew Allar threw two of his three TDs in the first quarter to take a 14-0 lead. Kaytron Allen and 134 yards on a day that Penn State ran for over 200 total yards and Nicholas Singleton capped the game with a 58 yard TD run to take a 31-14 lead with under 5:00 to go in the fourth quarter to set State up with a massive match up against Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl from Miami. After winning the battle for Indiana in a frigid South Bend to open their College Football Playoff slate, the fighting Irish met the Georgia Bulldogs who had won two of the last three CFP National Championships. With the Bulldogs‚Äô starting QB Carson Beck out with injury they went to their back up Gunner Stockton and the Fighting Irish defense shut him down for most of the game. It was a low scoring first half until the final minute of the second quarter. Mitch Jeter kicked a field goal to put ND up 6-3, on the next play from scrimmage, Stockton was strip sacked by RJ Oben which led to a 13 yard TD pass from Riley Leonard to Beaux Collins to end the first half. The Fighting Irish got the ball to start the second half and Jayden Harrison took the kick off 98 yards for a TD and the Irish went from a 3-3 game with 43 seconds left in the first half to leading 20-3 fifteen seconds into the third quarter. They would hold off the Bulldogs and win 23-10 to reach the CFP semifinal tonight against Penn State. Hello everyone and welcome to Miami where two legendary teams are back fighting for the top prize in college football after years trying to keep up with the top dogs in the game. They have advanced through the first two games of the expanded college football playoff and now they are just a game away from the National Championship. Notre Dame has only lost one game all season and that was back in early September. If they want to get to the big game, they will have to extend either win streak tonight against a Penn State team that has dominated both of their playoff games after losing their Big Ten Championship to Oregon to end the regular season. The stage it set. Two of the best teams in the history of the college football, with a chance to get to the title game here from Miami. Sit back, relax and enjoy. We‚Äôve got a throwback battle of two of the most historic, prolific schools in college football history tonight in the Capital One Orange Bowl. It‚Äôs been a long time since either of these two schools have been in the running for a National Championship but they have turned back the clock tonight one of them will punch their ticket to the College Football Playoff National Championship. It‚Äôs the Notre Dame Fighting Irish taking on the Penn State Nittany Lions in the CFP semifinal, and AS English will be with you all night providing live coverage, stats, highlights and analysis of tonight‚Äôs game form Hard Rock Stadium.",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. For the first time since 2012, Notre Dame will play for a national title. The (7) Fighting Irish advanced to the College Football Playoff National Championship with a 27-24 win against (6) Penn State in Thursday evening's Orange Bowl. Fittingly, in a game that saw four lead changes, it came down to some last-second heroics. Penn State had a chance to win the game. The Nittany Lions took possession on their own 15-yard line with 52 seconds to play and two timeouts. Needing yardage to get into field goal range, they decided to lean on the arm of quarterback Drew Allar, who hopped around in the pocket and tried the middle of the field, where Notre Dame defensive back Christian Gray made a diving interception to give his team possession in Penn State territory. After a couple of runs and a 10-yard connection between quarterback Riley Leonard and wide receiver Jaden Greathouse, Notre Dame worked the ball into field goal range. Kicker Mitch Jeter -- who is now 7 of 8 during Notre Dame's College Football Playoff run -- nailed a 41-yard field goal to send his team to Atlanta. Penn State tried to lateral its way to a miraculous win on one final possession, but Notre Dame's defense was up to the task. This loss especially stings for Penn State, given that it led 10-0 late into the first half. The Nittany Lions also scored 14 unanswered points early in the fourth quarter to take a 24-17 lead -- stoning a 17-0 run from Notre Dame in the process -- and, of course, possessed the ball with less than a minute to play. CBS Sports was here throughout with updates, highlights and analysis. Read on below for takeaways from Notre Dame's win over Penn State. Penn State edge rusher Abdul Carter's status was up in the air ahead of the Orange Bowl. He suffered a left shoulder injury in the quarterfinal round against Boise State that caused him to miss a majority of the game, and most of his left arm was wrapped tonight. Still, he suited up and made his presence felt. Carter finished the game with five total tackles, two for a loss, and one sack. He also collected several quarterback pressures while moving all over the field in Penn State's pass-rush packages. One of those pressured forced Notre Dame quarterback Riley Leonard into throwing an interception. Carter did all that in spite of the fact his left shoulder was still bothering him. Now he's likely off to the NFL Draft, where most projections have him going off the board early in the first round. Penn State running back Nick Singleton deserves special mention for his Herculean efforts. The Nittany Lions star carried the ball 15 times for 84 yards and scored all three of his team's offensive touchdowns. Penn State tight end Tyler Warren also did a lot for the Nittany Lions and finished the game with 96 total yards. But those efforts underscored a serious problem for Penn State, one that tanked its hopes as the game wore on: the Nittany Lions seriously lack in playmakers on the outside. Penn State's wide receivers did not record a single catch on just five targets. Though Warren and Singleton are excellent options, the lack of a threat elsewhere allowed Notre Dame's defense to focus on stopping that dynamic duo. Penn State's final drive was an example: no one was able to get open deep or break a big play. Compare that to Notre Dame, which had a star emerge in sophomore wide receiver Jaden Greathouse. He was a safety valve with the biggest play of the night -- a 54-yard score with a pair of ankle breakers that tied the game at 24 with just under five minutes left to play in the fourth quarter. Third down is the money down for a reason. In a game where Penn State and Notre Dame traded blows and finished with relatively comparable stats (though the Nittany Lions did have a significant rushing advantage) third downs made all the difference. Penn State did almost everything wrong in third-down situations. The Nittany Lions were 3 of 11 and coverted just one in the second half. Notre Dame went 11 of 17 despite some long-to-go situations, gaining an average of seven yards and converting all eight attempts on third-and-short (4 yards or fewer). This is the same Notre Dame team that lost to Northern Illinois early in the year. This is the same Notre Dame team that has lost several of its top players, including a potential first-round cornerback in Benjamin Morrison and its leading sack artist in defensive lineman Rylie Mills, to injury. Through it all, the Fighting Irish have displayed a tremendous amount of grit and determination. That grit was on full display in the Orange Bowl. Quarterback Riley Leonard left the game late in the first half with an apparent head injury. He returned for the first drive in the third quarter, completed a 36 yard pass to Aneyas Williams and then rushed for a 3-yard touchdown to tie the game at 10. One of the key blockers on that play? Offensive lineman Charles Jagusah, who tore his pectoral muscle less than a month before the 2024 season began and only recently started playing again. Early in the fourth quarter, Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love -- who has been limited with a knee injury throughout the College Football Playoff -- plowed through three Penn State defenders and bullied his way into the end zone to give Notre Dame its first lead of the game. Then, with less than a minute to play, Notre Dame cornerback Christian Gray -- who has stepped into an increased role this year due to Morrison's injury -- was the one that intercepted Penn State quarterback Drew Allar. Notre Dame keeps finding a way, and now it's one win from a national title. Notre Dame kicker Mitch Jeter just nailed a 41-yard field goal to give Notre Dame a late lead with less than 10 seconds to play. Penn State will get chance to either tie the game or win, but it's going to take some real heroics since the Nittany Lions are out of timeouts. That was an inexcusable mistake from Penn State quarterback Drew Allar. Trying to lead the Nittany Lions on a potential game-winning drive, he instead threw an ill-advised interception to Notre Dame defensive back Christian Gray. Now Fighting Irish take over in Penn State territory with three timeouts. This after Notre Dame fumbled its own opportunity to potentially walk the game off. On third-and-5 from Penn State's 44-yard line -- not far from field goal range -- quarterback Riley Leonard dropped back to pass. He came under immediate pressure and sacked by Coziah Izzard, forcing the Fighting Irish to punt instead. Penn State will take over at its own 15-yard line with 47 seconds and two timeouts left. As they always say, football is a game of runs. Penn State appeared to be in firm control after ripping off a 14-0 scoring streak, but Notre Dame just swung momentum right back in its favor with a huge touchdown play. Wide receiver Jaden Greathouse got open in Penn State's secondary after a defensive back slipped and fell. Fighting Irish quarterback Riley Leonard hit Greathouse in stride, which allowed him to dance around another Penn State defender in the open field and finish the play by sprinting into the end zone. It's the first passing touchdown for either team and, at 54 yards, is also the longest play all evening. Might want to change Penn State's mascot to the Nick Singletons, because he is literally carrying the offense in the Orange Bowl. The Nittany Lions got the ball inside Notre Dame's 10-yard line thanks to a pass interference penalty on Notre Dame's Adon Shuler. There, Singleton took another handoff and dragged a Notre Dame defender into the end zone for his third touchdown of the night. Penn State was granted that scoring opportunity after Notre Dame quarterback Riley Leonard threw his second interception of the game. This is just Leonard's second multi-interception game of his career; the other was the NIU loss. That was a back-breaking mistake from Notre Dame quarterback Riley Leonard. One play after Notre Dame tied the game with a big touchdown, Leonard stared tight end Mitchell Evans down and thew an interception to Penn State's Dani Dennis-Sutton, who did a good job of undercutting Evans' route and reading Leonard's eyes. It's Penn State's second interception of the night, and it gives the Nittany Lions possession just outside field goal range. Not to be outdone, Penn State running back Nick Singleton just had an incredibly tough run of his own. On second-and-goal from Notre Dame's 7-yard line, Singleton took a handoff, changed direction, made one Notre Dame defender missed and then plowed through another would-be tackler near the goal line to score his second touchdown of the evening. That capped a huge drive for Penn State, which moved the ball down the field -- largely without star tight end Tyler Warren, who missed a chunk in the injury tent after a hard landing -- thanks to some solid play from quarterback Drew Allar. The Nittany Lions needed that answer after allowing 17 straight points to Notre Dame. Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love's knee looks alright. It certainly didn't keep him plowing through Penn State's defense for a crucial touchdown to open the fourth quarter. Love took an inside handoff and bounced off one Penn State defender. As he got near the line of scrimmage, he met a crowd of would-be tacklers, bowled through them and stretched the ball to break into the end zone. It's Notre Dame's second rushing touchdown of the night, and it gives the Irish their first lead. Penn State's offense, which managed just 25 yards in the third quarter, has to find its footing. Entering halftime, it appeared as if Notre Dame was taking on water. But a last-second field goal, and then a hot start to the third quarter, have momentum on the Fighting Irish's side as they enter the fourth quarter of their Orange Bowl showdown against Penn State. Key to Notre Dame's turnaround has been its play in the trenches on both sides of the ball. Though the offensive line has still allowed some leaks, it has done a much better job of opening lanes in the running game and keeping a clean pocket for quarterback Riley Leonard, who scored on a rushing touchdown early in the third quarter to tie the game at 10-all. He also had a big 36-yard completion to Aneyas Williams to put the Irish in scoring range. Defensively, Notre Dame allowed just 25 yards -- including -3 yards rushing -- in the third quarter. The Fighting Irish also got their first sack of the game, courtesy of Rod Heard II, to force a punt near the end of the third frame. Notre Dame will open the fourth quarter with the ball and a chance to take its first lead of the evening. Penn State has had some problems fielding punts in the Orange Bowl. Thus far, none of the decisions have ended in disaster, but it has made things more difficult for the Nittany Lions. After allowing a touchdown on the opening drive in the third quarter, Penn State's defense buckled down and just forced a punt. Return man Zion Tracy, instead of calling for a fair catch in the face of Notre Dame's punt coverage unit, decided to field the kick at the 15-yard line. He was blasted by a Notre Dame gunner and just held on to the ball. Earlier in the first quarter, Tracy called for a fair catch at Penn State's 2-yard line, so he's having some trouble making decisions on the fly. Game on. At one point near the end of the first half, this one seemed to be slipping away from Notre Dame. But a last-second field goal in the second quarter apparently gave the Fighting Irish the momentum they needed to swing the Orange Bowl right back. Riley Leonard looks fine. After exiting the game late in the first half, he led Notre Dame's offense onto the field in the third quarter and looked dialed in. He delivered a perfect 36-yard pass to Aneyas Williams to put Notre Dame in striking distance, and then finished the scoring drive a couple of plays later by rushing into the end zone from three yards out. Notre Dame's offensive line needed that drive. The Irish did a good job creating space in the run game and keeping the pocket clean after a rough first half. The pressure is back on Penn State now. Notre Dame will receive the second half's opening kickoff. There's plenty to keep an eye on as the Fighting Irish take the field. Top of the list is the status of quarterback Riley Leonard, who exited late in the first half with an apparent head injury. Backup Steve Angeli did well to get Notre Dame in field goal range as time expired, but Notre Dame has crafted its offense around Leonard this year. Notre Dame also has a couple of offensive linemen, including starting left tackle Anthonie Knapp, that have been dealing with injuries. Penn State leads Notre Dame 10-3 after the first half of play in the Orange Bowl. The Nittany Lions scored all 10 of their points in the second quarter thanks to a renewed focus on the run game and a pair of lengthy drives that took plenty of time off of the clock. Penn State took 14 plays to kick a 20-yard field goal near the start of the second quarter, and then embarked on a 17-play, 90-yard drive that ended in a 5-yard touchdown with just over two minutes left in the half. The Nittany Lions got 81 of those 90 yards running the ball thanks to an offensive linethat imposed its will. Penn State averaged a brisk 5.4 yards per carry in the first half. Tight end Tyler Warren, who also had 17 yards receiving, contributed 21 yards to Penn State's rushing attack. Penn State's defense also deserves plenty of credit. Notre Dame averaged 22.3 points per game in the first half over its 12-game winning streak entering the Orange Bowl but scored just three points on a last-second field goal in the second quarter. This is also just the second time this season that Notre Dame has trailed at the half. Like the offense, Penn State's defense did a lot of its work in the trenches. Despite having his left arm heavily wrapped, Penn State edge rusher Abdul Carter was a consistent presence in Notre Dame's backfield. He was one of five Penn State players with at least a half tackle for loss and also contributed one of Penn State's three sacks in the first half. To make matters worse for Notre Dame, more key injuries starting to mount. Quarterback Riley Leonard left the game late in the second quarter with an apparent head injury and his status for the second half is up in the air. Notre Dame also lost left tackle Anthonie Knapp and starting guard Rocco Spindler, which undoubtedly contributed to Penn State's dominance at the line of scrimmage. The blows keep mounting for Notre Dame, which is in a 10-0 hole near the end of the first half. Starting quarterback Riley Leonard just took another hit and went to Notre Dame's medical tent at the behest of the game officials. Backup quarterback Steve Angeli entered the game for Leonard, who was able to walk off the field under his own power. What a drive for Penn State. The Nittany Lions moved Notre Dame off of the ball to embark on a 15-play, 90-yard drive that took 7:17 off of the clock and ended with a 5-yard rushing touchdown from running back Nick Singleton. Penn State gathered 81 of those 90 yards on the ground, as Singleton and Kaytron Allen consistently carried the ball for gains of at least five yards. Tight end Tyler Warren also rushed for 21 yards and caught a screen pass for a first down on fourth-and-2 in the red zone. Penn State is in the midst of a dominant drive. The Nittany Lions have worked the ball all the way to the red zone behind a strong rushing effort. They are winning at the point of attack thus far, as running backs Kaytron Allen and Nick Singleton are consistently getting chunk gains to keep the chains moving. Tight end Tyler Warren has also factored heavily into the game plan. He converted a fourth-and-2 with a quick screen catch and also had an athletic run earlier in the drive that turned what looked like a big loss into a gain of nine. Notre Dame starting left tackle Anthonie Knapp was injured following a first-down run from quarterback Riley Leonard. It appeared as if Leonard fell on Knapp's legs as he was getting tackled. Knapp was slow to get up after the play and eventually fell to the turf before making it back to the huddle. He was taken to the locker room with the help of trainers. The Fighting Irish can hardly afford anymore injuries -- especially along the offensive line, where they entered the 2024 season shorthanded. Penn State just took an early lead off of a 20-yard field goal from kicker Ryan Barker, but the Nittany Lions definitely left points on the board. On third-and-goal from Notre Dame's 1-yard line, quarterback Drew Allar short-armed an easy throw in the flats to running back Nick Singleton, who was unable to make the catch. A better throw from Allar and Singleton would have walked into the end zone. Settling for the points was a smart move, though there may have been temptation to go for it. Penn State and Notre Dame are locked in a defensive battle after one quarter of play in the Orange Bowl. Moving the ball hasn't necessarily been an issue -- both teams have at least made it around midfield, and each has had decent chunk gains on offense -- but finishing drives has been an issue. It is a testament to the defensive strength in this matchup. Penn State has been especially impressive. The Nittany Lions forced a crucial turnover, courtesy of a Zakee Wheatley interception, near the end of the first quarter to set up a prime scoring opportunity. Though he has a heavy wrap on his left arm, Penn State edge rusher Abdul Carter is dominating the game early on. He already has one tackle and a couple of quick quarterback pressures -- one of which led to Penn State's interception -- as Notre Dame does not have an answer for him. In spite of the slug fest thus far, Penn State will have a prime scoring opportunity when the second quarter starts. The Nittany Lions face third-and-goal from Notre Dame's 1-yard line. Penn State is going to have favorable field position after the defense forced yet another turnover. On third-and-12 from Notre Dame's 33-yard line, Irish quarterback Riley Leonard tried to hit a wide receiver on a deep crossing route. But the ball sailed well over the intended receiver's head and Penn State defensive back Zakee Wheatley jumped into the air to snag the overthrow. The Nittany Lions will take over on their own 42-yard line with a premium chance to break the scoring seal. Penn State edge rusher Abdul Carter has been favoring his heavily wrapped left arm, but that hasn't stopped him from having a big impact on this game thus far. On Notre Dame's first offensive drive, he cut a quarterback run short with a quick tackle. Then, on the first play of the Irish's second drive, he ripped into the backfield and applied immediate pressure on Riley Leonard, who was forced to throw the ball away before Carter could meet him. He also got pressure on Leonard a couple plays later in the same drive, which resulted in Leonard throwing an interception. Carter still has explosiveness off the edge, even if one of his arms is clipped. Both Notre Dame and Penn State have had an opportunity to make an offensive impression, and each has achieved a nice chunk gain. For the Nittany Lions, quarterback Drew Allar completed a short pass to running back Nick Singleton for a gain of 23 yards. Notre Dame's explosive play came on a 32-yard connection between quarterback Riley Leonard and tight end Mitchell Evans, who made a nice catch with a defensive back draped all over him and picked up extra yardage while tip-toeing the sidelines. But in both instances, the drives stalled around midfield and ended with a punt. It could take a while for a breakthrough to happen. Penn State looked like it was building some early momentum, especially after a 23-yard completion to running back Nick Singleton out of the backfield, but Notre Dame's defense locked things down near midfield. A false start on Penn State gave the Nittany Lions third-and-14 and a short pass to Kaytron Allen came up well short of the sticks. It's worth watching how Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love looks when the Fighting Irish's offense takes the field. He's been dealing with a nagging knee injury, and he was sporting a brace as Notre Dame went through its pregame warm ups. Notre Dame won the toss and deferred its selection to the second half, which means that Penn State will start with the ball. In what's expected to be a low scoring, defensive battle, the Nittany Lions have an opportunity to set the tone with their scripted drive. Expect offensive coordinator Andy Kotelnicki to get creative with his play-calling to try and find weaknesses against an excellent Notre Dame defense. It seems like, at some point, all of the injuries will catch up to Notre Dame. The Irish are in an especially precarious position if Love can't play given what he means to the offense. Yet, Notre Dame has more than made do with its lot as the Irish have continued carving a path of dominance all the way through the postseason against teams deemed by the selection committee as worthy of playing for a national championship. Notre Dame's played dominant along the lines of scrimmage, and it has a proven winner at quarterback in Riley Leonard, who has literally put his body on the line to keep his team's hopes alive. I'm not going to pick against the Irish at this point; they've shown no signs of slowing down. Pick: Notre Dame -2.5 (-105) Notre Dame players and staff members are dealing with a \"flu or a virus\" ahead of Thursday night's College Football Playoff semifinal against Penn State, a school official confirmed in a statement to CBS Sports' Brandon Marcello. The statement downplayed the severity of the outbreak, which it says occurred over the past 10 days to two weeks, and maintains that it will not impact any availability for the Orange Bowl. \"It will have no impact on the game,\" Notre Dame's statement read. \"Beaux Collins was impacted in the Sugar Bowl, but still played and was on the mend during the game.\" ¬© 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

                "title": "US TikTok ban: When could the app be banned and will Trump save it?",
                "content": "Social media company TikTok faces a ban in the US unless it is sold by its Chinese parent company ByteDance by 19 January. However, the country's highest judicial authority, the Supreme Court, agreed to hear a case on 10 January brought by TikTok, ByteDance and content creators, arguing the action being taken is unconstitutional. President-elect Donald Trump - who takes office the day after the ban is to come into force - has asked the Supreme Court to delay it so he can seek a \"political\" solution. US officials and lawmakers have accused ByteDance of being linked to the Chinese government. Many have cited national security concerns over the app, claiming that it could be forced by Beijing to hand over data about its 170 million US users. The US Justice Department has said that because of its Chinese parent company, and access to data on American users, TikTok poses \"a national-security threat of immense depth and scale\". In April 2024, US Congress passed a bill, which President Joe Biden signed into law, giving ByteDance nine months to find a US-approved buyer or see TikTok shut down across the US. TikTok and ByteDance deny being linked to the Chinese government, or that any data would be handed over. They have also previously ruled out a sale. The firms have filed multiple legal challenges against the law, saying it is \"unconstitutional\" and would have a \"staggering\" impact on free speech by censoring its US users. They have said that even a temporary ban in early 2025 would have \"devastating effects\" on their operations and users. Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 election may offer TikTok a lifeline. He tried to ban the app while he was in the White House in 2020, but has now called on the US Supreme Court to delay the ban while he works on a \"political resolution\". Ahead of the hearing, his lawyer filed a legal brief saying that Trump \"opposes banning TikTok\" and intends to resolve the issues \"through political means once he takes office\". Trump's meeting with TikTok's boss Shou Zi Chew in December also increased hopes among the law's opponents that he would intervene. The Supreme Court will consider TikTok and Bytedance's arguments - and Trump's request for the matter to be delayed - and decide whether to overturn the lower court's ruling. It is not known how long that decision will take. However if the Supreme Court upholds the law banning the platform, it is unclear what Trump would do to prevent it going offline. Online marketplaces, such as app stores, and web hosting platforms will have to stop making TikTok available to Americans if its ban goes ahead. Politicians have told Apple and Google's bosses to be ready to pull TikTok from the App Store and Google Play store for iOS and Android devices. Most people download apps onto their smartphones and tablets through app stores, so the ban would stop new users from getting TikTok. It also would mean that people who already had the app would no longer be able to get future updates designed to improve security or fix bugs. The bill forbids applications controlled by US adversary countries from being updated and maintained in the US. It gives broad powers to the president to limit apps with ties not only to China but also Russia, Iran and North Korea. At the heart of TikTok is its algorithm - a set of instructions that determine the content displayed to users, based on data about how they engaged with other material. TikTok can use this data, as well as information about an individual user's device, location and keystroke rhythms, to recommend videos to users on its automatically generated For You feed. Some researchers have previously claimed the app collects more data from users than others in order to power its highly personalised system. However, rival social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram collect similar user data. TikTok is already banned in India, which was one of the app's largest markets before it was outlawed there in June 2020. It is also blocked in Iran, Nepal, Afghanistan and Somalia. The UK government and Parliament banned TikTok from staff work devices in 2023, as has the European Commission. The BBC also advised staff to delete TikTok from corporate phones because of security fears. Opposition parties had called for the chancellor to stay home as UK borrowing costs continue to rise. Ellen Roome has been seeking access to Jools' social media accounts since he took his own life. Trump had launched a last-minute appeal at the US Supreme Court ahead of Friday's sentencing hearing. The US companies join other major firms donating funds for the ceremony on 20 January. TikTok is challenging a law that would see it banned in the US in a matter of days. Copyright 2025 BBC.

                "content": "TikTok has sparked concerns over potential user data collection and influence operations by the Chinese government, leading to restrictions and bans in the United States. In January 2020, the United States Army and Navy banned TikTok on government devices after the Defense Department labeled it a security risk. Before the policy change, army recruiters had been using the platform to attract young people. Unofficial promotional videos continue to be posted on TikTok under personal accounts, drawing the ire of government officials, but they have also helped boost the number of enlistees; several accounts have millions of views and followers.[1][2][3] In 2020, the United States government announced that it was considering banning the Chinese social media platform TikTok upon a request from then-president Donald Trump, who viewed the app as a national security threat. The result was that TikTok owner ByteDance‚Äîwhich initially planned on selling a small portion of TikTok to an American company‚Äîagreed to divest TikTok to prevent a ban in the United States and in other countries where restrictions are also being considered due to privacy concerns, which themselves are mostly related to its ownership by a firm based in China. TikTok later announced plans to file legal action challenging the order's transactional prohibitions with U.S. companies. The lawsuit against the Trump Administration's order was filed on August 24, 2020, with TikTok arguing that the order was motivated by Trump's efforts to boost re-election support through protectionist trade policies aimed at China. A separate suit filed the same day by TikTok's U.S. technical program manager Patrick Ryan against Trump and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross sought a temporary restraining order, arguing that his due process rights were violated and the ban was an \"unconstitutional taking\" of Ryan's property under the Fifth Amendment; the suit also claimed Trump's action was likely a retaliation because of TikTok videos organizing pranks against a recent Trump campaign rally. On June 9, 2021, the Biden Administration issued Executive Order 14034, \"Protecting Americans' Sensitive Data from Foreign Adversaries\" (\"EO 14034\"). EO 14034, overturning three Executive Orders signed by Donald Trump: Executive Order 13942, Executive Order 13943, and Executive Order 13971. Despite revoking these Executive Orders, the Biden Administration's EO 14304 has called upon other federal agencies to continue a broad review of foreign-owned applications set to continuously inform the President of the risk that the applications pose to personal data and national security.[4] The White House said that, \"The Biden Administration is committed to promoting an open, interoperable, reliable, and secure Internet; protecting human rights online and offline; and supporting a vibrant, global digital economy.\"[5] In December 2022, Senator Marco Rubio and representatives Mike Gallagher and Raja Krishnamoorthi introduced the Averting the National Threat of Internet Surveillance, Oppressive Censorship and Influence, and Algorithmic Learning by the Chinese Communist Party Act (ANTI-SOCIAL CCP Act), which would prohibit Chinese- and Russian-owned social networks from doing business in the United States.[6][7] On December 30, 2022, President Joe Biden signed the No TikTok on Government Devices Act, prohibiting the use of the app on devices owned by the federal government, with some exceptions.[8] Days after the Biden administration called on ByteDance, which owns TikTok, to sell the platform or face a ban, law enforcement officials disclosed that an investigation into TikTok was taking place. On March 17, 2023, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) officially launched an investigation of TikTok, including allegations that the company spied on American journalists.[9] On January 25, 2023, Missouri Senator Josh Hawley introduced a bill to ban the platform nationwide. That bill was blocked by a forced vote in the Senate on 29 March 2023.[10] In February and March 2023, the DATA Act and the RESTRICT Act were both introduced in the House of Representatives and Senate, respectively. The DATA Act, introduced on February 24 by Michael McCaul, aimed to ban selling non-public personal data to third-party buyers.[11] On March 7, Senator Mark Warner introduced the RESTRICT Act: if passed, it would give the Secretary of Commerce authority to review business transactions made by IT service and product vendors tied to designated \"foreign adversaries\" if they present an undue threat to national security, and have more than one million active users in the United States. The legislation would allow for the enforcement of orders and other mitigation measures, which could include mandatory divestment, or being prohibited from doing business in the United States.[12] On March 13, 2024, the United States House of Representatives passed the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (H.R. 7521) with largely bipartisan support from Democrat and Republican-party representatives.[13][14] It would ban operations related to the app completely within the country unless ByteDance makes a qualified divestiture as determined by the US president.[15] After modifications, the act passed the House again[16][17] and the United States Senate[18] before it was signed into law by Joe Biden on April 24, 2024. The earliest the ban could go into effect if not sold would be January 19, 2025. An additional 90 days could be issued on the deadline.[19] TikTok, Inc. v. Garland is a lawsuit brought by social media company TikTok against the United States government. Chinese internet technology company ByteDance Ltd. and its subsidiary TikTok, Inc. claim that the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA) violates the Freedom of Speech Clause of the First Amendment, the Bill of Attainder Clause of Article One, Section Nine, and the Due Process Clause and Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment.[20][21][22] The law bans or requires divestment of social media apps meeting specified criteria that are owned by foreign corporations from, or by corporations owned by foreign nationals from, countries designated as U.S. foreign adversaries and that have been determined by the President to present a significant national security threat, and explicitly defines TikTok and any application operated by a ByteDance subsidiary as a \"foreign adversary controlled application\" under the law.[23] Trump campaigned on promises of not banning TikTok, despite his original opposition.[34][35] Trump's cabinet picks for the FCC, as well as most Republicans, remain in favor of banning the app.[34] As of April 2023,[36][37] at least 34 out of 50 states have announced or enacted bans on state government agencies, employees, and contractors using TikTok on government-issued devices. State bans only affect government employees and do not prohibit civilians from having or using the app on their personal devices. Some public universities have also banned TikTok on campus Wi-Fi and university-owned computers. These include, but are not limited to: On April 14, 2023, Montana became the first state to pass legislation banning TikTok on all personal devices operating within state lines, and barring app stores from offering TikTok for download.[86][87][88] Governor Greg Gianforte signed the bill, Senate Bill (SB) 419, into law on May 17,[89][90] claiming he had banned TikTok \"to protect Montanans‚Äô personal and private data from the Chinese Communist Party.\"[91] The law was scheduled to take effect in January 2024.[89] However, Montana content creators filed suit against the state once the bill was signed.[92][93] The creators' lawsuit is financed and directed by TikTok, with law firm Davis Wright Tremaine representing them.[94] The ban was blocked by US District Judge Donald W. Molloy on December 1, 2023, as he stated the ban \"infringes on the Constitutional right of users and businesses\". Due to the block, the ban did not come into effect as planned.[95] On January 2, 2024, Montana filed a notice to appeal the ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.[96] Groups such as the ACLU and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) opposed the ban, stating it constituted \"censorship\" and \"would set an alarming precedent for excessive government control over how Montanans use the internet.\"[97] Lobbying group NetChoice argued that the ban is an unconstitutional bill of attainder and also violates the freedom of speech clause of the First Amendment.[98] Hours after the bill was signed into law, five TikTok creators filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Montana against the state. A spokeswoman for Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen said that the state is \"fully prepared to defend the law\".[99] In a preliminary ruling November 30, 2023, federal judge Donald Molloy blocked the law citing constitutional concerns.[100] Specifically, Judge Molloy wrote that \"the State fails to show how SB 419 is constitutionally permissible.\"[101][102] The law faces technical restrictions. The App Store and Google Play Store track users by country, not by state, and would need to define the behavior when a user crosses state lines. While Apple and Google may be able to use IP addresses to track device locations, users may be able to use a virtual private network (VPN) to circumvent the restriction. If these app stores are found to be hosting TikTok for Montana users, violators could face fines of $10,000 per day.[103] TikTok has stated that it would need to collect data from users in order to comply with the bill.[104] In July 2020, Wells Fargo banned the app from company devices due to privacy and security concerns.[105] In August 2023, New York City banned TikTok on government-owned devices for security reasons.[106] A July 2020 poll from Morning Consult, with 2,200 surveyed, found that 29% of American adults supported a TikTok ban, 33% opposed one, and 38% had no opinion.[107] An August 2020 poll from Reuters/Ipsos, surveying 1,349, had 40% supporting Trump's move to ban the app, 30% opposed, and 30% uncertain.[108] A December 2022 poll from Rasmussen Reports, surveying 1,000 likely U.S. voters, found that 68% supported proposals to federally ban TikTok, with 43% strongly supporting a ban. Conversely, 24% surveyed were opposed, including 12% who strongly opposed.[109] A March 2023 poll from The Washington Post, surveying 1,027 American adults, found that 41% supported the federal government banning TikTok, while 25% remain opposed to a ban.[110] Another March poll, from Pew Research Center, found twice as many adult Americans support the U.S. government's ban on TikTok as oppose it (50% vs. 22%), though a significant portion (28%) remain unsure.[111] A December 2023 poll from Pew Research Center found 38% in favor of a ban, reflecting a decrease among Republicans even amid renewed efforts by their party leaders to ban the app.[112] A February 2024 poll by the Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found 31% of the respondents were in favor of a nationwide ban of TikTok, while 35% said they were opposed to it. Overall 56% said they supported a limited ban on government devices.[113] An April 2024 poll by Reuters/Ipsos found that a majority of Americans believe that TikTok is used by the Chinese government to influence public opinion.[114] TikTok began working on Project Texas after 2020 to address data concerns from the US government.[115] From 2019 to 2024, TikTok and ByteDance combined spent $27 million on lobbying in the United States, including their hire of SKDK, a public affairs firm, in 2023 according to Politico.[116][117] Reuters reported that according to its sources, if all legal methods to block the April 2024 ban are exhausted, ByteDance would prefer to shut down TikTok than sell it with its core algorithm, which is also subject to China's export control.[118] On May 7, 2024, ByteDance and TikTok filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to overturn the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act.[119][120] Some advertisers increased their spending on TikTok in 2023. Edward East, CEO of marketing agency Billion Dollar Boy, stated that instead of being intimidated by a potential ban, the industry is seeing an increase in brand investment through TikTok.[121] In May 2024, trade association NetChoice removed TikTok as a member after facing pressures and potential investigations by US lawmakers. NetChoice had previously defended TikTok.[122] Following the passing of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, eight TikTok content creators sued the United States government on May 14, 2024, in United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in an effort to overturn the act; the choice of venue was due to a provision in the act making it the \"exclusive jurisdiction\" for legal challenges of the act.[123] In March 2024, a spokesperson for Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China said the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act was putting the U.S. on \"the opposite side of the principle of fair competition and international economic and trade rules.\"[124] Representatives from the Embassy of China in Washington, D.C. met with U.S. congressional staffers to lobby against the bill.[125] The Central Propaganda Department of the Chinese Communist Party also instructed the country's state media outlets to increase positive coverage of ByteDance, although overall Beijing's response seems to be muted so far.[126] Bans and attempted bans in the United States have drawn objections citing hypocrisy, protectionism, and not addressing user data privacy in general. Lawmakers making allegations against TikTok fail to mention that the United States itself surveils non-US nationals under Section 702 of FISA.[127] The types of data collected by TikTok are also collected by other social media platforms and sold through brokers to private buyers and reportedly government agencies as well, without oversight.[127][128] A researcher at Georgia Tech's Internet Governance Project is concerned that Washington's attempt to protect the US market could backfire.[127] Some researchers from the Citizen Lab and the Center for Strategic and International Studies stated that user information in general should be protected, not just focusing on one platform.[128][129] There has been no public evidence of American TikTok user data being accessed by the Chinese government.[130][131][132] Critics have also labeled a potential ban on the app an assault on freedom of speech, including congressmen Rand Paul and Thomas Massie.[133][134]",

                "title": "How the US TikTok Ban Would Actually Work | WIRED",
                "content": "TikTok‚Äôs day of reckoning in the US has arrived. On Friday, the United States Supreme Court will hear the company‚Äôs appeal against its slated nationwide ban, which could come into force in a little more than a week if the company‚Äôs efforts fail. The social video app, which is owned by Chinese firm ByteDance and is used by around 170 million Americans, has been appealing the ban since US president Joe Biden signed the law underpinning it last year. The Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA) states that ByteDance must sell TikTok‚Äôs US business to a non-Chinese company by January 19‚Äîno buyer has yet been found‚Äîor see the app blocked in the US. Donald Trump, who retakes the White House on January 20, publicly originated the idea that ByteDance be forced to sell TikTok during his first presidential term but has since reversed course. The Supreme Court, which is hearing the case quickly due to the impending deadline and following a federal court upholding the ban in December, will determine whether the US Constitution‚Äôs First Amendment right to free speech is overruled by the government‚Äôs belief that TikTok is a threat to US national security. Proponents of PAFACA claim TikTok‚Äôs Chinese ownership could allow China to steal data on Americans and spread disinformation‚Äîalthough little evidence has been presented to support those claims, which the company denies. If the court allows the ban to go ahead‚Äîand Trump doesn‚Äôt find a way to stop it‚Äîthe move will be an unprecedented technological clampdown in the country. ‚ÄúThis is the first time we‚Äôve seen a national-level ban that appears imminent in the United States,‚Äù says Joseph Lorenzo Hall, a distinguished technologist at the Internet Society. TikTok has been banned or faces lawsuits in other countries, such as India, and the pressures come against the backdrop of total internet shutdowns and increased online censorship. ‚ÄúWhat we learned from all of those is that this ends up really hurting the people of the country, that the economic effects are immediate for people,‚Äù Hall says. So, how would TikTok actually be banned? Unpicking TikTok from the nation‚Äôs consciousness‚Äîthousands of influencers and businesses use the app to make money and promote themselves‚Äîis not exactly straightforward. Nor is it simple to untangle the company from US-based internet infrastructure. PAFACA doesn‚Äôt require anyone to uninstall TikTok from their phones. It also doesn‚Äôt say TikTok should directly stop its services from working in the US. Instead, it effectively tries to throttle TikTok by making it harder to use over time and by stopping companies from providing services that help it to keep working and quickly loading videos. TikTok, as with all companies mentioned in this story, did not respond to WIRED‚Äôs request for comment and hasn‚Äôt, at this stage, outlined what technical steps it will or will not take if the ban does eventually come into place. The law says it will be ‚Äúunlawful‚Äù for entities to ‚Äúdistribute, maintain or update‚Äù the app including its source code, or by ‚Äúproviding services‚Äù that allow it to keep running as it is now. This distribution, maintenance, or updates could be, the law says, by means of mobile app stores that can be accessed in the US or by ‚Äúproviding internet hosting services.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe law really deliberately avoided saying that it was illegal to have the app on your phone,‚Äù says Milton Mueller, a professor and cofounder of the Internet Governance Project at the Georgia Institute of Technology, who filed an amicus brief to the Supreme Court in opposition of the ban. ‚ÄúTheir attempt is to say nobody new can download it from the Apple or Google stores, and nobody who has it can update it through those stores,‚Äù Mueller says. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing in the law that says ‚ÄòTikTok you must block US users,‚Äô which is again interesting.‚Äù If TikTok is removed from Apple‚Äôs App Store and Google‚Äôs Play Store in the US, it will not be possible to directly install new updates that will add new features, fix bugs within the code, or quash security flaws. Over time, that means TikTok will stop functioning properly. Apple didn‚Äôt respond to WIRED‚Äôs request for comment, while Google declined to comment on what it will do if the law comes into effect. The law‚Äôs other focus is on stopping ‚Äúhosting‚Äù companies from providing services to TikTok‚Äîand the definition is pretty wide. Hosting companies ‚Äúmay include file hosting, domain name server hosting, cloud hosting, and virtual private server hosting,‚Äù the law says. Since the summer of 2022, as TikTok faced pressure about its Chinese ownership, the company has hosted US user data within Oracle‚Äôs cloud services. Oracle also did not respond to WIRED‚Äôs request for comment. Even so, other systems such as content delivery networks, advertising networks, payment providers, and more are used as part of TikTok‚Äôs infrastructure. The law does not specifically mention these services, but differing legal readings could make them question whether they help to ‚Äúmaintain‚Äù or ‚Äúdistribute‚Äù TikTok‚Äôs fully functioning service. Hall says a recent test of TikTok‚Äôs website showed 185 embedded domains on the page. ‚ÄúThey pull in code, content from that array of third-party providers and their own domains too,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe apps will start to decay and rot as either services stop working, things like content distribution networks or services who feel like they can't take the risks of the ambiguous nature of the language or the potential enforcement by the incoming administration.‚Äù There‚Äôs one internet infrastructure player that the ban does not specifically put pressure on: internet service providers. Countries such as Russia and China have developed censorship measures that allow them to block entire websites from being accessed through web bowsers. Mueller believes this omission by US lawmakers was likely deliberate, as it avoids setting up a Chinese-style internet firewall. ‚ÄúThey knew that a system of ISP-based blocking and filtering would obviously be a form of First Amendment restriction,‚Äù he says. While TikTok‚Äôs service in the US would likely degrade over time, there remain some potential ways around any ban‚Äîboth for individuals and potentially also the company itself. How effective these measures would be likely depends on how motivated people are to keep using TikTok and what the company decides to do. ‚ÄúTikTok has 170 million users,‚Äù says Alan Rozenshtein, an associate professor of law at the University of Minnesota, who is in favor of the law but says it is the ‚Äúbest of a bunch of bad options‚Äù relating to TikTok. ‚ÄúThis law will not prevent every one of them from accessing TikTok. I don‚Äôt think that was ever the goal of the law. The law is to make it meaningfully harder to access TikTok.‚Äù Theoretically, at least, TikTok could shift its services providers‚Äîsuch as hosting companies or content delivery networks‚Äîto be based outside of the United States. Using technical infrastructure based abroad, for instance in Europe, could allow TikTok to be served to people in the US while operating within the bounds of the law. While skirting the full-blown ban would allow people in the US to continue to use the app, that doesn‚Äôt mean the experience will be good. If videos are served from international locations, for example, load times may be slower for users, and it may be harder to upload videos. Using TikTok‚Äôs website isn‚Äôt the same experience as what the app provides, either. And that all depends on such a setup being possible at all. ‚ÄúI do think that the number of companies that can do that, that are not headquartered in the US, is going to be small, especially considering how hard it is to switch from one cloud provider to another,‚Äù Hall says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really difficult depending on a number of factors.‚Äù Aside from technical challenges, international companies may not be willing to risk flying in the face of US restrictions, particularly under an aggressive Trump administration that has already threatened Greenland and economic penalties on other countries. A TikTok ban would almost guarantee a spike in searches and downloads of virtual private networks (VPNs), which allow people to appear as if they are in a different geographic location to get around restrictions on content‚Äîfor instance, trying to watch Netflix while abroad. Using a VPN within the US may allow the TikTok app to keep working, although it is unclear whether the company will place any restrictions on users it can determine are in the US by other means. The company‚Äôs support pages say SIM card registration details and other information can be used to pinpoint someone‚Äôs location. Alternatively, it is likely Android users could download versions of TikTok outside of Google‚Äôs Play Store and install them on their devices. However, sideloading like this can come with security risks if the apps are not verified, and doing the same on an iPhone, via jailbreaking the device, is more technically complex. Equally, moves such as changing locations of app stores to be outside of the US may come with unforeseen consequences and prove harder to maintain for general users in the long term. For instance, if you are changing an iCloud account‚Äôs location, Apple advises that you may need to cancel subscriptions and have a valid payment method for the location you are changing it to. Prateek Waghre, a technology policy researcher based in India, where TikTok has been banned for four years and, despite an influx of some homegrown competitors, largely saw people move to Instagram Reels or YouTube‚Äôs Shorts, says overall restrictions on apps and websites weakens people‚Äôs experiences online and damages the internet as a whole. ‚ÄúFor many of us, [it is] the realization of one of our fears of a ‚Äòsplinternet,‚Äô‚Äù Waghre says. ‚ÄúYou will have different kinds of access based on different geography, which is not what the experience of the internet was.‚Äù In your inbox: Our biggest stories, handpicked for you each day License plate readers are leaking live video feeds and vehicle data CES 2025: All the products, trends, and quirky gadgets we‚Äôve seen The 17 best EVs coming in 2025 Visualization: We‚Äôre tracking every AI copyright lawsuit in the US More From WIRED Reviews and Guides ¬© 2025 Cond√© Nast.

                "content": "Advertisement Supported by The short-form video app lost a challenge to a law that will ban TikTok in the United States if its owner, ByteDance, does not sell to a non-Chinese company. It has pledged to appeal to the Supreme Court. By Sapna Maheshwari and Amanda Holpuch Concerns that the Chinese government could gain access to sensitive user data through the short-form video app TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, have prompted the U.S. government to pass legislation banning the social media platform unless it is sold to a government-approved buyer. President Biden signed into law legislation that gives ByteDance up to a year to divest from TikTok. The company lost its first legal effort to overturn the law on Dec. 6, when a panel of three federal judges unanimously rejected TikTok‚Äôs argument that the law violated the First Amendment. The company pledged to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. TikTok, which boasts 170 million users in the United States, could be banned as soon as mid-January, unless it receives a court-ordered injunction that would pause the law from taking effect as the appeal proceeds. There is also a chance that President-elect Donald J. Trump will try to rescue the app. Here‚Äôs why the pressure has been ratcheted up on TikTok. Lawmakers and regulators in the West have increasingly expressed concern that TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance, may put sensitive user data, like location information, into the hands of the Chinese government. They have pointed to laws that allow the Chinese government to secretly demand data from Chinese companies and citizens for intelligence-gathering operations. They are also worried that China could use TikTok‚Äôs content recommendations to fuel misinformation, a concern that has escalated in the United States during the Israeli-Hamas war and the presidential election. Critics say TikTok has fueled the spread of antisemitism. TikTok has long denied such allegations and has tried to distance itself from ByteDance, which is considered to be one of the world‚Äôs most highly valued start-ups.

Los Angeles wildfires: California National Guard to assist fire crews Since Tuesday, wildfires have ravaged different neighbourhoods in California, especially around the Los Angeles area. The California wildfires have killed at least 10 people and destroyed some 10,000 homes and structures, local officials have said. Los Angeles is home to Hollywood, America‚Äôs entertainment hub, and to many Hollywood celebrities. Many of these celebrities lost their houses in the fires. The Sunset Fire, which broke out on Wednesday about 6pm (02:00 GMT), particularly affected Hollywood Hills. Its cause is under investigation, but it ravaged 17 hectares (42 acres) of land. By midday on Thursday, Mayor Karen Bass reported that the Sunset Fire was contained. Billy Crystal: The 76-year-old American comedian and star of the 1980s iconic movie, When Harry Met Sally, lost the home that he has owned since 1979 in Pacific Palisades.

                "title": "Michelle Obama - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama[1] (n√©e Robinson; born January 17, 1964) is an American attorney and author who served as the first lady of the United States from 2009 to 2017, being married to Barack Obama, the 44th president of the United States. Raised on the South Side of Chicago, Obama is a graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Law School. In her early legal career, she worked at the law firm Sidley Austin where she met her future husband. She subsequently worked in nonprofits and as the associate dean of Student Services at the University of Chicago. Later, she served as vice president for community and external affairs of the University of Chicago Medical Center. Michelle married Barack in 1992, and they have two daughters. Obama campaigned for her husband's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. She was the first African-American woman to serve as first lady. As first lady, Obama worked as an advocate for poverty awareness, education, nutrition, physical activity, and healthy eating. She has written three books including her The New York Times best selling memoir Becoming (2018) and The Light We Carry (2022). Michelle LaVaughn Robinson was born on January 17, 1964, in Chicago, Illinois, to Fraser Robinson III (1935‚Äì1991),[2] a city water plant employee and Democratic precinct captain, and Marian Shields Robinson (1937‚Äì2024), a secretary at Spiegel's catalog store.[3] Her mother was a full-time homemaker until Michelle entered high school.[4] The Robinson and Shields families trace their roots to pre-Civil War African Americans in the American South.[2] On her father's side, she is descended from the Gullah people of South Carolina's Lowcountry region.[5] Her paternal great-great-grandfather, Jim Robinson, was born into slavery in 1850 on Friendfield Plantation, near Georgetown, South Carolina.[6][7] He became a freedman at age 15 after the war. Some of Obama's paternal family still reside in the Georgetown area.[8][9] Her grandfather, Fraser Robinson Jr., built his own house in South Carolina. He and his wife LaVaughn (n√©e Johnson) returned to the Lowcountry from Chicago after retirement.[6] Among her maternal ancestors was her great-great-great-grandmother, Melvinia Dosey Shields,[10] born into slavery in South Carolina but sold to Henry Walls Shields, who had a 200-acre farm in Clayton County, Georgia, near Atlanta. Melvinia's first son, Adolphus T. Shields, was biracial and born into slavery around 1860. Based on DNA and other evidence, in 2012, researchers said his father was likely 20-year-old Charles Marion Shields, son of Melvinia's master. They may have had a continuing relationship, as she had two more mixed-race children and lived near Shields after emancipation, taking his surname (she later changed her surname).[11] As was often the case, Melvinia did not talk to relatives about Dolphus's father.[12] Dolphus Shields, with his wife Alice, moved to Birmingham, Alabama, after the Civil War. They were great-great-grandparents of Robinson, whose grandparents had moved to Chicago.[12] Other of their children's lines migrated to Cleveland, Ohio, in the 20th century.[11] All four of Robinson's grandparents had multiracial ancestors, reflecting the complex history of the United States. Her extended family has said that people did not talk about the era of slavery when they were growing up.[11] Her distant ancestry includes Irish, English, and Native American roots.[13] Among her contemporary extended family is Rabbi Capers Funnye, her first cousin once removed born in Georgetown, South Carolina. Funnye is the son of her paternal grandfather's sister and her husband, and he is about 12 years older than Michelle. He converted to Judaism after college.[14][15] Robinson's childhood home was on the upper floor of 7436 South Euclid Avenue in Chicago's South Shore community area, which her parents rented from her great-aunt, who had the first floor.[3][16][17][18] She was raised in what she describes as a \"conventional\" home, with \"the mother at home, the father works, you have dinner around the table\".[19] Her elementary school was down the street. She and her family enjoyed playing games such as Monopoly, reading, and frequently saw extended family on both sides.[20] She played piano,[21] learning from her great-aunt, who was a piano teacher.[22] The Robinsons attended services at nearby South Shore United Methodist Church.[16] They used to vacation in a rustic cabin in White Cloud, Michigan.[16] She and her 21-month-older brother, Craig, skipped the second grade.[3][23] Robinson's father suffered from multiple sclerosis, which had a profound effect on her. Subsequently, she was determined to stay out of trouble and perform well in school.[24] By sixth grade, Michelle joined a gifted class at Bryn Mawr Elementary School (later renamed Bouchet Academy).[25] She attended Whitney Young High School,[26] Chicago's first magnet high school, established as a selective enrollment school, where she was a classmate of Jesse Jackson's daughter Santita.[20] The round-trip commute from the Robinsons' South Side home to the Near West Side, where the school was located, took three hours.[27] Michelle recalled being fearful of how others would perceive her, but disregarded any negativity around her and used it \"to fuel me, to keep me going\".[28][29] She recalled facing gender discrimination growing up, saying, for example, that rather than asking her for her opinion on a given subject, people commonly tended to ask what her older brother thought.[30] She was on the honor roll for four years, took advanced placement classes, was a member of the National Honor Society, and served as student council treasurer.[3] She graduated in 1981 as the salutatorian of her class.[27] Robinson was inspired to follow her brother to Princeton University, which she entered in 1981.[31][4] She majored in sociology and minored in African-American studies, graduating cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in 1985 after completing a 99-page senior thesis titled Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community under the supervision of Walter Wallace.[32][3][33] Robinson recalls that some of her teachers in high school tried to dissuade her from applying, and that she had been warned against \"setting my sights too high\".[34][35] She believed her brother's status as a student in good standing (he graduated in 1983) might have helped her during the admission process,[36] but she was resolved to demonstrate her own worth.[37] She has said she was overwhelmed during her first year, attributing this to the fact that neither of her parents had graduated from college,[38] and that she had never spent time on a college campus.[39] The mother of a white roommate reportedly tried to get her daughter reassigned because of Michelle's race.[31] Robinson said being at Princeton was the first time she became more aware of her ethnicity and, despite the willingness of her classmates and teachers to reach out to her, she still felt \"like a visitor on campus\".[40][41] There were also issues of economic class. \"I remember being shocked,\" she says, \"by college students who drove BMWs. I didn't even know parents who drove BMWs.\"[27] While at Princeton, Robinson became involved with the Third World Center (now known as the Carl A. Fields Center), an academic and cultural group who supported minority students. She ran their daycare center, which also offered after-school tutoring for older children.[42] She challenged the teaching methodology for French because she felt it should be more conversational.[43] As part of her requirements for graduation, she wrote a sociology thesis, entitled Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community.[44][45] She researched her thesis by sending a questionnaire to African-American graduates, asking that they specify when and how comfortable they were with their race prior to their enrollment at Princeton and how they felt about it when they were a student and since then. Of the 400 alumni to whom she sent the survey, fewer than 90 responded. Her findings did not support her hope that the black alumni would still identify with the African-American community, even though they had attended an elite university and had the advantages that accrue to its graduates.[46] Robinson pursued professional study, earning her Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from Harvard Law School in 1988.[47] By the time she applied for Harvard Law, biographer Bond wrote, her confidence had increased: \"This time around, there was no doubt in her mind that she had earned her place\".[46] Her faculty mentor at Harvard Law was Charles Ogletree, who has said she had answered the question that had plagued her throughout Princeton by the time she arrived at Harvard Law: whether she would remain the product of her parents or keep the identity she had acquired at Princeton; she had concluded she could be \"both brilliant and black\".[48] At Harvard, Robinson participated in demonstrations advocating the hiring of professors who were members of minority groups.[49] She worked for the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, assisting low-income tenants with housing cases.[50] She is the third first lady with a postgraduate degree, after her two immediate predecessors, Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush.[51] She later said her education gave her opportunities beyond what she had ever imagined.[52] Michelle's mother, Marian Robinson, was a stay-at-home mother.[53] Her father was Fraser C. Robinson III, who worked at the city's water purification plant.[53] Robinson's father, Fraser, died from complications from his illness in March 1991.[54] She would later say that although he was the \"hole in my heart\" and \"loss in my scar\", the memory of her father has motivated her each day since.[39] Her friend Suzanne Alele died from cancer around this time as well. These losses made her think of her contributions toward society and how well she was influencing the world from her law firm in her first job after law school. She considered this a turning point.[55] Robinson met Barack Obama when they were among the few African Americans at their law firm, Sidley Austin LLP (she has sometimes said only two, although others have noted that there were others in different departments).[56] She was assigned to mentor him while he was a summer associate.[57] Their relationship started with a business lunch and then a community organization meeting where he first impressed her.[58] Before meeting Obama, Michelle had told her mother she intended to focus solely on her career.[59] The couple's first date was to Spike Lee's movie Do the Right Thing (1989).[60] Barack Obama has said the couple had an \"opposites attract\" scenario in their initial interest in each other since Michelle had stability from her two-parent home while he was \"adventurous\".[61] They married on October 3, 1992.[58] After suffering a miscarriage, Michelle underwent in vitro fertilisation[62] to conceive their daughters Malia Ann (born 1998) and Natasha (known as Sasha, born 2001).[63] The Obama family lived on Chicago's South Side, where Barack taught at the University of Chicago Law School. He was elected to the state senate in 1996 and to the U.S. Senate in 2004. They chose to keep their residence in Chicago after Barack's election rather than to move to Washington, DC, as they felt it was better for their daughters. Throughout her husband's 2008 campaign for U.S. president, Obama made a \"commitment to be away overnight only once a week ‚Äì to campaign only two days a week and be home by the end of the second day\" for their two daughters.[64] She once requested that her then-fianc√© meet her prospective boss, Valerie Jarrett, when considering her first career move;[19] Jarrett became one of her husband's closest advisors.[65][66] The marital relationship has had its ebbs and flows; the combination of an evolving family life and beginning political career led to many arguments about balancing work and family. Barack Obama wrote in his second book, The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream, that \"Tired and stressed, we had little time for conversation, much less romance.\"[67] Despite their family obligations and careers, they continued to try to schedule \"date nights\" while they lived in Chicago.[68] The Obamas' daughters attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, a private school.[69] As a member of the school's board, Michelle fought to maintain diversity in the school when other board members connected with the University of Chicago tried to reserve more slots for children of the university faculty. This resulted in a plan to expand the school to increase enrollment.[4] In Washington, DC, Malia and Sasha attended Sidwell Friends School, after also considering Georgetown Day School.[70][71] In 2008, Michelle said in an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that they did not intend to have any more children.[72] The Obamas received advice from past first ladies Laura Bush, Rosalynn Carter, and Hillary Clinton about raising children in the White House.[71] Marian Robinson, Michelle's mother, moved in to the White House to assist with child care.[73] Obama was raised United Methodist and joined the Trinity United Church of Christ, a mostly black congregation of the Reformed denomination known as the United Church of Christ. She and Barack Obama were married there by Rev. Jeremiah Wright. On May 31, 2008, Barack and Michelle Obama announced that they had withdrawn their membership in Trinity United Church of Christ saying: \"Our relations with Trinity have been strained by the divisive statements of Reverend Wright, which sharply conflict with our own views.\"[74] The Obama family attended several different Protestant churches after moving to Washington D.C. in 2009, including Shiloh Baptist Church and St. John's Episcopal Church on Lafayette Square, known as the Presidents' Church. At the 49th African Methodist Episcopal Church's general conference, Michelle Obama encouraged the attendees to advocate for political awareness, saying, \"To anyone who says that church is no place to talk about these issues, you tell them there is no place better ‚Äì no place better, because ultimately, these are not just political issues ‚Äì they are moral issues, they're issues that have to do with human dignity and human potential, and the future we want for our kids and our grandkids.\"[75] Following law school, Obama became an associate at the Chicago office of the law firm Sidley & Austin, where she met her future husband Barack. At the firm, she worked on marketing and intellectual property law.[3] She continues to hold her law license, but as she no longer needs it for her work, she has kept it on a voluntary inactive status since 1993.[76][77] In 1991, she held public sector positions in the Chicago city government as an assistant to the mayor and as the assistant commissioner of planning and development. In 1993, she became executive director for the Chicago office of Public Allies, a non-profit organization encouraging young people to work on social issues in nonprofit groups and government agencies.[26] She worked there nearly four years and set fundraising records for the organization that stood twelve years after she had left.[20] Obama later said she had never been happier in her life prior to working \"to build Public Allies\".[78] In 1996, Obama served as the associate dean of student services at the University of Chicago, where she developed the university's Community Service Center.[79] In 2002, she began working for the University of Chicago Hospitals, first as executive director for community affairs and, beginning May 2005, as vice president for community and external affairs.[80] She continued to hold the University of Chicago Hospitals position during the primary campaign of 2008 but cut back to part-time in order to spend time with her daughters as well as work for her husband's election.[81] She subsequently took a leave of absence from her job.[82] According to the couple's 2006 income tax return, her salary was $273,618 from the University of Chicago Hospitals, while her husband had a salary of $157,082 from the United States Senate. The Obamas' total income was $991,296, which included $51,200 that she earned as a member of the board of directors of TreeHouse Foods and investments and royalties from his books.[83] Obama served as a salaried board member of TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (NYSE: THS),[84] a major Wal-Mart supplier from shortly after her husband was seated in the Senate until she cut ties shortly after her husband announced his candidacy for the presidency; he criticized Wal-Mart labor policies at an AFL‚ÄìCIO forum in Trenton, New Jersey, on May 14, 2007.[85] She also served on the board of directors of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.[86] In 2021, the former first lady announced that she has been \"moving toward retirement\".[87] Though she continues to be active in political campaigns, the former first lady has said she is reducing the amount of work to spend more time with her husband.[87] During an interview in 1996, Michelle Obama acknowledged there was a \"strong possibility\" her husband would begin a political career, but said she was \"wary\" of the process. She knew it meant their lives would be subject to scrutiny and she was intensely private.[88] Although she campaigned on her husband's behalf since early in his political career by handshaking and fund-raising, she did not relish the activity at first. When she campaigned during her husband's 2000 run for United States House of Representatives, her boss at the University of Chicago asked if there was any single thing about campaigning that she enjoyed; after some thought, she replied that visiting so many living rooms had given her some new decorating ideas.[89][90] Obama opposed her husband's run for the congressional seat, and, after his defeat, she preferred he tend to the financial needs of the family in what she deemed a more practical way.[91] At first, Obama had reservations about her husband's presidential campaign, due to fears about a possible negative effect on their daughters.[92] She says that she negotiated an agreement in which her husband was to quit smoking in exchange for her support of his decision to run.[93] About her role in her husband's presidential campaign, she has said: \"My job is not a senior adviser\".[65][94][95] During the campaign, she discussed race and education by using motherhood as a framework.[43] In May 2007, three months after her husband declared his presidential candidacy, Obama reduced her professional responsibilities by 80 percent to support his presidential campaign.[19] Early in the campaign, she had limited involvement, traveling to political events only two days a week and rarely traveling overnight;[96] by early February 2008, her participation had increased significantly. She attended thirty-three events in eight days.[66] She made several campaign appearances with Oprah Winfrey.[97][98] She wrote her own stump speeches for her husband's presidential campaign and generally spoke without notes.[27] During the campaign, columnist Cal Thomas on Fox News described Michelle Obama as an \"Angry Black Woman\"[99][100][101] and some websites attempted to promote this image.[102] Obama said: \"Barack and I have been in the public eye for many years now, and we've developed a thick skin along the way. When you're out campaigning, there will always be criticism. I just take it in stride, and at the end of the day, I know that it comes with the territory.\"[103] By the time of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in August, media outlets observed that her presence on the campaign trail had grown softer than at the start of the race, focusing on soliciting concerns and empathizing with the audience rather than throwing down challenges to them, and giving interviews to shows such as The View and publications like Ladies' Home Journal rather than appearing on news programs. The change was reflected in her fashion choices, as she wore clothes that were more informal clothes than her earlier designer pieces.[89] Partly intended to help soften her public image,[99] her appearance on The View was widely covered in the press.[104] The presidential campaign was Obama's first exposure to the national political scene; she was considered the least famous of the candidates' spouses.[94] Early in the campaign, she told anecdotes about Obama family life; however, as the press began to emphasize her sarcasm, she toned it down.[83][93] New York Times op-ed columnist Maureen Dowd wrote: I wince a bit when Michelle Obama chides her husband as a mere mortal ‚Äì a comic routine that rests on the presumption that we see him as a god ... But it may not be smart politics to mock him in a way that turns him from the glam JFK into the mundane Gerald Ford, toasting his own English muffin. If all Senator Obama is peddling is the Camelot mystique, why debunk this mystique?[94][105] On the first night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Craig Robinson introduced his younger sister.[106] She delivered her speech, during which she sought to portray herself and her family as the embodiment of the American Dream.[107] Obama said she and her husband believe \"that you work hard for what you want in life, that your word is your bond, and you do what you say you're going to do, that you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you don't know them, and even if you don't agree with them.\"[108] She also emphasized loving her country, likely responding to criticism for having said that she felt \"proud of her country for the first time\".[107][109][110] The first statement was seen as a gaffe.[111] Her keynote address was largely well-received and drew mostly positive reviews.[112] A Rasmussen Reports poll found that her favorability among Americans reached 55%, the highest for her.[113] On an October 6, 2008, broadcast, Larry King asked Obama if the American electorate was past the Bradley effect. She said her husband's winning the nomination was a fairly strong indicator that it was.[114] The same night she was interviewed by Jon Stewart on The Daily Show, where she deflected criticism of her husband and his campaign.[115] On Fox News' America's Pulse, E. D. Hill referred to the fist bump shared by the Obamas the night he clinched the Democratic presidential nomination, describing it as a \"terrorist fist jab\". Hill was taken off air, and the show was canceled.[116][117] Obama campaigned for her husband's re-election in 2012. Beginning in 2011, Obama became more politically active than she had been since the 2008 election, though avoided discussions about the re-election bid.[118] By the time of the election cycle, she had developed a more open public image.[119][120] Some commentators viewed her as the most popular member of the Obama administration,[121] noting that her poll approval numbers had not dropped below 60% since she entered the White House.[122] An Obama senior campaign official said she was \"the most popular political figure in America\".[123] The positive assessment was reasoned to have contributed to her active role in the re-election campaign, but it was noted that the challenge for the Obama campaign was to use her without tarnishing her popularity. Obama was considered a polarizing figure, having aroused both \"sharp enmity and deep loyalty\" from Americans, but she was also seen as having improved her image since 2008 when her husband first ran for the presidency.[121] Isabel Wilkinson of The Daily Beast said Obama's fashion style changed over the course of the campaign to be sensitive and economical.[124] Prior to the first debate of the election cycle, Obama expressed confidence in her husband's debating skills.[125] He was later criticized for appearing detached and for looking down when addressing Romney.[126][127] Consensus among uncommitted voters was that the latter had won the debate.[128] After Obama's speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, the first lady was found through a CBS News/New York Times poll conducted in September to have a 61% favorably rating with registered voters, the highest percentage she had polled since April 2009.[129] Obama aimed to humanize her husband by relating stories about him, attempting to appeal to female voters in swing states. Paul Harris of The Guardian said the same tactic was being used by Ann Romney, wife of 2012 Republican candidate Mitt Romney. Polls in October showed their husbands tied at 47% for the female vote. However, Michelle Obama's favorability ratings remained higher than Ann Romney's at 69% to 52%.[130] Despite Obama's higher poll numbers, comparisons between Obama and Romney were repeatedly made by the media until the election.[131][132] But, as Michelle Cottle of Newsweek wrote, \"... nobody votes for first lady.\"[133] During her early months as First Lady, Obama visited homeless shelters and soup kitchens.[134] She also sent representatives to schools and advocated public service.[134][135] Obama advocated for her husband's policy priorities by promoting bills that support it. She hosted a White House reception for women's rights advocates in celebration of the enactment of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 Pay equity law. She supported the economic stimulus bill in visits to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and United States Department of Education. Some observers looked favorably upon her legislative activities, while others said she should be less involved in politics. According to her representatives, she intended to visit all United States Cabinet-level agencies in order to get acquainted with Washington.[136] On June 5, 2009, the White House announced that Michelle Obama was replacing her then chief of staff, Jackie Norris, with Susan Sher, a longtime friend and adviser. Norris became a senior adviser to the Corporation for National and Community Service.[137] Another key aide, Spelman College alumna Kristen Jarvis, served from 2008 until 2015, when she left to become chief of staff to the Ford Foundation president Darren Walker. In 2009, Obama was named Barbara Walters's Most Fascinating Person of the year.[138] In her memoir, Becoming, Obama describes her four primary initiatives as first lady: Let's Move!, Reach Higher,[139] Let Girls Learn,[140] and Joining Forces.[141] Some initiatives of First Lady Michelle Obama included advocating on behalf of military families, helping working women balance career and family, encouraging national service, and promoting the arts and arts education.[142][143] Obama made supporting military families and spouses a personal mission and increasingly bonded with military families. According to her aides, stories of the sacrifice these families make moved her to tears.[143] In April 2012, Obama and her husband were awarded the Jerald Washington Memorial Founders' Award by the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans (NCHV). The award is the highest honor given to homeless veteran advocates.[144] Obama was again honored with the award in May 2015, accepting with Jill Biden.[145] In November 2013, a Politico article by Michelle Cottle accusing Obama of being a \"feminist nightmare\" for not using her position and education to advocate for women's issues was sharply criticized across the political spectrum.[146][147][148] Cottle quoted Linda Hirshman saying of Obama's trendy styles, promotion of gardening and healthy eating, and support of military families that \"She essentially became the English lady of the manor, Tory Party, circa 1830s.\"[146] A prominent critic of Cottle was MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry, who rhetorically asked \"Are you serious?\"[147][148] Supporters of Obama note that the first lady had been one of the only people in the administration to address obesity, through promoting good eating habits, which is one of the leading U.S. public health crises.[149] In May 2014, Obama joined the campaign to bring back school girls who had been kidnapped in Nigeria. The first lady tweeted a picture of herself holding a poster with the #bringbackourgirls campaign hashtag.[150] Obama writes in her book about enlisting help for her initiative Let Girls Learn to produce and sing the song \"This is for My Girls\".[151] Over the course of the Obama presidency, particularly during the second term, Michelle Obama was subject to speculation over whether she would run for the presidency herself, similarly to predecessor Hillary Clinton.[152] A May 2015 Rasmussen poll found Obama had 22% of support to Clinton's 56% of winning the Democratic nomination, higher than that of potential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Martin O'Malley, and Bernie Sanders.[153][154] Another poll that month found that 71% of Americans believed Obama should not run for the presidency, only 14% approving.[154] On January 14, 2016, during a town-hall meeting, President Obama was asked if the first lady could be talked into running. He responded, \"There are three things that are certain in life: death, taxes, and Michelle is not running for president. That I can tell you.\"[155][156] On March 16, 2016, while speaking in Austin, Texas, Obama denied that she would ever run for the office, citing a desire to \"impact as many people as possible in an unbiased way\".[157] In the epilogue to Becoming, Obama writes, \"I have no intention of running for office, ever,\"[158] recognizing that \"politics can be a means for positive change, but this arena is just not for me.\"[159] Obama's predecessors Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush supported the organic movement by instructing the White House kitchens to buy organic food. Obama extended their support of healthy eating by planting the White House Kitchen Garden, an organic garden, the first White House vegetable garden since Eleanor Roosevelt served as First Lady. She also had bee hives installed on the South Lawn of the White House. The garden supplied organic produce and honey for the meals of the First Family and for state dinners and other official gatherings.[160][161][162][163] In January 2010, Obama undertook her first lead role in an administration-wide initiative, which she named \"Let's Move!\", to make progress in reversing the 21st-century trend of childhood obesity.[162][164] On February 9, 2010, the first lady announced Let's Move! and President Barack Obama created the Task Force on Childhood Obesity to review all current programs and create a national plan for change.[165] Michelle Obama said her goal was to make this effort her legacy: \"I want to leave something behind that we can say, 'Because of this time that this person spent here, this thing has changed.' And my hope is that that's going to be in the area of childhood obesity.\"[162] Her 2012 book American Grown: The Story of the White House Kitchen Garden and Gardens Across America is based on her experiences with the garden and promotes healthy eating.[166] Her call for action on healthy eating was repeated by the United States Department of Defense, which has been facing an ever-expanding problem of obesity among recruits.[167] Several Republicans have critiqued or lampooned Obama's initiative. In October 2014, senator Rand Paul linked to Michelle Obama's Twitter account when announcing on the website that he was going to Dunkin' Donuts.[168] In January 2016, Chris Christie, Republican governor of New Jersey and presidential candidate, criticized the first lady's involvement with healthy eating while he was campaigning in Iowa, arguing that she was using the government to exercise her views on eating.[169][170] Obama had previously cited Christie as an example of an adult who struggled with obesity, a demographic that she sought to diminish by targeting children since Let's Move! was \"working with kids when they're young, so that they don't have these direct challenges when they get older.\"[171] In February, Senator Ted Cruz said that he would end Obama's health policies and return french fries to school cafeterias if his wife were first lady.[172] In the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign, Obama boasted to gay Democratic groups of her husband's record on LGBT rights: his support of the Illinois Human Rights Act, the Illinois gender violence act, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, repealing the \"Don't Ask Don't Tell\" policy, and full repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act, civil unions; along with hate crimes protection for sexual orientation and gender identity and renewed effort to fight HIV and AIDS. They have both opposed amendments proposed to ban same-sex marriage in the federal, California, and Florida constitutions. She said that the U.S. Supreme Court delivered justice in the Lawrence v. Texas case, and she drew a connection between the struggles for gay rights and civil rights by saying, \"We are all only here because of those who marched and bled and died, from Selma to Stonewall, in the pursuit of a more perfect union.\"[173][174][175] After the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell on September 20, 2011, Obama included openly gay service members in her national military families initiative.[176] On May 9, 2012, Barack and Michelle Obama came out publicly in favor of same-sex marriage. Prior to this, Michelle Obama had never publicly stated her position on this issue. Senior White House officials said Michelle Obama and Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett had been the two most consistent advocates for same-sex marriage in Barack Obama's life.[177] Michelle said: This is an important issue for millions of Americans, and for Barack and me, it really comes down to the values of fairness and equality we want to pass down to our girls. These are basic values that kids learn at a very young age and that we encourage them to apply in all areas of their lives. And in a country where we teach our children that everyone is equal under the law, discriminating against same-sex couples just isn't right. It's as simple as that.[178] At the 2012 DNC, Michelle said, \"Barack knows the American Dream because he's lived it ... and he wants everyone in this country to have that same opportunity, no matter who we are, or where we're from, or what we look like, or who we love.\"[179] In May 2009, Obama delivered the commencement speech at a graduating ceremony at UC Merced in Merced County, California, the address being praised afterward by students who found her relatable. Kevin Fagan of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that there was chemistry between Obama and the students.[180] In August 2013, Obama attended the 50th anniversary ceremony for the March on Washington at the Lincoln Memorial. Positive attention was brought to Obama's attire, a black sleeveless dress with red flowers, designed by Tracy Reese.[181][182] Reese reacted by releasing a public statement that she was honored the first lady \"would choose to wear one of our designs during the celebration of such a deeply significant historical moment\".[183][184] In March 2015, Obama traveled to Selma, Alabama, with her family to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery marches.[185] After President Obama's remarks there, the Obamas joined original marchers, including John Lewis, in crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge.[186][187] In July 2015, Obama journeyed to Coachella Valley while coming to Los Angeles for that year's Special Olympics World Games.[188] In October 2015, Obama was joined by Jill Biden and Prince Harry in visiting a military base in Fort Belvoir, Virginia, in an attempt on the prince's part to raise awareness to programs supporting harmed service members.[189] In December 2015, Obama traveled with her husband to San Bernardino, California, to meet with families of the victims of a terrorist attack that occurred two weeks earlier.[190] On April 1, 2009, Obama met with Queen Elizabeth II in Buckingham Palace. Obama embraced her before attending an event with world leaders.[191] Obama praised her, though the hug generated controversy for being out of protocol when greeting Elizabeth.[192][193] In April 2010, Obama traveled to Mexico, her first solo visit to a nation.[194] In Mexico, Obama spoke to students, encouraging them to take responsibility for their futures.[195][196] Referring to the underprivileged children, Obama argued that \"potential can be found in some of the most unlikely places,\" citing herself and her husband as examples.[197][198] Obama traveled to Africa for the second official trip in June 2011, touring Johannesburg, Cape Town and Botswana and meeting with Gra√ßa Machel. Obama was also involved with community events in the foreign countries.[199] It was commented by White House staff that her trip to Africa would advance the foreign policy of her husband.[200][201] In March 2014, Obama visited China along with her two daughters Malia and Sasha, and her mother Marian Robinson. She met with Peng Liyuan, the wife of Chinese president Xi Jinping, visited historic and cultural sites, as well as a university and two high schools.[202][203] Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said the visit and intent in Obama journeying there was to symbolize \"the relationship between the United States and China is not just between leaders, it's a relationship between peoples.\"[204][205] In January 2015, Obama traveled to Saudi Arabia alongside her husband, following the death of King Abdullah. She received criticism for not covering her head in a nation where women are forbidden from publicly not doing so,[206][207] though Obama was defended for being a foreigner and thus not having to submit to Saudi Arabia's customs,[208] even being praised in some corners.[209] Obama was neither greeted nor acknowledged by King Salman during the encounter.[210] In June 2015, Obama undertook a weeklong trip to London and three Italian cities. In London, she spoke with students about international education for adolescent girls and met with both British prime minister David Cameron and Prince Harry. She was joined by her two daughters and mother.[211] In November, she spent a week in Qatar, her first official visit to the Middle East. She continued advancing her initiative for international education for women by speaking at the 2015 World Innovation Summit for Education for her \"Let Girls Learn\" initiative in Doha, Qatar, and touring a school in Amman, Jordan, where she met with female students.[30][212][213] During the Qatar trip, Obama had intended to visit Jordan as well, but the trip was canceled due to weather conditions. In Jordan, Obama had intended to visit an Amman school that had been constructed with assistance from U.S. funds.[214] In March 2016, Obama accompanied her husband and children to Cuba in a trip that was seen by the administration as having the possibility of positively impacting relations between the country and America.[215][216] Later that month, the first couple and their daughters traveled to Argentina,[217] meeting with Argentine president Mauricio Macri.[218][219] Obama campaigned for Democratic candidates in the 2010 midterm elections,[220][221] making her debut on the campaign trail in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.[222][223] By the time she began campaigning, Obama's approval rating was 20 percentage points higher than her husband's.[224] Though Obama indicated in January 2010 that a consensus had not been made about whether she would campaign,[225] speculation of her involvement came from her large approval rating as well as reports that she had been invited to speak at events with Democrats such as Barbara Boxer, Mary Jo Kilroy and Joe Sestak.[226] She toured seven states in two weeks within October 2010.[227] Aides reported that, though viewed as essential by the White House, she would not become deeply involved with political discussions nor engage Republicans in public disputes.[228] After the elections, only six of the thirteen Democratic candidates Obama had campaigned for won. The Los Angeles Times concluded that while Obama was indeed more popular than her husband, her \"election scorecard proved no better than his, particularly in her home state\".[229] Obama was a participant in the 2014 midterm elections, held at a time where her popularity superseded her husband's to such an extent that it was theorized she would receive a much larger outpour of support in campaigning. Reporting her travel to Denver, Colorado, David Lightman wrote that while Democrats did not want President Obama to campaign for them, \"the first lady is very popular.\"[230] In May 2014, Obama was found to have a 61% favorable approval rating from a CNN poll, her husband coming in at 43%.[231] In a video released in July, as part of an effort to encourage voter turnout, she called on voters to be \"hungry as you were back in 2008 and 2012\".[232] Obama appeared at a fundraiser in Georgia in September for Democratic senate candidate Michelle Nunn. Obama's approach to campaigning in Georgia strayed from discussing current events and instead broadly stressed the importance of registering to vote and turning out during the elections.[231] Obama's infrequent appearances came from her dislike of being away from her children and Washington politics as well as her distaste for the opposition by Republicans to her husband's agenda and her view that Democrats in the U.S. Senate had not sufficiently been supporters of her initiatives to end childhood obesity.[233] Obama raised her profile in October,[234][235] touring three states in four days.[233] Obama called the elections her husband's \"last campaign\".[236][237] Obama endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and made several high-profile speeches in favor of her, including an address at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.[238] She also appeared multiple times on the campaign trail in either solo or joint appearances with Clinton.[239] On October 13, 2016, Obama heavily criticized Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for the statements he made in a 2005 audio recording while at a Clinton rally in Manchester, New Hampshire.[240] A week later, Trump attempted to revive past comments Obama made in regard to Clinton during the 2008 presidential election.[241][242] With the ascent of her husband as a prominent national politician, Obama became a part of popular culture. In May 2006, Essence listed her among \"25 of the World's Most Inspiring Women\".[243][244] In July 2007, Vanity Fair listed her among \"10 of the World's Best Dressed People\". She was an honorary guest at Oprah Winfrey's Legends Ball as a \"young'un\" paying tribute to the \"Legends\" who helped pave the way for African-American women. In September 2007, 02138 magazine listed her 58th of \"The Harvard 100\"; a list of the prior year's most influential Harvard alumni. Her husband was ranked fourth.[243][245] In July 2008, she made a repeat appearance on the Vanity Fair international best dressed list.[246] She also appeared on the 2008 People list of best-dressed women and was praised by the magazine for her \"classic and confident\" look.[247][248] At the time of her husband's election, some sources anticipated that as a high-profile African-American woman in a stable marriage Obama would be a positive role model who would influence the view the world has of African Americans.[249][250] Her fashion choices were part of the 2009 Fashion week,[251] but Obama's influence in the field did not have the impact on the paucity of African-American models who participate, that some thought it might.[252][253] Obama's public support grew in her early months as First Lady,[134][254] as she was accepted as a role model.[134] On her first trip abroad in April 2009, she toured a cancer ward with Sarah Brown, wife of British prime minister Gordon Brown.[255] Newsweek described her first trip abroad as an exhibition of her so-called \"star power\"[254] and MSN described it as a display of sartorial elegance.[244] Questions were raised by some in the American and British media regarding protocol when the Obamas met Queen Elizabeth II[256] and Michelle reciprocated a touch on her back by the Queen during a reception, purportedly against traditional royal etiquette.[256][257] Palace sources denied that any breach in etiquette had occurred.[258] Obama has been compared to Jacqueline Kennedy due to her sense of style[246] and also to Barbara Bush for her discipline and decorum.[259][260] Obama's style has been described as \"fashion populist\".[51] In 2010, she wore clothes, many high end, from more than fifty design companies with less expensive pieces from J.Crew and Target, and the same year a study found that her patronage was worth an average of $14 million to a company.[261] She became a fashion trendsetter, in particular favoring sleeveless dresses, including her first-term official portrait in a dress by Michael Kors and her ball gowns designed by Jason Wu for both inaugurals.[262] She has also been known for wearing clothes by African designers such as Mimi Plange, Duro Olowu, Maki Oh, and Osei Duro, and styles such as the Adire fabric.[263][264] Obama appeared on the cover and in a photo spread in the March 2009 issue of Vogue.[265][266] Every first lady since Lou Hoover (except Bess Truman) has been in Vogue,[265] but only Hillary Clinton had previously appeared on the cover.[267] Obama later appeared two more times on the cover of Vogue, while First Lady, the last time in December 2016, with photographs by Annie Leibovitz.[268] In August 2011, she became the first woman ever to appear on the cover of Better Homes and Gardens magazine, and the first person in 48 years.[269] In 2013, during the 85th Academy Awards, she became the first first lady to announce the winner of an Oscar (Best Picture, which went to Argo).[270] The media have been criticized for focusing more on the first lady's fashion sense than her serious contributions.[51][271] She said after the 2008 election that she would like to focus attention as First Lady on issues of concern to military and working families.[249][272][273] In 2008, U.S. News & World Report blogger, PBS host and Scripps Howard columnist Bonnie Erb√© argued that Obama's own publicists seemed to be feeding the emphasis on style over substance,[274] and said Obama was miscasting herself by overemphasizing style.[73][275] For three straight years ‚Äì 2018, 2019, and 2020 ‚Äì Obama topped the Gallup poll asking who is the \"most admired woman\" in the U.S.[276][277] Time magazine features an annual \"Person of the Year\" cover story in which Time recognizes the individual or group of individuals who have had the biggest impact on news headlines over the previous twelve months. In 2020, the magazine decided to retroactively choose a historically deserving woman for each year in which a man had been named Person of the Year, reflecting the fact that a woman or women had been named Person of the Year only eleven times in the preceding hundred. As part of this review, Michelle Obama was named the Woman of the Year for 2008.[278] In May 2017, during an appearance at the Partnership for a Healthier America conference, Obama rebuked the Trump administration for its delay of a federal requirement designed to increase the nutritional standards for school lunches.[279] In June, while attending the WWDC in Silicon Valley, California, Obama called for tech companies to add women for the diversifying of their ranks.[280] In July, Obama honored Eunice Shriver at the 2017 ESPY Awards.[281] In September, Obama delivered an address at the tech conference in Utah charging the Trump administration with having a fearful White House,[282] appeared in a video for the Global Citizens Festival advocating more attention to giving young girls an education,[283] and attended the Inbound 2017 conference in Boston.[284] During an October 3 appearance at the Philadelphia Conference for Women, Obama cited a lack of diversity in politics with contributing to lawmakers being distrusted by other groups.[285] In November, Obama discussed gender disparity in attitudes with Elizabeth Alexander while attending the Obama Foundation Summit in Chicago,[286] and spoke at the Bushnell Center for the Performing Arts in Hartford, Connecticut.[287] In April 2018, Obama responded to speculation that she might be running for president by saying she has \"never had the passion for politics\" and that \"there are millions of women who are inclined and do have the passion for politics.\"[288] On January 2, 2021, Obama encouraged Georgia residents to vote in the state's runoff in the U.S. Senate election and to contact VoteRiders, a non-profit voter ID education organization, to make sure they have the necessary ID to vote.[289] On January 20, 2021, Obama and her husband attended the inauguration of Joe Biden. Michelle Obama wore a matching plum coat, sweater, pants, and belt designed by Sergio Hudson to the inauguration.[290] In 2021, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.[291] On April 28, 2023, Obama, along with actress Kate Capshaw, joined Bruce Springsteen on stage during his show in Barcelona where they provided backing vocals and tambourine on Springsteen's song \"Glory Days\".[292] Amid media speculation over the candidacy of President Biden, Obama's office announced in March 2024 that she would not be running for president in the 2024 United States presidential election.[293] According to a Reuters/Ipsos public opinion poll among 892 registered voters released on July 2, 2024, Michelle Obama was the only listed Democrat option who would defeat Trump in a confrontation, with 50% of the votes for Obama versus 39% for Trump. 55% of the voters also had a favourable view of Obama versus 42% toward Trump.[294][295] On August 20, 2024, Obama gave the next-to-last address on the second night of the 2024 Democratic National Convention and then introduced the final speaker, her husband, former president Barack Obama. The New York Times called her speech \"electrifying\" and suggested she had outshone her husband.[296] Obama's memoir, Becoming, was released in November 2018.[297] By November 2019, it had sold 11.5 million copies.[298] A documentary titled Becoming, which chronicles Obama's book tour promoting the memoir, was released on Netflix on May 6, 2020.[299][300] She received the Grammy Award for Best Audio Book, Narration & Storytelling Recording in 2020.[301] In July 2020, she premiered a podcast titled The Michelle Obama Podcast.[302][303] In February 2021, Obama was announced as an executive producer and presenter on a children's cooking show, Waffles + Mochi.[304] It was released by Netflix on March 16, 2021.[305][306] On September 11, 2021, the Obamas attended a 9/11 memorial to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the attacks.[307] More recently, Regina Hicks had signed a deal with Netflix alongside her and Barack's Higher Ground production company to develop comedies.[308] She received two Children's and Family Emmy Awards at the 1st Children's and Family Emmy Awards: for Outstanding Short Form Program (We the People) and Outstanding Preschool Animated Series (Ada Twist, Scientist).[309] Obama has made occasional guest appearances on TV shows, often portraying herself: iCarly in 2012, Parks and Recreation in 2014, NCIS in 2016, and Black-ish in 2022. She received a Black Reel Awards for Television nomination for Outstanding Guest Actress, Comedy Series for her role in Black-ish.[310] She produced the documentary film Crip Camp (2020) and the biographical drama film Rustin (2023). On July 21, 2022, it was announced that Obama's next book, The Light We Carry: Overcoming in Uncertain Times, would be published in November 2022.[311] The book was published by Penguin Random House.[312] In 2023, Obama received Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Hosted Nonfiction Series or Special nomination at the 75th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards for the Netflix documentary film The Light We Carry: Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey.[313] In November 2023, Obama was named to the BBC's 100 Women list.[314]",

Through her four main initiatives, she became a role model for women and an advocate for healthy families, service members and their families, higher education, and international adolescent girls education. Each of us also comes here tonight,‚Äù Michelle Obama told the Democratic National Convention in 2008, ‚Äúby way of our own improbable journey‚Äù and ‚Äúdriven by a simple belief that . . . we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be.‚Äù Michelle Obama‚Äôs journey began in the South Side of Chicago, where Fraser and Marian Robinson instilled in their daughter a heartfelt commitment to family, hard work, and education. Her father was a pump operator for the Chicago Water Department, while her mother stayed at home to care for Michelle and her older brother Craig. As she watched her father refuse to give in to multiple sclerosis, use two canes to get to his job, and save money to send her to college, she learned that ‚Äúthe only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them.‚Äù Michelle earned a bachelor‚Äôs degree from Princeton University and a juris doctor degree from Harvard Law School. In 1988, she returned to Chicago to join the firm of Sidley Austin. It was there that she met Barack Obama, a summer associate she was assigned to advise. They were married in 1992. By that time Michelle had turned her energies to public service. She was assistant commissioner of planning and development in Chicago‚Äôs City Hall before becoming the founding executive director of the Chicago chapter of Public Allies, an AmeriCorps program that prepares young people for public service. In 1996, she joined the University of Chicago as associate dean of student services, where she developed the university‚Äôs first community service program. In 2002, she went to work for the University of Chicago Medical Center, where in 2005 she became the vice president of community and external affairs. During these years the Obamas‚Äô daughters Malia and Sasha were born. As first lady, Michelle Obama initiated Let‚Äôs Move! a program aiming to end childhood obesity within a generation. Through it, elected officials, business leaders, educators, parents, and faith leaders worked together to provide more nutritious food in schools, bring healthy and affordable food into underserved communities, plant vegetable gardens across America, and provide new opportunities for kids to be more active. Each year local schoolchildren helped plant and harvest the garden she started on the White House South Lawn. Its vegetables and fruits were served at the White House and donated to soup kitchens and food banks. During Barack Obama‚Äôs second term Michelle spearheaded the Reach Higher Initiative to help students understand job opportunities and the education and skills they need for those jobs. She encouraged young people to continue their education past high school in technical schools and community colleges as well as at colleges and universities. Worldwide, she championed the education of girls and women. In a commencement address at the City College of New York she told graduates, ‚ÄúNever view your challenges as obstacles.‚Äù It is a lesson she has embodied all her life. Throughout her time in the White House Mrs. Obama worked to support veterans and military families. She also focused her energies on what she calls her most important role: MominChief to her daughters, who grew into accomplished young women during their eight years in the White House.

She is the first African-American First Lady of the United States. Through her four main initiatives, she has become a role model for women and an advocate for healthy families, service members and their families, higher education, and international adolescent girls education. When people ask First Lady Michelle Obama to describe herself, she doesn't hesitate to say that first and foremost, she is Malia and Sasha's mom. But before she was a mother ‚Äî or a wife, lawyer, or public servant ‚Äî she was Fraser and Marian Robinson's daughter. The Robinsons lived in a brick bungalow on the South Side of Chicago. Fraser was a pump operator for the Chicago Water Department, and despite being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis at a young age, he hardly ever missed a day of work. Marian stayed home to raise Michelle and her older brother Craig, skillfully managing a busy household filled with love, laughter, and important life lessons. A product of Chicago public schools, Michelle Robinson studied sociology and African-American studies at Princeton University. After graduating from Harvard Law School in 1988, she joined the Chicago law firm Sidley & Austin, where she later met Barack Obama, the man who would become the love of her life. After a few years, Mrs. Obama decided her true calling was working with people to serve their communities and their neighbors. She served as assistant commissioner of planning and development in Chicago's City Hall before becoming the founding executive director of the Chicago chapter of Public Allies, an AmeriCorps program that prepares youth for public service. In 1996, Mrs. Obama joined the University of Chicago with a vision of bringing campus and community together. As Associate Dean of Student Services, she developed the university's first community service program, and under her leadership as Vice President of Community and External Affairs for the University of Chicago Medical Center, volunteerism skyrocketed. Mrs. Obama has continued her efforts to support and inspire young people during her time as First Lady. In 2010, she launched Let‚Äôs Move!, bringing together community leaders, educators, medical professionals, parents, and others in a nationwide effort to address the challenge of childhood obesity. Let‚Äôs Move! has an ambitious goal: to solve the epidemic of childhood obesity within a generation. Whether it's providing healthier food in our schools, helping kids be more physically active, or urging companies to market healthier foods to our children, Let‚Äôs Move! is focused on giving parents the support they need to make healthier choices for their kids. In 2011, Mrs. Obama and Dr. Jill Biden came together to launch Joining Forces, a nationwide initiative calling all Americans to rally around service members, veterans, and their families and support them through wellness, education, and employment opportunities. Joining Forces works hand in hand with the public and private sector to ensure that service members, veterans, and their families have the tools they need to succeed throughout their lives. In 2014, Mrs. Obama launched the Reach Higher Initiative, an effort to inspire young people across America to take charge of their future by completing their education past high school, whether at a professional training program, a community college, or a four-year college or university. Reach Higher aims to ensure that all students understand what they need to complete their education by working to expose students to college and career opportunities; helping them understand financial aid eligibility; encouraging academic planning and summer learning opportunities; and supporting high school counselors who do essential work to help students get into college. In 2015, Mrs. Obama joined President Obama to launch Let Girls Learn, a U.S. government-wide initiative to help girls around the world go to school and stay in school. As part of this effort, Mrs. Obama is calling on countries across the globe to help educate and empower young women, and she is sharing the stories and struggles of these young women with young people here at home to inspire them to commit to their own education. As First Lady, Mrs. Obama looks forward to continuing her work on the issues close to her heart ‚Äî supporting military families, helping children lead healthier lives, and encouraging all our young people to fulfill their boundless promise.",

She ran their daycare center, which also offered after school tutoring for older children.[15] As part of her requirements for graduation, she wrote a sociology thesis, titled Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community.[16][17] Robinson pursued professional study, earning her Juris Doctor degree from Harvard Law School in 1988.[18] At Harvard, Robinson participated in demonstrations advocating the hiring of professors who were members of minority groups.[19] She worked for the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, assisting low-income tenants with housing cases.[20] Following law school, Obama became an associate at the Chicago office of the law firm Sidley & Austin, where she worked on marketing and property law.[21] In 1993, she became executive director for the Chicago office of Public Allies, a non-profit organization encouraging young people to work on social issues in nonprofit groups and government agencies.[22] In 1996, Obama served as the Associate Dean of Student Services at the University of Chicago.[23] In 2002, she began working for the University of Chicago Hospitals, first as executive director for community affairs and, beginning May 2005, as vice president for Community and External Affairs.[24] Robinson met Barack Obama when they were among the few African Americans at their law firm, Sidley Austin LLP.[25] Their relationship started with a business lunch and then a community organization meeting.[26] They got married on October 3, 1992.[26] Their first daughter, Malia Ann was born in July 1998 and their second daughter, Sasha was born June 2001.[27] Obama became the first lady of the United States when her husband was sworn in as the 44th president on January 20, 2009. She became the first African-American first lady in American history. As first lady, Obama visited homeless shelters and soup kitchens.[28] She also sent representatives to schools and advocated public service.[28][29] Obama's initiatives as first lady were: Let's Move!, Reach Higher,[30] Let Girls Learn,[31] and Joining Forces.[32] Some initiatives included advocating for military families.[33][34] She made supporting military families and spouses a personal mission and increasingly bonded with military families.[34] In January 2010, Obama started an initiative, which she named \"Let's Move!\", to make progress in reversing the 21st-century trend of childhood obesity.[35][36] On February 9, 2010, President Barack Obama created the Task Force on Childhood Obesity to review all current programs and create a national plan for change.[37] In 2010, she wore clothes, many high end, from more than fifty designer companies.[38] She wore sleeveless dresses by Michael Kors, and her ball gowns designed by Jason Wu for both inaugurals.[39] She has also been known for wearing clothes by African designers such as Mimi Plange, Duro Olowu, Maki Oh, and Osei Duro.[40][41] Obama appeared on the cover in the March 2009 issue of Vogue.[42][43] She later appeared two more times on the cover of Vogue, while first lady, the last time in December 2016, with photographs by Annie Leibovitz.[44] In August 2011, she became the first woman ever to appear on the cover of Better Homes and Gardens magazine.[45] In 2021, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.[46] Obama's memoir, Becoming, was released in November 2018.[47] By November 2019, it had sold 11.5 million copies.[48] A documentary titled Becoming, which chronicles Obama's book tour promoting the memoir, was released on Netflix on May 6, 2020.[49][50] She received Grammy Award for Best Audio Book, Narration & Storytelling Recording in 2020 for audio book.[51] In July 2020, she premiered a podcast titled The Michelle Obama Podcast.[52][53] In February 2021, Obama was announced as an executive producer and presenter on a children's cooking show, Waffles + Mochi.[54] It was released by Netflix on March 16, 2021.[55][56] On July 21, 2022, it was announced that Obama's next book, The Light We Carry: Overcoming in Uncertain Times, would be published in November 2022.[57] The book was published by Penguin Random House.[58] In 2023, Obama received a Emmy Award for the Netflix documentary film The Light We Carry: Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey.[59] In November 2023, Obama was named to the BBC's 100 Women list.[60] Time magazine features an annual \"Person of the Year\" cover story in which Time recognizes the individual or group of individuals who have had the biggest impact on news headlines over the previous twelve months. In 2020, the magazine decided to retroactively choose a historically deserving woman for each year in which a man had been named Person of the Year, reflecting the fact that a woman or women had been named Person of the Year only eleven times in the preceding hundred. As part of this review, Michelle Obama was named the Woman of the Year for 2008.[62]",

                "title": "Anita Bryant - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Anita Jane Bryant (March 25, 1940 ‚Äì December 16, 2024) was an American singer and a Christian activist against gay rights in the United States. She had three top 20 hits in the United States in the early 1960s. She was the 1958 Miss Oklahoma beauty pageant winner, and a brand ambassador for the Florida Citrus Commission from 1969 to 1980. From 1977 to 1980, Bryant was an outspoken Christian opponent of gay rights in the United States. In 1977, she ran the Save Our Children campaign to repeal a local ordinance in Miami-Dade County, Florida, that outlawed discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Supporters of gay rights in the United States condemned Bryant for her campaign. They were assisted by many other prominent figures in music, film, and television, and retaliated by boycotting the orange juice that she promoted. Though the campaign ended successfully with a 69% majority vote to repeal the ordinance on June 7, 1977 (Dade County later restored the ordinance in 1998), it permanently damaged her public image, and her contract with the Florida Citrus Commission was terminated three years later. This, as well as her later divorce from Bob Green, damaged her financially. Bryant never regained her former prominence and filed for bankruptcy twice. Bryant was born on March 25, 1940, in Barnsdall, Oklahoma, the daughter of Lenora A. (Berry) and Warren Bryant.[2] After her parents divorced, her father went into the U.S. Army and her mother went to work as a clerk for Tinker Air Force Base, taking her children to live with their grandparents temporarily.[3] She began singing at the age of 2 at the First Baptist church in Barnsdall, with \"Jesus Loves Me\".[4] She was singing onstage at the age of six, at local fairgrounds in Oklahoma. She sang occasionally on radio and television, and was invited to audition when Arthur Godfrey's talent show came to town. At age 12, she had her television show The Anita Bryant Show, which aired on WKY.[5] Bryant became Miss Oklahoma in 1958, and was second runner-up in the 1959 Miss America pageant (held September 6, 1958) at age 18, right after graduating from Tulsa's Will Rogers High School.[6] She appeared early in her career on the NBC interview program Here's Hollywood and on the same network's The Ford Show, starring Tennessee Ernie Ford.[citation needed] Bryant released several albums on the Carlton and Columbia labels.[citation needed] Her first album, Anita Bryant, which was released in 1959, contained \"Till There Was You\" and songs from other Broadway shows.[citation needed] Her second album, Hear Anita Bryant in Your Home Tonight (1961), contains \"Paper Roses\" and \"Wonderland by Night\", as well as several songs that first appeared in her singles.[citation needed] Her third album, In My Little Corner of the World, also in 1961, contains the title song and other songs that have to do with places around the world, including \"Canadian Sunset\" and \"I Love Paris\".[citation needed] Bryant's compilation album, Greatest Hits (1963), contains both her original Carlton hits (because Columbia purchased all the masters from Carlton) plus sides from her Columbia recordings, including \"Paper Roses\" and \"Step by Step, Little by Little\".[citation needed] In 1964, she released The World of Lonely People, containing, in addition to the title song, \"Welcome, Welcome Home\" and a new rendition of \"Little Things Mean a Lot\", arranged by Frank Hunter. Bryant also released several albums of religious music.[citation needed] Bryant had a moderate pop hit with the song \"Till There Was You\" (1959, US No. 30), from the Broadway production The Music Man. She also had three hits that reached the Top 20 in the U.S.: \"Paper Roses\" (1960, US No. 5, and covered by Marie Osmond 13 years later), \"In My Little Corner of the World\" (1960, US No. 10), and \"Wonderland by Night\" (1961, US No. 18), originally a hit for Bert Kaempfert. \"Paper Roses\", \"In My Little Corner of the World\", and \"Till There Was You\", each sold over one million copies, and were awarded a gold disc by the RIAA.[7] From 1961 until 1968, Bryant frequently joined Bob Hope on holiday tours for the United Service Organizations. She again traveled with Hope for televised shows during the Vietnam War.[8][9] Bryant was given the Silver Medallion Award from the National Guard for \"outstanding service by an entertainer\", and the Veterans of Foreign Wars Leadership Gold Medallion.[10] Between 1964 and 1969, Bryant performed at multiple White House functions, including both the Democratic Convention in Chicago and the Miami Republican Convention in 1968.[11] In 1967, with I Believe she moved towards gospel which would also characterize the music of her other albums.[12] In 1969, Bryant became a spokeswoman for the Florida Citrus Commission, and nationally televised commercials featured her singing \"Come to the Florida Sunshine Tree\" and stating the commercials' tagline: \"Breakfast without orange juice is like a day without sunshine.\" (Later, the slogan became, \"It isn't just for breakfast anymore!\") In addition during that time, she appeared in advertisements for Coca-Cola, Kraft Foods, Holiday Inn, and Tupperware. In the 1970s, Bryant was teamed up with the Disney Character \"Orange Bird\", with whom she appeared in several orange juice commercials. She also sang the Orange Bird Song and narrated the Orange Bird record album, with music written by the Sherman Brothers. She also published her cookbook, Bless This Food: The Anita Bryant Family Cookbook, described as \"Much more than a cookbook, this is the story of a family devoted to Christ.\"[11] Bryant sang \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\" during the half-time show of Super Bowl V in 1971, and at the graveside services for President of the United States Lyndon B. Johnson in 1973.[citation needed] Bryant hosted a two-hour television special, The Anita Bryant Spectacular, in March 1980.[13] She recounted her autobiography, appeared in medleys of prerecorded songs, and interviewed Pat Boone. The West Point Glee Club and General William Westmoreland participated.[14] In 1977, Dade County, Florida, passed an ordinance sponsored by Bryant's former friend Ruth Shack that prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.[15] Bryant led a highly publicized campaign to repeal the ordinance, as the leader of a coalition named Save Our Children. The singer was especially concerned about the fact that the ordinance risked authorizing homosexual people to work in Christian schools and become role-models, because her own children were enrolled there.[16] The campaign was based on conservative Christian beliefs regarding the sinfulness of homosexuality and the proposed threat of homosexual recruitment of children and child molestation. Bryant stated:[17] What these people really want, hidden behind obscure legal phrases, is the legal right to propose to our children that theirs is an acceptable alternate way of life. ... I will lead such a crusade to stop it as this country has not seen before. She also perpetuated the idea of the gay community 'recruiting' children through child abuse to become homosexual themselves. When Shack and other leaders refused to vote in opposition to the ordinance as per her request, she pleaded with families directly \"The recruitment of our children is absolutely necessary for the survival and growth of homosexuality‚Ä¶ for since homosexuals cannot reproduce, they must recruit, must freshen their ranks.\"[11] The campaign marked the beginning of an organized opposition to gay rights that spread across the nation.[18] Jerry Falwell went to Miami to help Bryant. She made the following statements during the campaign: \"As a mother, I know that homosexuals cannot biologically reproduce children; therefore, they must recruit our children\" and \"If gays are granted rights, next we'll have to give rights to prostitutes and to people who sleep with St. Bernards and to nail biters.\"[17] She also said, \"All America and all the world will hear what the people have said, and with God's continued help we will prevail in our fight to repeal similar laws throughout the nation.\"[15][19][20][21] The name of the campaign had to be changed to \"Protect America's Children\" because of legal action by the Save the Children foundation.[22][11] On June 7, 1977, Bryant's campaign led to a repeal of the anti-discrimination ordinance by a margin of 69 to 31 percent. However, the success of Bryant's campaign galvanized her opponents, and the gay community retaliated against her by forming the Coalition for Human Rights and the Miami Victory Campaign, who organized a boycott of orange juice.[17][11] Gay bars all over North America stopped serving screwdrivers[23] and replaced them with the \"Anita Bryant Cocktail\", which was made with vodka and apple juice.[24] Additionally, merchandise such as buttons, bumper stickers, and T-shirts with slogans like \"A day without human rights is like a day without sunshine\" were sold to push the anti-discrimination movement further.[11] Sales and proceeds went to gay rights activists to help fund their fight against Bryant and her campaign.[24] In 1977, Florida legislators approved a measure prohibiting gay adoption.[17] The ban was overturned more than 30 years later when, on November 25, 2008, Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Cindy S. Lederman declared it unconstitutional.[25] On October 14, 1977, during a televised appearance in Des Moines, Iowa, she repeatedly said she \"loves homosexuals, but hates their sin.\"[26] During this appearance, Bryant became one of the first people to be publicly \"pied\" as part of a political protest. She had a pie thrown at her by Thom L. Higgins (1950‚Äì1994).[27][28] Bryant quipped \"At least it's a fruit pie,\"[29] making a pun on the derogatory slur of \"fruit\" for a gay man. While covered in pie after the assault, she began to pray to God to forgive the activist \"for his deviant lifestyle\" before bursting into tears as the cameras continued rolling. Bryant's husband said that he would not retaliate, but followed the protesters outside and threw a pie at them.[24] By this time, gay activists ensured that the boycott on Florida orange juice had become more prominent and it was supported by many celebrities, including Jane Fonda[24][page needed], Paul Williams,[30] and Vincent Price (he joked in a television interview that Oscar Wilde's A Woman of No Importance referred to her).[31] Johnny Carson also made Bryant a regular target of ridicule in his nightly monologues.[32] In 1978, Bryant and Bob Green told the story of their campaign in the book At Any Cost.[17] The gay community continued to regard Bryant's name as synonymous with bigotry and homophobia.[24][33] But at the same time, her name became a call to action for gay rights activists, and motivated many to picket her events, host anti-Bryant protests across the country, and increase attendance in and frequency of pride marches.[11] Bryant led several more campaigns around the country to repeal local anti-discrimination ordinances, including campaigns in St. Paul, Minnesota; Wichita, Kansas; and Eugene, Oregon. In 1978, her success led to the Briggs Initiative in California, which would have made pro-gay statements regarding homosexual people or homosexuality by any public school employee cause for dismissal.[17] Grassroots liberal organizations, chiefly in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area, organized to defeat the initiative. Days before the election, the California Democratic Party opposed the proposed legislation. President Jimmy Carter, Governor Jerry Brown, former president Gerald Ford, and former governor Ronald Reagan‚Äîthen planning a run for the presidency‚Äîall voiced opposition to the initiative, and it ultimately suffered a massive defeat at the polls.[24] In 1998, the Miami-Dade County Commission reinstated the ordinance protecting individuals from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, by a narrow 7‚Äì6 vote. In 2002, a ballot initiative to repeal the 1998 law, called Amendment 14, was voted down by 56 percent of the voters.[24] The Florida statute forbidding gay adoption was upheld in 2004 by a federal appellate court against a constitutional challenge but was overturned by a Miami-Dade circuit court in November 2008.[25] The fallout from Bryant's political activism hurt her business and entertainment career.[34] In February 1977, the Singer Corporation rescinded an offer to sponsor an upcoming weekly variety show because of the \"extensive national publicity arising from [Bryant's] controversial political activities.\"[35] In 1978, while a member of a Baptist church, she ran for vice president of the Southern Baptist Convention, but lost. Several leaders disagreed with how she rejected civil rights for gay people.[36] Bryant's marriage to Bob Green also failed at that time, and in 1980 she divorced him, citing emotional abuse and latent suicidal thoughts.[37] Green refused to accept this, saying that his fundamentalist religious beliefs did not recognize civil divorce and that she was still his wife \"in God's eyes\".[38] Some Christian fundamentalist audiences and venues shunned Bryant after her divorce. Because she was no longer invited to appear at their events, she lost a major source of income. The Florida Citrus Commission also allowed her contract to lapse after the divorce, stating that Bryant had \"worn out\" as a spokesperson.[39][40] Bryant rapidly became an object of ridicule, as her image shifted from being a model Christian spokeswoman to that of a self-righteous bigot. The decline of her reputation was aided by Tonight Show host Johnny Carson, and other talk-show hosts and comedians, as they mocked her and her actions to the greater public. This led to many of her endorsements being cancelled and sponsors to drop her from their labels as she seemed to be a liability to them.[11] With three of her four children, she moved from Miami to Selma, Alabama, and later to Atlanta, Georgia.[37] In a 1980 Ladies' Home Journal article she said, \"The church needs to wake up and find some way to cope with divorce and women's problems.\" She also expressed some sympathy for feminist aspirations, given her own experiences of emotional abuse within her previous marriage. Bryant also commented on her anti-gay views and said, \"I'm more inclined to say live and let live, just don't flaunt it or try to legalize it.\"[41] In a 2012 interview, her son Robert Green, Jr. said \"she would be putting a lot more energy into fighting gay rights if she still felt as strongly.\"[42] Bryant appeared in Michael Moore's 1989 documentary film Roger & Me, in which she is interviewed and travels to Flint, Michigan, as part of the effort to revitalize its devastated local economy.[43] Bryant married her second husband, Charlie Hobson Dry, in 1990.[37] The couple tried to reestablish her music career in a series of small venues, including Branson, Missouri, and Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, where they opened Anita Bryant's Music Mansion. The establishment combined Bryant's performances of her successful songs from early in her career with a \"lengthy segment in which she preached her Christian beliefs\". The venture was not successful and the Music Mansion, which had missed meeting payrolls at times, filed for bankruptcy in 2001 with Bryant and Dry leaving behind a series of unpaid employees and creditors.[34] Bryant also spent part of the 1990s in Branson, Missouri, where the state and federal governments both filed liens claiming more than $116,000 in unpaid taxes. Bryant and Dry had also filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Arkansas in 1997 after piling up bills from a failed Anita Bryant show in Eureka Springs; among the debts were more than $172,000 (equivalent to about $326,000 in 2023) in unpaid state and federal taxes.[34] In 1996, Bryant said she was happy to be out of show business.[44] In 2005, Bryant returned to Barnsdall to attend the town's 100th anniversary celebration and to have a street renamed in her honor. In 2006, she founded Anita Bryant Ministries International in Oklahoma City.[5] In 1960, Bryant married Bob Green (1931‚Äì2012), a Miami disc jockey, with whom she eventually raised four children: Robert Jr. (Bobby), Gloria, and twins Billy and Barbara. She divorced him in 1980, attracting allegations of hypocrisy from the Christian right, who cited the indissolubility of Christian marriage.[34][45][46] Bryant married her second husband, Charlie Hobson Dry, in 1990. She was a member of Victory Church in Warr Acres, Oklahoma, a nondenominational evangelical church.[4] They remained married until his death in April 2024, eight months before Bryant's death.[47] In 2021, Bryant's granddaughter, Sarah Green, came out publicly on an episode of Slate's One Year podcast series by announcing her pending marriage to a woman, although she was having difficulty deciding whether she should invite her grandmother to the ceremony.[48][49] Bryant died from cancer at her home in Edmond, Oklahoma, on December 16, 2024.[50][51] Bryant's name has frequently been invoked as a prototypical example of opposition to LGBT rights. When Elton John was criticized for touring Russia in 1979, he responded: \"I wouldn't say I won't tour in America because I can't stand Anita Bryant\".[52] In his song \"Ma√±ana\", Jimmy Buffett sings \"I hope Anita Bryant never ever does one of my songs\".[53] In 1978, David Allan Coe recorded the song \"Fuck Aneta Briant\" [sic] on his album Nothing Sacred.[54][55] California punk rock band Dead Kennedys referenced Bryant in their song \"Moral Majority\" from their 1981 EP In God We Trust, Inc.[56] In 1977, the Dutch levenslied singer Zangeres Zonder Naam wrote the protest song \"Luister Anita\" (\"Listen Up, Anita\") on the occasion of the protest night \"Miami Nightmare\", organized in the Amsterdam Concertgebouw. The nightly concert was intended to raise funds for an advertisement in Time, in which the Dutch nation was to call on the American people to protect the rights of minorities. In the song, Zangeres Zonder Naam compared Anita Bryant to Hitler and called on gays to fight for their rights. The song became an integral part of her repertoire and cemented her status as a cult figure among Dutch gays.[57] Steve Gerber, in his Howard the Duck for Marvel Comics, made an organization called the Sinister S.O.O.F.I. (Save Our Offspring from Indecency) who were led by Anita Bryant. Although it was not explicitly stated, even The New York Times called the implication \"transparent\".[58] Bryant was regularly lampooned on Saturday Night Live, sometimes with her politics as the target,[59][60] sometimes her reputation as a popular, traditional entertainer known for her commercials as the target,[61] and sometimes targeting a combination of the two.[62] Her name was also a frequent punchline on The Gong Show, such as the time host/producer Chuck Barris joked that Bryant was releasing a new Christmas album called Gay Tidings. Some references were less overtly political, but equally critical. In the film Airplane!, Leslie Nielsen's character, upon seeing a large number of passengers become violently ill, vomit, and have uncontrollable flatulence, remarked: \"I haven't seen anything like this since the Anita Bryant concert.\"[63][64] Other television shows that targeted her were Soap,[65] Designing Women,[66] and The Golden Girls.[67][68] She was also the target of mockery in the RiffTrax short Drugs Are Like That.[69] Armistead Maupin, in his 1980 novel More Tales of the City, used Anita Bryant's \"Save Our Children\" campaign to prompt a principal character to come out of the closet.[70] In the cold open of a 2005 episode of Will and Grace, 'Dance Cards and Greeting Cards', Karen Walker refers to Bryant as her former arch nemesis and references Bryant's former position as the spokesman for the Florida Citrus Commission: \"Well, I said the same thing to him I said to Anita: 'Squeeze your own oranges!'\".[71] Bryant appears in archive footage as a principal antagonist in the 2008 American biographical film Milk, about the life of gay rights activist and politician Harvey Milk. She was also portrayed as the principal antagonist in the 2011 play, Anita Bryant Died for Your Sins.[72] In May 2013, producers announced plans for a biographical HBO film based on Bryant's life to star Uma Thurman, with a script from gay screenwriter Chad Hodge.[73][74][75] Long languishing in development, as of 2019, Ashley Judd and Neil Patrick Harris have been attached to the project.[76] Bryant is a frequently portrayed character at drag shows across the United States.[77][78] Bryant was lampooned in the 2016 play Anita Bryant's Playboy Interview, based on her 1978 magazine piece.[79] She is also the subject of The Loneliest Girl in the World, a musical that premiered at Diversionary Theatre in San Diego in mid-2018.[80][81] Archive footage of Bryant appears in The Gospel of Eureka, a 2018 documentary about the lives of LGBT individuals and evangelical Christians in Eureka Springs, Arkansas.[82] Mark D. Jordan has written: \"Many of her public statements, including her books, were ghostwritten by others, and there is internal reason to conclude that the most political books were pasted together by several hands from various sources.\"[83]",

                "title": "Anita Bryant Dead: Pop Singer Turned Anti-Gay Rights Crusader Was 84",
                "content": "By Chris Willman Senior Music Writer and Chief Music Critic Anita Bryant, a former beauty queen and pop singer of the 1960s whose career led her to become a spokesperson for Florida oranges in the early ‚Äô70s and an evangelical crusader against gay rights later in that decade, died Dec. 16 at age 84, her family announced Thursday. The family‚Äôs obituary for Anita Bryant Day, as she was known outside the public sphere, was published in her hometown newspaper, the Oklahoman, and said the singer-activist died at home last month in Edmond, Oklahoma, surrounded by family and friends. During her heyday as a public figure, Bryant was one of the most polarizing celebrities in America, vilified by much of the show business community for campaigning against what she viewed as a gay takeover of American culture, while being embraced as a hero by many religious conservatives. Popular on Variety Related Stories VIP+ ‚ÄúUnfollow Vexbolts‚Äù: How Self-Sabotage Became the Creator Economy‚Äôs First Genius Tactic of 2025 Melissa Rivers Saved Joan Rivers' Only Emmy Award Before House Burned Down in L.A. Fires; Melissa Says Her Entire Town Is 'Wiped Off the Map' Prior to her taking those stands, she was best known for her appearances in commercials for Florida oranges that introduced the catchphrase ‚ÄúBreakfast without orange juice is like a day without sunshine‚Äù ‚Äî and many parodies of that statement ‚Äî into the popular lexicon. Those advertisements eclipsed her long-dormant career as a pop singer, even as she made a move into recording gospel music after easy-listening sounds fell out of fashion in the rock era. Bryant‚Äôs notable public appearances in her less controversial years included singing at both the Democratic and Republican conventions in 1968, being a staple of Bob Hope‚Äôs holiday tours for overseas troops for seven straight years, singing ‚ÄúThe Battle Hymn of the Republic‚Äù at the 1971 Super Bowl, and providing that some anthem as a musical eulogy for President Lyndon Johnson at his 1973 funeral, after singing for him on several occasions. In 1977, Bryant began fronting a ‚ÄúSave Our Children‚Äù campaign aimed at repealing an ordinance in Miami-Dade County that prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The crusade was successful in getting the ordinance repealed that year by a popular vote. (It was not restored until 1998.) For the next three years, her activism against such regulations made her a poster girl for the religious right and the foremost public archenemy of the gay community and social liberals. Her statement that she ‚Äúloves homosexuals, but hates their sin‚Äù became a sort of mantra for evangelicals ‚Äî and a much-mocked meme among what would later be known as the LGBTQ community ‚Äî for decades to come. In 1978, her views were further amplified by the national media when she was the subject of the monthly ‚ÄúPlayboy Interview.‚Äù The magazine began by recapping the sudden turnaround in her image: ‚ÄúFor her first 36 years, Anita Bryant was the stereotypic embodiment of the American dream; hers was a rags-to-riches saga in the best Horatio Alger tradition. ‚Ä¶ Her life was comfortable and distinctly uncontroversial. Last year, all that suddenly and dramatically changed; her halcyon routine perished in the flames of political warfare. When the Metropolitan Dade County Commission passed an ordinance that would, in effect, mandate that qualified homosexuals be hired as teachers in private and parochial schools, Bryant stepped forward to spearhead a drive to repeal it. The ensuing campaign was drawn along classic good-versus-evil lines. Bryant recruited a slew of religious leaders and conservative politicos under the banner of her ad hoc organization, Save Our Children. Her pitch was simple: Homosexuality is a sin, and if homosexuals were given carte blanche to glamorize their ‚Äòdeviate lifestyle‚Äô in Miami-area classrooms, the American family would be destroyed and the American way of life would disappear. ‚Ä¶ Bryant had become a fixture on the American political scene.‚Äù In the Playboy interview, Bryant said that she had not thought much about homosexuality prior to the Florida legislation that prompted her ire. ‚ÄúI got involved only because they were asking for special privileges that violated the state law of Florida, not to mention God‚Äôs law. ‚Ä¶ God says the wages of sin are death, and one little sin brings on another. The homosexual act is just the beginning of the depravity. It then leads to‚Äìwhat‚Äôs the word?‚Äìsadomasochism. It just gets worse as it goes on. You go further and further down the drain and it just becomes so perverted and you get into alcohol and drugs and it‚Äôs so rotten that many homosexuals end up committing suicide. The worst thing is that these days, so many married men with children who don‚Äôt have a happy marriage are going into the homosexual bars for satisfaction‚Äìif they‚Äôre not careful, they‚Äôre going to get caught up in it totally.‚Äù Her activism extended well beyond Florida as her fame in that arena grew, and she advocated for California‚Äôs infamous Briggs Initiative, which looked to ban public school employees from making pro-gay statements, at the cost of their employment. Even former California governor Ronald Reagan joined liberals in opposing the initiative, and once it went down to a massive defeat among voters, Bryant‚Äôs influence waned. Her activism led to the end of any substantial career Bryant had beyond the conservative Christian community. With Bryant becoming a punchline for Johnny Carson, and counteractivists boycotting oranges and adopting catchphrases like ‚ÄúA day without human rights is like a day without sunshine,‚Äù the Florida Citrus Commission declined to renew her contract as its brand ambassador in 1980, after an 11-year run that had included co-hosting the Orange Bowl Parade telecast for nine years. Other endorsement deals also dried up, although she had a sort of last hurrah with a two-hour ‚ÄúAnita Bryant Spectacular‚Äù patriotic special in 1980, with Bob Hope and Pat Boone costarring. Bryant divorced her husband, Bob Green, also in 1980, despite his publicly contesting the split on religious grounds. Her support in the evangelical community dropped as a result, with some of her former supporters believing that her initiating a divorce was sinful. After a decade of being single, she married her second husband, Charlie Hobson Dry, a childhood sweetheart, in 1990. One of Bryant‚Äôs most curious public appearances came in 1989 when she was interviewed by Roger Moore for his ‚ÄúRoger & Me‚Äù documentary. ‚ÄúCheer up, Flint, Michigan,‚Äù Bryant was seen as advising the economically depressed city, leading to further derision. Bryant represented Oklahoma in the Miss America pageant in 1958, becoming second-runner-up. Many people believed she won the contest, because she already had some notoriety in television and music at that point. ‚ÄúI already had a recording contract when I did Miss America, so people knew me,‚Äù she said in a 2008 interview. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really funny because people still tell me they remember when I won Miss America.‚Äù Bryant‚Äôs biggest break came when one of Arthur Godfrey‚Äôs talent scouts discovered her and put her on his variety show when she was 16, with a series of appearances there leading to her record deal. She soon was appearing on other shows, from Ed Sullivan‚Äôs to ‚ÄúAmerican Bandstand.‚Äù Commercials for Kraft, Coca-Cola and Holiday Inn followed. Her biggest charting song was ‚ÄúPaper Roses,‚Äù which reached No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1960. It was followed by one other top 10 song, ‚ÄúMy Little Corner of the World.‚Äù She registered 14 singles on the chart between 1959 and 1964, recording for the Carlton and Columbia labels. As rock sounds took over, she was seen more often on TV variety shows than on pop radio. Bryant did not have any breakout albums, although a holiday album that became something of an easy listening perennial, ‚ÄúDo You Hear What I Hear?: Christmas With Anita Bryant,‚Äù peaked at No. 25 in 1967. In 1970, Bryan released her first album with Word, the prominent Christian label of the day, and released primarily religious material thereafter. She also wrote a series of books with and without her then-husband Bob for Fleming H. Revell, a Christian publisher, that were popular in religious bookstores throughout the ‚Äô70s. Her last album was released in 1985. She was nominated for three Grammys in the late ‚Äô60s and early ‚Äô70s, all for religious material, two in the since-renamed ‚Äúbest sacred performance‚Äù category and one for best inspirational performance. During her glory days as one of TV‚Äôs most sought-after advertising personalities, Bryan‚Äôs campaign for Florida oranges had such a positive effect, she was credited with orange juice sales climbing from 382 million gallons to 800 million-plus gallons during her 1969-80 tenure as pitchwoman. In the subsequent years when the gay rights controversies made her anathema to most mainstream television programmers and advertisers, she continued to enjoy name value among some older consumers who came to see her first in Branson, Missouri, where she and her second husband opened a theater in the early ‚Äô90s, and then Nashville, where she moved in 1998 to put on a live variety extravaganza. Bryant moved back to Oklahoma in 2002 to care for her ill mother, deciding to remain in the state thereafter because of its friendliness to her traditional religious values. Well out of the limelight, she worked on writing inspirational books and founding Anita Bryant Ministries International. Bryant was preceded in death by her husband, Charlie, and is survived by four children, two stepdaughters, and seven grandchildren and their spouses.

By Anita Gates Anita Bryant, the singer and former beauty queen who had a robust and flourishing music career, including hit songs like ‚ÄúPaper Roses,‚Äù in the 1960s and ‚Äô70s, but whose opposition to gay rights ‚Äî she called homosexuality ‚Äúan abomination‚Äù ‚Äî virtually destroyed her career, died on Dec. 16. She was 84. The death, at her home in Edmond, Okla., was caused by cancer, her son William Green said. The family placed an obituary in The Oklahoman, a newspaper in Oklahoma City, on Thursday. Ms. Bryant was just 18 when she won the Miss Oklahoma beauty title and was named second runner-up in the Miss America pageant. She promptly turned that success into a lucrative show business career. For almost two decades, she had a smooth run ‚Äî entertaining troops on U.S.O. tours with Bob Hope, performing during Billy Graham‚Äôs evangelical tours and co-hosting nationally televised parades. She sang the national anthem at the Super Bowl and ‚ÄúBattle Hymn of the Republic‚Äù at President Lyndon B. Johnson‚Äôs graveside. Most memorably, she represented the Florida Citrus Commission in a long campaign of television commercials, in which she sang ‚ÄúCome to the Florida Sunshine Tree‚Äù and offered the tagline: ‚ÄúBreakfast without orange juice is like a day without sunshine.‚Äù Wearing gingham, ruffles or both, she sauntered down country lanes (juice pitcher in hand), talked to cartoon birds and beamed with joy about the wonders of vitamin C.

                "content": "This Day In History: October 14 Changing the day will navigate the page to that given day in history. You can navigate days by using left and right arrows 1977 On October 14, 1977, while speaking at an event in Iowa to promote her campaign to roll back anti-discrimination laws protecting LGBTQ people, Anita Bryant is hit in the face with a pie. Bryant was an American household name before she made headlines for her anti-gay political activism. She was the winner of Miss Tulsa in 1957, a runner-up for Miss America in 1960, and the spokesperson for Florida Orange Juice. She was also a pop singer, and performed at the halftime show of Super Bowl V in 1971. She gained national notoriety as a political campaigner in 1977 when she took a stand against a local ordinance in Dade County, Florida, where she lived with her husband and children. The ordinance forbade discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in housing and employment. Bryant's organized opposition succeeded in repealing those protections. Bryant appealed to Christian values and motherhood in her anti-gay campaign, which she called \"Save our Children.\" She argued that the gay rights movement threatened to undermine Christian family values, while stoking fears that gay adults would abuse or \"recruit\" children. She considered homosexuality to be \"deviant\" and \"an abomination of God,\" and therefore dangerous and unworthy of anti-discrimination protections. After Bryant successfully repealed the ordinance in Dade County, she went on a tour to promote similar campaigns across the country. At a stop in Des Moines, Iowa, gay activist Tom Higgins pied Bryant in the face. Bryant quipped, \"at least it's a fruit pie,\" before praying for Higgins's soul and breaking into tears. Higgins was not alone in protesting Bryant's speaking tour. Backlash against her crusade inspired large protests in cities like Houston, and galvanized the gay rights movement. Gay bars began boycotting orange juice; instead of screwdrivers, they served \"Anita Bryants,\" urging patrons to \"squeeze a fruit for Anita.\" At the same time, she was voted Good Housekeeping magazine's most admired woman for three years running. By 1980, Bryant lost her job as spokeswoman for Florida orange juice, her singing career stalled and she divorced her husband. The legacy of her brief political career lives on in continued attempts to block or roll back civil rights for LBGTQ Americans. In Bryant's home state of Florida, in particular, recent so-called \"Don't Say Gay\" legislation and pushes for \"parental rights\" recall Bryant's rhetoric in the 1970s.

                "title": "Inside Carson Beck's transfer: The quiet tension behind his Georgia departure and what may come next - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Quarterback Carson Beck has entered the transfer portal after previously declaring for the NFL Draft, sources confirmed to CBS Sports and 247Sports. While Beck's decision wasn't entirely a surprise as he had yet to sign a standard representation agreement with an NFL agent, leaving the door open to return to college, the timing and manner in which it unfolded caught Georgia off guard. A member of Beck's camp gave Bulldogs head coach Kirby Smart a heads-up only shortly before the news leaked Thursday afternoon, sources say, though that is not to say Georgia expected Beck back in Athens. The nature in which Beck's departure played out contributes to further sourness in the breakup. Sources say Georgia, at large, had already been miffed with Beck being away from the team during much of College Football Playoff preparation for the Sugar Bowl as Beck sought opinions from doctors in California and Texas. Beck was on the sideline for the Sugar Bowl, where the Bulldogs' season ended in a 23-10 loss to Notre Dame. Beck arrived in New Orleans a day later than his teammates and skipped the team's media day. Some within the program that week seemed ready to move on from Beck, whose personality and headline-grabbing relationship with Miami basketball star and TikTok sensation Hanna Cavinder had become a distraction and a source of frustration for some teammates, sources said, though many of his teammates remained supportive of him as he dealt with a season-ending surgery. On the morning of the team's first full day in New Orleans, Beck phoned first-time starter Gunner Stockton, his replacement, to voice support and provide guidance heading into the Bulldogs' playoff game. Beck arrived in New Orleans later that day. Beck's move to the portal allows him to explore his options, including a potential return to college football in 2025. While the NFL Draft remains a viable path, entering the portal and returning to college gives Beck time to recover from UCL surgery and evaluate opportunities, both on the field and through lucrative NIL deals, while improving his draft stock for the 2026 NFL Draft. \"Great decision,\" said one NFL director of college scouting. \"He should help himself.\" Even before Beck's UCL injury, he was not expected to factor into Round 1 consideration for the 2025 NFL Draft. One NFL scout who covers the Southeast believed Beck would have been a Day 3 pick. Beck's season was essentially a tale of three different acts, mired by a 12-interception spree between his fourth and 10th games. In Georgia's first three games, Beck tossed seven scores to no interceptions and in his final four games, Beck added 11 more scores, also with no interceptions. Sources indicate Beck could command as much as $3 million in revenue-share agreements, a figure rivaling a second-round NFL rookie salary. Beck would also be expected to earn more from collective funds and marketing deals. Notably, Beck entered the transfer portal with a \"do not contact\" tag, a designation that sometimes signals a player already has a destination in mind upon his entry into the transfer market. Miami begins as the frontrunner for Beck's services and has aimed its eye on Beck, among other quarterbacks, in recent weeks a potential transfer target. The Hurricanes have a need for an experienced quarterback and potential to offer a competitive NIL package. The Hurricanes have actively pursued transfer quarterbacks throughout the cycle, a process that's picked up steam in recent weeks since Emory Williams' underwhelming Pop-Tart Bowl performance (5-for-14, 26 yards, one interception) in relief of Cam Ward in the second half. Ward enrolled at Miami last year after receiving feedback from the NFL that he was not likely to be a first-round pick in the 2024 draft; he leaves Coral Gables as the likely first overall pick in the upcoming 2025 draft. There's a history of Miami paying whatever it takes to land a transfer quarterback, and there's clear urgency on the Hurricanes' side to get this done with few other options available. Cavinder resides in Miami as a member of Miami's women's basketball team. As Beck explores his options, two other schools popped up Thursday afternoon. Contact was made by Texas Tech officials and Beck's camp, but sources in Lubbock have largely shut down that idea to this point. Another school that may be in the mix is Ohio State. While the Buckeyes have been steadfast behind the scenes that underclassmen like Julian Sayin are likely to take the reins, an established veteran makes some sense as the Buckeyes prepare to undergo significant roster turnover following their playoff run. As for Beck's recovery, his family surveyed a variety of doctors before settling on orthopedic surgeon Dr. Neal ElAttrache, who performed the surgery to repair New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers' torn Achilles in September 2023. Rodgers returned to limited practice activities after only 11 weeks, an advanced return that shocked experts. UCL surgeries typically require four months of recovery before an athlete can return to throwing activities. Many athletes need nine months to a year of rehabilitation before returning to competition. Such a recovery timeline would bump Beck's return against the start of the 2025 season, and would obviously restrict him from participating in spring practices. There's always the possibility Beck decides to remain in the NFL Draft with a Jan. 15 deadline to decide, but a return to college allows Beck to repair his draft stock -- and it doesn't hurt that Beck would likely make more money next year by staying in college than he otherwise would in the NFL, where late second-round picks and early third-round picks make only around $1 million a year. Georgia, for its part, already was planning for life without Beck. Georgia had explored a few veteran options in the transfer portal, but the Bulldogs now appear confident in Gunner Stockton as their future QB1 after his strong performance against Notre Dame in the Sugar Bowl. Stockton finished the afternoon 20-for-32 with 234 yards and a touchdown against arguably the best secondary in the country, showing a nice command of UGA's offense. It's possible Georgia explores adding a veteran to the room, especially with the move of third-string quarterback Jaden Rashada to the transfer portal. Rashada's absence leaves the Bulldogs with Stockton (one career start) along with former four-star prospects Ryan Puglisi (2024 class) and Ryan Montgomery (2025 class). Beck recorded 27 career starts over the last two seasons. His 7,912 passing yards and 58 passing touchdowns are sixth-most in Georgia history.

Beck. He still has one season of college eligibility left, but is looking to explore his options and potentially play another year at the collegiate level. Beck's time at Georgia has been marked by a rollercoaster of achievements and challenges. Taking over as the starting quarterback in 2023, Beck led the Bulldogs to an impressive 12-0 regular-season record. However, his performance in 2024 was more inconsistent, with turnovers becoming a notable issue. Last season, he threw for 3,485 yards, 28 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions. An injury in the SEC Championship Game, which required UCL surgery, added another layer of complexity to his draft prospects and his future was already in jeopardy with the Dawgs. Related: After initially deciding to enter the NFL Draft, Carson Beck received feedback suggesting he might be selected anywhere between the first and third rounds. This uncertainty, combined with his injury concerns, prompted Beck to reconsider and explore the transfer portal. This move allows him the opportunity to address any lingering questions about his health and prove himself further in the college football arena. Miami has emerged as a potential landing spot for Beck, given his ties to Jacksonville, Florida, and his relationship with Miami women's basketball player Hanna Cavinder. A final season of eligibility at Miami could offer Beck the chance to regain his form and boost his draft stock. As Beck embarks on this new chapter, the college football community watches closely to see where he will land and how he will perform in his final year of eligibility. His decision could have significant implications for both his career and the teams involved. ¬© Unidad Editorial Informaci√≥n Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved. Follow us",

The ensemble tells a story of the sacrifice all must pay when they choose to enter the lawless and brutal frontier. ‚ÄúWe are very appreciative that Netflix is trusting us to take a big swing with American Primeval,‚Äù director and executive producer Pete Berg (Friday Night Lights, Lone Survivor) told Netflix. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking forward to taking viewers into the most dynamic, intense, and heart-pounding survival tale humanly possible. We are going into the belly of the beast.‚Äù American Primeval is Berg‚Äôs first project under his first-look deal with Netflix and is written by Mark L. Smith (The Midnight Sky, The Revenant, Overlord), with Eric Newman (Griselda, Narcos, The Watcher) serving as showrunner and executive producer. This also marks the second collaboration between Berg, Newman, and Kitsch, who worked together on the limited series Painkiller, which premiered on service in 2023. The cast of American Primeval includes: Right up top! See Kitsch, Gilpin, and more as they face a new frontier where the only goal is survival. Yes, check out Kitsch, Gilpin, Whigham, and more in action above. Out of 130 shooting days on American Primeval, only two(!) were filmed indoors. The rest were all shot on location in New Mexico, at places including Pueblo de Cochiti, Santa Clara Pueblo, Bonanza Creek Ranch, Parajito Mountain Ski Area, and Charles R Ranch. In building out the scope of American Primeval, Berg was inspired by his love for the Robert Redford film Jeremiah Johnson. ‚ÄúWhen I saw it as a kid, I felt like I was in it,‚Äù the director says. ‚ÄúI was in the elements ‚Ä¶ just surviving, and I always wanted to do something like that.‚Äù American Primeval was Berg, Newman, and Smith‚Äôs chance to go into the New Mexico mountains and create that kind of immersive experience for viewers. ‚ÄúIf ever there was anything easier said than done, it‚Äôs this,‚Äù says Newman. ‚ÄúI believe all of us will forever be haunted in scripts by the words ‚Äòit snows‚Äô or ‚Äònight, exterior night.‚Äô ‚Äù While filming, the actors were braving the kind of weather their characters would have faced in 1857, trudging through the snow, rain, thunder, and lightning, with rattlesnake cameos a daily occurrence on set. Kitsch wouldn‚Äôt have had it any other way. ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre on hour 15 of shooting, and you‚Äôre freezing, and you‚Äôre beyond exhausted, it all comes into play,‚Äù the actor said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing better than shooting on location. I loved it.‚Äù Because the crew was up in the remote mountains, they all really learned how to survive together as a team. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt have Wi-Fi anywhere we were, we had no cell service,‚Äù says Berg. ‚ÄúSo we were actually interacting with each other and bonding.‚Äù If you recognized the dulcet tones of the folk anthem ‚ÄúThis Land Is Your Land‚Äù in the closing moments of the American Primeval finale, then you would have correctly named that tune. Berg enlisted the Texas band Explosions in the Sky, who he‚Äôd previously worked with on Friday Night Lights and Lone Survivor, to cover the famed Woody Guthrie song. ‚ÄúExplosions has a really unique ability to be both tragic and triumphant at the same time,‚Äù Berg tells Tudum. ‚ÄúAnd in doing so, they‚Äôre going to find levels of emotion and real propulsive drive simultaneously.‚Äù While Berg and Newman knew the show would be violent, they still wanted viewers to be able to find emotional touchstones amidst the bleakness. They also appreciated how, at its core, the song isn‚Äôt a love letter to America, but a song of protest ‚Äî Guthrie wrote the lyrics in response to Irving Berlin‚Äôs ‚ÄúGod Bless America.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a protest song about perceived injustice, hardship, and suffering that Woody [Guthrie] was seeing all throughout America,‚Äù says Berg. ‚ÄúAnd those things certainly felt appropriate to American Primeval.‚Äù Additional songs featured in the series include ‚ÄúBackporch Pick‚Äù by Christian Marie Jean Bernard Seguret and Olivier Noel Andres, ‚ÄúWaltzing in the Moonlight‚Äù by George Doering and Steven Lindsey, and the Latter Day Saints hymn ‚ÄúAdam-ondi-Ahman‚Äù (‚ÄúThis Earth Was Once a Garden Place‚Äù), which you can hear Jacob (DeHaan) sing throughout the show. American Primeval is available to stream on Netflix now.

                "title": "2025 Cotton Bowl, Ohio State vs. Texas: Who has the edge in College Football Playoff semifinal game? - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. There's always a lot on the line when Ohio State and Texas take the field, and Friday evening is no exception. The (8) Buckeyes and (5) Longhorns are set to face off in the Cotton Bowl, with a trip to the College Football Playoff National Championship on the line. This is just the fourth time that Ohio State and Texas will meet on the gridiron, and the first since 2009 when No. 3 Texas earned a 24-21 win against No. 10 Ohio State in the Fiesta Bowl. Naturally, given each team's standing, there's going to be a lot of talent on the field. Ohio State hasn't been shy when touting its name, image and likeness capabilities. The Buckeyes went all in on 2024, ensuring that veteran players stuck around for another year and top transfers -- like former Alabama star Caleb Downs -- joined the fold to supplement any holes. Ohio State has finally played to its full potential in the College Football Playoff, winning its first two games -- including a Rose Bowl victory against top-seeded Oregon -- by a combined score of 83-38. Texas made it to the SEC Championship Game in its first year with the conference and handled its first-round College Football Playoff game against Clemson with ease. But the Longhorns were pushed to two overtimes in a quarterfinal 39-31 win over Arizona State after blowing a 24-8 fourth-quarter lead. There's no denying that Texas and Ohio State boast two of the top rosters in college football, but which one actually has the edge when analyzing specific positions? Ohio State: Will Howard Texas: Quinn Ewers Ewers entered the year as a potential first-round pick, while many questioned whether Howard could live up to the high standard that Ohio State has established at the quarterback position in recent years. While Howard took a while to adjust, he's played some of his best football lately during Ohio State's hot postseason run. Ewers, meanwhile, has been prone to cold streaks, and his inability to deliver the ball downfield on a consistent basis has hampered Texas' big-play upside. Howard also adds an extra dimension to the game with his rushing ability, and his punishing frame makes him a load to tackle if he gets a head of steam. Texas does have the better overall situation, with Arch Manning waiting in the wings, but Howard's hot streak gives a distinct advantage at the starting spot. Edge: Ohio State Ohio State: Quinshon Judkins (RB); TreVeyon Henderson (RB); Jeremiah Smith (WR); Emeka Egbuka (WR) Texas: Quintrevion Wisner (RB); Isaiah Bond (WR); Matthew Golden (WR); Gunnar Helm (TE) Though just a freshman, Smith might be the best player on the field Friday evening. Ohio State has made a point to feed him the ball in the College Football Playoff, and he has rewarded that game plan with 13 catches for 290 yards and four touchdowns. He already has the frame of a third-year college football player and the natural skills to make him a matchup nightmare. Oh, the Buckeyes also have a potential first-round wide receiver in Emeka Egbuka and several other former five stars providing a tremendous depth. The backfield pairing of Judkins and Henderson deserves a special nod, as well. Texas has a solid group of wide receivers and the better tight end in Helm, but there's not a college football program that can come close to matching Ohio State's overall skill talent. Edge: Ohio State Ohio State: Donovan Jackson; Austin Siereveld; Carson Hinzman; Tegra Tshabola; Josh Fryar Texas: Kelvin Banks Jr.; Hayden Conner; Jake Majors; DJ Campbell; Cameron Williams Ohio State's offensive line has acquitted itself well during the College Football Playoff despite a litany of injuries that includes starting center Seth McLaughlin. Left tackle Donovan Jackson has been particularly impressive. Texas' group is about as good as it comes, though. Banks will be one of the first offensive linemen off the board in the 2025 NFL Draft, while Majors is an extremely experienced center with a masterful understanding of Texas' offense and blocking schemes. Factor in a potentially healthy Williams, who returned to practice after missing the Arizona State game, and Texas will have a formidable wall to stack against Ohio State's front. Edge: Texas Ohio State: Jack Sawyer (EDGE); Ty Hamilton (DL); Tyleik Williams (DL); JT Tuimoloau (EDGE); Sonny Styles (LB); Cody Simon (LB) Texas: Barryn Sorrell (DL); Alfred Collins (DL); Vernon Broughton (DL); Trey Moore (EDGE); Anthony Hill Jr. (LB); Liona Lefau (LB) \"Front seven\" is a somewhat antiquated term, given that most teams only utilize some combination of six players around the line of scrimmage, but for this article's purposes it constitutes each team's top edge rushers, defensive linemen and linebackers. Ohio State certainly boasts a couple of standouts. Sawyer has been playing the best football of his career lately, while Tuimoloau has the potential to take over a game. It's hard to match Texas' depth, though. The Longhorns have a staunch interior led by Collins and Broughton. Sorrell and Moore are great rushing options off of the edge, not to mention superstar freshman Colin Simmons, who has game-breaking ability. Hill will be the best linebacker on the field, with the versatility to get after the passer and play in space. This is a very close call, but players like Hill give Texas a slight edge. Edge: Texas Ohio State: Denzel Burke (CB); Davison Igbinosun (CB); Jordan Hancock (NB); Caleb Downs (S); Lathan Ransom (S) Texas: Jahdae Barron (CB); Malik Muhammad (CB); Jaylon Guilbeau (NB); Michael Taaffe (S); Andrew Mukuba (S) Barron is tied for fourth nationally with five interceptions. He won the 2024 Thorpe Award as the top defensive back in college football and was also a first-team CBS Sports All-American selection while anchoring Texas' secondary. He's surrounded by a ton of veteran talent, including former walk-on Taaffe and Clemson transfer Mukuba. Ohio State has the overall better situation. Both Burke and Igbinosun are future NFL talents -- though the latter needs to cut down on penalties -- while Downs is arguably the top safety in the nation. Ransom has been great for the Buckeyes, as well, and isn't afraid to make plays closer to the line of scrimmage. Edge: Ohio State Ohio State: Ryan Day Texas: Steve Sarkisian Day catches a lot of flak for a coach that's never won fewer than 10 games in a full 12-game season. Sure, his recent inability to beat Michigan -- and, thus, capture the Big Ten title -- is a reasonable cause for some consternation, but Day's Buckeyes are a mainstay in the national conversation. With the way he recruits, they aren't going anywhere soon. Sarkisian has steadily built Texas back into a contender, with incremental improvements every year and a Big 12 championship already under his belt, but he hasn't hit the sustained level that Day has maintained yet. Both are, inarguably, top-five coaches. Day has just been slightly more consistent with a larger body of recent work. Edge: Ohio State ¬© 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "content": "Den of Thieves 2: Pantera (billed as Den of Thieves: Pantera) is an American action crime drama film written and directed by Christian Gudegast. It is a direct sequel to the 2018 film Den of Thieves and stars Gerard Butler, O'Shea Jackson Jr. and Meadow Williams, reprising their roles from the first film. The film is scheduled to be released in the United States on January 10, 2025, by Lionsgate. Immediately following the events of Den of Thieves, sheriff \"Big Nick\" O'Brien is tracking down Donnie Wilson, who escaped to Europe and is planning another heist. In an interview with Screen Rant, Gudegast said it is based on the 2003 Antwerp diamond heist.[3][4] After the release of Den of Thieves in 2018, development of a sequel was in the works with plans for Christian Gudegast to return as director and writer, as well as for Gerard Butler and O'Shea Jackson Jr. to return and reprise their roles.[5] The film was originally slated to begin filming in 2022.[9][10] Principal photography took place from April to July 2023 in the United Kingdom and the Canary Islands.[7][6] The production transformed several aspects of the main streets in Santa Cruz de Tenerife for the shoot, such as building up a police station and jewelry store and setting up a local bar to appear French.[11] Originally set to be distributed by STX Entertainment, as with the first film, Briarcliff Entertainment purchased the film for distribution in the United States in May 2023 with Sierra/Affinity handling international sales of the film with a wide theatrical release being planned in the United States for late 2024.[12] However, in May 2024, Lionsgate was announced to have distribution rights as part of their acquisition of financiers Entertainment One (later rebranded to Lionsgate Canada) from Hasbro in December 2023, with the film scheduled to be released in the United States on January 10, 2025.[13] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 72% of 18 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.10/10. In the United States and Canada, Den of Thieves 2: Pantera will be released alongside Better Man, and is projected to gross $11‚Äì13 million from 3,000 theaters in its opening weekend.[2]",

                "content": "By Pete Hammond Awards Columnist/Chief Film Critic In 2018, Den Of Thieves delivered the goods (as a kind of junior version of Michael Mann‚Äôs classic Heat, which matched De Niro and Pacino) and was a ballsy attempt to rob the unrobbable Los Angeles Federal Reserve. It did modest but respectable business globally considering its limited ambitions, and that apparently was just enough to justify a sequel. In Den Of Thieves 2: Pantera, Gerard Butler, O‚ÄôShea Jackson Jr. and company head to Europe for another brazen robbery, this time at the top-security World Diamond Center in Nice, where the cop and the crook join forces to penetrate a thief-proof vault full of valuable deposit boxes with millions of dollars of jewels including an uber-desirable pink diamond stolen from the Mafia who wants it back. It‚Äôs complicated. Related Stories News Gerard Butler Says Filming 'Den Of Thieves 2: Pantera' Was \"A Nightmare\": \"I Made This Movie With A Freshly Torn ACL\" News 2024 U.S. Box Office Finals At $8.7 Billion: How The Studios Stand Ditching the L.A. locations of the first (actually doubled by Atlanta), this turns into a lush European and more international adventure that picks up where the first film left off, when the duplicitous Donnie (Jackson) has outsmarted cop Nick (Butler) during the Federal Reserve robbery, and now a defeated Nick just wants revenge and the money he swears Donnie has. Donnie has headed off to Brussels for a new scheme with a new den of thieves from the Balkans known as the Panthers, teaming with crafty Jovanna (Evin Ahmad) and her cohorts Dragon (Orli Shuka) and Slavko (Salvatore Esposito) on a new heist for a treasure trove of jewels. Watch on Deadline The film opens with a hijacking of a Brussels flight loaded with diamonds before switching gears to Nice, where Donnie sets up shop posing as a businessman and gaining access to office space that will give them security clearance thanks to the connections of Chavra Falcon (Nazmiya Oral), who is looking for some quick cash of her own. Fencing a stunning pink diamond, they are in the money, but have bigger plans than that. Suspecting Donnie might be involved in the Brussels job, Nick makes his way to France where he joins up with French police chief Hugo Kaman (Yasen Zates Atour) in an effort to see their surveillance footage with the idea it would identify Donnie‚Äôs whereabouts, something he doesn‚Äôt disclose to the chief when he does indeed spot Donnie. In no time Nick breaks into a mortified Donnie‚Äôs living quarters and confronts him, but surprisingly offers instead to join with him (for a price) and the Panthers to pull off the ultimate heist, a dangerous operation full of peril and nicely executed by returning writer-director Christian Gudegast. This is where the gray area between cop and thief is drawn, and Gudegast has shed some doubt about which side of the law Nick is really on. That guessing game is what helps make this all work despite the familiar trappings of the well-worn genre. The diamond heist sequence is the centerpiece and highlight of the film, but it is by no means the end, and there are literal twist and turns in both the story and in a thrilling car chase across the winding roads in the south of France, a mafia subplot, and a mismatched buddy movie that turns into a cat-and-mouse game sporting several tentacles. The pink diamond so wanted by the Mafia (led by veteran actor Adriano Chiaramida) and fenced by the Panthers will remind you of course of The Pink Panther, but that is where the comparison stops. Den of Thieves 2: Pantera instead turns out to be an ideal action vehicle for the always watchable and rugged Butler, and a worthy enough sequel to an original that wasn‚Äôt all that original to begin with. This one is more effortlessly entertaining thanks to the locations and the stars, especially Butler who is my favorite action star these days. Jackson also is fun to watch, often playing his role, more central here that in the first, with deadpan frustration. The rest of the cast does well, particularly the women, and Atour makes the perfect French cop. Spain‚Äôs Canary Islands doubles for Nice quite well, and the cinematography from Terry Stacey fills the bill. This is what is often called a ‚ÄúJanuary movie,‚Äù but as a start to a new year that has not been great so far, it will take your mind off real-world problems for an overlong 2 1/2 hours (just like the first movie) in a way that makes it worth the price of admission. Producers are Tucker Tooley, Butler, Alan Siegel and Mark Canton.

                "title": "Venezuela - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Venezuela,[c] officially the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,[d] is a country on the northern coast of South America, consisting of a continental landmass and many islands and islets in the Caribbean Sea. It comprises an area of 916,445 km2 (353,841 sq mi), and its population was estimated at 29 million in 2022.[18] The capital and largest urban agglomeration is the city of Caracas. The continental territory is bordered on the north by the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, on the west by Colombia, Brazil on the south, Trinidad and Tobago to the north-east and on the east by Guyana. Venezuela is a presidential republic consisting of 23 states, the Capital District and federal dependencies covering Venezuela's offshore islands. Venezuela is among the most urbanized countries in Latin America;[22][23] the vast majority of Venezuelans live in the cities of the north and in the capital. The territory of Venezuela was colonized by Spain in 1522 amid resistance from Indigenous peoples. In 1811, it became one of the first Spanish-American territories to declare independence from the Spanish and to form part of the first federal Republic of Colombia (Gran Colombia). It separated as a full sovereign country in 1830. During the 19th century, Venezuela suffered political turmoil and autocracy, remaining dominated by regional military dictators until the mid-20th century. From 1958, the country had a series of democratic governments, as an exception where most of the region was ruled by military dictatorships, and the period was characterized by economic prosperity. Economic shocks in the 1980s and 1990s led to major political crises and widespread social unrest, including the deadly Caracazo riots of 1989, two attempted coups in 1992, and the impeachment of a President for embezzlement of public funds charges in 1993. The collapse in confidence in the existing parties saw the 1998 Venezuelan presidential election, the catalyst for the Bolivarian Revolution, which began with a 1999 Constituent Assembly, where a new Constitution of Venezuela was imposed. The government's populist social welfare policies were bolstered by soaring oil prices,[24] temporarily increasing social spending,[25] and reducing economic inequality and poverty in the early years of the regime.[26] However, poverty began to rapidly increase in the 2010s.[27][28] The 2013 Venezuelan presidential election was widely disputed leading to widespread protest, which triggered another nationwide crisis that continues to this day.[29] Venezuela has experienced democratic backsliding, shifting into an authoritarian state.[3] It ranks low in international measurements of freedom of the press and civil liberties and has high levels of perceived corruption.[30] Venezuela is a developing country and has the world's largest known oil reserves and has been one of the world's leading exporters of oil. Previously, the country was an underdeveloped exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and cocoa, but oil quickly came to dominate exports and government revenues. The excesses and poor policies of the incumbent government led to the collapse of Venezuela's entire economy.[31][32] The country struggles with record hyperinflation,[33][34] shortages of basic goods,[35] unemployment,[36] poverty,[37] disease, high child mortality, malnutrition, environmental issues, severe crime and corruption. These factors have precipitated the Venezuelan refugee crisis in which more than 7.7 million people had fled the country by June 2024.[38][39] By 2017, Venezuela was declared to be in default regarding debt payments by credit rating agencies.[40][41] The crisis in Venezuela has contributed to a rapidly deteriorating human rights situation. The 2024 presidential election were not recognized by the Carter Center and Organization of American States due to the lack of granular results, and disputed by the opposition, leading to protests across the country.[42] According to the most popular and accepted version, in 1499, an expedition led by Alonso de Ojeda visited the Venezuelan coast. The stilt houses in the area of Lake Maracaibo reminded the Italian navigator, Amerigo Vespucci, of the city of Venice, Italy, so he named the region Veneziola, or \"Little Venice\".[43] The Spanish version of Veneziola is Venezuela.[44] Mart√≠n Fern√°ndez de Enciso, a member of the Vespucci and Ojeda crew, gave a different account. In his work Summa de geograf√≠a, he states that the crew found Indigenous peoples who called themselves the Veneciuela. Thus, the name \"Venezuela\" may have evolved from the native word.[45] Previously, the official name was Estado de Venezuela (1830‚Äì1856), Rep√∫blica de Venezuela (1856‚Äì1864), Estados Unidos de Venezuela (1864‚Äì1953), and again Rep√∫blica de Venezuela (1953‚Äì1999). Evidence exists of human habitation in the area now known as Venezuela from about 15,000 years ago. Tools have been found on the high riverine terraces of the Rio Pedregal in western Venezuela.[46] Late Pleistocene hunting artifacts, including spear tips, have been found at a similar series of sites in northwestern Venezuela; according to radiocarbon dating, these date from 13,000 to 7,000 BC.[47] It is unknown how many people lived in Venezuela before the Spanish conquest; it has been estimated at one million.[48] In addition to Indigenous peoples known today, the population included groups such as the Kalina (Caribs), Auak√©, Caquetio, Mariche, and Timoto‚ÄìCuicas. The Timoto‚ÄìCuica culture was the most complex society in Pre-Columbian Venezuela, with pre-planned permanent villages, surrounded by irrigated, terraced fields.[49] Their houses were made of stone and wood with thatched roofs. They were peaceful and depended on growing crops. Regional crops included potatoes and ullucos.[50] They left behind art, particularly anthropomorphic ceramics, but no major monuments. They spun vegetable fibers to weave into textiles and mats for housing. They are credited with having invented the arepa, a staple in Venezuelan cuisine.[51] After the conquest, the population dropped markedly, mainly through the spread of infectious diseases from Europe.[48] Two main north‚Äìsouth axes of pre-Columbian population were present, who cultivated maize in the west and manioc in the east.[48] Large parts of the llanos were cultivated through a combination of slash and burn and permanent settled agriculture.[48] In 1498, during his third voyage to the Americas, Christopher Columbus sailed near the Orinoco Delta and landed in the Gulf of Paria.[52] Amazed by the great offshore current of freshwater which deflected his course eastward, Columbus expressed in a letter to Isabella and Ferdinand that he must have reached Heaven on Earth (terrestrial paradise): Great signs are these of the Terrestrial Paradise... for I have never read or heard of such a large quantity of fresh water being inside and in such close proximity to salt water; the very mild temperateness also corroborates this; and if the water of which I speak does not proceed from Paradise then it is an even greater marvel, because I do not believe such a large and deep river has ever been known to exist in this world.[53] Spain's colonization of mainland Venezuela started in 1522, establishing its first permanent South American settlement in the present-day[update] city of Cuman√°. In the 16th century, the king of Spain granted a concession to the German Welser family. Klein-Venedig [54] became the most extensive initiative in the German colonization of the Americas from 1528 to 1546. The Welsers were bankers to the Habsburgs and financiers of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, who was King of Spain and had borrowed heavily from them to pay bribes for his Imperial election.[55] In 1528, Charles V granted the Welsers the right to explore, rule and colonize the territory, as well as to seek the mythical golden town of El Dorado.[56][57][58] The first expedition was led by Ambrosius Ehinger, who established Maracaibo in 1529. After the deaths of first Ehinger (1533), then Nikolaus Federmann, and Georg von Speyer (1540), Philipp von Hutten persisted in exploring the interior. In absence of von Hutten from the capital of the province, the crown of Spain claimed the right to appoint a governor. On Hutten's return to the capital, Santa Ana de Coro, in 1546, the Spanish governor Juan de Carvajal had Hutten and Bartholomeus VI. Welser executed. Subsequently, Charles V revoked Welser's concession. The Welsers transported German miners to the colony, in addition to 4,000 African slaves to plant sugar cane plantations. Many German colonists died from tropical diseases, to which they had no immunity, or through wars with the Indigenous inhabitants. Native caciques (leaders) such as Guaicaipuro (c. 1530‚Äì1568) and Tamanaco (died 1573) attempted to resist Spanish incursions, but the newcomers ultimately subdued them.[59] In the 16th century, during the Spanish colonization, indigenous peoples such as the Mariches, themselves descendants of the Kalina, were converted to Roman Catholicism. Some resisting tribes or leaders are commemorated in place names, including Caracas, Chacao and Los Teques. The early colonial settlements focused on the northern coast,[48] but in the mid-18th century, the Spanish pushed farther inland along the Orinoco River. Here, the Ye'kuana organized resistance in 1775‚Äì76.[60] Spain's eastern Venezuelan settlements were incorporated into New Andalusia Province. Administered by the Royal Audiencia of Santo Domingo from the early 16th century, most of Venezuela became part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada in the early 18th century, and was then reorganized as an autonomous Captaincy General starting in 1777. Caracas, founded in the central coastal region in 1567, was well-placed to become a key location, being near the coastal port of La Guaira and in a valley, in a mountain range, providing defensive strength against pirates and a more fertile and healthy climate.[61] After unsuccessful uprisings, Venezuela, under the leadership of Francisco de Miranda, a Venezuelan marshal who had fought in the American and French Revolutions, declared independence as the First Republic of Venezuela on 5 July 1811.[62] This began the Venezuelan War of Independence. A devastating 1812 Caracas earthquake, together with the rebellion of the Venezuelan llaneros, helped bring down the republic.[63] Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, new leader of the independentist forces, launched his Admirable Campaign in 1813 from New Granada, retaking most of the territory and being proclaimed as El Libertador (\"The Liberator\"). A Second Republic of Venezuela was proclaimed on 7 August 1813, but lasted only a few months before being crushed by royalist caudillo Jos√© Tom√°s Boves and his personal army of llaneros.[64] The end of the French invasion of homeland Spain in 1814 allowed a large expeditionary force to come under general Pablo Morillo, with the goal to regain the lost territory in Venezuela and New Granada. As the war reached a stalemate on 1817, Bol√≠var reestablished the Third Republic of Venezuela on the territory still controlled by the patriots, mainly in the Guayana and Llanos regions. This republic was short-lived as only two years later, during the Congress of Angostura of 1819, the union of Venezuela with New Granada was decreed to form the Republic of Colombia. The war continued until full victory and sovereignty was attained after the Battle of Carabobo on 24 June 1821.[65] On 24 July 1823, Jos√© Prudencio Padilla and Rafael Urdaneta helped seal Venezuelan independence with their victory in the Battle of Lake Maracaibo.[18] New Granada's congress gave Bol√≠var control of the Granadian army; leading it, he liberated several countries and founded the Republic of Colombia (Gran Colombia).[65] Sucre went on to liberate Ecuador and become the second president of Bolivia. Venezuela remained part of Gran Colombia until 1830, when a rebellion led by Jos√© Antonio P√°ez allowed the proclamation of a newly independent Venezuela, on 22 September;[66] P√°ez became the first president of the new State of Venezuela.[67] Between one-quarter and one-third of Venezuela's population was lost during these two decades of war (including about half the Venezuelans of European descent),[68] which by 1830, was estimated at 800,000.[69] In the Flag of Venezuela, the yellow stands for land wealth, the blue for the sea that separates Venezuela from Spain, and the red for the blood shed by the heroes of independence.[70] Slavery in Venezuela was abolished in 1854.[69] Much of Venezuela's 19th-century history was characterized by political turmoil and dictatorial rule, including the Independence leader Jos√© Antonio P√°ez, who gained the presidency three times and served 11 years between 1830 and 1863. This culminated in the Federal War (1859‚Äì63). In the latter half of the century, Antonio Guzm√°n Blanco, another caudillo, served 13 years, between 1870 and 1887, with three other presidents interspersed. In 1895, a longstanding dispute with Great Britain about the Essequibo territory, which Britain claimed as part of British Guiana and Venezuela saw as Venezuelan territory, erupted into the Venezuela Crisis of 1895. The dispute became a diplomatic crisis when Venezuela's lobbyist, William L. Scruggs, sought to argue that British behavior over the issue violated the United States' Monroe Doctrine of 1823, and used his influence in Washington, D.C., to pursue the matter. Then, U.S. president Grover Cleveland adopted a broad interpretation of the doctrine that declared an American interest in any matter within the hemisphere.[71] Britain ultimately accepted arbitration, but in negotiations over its terms was able to persuade the U.S. on many details. A tribunal convened in Paris in 1898 to decide the issue and in 1899 awarded the bulk of the disputed territory to British Guiana.[72] In 1899, Cipriano Castro, assisted by his friend Juan Vicente G√≥mez, seized power in Caracas. Castro defaulted on Venezuela's considerable foreign debts and declined to pay compensation to foreigners caught up in Venezuela's civil wars. This led to the Venezuela Crisis of 1902‚Äì1903, in which Britain, Germany and Italy imposed a naval blockade before international arbitration at the new Permanent Court of Arbitration was agreed. In 1908, another dispute broke out with the Netherlands, which was resolved when Castro left for medical treatment in Germany and was promptly overthrown by Juan Vicente G√≥mez (1908‚Äì35). The discovery of massive oil deposits in Lake Maracaibo during World War I[73] proved pivotal for Venezuela and transformed its economy from a heavy dependence on agricultural exports. It prompted a boom that lasted into the 1980s; by 1935, Venezuela's per capita gross domestic product was Latin America's highest.[74] G√≥mez benefited handsomely from this, as corruption thrived, but at the same time, the new source of income helped him centralize the state and develop its authority. G√≥mez remained the most powerful man in Venezuela until his death in 1935. The gomecista dictatorship (1935‚Äì1945) system largely continued under Eleazar L√≥pez Contreras, but from 1941, under Isa√≠as Medina Angarita, was relaxed. Angarita granted a range of reforms, including the legalization of all political parties. After World War II, immigration from Southern Europe and poorer Latin American countries markedly diversified Venezuelan society.[75] In 1945, a civilian-military coup overthrew Medina Angarita and ushered in a period of democratic rule (1945‚Äì1948) under the mass membership party Democratic Action, initially under R√≥mulo Betancourt, until R√≥mulo Gallegos won the 1947 Venezuelan presidential election (the first free and fair elections in Venezuela).[76][77] Gallegos governed until overthrown by a military junta led by the triumvirate Luis Felipe Llovera P√°ez [es], Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez, and Gallegos' Defense Minister, Carlos Delgado Chalbaud, in the 1948 Venezuelan coup d'√©tat. The most powerful man in the military junta (1948‚Äì58) was P√©rez Jim√©nez and he was suspected of being behind the death of Chalbaud, who died in a bungled kidnapping in 1950. When the junta unexpectedly lost the 1952 presidential election, it ignored the results and Jim√©nez was installed as president[citation needed] Jim√©nez was forced out on 23 January 1958.[18] In an effort to consolidate a young democracy, the three major political parties (Acci√≥n Democr√°tica (AD), COPEI and Uni√≥n Republicana Democr√°tica (URD), with the notable exception of the Communist Party of Venezuela), signed the Puntofijo Pact power-sharing agreement. AD and COPEI dominated the political landscape for four decades. During the presidencies of R√≥mulo Betancourt (1959‚Äì64, his second term) and Ra√∫l Leoni (1964‚Äì69), substantial guerilla movements occurred. Most laid down their arms under Rafael Caldera's first presidency (1969‚Äì74). Caldera had won the 1968 election for COPEI, the first time a party other than Democratic Action took the presidency through a democratic election. The new democratic order had its antagonists. Betancourt suffered an attack planned by the Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo in 1960, and the leftists excluded from the Pact initiated an insurgency by organizing themselves into the Armed Forces of National Liberation, sponsored by the Communist Party and Fidel Castro. In 1962 they tried to destabilize the military corps, with failed revolts. Betancourt promoted a foreign policy, the Betancourt Doctrine, in which he only recognized elected governments by popular vote.[need quotation to verify] The 1973 Venezuelan presidential election of Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez coincided with an oil crisis, in which Venezuela's income exploded as oil prices soared; oil industries were nationalized in 1976. This led to massive increases in public spending, but also increases in external debts, until the collapse of oil prices during the 1980s crippled the economy. As the government started to devalue the currency in 1983 to face its financial obligations, standards of living fell dramatically. Failed economic policies and increasing corruption in government led to rising poverty and crime, worsening social indicators, and increased political instability.[78] In the 1980s, the Presidential Commission for State Reform (COPRE) emerged as a mechanism of political innovation. Venezuela decentralized its political system and diversified its economy, reducing the size of the state. COPRE operated as an innovation mechanism, also by incorporating issues into the political agenda, that were excluded from public deliberation by the main actors of the democratic system. The most discussed topics were incorporated into the public agenda: decentralization, political participation, municipalization, judicial order reforms and the role of the state in a new economic strategy. The social reality made the changes difficult to apply.[79] Economic crises in the 1980s and 1990s led to a political crisis. Hundreds of people were killed by security forces and the military in the Caracazo riots of 1989, during the second presidential term of Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez (1989‚Äì1993) and after the implementation of economic austerity measures.[80] Hugo Ch√°vez, who in 1982 had promised to depose the bipartisanship governments, used the growing anger at economic austerity measures to justify a coup attempt in February 1992;[81][82] a second coup d'√©tat attempt occurred in November.[82] President Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez (re-elected in 1988) was impeached under embezzlement charges in 1993, leading to the interim presidency of Ram√≥n Jos√© Vel√°squez (1993‚Äì1994). Coup leader Ch√°vez was pardoned in March 1994 by president Rafael Caldera (1994‚Äì1999, his second term), with a clean slate and his political rights reinstated, allowing Ch√°vez to win and maintain the presidency continuously from 1999 until his death in 2013. Ch√°vez won the elections of 1998, 2000, 2006 and 2012 and the presidential referendum of 2004. A collapse in confidence in the existing parties led to Hugo Ch√°vez being elected president in 1998 and the subsequent launch of a \"Bolivarian Revolution\", beginning with a 1999 constituent assembly to write a new Constitution. The Revolution refers to a left-wing populism social movement and political process led by Ch√°vez, who founded the Fifth Republic Movement in 1997 and the United Socialist Party of Venezuela in 2007. The \"Bolivarian Revolution\" is named after Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. According to Ch√°vez and other supporters, the \"Bolivarian Revolution\" sought to build a mass movement to implement Bolivarianism‚Äîpopular democracy, economic independence, equitable distribution of revenues, and an end to political corruption. They interpret Bol√≠var's ideas from a populist perspective, using socialist rhetoric. This led to formation of the Fifth Republic of Venezuela, commonly known as the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, that continues to the present day. Venezuela has been considered the Bolivarian Republic following the adoption of the new Constitution of 1999. Following Ch√°vez's election, Venezuela developed into a dominant-party system, dominated by the United Socialist Party of Venezuela. In April 2002, Ch√°vez was briefly ousted from power in the 2002 Venezuelan coup d'√©tat attempt following popular demonstrations by his opponents,[83] but Chavez returned after two days as a result of demonstrations by poor Ch√°vez supporters and actions by the military.[84][85] Ch√°vez remained in power after an all-out national strike that lasted from December 2002 to February 2003, including a strike/lockout in the state oil company PDVSA.[86] Capital flight before and during the strike led to the reimposition of currency controls. In the subsequent decade, the government was forced into currency devaluations.[87][88][89][90] These devaluations did not improve the situation[vague] of the people who rely on imported products or locally produced products that depend on imported inputs, while dollar-denominated oil sales account for the majority of exports.[91] The profits of the oil industry have been lost to \"social engineering\" and corruption, instead of investments needed to maintain oil production.[92] Ch√°vez survived further political tests, including an August 2004 recall referendum. He was elected for another term in December 2006 and for a third term in October 2012. However, he was never sworn in due to medical complications; he died in March 2013.[93] The presidential election that took place in April 2013, was the first since Ch√°vez took office in 1999 in which his name did not appear on the ballot.[94][self-published source?] Under the Bolivarian government, Venezuela went from being one of the richest countries in Latin America to one of the poorest.[95] Hugo Ch√°vez's socioeconomic policies of relying on oil sales and importing goods resulted in large amounts of debt, no change to corruption in Venezuela and culminated into a crisis in Venezuela.[95] As a result, the Venezuelan refugee crisis, the largest emigration of people in Latin America's history,[96] occurred, with over 7 million ‚Äì about 20% of the country's population ‚Äì emigrating.[97][98] Ch√°vez initiated Bolivarian missions, programs aimed at helping the poor.[99] Poverty began to increase into the 2010s.[27] Nicol√°s Maduro was picked by Chavez as his successor, appointing him vice president in 2013.[89][100][101] Maduro has been president of Venezuela since 14 April 2013, when he won the presidential election after Chavez' death, with 51% of the vote, against Henrique Capriles on 49%. The Democratic Unity Roundtable contested Maduro's election as fraud, but an audit of 56% of the vote showed no discrepancies,[102] and the Supreme Court of Venezuela ruled Maduro was the legitimate president.[103] Opposition leaders and some international media consider Maduro's government a dictatorship.[13][14][15] Since February 2014, hundreds of thousands have protested over high levels of criminal violence, corruption, hyperinflation, and chronic scarcity of basic goods due to government policies.[104][105][106] Demonstrations and riots have resulted in over 40 fatalities in the unrest between Chavistas and opposition protesters[107] and opposition leaders, including Leopoldo L√≥pez and Antonio Ledezma were arrested.[107][108][109] Human rights groups condemned the arrest of L√≥pez.[110] In the 2015 Venezuelan parliamentary election, the opposition gained a majority.[111] Venezuela devalued its currency in February 2013 due to rising shortages,[90][112] which included milk and other necessities. This led to an increase in malnutrition, especially among children.[113][114] The economy had become dependent on the exportation of oil, with crude accounting for 86% of exports,[115] and a high price per barrel to support social programs. Beginning in 2014 the price of oil plummeted from over $100 to $40. This placed pressure on the economy, which was no longer able to afford vast social programs. The Government began taking more money from PDVSA, the state oil company, resulting in a lack of reinvestment in fields and employees. Production decreased from its height of nearly 3 to 1 million barrels (480 to 160 thousand cubic metres) per day.[116][117][118] In 2014, Venezuela entered a recession,[119] and in 2015, had the world's highest inflation, surpassing 100%.[120] In 2017, Donald Trump's administration imposed more economic sanctions against PDVSA and Venezuelan officials.[121][122][123] Economic problems, as well as crime, were the causes of the 2014‚Äìpresent Venezuelan protests.[124][125] Since 2014, roughly 5.6 million people have fled Venezuela.[126] In January 2016, Maduro decreed an \"economic emergency\", revealing the extent of the crisis and expanding his powers.[127] In July 2016, Colombian border crossings were temporarily opened to allow Venezuelans to purchase food and basic health items.[128] In September 2016, a study[129] indicated 15% of Venezuelans were eating \"food waste discarded by commercial establishments\". 200 prison riots had occurred by October 2016.[130] The Maduro-aligned Supreme Tribunal, which had been overturning National Assembly decisions since the opposition took control, took over the functions of the assembly, creating the 2017 Venezuelan constitutional crisis.[13] In August 2017, the 2017 Constituent National Assembly was elected and stripped the National Assembly of its powers.[citation needed] The election raised concerns of an emerging dictatorship.[131] In December 2017, Maduro declared opposition parties barred from the following year's presidential vote after they boycotted mayoral polls.[132] Maduro won the 2018 election with 68% of the vote. The result was challenged by Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, France and the US who deemed it fraudulent and recognized Juan Guaid√≥ as president.[133][134][135] Other countries continued to recognize Maduro,[136][137] although China, facing financial pressure over its position, began hedging by decreasing loans, cancelling joint ventures, and signaling willingness to work with all parties.[138][139] In August 2019, Trump imposed an economic embargo against Venezuela.[140] In March 2020, Trump indicted Maduro and Venezuelan officials, on charges of drug trafficking, narcoterrorism, and corruption.[141] In June 2020, a report documented enforced disappearances that occurred in 2018‚Äì19. 724 enforced disappearances of political detainees were reported. The report stated that security forces subjected victims to torture. The report stated the government used enforced disappearances to silence opponents and other critical voices.[142][143] Maduro ran for a third consecutive term in the 2024 presidential election, while former diplomat Edmundo Gonz√°lez Urrutia represented the Unitary Platform (Spanish: Plataforma Unitaria Democr√°tica; PUD), the main opposition political alliance.[144][145] Polls conducted before the election indicated that Gonz√°lez would win by a wide margin. After the government-controlled National Electoral Council (CNE) announced partial results showing a narrow Maduro victory on 29 July, world leaders predominantly expressed skepticism of the claimed results and did not recognize the CNE claims[146][147] with only some exceptions.[148] Both Gonz√°lez and Maduro proclaimed themselves winners of the election. The results of the election were not recognized by the Carter Center and Organization of American States due to the lack of granular results, and disputed by the opposition, which claimed a landslide victory and released access to vote tallies collected by poll watchers from a majority of polling centers as proof.[149][150][151][152] In the aftermath of the announcement of results by the election authorities, protests broke out across the country. Venezuela is located in the north of South America; geologically, its mainland rests on the South American Plate. It has a total area of 916,445 km2 (353,841 sq mi) and a land area of 882,050 km2 (340,560 sq mi), making Venezuela the 33rd largest country in the world. The territory it controls lies between latitudes 0¬∞ and 16¬∞N and longitudes 59¬∞ and 74¬∞W. Shaped roughly like a triangle, the country has a 2,800 km (1,700 mi) coastline in the north, which includes numerous islands in the Caribbean and the northeast borders the northern Atlantic Ocean. Most observers describe Venezuela in terms of four fairly well defined topographical regions: the Maracaibo lowlands in the northwest, the northern mountains extending in a broad east‚Äìwest arc from the Colombian border along the northern Caribbean coast, the wide plains in central Venezuela, and the Guiana Highlands in the southeast. The northern mountains are the extreme northeastern extensions of South America's Andes mountain range. Pico Bol√≠var, the nation's highest point at 4,979 m (16,335 ft), lies in this region. To the south, the dissected Guiana Highlands contain the northern fringes of the Amazon Basin and Angel Falls, the world's highest waterfall, as well as tepuis, large table-like mountains. The country's center is characterized by the llanos, which are extensive plains that stretch from the Colombian border in the far west to the Orinoco River delta in the east. The Orinoco, with its rich alluvial soils, binds the largest and most important river system of the country; it originates in one of the largest watersheds in Latin America. The Caron√≠ and the Apure are other major rivers. Venezuela borders Colombia to the west, Guyana to the east, and Brazil to the south. Caribbean islands such as Trinidad and Tobago, Grenada, Cura√ßao, Aruba, and the Leeward Antilles lie near the Venezuelan coast. Venezuela has territorial disputes with Guyana, formerly United Kingdom, largely concerning the Essequibo area and with Colombia concerning the Gulf of Venezuela. In 1895, after years of diplomatic attempts to solve the border dispute, the dispute over the Essequibo River border flared up. It was submitted to a \"neutral\" commission (composed of British, American, and Russian representatives and without a direct Venezuelan representative), which in 1899 decided mostly against Venezuela's claim.[citation needed] Venezuela is entirely located in the tropics over the Equator to around 12¬∞ N. Its climate varies from humid low-elevation plains, where average annual temperatures range as high as 35 ¬∞C (95.0 ¬∞F), to glaciers and highlands (the p√°ramos) with an average yearly temperature of 8 ¬∞C (46.4 ¬∞F). Annual rainfall varies from 430 mm (16.9 in) in the semiarid portions of the northwest to over 1,000 mm (39.4 in) in the Orinoco Delta of the far east and the Amazonian Jungle in the south. The precipitation level is lower in the period from August through April. These periods are referred to as hot-humid and cold-dry seasons. Another characteristic of the climate is this variation throughout the country by the existence of a mountain range called \"Cordillera de la Costa\" which crosses the country from east to west. The majority of the population lives in these mountains.[153] The country falls into four horizontal temperature zones based primarily on elevation, having tropical, dry, temperate with dry winters, and polar (alpine tundra) climates, amongst others.[154][155][156] In the tropical zone‚Äîbelow 800 m (2,625 ft)‚Äîtemperatures are hot, with yearly averages ranging between 26 and 28 ¬∞C (78.8 and 82.4 ¬∞F). The temperate zone ranges between 800 and 2,000 m (2,625 and 6,562 ft) with averages from 12 to 25 ¬∞C (53.6 to 77.0 ¬∞F); many of Venezuela's cities, including the capital, lie in this region. Colder conditions with temperatures from 9 to 11 ¬∞C (48.2 to 51.8 ¬∞F) are found in the cool zone between 2,000 and 3,000 m (6,562 and 9,843 ft), especially in the Venezuelan Andes, where pastureland and permanent snowfield with yearly averages below 8 ¬∞C (46 ¬∞F) cover land above 3,000 meters (9,843 ft) in the p√°ramos. The highest temperature recorded was 42 ¬∞C (108 ¬∞F) in Machiques,[157] and the lowest temperature recorded was ‚àí11 ¬∞C (12 ¬∞F), reported from an uninhabited high altitude at P√°ramo de Piedras Blancas (M√©rida state).[158] Venezuela lies within the Neotropical realm; large portions of the country were originally covered by moist broadleaf forests. One of 17 megadiverse countries,[159] Venezuela's habitats range from the Andes Mountains in the west to the Amazon Basin rainforest in the south, via extensive llanos plains and Caribbean coast in the center and the Orinoco River Delta in the east. They include xeric scrublands in the extreme northwest and coastal mangrove forests in the northeast.[153] Its cloud forests and lowland rainforests are particularly rich.[160] Animals of Venezuela are diverse and include manatees, three-toed sloth, two-toed sloth, Amazon river dolphins, and Orinoco Crocodiles, which have been reported to reach up to 6.6 m (22 ft) in length. Venezuela hosts a total of 1,417 bird species, 48 of which are endemic.[161] Important birds include ibises, ospreys, kingfishers,[160] and the yellow-orange Venezuelan troupial, the national bird. Notable mammals include the giant anteater, jaguar, and the capybara, the world's largest rodent. More than half of Venezuelan avian and mammalian species are found in the Amazonian forests south of the Orinoco.[162] For the fungi, an account was provided by R.W.G. Dennis[163] which has been digitized and the records made available on-line as part of the Cybertruffle Robigalia database.[164] That database includes nearly 3,900 species of fungi recorded from Venezuela, but is far from complete, and the true total number of fungal species already known from Venezuela is likely higher, given the generally accepted estimate that only about 7% of all fungi worldwide have so far been discovered.[165] Among plants of Venezuela, over 25,000 species of orchids are found in the country's cloud forest and lowland rainforest ecosystems.[160] These include the flor de mayo orchid (Cattleya mossiae), the national flower. Venezuela's national tree is the araguaney. The tops of the tepuis are also home to several carnivorous plants including the marsh pitcher plant, Heliamphora, and the insectivorous bromeliad, Brocchinia reducta. Venezuela is among the top 20 countries in terms of endemism.[166] Among its animals, 23% of reptilian and 50% of amphibian species, including the Trinidad poison frog, are endemic.[166][167] Although the available information is still very small, a first effort has been made to estimate the number of fungal species endemic to Venezuela: 1334 species of fungi have been tentatively identified as possibly endemic.[168] Some 38% of the over 21,000 plant species known from Venezuela are unique to the country.[166] Venezuela is one of the 10 most biodiverse countries on the planet, yet it is one of the leaders of deforestation due to economic and political factors. Each year, roughly 287,600 hectares of forest are permanently destroyed, and other areas are degraded by mining, oil extraction, and logging. Between 1990 and 2005, Venezuela officially lost 8.3% of its forest cover, which is about 4.3 million ha. In response, federal protections for critical habitat were implemented; for example, 20% to 33% of forested land is protected.[162] The country's biosphere reserve is part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves; five wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention.[169] In 2003, 70% of the nation's land was under conservation management in over 200 protected areas, including 43 national parks.[170] Venezuela's 43 national parks include Canaima National Park, Morrocoy National Park, and Mochima National Park. In the far south is a reserve for the country's Yanomami tribes. Covering 32,000 square miles (82,880 square kilometres), the area is off-limits to farmers, miners, and all non-Yanomami settlers. Venezuela was one of the few countries that did not enter an INDC at COP21.[172][173] Many terrestrial ecosystems are considered endangered, specially the dry forest in the northern regions of the country and the coral reefs in the Caribbean coast.[174][175][176] There are 105 protected areas in Venezuela, which cover around 26% of the country's continental, marine and insular surface.[citation needed] The country is made up of three river basins: the Caribbean Sea, the Atlantic Ocean and Lake Valencia, which forms an endorheic basin.[177] On the Atlantic side it drains most of Venezuela's river waters. The largest basin in this area is the extensive Orinoco basin[178] whose surface area, close to one million km2, is greater than that of the whole of Venezuela, although it has a presence of 65% in the country. The size of this basin - similar to that of the Danube - makes it the third largest in South America, and it gives rise to a flow of some 33,000 m3/s, making the Orinoco the third largest in the world, and also one of the most valuable from the point of view of renewable natural resources. The Rio or Brazo Casiquiare is unique in the world, as it is a natural derivation of the Orinoco that, after some 500 km in length, connects it to the Negro River, which in turn is a tributary of the Amazon. The Orinoco receives directly or indirectly rivers such as the Ventuari, the Caura, the Caron√≠, the Meta, the Arauca, the Apure and many others. Other Venezuelan rivers that empty into the Atlantic are the waters of the San Juan and Cuyun√≠ basins. Finally, there is the Amazon River, which receives the Guain√≠a, the Negro and others. Other basins are the Gulf of Paria and the Esequibo River. The second most important watershed is the Caribbean Sea. The rivers of this region are usually short and of scarce and irregular flow, with some exceptions such as the Catatumbo, which originates in Colombia and drains into the Maracaibo Lake basin. Among the rivers that reach the Maracaibo lake basin are the Chama, the Escalante, the Catatumbo, and the contributions of the smaller basins of the Tocuyo, Yaracuy, Never√≠ and Manzanares rivers. A minimum drains to the Lake Valencia basin.[179] Of the total extension of the rivers, a total of 5400 km are navigable. Other rivers worth mentioning are the Apure, Arauca, Caura, Meta, Barima, Portuguesa, Ventuari and Zulia, among others. The country's main lakes are Lake Maracaibo[180] -the largest in South America- open to the sea through the natural channel, but with fresh water, and Lake Valencia with its endorheic system. Other noteworthy bodies of water are the Guri reservoir, the Altagracia lagoon, the Camatagua reservoir and the Mucubaj√≠ lagoon in the Andes. The Venezuelan natural landscape[181] is the product of the interaction of tectonic plates[181] that since the Paleozoic have contributed to its current appearance. On the formed structures, seven physical-natural units have been modeled, differentiated in their relief and in their natural resources. The relief of Venezuela has the following characteristics: coastline with several peninsulas[182] and islands, adenas of the Andes mountain range (north and northwest), Lake Maracaibo (between the chains, on the coast);[183] Orinoco river delta,[184] region of peneplains and plateaus (tepui, east of the Orinoco) that together form the Guyanas massif (plateaus, southeast of the country). The oldest rock formations in South America are found in the complex basement of the Guyanas highlands[185] and in the crystalline line of the Maritime and Cordillera massifs in Venezuela. The Venezuelan part of the Guyanas Altiplano consists of a large granite block of gneiss and other crystalline Archean rocks, with underlying layers of sandstone and shale clay.[186] The core of granite and cordillera is, to a large extent, flanked by sedimentary layers from the Cretaceous,[187] folded in an anticline structure. Between these orographic systems there are plains covered with tertiary and quaternary layers of gravel, sands and clayey marls. The depression contains lagoons and lakes, among which is that of Maracaibo, and presents, on the surface, alluvial deposits from the Quaternary.[188] Also known as the Cordillera de la Costa, stretches along Venezuela's northern coast. This region is known for its lush tropical rainforests, stunning coastal views, and a rich variety of flora and fauna. The intermountain depressions, or valleys, between the mountain ranges are often home to fertile agricultural land and vibrant communities. These valleys offer a stark contrast to the rugged mountains that rise dramatically from the coast. Situated in northwestern Venezuela, the Lara-Falc√≥n Highlands exhibit a terrain defined by plateaus and rolling hills. These highlands provide a significant contrast to the surrounding lowlands and coastal areas. The relief is characterized by gently sloping plateaus that support agriculture, including coffee and cacao cultivation. This region's semi-arid climate and picturesque landscapes make it an important agricultural and tourism center. Encompass the basin of Lake Maracaibo and the plains surrounding the Gulf of Venezuela. This region offers two distinct plains‚Äîthe northern one is relatively dry, while the southern one is humid and dotted with swamps. The relief here is primarily characterized by flat terrain, with the exception of some elevated areas near the lake. Lake Maracaibo itself sits in a depression, surrounded by oil-rich lands and productive agricultural areas.[183] The Venezuelan Andes, part of the broader Andes mountain range, offer a striking relief with towering peaks, deep valleys, and fertile intermontane basins. Dominated by these corpulent mountain ranges, including Venezuela's highest peak, Bol√≠var Peak, the region's rugged and picturesque landscapes are defined by its high-altitude terrain. The unique relief of this area finds its origins in the Last Glacial Period, where the interplay of repeated glacier advances and retreats sculpted the landscape, shaped by the cold, high-altitude climate. This glacial heritage has left a lasting imprint, with glaciers carving deep valleys and polishing rugged peaks, while sheltered intramontane valleys offer fertile soils and temperate microclimates, creating ideal conditions for agriculture and human settlement. Los Llanos, or \"the plains\", are expansive sedimentary basins characterized by predominantly flat relief.[189] However, the eastern Llanos feature low-plateaus and the Unare depression, created through mesa erosion, adding diversity to the terrain. This region is subject to seasonal flooding, transforming the flat plains into a vast wetland during the rainy season. The relief here influences the region's unique ecosystems, including extensive grasslands and abundant wildlife. The Guiana Shield boasts a varied relief shaped by geological processes over millions of years. This region encompasses peneplains, rugged mountain ranges, foothills, and the iconic tepuis, or table-top mountains. The tepuis stand as isolated, flat-topped plateaus that rise dramatically from the surrounding terrain. This unique relief contributes to the region's remarkable biodiversity and scientific significance.[185] The Orinoco Delta's relief is characterized by a complex system of lands and waters. It consists of numerous channels, islands, and shifting sedimentary deposits. While the relief may appear relatively uniform, it conceals a dynamic environment influenced by seasonal flooding and sediment deposition. This complex deltaic relief supports diverse aquatic life and the livelihoods of Indigenous communities adapted to its ever-changing landscapes.[184] The valleys are undoubtedly the most important type of landscape in the Venezuelan territory,[190] not because of their spatial extension, but because they are the environment where most of the country's population and economic activities are concentrated. On the other hand, there are valleys throughout almost all the national space, except in the great sedimentary basins of the Llanos and the depression of the Maracaibo Lake, except also in the Amazonian peneplains.[191] By their modeling, the valleys of the Venezuelan territory belong mainly to two types: valleys of fluvial type and valleys of glacial type.[192] Much more frequent, the former largely dominate the latter, which are restricted to the highest parts of the Andes. Moreover, most glacial valleys are relics of a past geologic epoch, which culminated some 10,000 to 12,000 years ago. The deep and narrow Andean valleys are very different from the wide depressions of Aragua and Carabobo, in the Cordillera de la Costa, or from the valleys nestled in the Mesas de Monagas. These examples indicate that the configuration of the local relief is decisive in identifying regional types of valleys. Likewise, due to their warm climate, the Guayana valleys are distinguished from the temperate or cold Andean valleys by their humid environment. Both are, in turn, different from the semi-arid depressions of the states of Lara and Falc√≥n. The Andean valleys, essentially agricultural, precociously populated but nowadays in loss of speed, do not confront the same problems of space occupation as the strongly urbanized and industrialized valleys of the central section of the Cordillera de la Costa. On the other hand, the unpopulated and practically untouched Guiana valleys are another category this area is called the Lost World (Mundo Perdido).[191] The Andean valleys are undoubtedly the most impressive of the Venezuelan territory because of the energy of the encasing reliefs, whose summits often dominate the valley bottoms by 3,000 to 3,500 meters of relative altitude. They are also the most picturesque in terms of their style of habitat, forms of land use, handicraft production and all the traditions linked to these activities.[191] Venezuela has a great diversity of landscapes and climates,[193] including arid and dry areas. The main desert in the country is in the state of Falcon near the city of Coro. It is now a protected park, the M√©danos de Coro National Park.[194] The park is the largest of its kind in Venezuela, covering 91 square kilometres. The landscape is dotted with cacti and other xerophytic plants that can survive in humidity-free conditions near the desert. Desert wildlife includes mostly lizards, iguanas and other reptiles. Although less frequent, the desert is home to some foxes, giant anteaters and rabbits. There are also some native bird populations, such as the sparrowhawk, tropical mockingbird, scaly dove and crested quail. Other desert areas in the country include part of the Guajira Desert in the Guajira Municipality in the north of Zulia State[195] and facing the Gulf of Venezuela, the M√©danos de Capanaparo[196] in the Santos Luzardo National Park in Apure State, the Medanos de la Isla de Zapara[197] in Zulia State, the so-called Hundici√≥n de Yay[198] in the Andr√©s Eloy Blanco Municipality of Lara State, and the Urumaco Formation also in Falc√≥n State. Two major blocs of political parties are in Venezuela: the incumbent leftist bloc United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), its major allies Fatherland for All (PPT) and the Communist Party of Venezuela (PCV), and the opposition bloc grouped into the electoral coalition Mesa de la Unidad Democr√°tica. This includes A New Era (UNT) together with allied parties Project Venezuela, Justice First, Movement for Socialism (MAS) and others. The Venezuelan president is elected by a vote, with direct and universal suffrage, and is both head of state and head of government. The term of office is six years, and (as of 15 February 2009) a president may be re-elected an unlimited number of times. The president appoints the vice president and decides the size and composition of the cabinet and makes appointments to it with the involvement of the legislature. The president can ask the legislature to reconsider portions of laws he finds objectionable, but a simple parliamentary majority can override these objections. The president may ask the National Assembly to pass an enabling act granting the ability to rule by decree in specified policy areas; this requires a two-thirds majority in the Assembly. Since 1959, six Venezuelan presidents have been granted such powers. The unicameral Venezuelan parliament is the Asamblea Nacional (\"National Assembly\"). The number of members is variable ‚Äì each state and the Capital district elect three representatives plus the result of dividing the state population by 1.1% of the total population of the country.[199] Three seats are reserved for representatives of Venezuela's Indigenous peoples. For the 2011‚Äì2016 period the number of seats is 165.[200] All deputies serve five-year terms. The voting age in Venezuela is 18. Voting is not compulsory.[201] The legal system of Venezuela belongs to the Continental Law tradition. The highest judicial body is the Supreme Tribunal of Justice or Tribunal Supremo de Justicia, whose magistrates are elected by parliament for a single twelve-year term. The National Electoral Council (Consejo Nacional Electoral, or CNE) is in charge of electoral processes; it is formed by five main directors elected by the National Assembly. Supreme Court president Luisa Estela Morales said in December 2009 that Venezuela had moved away from \"a rigid division of powers\" toward a system characterized by \"intense coordination\" between the branches of government. Morales clarified that each power must be independent.[202] Venezuela is divided into 23 states (estados), a capital district (distrito capital) corresponding to the city of Caracas, and the Federal Dependencies (Dependencias Federales, a special territory). Venezuela is further subdivided into 335 municipalities (municipios); these are subdivided into over one thousand parishes (parroquias). The states are grouped into nine administrative regions (regiones administrativas), which were established in 1969 by presidential decree.[citation needed] The country can be further divided into ten geographical areas, some corresponding to climatic and biogeographical regions. In the north are the Venezuelan Andes and the Coro region, a mountainous tract in the northwest, holds several sierras and valleys. East of it are lowlands abutting Lake Maracaibo and the Gulf of Venezuela.[citation needed] The Central Range runs parallel to the coast and includes the hills surrounding Caracas; the Eastern Range, separated from the Central Range by the Gulf of Cariaco, covers all of Sucre and northern Monagas. The Insular Region includes all of Venezuela's island possessions: Nueva Esparta and the various Federal Dependencies. The Orinoco Delta, which forms a triangle covering Delta Amacuro, projects northeast into the Atlantic Ocean.[citation needed] The country maintains a claim on the territory it calls \"Guayana Esequiba\", the territory administered by Guyana west of the Esequibo River. In 1966 the British and Venezuelan governments signed the Geneva Agreement to resolve the conflict peacefully. The Port of Spain Protocol of 1970 set a deadline to try to resolve the issue, without success to date.[citation needed] The 2015 parliamentary elections were held on 6 December 2015 to elect the 164 deputies and three Indigenous representatives of the National Assembly. In 2014, a series of protest and demonstrations began in Venezuela, attributed[by whom?] to inflation, violence and shortages in Venezuela. The protests were largely peaceful.[204][better source needed] The government has accused the protest of being motivated by fascists, opposition leaders, capitalism and foreign influence,[205] President Maduro acknowledged PSUV defeat but attributed the opposition's victory to an intensification of an economic war. Despite this, Maduro said, \"I will stop by hook or by crook the opposition coming to power, whatever the costs, in any way\".[206] In the following months, Maduro fulfilled his promise of preventing the elected National Assembly from legislating. The first steps taken by PSUV and government were the substitution of the entire Supreme Court a day after the parliamentary elections,[207] contrary to the Constitution of Venezuela, acclaimed as a fraud by the majority of the Venezuelan and international press.[208][209][210][211] The Financial Times described the function of the Supreme Court in Venezuela as \"rubber stamping executive whims and vetoing legislation\".[212] The PSUV government used this violation to suspend several elected opponents.[213] Maduro said that \"the Amnesty law (approved by the Parliament) will not be executed\" and asked the Supreme Court to declare it unconstitutional.[214] On 16 January 2016, Maduro approved an unconstitutional economic emergency decree,[215] relegating to his own figure the legislative and executive powers, while also holding judiciary power through the fraudulent designation of judges the day after the election on 6 December 2015.[207][208][209][211] From these events, Maduro effectively controls all three branches of government. On 14 May 2016, constitutional guarantees were in fact suspended when Maduro decreed the extension of the economic emergency decree for another 60 days and declared a State of Emergency,[216] which is a clear violation of the Constitution of Venezuela[217] in the Article 338th: \"The approval of the extension of States of emergency corresponds to the National Assembly.\" Thus, constitutional rights in Venezuela are considered suspended in fact by many publications[218][219][220] and public figures.[221][222][223] On 14 May 2016, the Organization of American States was considering the application of the Inter-American Democratic Charter[224] sanctions for non-compliance to its own constitution. In March 2017, the Venezuelan Supreme Court took over law making powers from the National Assembly[225] but reversed its decision the following day.[226] Throughout most of the 20th century, Venezuela maintained friendly relations with most Latin American and Western nations. Relations between Venezuela and the United States government worsened in 2002, after the 2002 Venezuelan coup d'√©tat attempt during which the U.S. government recognized the short-lived interim presidency of Pedro Carmona. In 2015, Venezuela was declared a national security threat by U.S. president Barack Obama.[227][228][229] Correspondingly, ties to various Latin American and Middle Eastern countries not allied to the U.S. have strengthened.[citation needed] Venezuela seeks alternative hemispheric integration via such proposals as the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas trade proposal and the newly launched Latin American television network teleSUR. Venezuela is one of five nations in the world‚Äîalong with Russia, Nicaragua, Nauru, and Syria‚Äîto have recognized the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Venezuela was a proponent of OAS's decision to adopt its Anti-Corruption Convention[230] and is actively working in the Mercosur trade bloc to push increased trade and energy integration. Globally, it seeks a \"multi-polar\" world based on strengthened ties among undeveloped countries.[citation needed] On 26 April 2017, Venezuela announced its intention to withdraw from the OAS.[231] Venezuelan Foreign Minister Delcy Rodr√≠guez said that President Nicol√°s Maduro plans to publicly renounce Venezuela's membership on 27 April 2017. It will take two years for the country to formally leave. During this period, the country does not plan on participating in the OAS.[232] Venezuela is involved in a long-standing disagreement about the control of the Guayana Esequiba area. Venezuela may suffer a deterioration of its power in international affairs if the global transition to renewable energy is completed. It is ranked 151 out of 156 countries in the index of Geopolitical Gains and Losses after energy transition (GeGaLo).[233] Venezuela is a charter member of the United Nations (UN), Organization of American States (OAS), Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA), Mercosur, Latin American Integration Association (LAIA) and Organization of Ibero-American States (OEI). The Bolivarian National Armed Forces (Fuerza Armada Nacional Bolivariana, FANB) are the unified military forces of Venezuela. It includes over 320,150 men and women, under Article 328 of the Constitution, in five components of ground, sea and air. The components of the FANB are: the Venezuelan Army, the Venezuelan Navy, the Venezuelan Air Force, the Venezuelan National Guard, and the Venezuelan National Militia. As of 2008[update], a further 600,000 soldiers were incorporated into a new branch, known as the Armed Reserve. The president of Venezuela is the commander-in-chief of the FANB. Its main purposes are to defend the sovereign national territory of Venezuela, airspace, and islands, fight against drug trafficking, search and rescue and, in the case of a natural disaster, civil protection. All male citizens of Venezuela have a constitutional duty to register for the military service at 18, which is the age of majority. In Venezuela, a person is murdered every 21 minutes.[242] Violent crimes have been so prevalent in Venezuela that the government no longer produces the crime data.[243] In 2013, the homicide rate was approximately 79 per 100,000, one of the world's highest, having quadrupled in the past 15 years with over 200,000 people murdered.[244] By 2015, it had risen to 90 per 100,000.[245] The capital Caracas has one of the greatest homicide rates of any large city in the world, with 122 homicides per 100,000 residents.[246] In 2008, polls indicated that crime was the number one concern of voters.[247] Attempts at fighting crime such as Operation Liberation of the People were implemented to crack down on gang-controlled areas[248] but, of reported criminal acts, less than 2% are prosecuted.[249] In 2017, the Financial Times noted that some of the arms procured by the government over the previous two decades had been diverted to paramilitary civilian groups and criminal syndicates.[212] Venezuela is especially dangerous for foreign travelers and investors who are visiting. The United States Department of State and the Government of Canada have warned foreign visitors that they may be subjected to robbery, kidnapping[250] and murder, and that their own diplomatic travelers are required to travel in armored vehicles.[251][252] The United Kingdom's Foreign and Commonwealth Office has advised against all travel to Venezuela.[253] Visitors have been murdered during robberies.[254][255] There are approximately 33 prisons holding about 50,000 inmates.[256] Venezuela's prison system is heavily overcrowded; its facilities have capacity for only 14,000 prisoners.[257] Human rights organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have increasingly criticized Venezuela's human rights record, with the former organization noting in 2017 that the Chavez and subsequently the Maduro government have increasingly concentrated power in the executive branch, eroded constitutional human rights protections and allowed the government to persecute and repress its critics and opposition.[258] Other persistent concerns as noted by the report included poor prison conditions, the continuous harassment of independent media and human rights defenders by the government. In 2006, the Economist Intelligence Unit rated Venezuela a \"hybrid regime\" and the third least democratic regime in Latin America on the Democracy Index.[259] The Democracy index downgraded Venezuela to an authoritarian regime in 2017, citing continued increasingly dictatorial behaviors by the Maduro government.[260] Corruption in Venezuela is high by world standards and was so for much of the 20th century. The discovery of oil worsened political corruption.[261] By the late 1970s, Juan Pablo P√©rez Alfonso's description of oil as \"the Devil's excrement\" had become a common expression in Venezuela.[262] The Corruption Perceptions Index has ranked Venezuela as one of the most corrupt countries since the survey started in 1995. The 2010 ranking placed Venezuela at number 164, out of 178 ranked countries in government transparency.[263] By 2016, the rank had increased to 166 out of 178.[264] The World Justice Project ranked Venezuela 99th out of 99 countries surveyed in its 2014 Rule of Law Index.[265] This corruption is shown with Venezuela's significant involvement in drug trafficking, with Colombian cocaine and other drugs transiting Venezuela towards the United States and Europe. In the period 2003‚Äì2008 Venezuelan authorities seized the fifth-largest total quantity of cocaine in the world, behind Colombia, the United States, Spain and Panama.[266] In 2006, the government's agency for combating illegal drug trade in Venezuela, ONA, was incorporated into the office of the vice-president. However, many major government and military officials have been known for their involvement with drug trafficking.[267] Almost 82 per cent of Venezuelans live in poverty, with 53 per cent in extreme poverty, unable to buy even basic foodstuffs. ‚Äì A UN special rapporteur said in February 2024 after visiting the country.[268] Venezuela was \"once among South America's wealthiest countries\" before the economic meltdown under Maduro regime.[269] \"The formerly rich petro-state has seen GDP fall by 80 percent in less than a decade, driving some seven million of its citizens to flee. Most Venezuelans live on just a few dollars a month, with the health care and education systems in total disrepair and biting shortages of electricity and fuel\" as of 2024, according to VOA (report from AFP).[270] The country has a market-based mixed economy dominated by the petroleum sector,[271][272] which accounts for roughly a third of GDP, around 80% of exports, and more than half of government revenues. Per capita GDP for 2016 was estimated to be US$15,100, ranking 109th in the world.[18] Venezuela has the least expensive petrol in the world because the consumer price of petrol is heavily subsidized. The private sector controls two-thirds of Venezuela's economy.[273] A part of the Venezuelan economy depends on remittances. The Central Bank of Venezuela is responsible for developing monetary policy for the Venezuelan bol√≠var which is used as currency. The president of the Central Bank of Venezuela serves as the country's representative in the International Monetary Fund. The U.S.-based conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation claims Venezuela has the weakest property rights in the world, scoring only 5.0 on a scale of 100; expropriation without compensation is not uncommon. As of 2011, more than 60% of Venezuela's international reserves was in gold, eight times more than the average for the region. Most of Venezuela's gold held abroad was located in London. On 25 November 2011, the first of US$11 billion of repatriated gold bullion arrived in Caracas; Ch√°vez called the repatriation of gold a \"sovereign\" step that will help protect the country's foreign reserves from the turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.[274] However government policies quickly spent down this returned gold and in 2013 the government was forced to add the dollar reserves of state owned companies to those of the national bank to reassure the international bond market.[275] Manufacturing contributed 17% of GDP in 2006. Venezuela manufactures and exports heavy industry products such as steel, aluminium and cement, with production concentrated around Ciudad Guayana, near the Guri Dam, one of the largest in the world and the provider of about three-quarters of Venezuela's electricity. Other notable manufacturing includes electronics and automobiles, as well as beverages, and foodstuffs. Agriculture in Venezuela accounts for approximately 3% of GDP, 10% of the labor force, and at least a quarter of Venezuela's land area. The country is not self-sufficient in most areas of agriculture.[citation needed] Since the discovery of oil in the early 20th century, Venezuela has been one of the world's leading exporters of oil, and it is a founding member of OPEC. Previously an underdeveloped exporter of agricultural commodities, oil quickly came to dominate exports and government revenues. The 1980s oil glut led to an external debt crisis and a long-running economic crisis, which saw inflation peak at 100% in 1996.[278] The 1990s also saw Venezuela experience a major banking crisis in 1994. The recovery of oil prices after 2001 boosted the Venezuelan economy and facilitated social spending. With social programs such as the Bolivarian Missions, Venezuela initially made progress in social development in the 2000s, particularly in areas such as health, education, and poverty. Many of the social policies pursued by Ch√°vez and his administration were jump-started by the Millennium Development Goals, eight goals that Venezuela and 188 other nations agreed to in September 2000.[279] The sustainability of the Bolivarian Missions has been questioned due to the Bolivarian state's overspending on public works and because the Ch√°vez government did not save funds for future economic hardships, with economic issues and poverty rising as a result of their policies in the 2010s.[32][280][281] In 2003 the government of Hugo Ch√°vez implemented currency controls after capital flight led to a devaluation of the currency. This led to the development of a parallel market of dollars in the subsequent years. The Great Recession led to a renewed economic downturn. Despite controversial data shared by the Venezuelan government showing that the country had halved malnutrition following one of the UN's Millennium Development Goals,[114][282] shortages of staple goods began to occur in Venezuela and malnutrition began to increase.[114] In early 2013, Venezuela devalued its currency due to growing shortages in the country.[112][283] The shortages included, and still include, necessities such as toilet paper, milk, and flour.[113] Fears rose so high due to the toilet paper shortage that the government occupied a toilet paper factory, and continued plans to nationalize other industrial aspects like food distribution.[284][285] Venezuela's bond ratings have also decreased multiple times in 2013 due to decisions by the president Nicol√°s Maduro.[286] In 2016, consumer prices in Venezuela increased 800% and the economy declined by 18.6%, entering an economic depression.[287][288] Venezuela's outlook was deemed negative by most bond-rating services in 2017.[289][290] For 2018 an inflation rate of 1,000,000 percent was projected, putting Venezuela in a similar situation to that in Germany in 1923 or Zimbabwe in the late 2000s.[291] Tourism has been developed considerably in recent decades, particularly because of its favorable geographical position, the variety of landscapes, the richness of plant and wildlife, the culture and the tropical climate. Margarita Island is one of the top tourist destinations. It is an island with a modern infrastructure, bordered by beaches suitable for extreme sports, and features castles, fortresses and churches of great cultural value. Los Roques Archipelago is made up of a set of islands and keys that constitute one of the main tourist attractions in the country. With exotic crystalline beaches, Morrocoy is a national park, formed by small keys very close to the mainland, which have grown rapidly as one of the greatest tourist attractions in the Venezuelan Caribbean.[292] Canaima National Park[293] extends over 30,000 km2 to the border with Guyana and Brazil; due to its size it is considered the sixth largest national park in the world. Its steep cliffs and waterfalls (including Angel Falls, which is the highest waterfall in the world, at 1,002 m) form spectacular landscapes. The state of M√©rida[294] is one of the main tourist centers of Venezuela. It has an extensive network of hotels not only in its capital city, but also throughout the state. Starting from the same city of M√©rida is the longest and highest cable car in the world, which reaches the Pico Espejo of 4,765 m. Shortages in Venezuela have been prevalent following the enactment of price controls and other policies during the economic policy of the Hugo Ch√°vez government.[295][296] Under the economic policy of the Nicol√°s Maduro government, greater shortages occurred due to the Venezuelan government's policy of withholding United States dollars from importers with price controls.[297] Shortages occur in regulated products, such as milk, various types of meat, coffee, rice, oil, flour, butter, and other goods including basic necessities like toilet paper, personal hygiene products, and even medicine.[295][298][299] As a result of the shortages, Venezuelans must search for food, wait in lines for hours and sometimes do without certain products.[300][301][302][303][304] A drought, combined with a lack of planning and maintenance, has caused a hydroelectricity shortage. To deal with lack of power supply, in April 2016 the Maduro government announced rolling blackouts[305] and reduced the government workweek to only Monday and Tuesday.[306] A multi-university study found that, in 2016 alone, about 75% of Venezuelans lost weight due to hunger, with the average losing about 8.6 kg (19 lbs) due to the lack of food.[307] In March 2017, Venezuela began having shortages of gasoline in some regions.[308] Venezuela has the largest oil reserves, and the eighth largest natural gas reserves in the world.[310] Compared to the preceding year another 40.4% in crude oil reserves were proven in 2010, allowing Venezuela to surpass Saudi Arabia as the country with the largest reserves of this type.[311] The country's main petroleum deposits are located around and beneath Lake Maracaibo, the Gulf of Venezuela (both in Zulia), and in the Orinoco River basin (eastern Venezuela), where the country's largest reserve is located. Besides the largest conventional oil reserves and the second-largest natural gas reserves in the Western Hemisphere,[312] Venezuela has non-conventional oil deposits (extra-heavy crude oil, bitumen and tar sands) approximately equal to the world's reserves of conventional oil.[313] The electricity sector in Venezuela is one of the few to rely primarily on hydropower, and includes the Guri Dam, one of the largest in the world. In the first half of the 20th century, U.S. oil companies were heavily involved in Venezuela, initially interested only in purchasing concessions.[314] In 1943 a new government introduced a 50/50 split in profits between the government and the oil industry. In 1960, with a newly installed democratic government, Hydrocarbons Minister Juan Pablo P√©rez Alfonso led the creation of OPEC, the consortium of oil-producing countries aiming to support the price of oil.[315] In 1973, Venezuela voted to nationalize its oil industry outright, effective 1 January 1976, with Petr√≥leos de Venezuela (PDVSA) taking over and presiding over a number of holding companies; in subsequent years, Venezuela built a vast refining and marketing system in the U.S. and Europe.[316] In the 1990s PDVSA became more independent from the government and presided over an apertura (opening) in which it invited in foreign investment. Under Hugo Ch√°vez a 2001 law placed limits on foreign investment. PDVSA played a key role in the December 2002 ‚Äì February 2003 national strike. As a result of the strike, around 40% of the company's workforce (around 18,000 workers) were dismissed.[317] Venezuela is connected to the world primarily via air (Venezuela's airports include the Sim√≥n Bol√≠var International Airport in Maiquet√≠a, near Caracas and La Chinita International Airport near Maracaibo) and sea (with major seaports at La Guaira, Maracaibo and Puerto Cabello). In the south and east the Amazon rainforest region has limited cross-border transport; in the west, there is a mountainous border of over 2,213 kilometres (1,375 mi) shared with Colombia. The Orinoco River is navigable by oceangoing vessels up to 400 kilometres (250 mi) inland and connects the major industrial city of Ciudad Guayana to the Atlantic Ocean. Venezuela has a limited national railway system, which has no active rail connections to other countries. The government of Hugo Ch√°vez tried to invest in expanding it, but Venezuela's rail project is on hold due to Venezuela not being able to pay the $7.5 billion[clarification needed] and owing China Railway nearly $500 million.[318] Several major cities have metro systems; the Caracas Metro has been operating since 1983. The Maracaibo Metro and Valencia Metro were opened more recently. Venezuela has a road network of nearly 100,000 kilometres (62,000 mi), placing the country around 45th in the world;[319] around a third of roads are paved. The electricity sector in Venezuela is heavily dependent on hydroelectricity, with this energy source accounting for 64% of the country's electricity generation in 2021.[309] Venezuela is among the most urbanized countries in Latin America;[22][23] the vast majority of Venezuelans live in the cities of the north, especially in the capital Caracas, which is also the largest city. About 93% of the population lives in urban areas in northern Venezuela; 73% live less than 100 kilometres (62 mi) from the coastline.[320] Though almost half of Venezuela's land area lies south of the Orinoco, only 5% of Venezuelans live there. The largest and most important city south of the Orinoco is Ciudad Guayana, which is the sixth most populous conurbation.[321] Other major cities include Barquisimeto, Valencia, Maracay, Maracaibo, Barcelona-Puerto La Cruz, M√©rida and San Crist√≥bal. According to the 2022 revision of the World Population Prospects[322][323] the total population was 28,199,867 in 2021. A 2014 study by sociologists of the Central University of Venezuela found over 1.5 million Venezuelans, or about 4% to 6% of the country's population, have left Venezuela since 1999.[324][325] The people of Venezuela come from a variety of ancestries. It is estimated that the majority of the population is of pardo, or mixed, ethnic ancestry. In the 2011 census, which Venezuelans were asked to identify themselves according to their customs and ancestry, the term pardo was excluded from the answers. The majority claimed to be moreno or white‚Äî51.6% and 43.6%, respectively.[1] Slightly more than half of the population claimed to be moreno, a term used throughout Ibero-America that in this case means \"dark-skinned\" or \"brown-skinned\", as opposed to having a lighter skin. Ethnic minorities in Venezuela consist of groups that descend mainly from African or Indigenous peoples; 2.8% identified themselves as \"black\" and 0.7% as afrodescendiente (Afro-descendant), 2.6% claimed to belong to Indigenous peoples, and 1.2% answered \"other races\".[1] Among Indigenous people, 58% were Way√∫u, 7% Warao, 5% Kari√±a, 4% Pem√≥n, 3% Piaroa, 3% Jivi, 3% A√±u, 3% Cuman√°goto, 2% Yukpa, 2% Chaima and 1% Yanomami; the remaining 9% consisted of other Indigenous nations.[326] According to an autosomal DNA study conducted in 2008 by the University of Bras√≠lia, the composition of Venezuela's population is 60.60% European, 23% Indigenous, and 16.30% African.[327] During the colonial period and until after the Second World War, many of the European immigrants to Venezuela came from the Canary Islands[328] and Spain[329] with a relevant amount of Galicians and Asturians. These immigrants from Spain had a significant cultural impact on the cuisine and customs of Venezuela.[330][331][332] These influences on Venezuela have led to the nation being called the 8th island of the Canaries.[333][334] With the start of oil exploitation in the early 20th century, companies from the United States began establishing operations in Venezuela, bringing with them U.S. citizens. Later, during and after the war, new waves of immigrants from other parts of Europe, the Middle East, and China began; many were encouraged by government-established immigration programs and lenient immigration policies.[335] During the 20th century, Venezuela, along with the rest of Latin America, received millions of immigrants from Europe.[336] This was especially true post-World War II, as a consequence of war-ridden Europe.[336][337] During the 1970s, while experiencing an oil-export boom, Venezuela received millions of immigrants from Ecuador, Colombia, and the Dominican Republic.[337] Due to the belief that this immigration influx depressed wages, some Venezuelans opposed European immigration.[337] The Venezuelan government, however, were actively recruiting immigrants from Eastern Europe to fill a need for engineers. Millions of Colombians, as well as Middle Eastern and Haitian populations would continue immigrating to Venezuela into the early 21st century.[335] According to the World Refugee Survey 2008, published by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, Venezuela hosted a population of refugee and asylum seekers from Colombia numbering 252,200 in 2007, and 10,600 new asylum seekers entered Venezuela in 2007.[338] Between 500,000 and one million illegal immigrants are estimated to be living in the country.[339] The total Indigenous population of the country is estimated at 500 thousand people (2.8% of the total), distributed among 40 Indigenous peoples.[340] There are three uncontacted tribes living in Venezuela. The Constitution recognizes the multi-ethnic, pluri-cultural, and multilingual character of the country and includes a chapter devoted to Indigenous peoples' rights, which opened up spaces for their political inclusion at national and local level in 1999. Most Indigenous peoples are concentrated in eight states along Venezuela's borders with Brazil, Guyana, and Colombia, and the majority groups are the Wayuu in the west, the Warao in the east, the Yanomami installed in the south, and the Pemon which are mostly in the southeast of Venezuela. Although most residents are monolingual Spanish speakers, many languages are spoken in Venezuela. In addition to Spanish, the Constitution recognizes more than thirty Indigenous languages, including Wayuu, Warao, Pem√≥n, and many others for the official use of the Indigenous peoples, mostly with few speakers ‚Äì less than 1% of the total population. Wayuu is the most spoken Indigenous language, with 170,000 speakers.[341] Immigrants, in addition to Spanish, speak their own languages. Chinese (400,000), Portuguese (254,000),[341] and Italian (200,000)[342] are the most-spoken languages in Venezuela after the official language of Spanish. Arabic is spoken by Lebanese and Syrian colonies on Isla de Margarita, Maracaibo, Punto Fijo, Puerto la Cruz, El Tigre, Maracay, and Caracas. Portuguese is spoken not only by the Portuguese community in Santa Elena de Uair√©n but also by much of the population due to its proximity to Brazil.[343] The German community speaks their native language, while the people of Colonia Tovar speak mostly an Alemannic dialect of German called alem√°n coloniero. English is the most widely used foreign language in demand and is spoken by many professionals, academics, and members of the upper and middle classes as a result of the oil exploration by foreign companies, in addition to its acceptance as a lingua franca. Culturally, English is common in southern towns like El Callao, and the native English-speaking (English-creole speaking) influence is evident in folk and calypso songs from the region. Various dialects of Eastern-Caribbean English-based creoles were brought to Venezuela by Trinidadian and other British West Indies immigrants,[344] they are collectively referred to as Venezuelan English Creole. A variety of Antillean Creole is spoken by a small community in El Callao and Paria.[345] Italian language teaching is delivered by private Venezuelan schools and institutions. Other languages spoken by large communities in the country are Basque and Galician, among others. Religion in Venezuela (2011)[346] According to a 2011 poll, 88% of the population is Christian, primarily Roman Catholic (71%), and the remaining 17% Protestant, primarily Evangelicals (in Latin America Protestants are usually called \"evang√©licos\"). 8% of Venezuelans are irreligious. Almost 3% of the population follow another religion (1% of these people practice Santer√≠a).[346] There are small but influential Muslim, Druze,[347][348] Buddhist, and Jewish communities. The Muslim community of more than 100,000 is concentrated among persons of Lebanese and Syrian descent living in Nueva Esparta state, Punto Fijo and the Caracas area. Venezuela is home of the largest Druze communities outside the Middle East,[349] the Druze community are estimated around 60,000,[349] and concentrated among persons of Lebanese and Syrian descent.[350][347] Buddhism is practiced by over 52,000 people. The Buddhist community is made up mainly of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean people. The Jewish community has shrunk in recent years due to rising economic pressures and antisemitism in Venezuela,[351][352][353][354] with the population declining from 22,000 in 1999[355] to less than 7,000 in 2015.[356] Venezuela has a national universal health care system. The current government has created a program to expand access to health care known as Misi√≥n Barrio Adentro,[357][358] although its efficiency and work conditions have been criticized.[359][360][361] As of December 2014 an estimated 80% of Barrio Adentro establishments in Venezuela are abandoned.[362][363] Infant mortality in Venezuela was 19 deaths per 1,000 births for 2014 which was lower than the South American average (To compare: The U.S. figure was 6 deaths per 1,000 births in 2013).[18] Child malnutrition was 17%. Delta Amacuro and Amazonas had the nation's highest rates.[364] According to the United Nations, 32% of Venezuelans lacked adequate sanitation, primarily those living in rural areas.[365] Diseases ranging from diphtheria, plague, malaria,[249] typhoid fever, yellow fever, cholera, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis D were present in the country.[366] Obesity was prevalent in approximately 30% of the adult population.[18] Venezuela had a total of 150 sewage treatment plants; 13% of the population lacked access to drinking water, but this number had been dropping.[367][non-primary source needed] During the economic crisis observed under President Maduro's presidency, medical professionals were forced to perform outdated treatments on patients.[368] In 2008, 95.2% of the adult population was literate.[372] The net primary school enrollment rate was at 91% and the net secondary school enrollment rate was at 63% in 2005.[372] Venezuela has a number of universities, of which the most prestigious are the Central University of Venezuela founded in 1721, the University of Zulia, the University of the Andes, Sim√≥n Bol√≠var University, and the University of the East. Currently, many Venezuelan graduates seek a future abroad because of the country's troubled economy and heavy crime rate. Over 1.35 million Venezuelan college graduates have left the country since the beginning of the Bolivarian Revolution.[324][325] It is believed that nearly 12% of Venezuelans live abroad, with Ireland becoming a popular destination for students.[373] According to Claudio Bifano, president of the Venezuelan Academy of Physical, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences, more than half of all medical graduates had left Venezuela in 2013.[374] By 2018, over half of all Venezuelan children had dropped out of school, with 58% of students quitting nationwide while areas near bordering countries saw more than 80% of their students leave.[375][376] Nationwide, about 93% of schools do not meet the minimum requirements to operate and 77% do not have utilities such as food, water or electricity.[376] The culture of Venezuela is a melting pot made up of three main groups: The Indigenous Venezuelans, the Africans, and the Spanish. The Africans brought in many musical influences, especially introduction of the drum. The Spanish influence predominantes due to the colonization process and the socioeconomic structure it created. Spanish influences can be seen in the country's architecture, music, religion, and language. Venezuela was also enriched by immigration streams of Indian and European origin in the 19th century, especially from France. Most recently, immigration from the United States, Spain, Italy, and Portugal has enriched the already complex cultural mosaic.[citation needed] Carlos Ra√∫l Villanueva[378] was the most important Venezuelan architect of the modern era; he designed the Central University of Venezuela, (a World Heritage Site) and its Aula Magna. Other notable architectural works include the Capitolio, the Baralt Theatre, the Teresa Carre√±o Cultural Complex, and the General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge. In Venezuela, prehistoric man began to build useful architecture from approximately 1000 BC to the 15th century AD, in the period known as the \"Neo-Indian\". Neo-Indian architecture consisted of incipient constructions, such as agricultural terraces and vaults lined by stones, called mintoyes, which were used as tombs and silos for the storage of agricultural products. The Indo-Hispanic architecture is the one that begins to develop from the year 1498 AD.[379] Venezuelan colonial architecture is built from the 16th century, when Venezuela began to be a dependent colony of the Spanish Empire,[380] until 1810, when the process of Venezuelan independence began. The architecture of this period is characterized by its discreet modesty, with the exception of some cities. The explanation lies in the socioeconomic conditions of the country. Venezuela did not offer then to the colonizers the immense riches kept by nature for later times. The simplification of technical problems, the renunciation of most of the decorative elements and variegated ostentations of fanciful baroque, the impossibility of using expensive materials and the consequent lack of craftsmen, contributed to establish a modest but well-defined physiognomy of the colonial architecture of Venezuela. During the colonial period, there were eventually confrontations between the Spanish conquerors and the barbarians and pirates that sailed along the Venezuelan coasts, in order to take over the provinces located on the coasts of the country. Christian temples from the colonial era were constituted by an almost invariable, arrangement consisting of a rectangular plan, three naves separated by arches of alfarje roofing composed of religious architecture in colonial times. The Venezuelan society dedicated a great amount of resources to erect religious monuments comparable to those of other countries of the continent. The XVII century was of reconstruction of the Catholic churches that had been destroyed by the earthquake of 1641. In the 18th century, specifically between 1728 and 1785, the prosperity that Venezuela enjoyed due to the opening of the Compa√±√≠a Guipuzcoana de Caracas[381] was also reflected in the construction of new architecture, especially of a religious nature. Venezuelan art was initially dominated by religious motifs. However, in the late 19th century, artists began emphasizing historical and heroic representations of the country's struggle for independence.[382][383] This move was led by Mart√≠n Tovar y Tovar.[383][384] Modernism took over in the 20th century.[384] Notable Venezuelan artists include Arturo Michelena, Crist√≥bal Rojas, Armando Rever√≥n, Manuel Cabr√©; the kinetic artists Jes√∫s Soto, Gego and Carlos Cruz-Diez;[384] and contemporary artists such as Marisol and Yucef Merhi.[385][386] Venezuelan literature originated soon after the Spanish conquest of the mostly pre-literate Indigenous societies.[387] It was originally dominated by Spanish influences. Following the rise of political literature during the Venezuelan War of Independence, Venezuelan Romanticism, notably expounded by Juan Vicente Gonz√°lez, emerged as the first important genre in the region. Although mainly focused on narrative writing, Venezuelan literature was advanced by poets such as Andr√©s Eloy Blanco and Ferm√≠n Toro. Major writers and novelists include R√≥mulo Gallegos, Teresa de la Parra, Arturo Uslar Pietri, Adriano Gonz√°lez Le√≥n, Miguel Otero Silva, and Mariano Pic√≥n Salas. The great poet and humanist Andr√©s Bello was also an educator and intellectual (He was also a childhood tutor and mentor of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var). Others, such as Laureano Vallenilla Lanz and Jos√© Gil Fortoul, contributed to Venezuelan Positivism. The Indigenous musical styles of Venezuela are exemplified by groups like Un Solo Pueblo and Serenata Guayanesa. The national musical instrument is the cuatro. Traditional musical styles and songs mainly emerged in and around the llanos region, including \"Alma llanera\" (by Pedro El√≠as Guti√©rrez and Rafael Bol√≠var Coronado), \"Florentino y el diablo\" (by Alberto Arvelo Torrealba), \"Concierto en la llanura\" by Juan Vicente Torrealba, and \"Caballo viejo\" (by Sim√≥n D√≠az). The Zulian gaita is also a very popular genre, generally performed during Christmas. The national dance is the joropo.[388] Venezuela has always been a melting pot of cultures and this can be seen in the richness and variety of its musical styles and dances: calipso, bambuco, ful√≠a, cantos de pilado de ma√≠z, cantos de lavanderas, sebuc√°n, and maremare.[389] Teresa Carre√±o was a world-famous 19th century piano virtuoso. Recently, great classical music performances have come out of Venezuela. The Sim√≥n Bol√≠var Youth Orchestra has hosted a number of excellent concerts in many European concert halls, most notably at the 2007 London Proms, and has received several honors. The orchestra is the pinnacle of El Sistema, a publicly financed, voluntary music education program now being emulated in other countries. In the early 21st century, a movement known as \"Movida Ac√∫stica Urbana\" featured musicians trying to save some national traditions, creating their own original songs but using traditional instruments.[390][391] Some groups following this movement are Tambor Urbano,[392] Los Sinverguenzas, C4Tr√≠o, and Orozco Jam.[393] Afro-Venezuelan musical traditions are most intimately related to the festivals of the \"black folk saints\" San Juan and St. Benedict the Moor. Specific songs are related to the different stages of their festivals and processions, when the saints start their yearly \"paseo\" ‚Äì stroll ‚Äì through the community. The origins of baseball in Venezuela are unclear, although it is known that the sport was being played in the country by the late 19th century.[394] In the early 20th century, North American immigrants who came to Venezuela to work in the nation's oil industry helped to popularize the sport in Venezuela.[395] During the 1930s, baseball's popularity continued to rise in the country, leading to the foundation of the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League (LVBP) in 1945, and the sport would soon become the nation's most popular.[396][397] The popularity of baseball in the country makes Venezuela a rarity among its South American neighbors‚Äîassociation football is the dominant sport in the continent.[395][397][398] However, football, as well as basketball, are among the more popular sports played in Venezuela.[399] Venezuela hosted the 2012 Basketball World Olympic Qualifying Tournament and the 2013 FIBA Basketball Americas Championship, which took place in the Poliedro de Caracas. Although not as popular in Venezuela as the rest of South America, football, spearheaded by the Venezuela national football team is gaining popularity as well. The sport is also noted for having an increased focus during the World Cup.[399] Venezuela is scheduled to host the Copa Am√©rica every 40 years.[400] Venezuela is also home to former Formula 1 driver, Pastor Maldonado.[401] Maldonado has increased the reception of Formula 1 in Venezuela, helping to popularize the sport in the country.[402] In the 2012 Summer Olympics, Rub√©n Limardo won a gold medal in fencing.[403] In the Winter Sports, Cesar Baena had represented the country since 2008 in Nordic Skiing, the first South American skier to compete in a FIS Cross Country Ski World Cup on D√ºsseldorf 2009. Los resultados arrojados por el censo poblacional realizado por el Instituto Nacional de Estad√≠sticas en el 2011 demuestra que las poblaciones ind√≠genas ha aumentado progresivamente con respecto al censo del a√±o 2001. Seg√∫n los datos estad√≠sticos publicados por el INE, el total de poblaci√≥n que se declar√≥ ind√≠gena por sexo, arroj√≥ un resultado de 50,46% hombre y 49,54% mujeres representando 365.920 hombres y 359.208 mujeres para un total de 725.148 personas que se declararon ind√≠genas de Venezuela.

                "content": "Two conservative justices join three liberal members in a 5-4 decision to clear the way for the sentencing. US President-elect Donald Trump is set to be sentenced by a New York court for covering up hush money payments to a porn star, after the Supreme Court rejected his last-ditch bid to delay the process that would make him the first convicted felon in the White House. The highest US court cleared Trump‚Äôs sentencing on Friday, with two conservative justices joining the three liberal members in a 5-4 decision issued late on Thursday. The sentencing, which Trump is expected to attend online, will happen in the Manhattan courtroom just 10 days before his inauguration for his second term as president. Chief Justice John Roberts and fellow conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined the court‚Äôs three liberal justices ‚Äì Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson ‚Äì in forming a majority to deny Trump‚Äôs request. Four conservative justices dissented from the decision, noting they would have granted Trump‚Äôs request. They did not provide their reasoning. The court‚Äôs brief, unsigned order gave two reasons for the decision. The court said the ‚Äúalleged evidentiary violations‚Äù at Trump‚Äôs state-court trial ‚Äúcan be addressed in the ordinary course on appeal‚Äù. It also said that ‚Äúthe burden that sentencing will impose‚Äù on Trump‚Äôs responsibilities ‚Äúis relatively insubstantial in light of the trial court‚Äôs stated intent to impose a sentence of ‚Äòunconditional discharge‚Äô after a brief virtual hearing‚Äù. Trump said in remarks at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida after the Supreme Court‚Äôs order: ‚ÄúI read it, and I thought was a fair decision, actually.‚Äù Trump added on his social media platform: ‚ÄúFor the sake and sanctity of the Presidency, I will be appealing this case, and am confident that JUSTICE WILL PREVAIL.‚Äù Trump was found guilty by a jury last May of 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up a $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels in exchange for her silence shortly before the 2016 US election about a sexual encounter, which she said she had with Trump a decade earlier. Prosecutors have said the payment was designed to help Trump‚Äôs chances in the 2016 election, when he defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump is the first former US president to be criminally prosecuted and the first former president convicted of a crime. Trump has denied any wrongdoing. The trial judge, Justice Juan Merchan, said last week he was not inclined to sentence Trump to prison and would likely grant him unconditional discharge. This would place a guilty judgement on Trump‚Äôs record, but would not impose custody, a fine or probation. Merchan is set to sentence Trump at 9:30am (14:30 GMT) on Friday.

                "content": "NEW YORK (AP) ‚Äî In a singular moment in U.S. history, President-elect Donald Trump faces sentencing Friday for his New York hush money conviction after the nation‚Äôs highest court refused to intervene. Like so much else in the criminal case and the current American political landscape, the scenario set to unfold in an austere Manhattan courtroom was unimaginable only a few years ago. A state judge is to say what consequences, if any, the country‚Äôs former and soon-to-be leader will face for felonies that a jury found he committed. With Trump 10 days from inauguration, Judge Juan M. Merchan has indicated he plans a no-penalty sentence called an unconditional discharge, and prosecutors aren‚Äôt opposing it. That would mean no jail time, no probation and no fines would be imposed, but nothing is final until Friday‚Äôs proceeding is done. Regardless of the outcome, Trump, a Republican, will become the first person convicted of a felony to assume the presidency. Trump, who is expected to appear by video from his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, will have the opportunity to speak. He has pilloried the case, the only one of his four criminal indictments that has gone to trial and possibly the only one that ever will. The judge has indicated that he plans the unconditional discharge ‚Äî a rarity in felony convictions ‚Äî partly to avoid complicated constitutional issues that would arise if he imposed a penalty that overlapped with Trump‚Äôs presidency. The hush money case accused Trump of fudging his business' records to veil a $130,000 payoff to porn actor Stormy Daniels. She was paid, late in Trump‚Äôs 2016 campaign, not to tell the public about a sexual encounter she maintains the two had a decade earlier. He says nothing sexual happened between them, and he contends that his political adversaries spun up a bogus prosecution to try to damage him. ‚ÄúI never falsified business records. It is a fake, made up charge,‚Äù the Republican president-elect wrote on his Truth Social platform last week. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, whose office brought the charges, is a Democrat. Bragg‚Äôs office said in a court filing Monday that Trump committed ‚Äúserious offenses that caused extensive harm to the sanctity of the electoral process and to the integrity of New York‚Äôs financial marketplace.‚Äù While the specific charges were about checks and ledgers, the underlying accusations were seamy and deeply entangled with Trump‚Äôs political rise. Prosecutors said Daniels was paid off ‚Äî through Trump‚Äôs personal attorney at the time, Michael Cohen ‚Äî as part of a wider effort to keep voters from hearing about Trump‚Äôs alleged extramarital escapades. Trump denies the alleged encounters occurred. His lawyers said he wanted to squelch the stories to protect his family, not his campaign. And while prosecutors said Cohen‚Äôs reimbursements for paying Daniels were deceptively logged as legal expenses, Trump says that‚Äôs simply what they were. ‚ÄúThere was nothing else it could have been called,‚Äù he wrote on Truth Social last week, adding, ‚ÄúI was hiding nothing.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs lawyers tried unsuccessfully to forestall a trial. Since his May conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records, they have pulled virtually every legal lever within reach to try to get the conviction overturned, the case dismissed or at least the sentencing postponed. They have made various arguments to Merchan, New York appeals judges, and federal courts including the Supreme Court. The Trump attorneys have leaned heavily into assertions of presidential immunity from prosecution, and they got a boost in July from a Supreme Court decision that affords former commanders-in-chief considerable immunity. Trump was a private citizen and presidential candidate when Daniels was paid in 2016. He was president when the reimbursements to Cohen were made and recorded the following year. On one hand, Trump‚Äôs defense argued that immunity should have kept jurors from hearing some evidence, such as testimony about some of his conversations with then-White House communications director Hope Hicks. And after Trump won this past November‚Äôs election, his lawyers argued that the case had to be scrapped to avoid impinging on his upcoming presidency and his transition to the Oval Office. Merchan, a Democrat, repeatedly postponed the sentencing, initially set for July. But last week, he set Friday‚Äôs date, citing a need for ‚Äúfinality.‚Äù He wrote that he strove to balance Trump‚Äôs need to govern, the Supreme Court‚Äôs immunity ruling, the respect due a jury verdict and the public‚Äôs expectation that ‚Äúno one is above the law.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs lawyers then launched a flurry of last-minute efforts to block the sentencing. Their last hope vanished Thursday night with a 5-4 Supreme Court ruling that declined to delay the sentencing. Meanwhile, the other criminal cases that once loomed over Trump have ended or stalled ahead of trial. After Trump‚Äôs election, special counsel Jack Smith closed out the federal prosecutions over Trump‚Äôs handling of classified documents and his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. A state-level Georgia election interference case is locked in uncertainty after prosecutorFaniWillis was removed from it. ___ Follow the AP‚Äôs coverage of President-elect Donald Trump at https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump.

                "content": "The Football Association Challenge Cup, more commonly known as the FA Cup, is an annual knockout football competition in domestic English football. First played during the 1871‚Äì72 season, it is the oldest national football competition in the world.[1] It is organised by and named after The Football Association (The FA). A concurrent Women's FA Cup has been held since 1970. The competition is open to all eligible clubs down to level 9 of the English football league system, with level 10 clubs acting as stand-ins in the event of non-entries from above.[2] A record 763 clubs competed in 2011‚Äì12. The tournament consists of 12 randomly drawn rounds followed by the semi-finals and the final. Entrants are not seeded, although a system of byes based on league level ensures higher ranked teams enter in later rounds ‚Äì the minimum number of games needed to win, depending on which round a team enters the competition, ranges from six to fourteen. The first six rounds are the Qualifying Competition, and are contested by clubs in the National League System, levels 5 to 10 of the English football system, more commonly called non-League. 32 of these teams progress to the first round of the Competition Proper, meeting the first of the 48 professional teams from Leagues One and Two. The last entrants are the 20 Premier League and 24 Championship clubs, into the draw for the third round proper.[2] In the modern era, only one non-League team has ever reached the quarter-finals, and teams below Level 2 have never reached the final.[note 1] As a result, significant focus is given to the smaller teams who progress furthest, especially if they achieve an unlikely \"giant-killing\" victory. Winners receive the FA Cup trophy, of which there have been two designs and five actual cups; the latest is a 2014 replica of the second design, introduced in 1911. Winners also qualify for the UEFA Europa League and a place in the upcoming FA Community Shield. Arsenal are the most successful club with fourteen titles, most recently in 2020, and their former manager Ars√®ne Wenger is the competition's most successful, having won seven finals with the team. Manchester United are the current holders, having defeated local rivals Manchester City 2‚Äì1 in the 2024 final. In 1863, the newly founded Football Association (the FA) published the Laws of the Game of Association Football, unifying the various different rules in use before then. On 20 July 1871, in the offices of The Sportsman newspaper, the FA Secretary C. W. Alcock proposed to the FA committee that \"it is desirable that a Challenge Cup should be established in connection with the Association for which all clubs belonging to the Association should be invited to compete\". The inaugural FA Cup tournament kicked off in November 1871. After thirteen games in all, Wanderers were crowned the winners in the final, on 16 March 1872. Wanderers retained the trophy the following year. The modern cup was beginning to be established by the 1888‚Äì89 season, when qualifying rounds were introduced.[3] Following the 1914‚Äì15 edition, the competition was suspended in mid air due to the First World War, and did not resume until 1919‚Äì20. The 1923 FA Cup Final, commonly known as the \"White Horse Final\", was the first final to be played in the newly opened Wembley Stadium (known at the time as the Empire Stadium). The 1927 final saw \"Abide with Me\" being sung for the first time at the Cup final, which has become a pre-match tradition.[4] Due to the outbreak of World War II, the competition was not played between the 1938‚Äì39 and 1945‚Äì46 editions. Due to the wartime breaks, the competition did not celebrate its centenary year until 1980‚Äì81. After some confusion over the rules in its first competition, the FA decided that any drawn match would lead to a replay, with teams competing in further replays until a game was eventually won.[5] Alvechurch and Oxford City contested the most replayed tie in the 1971‚Äì72 qualification, in a tie which went to 6 matches.[5] Multiple replays were scrapped for the competition proper in 1991‚Äì92, and the qualifying rounds in 1997‚Äì98.[5] Replays were removed altogether from the semi-final and final matches in 2000, from the quarter-finals in 2016‚Äì17, the fifth round in 2019‚Äì20[5] and the first round onwards from 2024 to 2025.[6] Redevelopment of Wembley saw the final played outside of England for the first time, the 2001‚Äì2006 finals being played at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. The final returned to Wembley in 2007, followed by the semi-finals from 2008. An application window is open to clubs before entry lists, round byes and scheduling are announced in July. All clubs in the top four levels (the Premier League and the three divisions of the English Football League) are automatically eligible. Clubs from Level 5‚Äì9 (non-league football) are also eligible provided they play in either the FA Trophy or FA Vase competitions in the current season. All participating clubs must also have a stadium suitable for the competition and The Association may reject applications at its discretion.[2] Previously, Level 10 clubs were a prominent feature in early qualifying rounds. The gradual remodelling of the National League System to a 'perfect' 1‚Äì2‚Äì4‚Äì8‚Äì16 system, with a first phase in 2018‚Äì19, a final phase in 2021‚Äì22 (which included the promotion of 107 clubs), and played to a full quota in 2022‚Äì23 has resulted in a larger number of teams playing in Level 7‚Äì9.[7][8][9] Consequently, for the FA Cup, entries equal the number in tiers 1‚Äì9 and is cut off to those below.[2] Though still able to apply, Level 10 clubs are used as alternatives \"subject to availability\" in the event of a non/rejected applicant (with vacancies filled by Level 10 applicants with the best PPG in the previous league season).[2] The total number of entries in the FA Cup has changed as Non-League football has gradually been expanded and reorganised over time. In the 2004‚Äì05 season, 660 clubs entered the competition, beating the long-standing record of 656 from the 1921‚Äì22 season. In 2005‚Äì06 this increased to 674 entrants, in 2006‚Äì07 to 687, in 2007‚Äì08 to 731 clubs, in 2008‚Äì09 and 2009‚Äì10 to 762.[10] The total number of entries has also varied naturally from year-to-year as new clubs form and others dissolve at unequal rates. Though most leagues in the National League System maintain the same number of teams via reprieves, inevitably entry-level divisions (typically at tier 10) have to be impacted when a club leaves the pyramid.[11] Therefore, for example, 759 teams entered in 2010‚Äì11, a record 763 in 2011‚Äì12, 758 in 2012‚Äì13, 737 in 2013‚Äì14 and 736 in 2014‚Äì15.[10] However, since 2021‚Äì22, The FA has cut off automatic eligibility to the 10th tier (to appear only subject to availability) and instead set the size of the draw to match the more stable number of teams in Level 1‚Äì9.[12] This means that the competition may now see a standardised number of entries from one year to the next.[13] This number is currently 732 but could rise to 748 for 2023‚Äì24 with plans for a new SWPL 9th tier division to share the South West with the existing Western League.[14] It is very rare for top clubs to miss the competition, although it can happen in exceptional circumstances. Manchester United did not defend their title in 1999‚Äì2000, as they were already in the inaugural Club World Championship. The club stated that entering both tournaments would overload their fixture schedule and make it more difficult to defend their Champions League and Premier League titles. The club claimed that they did not want to devalue the FA Cup by fielding a weaker side. The move benefited United as they received a two-week break and won the 1999‚Äì2000 league title by an 18-point margin, although they did not progress past the group stage of the Club World Championship. The withdrawal from the FA Cup, however, drew considerable criticism as this weakened the tournament's prestige and Sir Alex Ferguson later admitted his regret regarding their handling of the situation.[15][16][17] Welsh sides that play in English leagues are eligible, although since the creation of the League of Wales there are only five clubs remaining: Cardiff City (the only non-English team to win the tournament, in 1927), Swansea City, Newport County, Wrexham, and Merthyr Town. In the early years other teams from Wales, Ireland and Scotland also took part in the competition, with Glasgow side Queen's Park losing the final to Blackburn Rovers in 1884 and 1885 before being barred from entering by the Scottish Football Association. Entries from clubs affiliated to \"offshore\" associations are also eligible subject to consideration on an annual basis, with special provisions that may apply.[2] In the 2013‚Äì14 season the first Channel Island club entered the competition when Guernsey F.C. competed.[18] The first game played in the Channel Islands ‚Äì and thus the southernmost FA Cup tie played ‚Äì took place on 7 August 2021 between Jersey Bulls and Horsham YMCA. A third club, F.C. Isle of Man, was also eligible to play in 2022‚Äì23, but in the end all Crown Dependency teams either did not appear on the entry list or later withdrew.[19][20] Beginning in August, the competition proceeds as a knockout tournament throughout, consisting of twelve rounds, a semi-final and then a final, in May. A system of byes ensures clubs above level 9 enter the competition at later stages. There is no seeding, the fixtures in each round being determined by a random draw. Fixtures ending in a tie are replayed once only (from the 2024‚Äì25 campaign, prior to the first round proper).[21][22] The first six rounds are qualifiers, with the draws organised on a regional basis. The next six rounds are the \"proper\" rounds where all clubs are in one draw. All entrants from Level 9 begin the competition in the extra preliminary round, as well as any Level 10 team filling in for a vacancy.[2] Teams from Level 8 are ranked on their PPG in the previous season, except newly promoted teams automatically ranked towards the bottom and newly relegated teams ranked to the top; teams are then split between entering at either the Extra-Preliminary or preliminary round so as to ensure the right balance of fixtures throughout the competition.[2] From there, clubs from higher levels are added in later rounds, as per the table below. The months in which rounds are played are traditional, with exact dates subject to each calendar. The number of new entries, winners from previous rounds, and division of Level 8 teams in the two preliminary rounds are based on an entry list of 732 modelled on the English league system as of 2022‚Äì23. From 2023 to 2024, the entry list could rise to 746 in line with sixteen additional clubs at Level 9 meaning that the extra preliminary round will have 444 teams with only 50 Level 8 clubs entering at the preliminary round.[14] previous round Level 9 clubs Level 8 clubs (96 lowest ranked) The qualifying rounds are regionalised to reduce the travel costs for smaller non-league sides. The first and second proper rounds were also previously split into Northern and Southern sections, but this practice was ended after the 1997‚Äì98 competition. [citation needed] The final is normally held the Saturday after the Premier League season finishes in May. The only seasons in recent times when this pattern was not followed were: 1999‚Äì2000, when most rounds were played a few weeks earlier than normal as an experiment; 2010‚Äì11 and 2012‚Äì13 when the FA Cup Final was played before the Premier League season had finished, to allow Wembley Stadium to be ready for the UEFA Champions League final,[23] as well as in 2011‚Äì12 to allow England time to prepare for that summer's European Championships;[24] 2019‚Äì20 when the final was delayed until August due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom,[25][26] and the 2021-22 when the final was held a week before the end of the league. The 2025 Final is also scheduled to take place the week before the end of the league.[27] The draws for the Extra Preliminary, Preliminary, and first qualifying rounds used to all occur at the same time. Thereafter, the draw for each subsequent round is not made until after the scheduled dates for the previous round, meaning that in the case of replays, clubs will often know their future opponents in advance. The draw for each of the proper rounds is broadcast live on television, usually taking place at the conclusion of live coverage of one of the games of the previous round. Public interest is particularly high during the draw for the third round, which is where the top-ranked teams are added to the draw. In rounds up to and including the fourth round proper, fixtures resulting in a draw (after normal time) go to a replay, played at the venue of the away team, at a later date; if that replay is still tied, the winner is settled by a period of extra time, and if still necessary, a penalty shootout. Since 2016‚Äì17, ties have been settled on the day from the quarter-finals onwards, using extra time and penalties. From 2018‚Äì19, Fifth round ties are also settled by extra time and penalties. Beginning with the 2024‚Äì25 competition, replays have been scrapped from the first round onwards.[28] The decision to scrap replays received criticism from a number of lower-tier clubs and government officials.[29] Until 1990‚Äì91, further replays would be played until one team was victorious. In 1971‚Äì72, a fourth qualifying round game between Alvechurch and Oxford City was played six times until Alvechurch won in the fifth replay.[30] In their 1975 campaign, Fulham played 12 games over six rounds, which remains the most games played by a team to reach a final.[31] Replays were traditionally played three or four days after the original game, but from 1991‚Äì92 they were staged at least 10 days later on police advice for the rounds proper. This led to penalty shoot-outs being introduced, the first of which came on 26 November 1991 when Rotherham United eliminated Scunthorpe United.[32] From 1980‚Äì81 to 1998‚Äì99, the semi-finals went to extra time on the day if the score after 90 minutes was a draw. If the score was still level after extra time, the match would go to a replay. Replays for the semi-finals were scrapped for 1999‚Äì2000; the last semi-final to go into a replay was in 1998‚Äì99, when Manchester United beat rivals Arsenal 2‚Äì1 after extra time, following a 0‚Äì0 draw in the original match. The first FA Cup Final to go to extra time and a replay was the 1875 final, between the Royal Engineers and the Old Etonians. The initial tie finished 1‚Äì1 but the Royal Engineers won the replay 2‚Äì0 in normal time. The last replayed final was the 1993 FA Cup Final, when Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday fought a 1‚Äì1 draw. The replay saw Arsenal win the FA Cup, 2‚Äì1 after extra time. The last quarter-final to go to a replay was Manchester United vs West Ham United in the 2015‚Äì16 FA Cup. The original game at Old Trafford ended in a 1‚Äì1 draw, while Manchester United won the replay at the Boleyn Ground, 2‚Äì1. It was also the last FA Cup game ever played at the Boleyn Ground.[33] The last fifth round replay saw Tottenham Hotspur defeat Rochdale 6‚Äì1 at Wembley in the 2017‚Äì18 FA Cup after the first match at Spotland Stadium ended in a 2‚Äì2 draw.[34] The FA Cup winners qualify for the following season's UEFA Europa League (formerly named the UEFA Cup; from its launch in 1960 until 1998, they entered the now-defunct UEFA Cup Winners' Cup instead). This European place applies even if the team is relegated or is not in the English top flight. In the past, if the FA Cup winning team also qualified for the following season's Champions League or Europa League through their league or European performance, then the losing FA Cup finalists were given the European berth of the League Cup winners and the League Cup winners would be given the league berth instead (in the Cup Winners' Cup era, teams qualifying for the UEFA Cup via other competitions would be promoted to the Cup Winners' Cup instead). FA Cup winners enter the Europa League at the group stage. Losing finalists, if they had not qualified for Europe via the league, began earlier, at the play-off or third qualifying round stage.[35] From the 2015‚Äì16 UEFA Europa League season, however, UEFA does not allow the runners-up to qualify for the Europa League through the competition.[36] If the winner of the FA Cup has already qualified for a European Competition through their Premier League position, the FA Cup berth is then given to the highest placed team in the Premier League who has not yet qualified for a European Competition. The FA Cup winners also qualify for the following season's single-match FA Community Shield, the traditional season opener played against the previous season's Premier League champions (or the Premier League runners-up if the FA Cup winners also won the league ‚Äì the double). Fixtures in the 12 rounds of the competition are usually played at the home ground of one of the two teams. The semi-finals and final are played at a neutral venue ‚Äì the rebuilt Wembley Stadium. In the matches for the 12 competition rounds, the team who plays at home is decided when the fixtures are drawn ‚Äì simply the first team drawn out for each fixture. Occasionally games may have to be moved to other grounds due to other events taking place, security reasons or a ground not being suitable to host popular teams. However, since 2003, clubs cannot move grounds to the away side's for capacity or financial reasons. If any move has to be made, it has to be to a neutral venue and any additional monies earned by the move goes into the central pot.[37] In the event of a draw, the replay is played at the ground of the team who originally played away from home. In the days when multiple replays were possible, the second replay (and any further replays) were played at neutral grounds. The clubs involved could alternatively agree to toss for home advantage in the second replay. The semi-finals have been played exclusively at the rebuilt Wembley Stadium since 2008, one year after it opened and after it had already hosted a final (in 2007). For the first decade of the competition, the Kennington Oval was used as the semi-final venue. In the period between this first decade and the reopening of Wembley, semi-finals were played at high-capacity neutral venues around England; usually the home grounds of teams not involved in that semi-final, chosen to be roughly equidistant between the two teams for fairness of travel. The top three most used venues in this period were Villa Park in Birmingham (55 times), Hillsborough in Sheffield (34 times) and Old Trafford in Manchester (23 times). The original Wembley Stadium was also used seven times for semi-final, between 1991 and 2000 (the last held there), but not always for fixtures featuring London teams. In 2005, both were held at the Millennium Stadium. In 2003 the FA decided to permanently use the new Wembley for semi-finals to recoup debts in financing the new stadium.[38] This was controversial, with the move seen as both unfair to fans of teams located far from London, as well as taking some of the prestige away from a Wembley final.[39] In defending the move, the FA has also cited the extra capacity Wembley offers, although the 2013 fixture between Millwall and Wigan Athletic led to the unprecedented step of placing 6,000 tickets on sale to neutral fans after the game failed to sell out.[40] A fan poll by The Guardian in 2013 found 86% opposition to Wembley semi-finals.[40] The final has been played at the rebuilt Wembley Stadium since it opened, in 2007.[41] The rebuilding process meant that between 2001 and 2006 they were hosted at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff in Wales. Prior to rebuilding, the final was hosted by the original Wembley Stadium since it opened in 1923 (being originally named the Empire Stadium). One exception to this 78-year series of Empire Stadium finals (including five replays) was the 1970 replay between Leeds United and Chelsea, held at Old Trafford in Manchester. In the 51 years prior to the Empire Stadium opening, the final (including 8 replays) was held in a variety of locations, predominantly in London, and mainly at the Kennington Oval and then Crystal Palace. It was played 22 times at The Oval (the inaugural competition in 1872, and then all but two times until 1892). After The Oval, Crystal Palace hosted 21 finals from 1895 to 1914, broken up by four replays elsewhere. The other London venues were Stamford Bridge from 1920 to 1922 (the last three finals before the move to Empire Stadium); and the University of Oxford's Lillie Bridge in Fulham for the second ever final, in 1873. The other venues used sparingly in this period were all outside of London, as follows: The FA permitted artificial turf (3G) pitches in all rounds of the competition from the 2014‚Äì15 edition and beyond.[42] Under the 2015‚Äì16 rules, the pitch must be of FIFA One Star quality, or Two Star for ties if they involve one of the 92 professional clubs.[2] This followed approval two years previously for their use in the qualifying rounds only ‚Äì if a team with a 3G pitch progressed to the competition proper, they had to switch their tie to the ground of another eligible entrant with a natural grass pitch.[43] Having been strong proponents of the surface, the first match in the proper rounds to be played on a 3G surface was a televised first round replay at Maidstone United's Gallagher Stadium on 20 November 2014.[44] The winners of the competition receive the FA Cup. It is only loaned to the club by the FA; under the current (2015‚Äì16) rules it must be returned by 1 March, or earlier if given seven days' notice.[2] Traditionally, the holders had the Cup until the following year's presentation, although more recently the trophy has been taken on publicity tours by the FA in between finals.[45] The trophy comes in three parts ‚Äì the cup itself, plus a lid and a base. There have been two designs of trophy in use, but five physical trophies have been presented. The original trophy, known as the \"little tin idol\", was 18 inches high and made by Martin, Hall & Co. It was stolen in 1895 and never recovered, and so was replaced by an exact replica, used until 1910. The FA decided to change the design after the 1909 winners, Manchester United, made their own replica, leading the FA to realise they did not own the copyright.[46] This new, larger design was by Fattorini and Sons, and was used from 1911.[46] In order to preserve this original, from 1992 it was replaced by an exact replica, although this had to be replaced after just over two decades, after showing wear and tear from being handled more than in previous eras. This third replica, first used in 2014, was built heavier to withstand the increased handling.[45] Of the four surviving trophies, only the 1895 replica has entered private ownership.[47] The name of the winning team is engraved on the silver band around the base as soon as the final has finished, in order to be ready in time for the presentation ceremony.[45] This means the engraver has just five minutes to perform a task which would take 20 under normal conditions, although time is saved by engraving the year on during the match, and sketching the presumed winner.[48] During the final, the trophy is decorated with ribbons in the colours of both finalists, with the loser's ribbons being removed at the end of the game.[49] The tradition of tying ribbons started after Tottenham Hotspur won the 1901 FA Cup Final and the wife of a Spurs director decided to tie blue and white ribbons to the handles of the cup.[50] Traditionally, at Wembley finals, the presentation is made at the Royal Box, with players, led by the captain, mounting a staircase to a gangway in front of the box and returning by a second staircase on the other side of the box. At Cardiff the presentation was made on a podium on the pitch. The tradition of presenting the trophy immediately after the game did not start until the 1882 final; after the first final in 1872 the trophy was not presented to the winners, Wanderers, until a reception held four weeks later in the Pall Mall Restaurant in London.[51] Under the original rules, the trophy was to be permanently presented to any club which won the competition three times, although when inaugural winners Wanderers achieved this feat by the 1876 final, the rules were changed by FA Secretary CW Alcock (who was also captain of Wanderers in their first victory).[52] Portsmouth have the distinction of being the football club which has held the FA Cup trophy for the longest uninterrupted period - seven years. Portsmouth had defeated Wolverhampton Wanderers 4‚Äì1 in the 1939 FA Cup Final and were awarded the trophy as 1938‚Äì39 FA Cup winners. But with the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, the regular Football League and FA Cup competitions for the 1939‚Äì40 season were cancelled for the duration of the war. Portsmouth's manager Jack Tinn was rumoured to have kept the FA Cup trophy 'safe under his bed' throughout the duration of the war, but this is an urban myth. Because the naval city of Portsmouth was a primary strategic military target for German Luftwaffe bombing, the FA Cup trophy was actually taken ten miles to the north of Portsmouth, to the nearby Hampshire village of Lovedean, and there it resided in a quaint thatched roof country pub called The Bird in Hand for the seven years of the war.[53] After the conclusion of World War II, the FA Cup trophy was presented back to the Football Association by the club in time for the 1946 FA Cup Final. The first trophy, the 'little tin idol', was made by Martin, Hall & Co at a cost of ¬£20.[54] It was stolen from a Birmingham shoe shop window belonging to William Shillcock while held by Aston Villa on 11 September 1895 and was never seen again. Despite a ¬£10 reward for information, the crime was never solved. As it happened while it was in their care, the FA fined Villa ¬£25 to pay for a replacement. Just over 60 years later, 80 year old career criminal Henry (Harry) James Burge claimed to have committed the theft, confessing to a newspaper, with the story being published in the Sunday Pictorial newspaper on 23 February 1958. He claimed to have carried out the robbery with two other men, although when discrepancies with a contemporaneous report in the Birmingham Post newspaper (the crime pre-dated written police reports) in his account of the means of entry and other items stolen, detectives decided there was no realistic possibility of a conviction and the case was closed. Burge claimed the cup had been melted down to make counterfeit half-crown coins, which matched known intelligence of the time, in which stolen silver was being used to forge coins which were then laundered through betting shops at a local racecourse, although Burge had no history of forgery in a record of 42 previous convictions for which he had spent 42 years in prison. He had been further imprisoned in 1957 for seven years for theft from cars. Released in 1961, he died in 1964.[55] After the theft, a replica of the trophy was made, which was used until a redesign of the trophy in 1911. The 1895 replica was then presented to the FA's long-serving president Lord Kinnaird.[46] Kinnaird died in 1923, and his family kept it in their possession, out of view, until putting it up for auction in 2005.[56] It was sold at Christie's auction house on 19 May 2005 for ¬£420,000 (¬£478,400 including auction fees and taxes).[46] The sale price set a new world record for a piece of football memorabilia, surpassing the ¬£254,000 paid for the Jules Rimet World Cup Trophy in 1997.[47] The successful bidder was David Gold, the then joint chairman of Birmingham City; claiming the FA and government were doing nothing proactive to ensure the trophy remained in the country, Gold stated his purchase was motivated by wanting to save it for the nation.[47] Accordingly, Gold presented the trophy to the National Football Museum in Preston on 20 April 2006, where it went on immediate public display.[56] It later moved with the museum to its new location in Manchester.[46] In November 2012, it was ceremonially presented to Royal Engineers, after they beat Wanderers 7‚Äì1 in a charity replay of the first FA Cup final. In September 2020, Gold sold the replica trophy for ¬£760,000 through the Bonhams auction house.[57] In January 2021, it was revealed that the trophy had been purchased by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the owner of Manchester City, who stated that it would be returned on loan to the National Football Museum.[58] The redesigned trophy first used in 1911 was larger at 61.5 cm (24.2 inches) high, and was designed and manufactured by Fattorini & Sons of Bradford, coincidentally being won by Bradford City in its first outing.[45][46] On the 27 March 2016 episode of the BBC television programme Antiques Roadshow, this trophy was valued at ¬£1 million by expert Alastair Dickenson, although he suggested that, due to the design featuring depictions of grapes and vines, it may not have been specifically produced for the FA, but was instead an off-the-shelf design originally meant to be a wine or champagne cooler.[46] This was later disproved when Thomas Fattorini was invited to the Antiques Roadshow to \"ambush\" Alastair Dickenson with the competition winning design by Fattorini & Sons. The show was filmed at Baddesley Clinton and subsequently aired on 23 October 2016. A smaller but otherwise identical replica was also made by the company Thomas Fattorini for the North Wales Coast FA Cup trophy which is contested annually by members of that regional Association.[59] The 1992 replica was made by Toye, Kenning and Spencer.[60] A copy of this trophy was also produced, in case anything happened to the primary trophy.[61] The 2014 replica was made by Thomas Lyte, handcrafted in sterling 925 silver over 250 hours. A weight increase for greater durability has taken it to 6.3 kilograms (14 lb).[45] Each club in the final receives 40 winners or runners-up medals to be distributed among players, staff and officials. The traditional styles of gold-cased medals ‚Äì the winners' medal, which had remained largely unchanged since the 1890s, and runners-up medals, which were last updated in 1946 ‚Äì were replaced for the 2021 final by new designs of gold winners' medals and silver runners-up medals suspended on a ribbon.[62] Since the start of the 1994‚Äì95 season, the FA Cup has been sponsored. However, to protect the identity of the competition, the sponsored name has always included 'The FA Cup' in addition to the sponsor's name, unlike sponsorship deals for the League Cup where the word 'cup' is preceded by only the sponsor's name. Sponsorship deals run for four years, though ‚Äì as in the case of E.ON ‚Äì one-year extensions may be agreed. Emirates Airline has been the sponsor since 2015, initially renaming the competition as 'The Emirates FA Cup', unlike previous editions, which included 'The FA Cup in association with E.ON' and 'The FA Cup with Budweiser'.[63] The Emirates sponsorship deal, originally scheduled to terminate in 2018, was later extended three times until 2021, 2024, 2028.[64] From 2006 to 2013, Umbro supplied match balls for all FA Cup matches. They were replaced at the start of the 2013‚Äì14 season by Nike, who produced the competition's official match ball for five seasons. Mitre took over for the 2018‚Äì19 season, beginning a three-year partnership with the FA.[71] The possibility of unlikely victories in the earlier rounds of the competition, where lower ranked teams beat higher placed opposition in what is known as a \"giant killing\", is much anticipated by the public. Such upsets are considered an integral part of the tradition and prestige of the competition, and the attention gained by giant-killing teams can be as great as that for winners of the cup.[79] Almost every club in the League Pyramid has a fondly remembered giant-killing act in its history.[80] It is considered particularly newsworthy when a top Premier League team suffers an upset defeat, or where the giant-killer is a non-league club, i.e. from outside The Football League. One analysis of four years of FA Cup results showed that it was 99.85 per cent likely that at least one team would beat one from its next higher division in a given year. The probability drops to 48.8 per cent for a two-division gap, and 39.28 per cent for a three-division gap.[80] The Football League was founded in 1888, 16 years after the first FA Cup competition. Before its establishment as the dominant football competition in England, teams from rival leagues did make the final of the FA Cup. The Wednesday (later Sheffield Wednesday) in 1890 reached the final as a member of the Football Alliance, two years before that competition merged with the Football League.[81] Later, with the Football League predominantly in the North and Midlands of England, leading clubs of the Southern Football League were of a level with Football League teams, and in 1901 Southern League members Tottenham Hotspur became the only non-League side to win the Cup,[82] while fellow Southern League team Southampton were losing finalists in 1900 and 1902. In 1920‚Äì21, the Football League expanded to incorporate teams from the Southern League's first division, and the following year it added a further division consisting of leading northern and midlands clubs. This consolidated the Football League's position as the leading competition in English football, and established the hierarchy in which non-League clubs in the English football league system competing in the FA Cup would face Football League teams as clear underdogs. Since the expansion of the Football League in 1921, the best performance of a team from outside the Football League was National League side Lincoln City's run to the quarter-finals of the 2016‚Äì17 FA Cup, during which they defeated Championship side Brighton 3‚Äì1 in the fourth round and Premier League side Burnley 1‚Äì0 in the fifth, before falling to ultimate Cup champions Arsenal 5‚Äì0 at the Emirates. Lincoln's defeat of Burnley was only the third (and most recent) FA Cup victory for a non-league team over a top-flight side since 1989.[83] Giant-killings can also be applied where the defeated team is from lower down the Football League, particularly where the defeated club is very notable or the winning team particularly obscure. Liverpool, having already won five league titles in their history, were in the Second Division in 1959 when they lost 2‚Äì1 to Worcester City of the Southern League.[84] The best-known non-league giant-killing came in the 1971‚Äì72 FA Cup, when non-league Hereford United defeated First Division Newcastle United.[85] Hereford were trailing 1‚Äì0 with less than seven minutes left in the Third round proper replay, when Hereford's Ronnie Radford scored the equaliser ‚Äì a goal still shown regularly when FA Cup fixtures are broadcast.[86] Hereford finished the shocking comeback by defeating Newcastle 2‚Äì1 in the match. They finished that season as runners-up of the Southern League, behind Chelmsford City, and were voted into the Football League at the expense of Barrow. Some small clubs gain a reputation for being \"cup specialists\" after two or more giant killing feats within a few years.[80] Yeovil Town hold the record for the most victories over league opposition as a non-league team, having recorded 20 wins through the years before they achieved promotion into The Football League in 2003.[87] The record for a club which has never entered the Football League is held by Altrincham, with 17 wins against league teams. For non-League teams, reaching the third round proper ‚Äì where all Level 1 sides now enter ‚Äì is considered a major achievement. In the 2008‚Äì09 FA Cup, a record eight non-League teams achieved this feat.[88] As of the 2023‚Äì24 season, only eleven non-League teams have reached the fifth round proper (last 16) since 1925,[89] and only Lincoln City have progressed to the quarter-finals (last 8), during the 2016‚Äì17 edition of the tournament.[90] Chasetown, while playing at Level 8 of English football during the 2007‚Äì08 competition, were the lowest-ranked team to ever play in the third round proper (final 64, of 731 teams entered that season). Chasetown was then a member of the Southern League Division One Midlands (a lower level within the Southern Football League), when they lost to Football League Championship (Level 2) team Cardiff City, the eventual FA Cup runners-up that year.[91] Their success earned the lowly organisation over ¬£60,000 in prize money. Marine matched this in the 2020‚Äì21 competition as a member of the Northern Premier League Division One North West, and were drawn against Premier League (Level 1) team Tottenham Hotspur, to whom they lost 5‚Äì0. During the 2023‚Äì24 season, Maidstone United in the National League South (Level 6) had an 8‚Äìgame cup run, reaching the fifth round when they won 2‚Äì1 away at EFL Championship (Level 2) side Ipswich Town.[92] Their run ended at the fifth round after losing 5‚Äì0 away to another EFL Championship side Coventry City.[93] They became the eleventh non‚ÄìLeague team to reach the fifth round, and the lowest-ranked team to do so since Blyth Spartans (Level 7) in 1977‚Äì78. Maidstone's co‚Äìowner Oliver Ash stated that their cup run had earned the club 'something like ¬£700,000 before tax'.[94] Giant-killings can apply to matches between league clubs, particularly where teams from tier 4 have defeated tier 1 sides. In games between League sides, one of the most notable results was the 1992 victory by Wrexham, bottom of the previous season's League (avoiding relegation due to expansion of The Football League), over reigning champions Arsenal. Another similar shock was when Shrewsbury Town beat Everton 2‚Äì1 in 2003. Everton finished seventh in the Premier League and Shrewsbury Town were relegated to the Football Conference that same season. During the 2022‚Äì23 tournament, Grimsby Town who were 16th in EFL League Two won 2‚Äì1 away at Premier League side Southampton to advance into the quarter finals.[95] Since its establishment, the FA Cup has been won by 44 clubs. Teams shown in italics are no longer in existence. Additionally, Queen's Park ceased to be eligible to enter the FA Cup after a Scottish Football Association ruling in 1887.[96] Four clubs have won consecutive FA Cups on more than one occasion: Wanderers (1872, 1873 and 1876, 1877, 1878), Blackburn Rovers (1884, 1885, 1886 and 1890, 1891), Tottenham Hotspur (1961, 1962 and 1981, 1982) and Arsenal (2002, 2003 and 2014, 2015). The record for most titles for a manager is held by Ars√®ne Wenger, who won the FA Cup with Arsenal seven times (1998, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2014, 2015, 2017). Wenger is also the only manager to have won the Cup at the old Wembley Stadium, the Millennium Stadium, and the new Wembley Stadium. Manchester City (2019) are the only club to have achieved a domestic treble of League, FA Cup and League Cup, having beaten Chelsea 4‚Äì3 on penalties in the League Cup Final, finished at the top of the Premier League, and beaten Watford 6‚Äì0 in the FA Cup Final. Manchester United (1999) and Manchester City (2023) are the only two English teams to have won the continental treble of League, FA Cup, and Champions League. They are two of only nine European sides to do so. Liverpool won the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup in (2001) to complete a cup treble. Eight clubs have won the FA Cup as part of a League and Cup double, namely Preston North End (1889), Aston Villa (1897), Tottenham Hotspur (1961), Arsenal (1971, 1998, 2002), Liverpool (1986), Manchester United (1994, 1996, 1999), Chelsea (2010) and Manchester City (2019, 2023). In 1993, Arsenal became the first side to win both the FA Cup and the League Cup in the same season when they beat Sheffield Wednesday in both finals. Liverpool (2001, 2022), Chelsea (2007) and Manchester City (2019) have since repeated this feat. In 2012, Chelsea won both the FA Cup and the Champions League. The FA Cup has only been won by a non-English team once. Cardiff City achieved this in 1927 when they beat Arsenal in the final at Wembley. They had previously made it to the final only to lose to Sheffield United in 1925 and lost another final to Portsmouth in 2008. Cardiff City are also the only team to win the national cups of two countries in the same season, having also won the Welsh Cup in 1927. The Scottish team Queen's Park reached and lost the final in both 1884 and 1885. Since the creation of the Football League in 1888, the final has never been contested by two teams from outside the top division, and there have only been eight winners who were not in the top flight: Notts County (1894); Tottenham Hotspur (1901); Wolverhampton Wanderers (1908); Barnsley (1912); West Bromwich Albion (1931); Sunderland (1973), Southampton (1976) and West Ham United (1980). With the exception of Tottenham, these clubs were all playing in the second tier (the old Second Division) ‚Äì Tottenham were playing in the Southern League and were only elected to the Football League in 1908, meaning they are the only non-League winners of the FA Cup since the League's creation. Other than Tottenham's victory, only 24 finalists have come from outside English football's top tier, with a record of 7 wins and 17 runners-up: and none at all from the third tier or lower, Southampton (1902, then in the Southern League) being the last finalist from outside the top two tiers. Sunderland's win in 1973 was considered a major upset, having beaten Leeds United who finished third in the top flight that season,[98] as was West Ham's victory over Arsenal in 1980 as the Gunners were in their third successive FA Cup Final and were the cup holders as well as just having finished 4th in the First Division, whereas West Ham had ended the season 7th in Division 2. This also marked the last time (as of 2023‚Äì24) a team from outside the top division won the FA Cup. Uniquely, in 2008 three of the four semi-finalists (Barnsley, Cardiff City and West Bromwich) were from outside the top division, although the eventual winner was the last remaining top-flight team, Portsmouth.[99] West Bromwich (1931) are the only team to have won the FA Cup and earned promotion to the top flight in the same season; whereas Wigan Athletic (2013) are the only team to have won the Cup and been relegated from the top flight in the same season. The FA Cup Final is one of 10 events reserved for live broadcast on UK terrestrial television under the Ofcom Code on Sports and Other Listed and Designated Events. In the early years of coverage the BBC had exclusive radio coverage with a picture of the pitch marked in the Radio Times with numbered squares to help the listener follow the match on the radio. The first FA Cup Final on Radio was in 1926 between Bolton Wanderers and Manchester City but this was only broadcast in Manchester, the first national final on BBC Radio was between Arsenal and Cardiff City in 1927. The first final on BBC Television was in 1937 in a match which featured Sunderland and Preston North End but this was not televised in full. The following season's final between Preston and Huddersfield Town was covered in full by the BBC. When ITV was formed in 1955 they shared final coverage with the BBC in one of the only club matches shown live on television, during the 1970s and 1980s coverage became more elaborate with BBC and ITV trying to steal viewers from the others by starting coverage earlier and earlier some starting as early as 9 a.m. which was six hours before kick off. The sharing of rights between BBC and ITV continued from 1955 to 1988, when ITV lost coverage to the BBC. From 1988 to 1997, the BBC was the exclusive broadcaster of the competition on terrestrial television and covered the competition from the third round onwards, showing one live match per round alongside highlights. In 1990, British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB) obtained rights to the competition, and showed a live match from rounds 1 and 2. This continued to be the case after Sky took over BSB in 1991. From 1997 to 2001, Sky owned the coverage showing one match per round, with the free-to-air rights sublicensed to ITV who showed an additional match from the third round onwards.[100]: 44 The BBC continued with highlights on Match of the Day. From 2001 to 2008, BBC and Sky again shared coverage with BBC having two or three matches per round and Sky having one or two. Until the 2008‚Äì09 season, the BBC and Sky Sports shared television coverage, with the BBC showing three matches in the earlier rounds. Some analysts argued the decision to move away from the Sky and, in particular, the BBC undermined the FA Cup in the eyes of the public. From 2008‚Äì09 to 2013‚Äì14, FA Cup matches were shown live by ITV across England and Wales, with UTV broadcasting to Northern Ireland. Scottish member STV refused to show them, and instead the regularly advertised programming that otherwise would mostly have been shown across the UK (new and repeated network entertainment and drama content, films, local productions etc.) would continue as normal in a delayed or exclusive fashion while the rest of the ITV network aired the football. ITV showed 16 FA Cup games per season, including the first pick of live matches from each of the first to sixth rounds of the competition, plus one semi-final exclusively live. The final was also shown live on ITV. Under the same 2008 contract, Setanta Sports showed three games and one replay in each round from round three to five, two quarter-finals, one semi-final and the final. The channel also broadcast ITV's matches, albeit with their own commentary teams, exclusively to Scotland, after STV's decision to replace the games with regular programming. Setanta entered administration in June 2009 and as a result the FA terminated Setanta's deal to broadcast FA-sanctioned competitions and England internationals.[101] The early rounds of the 2008‚Äì09 competition were covered for the first time by ITV's online service, ITV Local. The first match of the competition, between Wantage Town and Brading Town, was broadcast live online. Highlights of eight games of each round were broadcast as catch up on ITV Local.[102][103] Since ITV Local closed, this coverage did not continue. As a result of Setanta going out of business ITV showed the competition exclusively in the 2009‚Äì10 season with between three and four matches per round, all quarter finals, semi-finals and final live as the FA could not find a pay TV broadcaster in time. Many expected BSkyB to make a bid to show some of the remaining FA Cup games for the remainder of the 2009‚Äì10 season which would include a semi-final and shared rights to the final. In October 2009, The FA announced that ITV would show an additional match in the First and second rounds on ITV, with one replay match shown on ITV4. One match and one replay match from the first two rounds will broadcast on The FA website for free, in a similar situation to the 2010 World Cup Qualifier between Ukraine and England.[104] The 2009‚Äì10 first-round match between Oldham Athletic and Leeds United was the first FA Cup match to be streamed online live.[105] ESPN bought the competition for the 2010‚Äì11 to 2012‚Äì13 season and during this time Rebecca Lowe became the first woman to host the FA Cup Final in the UK. ESPN took over the package Setanta held for the FA Cup from the 2010‚Äì11 season.[106] The 2011 final was also shown live on Sky 3D in addition to ESPN (who provided the 3D coverage for Sky 3D) and ITV.[107] Following the sale of ESPN's UK and Ireland channels to BT, ESPN's rights package transferred to BT Sport from the 2013‚Äì14 season.[108] STV would continue to broadcast regular programming in place of FA Cup games, live draws and highlights shows throughout this period, although it did the broadcast the 2014 final live. ITV lost the rights to the FA Cup beginning with the 2014‚Äì15 FA Cup, terrestrial rights returned to BBC Sport, with the final being shown on BBC One while BT Sport hold the pay TV rights. Under this deal, the BBC will show around the same number of games as ITV and still having the first pick for each round.[109] Matches involving Welsh clubs are sometimes exclusively broadcast on Welsh language channel S4C, which is also available to view across the rest of the United Kingdom on satellite and cable television, and through the channel's website.[110] A similar arrangement is shared with BBC Cymru Wales when the corporation obtained the rights from 2014 to 2015, potentially giving the BBC an extra match per round.[111] On 23 May 2019, it was announced that ITV would replace BT Sport in broadcasting the FA Cup from the 2021‚Äì22 season, this new deal will see BBC and ITV become joint broadcasters of the tournament for the first time since 1988, this will mean for the first time that all FA Cup matches would all be exclusively broadcast on free-to-air television.[112] In addition, full coverage of the tournament returned to STV in Scotland, after the broadcaster replaced content from the competition with regular network programmes (as well as local content made in Scotland, plus films and specials) during the 2008 to 2014 period that ITV last held the rights. BBC Radio 5 Live and Talksport provides radio coverage including several full live commentaries per round, with additional commentaries broadcast on BBC Local Radio.",

The new edition of the Peacock‚Äôs hit competition show will welcome the return of Alan Cumming, who will play host to 21 ‚Äúlarger-than-life personalities who come together to compete in a series of missions with the objective of earning a cash prize of up to $250,000.‚Äù ‚ÄúHidden amongst the Faithful are the Traitors, whose goal is to eliminate the Faithful and claim the prize for themselves,‚Äù the official synopsis continues. ‚ÄúUnder the cover of darkness, the Traitors murder the Faithful one by one in a treacherous spree, while the Faithful try to uncover the Traitors and banish them from the game. If the Faithful contestants banish all the Traitors, they will share the prize fund, but if a Traitor or Traitors makes it to the end, they will steal all the money.‚Äù Unlike the British version, presented by Claudia Winkleman, the U.S. Traitors sees celebrities take on the challenges rather than everyday civilians.

                "title": "Mel Gibson - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Mel Columcille Gerard Gibson[3] AO (born January 3, 1956[4]) is an American actor and filmmaker. The recipient of multiple accolades, he is known for his action hero roles, particularly his breakout role as Max Rockatansky in the first three films of the post-apocalyptic action series Mad Max and as Martin Riggs in the buddy cop action-comedy film series Lethal Weapon. Born in Peekskill, New York, Gibson moved with his parents to Sydney, Australia, when he was 12 years old. He studied acting at the National Institute of Dramatic Art, where he starred opposite Judy Davis in a production of Romeo and Juliet. During the 1980s, he founded Icon Entertainment, a production company, which independent film director Atom Egoyan has called \"an alternative to the studio system\".[5] Director Peter Weir cast him as one of the leads in the World War I drama Gallipoli (1981), which earned Gibson a Best Actor Award from the Australian Film Institute.[6] In 1985, Gibson was named as People magazine's first Sexiest Man Alive.[7] In 1995, Gibson produced, directed, and starred in Braveheart, a historical epic, for which he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Director, the Academy Award for Best Director, and the Academy Award for Best Picture. He later directed and produced The Passion of the Christ, a biblical drama that was both financially successful and highly controversial. He received further critical notice for his directorial work of the action-adventure film Apocalypto (2006), which is set in Mesoamerica during the early 16th century. After several legal issues and controversial statements leaked to the public, Gibson's popularity in Hollywood declined, affecting his careers in acting and directing.[8] His career began seeing a resurgence with his performance in Edge of Darkness (2010) and Jodie Foster's The Beaver (2011). His directorial comeback after an absence of 10 years, Hacksaw Ridge (2016), won two Academy Awards,[9][10] and was nominated for another four including Best Picture and Best Director for Gibson, his second nomination in the category. Gibson was born in Peekskill, New York, of Irish descent, the sixth of 11 children, and the second son of Hutton Gibson, a writer, and Irish-born Anne Patricia (n√©e Reilly, died 1990).[11][12] Gibson's paternal grandmother was opera contralto Eva Mylott (1875‚Äì1920), who was born in Australia to Irish parents,[13] while his paternal grandfather, John Hutton Gibson, was a millionaire tobacco businessman from the Southern United States.[14][15] One of Gibson's younger brothers, Donal, is also an actor. Gibson's first name is derived from St Mel's Cathedral, situated in his mother's hometown of Longford.[16] His second name, Colmcille,[17] is also shared with an Irish saint.[18] Because of his mother, Gibson retains dual Irish and American citizenship.[19] Gibson is also an Australian permanent resident.[20][21] Gibson's father was awarded US$145,000 in a work-related-injury lawsuit against the New York Central Railroad on February 14, 1968 (equivalent to $1,270,450 in 2023), and soon afterwards relocated his family to West Pymble, Sydney, Australia.[22] Gibson was 12 years old at the time. The move to his grandmother's native Australia was for economic reasons, and his father's expectation that the Australian Defence Forces would reject his eldest son for the draft during the Vietnam War.[23] During his high school years, Gibson was educated by members of the Congregation of Christian Brothers at St Leo's Catholic College in Wahroonga, New South Wales.[24][25] Gibson gained very favorable notices from film critics when he first entered the cinematic scene, as well as comparisons to several classic movie stars. In 1982, Vincent Canby wrote that \"Mr. Gibson recalls the young Steve McQueen... I can't define 'star quality,' but whatever it is, Mr. Gibson has it.\"[26] Gibson has also been likened to \"a combination Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart.\"[27] Gibson's roles in the Mad Max series of films, Peter Weir's Gallipoli (1981), and the Lethal Weapon series of films earned him the label of \"action hero\".[28] Later, Gibson expanded into a variety of acting projects including human dramas such as the Franco Zeffirelli film version of Hamlet (1990), and comedic roles such as those in Maverick (1994) and What Women Want (2000). He expanded beyond acting into directing and producing, with: The Man Without a Face (1993), Braveheart (1995), The Passion of the Christ (2004), and Apocalypto (2006). Jess Cagle of Time compared Gibson with Cary Grant, Sean Connery, and Robert Redford.[28] Connery once suggested Gibson should play the next James Bond to Connery's \"M\". Gibson turned down the role, reportedly because he feared being typecast.[29] Gibson studied at the National Institute of Dramatic Art in Sydney.[30] As students, Gibson and actress Judy Davis played the leads in Romeo and Juliet, and Gibson played the role of Queen Titania in an experimental production of A Midsummer Night's Dream.[31] After graduation in 1977,[32] Gibson immediately began work on the filming of Mad Max, but continued to work as a stage actor, and joined the State Theatre Company of South Australia in Adelaide. Gibson's theatrical credits include the character Estragon (opposite Geoffrey Rush) in Waiting for Godot, and the role of Biff Loman in a 1982 production of Death of a Salesman in Sydney. Gibson's most recent theatrical performance, opposite Sissy Spacek, was the 1993 production of Love Letters by A. R. Gurney, in Telluride, Colorado.[33] While a student at NIDA, Gibson made his film debut in the 1977 film Summer City, for which he was paid $400.[34] Gibson then played the title character in the film Mad Max (1979). He was paid $9000 for this role. Shortly after making the film he did a season with the South Australian Theatre Company. During this period he shared a $30 a week apartment in Adelaide with his future wife Robyn Moore. After Mad Max, Gibson also played a mentally slow youth in the film Tim (also 1979).[35] During this period Gibson also appeared in Australian television series guest roles. He appeared in serial The Sullivans as naval lieutenant Ray Henderson,[36] in police procedural Cop Shop,[35] and in the pilot episode of prison serial Punishment which was produced in 1980, screened 1981.[37][38] Gibson joined the cast of the World War II action film Attack Force Z, which was not released until 1982 when Gibson had become a bigger star. Director Peter Weir cast Gibson as one of the leads in the World War I drama Gallipoli (1981), which earned Gibson another Best Actor Award from the Australian Film Institute.[6] Gallipoli also helped to earn Gibson the reputation of a serious, versatile actor and gained him the Hollywood agent Ed Limato. The sequel Mad Max 2 (1982) was his first hit in America, where it was released as The Road Warrior. Gibson again received positive notices for his role in Peter Weir's romantic thriller The Year of Living Dangerously (1982). Following a one-year hiatus from film acting after the birth of his twin sons, Gibson took on the role of Fletcher Christian in The Bounty (1984). Gibson earned his first million dollar salary for playing Max Rockatansky for the third time, in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985).[39][40] Gibson's first American film was Mark Rydell's drama The River (1984), in which he and Sissy Spacek played struggling Tennessee farmers. Gibson then starred in the Gothic romance Mrs. Soffel (also 1984) for Australian director Gillian Armstrong. He and Matthew Modine played condemned convict brothers opposite Diane Keaton as the warden's wife who visits them to read the Bible. In 1985, after working on four films in a row, Gibson took almost two years off at his Australian cattle station.[41] He returned to play the role of Martin Riggs in Lethal Weapon (1987), a film which helped to cement his status as a Hollywood \"leading man\".[42] Gibson's next film was Robert Towne's Tequila Sunrise (1988), followed by Lethal Weapon 2 (1989). Gibson next starred in three films back-to-back, all released in 1990: Bird on a Wire, Air America, and Hamlet. During the 1990s, Gibson alternated between commercial and personal projects. His films in the first half of the decade were Forever Young, Lethal Weapon 3, Maverick, and Braveheart. He then starred in Ransom, Conspiracy Theory, Lethal Weapon 4, and Payback. Gibson also served as the speaking and singing voice of John Smith in Disney's Pocahontas. Gibson was paid a record salary of $25 million to appear in The Patriot (2000).[43] It grossed over $100 million, as did two other films he featured in that year, Chicken Run and What Women Want.[28] In 2002, Gibson appeared in the Vietnam War drama We Were Soldiers and M. Night Shyamalan's Signs, which became the highest-grossing film of Gibson's acting career.[44] While promoting Signs, Gibson said that he no longer wanted to be a movie star and would only act in film again if the script were truly extraordinary. In 2010, Gibson appeared in Edge of Darkness, which marked his first starring role since 2002[45] and was an adaptation of the BBC miniseries, Edge of Darkness.[46] In June of the same year, Gibson was in Brownsville, Texas, filming scenes for the film Get the Gringo, about a career criminal put in a tough prison in Mexico.[47] In 2010, following an outburst at his ex-girlfriend that was made public, Gibson was dropped from the talent agency of William Morris Endeavor.[48] Gibson was lined up for a small role in The Hangover Part II but he was removed from the film after the cast and crew objected to his involvement.[49] Gibson also played two villains: Luther Voz in Machete Kills in 2013, opposite Danny Trejo, and Conrad Stonebanks in The Expendables 3 opposite Sylvester Stallone in 2014. Gibson appeared in the lead role of director S. Craig Zahler's police brutality-themed film Dragged Across Concrete, released in 2018.[50] He then starred in The Professor and the Madman ‚Äì he and the director both disowned the film. After his success in Hollywood with the Lethal Weapon series, Gibson began to move into producing and directing. With partner Bruce Davey, Gibson formed Icon Productions in 1989 in order to make Hamlet. In addition to producing or co-producing many of Gibson's own star vehicles, Icon has turned out many other small films, ranging from Immortal Beloved to An Ideal Husband. Gibson has taken supporting roles in some of these films, such as The Million Dollar Hotel and The Singing Detective. Gibson has also produced a number of projects for television, including a biopic on the Three Stooges and the 2008 PBS documentary Carrier. Icon has grown from being just a production company to also be an international distribution company and film exhibitor in Australia and New Zealand.[51] Gibson is credited as an executive producer of the 2023 movie Sound of Freedom, a film based on a true story which revolves around the topic of trafficking of children.[52] According to Robert Downey Jr., studio executives encouraged Gibson in 1989 to try directing, an idea he rebuffed at the time.[53] Gibson made his directorial debut in 1993 with The Man Without a Face, followed two years later by Braveheart, which earned Gibson the Academy Award for Best Director. Gibson had long planned to direct a remake of Fahrenheit 451, but in 1999 the project was indefinitely postponed because of scheduling conflicts.[54] Gibson was scheduled to direct Robert Downey Jr. in a Los Angeles stage production of Hamlet in January 2001, but Downey's drug relapse ended the project.[55] In 2002, while promoting We Were Soldiers and Signs to the press, Gibson mentioned that he was planning to pare back on acting and return to directing.[56] In September 2002, Gibson announced that he would direct a film called The Passion in Aramaic and Latin with no subtitles because he hoped to \"transcend language barriers with filmic storytelling.\"[57] In 2004, he released the controversial film The Passion of the Christ, with subtitles, which he co-wrote, co-produced, and directed. The film went on to become the highest-grossing rated R film at the time with $370,782,930 in U.S. box office sales.[58] Gibson directed a few episodes of Complete Savages for the ABC network. In 2006, he directed the action-adventure film Apocalypto, his second film to feature sparse dialogue in a non-English language. Gibson has expressed an intention to direct a movie set during the Viking Age, starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Like The Passion of the Christ and Apocalypto, he wants this speculative film to feature dialogue in period languages.[59] However, DiCaprio ultimately opted out of the project.[60] In a 2012 interview, Gibson announced that the project, which he has titled Berserker, was still moving forward.[61] In 2011, it was announced that Gibson had commissioned a screenplay from Joe Eszterhas about the Maccabees. The film is to be distributed by Warner Brothers Pictures. The announcement generated significant controversy.[62] In April 2012, Eszterhas wrote a letter to Gibson accusing him of sabotaging their film about the Maccabees because he \"hates Jews\", and cited a series of private incidents during which he allegedly heard Gibson express extremely racist views. Although written as a private letter, it was subsequently published on a film industry website.[63] In response, Gibson stated that he still intends to make the film, but will not base it upon Eszterhas's script, which he called substandard.[64] Eszterhas then claimed his son had secretly recorded a number of Gibson's alleged \"hateful rants\".[65] In a 2012 interview, Gibson explained that the Maccabees film was still in preparation. He explained that he was drawn to the Biblical account of the uprising due to its similarity to the American Old West genre.[61] In June 2016, Gibson announced that he will reunite with Braveheart screenwriter Randall Wallace to make a sequel for The Passion of the Christ, focusing on the resurrection of Jesus.[66] In early November 2016, Gibson revealed on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert that the sequel's title will be The Passion of the Christ: Resurrection. He also stated that the project could \"probably be three years off\" because \"it's a big subject\".[67] In January 2023, it was reported that the sequel will begin filming later that year.[68] In November 2016, film critic Matt Zoller Seitz named Gibson as \"the pre-eminent religious filmmaker in the United States\".[69] In May 2018, it was announced that Gibson would be directing a WWII film titled Destroyer.[70] Destroyer, similar to Hacksaw Ridge, will also deal with the Battle of Okinawa in the Pacific Theater, although from a different front. It will be based on the heroic story of the crew belonging to USS Laffey (DD-724), who defended their ship from 22 kamikaze attacks. In September 2018, it was announced that Gibson would direct and co-write a remake of the 1969 film, The Wild Bunch.[71] In May 2019, Deadline reported that Gibson was courting Michael Fassbender, Jamie Foxx, and Peter Dinklage to star in the project; that Jerry Bruckheimer will produce the film, and Warner Bros. will finance and release the project.[72] In 2021, after the death of Lethal Weapon director Richard Donner, Gibson has stated that he will direct, and also star, in a Lethal Weapon 5.[73] In May 2023, it was announced that Gibson would direct a film titled Flight Risk, starring Mark Wahlberg. Set to be released by Lionsgate, the film will star Wahlberg as \"a pilot transporting a dangerous criminal for trial.\"[74] It was later reported that the film had begun shooting in Las Vegas on June 16. Filming was reportedly unaffected by the SAG-AFTRA strike, having been exempted as an independent project.[75] Gibson has credited his directors, particularly George Miller, Peter Weir, and Richard Donner, with teaching him the craft of filmmaking and influencing him as a director. As a director, Gibson sometimes breaks the tension on set by having his actors perform serious scenes wearing a red clown nose.[76] Helena Bonham Carter said of him, \"He has a very basic sense of humor. It's a bit lavatorial and not very sophisticated.\"[77] Gibson inserted a single frame of himself smoking a cigarette into the 2005 teaser trailer of Apocalypto.[78] Gibson's screen acting career began in 1976, with a role on the Australian television series The Sullivans. In his career, Gibson has appeared in 43 films, including the Mad Max and Lethal Weapon film series. In addition to acting, Gibson has also directed four films, including Braveheart and The Passion of the Christ; produced 11 films; and written two films. Films either starring or directed by Mel Gibson have earned over US$2.5 billion, in the United States alone.[79][80] Gibson's filmography includes television series, feature films, television films, and animated films. Gibson got his breakthrough role as the leather-clad post-apocalyptic survivor in George Miller's Mad Max. The independently financed blockbuster helped to make him an international star. In the United States, the actors' Australian accents were dubbed with American accents.[81] The original film spawned two sequels: Mad Max 2 (known in North America as The Road Warrior) and Mad Max 3 (known in North America as Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome). A fourth movie, Mad Max: Fury Road (2015), was made with Tom Hardy in the title role.[82] The 1981 Peter Weir film Gallipoli is about a group of young men from rural Western Australia who enlist in the Australian Imperial Force during World War I. They are sent to invade the Ottoman Empire, where they take part in the 1915 Gallipoli campaign. During the course of the movie, the young men slowly lose their innocence about the war. The climax of the movie centers on the catastrophic Australian offensive known as the Battle of the Nek. Peter Weir cast Gibson in the role of Frank Dunne, an Irish-Australian drifter with an intense cynicism about fighting for the British Empire. Newcomer Mark Lee was recruited to play the idealistic Archy Hamilton after participating in a photo session for the director. Gibson later recalled: I'd auditioned for an earlier film and he told me right up front, \"I'm not going to cast you for this part. You're not old enough. But thanks for coming in, I just wanted to meet you.\" He told me he wanted me for Gallipoli a couple of years later because I wasn't the archetypal Australian. He had Mark Lee, the angelic-looking, ideal Australian kid, and he wanted something of a modern sensibility. He thought the audience needed someone to relate to of their own time.[83] Gibson later said that Gallipoli is, \"Not really a war movie. That's just the backdrop. It's really the story of two young men.\" The critically acclaimed film helped to further launch Gibson's career.[84][85] He won the award for Best Actor in a Leading Role from the Australian Film Institute.[6] Gibson played a na√Øve but ambitious journalist opposite Sigourney Weaver and Linda Hunt in Peter Weir's atmospheric 1982 film The Year of Living Dangerously, based on the novel of the same name by Christopher Koch. The movie was both a critical and commercial success, and the upcoming Australian actor was heavily marketed by MGM studio. In his review of the film, Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, \"If this film doesn't make an international star of Mr. Gibson, then nothing will. He possesses both the necessary talent and the screen presence.\"[86] According to John Hiscock of The Daily Telegraph, the film did, indeed, establish Gibson as an international talent.[87] Gibson was initially reluctant to accept the role of Guy Hamilton. \"I didn't necessarily see my role as a great challenge. My character was, like the film suggests, a puppet. And I went with that. It wasn't some star thing, even though they advertised it that way.\"[88] Gibson saw some similarities between himself and the character of Guy. \"He's not a silver-tongued devil. He's kind of immature and he has some rough edges and I guess you could say the same for me.\"[27] Gibson followed the footsteps of Errol Flynn, Clark Gable, and Marlon Brando by starring as Fletcher Christian in a cinematic retelling of the Mutiny on the Bounty. The resulting 1984 film The Bounty is considered to be the most historically accurate version. However, Gibson has expressed a belief that the film's revisionism did not go far enough. He has stated that his character should have been portrayed as the film's antagonist. He has further praised Anthony Hopkins's performance as Lieutenant William Bligh as the best aspect of the film.[88] Gibson moved into more mainstream commercial filmmaking with the popular action comedy film series Lethal Weapon, which began with the 1987 original. In the films he played LAPD Detective Martin Riggs, a recently widowed Vietnam veteran with a death wish and a penchant for violence and gunplay. In the films, he is partnered with a reserved family man named Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) and starting with the second film, they're joined by a hyperactive informant named Leo Getz (Joe Pesci). Following the success of Lethal Weapon, director Richard Donner and principal cast revisited the characters in three sequels, Lethal Weapon 2 (1989), Lethal Weapon 3 (1993), and Lethal Weapon 4 (1998). With its fourth installment, the Lethal Weapon series embodied \"the quintessence of the buddy cop pic\".[89] The film series has since been rebooted with a television adaptation, which aired for three seasons on FOX. On November 15, 2021, Gibson confirmed that he will direct the fifth Lethal Weapon film following the death of director Richard Donner. \"The man who directed all the 'Lethal films', Richard Donner, he was a big guy. He was developing the screenplay and he got pretty far along with it. And he said to me one day, 'Listen kid, if I kick the bucket you will do it.' And I said: 'Shut up.' But he did indeed pass away. But he did ask me to do it and at the time I didn't say anything. He said it to his wife and to the studio and the producer. So I will be directing the fifth one\" Gibson said.[90] In June 2024, Gibson confirmed in an interview with the Inspire Me podcast that he would direct the fifth installment of the Lethal Weapon franchise and that the film would stay true to Donner's vision and influence.[91][92] Gibson also stated that he and Glover would return to play their respective roles of Riggs and Murtaugh.[93] Gibson made the unusual transition from action to classical drama, playing William Shakespeare's Danish prince in Franco Zeffirelli's Hamlet. Gibson was cast alongside experienced Shakespearean actors Ian Holm, Alan Bates, and Paul Scofield. He compared working with Scofield to being \"thrown into the ring with Mike Tyson\".[94] Scofield said of Gibson \"Not the sort of actor you'd think would make an ideal Hamlet, but he had enormous integrity and intelligence.\"[95] In 1995, Gibson directed, produced, and starred in Braveheart, a biographical film of Sir William Wallace, a Scottish nationalist who was executed in 1305 for \"high treason\" against King Edward I of England. Gibson received two Academy Awards, Best Director and Best Picture, for his second directorial effort. In winning the Academy Award for Best Director, Gibson became only the sixth actor-turned-filmmaker to do so.[96] Braveheart influenced the Scottish nationalist movement and helped to revive the film genre of the historical epic; the Battle of Stirling Bridge sequence is considered by critics to be one of the all-time best-directed battle scenes.[97] The film's depiction of the Prince of Wales as an effeminate homosexual caused the film to be attacked by Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD), which was especially enraged by a scene in which King Edward I murders his son's male lover by throwing him out of a castle window.[98] Gibson, who had previously been reported making several homophobic statements,[99] now replied, \"The fact that King Edward throws this character out a window has nothing to do with him being gay ... He's terrible to his son, to everybody.\"[98] Gibson asserted that the reason that King Edward I kills his son's lover is because the king is a \"psychopath\".[100] Gibson also expressed bewilderment that some filmgoers laughed at this murder: We cut a scene out, unfortunately ... where you really got to know that character (Edward II) and to understand his plight and his pain... But it just stopped the film in the first act so much that you thought, \"When's this story going to start?\"[101] Gibson directed, produced, co-wrote, and funded the film The Passion of the Christ (2004), which chronicled the passion and death of Jesus (Jim Caviezel). The film was shot exclusively in Aramaic, Latin, and Hebrew. Gibson originally intended to release the film without subtitles, but eventually relented for theatrical exhibition. The film sparked divergent reviews, ranging from high praise to criticism of the violence. The Anti-Defamation League accused Gibson of antisemitism over the film's unflattering depiction of Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin. In The Nation, reviewer Katha Pollitt wrote: \"Gibson has violated just about every precept of the conference's own 1988 'Criteria' for the portrayal of Jews in dramatizations of the Passion (no bloodthirsty Jews, no rabble, no use of Scripture that reinforces negative stereotypes of Jews, etc.) ... The priests have big noses and gnarly faces, lumpish bodies, yellow teeth; Herod Antipas and his court are a bizarre collection of oily-haired, epicene perverts. The 'good Jews' look like Italian movie stars (Magdalene actually is an Italian movie star, the lovely Monica Bellucci); Mary, who would have been around 50 and appeared 70, could pass for a ripe 35.\"[102] Among those to defend Gibson were Orthodox Jewish rabbi Daniel Lapin and radio personality Michael Medved.[103] Referring to ADL National Director Abraham Foxman, Rabbi Lapin said that by calling The Passion of the Christ antisemitic, \"what he is saying is that the only way (for Christians) to escape the wrath of Foxman is to repudiate (their own) faith.\"[103] In an interview with The Globe and Mail, Gibson stated: \"If anyone has distorted Gospel passages to rationalize cruelty towards Jews or anyone, it's in defiance of repeated Papal condemnation. The Papacy has condemned racism in any form... Jesus died for the sins of all times, and I'll be the first on the line for culpability\".[104] Eventually, the continued media attacks began to anger Gibson. After Hutton Gibson's Holocaust denial was used to attack his son's film in print by The New York Times writer Frank Rich,[105] an enraged Mel Gibson retorted, \"I want to kill him. I want his intestines on a stick.... I want to kill his dog.\"[106][107] Gibson's Traditionalist Catholic upbringing was also the target of criticism. In a 2006 interview with Diane Sawyer, Gibson stated that he feels that his \"human rights were violated\" by the often vitriolic attacks on his person, his family, and his religious beliefs which were sparked by The Passion.[108] The film grossed US$611,899,420 worldwide and $370,782,930 in the U.S. alone,[109] surpassing any motion picture starring Gibson.[110] In U.S. box offices, it became the seventh-highest-grossing (at the time) film in history[111] and the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time.[112] The film was nominated for three Academy Awards[113] and won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Dramatic Motion Picture.[114] Gibson received further critical acclaim for his directing of the 2006 action-adventure film Apocalypto.[115] Gibson's fourth directorial effort is set in Mesoamerica during the early 16th century against the turbulent end times of a Maya civilization. The sparse dialogue is spoken in the Yucatec Maya language by a cast of Native American descent.[116][117] Gibson himself has stated that the film is an attempt at making a deliberate point about great civilizations and what causes them to decline and disintegrate. Gibson said, \"People think that modern man is so enlightened, but we're susceptible to the same forces‚Äîand we are also capable of the same heroism and transcendence.\"[118][119] This theme is further explored by a quote from Will Durant, which is superimposed at the very beginning of the film: \"A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within.\" Gibson starred in The Beaver, a domestic drama about a depressed alcoholic directed by former Maverick costar Jodie Foster.[120] The Beaver premiered at the South by Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas on March 16, 2011. The opening weekend in 22 theaters was considered a flop; it made $104,000 which comes to a per-theater average of $4,745.[121] The film's distributor, Summit Entertainment, had originally planned for a wide release of The Beaver for the weekend of May 20, but after the initial box-office returns for the film, the company changed course and decided instead to give the film a \"limited art-house run\".[122] Michael Cieply of The New York Times observed on June 5, 2011, that the film had cleared just about $1 million, making it a certified \"flop\".[123] Director Jodie Foster opined that the film did not do well with American audiences because it was a dramedy, and \"very often Americans are not comfortable with [that]\".[124] Before its release, much of the coverage focussed on the unavoidable association between the protagonist's issues and Mel Gibson's own well-publicized personal and legal problems (see ¬ß Alcohol abuse and legal issues), including a conviction of battery of his ex-girlfriend.[125] Wrote Time magazine, \"The Beaver is a somber, sad domestic drama featuring an alcoholic in acute crisis ... It's hard to separate Gibson's true-life story from what's happening onscreen.\"[126] In 2014, Gibson signed on to direct Hacksaw Ridge, a World War II drama based on the true story of conscientious objector Desmond T. Doss, played by Andrew Garfield.[127] The film premiered at the 73rd Venice Film Festival in September 2016[128] and received what The New Zealand Herald calls \"rave reviews\".[129][130] It has won or been nominated for many awards, including Golden Globe nominations for Best Picture, Best Director for Gibson, and Best Actor for Garfield. Hacksaw Ridge was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Film Editing.[131][132] The film grossed $164 million worldwide, four times its production costs.[133] Gibson met Robyn Denise Moore in 1977,[134] soon after filming Mad Max, in Adelaide, South Australia. At the time, Robyn was a dental nurse and Mel was an unknown actor working for the South Australian Theatre Company.[135] On June 7, 1980, Mel and Robyn were married in a Catholic church in Forestville, New South Wales.[136] They have one daughter, Hannah (b. 1980, married Kenny Wayne Shepherd in 2006), and six sons: twins Edward and Christian (b. 1982), William (b. 1985), Louis (b. 1988), Milo (b. 1990), and Thomas (b. 1999); and seven grandchildren as of 2024[update].[137][138] After 26 years of marriage, Gibson and Robyn separated on July 29, 2006.[139][140] In a 2011 interview, Gibson stated that the separation began the day following his arrest for drunk driving in Malibu.[141] Robyn Gibson filed for divorce on April 13, 2009, citing irreconcilable differences. In a joint statement, the Gibsons declared, \"Throughout our marriage and separation we have always striven to maintain the privacy and integrity of our family and will continue to do so.\"[17] The divorce filing followed the March 2009 release of photographs appearing to show him on a beach embracing his live-in girlfriend of one year, Russian songwriter and pianist Oksana Grigorieva.[142][143] The Gibsons' divorce was finalized on December 23, 2011, and the settlement with his ex-wife was said to be the highest in Hollywood history at over $400 million.[144] The couple reportedly did not have a prenuptial agreement; because California is a community property state,[145] Robyn Gibson received half of everything her husband had earned during their marriage.[144] In a 2010 interview, Grigorieva stated that, when she first began being wooed by Gibson, she was surprised and only accepted his advances after learning that the actor-director and his wife had been separated for more than 18 months. Grigorieva added, \"He wrote me a lot of poetry. It was very beautiful, impressionistic, like an edgy, modern iambic pentameter. Mel has a really good grasp of language, he's fantastic with words.\"[146] On April 28, 2009, Gibson made a red carpet-appearance with Grigorieva. She had previously had a son with actor Timothy Dalton[147] and gave birth to Gibson's daughter Lucia on October 30, 2009.[148][149][150] By April 2010, Gibson and Grigorieva had split.[151] On June 21, 2010, Grigorieva filed a restraining order against Gibson to keep him away from her and their child. The restraining order was modified the next day regarding Gibson's contact with their child.[152] Gibson obtained a restraining order against Grigorieva on June 25, 2010.[152][153] Grigorieva accused Gibson of domestic violence, leading to an investigation by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department in July 2010.[155][156] On July 9, 2010, some audio recordings of a rant, allegedly directed by Gibson toward Grigorieva, were posted on the internet.[157] The same day Gibson was dropped by his agency, William Morris Endeavor.[157] Gibson's estranged wife Robyn filed a court statement declaring that she never experienced any abuse from Gibson;[158] while forensic experts have questioned the validity of some of the tapes, Gibson himself did not deny they were accurate at the time.[159] In March 2011, Mel Gibson agreed to plead no contest to a misdemeanor battery charge.[160] In April 2011, Gibson finally broke his silence about the incident in question. In an interview with Deadline Hollywood, Gibson expressed gratitude to longtime friends Whoopi Goldberg and Jodie Foster, both of whom had spoken publicly in his defense. About the recordings, Gibson said, I've never treated anyone badly or in a discriminatory way based on their gender, race, religion or sexuality‚Äîperiod. I don't blame some people for thinking that though, from the garbage they heard on those leaked tapes, which have been edited. You have to put it all in the proper context of being in an irrationally, heated discussion at the height of a breakdown, trying to get out of a really unhealthy relationship. It's one terribly awful moment in time, said to one person, in the span of one day and doesn't represent what I truly believe or how I've treated people my entire life.[141] In the same interview, Gibson stated I was allowed to end the case and still maintain my innocence. It's called a West Plea[161] and it's not something that prosecutors normally allow. But in my case, the prosecutors and the judge agreed that it was the right thing to do. I could have continued to fight this for years and it probably would have come out fine. But I ended it for my children and my family. This was going to be such a circus. You don't drag other people in your life through this sewer needlessly, so I'll take the hit and move on.[141] In August 2011, Gibson settled with Grigorieva, who was awarded $750,000, joint legal custody, and a house in Sherman Oaks, California until their daughter Lucia turns 18. In 2013, Grigorieva sued her attorneys, accusing them of advising her to sign a bad agreement, including a term that taking legal action against Gibson would compromise her financial settlement.[162] As of 2014, Gibson is in a relationship with former champion equestrian vaulter and writer Rosalind Ross.[163][164] Ross gave birth to their son, and Gibson's ninth child, Lars Gerard, on January 20, 2017, in Los Angeles.[165] Gibson is a property investor, with multiple properties in Malibu, California, several locations in Costa Rica, a private island in Fiji, and properties in Australia.[166][167] In December 2004, Gibson sold his 300 acres (1.2 km2) Australian farm in the Kiewa Valley for $6 million.[168] Also in December 2004, Gibson purchased Mago Island in Fiji from Tokyu Corporation of Japan for $15 million. Descendants of the original native inhabitants of Mago, who were displaced in the 1860s, have protested the purchase. Gibson stated it was his intention to retain the pristine environment of the undeveloped island.[169] In early 2005, he sold his 45,000 acres (180 km2) Montana ranch to a neighbor.[170] In April 2007, he purchased a 400 acres (1.6 km2) ranch in Costa Rica for $26 million, and, in July 2007, he sold his 76 acres (31 ha) Tudor estate in Connecticut (which he purchased in 1994 for $9 million) for $40 million to an unnamed buyer.[171] Also that month, he sold a Malibu property for $30 million that he had purchased for $24 million two years before.[172] In 2008, he purchased the Malibu home of actors David Duchovny and T√©a Leoni.[173] Records of Gibson using offshore accounts and business were revealed in the Jersey Leaks, records of more than 20,000 individuals held with the wealth management firm Kleinwort Benson.[174] Gibson and his former wife have contributed a substantial amount of money to various charities, one of which is Healing the Children. According to Cris Embleton, one of the founders, the Gibsons gave millions to provide lifesaving medical treatment to needy children worldwide.[175][176] They also supported the restoration of Renaissance artwork[177] and gave millions of dollars to NIDA.[178] Gibson donated $500,000 to the El Mirador Basin Project to protect the last tract of virgin rain forest in Central America and to fund archeological excavations in the \"cradle of Mayan civilization\".[179] In July 2007, Gibson again visited Central America to make arrangements for donations to the indigenous population. Gibson met with Costa Rican President √ìscar Arias to discuss how to \"channel the funds\".[180] During the same month, Gibson pledged to give financial assistance to a Malaysian company named Green Rubber Global for a tire recycling factory located in Gallup, New Mexico.[181] While on a business trip to Singapore in September 2007, Gibson donated to a local charity for children with chronic and terminal illnesses.[182] Gibson is also a supporter of Angels at Risk, a nonprofit organization focusing on education about drug and alcohol abuse among teens.[183] In a 2011 interview, Gibson said of his philanthropic works, \"It gives you perspective. It's one of my faults, you tend to focus on yourself a lot. Which is not always the healthiest thing for your psyche or anything else. If you take a little time out to think about other people, it's good. It's uplifting.\"[184] Gibson was raised a sedevacantist traditionalist Catholic (who reject the validity of all Popes since the Second Vatican Council and hold that the Holy See is currently vacant).[23] His father Hutton Gibson was an ardent sedevacantist and a Holocaust denier who held strong antisemitic views and supported various conspiracy theories.[185] During the filming of The Passion of The Christ, he had daily visits from both local priests and priests from the traditionalist Institute of Christ the King (a non-sedevacantist group in full communion with the Pope) in France.[186] When asked about the Catholic doctrine of Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus, Gibson replied, \"There is no salvation for those outside the Church ... I believe it. Put it this way. My wife is a saint. She's a much better person than I am. Honestly. She's ... Episcopalian, Church of England. She prays, she believes in God, she knows Jesus, she believes in that stuff. And it's just not fair if she doesn't make it, she's better than I am. But that is a pronouncement from the chair. I go with it.\"[106][187] When he was asked whether John 14:6 is an intolerant position, he said that \"through the merits of Jesus' sacrifice ... even people who don't know Jesus are able to be saved, but through him.\"[188] Gibson's acquaintance Fr. William Fulco said in 2009 that Gibson denies neither the pope nor Vatican II; even so, as of 2021, Gibson attended the Church of the Holy Family, a traditionalist church he founded and funds in Southern California.[189] Gibson has told Diane Sawyer that he believes non-Catholics and non-Christians can go to Heaven.[108][190] In a 1990 interview with Barbara Walters, Gibson said: \"God is the only one who knows how many children we should have, and we should be ready to accept them. One can't decide for oneself who comes into this world and who doesn't. That decision doesn't belong to us.\"[191] Gibson, in a letter published by Italian Traditionalist Catholic author Aldo Maria Valli, on his website, on 6 July 2024, stated his full support for the recently excommunicated Italian archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan√≤, who he praised as a \"a modern day Athanasius!\", stating that he agreed with him in considering that the \"post conciliar church of Vatican II is a counterfeit church\", and that \"being called a schismatic & being excommunicated by Jorge Bergoglio is like a badge of honor when you consider he is a total apostate & expels you from a false institution.\" He also stated that \"I am with you & I hope Bergoglio excommunicates me from his false church also.\"[192] In a July 1995 interview with Playboy, Gibson said President Bill Clinton was a \"low-level opportunist\" and someone was \"telling him what to do\". He said that the Rhodes Scholarship was established for young men and women who want to strive for a \"new world order\" and this was a campaign for Marxism.[193] Gibson later backed away from such conspiracy theories saying, \"It was like: 'Hey, tell us a conspiracy'... so I laid out this thing, and suddenly, it was like I was talking the gospel truth, espousing all this political shit like I believed in it.\"[194] In the same 1995 Playboy interview, Gibson argued against ordaining women to the priesthood.[195] In 2004, he publicly spoke out against taxpayer-funded embryonic stem-cell research that involves the cloning and destruction of human embryos.[196] In March 2005, he condemned the outcome of the Terri Schiavo case, referring to Schiavo's death as \"state-sanctioned murder\".[197] Gibson questioned the Iraq War in March 2004.[198] In 2006, Gibson said that the \"fearmongering\" depicted in his film Apocalypto \"reminds me a little of President Bush and his guys.\"[199] He later said in 2016 that he is anti-war but has an appreciation for the sacrifices made by \"warriors\".[200] Gibson complimented filmmaker Michael Moore and his documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 when he and Moore were recognized at the 2005 People's Choice Awards.[201] Gibson's Icon Productions originally agreed to finance Moore's film but later sold the rights to Miramax Films. Moore said that his agent Ari Emanuel claimed that \"top Republicans\" called Gibson to tell him, \"don't expect to get more invitations to the White House\".[202] Icon's spokesman dismissed this story, saying \"We never run from a controversy. You'd have to be out of your mind to think that of the company that just put out The Passion of the Christ.\"[203] In a 2011 interview, Gibson stated: The whole notion of politics is they always present you with this or this or this. I'll get a newspaper to read between the lines. Why do you have to adhere to prescribed formulas that they have and people argue over them and they're all in a box. And you watch Fox claw CNN, and CNN claw Fox. Sometimes I catch a piece of the news and it seems insanity to me. I quietly support candidates. I'm not out there banging a drum for candidates. But I have supported a candidate and it's a whole other world. Once you've been exposed to it, once or twice or however many times, if you know the facts and see how they're presented, it's mind-boggling. It's a very scary arena to be in, but I do vote. I go in there and pull the lever. It's kind of like pulling the lever and watching the trap door fall out from beneath you. Why should we trust any of these people? None of them ever deliver on anything. It's always disappointing.[141] Gibson revealed in a 2016 interview with Jorge Ramos that he voted for neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton in the 2016 United States presidential election.[204] In July 2021, Gibson was recorded saluting Trump while attending UFC 264, which went viral over the Internet.[205][206][207] In October 2020, Gibson released a statement regarding the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War and expressing solidarity with the Armenian people.[208] Gibson endorsed Trump in the 2024 United States presidential election, and said that Kamala Harris had the IQ of a fence post.[209] Gibson has said that he started drinking at the age of 13.[210] In a 2002 interview for the documentary actingclassof1977.com, made by his former National Institute of Dramatic Art colleague Sally McKenzie, Gibson said, \"I had really good highs but some very low lows.\"[211] Gibson was banned from driving in Ontario, Canada, for three months in 1984, after rear-ending a car in Toronto while under the influence of alcohol.[212] He retreated to his Australian farm for over a year to recover, but he continued to struggle with drinking. Despite this problem, Gibson gained a reputation in Hollywood for professionalism and punctuality such that frequent collaborator Richard Donner was shocked when Gibson confided that he was drinking five pints of beer for breakfast.[108] Reflecting in 2003 and 2004, Gibson said that despair in his mid-30s led him to contemplate suicide, and he meditated on Christ's Passion to heal his wounds.[108][187][213] He took more time off acting in 1991 and sought professional help.[214] That year, Gibson's attorneys were unsuccessful at blocking the Sunday Mirror from publishing what Gibson shared at AA meetings.[215] In 1992, Gibson provided financial support to Hollywood's Recovery Center, saying, \"Alcoholism is something that runs in my family. It's something that's close to me. People do come back from it, and it's a miracle.\"[216] On August 17, 2006, Gibson pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor drunken-driving charge and was sentenced to three years' probation.[217] He was ordered to attend self-help meetings five times a week for four-and-a-half months and three times a week for the remainder of the first year of his probation. He was also ordered to attend a First Offenders Program and fined $1,300, and his license was restricted for 90 days.[217] The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) accused Gibson of homophobia after a December 1991 interview in the Spanish newspaper El Pa√≠s in which he made derogatory comments about gay people.[99][218] Gibson later defended his comments,[99] and rejected calls to apologize even as he faced fresh accusations of homophobia in the wake of his film Braveheart.[193] Gibson joined GLAAD in hosting 10 lesbian and gay filmmakers for an on-location seminar on the set of the movie Conspiracy Theory in January 1997.[219] In 1999, when asked about the comments to El Pa√≠s, Gibson said, \"I shouldn't have said it, but I was tickling a bit of vodka during that interview, and the quote came back to bite me on the ass.\"[194] On July 28, 2006, Gibson was arrested by Sheriff's Deputy James Mee of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department for driving under the influence (DUI) while speeding in his vehicle with an open container of alcohol. According to a 2011 article in Vanity Fair, Gibson first told the arresting officer, \"My life is over. I'm fucked. Robyn's going to leave me.\"[220] According to the arrest report, Gibson exploded into an angry tirade when the arresting officer would not allow him to drive home. In what Vanity Fair was later told was an attempt at suicide by cop,[220] Gibson said to the arresting officer, \"Fucking Jews... the Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world. Are you a Jew?\"[221][222][223] After the arrest report was leaked on TMZ.com, Gibson issued two apologies through his publicist,[224] and‚Äîin a televised interview with Diane Sawyer‚Äîhe affirmed the accuracy of the quotations.[225] He further apologized for his \"despicable\" behavior, saying that the comments were \"blurted out in a moment of insanity\",[217] and asked to meet with Jewish leaders to help him \"discern the appropriate path for healing.\"[226] After Gibson's arrest, his publicist said he had entered a recovery program to battle alcoholism. Winona Ryder has repeatedly told a story to various press outlets about speaking to Mel Gibson with her friend at party. Gibson allegedly responded to her friend, who was gay, by asking if he was going to get AIDS from speaking with him, and later asked Ryder if she was an \"oven dodger.\"[227] A representative of Gibson later denied the accusations.[228] In July 2010, Gibson had been recorded during a phone call with Grigorieva suggesting that if she got \"raped by a pack of niggers\", she would be to blame.[229][230][231][232] Grigorieva said the voices on the multiple recordings leaked were of herself and Gibson, according to CNN.[233] He was barred from coming near Grigorieva or their daughter due to a domestic violence-related restraining order.[229] The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department launched a domestic violence investigation against Gibson,[156] later dropped when Gibson pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor battery charge.[160] Gibson's controversial statements resulted in him being blacklisted in Hollywood for almost a decade.[234] Both Robert Downey Jr. and journalist Allison Hope Weiner advocated for forgiveness for Gibson in 2014.[235][236] In 2016, Gibson's film Hacksaw Ridge, which received six Academy Award nominations, resulted in what was perceived as a \"thaw\" in his reputation.[237] In 1985, Gibson was named the \"Sexiest Man Alive\" by People, the first person to be named so.[238] Gibson quietly declined the Chevalier des Arts et Lettres from the French government in 1995 as a protest against France's resumption of nuclear testing in the Southwest Pacific.[239] On July 25, 1997, Gibson was named an honorary Officer of the Order of Australia (AO), in recognition of his \"service to the Australian film industry\". The award was honorary because substantive awards are made only to Australian citizens.[240][241]",

                "content": "Mel Columcille Gerard Gibson AO (born January 3, 1956)[2] is an American actor and film director.[3][4][5][6] He is mostly known for his roles in action. Among his most famous roles are in Mad Max (1979), Gallipoli (1981), The Bounty (1984), Lethal Weapon (1987), and Braveheart (1995).[2] He directed The Passion of the Christ in 2004. He loosely based it on the visions of St. Catherine Emmerich. Gibson was born in Peekskill, New York, United States. His father, Hutton Gibson, was a veteran soldier during World War II, and was also a famous writer. His family moved to Australia in 1968, when he was 12.[7] He studied acting at the National Institute of Dramatic Art in Sydney. He also has Irish citizenship.[8] During the 1980s, Gibson founded Icon Entertainment, a production company, which Atom Egoyan described as \"an alternative to the studio system\". When director Peter Weir cast him as a major character in World War I drama Gallipoli, he earned a Best Actor from the Australian Film Institute Awards,[9] which cemented him as an serious, versatile and recognisable actor. In 1995, Gibson received the Academy Award for Best Picture and the Academy Award for Best Director for his work on Braveheart. He later directed and produced The Passion of the Christ in 2004, a controversial[10] drama regarding Jesus, which was viewed as antisemitic by many people. Allegations of antisemitism and racism by Gibson led to a downfall in his career,[11] and later revived his career, particularly with the 2016‚Äôs Hacksaw Ridge, which won two Academy Awards[12][13] and was nominated for an additional four. Mel Columcille Gerard Gibson was born in Peekskill, New York, as the sixth of 11 children. He is of Irish descent, and the second son of Hutton Gibson, a writer, and Irish-born Anne Patricia (nee Reilly, died 1990).[14][15] Gibson‚Äôs paternal grandmother was opera contralto Eva Mylott (1875‚Äì1920), who was born in Australia, to Irish parents,[16] while his paternal grandfather, John Hutton Gibson, was a millionaire and tobacco businessman from the South.[17][18] One of Gibson's younger brothers, Donal, is also an actor.[19] Gibson's first name is derived from St. Mel‚Äôs Cathedral, located in his mother's hometown of Longford, Ireland.[20] His second name, Colmcille,[21] is also shared with an Irish saint. Because of his mother, Gibson possesses dual Irish and American citizenship.[22] Gibson is also an Australian permanent resident.[23][24] Gibson's father was awarded US$145,000 in a work-related-injury lawsuit against the New York Central Railroad on Valentine's Day, 1968, and soon afterwards relocated his family to West Pymble, Sydney, Australia.[25] Gibson was twelve at the time. The move to his grandmother's native Australia was for economic reasons, and his father's expectation that the Australian Defence Force would reject his eldest son for the draft during the Vietnam War.[26] During his years in high school, Gibson was educated by members of the Congregation of Christian Brothers at St Leo‚Äôs Catholic College in Wahroonga, New South Wales.[27][28]",

                "content": "Troyal Garth Brooks (born February 7, 1962) is an American country singer and songwriter. His integration of pop and rock elements into the country genre has earned him his immense popularity, particularly in the United States,[2] with success on the country music single and album charts,[3] multi-platinum recordings and record-breaking live performances, while also crossing over into the mainstream pop arena.[4] Brooks is the only artist in music history to have released nine albums that were certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (surpassing The Beatles' former record of six); those albums are Garth Brooks (diamond), No Fences (17√ó platinum), Ropin' the Wind (14√ó platinum), The Chase (diamond), In Pieces (diamond), The Hits (diamond), Sevens (diamond), Double Live (21√ó platinum), and The Ultimate Hits (diamond).[5] Since 1989, Brooks has released 27 records in all, which include 17 studio albums, two live albums, three compilation albums, three Christmas albums, and four box sets, along with 77 singles. He has won several awards in his career, including two Grammy Awards, 17 American Music Awards (including \"Artist of the '90s\") and the RIAA Award for best-selling solo albums artist of the century in the U.S. Troubled by conflicts between career and family, Brooks retired from recording and performing from 2001 until 2005.[4] During this time, he sold millions of albums through an exclusive distribution deal with Walmart and sporadically released new singles.[6][7] In 2005, Brooks started a partial comeback, giving select performances and releasing two compilation albums. In 2009, he began Garth at Wynn, a periodic weekend concert residency at Las Vegas's Encore Theatre from December 2009 to January 2014. Following the conclusion of the residency, Brooks announced his signing with Sony Music Nashville in July 2014.[8] In September 2014, he began his comeback world tour, with wife and musician Trisha Yearwood, which culminated in 2017. This was followed by his Stadium Tour, which began in 2019, and another Las Vegas concert residency, Garth Brooks/Plus ONE, continuing into 2024. His most recent album, Time Traveler, was released in November 2023. Brooks is one of the world's best-selling music artists, having sold more than 170 million records.[9] Billboard ranked Brooks as the greatest male solo artist on the Billboard 200 chart of all time.[10] As of 2020[update], according to the RIAA, he is the best-selling solo albums artist in the United States with 162 million domestic units sold, ahead of Elvis Presley, and is second only to the Beatles in total album sales overall.[11] Brooks was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame on October 21, 2012,[12] having been inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame the year before.[13] He was also inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2016 with his studio musicians, The G-Men.[14] In 2020, Brooks became the youngest recipient of the Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song.[15] Troyal Garth Brooks was born on February 7, 1962, in Tulsa, Oklahoma.[16][1] He was the youngest child of Troyal Raymond Brooks Jr. (1931‚Äì2010), a draftsman for an oil company, and Colleen McElroy Carroll (1929‚Äì1999), a 1950s-era country singer of Irish[17] ancestry who recorded on the Capitol Records label and appeared on Ozark Jubilee.[18][19][20] This was the second marriage for each of his parents, giving Brooks four older half-siblings (Jim, Jerry, Mike, and Betsy). The couple had two children together, Kelly and Garth.[21] At their home in Yukon, Oklahoma, the family hosted weekly talent nights. All of the children were required to participate, either by singing or doing skits.[22] Brooks learned to play both the guitar and banjo.[23] As a child, Brooks often sang in casual family settings, but his primary focus was athletics. In high school, he played football and baseball and ran track and field. He received a track scholarship to Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, where he competed in the javelin.[20][24] At nights, he worked as a bouncer at a local bar and formed his own band, Santa Fe, learning to play whatever the college audience wanted.[25] Brooks graduated in 1984 with a degree in advertising.[24] His roommate, Ty England, later played guitar in his road band until going solo in 1995.[26] In 1985, Brooks began his professional music career, singing and playing guitar in Oklahoma clubs and bars, most notably Wild Willie's Saloon in Stillwater.[27] Through his elder siblings, Brooks was exposed to a wide range of music. Although he listened to some country music, especially that of George Jones, Brooks was most fond of rock music, citing James Taylor, Dan Fogelberg, and Townes Van Zandt as major influences.[22] In 1981, after hearing \"Unwound\", the debut single of George Strait, Brooks decided that he was more interested in playing country music.[22] In 1985, entertainment attorney Rod Phelps drove from Dallas to listen to Brooks. Phelps liked what he heard and offered to produce Brooks' first demo. With Phelps' encouragement, including a list of Phelps' contacts in Nashville and some of his credit cards, Brooks traveled to Nashville to pursue a recording contract; he returned to Oklahoma within 24 hours.[28] Phelps continued to urge Brooks to return to Nashville, which he did. In 1987, Brooks and wife Sandy Mahl moved to Nashville, and Brooks began making contacts in the music industry. Garth Brooks' eponymous first album was released in 1989 and was a chart success. It peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart, and reached No. 13 on the Billboard 200 chart. Most of the album was traditionalist country, influenced in part by George Strait.[19] The first single, \"Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old)\", was a country top 10 success. It was followed by Brooks' first number-one single on the Hot Country Songs chart, \"If Tomorrow Never Comes\". \"Not Counting You\" reached No. 2, and \"The Dance\" reached No. 1; its music video, directed by John Lloyd Miller, gave Brooks his first push towards a broader audience. Brooks has later claimed that out of all the songs he has recorded, \"The Dance\" remains his favorite.[19] In 1989, Brooks embarked on his first major concert tour, as opening act for Kenny Rogers. Brooks' second album, No Fences, was released in 1990 and spent 23 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart.[29] The album also reached No. 3 on the Billboard 200, and eventually became Brooks' highest-selling album, with domestic shipments of 17 million.[30] It contained what would become Brooks' signature song, the blue collar anthem \"Friends in Low Places\", as well as other popular singles, \"The Thunder Rolls\" and \"Unanswered Prayers\". Each of these songs, as well as \"Two of a Kind, Workin' on a Full House\", reached No. 1 on the Hot Country Songs chart.[19][29] While Brooks' musical style placed him squarely within the boundaries of country music, he was strongly influenced by the 1970s singer-songwriter movement, especially the works of James Taylor, whom he idolized and named his first child after, as well as Dan Fogelberg.[31][32] Similarly, Brooks was influenced by the 1970s-era rock of Billy Joel and Bruce Springsteen and the operatic rock of Queen with Freddie Mercury. In his live shows, Brooks used a wireless headset microphone to free himself to run about the stage, adding energy and arena rock theatrics to spice up the normally staid country music approach to concerts. The band KISS was also one of Brooks' early musical influences, and his shows often reflect this. Despite all the cited influences, Brooks stated the energetic style of his stage persona is directly inspired by Chris LeDoux.[33] In late 1990, Brooks was inducted into the Grand Ole Opry.[34][35] Brooks' third album, Ropin' the Wind, was released in September 1991. It had advance orders of 4 million copies and entered the Billboard 200 at No. 1, a first for a country artist.[18] The album's musical content was a melange of country pop and honky-tonk; singles included \"The River\", \"What She's Doing Now\", and a cover of Billy Joel's \"Shameless\". It would become Brooks' second-best selling album, after No Fences. The success of Ropin' the Wind further propelled the sales of Brooks' first two albums, enabling Brooks to become the first country artist with three albums listed in the Billboard 200's top 20 in one week.[36] After spending time in Los Angeles during the 1992 riots, Brooks co-wrote a gospel-country-rock hybrid single, \"We Shall Be Free\", to express his desire for tolerance.[37] The song became the first single off his fourth album The Chase. The single only reached No. 12 on the Billboard Top Country Singles chart, Brooks' first song in three years to fail to make the top 10.[38][39] Nonetheless, \"We Shall Be Free\" peaked at No. 22 on the Billboard Christian Songs charts through a marketing deal with Rick Hendrix Company, and earned Brooks a 1993 GLAAD Media Award.[40][41] The next single released from The Chase was \"Somewhere Other Than the Night\", followed by \"Learning to Live Again\", which peaked at numbers one and two on the Hot Country Songs chart, respectively. The album's final single, \"That Summer\", would go on to be the most successful single from the album, reaching No. 1 in July 1993.[42] Brooks released his first Christmas album, Beyond the Season on August 25, 1992. The album included classics such as \"White Christmas\" and \"Silent Night\" as well as an original tune \"The Old Man's Back in Town.\" \"Beyond the Season\" was the best selling Christmas album in 1992, peaking at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart.[43] In 1993, Brooks, who had criticized music stores selling used CDs since it led to a loss in proper royalty payments, persuaded Capitol Records to not ship his 1993 album, In Pieces, to stores which engaged in this practice. This led to several antitrust lawsuits against the record label, ending with Capitol shipping the albums to the stores.[44] Despite the delay in shipping, In Pieces was another success, peaking at No. 1 on both the Billboard 200 and Top Country Albums charts, and selling a total of nearly 10 million copies. After a delay in its worldwide release, the album also peaked at No. 2 on the United Kingdom Albums Chart. That same year, \"The Red Strokes\" became Brooks' first single to make the UK Singles Chart, reaching a high of No. 13; it was followed by \"Standing Outside the Fire\", which reached No. 23. Previous albums No Fences, Ropin' the Wind and The Chase also remained in the top 30 in the UK Albums Chart. Brooks' first world tour began in 1993, reaching the UK after many domestic concerts. Brooks sold-out venues such as Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre and London's Wembley Arena, a feat never accomplished by an American country music artist. He also began the London radio station, Country 1035. Despite the disdain of the British media, Brooks' overall popularity in the country was evident, with a top disc jockey, Nick Barraclough, referring to Brooks as Garth Vader (a play on Darth Vader) for his \"invasion\" of the charts and his success in the country genre. Unlike Alan Jackson, who refused to return to the UK after being treated in a similar negative manner by the press, Brooks would later return in 1996 for more performances.[45] Brooks also took his World Tour to other regions throughout Europe, as well as Brazil, Australia, and New Zealand.[45] In 1994, Brooks paid homage to one of his musical influences, KISS, appearing on the tribute compilation, Kiss My Ass: Classic Kiss Regrooved, a collection of songs performed by popular artists from various genres. The unlikely collaboration of Brooks and KISS' rendition of \"Hard Luck Woman\" was performed live on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, and despite its hard-rock appeal, Brooks' version appeared on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. In November 1995, Brooks released Fresh Horses, his first album of new material in two years. Within six months of its release, the album had sold over three million copies. Despite its promising start, Fresh Horses plateaued quickly, topping out at quadruple platinum.[46] The album's lead single, \"She's Every Woman\" peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart; however, its follow-up single, \"The Fever\" (an Aerosmith cover) only peaked at No. 23, becoming Brooks' first country single to not chart on the top 10. However, Brooks had three additional top 10 singles from the album, including \"The Beaches of Cheyenne\", which reached No. 1.[47] Following the release of Fresh Horses, Brooks embarked on his second world tour. Its total attendance, approximately 5.5 million, ranks third on the all-time list of concert attendance, and its gross of over $105 million ranks it among the highest-grossing concert tours in the 1990s.[48] In 1997, Brooks released his seventh studio album, Sevens. The album was originally scheduled to be released in August 1997, allowing for promotion during Brooks' Central Park concert; however, plans went awry after a dispute within Capitol Records.[46] The Central Park concert went on as planned, receiving 980,000 fans in attendance and becoming the largest concert in park history.[49] Sevens debuted at No. 1 on both the Billboard 200 and Top Country Albums charts. It later became Brooks' fourth album to reach sales of 10 million copies. The album included the duet \"In Another's Eyes\" with Trisha Yearwood, which reached No. 2 on Hot Country Songs chart, and its first single, \"Longneck Bottle\", with Steve Wariner, reached No. 1. The album spawned two additional number-one singles, \"Two Pina Coladas\" and \"To Make You Feel My Love\" (a Bob Dylan cover), which also was a top 10 hit on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart and was released on the soundtrack to the film, Hope Floats. Brooks' first live album, Double Live was released in 1998. Recorded at various shows over the course of his second world tour, the album contained new material not previously released, such as \"Tearin' It Up (and Burnin' It Down)\" and \"Wild as the Wind,\" featuring Trisha Yearwood. Peaking at No. 1 on both the Billboard 200 and Top Country Albums charts, Double Live went on to become the best-selling live album of all time, certified 21√ó Platinum by the RIAA, and is the seventh-most shipped album in United States music history.[50] In 1998, Brooks also released the first installment of The Limited Series, a six-disc box set containing reissues of his first six studio albums. Each of the reissued albums included a bonus track not available on the original release. In 1999, Brooks took on the persona of \"Chris Gaines\", a fictitious rock-and-roll musician and character for an upcoming film titled The Lamb. In October 1999, the film's pre-release soundtrack, Garth Brooks in...the Life of Chris Gaines (also dubbed Gaines' Greatest Hits), was released to much public criticism. Brooks also appeared as Gaines in a television mockumentary for the VH1 series Behind the Music, and as the musical guest on an episode of Saturday Night Live, which he also hosted as himself. Brooks' promotion of the album and the film did not garner excitement, and the failure of the Gaines project was evident mere weeks after the album was released. The majority of the American public was either bewildered, or completely unreceptive to the idea of Brooks portraying a rock-and-roll musician.[51] Sales of the album were unspectacular, at least compared with most of Brooks' previous albums, and although it made it to No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart, expectations had been higher and retail stores began heavily discounting their oversupply.[52] Less-than-expected sales of the album (more than two million) brought the project to an indefinite hiatus in February 2001 and Gaines quickly faded into obscurity.[53] Despite the less-than-spectacular response to the Gaines project, Brooks gained his first (and only) Billboard Top 40 pop single in \"Lost in You\". The album was later certified Double Platinum by the RIAA. On November 23, 1999, Brooks released his second holiday album, Garth Brooks & the Magic of Christmas. The album peaked at No. 7 on Billboard's Top 200 and No. 1 on the Top Country Albums, making it Brooks' 10th number-one album.[54] As his career flourished, Brooks seemed frustrated by the conflicts between career and family. He first talked of retiring from performing in 1992, and again in 1995, but each time returned to touring.[38] In 1999, Brooks appeared on The Nashville Network's Crook & Chase program, again mentioning retirement in a more serious tone.[55] On October 26, 2000, Brooks officially announced his retirement from recording and performing.[56] Later that evening, Capitol Records noted Brooks' achievement of selling 100 million albums in the US, celebrating at Nashville's Gaylord Entertainment Center.[57] Brooks' final album before retirement, Scarecrow, was released on November 13, 2001. The album did not match the sales levels of Brooks' heyday, but still sold well, reaching No. 1 on Billboard 200 and Top Country Albums charts. Although he staged a few performances for promotional purposes, Brooks stated that he would be retired from recording and performing at least until his youngest daughter finished high school.[56] In 2005, Brooks expressed his interest in returning to live performances; however, he remained adamant to the premise of not releasing new music until 2014. Despite this, later that year, Brooks signed a deal with Walmart, leasing them the rights to his entire catalog following his split with Capitol Records.[58][59] Brooks was one of the first musicians to sign an exclusive music distribution deal with a single retailer (along with fellow country music artist Ricky Van Shelton, who issued his 1998 album Making Plans through the chain as well).[58][60] Three months later, in November 2005, Brooks and Walmart issued an updated The Limited Series compilation, a box set containing reissues of Brooks' albums, including Double Live, and The Lost Sessions, featuring eleven previously unreleased recordings. The box set sold more than 500,000 physical copies on its issue date. By the first week in December 2005, it had sold over 1 million physical copies.[6] Brooks took a brief break from retirement early in 2005 to perform in various benefit concerts. He also released a new single, \"Good Ride Cowboy\", as a tribute to his late friend and country singer, Chris LeDoux, via Walmart.[7] In early 2006, Walmart reissued The Lost Sessions as a single CD apart from the box set, with additional songs, including a duet with Trisha Yearwood, \"Love Will Always Win\", which reached the top 25 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart.[61] The couple were later nominated for a \"Best Country Collaboration With Vocals\" Grammy Award. On August 18, 2007, Brooks announced plans for a new box set, The Ultimate Hits. The new set featured two discs containing 30 classic songs, three new songs, and a DVD featuring music videos. The album's first single, \"More Than a Memory\", was released on August 27, 2007. It debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, becoming the highest-debuting single in the chart's history.[62] In November 2007, Brooks embarked on Garth Brooks: Live in Kansas City, performing nine sold-out concerts in Kansas City at the Sprint Center, which had opened a month prior. Originally scheduled to be only one show, the performance expanded to nine due to incredibly high demand, with all nine shows (equaling about 140,000 tickets) selling out in under two hours.[63] The final concert of the series was simulcast to more than 300 movie theaters across the U.S. In January 2008, Brooks embarked on another incredible feat performing five sold-out shows (in less than 48 hours) at the Staples Center in Los Angeles for a fundraiser towards the 2007 wildfires season that impacted much of Southern California's cities and counties. The first concert (of the five) titled Garth Brooks: Live in LA was taped and broadcast repeatedly on CBS with all donations going to all of the victims and families in state of California who were impacted by the fires. In January 2009, Brooks made another one of few public appearances since his retirement, performing at the We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial concert in Washington, D.C.. In his three-song set, Brooks performed \"We Shall Be Free\", along with covers of Don McLean's \"American Pie\" and the Isley Brothers' \"Shout\". On October 15, 2009, Brooks suspended his retirement to begin Garth at Wynn, a periodic weekend concert residency at Encore Las Vegas on the Las Vegas Strip. The schedule allowed Brooks both to have the family life during the week and to continue to perform on the weekend. The financial terms of the agreement were not announced, but Steve Wynn did disclose that he gave Brooks access to a private jet to quickly transport him between Las Vegas and his home in Oklahoma.[64] Brooks' first weekend on shows in Vegas received positive reviews and was called the \"antithesis of Vegas glitz and of the country singer's arena and stadium extravaganzas\" by USA Today. The shows featured Brooks performing solo, acoustic concerts, and included a set list of songs that have influenced him. Artists covered in the show include Simon and Garfunkel, Bob Seger, Billy Joel, and Don McLean. His first performances at Encore Las Vegas coincided with his wedding anniversary, and his wife Trisha Yearwood joined him for two songs. In 2013, influenced by the set list of the Las Vegas shows, Brooks released Blame It All on My Roots: Five Decades of Influences via Walmart, a compilation album consisting of songs Brooks attributes to the development of his unique country pop genre. The box set's albums were individually certified Platinum and the compilation received a Billboard Music Award nomination. In a December 2013 appearance on Good Morning America to promote the album, Brooks also surprisingly announced plans for a world tour, beginning in 2014.[65] In February 2014, Brooks announced two concerts at Croke Park, Dublin, Ireland, to be held on July 25 and 26, 2014. Due to high demand, three additional shows were added, and a total of 400,000 tickets were sold.[66] However, due to licensing conflict, Aiken Promotions and Croke Park management were prompted to cancel two of the five concerts after conflict among nearby residents.[67] Brooks, committed to performing the five original concerts, refused to follow through with the request to only perform three, and all concerts were cancelled.[68] On July 10, 2014, Brooks held a press conference where he announced his signing with Sony Music Nashville, as well as confirming plans for a new album, world tour, the release of his music in a digital format, and remorse for the Ireland concert controversy.[8] Fifteen days later, tickets first went on sale for the world tour. On September 3, 2014, Brooks released his comeback single, \"People Loving People\", in promotion of his world tour and new album, Man Against Machine. The song debuted onto the Nielsen BDS-driven Country Airplay chart at No. 19, tying for the third-highest debut of Brooks' career.[69][70][71] On September 4, 2014, Brooks released his entire studio output on digital for the first time ever. Bypassing traditional digital music service providers, Brooks opted into releasing his albums directly his own new online music store, GhostTunes.[72] On September 19, Brooks confirmed the release date for his next album, scheduled for November 11 via a press conference in Atlanta. Man Against Machine was released via Pearl and RCA Nashville and was available online exclusively through GhostTunes.[73] GhostTunes closed on March 3, 2017. Brooks' digital catalogue moved to Amazon Music, who maintain exclusive rights over it. In September 2015, it was announced Brooks would reissue his album No Fences later in the year to commemorate its 25-year release anniversary. The release would include a new version of \"Friends in Low Places\", featuring George Strait, Jason Aldean, Florida Georgia Line, and Keith Urban singing along with Brooks. The album release has since been delayed due to royalty disputes.[74] The track was later featured on his 2016 compilation album, The Ultimate Collection. On October 13, 2016, Brooks released the first single, \"Baby, Let's Lay Down and Dance\", from his upcoming album.[75] The following week, Brooks released the upcoming album's title, Gunslinger, via Facebook Live.[76] It was released on November 11, 2016, as a part of The Ultimate Collection, a compilation album Brooks released through Target. Brooks' other project for 2016 was a duet holiday album with wife Trisha Yearwood, Christmas Together.[77] After years of royalty disputes and an opposition to online music streaming, Brooks launched a streaming channel on Sirius XM Radio.[78] He also reached an agreement to stream his entire catalogue via Amazon Music.[79] On June 19, 2018, Brooks released a new single, \"All Day Long\", the first off his 2020 album, Fun. The release also included a B-side, \"The Road I'm On\".[80] In August 2018, Brooks announced new live album, Triple Live, to be released in partnership with Ticketmaster.[81] In August 2018, Brooks announced his Stadium Tour, which will visit thirty North American stadiums and showcase Brooks in a football-centric environment.[82] In promotion of the tour, Brooks performed the first concert at the University of Notre Dame's football stadium in 2018[83] He released the second single, \"Stronger Than Me\", from his upcoming 2019 album release following a performance dedicated to his wife Trisha Yearwood at the CMA Awards.[84] On August 14, 2021, he performed his largest ever ticketed concert at Memorial Stadium in Lincoln, Neb., selling 90,000 tickets.[85] The third single from his upcoming album, \"Dive Bar\", a duet with Blake Shelton, was released in June 2019.[86] Brooks also embarked on the Dive Bar Tour, a promotional tour in support of the single, visiting seven dive bars throughout the United States.[87] During the COVID-19 pandemic, Brooks and wife Trisha Yearwood performed an informal concert broadcast on Facebook Live. The website crashed multiple times as an estimated 5.2 million streamed the broadcast. As a result of this, Brooks and Yearwood performed a concert in the same format the following week, broadcast live on CBS, along with a donation of $1 million to relief efforts.[88] The CBS special scored an estimated 5.6 million viewers.[89] On July 7, Brooks and Yearwood performed a \"part 2\" to their previous online concert, taking song requests and again broadcast on Facebook Live.[90] On June 27, 2020, Brooks performed a concert broadcast at 300 drive-in theaters throughout North America.[91] Brooks released his most recent album, Fun, on November 20, 2020.[92] On January 20, 2021, Brooks performed \"Amazing Grace\" at the inauguration of Joe Biden.[93] He said his performance was an opportunity \"to serve\" and is a \"statement of unity.\"[94][95] On April 30, 2022, Brooks performed in Tiger Stadium on the campus of Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. When he performed his signature hit \"Callin' Baton Rouge,\" he became the second person, after LSU quarterback Tommy Hodson, to excite the crowd to a degree that the noise level registered on the university's seismograph ‚Äì registering as an earthquake caused by excited fans.[96] On November 14, 2022, Brooks announced his second concert residency, Garth Brooks/Plus ONE, at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.[97] He released his most recent album, Time Traveler, in November 2023.[98] On November 24, 2023, Brooks headlined an Amazon Music Live concert special, Garth Brooks: Dive Bar Concert. The concert took place at Brooks' Nashville bar Friends in Low Places Bar & Honky-Tonk.[99] On January 9, 2025, Brooks along with his wife Trisha Yearwood performed the John Lennon song \"Imagine\" at the state funeral for former President Jimmy Carter at the Washington National Cathedral in Washington, D.C.[100] The vast majority of Brooks' recordings have used the same studio band, known collectively as the \"G-Men\". These are Bruce Bouton (steel guitar), Mark Casstevens (acoustic guitar), Mike Chapman (bass guitar), Rob Hajacos (fiddle), Milton Sledge (drums), and Bobby Wood (keyboards), along with sound engineer Mark Miller, who took over from Allen Reynolds as Brooks' producer starting with Blame It All on My Roots: Five Decades of Influences.[101] Chapman died on June 13, 2016.[102] In 1998, Brooks launched his Touch 'em All Foundation with Major League Baseball. He also began with a short career in baseball, when he signed with the San Diego Padres for spring training in 1998 and 1999.[103] Brooks' performance on the field did not warrant management placing him on the regular season roster; however, he was offered a non-roster spot, but declined it.[104] The following season, Brooks signed with the New York Mets. This spring-training stint was also a poor performance for Brooks, resulting in a zero-for-seventeen batting record.[105] In 2004, Brooks returned to baseball with the Kansas City Royals.[106] He got his first and only hit off Mike Myers during his final spring training game with the Royals.[107] In 2019, Brooks made a return to spring training, joining the Pittsburgh Pirates to promote his charity.[108] In 2005, Brooks ended his association with Capitol Records and established his own record label, Pearl Records.[109] Brooks has released four compilation albums via Pearl Records, as well as his 2014 and 2016 studio albums plus any future releases (also released through RCA Records Nashville). In 2010, Brooks purchased Jack's Tracks, a recording studio founded by Jack Clement in 1971 and sold to Allen Reynolds in 1975, where most of Brooks' albums were recorded. In 2012, in honor of his 50th birthday, Brooks renamed the studio Allentown Studios.[110][111] In September 2014, Brooks established GhostTunes, an online music store featuring his own digital music, as well as over ten million songs from other artists. The store, contracted with \"the big three\" record labels, allows for autonomous pricing and distribution format, resulting in the most proper royalty payments for artists and songwriters.[112] In March 2017, GhostTunes officially closed, merging with Amazon Music.[113] Brooks graduated from Oklahoma State University where he starred on the track and field team in the javelin throw. He later completed his MBA from Oklahoma State and participated in the commencement ceremony on May 6, 2011.[114] Brooks married songwriter Sandy Mahl on May 24, 1986. The couple had three daughters: Taylor Mayne Pearl (b. 1992), August Anna (b. 1994), and Allie Colleen Brooks (b. 1996).[115][116] Brooks and Mahl separated in March 1999, announcing their plans to divorce on October 9, 2000, and filed for divorce on November 6, 2000.[57][117] The divorce became final on December 17, 2001.[117][118] Brooks remarried on December 10, 2005, to country singer and cookbook author Trisha Yearwood.[20][24] Yearwood has included various recipes created or inspired by Brooks in her published works, including Garth's Breakfast Bowl, a breakfast dish including cheese and garlic tortellini.[119] In July 2013, Brooks became a grandfather when August had daughter Karalynn with Chance Michael Russell.[120] In 1999, Brooks began the Teammates for Kids Foundation, which provides financial aid to charities for children.[121] The organization breaks down into three categories spanning three different sports: Brooks is also a fundraiser for various other charities, including a number of children's charities and famine relief. With wife Trisha Yearwood, Brooks sang Creedence Clearwater Revival's \"Who'll Stop the Rain\" on the Shelter from the Storm: A Concert for the Gulf Coast nationwide telethon for Hurricane Katrina relief.[122] He performed the Garth Brooks: Live in LA benefit concerts, five sold-out concerts over a two-day period at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California on January 25 and 26, 2008 (setting numerous records at the high-profile venue in the process and accomplished a feat done by no other artist in music history to perform all 5 shows in a 48-hour time frame). These concerts were staged to raise money for Fire Intervention Relief Effort, serving those impacted by the 2007 California wildfires. Tickets were priced at $40 each and all five shows (totaling more than 85,000 tickets) sold out in 58 minutes. CBS broadcast the first concert live as a telethon for additional fundraising.[123] Brooks, along with wife Yearwood, has supported Habitat for Humanity's work over the years. In December 2010, Brooks played nine shows in less than a week in Nashville at Bridgestone Arena to benefit victims from the May 2010 Nashville flood. Over 140,000 tickets were sold and $5 million raised.[124] On July 6, 2013, Brooks joined with Toby Keith for a benefit concert for victims of the 2013 Oklahoma tornadoes. The sold-out show featured artists Mel Tillis, John Anderson, Willie Nelson, Trisha Yearwood, Sammy Hagar, Kellie Coffey, Ronnie Dunn, Carrie Underwood and Krystal Keith. It was held at Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium.[125] Most recently, while between legs of his world tour in 2015, Brooks performed a sold-out concert in Barretos, Brazil to benefit the Hospital de C√¢ncer de Barretos.[126] In a 1999 interview with George, Brooks said, \"But if you're in love, you've got to follow your heart and trust that God will explain to us why we sometimes fall in love with people of the same sex.\"[127][128] Lyrics to his song, \"We Shall Be Free\", features the line, \"When we're free to love anyone we choose,\" which has been interpreted as a reference to same-sex relationships.[127] Brooks won a 1993 GLAAD Media Award for the song. In 2000, Brooks appeared at the Equality Rocks benefit concert for gay rights. He sang a duet with openly gay singer George Michael.[129] Brooks' half-sister, Betsy Smittle, who died in 2013, was a musician who released her own album Rough Around the Edges (as Betsy) and was part of Brooks' band for some years. She also worked with the late country star Gus Hardin and other musicians in Tulsa. Smittle was a lesbian, and Brooks has credited her with some of the inspiration for his support for same-sex marriage.[130][131] In October 2024, Brooks was sued by his former hairstylist and makeup artist who claimed she was sexually harassed by him on several occasions. She also claimed that Brooks raped her during a trip the two took to film a Grammy tribute in 2019.[132] Brooks has denied the allegations, calling them a \"shakedown\" and an extortion attempt. He initially sued his accuser under a pseudonym in an attempt to block the allegations from coming to light.[133] In response to the lawsuit naming him, Brooks named his accuser in a countersuit.[134][135] Brooks has won a record 22 Academy of Country Music Awards and received a total of 47 overall nominations. His 13 Grammy Award nominations have resulted in 2 awards won, along with Billboard Music Awards, Country Music Association Awards, and many others. Brooks' work has earned awards and nominations in television and film as well, including the Primetime Emmy Awards and Golden Globe Awards. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2012. In 2010, he was inducted into the Cheyenne Frontier Days Hall of Fame.[136] He has also been inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame,[13] and the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum.[14] In 2020, Brooks was awarded the Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song. Age 57 at the time he was named as the Gershwin honoree, he is the youngest recipient of the award.[15] Also in 2020, Cher presented Brooks with the Billboard Icon Award.[137] In 2021, Brooks was named a recipient for the 43rd Annual Kennedy Center Honors.[138] According to the Recording Industry Association of America, Brooks was the best-selling solo artist of the 20th century in America.[139] This conclusion drew criticism from the press and many music fans who were convinced that Elvis Presley had sold more records, but had been short-changed in the rankings due to faulty RIAA certification methods during his lifetime.[140][141] Brooks, while proud of his sales accomplishments, stated that he too believed that Presley must have sold more.[140] The RIAA has since reexamined their methods for counting certifications. Under their revised methods, Presley became the best-selling solo artist in U.S. history, making Brooks the number-two solo artist, ranking third overall, as the Beatles have sold more albums than either he or Presley.[142] The revision brought more criticism of the accuracy of the RIAA's figures, this time from Brooks' followers. On November 5, 2007, Brooks was again named the best selling solo artist in US history, surpassing Presley after audited sales of 123 million were announced.[143] In December 2010, several more of Presley's albums received certifications from the RIAA. As a result, Elvis again surpassed Brooks.[144] As of October 2014[update], the RIAA lists Presley's total sales at 134.5 million and Brooks' at 134 million.[145] Subsequently, Man Against Machine has been certified by the RIAA as Platinum and listing Brooks sales as exceeding 136 million, placing Brooks again as the number 1 selling solo artist. In 2012, Brooks officially passed the Beatles as the top-selling act of the past 20 years, moving 68.5 million units worldwide, almost 5 million more than the Beatles.[146] In May 2014, Brooks' total album sales reached 69,544,000 copies, which makes him the best-selling album artist in the U.S., ahead of the Beatles (65,730,000), Metallica (54,365,000), Mariah Carey (54,280,000) and Celine Dion (52,234,000).[147] In September 2016, Brooks became the first and only artist in music history to achieve seven career Diamond Award albums, according to the RIAA (surpassing the previous tied record of six next to The Beatles).[148] On June 16, 2021, Brooks won the Pollstar award as the \"country touring artist of the decade\" (2010s). Brooks thanked his band for the companionship during all those years.[149] In 2014, Brooks was awarded the Arkansas Traveler certificate.[150] ‚Ä†Honorary former member; was scheduled to be invited, but died before the invitation was extended",

He uses rock elements in his recordings and live performances. Brooks was successful in the country singles and country album charts and later also proved popular in the mainstream pop arena, exposing country music to a larger audience.[1] Brooks has had one of the most successful careers in popular music history, with over 70 hit singles and 15 charted albums to his credit. Throughout the 1990s he broke records for both sales and concert attendance. In 1999, looking to expand his career boundaries, Brooks began a multimedia project involving a fictitious alter ego known as Chris Gaines. He started performing at bars while studying advertising in college and also working as a bouncer.[2] In 2001, Brooks officially retired from recording and performing, after having conflicts between his career and family.[1] During this time he has sold millions of albums through an exclusive distribution deal with Walmart and has released new singles from time to time.[3][4] On November 6, 2007, The Ultimate Hits was released. Brooks came out of retirement in 2007 when he opened a new arena in Kansas City, Missouri.[5] He left retirement again in 2013 to play at the Encore Casino in Las Vegas.[5]",

Country music star Garth Brooks has been accused of rape and sexual assault in a new lawsuit from a former employee. The anonymous woman, identified only as Jane Roe, worked as Brooks‚Äô hair and makeup stylist starting in 2017. In the lawsuit, filed in California on October 3, she states Brooks subjected her to unwanted sexual advances several times in 2019 and raped her in a Los Angeles hotel room that year. The woman also accuses Brooks of attempting to cover up the alleged harassment by deleting texts from her phone and filing a preemptive legal complaint against her. In a statement also from October 3, the 62-year-old musician admitted to anonymously filing the complaint in September but denied the allegations of abuse against him. ‚ÄúFor the last two months, I have been hassled to no end with threats, lies, and tragic tales of what my future would be if I did not write a check for many millions of dollars,‚Äù Brooks said. ‚ÄúHush money, no matter how much or how little, is still hush money. In my mind, that means I am admitting to behavior I am incapable of‚Äîugly acts no human should ever do to another.‚Äù Garth Brooks is a Grammy-winning country music star known the songs ‚ÄúFriends in Low Places,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Dance,‚Äù and ‚ÄúIf Tomorrow Never Comes.‚Äù His third studio effort, Ropin‚Äô the Wind, was the first country album to debut at No. 1 on the mainstream Billboard 200 chart. He is the only artist in history to have won seven CMA Entertainer of the Year awards and to have eight diamond-certified albums, having sold at least 10 million copies each. FULL NAME: Troyal Garth BrooksBORN: February 7, 1962BIRTHPLACE: Tulsa, OklahomaSPOUSES: Sandy Mahl (1986-2001) and Trisha Yearwood (2005-present)CHILDREN: Taylor, August, and AllieASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Aquarius Troyal Garth Brooks, better known as Garth Brooks, was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on February 7, 1962. His father, Troyal Raymond Brooks Jr., worked for an oil company, and his mother, Colleen McElroy Carroll, was a country singer. He grew up with four older half-siblings‚ÄîJim, Jerry, Mike, and Betsy‚Äîas well as his older sister Kelly. His brother Mike taught Garth how to play guitar, spawning his path to becoming a musician. To start, Brooks sang in bars and clubs while attending Oklahoma State University. In 1987, he moved to Nashville, Tennessee, but struggled to get his career off the ground. He worked at a local boot store to make ends meet. With help from music manager Bob Doyle, Brooks signed to Capitol Records in 1988 and released his self-titled first album the following year. His early hits include ‚ÄúIf Tomorrow Never Comes‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Dance.‚Äù Although sales for the singer‚Äôs first album, Garth Brooks (1989), were good, it would have been hard to predict the amazing success of later releases. His second effort, No Fences, released in August 1990 and spent 23 weeks at No. 1 on Billboard‚Äôs Top Country Albums chart thanks to his bar anthem ‚ÄúFriends in Low Places‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Thunder Rolls,‚Äù among other hits. Within a year, No Fences had sold more than 4 million copies before becoming Brooks‚Äô first diamond-certified album in May 1993. According to the most recent sales data, from February 2020, the album has now sold the equivalent of 18 million copies. His third album, Ropin‚Äô the Wind, raked in a record-breaking four million orders before its release in September 1991 and became the first album by a country singer to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. His 1998 release, Garth Brooks Double Live, sold over one million copies in its first week of sales, breaking the previous record. The singer-songwriter‚Äôs other hit albums have included The Chase (1992), In Pieces (1993), Fresh Horses (1995), Sevens (1997), and Scarecrow (2001). Brooks‚Äô live concerts have also been extremely successful. An August 7, 1997, concert in New York City‚Äôs Central Park drew an estimated 850,000 to 1.2 million people. In 2009, Brooks accepted a three-year stint for a string of performances at the Wynn Las Vegas. The intimate performances Brooks gave‚Äîhis set only featured himself and his guitar, as he shared personal life experiences and the importance of his family‚Äîresonated with audiences and proved to be a huge success for the artist. The country star played sold-out shows throughout the entirety of his residency. In 2011, he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the following year, he became a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame. He was inducted by George Strait, James Taylor, and Bob Seger. For his final show at the Wynn Las Vegas in November 2013, Brooks partnered with CBS for a live broadcast event. The TV special received 9.33 million viewers and claimed the No. 1 spot in the ratings for the night. Years later, the singer inked a record contract with Sony Music Nashville for his first studio album since 2001‚Äôs Scarecrow. The album, Man Against Machine, came out in November 2014. In late 2016, Brooks debuted two new projects: his 10th studio album, Gunslinger, as well as a collaboration with his wife Trisha Yearwood on a collection of holiday standards, Christmas Together. The couple hit the road on the Garth Brooks World Tour with Trisha Yearwood. The tour lasted three and a half years and sold over 6.3 million tickets, making it one of the biggest North American tour‚Äôs in history. In March 2019, Brooks returned to the road on The Garth Brooks Stadium Tour and was later honored with the Entertainer of the Year Award at the Country Music Association Awards for a record seventh time. That year, he also received iHeart Radio‚Äôs inaugural Artist of the Decade Award at the iHeart Radio Awards. Just after receiving Billboard‚Äôs Music Icon Award, Brooks released his long awaited album Fun in November 2020 after experiencing production delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic. His most recent album, Time Traveler, came out in November 2023. The singer‚Äôs 14thÔªø studio album was sold as part of a seven-disc boxed set exclusively at Bass Pro Shops. After completing his three-and-a-half year Stadium Tour, Brooks returned to Las Vegas to begin a Plus One residency at The Colosseum in Caesar‚Äôs Palace in May 2023. The residency is expected to conclude in March 2025. A&E Network‚Äôs genre-defining, Emmy Award‚Äìwinning Biography franchise released the two-part definitive documentary highlighting the prolific career of Brooks, the best-selling solo artist of all time. Garth Brooks: The Road I‚Äôm OnÔªø premiered over two consecutive nights in early December 2019. The documentary offered an intimate look into Brooks‚Äô life as a musician, father, and man as well as the moments that have defined his decade-spanning career and essential hit songs. Garth Brooks: The Road I‚Äôm On chronicled Brooks‚Äô life and career from his early days playing gigs at college bars in Oklahoma and his first unsuccessful trip to Nashville to his record-breaking world tours and balancing family life with global fame. The special highlighted the deeply personal journey and profound legacy of a genre-defining musical figure for the first time. In addition to exclusive interviews with Brooks as he told his life story for the first time, the documentary featured never-before-seen interviews with Trisha Yearwood, Billy JoelÔªø, Keith UrbanÔªø, George StraitÔªø, James TaylorÔªø, friend and original bandmate Ty England, songwriter Tony Arata, as well as many others from Brooks‚Äô personal and musical family. The documentary also showcased unprecedented access to the seven-time CMA Entertainer of the Year‚Äôs current record-setting stadium tour and delved into the stories behind his then-eight diamond-certified albums. ‚ÄúIf I was ever going to do a documentary on my life and music, I wanted A&E to do it,‚Äù Brooks said. ‚ÄúThey have interviewed all of the people who would know what the true stories are so no matter how this turns out, I can‚Äôt say it isn‚Äôt the truth.‚Äù Ôªø Brooks and country singer Trisha Yearwood first crossed paths during a demo recording in 1987. A decade later, the pair collaborated on the 1997 song ‚ÄúIn Another‚Äôs Eyes,‚Äù which later earned them a Grammy. Brooks and Yearwood wen public with their romance in June 2002 when they made their red carpet debut at the Songwriters Hall of Fame. The couple got engaged in May 2005 and married seven months later in December. Brooks was previously married to songwriter Sandy Mahl, with whom he shares three children: Taylor, August, and Allie. The couple separated in 1999, nearly 10 years after their 1986 wedding. At the end of 2000, Brooks announced he was taking a break from music to spend more time with his daughters. His divorce from Mahl was finalized the following year. The Biography.com staff is a team of people-obsessed and news-hungry editors with decades of collective experience.

They are designated by the national government. Such days include those marking the death or funeral of a renowned individual or individuals from that country or elsewhere or the anniversary of such a death or deaths, wartime commemorations, or the occurrence or anniversary of a significant disaster either in the country or in another country. Flying a national or military flag of that country at half-mast is a common symbol. Sociologically, period of national mourning are understood \"as instituting states of social exception during which state authorities enact ritual actions consisting in a sequence of choreographically staged performative acts meant to create a national community of grief in the face of what is framed as a socially meaningful loss.\"[1][2][3] The following are lists for national days of mourning across the world: A similar but rarely-used concept exists at the European Union-level and Arab League-level and are called a European Day of Mourning and Arab League Day of Mourning. The European Commission first introduced the concept on 12 September 2001, when a day of mourning was declared across EU member states for the victims of the terrorist attacks in the United States.[11] A second and third day of mourning was held in April 2010 for the victims of Smolensk air disaster in Russia and in November 2015 for the victims of the Paris attacks.[12][13] Arab League has declared days of mourning for four times until October 2023.[14][15] Besides, Other organizations such as African Union, Union of South American Nations etc also announced day of international mourning for several times.[16] While not the same as a national day of mourning, some remembrance events and protests are called a \"day of mourning\".",

Services began Saturday to honor Carter, who died Dec. 29 at the age of 100. After lying in repose at the Carter Presidential Center in Georgia, Carter's remains arrived Tuesday in D.C., where he is scheduled to lie in state at the United States Capitol rotunda ahead of funeral services. President Joe Biden declared Jan. 9 as a national day of mourning for Carter, who served one term as U.S. president from 1977 to 1981 before becoming a renowned world humanitarian. Here's what to know about a national day of mourning, including the history of the honor, what it means and what federal agencies will be closed Thursday. When is Jimmy Carter's funeral? See full schedule as remains are transported to DC this week A national day of mourning is a day to honor and pay respects to a revered public figure who has died, most commonly a U.S. president. In the case of Jimmy Carter, the national day of mourning will be held on the same day as the 39th president's funeral at Washington National Cathedral. The most recent president to be honored with a national day of mourning was George H.W. Bush after his death in December 2018. The tradition began in 1865 with a one-day government shutdown six weeks after Abraham Lincoln's assassination, according to the New York Times. While several presidents have been honored with a day of mourning in the subsequent years, others have been commemorated as well. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy were each honored with a national day of mourning after they were assassinated in 1968. President Biden, who will deliver a eulogy at the funeral, has also ordered for U.S. flags to fly at half-staff for Carter for 30 days following his death. The honor is one granted to all sitting or former presidents under a 1954 proclamation signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. For Carter, flags will fly at half-staff ‚Äì or half-mast, in the case of ships and naval stations ‚Äì until Jan. 28. That means the flags will still be at half-staff during President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs Jan. 20 inauguration. Biden issued an executive order Dec. 30 that ‚Äúall executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government shall be closed on Jan. 9,‚Äù except those necessary for ‚Äúnational security, defense, or other public need.‚Äù That means federal employees will have a paid day off. Here's a list of agencies and services that will briefly close for the day: The U.S. Postal Service said post offices will be closed and regular mail will not be delivered Thursday, although a limited number of packages may still be delivered. National parks will generally be open, but their administrative offices will be closed. Those planning to visit a national park site on Thursday are advised to check an individual park‚Äôs website for information. However, sites within Jimmy Carter National Historical Park in Plains, Georgia, will have extended hours through Thursday, according to the park service. The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq will close U.S. markets Thursday. The United States Supreme Court and other federal courts, along with the Library of Congress, will all shut down for the day. While most public schools will remain open Thursday because it is not an official federal holiday, all organizations affiliated with the U.S. Department of Defense Education Activity, including all military schools, will be closed.

This is why, for many in the Indigenous and Native American community, this date is not a celebrated beginning, but an ending of an era, and an all too brutal reminder of genocide, theft, and centuries of active violence and erasure against our country‚Äôs ancient Indigenous culture. Most of all, the day remembers the unjust treatment of the Indigenous and Native American people since that first Plymouth landing in 1620. Commemorated with events, marches, speeches, and protests, the National Day of Mourning honors the deaths of millions while also providing the catharsis of remembrance and spiritual connection ‚Äì and a call to action against the continued racism and oppression experienced by Indigenous and Native Americans today.

We are excited to announce the selection of two new student representatives to the Puget Sound Educational Service District (PSESD) Board of Directors. We welcome Maricella Gonzalez from Puyallup High School (Pierce County) and James Young from Mercer Island High School (King County) to the Board this year. Taking place on the second Monday of October each year, Indigenous Peoples Day celebrates the culture and history of the indigenous American peoples in the United States. Former Washington state Governor Chris Gregoire once said \"Show me a great school and I‚Äôll show you a great principal,\" perfectly capturing the spirit of National Principals Month, which takes place each October. Happy #SignLanguagesDay and the International Day of Sign Languages! It's a timely reminder to support greater accessibility to sign language everywhere, to make the world more inclusive for the over 70 million Deaf people across the globe. September 15 marked the anniversary of the day when the last Cherokees arrived in Oklahoma in 1838, and September 16, is the Trail of Tears Remembrance Day. The new Behavior Supports in Schools Collaborative is a multidisciplinary network for Washington‚Äôs educational ecosystem. Registration for the first quarterly meeting is now OPEN! Join us virtually this September to build connections with colleagues statewide. September is Suicide Prevention Awareness Month, offering an ideal opportunity to speak out and raise awareness on this vital topic ‚Äî an awareness that is urgently required, with suicide the tenth leading cause of death among adults in the U.S. ‚Äî and the second leading cause of death among children and young people aged 10‚Äì24. Unfortunately, these rates are increasing, and those who are young, LGBTQ, or BIPOC are especially vulnerable. LGBTQ youth are four times more likely to attempt suicide, while transgender adults, meanwhile, are almost 12 times more likely than the general population to attempt suicide. Celebrated every August 26, Women‚Äôs Equality Day provides an essential and poignant remembrance of the passage of women‚Äôs suffrage in the U.S. It is also a reminder of the heroic women who suffered violence, torture, death and discrimination as they fought for equal rights for women, including the right to vote. Created by UNESCO to memorialize the horrors of the transatlantic slave trade, Slavery Remembrance Day, also known as International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition, is observed on August 23 worldwide. Upon this day, it's important that we remember that this observance is not only a reminder of the horrors of slavery as we honor its victims‚Äîit's also about our dedication across the globe to ensure that slavery, and the racism that caused it, is abolished once and for all. Celebrated each August 14, Navajo Code Talkers Day honors the courageous achievements of the over 400 Navajo men who were recruited to the U.S. Marine Corps during World War II. Unfortunately today, K-12 Education is a declining state priority: Immediately following the McCleary ‚ÄúSolution,‚Äù more than half of Washington's general fund budget was dedicated to K-12 education. Since then, K-12 spending in the state‚Äôs general fund budget has continued to grow but K-12 education is no longer the funding priority. Commemorating the historic meeting of the first United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations in 1982, International Day of the World‚Äôs Indigenous People (August 9) provides us with the chance to promote the rights of Indigenous People worldwide, while also amplifying their voices, cultures, and accomplishments. In these days of increased concern over climate change, the knowledge and commitment of many indigenous peoples to sustainability and biodiversity may in fact prove crucial to protecting the earth for future generations. As a haunting reminder of the destructive power of the atomic bomb, August 6 is Hiroshima Day, when the city of Hiroshima holds the Peace Memorial Ceremony to mourn and commemorate the victims of the detonation of the atomic bomb in that city by the United States on August 6, 1945. Far too often, the history books seem to focus on the men who made the impacts, the men who made the achievements‚Äîand then men who looked to the stars. Yet throughout history, the eyes of women have focused on the stars as intensively as men, and to them belong many great achievements and discoveries as they played essential roles in a variety of scientific and astronomical breakthroughs. Which is why, every August 1, we celebrate Women Astronomers Day. ¬© 2022 Puget Sound Educational Service District",

It showcases a diverse lineup that includes a variety of country music, pop, rock, regional Mexican, as well as Christian, R&B and hip-hop. ‚ÄúEach season, the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo aims to bring a strong lineup of artists that reflect our Western roots while still offering an array of music that embraces Houston‚Äôs culture,‚Äù said Chris Boleman, president and CEO of the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo. ‚ÄúNine entertainers will make their debut on the star stage, alongside some Rodeo fan-favorites and hall-of-fame artists, some of which are returning for the first time in nearly 20 years.‚Äù The artists that will light up the star stage for the first time in 2025 include Riley Green, Bailey Zimmerman, Carin Le√≥n, AJR, Warren Zeiders, Grupo Frontera, Charley Crockett, Zach Top and Post Malone.

                "content": "RodeoHouston 2025 RodeoHouston is back in the saddle again and is bringing major star power to the star-shaped stage for its 2025 lineup. After drawing over 1.3 million people to concerts last year, officials revealed this year‚Äôs performers at a media event at NRG Center, next door to NRG Stadium. While the Beyonc√© rumors didn't pan out, the acts playing from March 4-23 include a variety of genres, heavily focused on country, but also including pop, rock, hip-hop, R&B, regional Mexican, and Christian music. Tickets will go on sale at rodeohouston.com on Thursday, January 16, in two waves at 10 am and 2 pm. Arguably the biggest standout is Post Malone, who makes his RodeoHouston debut on Tuesday, March 18 in what should be a massive draw. The hugely successful rap star is back in Houston after selling out two nights at Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion last fall. His turn towards country music on his No. 1 album, F-1 Trillion, featuring the No. 1 single ‚ÄúI Had Some Help‚Äù with country bad boy Morgan Wallen, and songs with Luke Bryan and Blake Shelton, was no doubt on the minds of RodeoHouston organizers. One of the longest-running rodeo favorites, Reba McEntire will open the 2025 season on Tuesday, March 4. She holds one of the organization‚Äôs highest honors as the first woman inducted to RodeoHouston‚Äôs Star Trail of Fame in 2007. This will be her 20th performance on the rotating stage and her first time back in 11 years. Other eyebrow-raising headliners include Bun B's Birthday Bonanza on Black Heritage Night (Friday, March 7). This is the fourth consecutive year that the chopped and screwed rap legend will bring his ‚ÄúInternational Players Anthem‚Äù to RodeoHouston, the 2024 edition being one of the most buzzed about shows of the year, with appearances by Drake, Nelly, Eve, Rick Ross, and others. As for who will turn up this year, let the speculation begin. Also notable is fast-rising Americana honkytonk country artist, the San Benito, TX-raised Charley Crockett, making his debut on Monday, March 17. Anyone who has caught him on small club stages in Houston as he paid his dues will find this a reason to celebrate this huge step-up in audience size. This year‚Äôs lineup is noticeably embracing a younger demographic, especially in the country ranks. Up-and-comers, Riley Green (March 5), Zach Top (March 11), and Kelly Clarkson‚Äôs favorite heartthrobWarren Zeiders (March 15) all make their debuts and are a glimpse at the future. The 24-year-old Bailey Zimmerman (March 8) achieved three consecutive No. 1 singles, including the album‚Äôs namesake, ‚ÄúReligiously,‚Äù deemed the biggest streaming country debut of all time upon its release. Outside of the country genre, streaming stars and pop-rock trio AJR fill the pop-rock role that Jonas Brothers shattered records with last year, appearing on Thursday, March 6. Mexican singer-songwriter Carin Le√≥n plays on Sunday, March 9, and two-time Grammy Award-winning contemporary Christian artist Lauren Daigle returns for her second stint on Wednesday, March 12. Rock and Roll Hall of Famers, Journey, follow-up their epic 2022 RodeoHouston performance on Friday, March 14, while Mexican-American band Grupo Frontera takes the mantle for the seat-filling Go Tejano Day on Sunday, March 16. RodeoHouston loves their established country stars and plenty will return in 2025. The reliably great Brad Paisley plays First Responders Appreciation Day on March 10 for his 17th appearance; Jon Pardi makes his third appearance in a row on March 13; country band Old Dominion headlines for the second time on March 19; country rebel Cody Jinks is back after his 2023 debut on March 20; Conroe‚Äôs Parker McCollum makes it three times on March 21. Country Hall of Famers, Brooks & Dunn, will tally their mind-blowing 22nd appearance on March 22. After nearly three weeks of performances, American Idol judge Luke Bryan will hip-swivel his way through his 12th show to close out the RodeoHouston calendar. Always aware of the many different audiences that appreciate a day on the midway, organizers have another eclectic mix of youthful names and legacy acts, ensuring that many Houstonians will have a reason to head to NRG Stadium for at least one night of music this March. Giddy up! Reba McEntire opens the 2025 RodeoHouston with her 20th appearance on Tuesday, March 4. Movie Review English pop star Robbie Williams has been massive in his native United Kingdom for over 30 years, first as a member of the boy band Take That, and then as a solo artist, with all but one of his 12 solo albums hitting No. 1 in the U.K. But somehow he‚Äôs never had a significant impact in the United States, which may mean that the new film about his life, Better Man, will be overlooked here as well. But whether you know Williams or not, the film from writer/director Michael Gracey (The Greatest Showman) is an audacious, highly entertaining treat that throws the standard music biopic on its head. The most daring part of it is that Williams is portrayed not by a series of actors, but in CGI ape form, not unlike the recent Planet of the Apes series. Williams, who does voiceover work for much of the film, says in the fourth-wall breaking movie that he asked for the look because he's felt like a dancing monkey for much of his public-facing life. And so the film follows Williams from a young age as he grows up with his mother (Kate Mulvany) and grandmother (Alison Steadman) while still idolizing his deadbeat entertainer father (Steve Pemberton). Taking inspiration from his dad, he pursues a singing career with all his heart, joining Take That at the tender age of 16. But like has happened to so many others, the overwhelming fame and his brash personality lead him down some dark roads, especially drugs. Gracey, with co-writers Simon Gleeson and Oliver Cole, hits a lot of the beats present in many music biopics: Early success, trouble adapting to fame, heavy drug use, pain stemming from childhood, and more. And while the story is familiar, the way it‚Äôs presented is not, as the usage of the ape visual allows the film to go in many wild directions. Instead of the movie occasionally tipping its hat to Williams‚Äô music, it turns into a full-on musical on several occasions in sequences that are both thrilling and informative for those who are unfamiliar with his work. Williams is heavily involved in the film, and yet unlike other artists who want to micromanage their reputations, he lets all of his warts show. It‚Äôs clear from the start that he is an in-your-face kind of person, and so even though the film often shows him at his worst, he owns up to every bit of his story. That‚Äôs not to say that movie isn‚Äôt on his side; he‚Äôs mostly portrayed as a cocky showman who‚Äôs still likable even when he shouldn‚Äôt be. It‚Äôs funny how quickly the ape gimmick goes from ‚ÄúWTF?!‚Äù to normal, which is a testament to the motion capture technology team that brought it to life. Thanks to a great physical performance by stand-in Jonno Davies and digital trickery that puts Williams‚Äô eyes on the ape‚Äôs face, his interactions with the other characters in the film never feel out of place. If anything, it adds an extra layer of joy onto a story that needs it at times. Aside from his voiceovers, how much of Williams is ‚Äúin‚Äù the film is unclear, but his irrepressible energy is felt throughout. Pemberton, Mulvany, and Steadman are all fantastic in demonstrating the Williams‚Äô family dynamic. The large cast is full of people who are not familiar to American movie audiences, but they do a uniformly great job of supporting the story. Williams may not be well-known in the United States, but movie lovers should not let that deter them from seeing this unique take on a music biopic. In fact, it probably helps if you have no distinct concept of the singer, as it allows his wild life story to be told without any preconceived expectations. --- Better Man opens in theaters on January 10.",

As per Click 2 Houston, the concert has additionally gained recognition for its fried food. The concert's official website also says that ever since the first show was held, it has left a positive impact on the livestock and entertainment industry alongside the sport of rodeo.

In the '90s, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher attended as part of the Economic Summit for Industrialized Nations. The event has drawn millions of attendees and has been held at NRG Stadium for over 20 years. The upcoming event will feature artists performing in various music genres such as pop and rock. Reba McEntire will be the headliner, marking her 20th appearance.

                "title": "Barack Obama - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Barack Hussein Obama II[a] (born August 4, 1961) is an American politician and lawyer who served as the 44th president of the United States from 2009 to 2017. A member of the Democratic Party, he was the first African-American president in U.S. history. Obama previously served as a U.S. senator representing Illinois from 2005 to 2008 and as an Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004. Born in Honolulu, Hawaii, Obama graduated from Columbia University in 1983 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science and later worked as a community organizer in Chicago. In 1988, Obama enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he was the first black president of the Harvard Law Review. He became a civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. In 1996, Obama was elected to represent the 13th district in the Illinois Senate, a position he held until 2004, when he successfully ran for the U.S. Senate. In the 2008 presidential election, after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton, he was nominated by the Democratic Party for president. Obama selected Joe Biden as his running mate and defeated Republican nominee John McCain. Obama was awarded the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize, a decision that drew both criticism and praise. During his first term, his administration responded to the 2007‚Äì2008 financial crisis with measures including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a major stimulus package to guide the economy in recovering from the Great Recession; a partial extension of the Bush tax cuts; legislation to reform health care; and the Dodd‚ÄìFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, a major financial regulation reform bill. Obama also appointed Supreme Court justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, the former being the first Hispanic American on the Supreme Court. He oversaw the end of the Iraq War; and ordered Operation Neptune Spear, the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, who was responsible for the September 11 attacks. Obama downplayed Bush's counterinsurgency model, expanding air strikes and making extensive use of special forces, while encouraging greater reliance on host-government militaries. He also ordered the 2011 military intervention in Libya to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, contributing to the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi. Obama defeated Republican opponent Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election. In his second term, Obama advocated for gun control in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, took steps to combat climate change, signing the Paris Agreement, a major international climate agreement, and an executive order to limit carbon emissions. Obama also presided over the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and other legislation passed in his first term. He initiated sanctions against Russia following the invasion in Ukraine and again after Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, ordered military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by ISIL, following the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, negotiated the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, a nuclear agreement with Iran, and normalized relations with Cuba. The number of American soldiers in Afghanistan decreased during Obama's second term, though U.S. soldiers remained in the country throughout the remainder of his presidency. Obama promoted inclusion for LGBT Americans, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to publicly support same-sex marriage. Obama left office in 2017 with high approval ratings both within the United States and among foreign advisories. He continues to reside in Washington D.C. and remains politically active, campaigning for candidates in various American elections, including in the successful presidential bid of his Vice President, Joe Biden, in the 2020 presidential election. Outside of politics, Obama has published three books: Dreams from My Father (1995), The Audacity of Hope (2006), and A Promised Land (2020). His presidential library began construction in the South Side of Chicago in 2021. Historians and political scientists rank Obama among the upper tier in historical rankings of American presidents. Barack Obama was born on August 4, 1961,[2] at Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children in Honolulu, Hawaii.[3][4][5][6] He is the only president born outside the contiguous 48 states.[7] He was born to an 18-year-old American mother and a 27-year-old Kenyan father. His mother, Ann Dunham (1942‚Äì1995), was born in Wichita, Kansas, and was of English, Welsh, German, Swiss, and Irish descent. In 2007 it was discovered her great-great-grandfather Falmouth Kearney emigrated from the village of Moneygall, Ireland to the U.S. in 1850.[8] In July 2012, Ancestry.com found a strong likelihood that Dunham was descended from John Punch, an enslaved African man who lived in the Colony of Virginia during the seventeenth century.[9][10][11] Obama's father, Barack Obama Sr. (1934‚Äì1982),[12][13] was a married[14][15][16] Luo Kenyan from Nyang'oma Kogelo.[14][17] His last name, Obama, was derived from his Luo descent.[18] Obama's parents met in 1960 in a Russian language class at the University of Hawai ªi at MƒÅnoa, where his father was a foreign student on a scholarship.[19][20] The couple married in Wailuku, Hawaii, on February 2, 1961, six months before Obama was born.[21][22] In late August 1961, a few weeks after he was born, Barack and his mother moved to the University of Washington in Seattle, where they lived for a year. During that time, Barack's father completed his undergraduate degree in economics in Hawaii, graduating in June 1962. He left to attend graduate school on a scholarship at Harvard University, where he earned a Master of Arts in economics. Obama's parents divorced in March 1964.[23] Obama Sr. returned to Kenya in 1964, where he married for a third time and worked for the Kenyan government as the Senior Economic Analyst in the Ministry of Finance.[24] He visited his son in Hawaii only once, at Christmas 1971,[25] before he was killed in an automobile accident in 1982, when Obama was 21 years old.[26] Recalling his early childhood, Obama said: \"That my father looked nothing like the people around me‚Äîthat he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk‚Äîbarely registered in my mind.\"[20] He described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage.[27] In 1963, Dunham met Lolo Soetoro at the University of Hawaii; he was an Indonesian East‚ÄìWest Center graduate student in geography. The couple married on Molokai on March 15, 1965.[28] After two one-year extensions of his J-1 visa, Lolo returned to Indonesia in 1966. His wife and stepson followed sixteen months later in 1967. The family initially lived in the Menteng Dalam neighborhood in the Tebet district of South Jakarta. From 1970, they lived in a wealthier neighborhood in the Menteng district of Central Jakarta.[29] At the age of six, Obama and his mother had moved to Indonesia to join his stepfather. From age six to ten, he was registered in school as \"Barry\"[30] and attended local Indonesian-language schools: Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi (St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School) for two years and Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01 (State Elementary School Menteng 01) for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language Calvert School homeschooling by his mother.[31][32] As a result of his four years in Jakarta, he was able to speak Indonesian fluently as a child.[33] During his time in Indonesia, Obama's stepfather taught him to be resilient and gave him \"a pretty hardheaded assessment of how the world works\".[34] In 1971, Obama returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents, Madelyn and Stanley Dunham. He attended Punahou School‚Äîa private college preparatory school‚Äîwith the aid of a scholarship from fifth grade until he graduated from high school in 1979.[35] In high school, Obama continued to use the nickname \"Barry\" which he kept until making a visit to Kenya in 1980.[36] Obama lived with his mother and half-sister, Maya Soetoro, in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in anthropology at the University of Hawaii.[37] Obama chose to stay in Hawaii when his mother and half-sister returned to Indonesia in 1975, so his mother could begin anthropology field work.[38] His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo Soetoro in 1980 and earning a PhD degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for ovarian and uterine cancer.[39] Of his years in Honolulu, Obama wrote: \"The opportunity that Hawaii offered ‚Äî to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect ‚Äî became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.\"[40] Obama has also written and talked about using alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine during his teenage years to \"push questions of who I was out of my mind\".[41] Obama was also a member of the \"Choom Gang\" (the slang term for smoking marijuana), a self-named group of friends who spent time together and smoked marijuana.[42][43] College and research jobs After graduating from high school in 1979, Obama moved to Los Angeles to attend Occidental College on a full scholarship. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to participate in the disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation's policy of apartheid.[44] In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya and visited the families of college friends in Pakistan for three weeks.[44] Later in 1981, he transferred to Columbia University in New York City as a junior, where he majored in political science with a specialty in international relations[45] and in English literature[46] and lived off-campus on West 109th Street.[47] He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1983 and a 3.7 GPA. After graduating, Obama worked for about a year at the Business International Corporation, where he was a financial researcher and writer,[48][49] then as a project coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus for three months in 1985.[50][51][52] Community organizer and Harvard Law School Two years after graduating from Columbia, Obama moved from New York to Chicago when he was hired as director of the Developing Communities Project, a faith-based community organization originally comprising eight Catholic parishes in Roseland, West Pullman, and Riverdale on Chicago's South Side. He worked there as a community organizer from June 1985 to May 1988.[51][53] He helped set up a job training program, a college preparatory tutoring program, and a tenants' rights organization in Altgeld Gardens.[54] Obama also worked as a consultant and instructor for the Gamaliel Foundation, a community organizing institute.[55] In mid-1988, he traveled for the first time in Europe for three weeks and then for five weeks in Kenya, where he met many of his paternal relatives for the first time.[56][57] Despite being offered a full scholarship to Northwestern University School of Law, Obama enrolled at Harvard Law School in the fall of 1988, living in nearby Somerville, Massachusetts.[59] He was selected as an editor of the Harvard Law Review at the end of his first year,[60] president of the journal in his second year,[54][61] and research assistant to the constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe while at Harvard.[62] During his summers, he returned to Chicago, where he worked as a summer associate at the law firms of Sidley Austin in 1989 and Hopkins & Sutter in 1990.[63] Obama's election as the first black president of the Harvard Law Review gained national media attention[54][61] and led to a publishing contract and advance for a book about race relations,[64] which evolved into a personal memoir. The manuscript was published in mid-1995 as Dreams from My Father.[64] Obama graduated from Harvard Law in 1991 with a Juris Doctor magna cum laude.[65][60] University of Chicago Law School In 1991, Obama accepted a two-year position as Visiting Law and Government Fellow at the University of Chicago Law School to work on his first book.[64][66] He then taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School for twelve years, first as a lecturer from 1992 to 1996, and then as a senior lecturer from 1996 to 2004.[67] From April to October 1992, Obama directed Illinois's Project Vote, a voter registration campaign with ten staffers and seven hundred volunteer registrars; it achieved its goal of registering 150,000 of 400,000 unregistered African Americans in the state, leading Crain's Chicago Business to name Obama to its 1993 list of \"40 under Forty\" powers to be.[68] In a 2006 interview, Obama highlighted the diversity of his extended family: \"It's like a little mini-United Nations,\" he said. \"I've got relatives who look like Bernie Mac, and I've got relatives who look like Margaret Thatcher.\"[69] Obama has a half-sister with whom he was raised (Maya Soetoro-Ng) and seven other half-siblings from his Kenyan father's family, six of them living.[70] Obama's mother was survived by her Kansas-born mother, Madelyn Dunham,[71] until her death on November 2, 2008,[72] two days before his election to the presidency. Obama also has roots in Ireland; he met with his Irish cousins in Moneygall in May 2011.[73] In Dreams from My Father, Obama ties his mother's family history to possible Native American ancestors and distant relatives of Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. He also shares distant ancestors in common with George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, among others.[74][75][76] Obama lived with anthropologist Sheila Miyoshi Jager while he was a community organizer in Chicago in the 1980s.[77] He proposed to her twice, but both Jager and her parents turned him down.[77][78] The relationship was not made public until May 2017, several months after his presidency had ended.[78] In June 1989, Obama met Michelle Robinson when he was employed at Sidley Austin.[79] Robinson was assigned for three months as Obama's adviser at the firm, and she joined him at several group social functions but declined his initial requests to date.[80] They began dating later that summer, became engaged in 1991, and were married on October 3, 1992.[81] After suffering a miscarriage, Michelle underwent in vitro fertilization to conceive their children.[82] The couple's first daughter, Malia Ann, was born in 1998,[83] followed by a second daughter, Natasha (\"Sasha\"), in 2001.[84] The Obama daughters attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. When they moved to Washington, D.C., in January 2009, the girls started at the Sidwell Friends School.[85] The Obamas had two Portuguese Water Dogs; the first, a male named Bo, was a gift from Senator Ted Kennedy.[86] In 2013, Bo was joined by Sunny, a female.[87] Bo died of cancer on May 8, 2021.[88] Obama is a supporter of the Chicago White Sox, and he threw out the first pitch at the 2005 ALCS when he was still a senator.[89] In 2009, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the All-Star Game while wearing a White Sox jacket.[90] He is also primarily a Chicago Bears football fan in the NFL, but in his childhood and adolescence was a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers and rooted for them ahead of their victory in Super Bowl XLIII 12 days after he took office as president.[91] In 2011, Obama invited the 1985 Chicago Bears to the White House; the team had not visited the White House after their Super Bowl win in 1986 due to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.[92] He plays basketball, a sport he participated in as a member of his high school's varsity team,[93] and he is left-handed.[94] In 2005, the Obama family applied the proceeds of a book deal and moved from a Hyde Park, Chicago condominium to a $1.6 million house (equivalent to $2.5 million in 2023) in neighboring Kenwood, Chicago.[95] The purchase of an adjacent lot‚Äîand sale of part of it to Obama by the wife of developer, campaign donor and friend Tony Rezko‚Äîattracted media attention because of Rezko's subsequent indictment and conviction on political corruption charges that were unrelated to Obama.[96] In December 2007, Money Magazine estimated Obama's net worth at $1.3 million (equivalent to $1.9 million in 2023).[97] Their 2009 tax return showed a household income of $5.5 million‚Äîup from about $4.2 million in 2007 and $1.6 million in 2005‚Äîmostly from sales of his books.[98][99] On his 2010 income of $1.7 million, he gave 14 percent to non-profit organizations, including $131,000 to Fisher House Foundation, a charity assisting wounded veterans' families, allowing them to reside near where the veteran is receiving medical treatments.[100][101] Per his 2012 financial disclosure, Obama may be worth as much as $10 million.[102] Obama is a Protestant Christian whose religious views developed in his adult life.[103] He wrote in The Audacity of Hope that he \"was not raised in a religious household.\" He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents, as being detached from religion, yet \"in many ways the most spiritually awakened person ... I have ever known\", and \"a lonely witness for secular humanism.\" He described his father as a \"confirmed atheist\" by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as \"a man who saw religion as not particularly useful.\" Obama explained how, through working with black churches as a community organizer while in his twenties, he came to understand \"the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change.\"[104] In January 2008, Obama told Christianity Today: \"I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian. I believe in the redemptive death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. I believe that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life.\"[105] On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views, saying: I'm a Christian by choice. My family didn't‚Äîfrankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. And my mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew, but she didn't raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead‚Äîbeing my brothers' and sisters' keeper, treating others as they would treat me.[106][107] Obama met Trinity United Church of Christ pastor Jeremiah Wright in October 1987 and became a member of Trinity in 1992.[108] During Obama's first presidential campaign in May 2008, he resigned from Trinity after some of Wright's statements were criticized.[109] Since moving to Washington, D.C., in 2009, the Obama family has attended several Protestant churches, including Shiloh Baptist Church and St. John's Episcopal Church, as well as Evergreen Chapel at Camp David, but the members of the family do not attend church on a regular basis.[110][111][112] In 2016, Obama said that he gets inspiration from a few items that remind him \"of all the different people I've met along the way\", adding: \"I carry these around all the time. I'm not that superstitious, so it's not like I think I necessarily have to have them on me at all times.\" The items, \"a whole bowl full\", include rosary beads given to him by Pope Francis, a figurine of the Hindu deity Hanuman, a Coptic cross from Ethiopia, a small Buddha statue given by a monk, and a metal poker chip that used to be the lucky charm of a motorcyclist in Iowa.[113][114] He joined Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland, a 13-attorney law firm specializing in civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development, where he was an associate for three years from 1993 to 1996, then of counsel from 1996 to 2004. In 1994, he was listed as one of the lawyers in Buycks-Roberson v. Citibank Fed. Sav. Bank, 94 C 4094 (N.D. Ill.). This class action lawsuit was filed in 1994 with Selma Buycks-Roberson as lead plaintiff and alleged that Citibank Federal Savings Bank had engaged in practices forbidden under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act. The case was settled out of court.[citation needed] From 1994 to 2002, Obama served on the boards of directors of the Woods Fund of Chicago‚Äîwhich in 1985 had been the first foundation to fund the Developing Communities Project‚Äîand of the Joyce Foundation.[51] He served on the board of directors of the Chicago Annenberg Challenge from 1995 to 2002, as founding president and chairman of the board of directors from 1995 to 1999.[51] Obama's law license became inactive in 2007.[115][116] Obama was elected to the Illinois Senate in 1996, succeeding Democratic State Senator Alice Palmer from Illinois's 13th District, which, at that time, spanned Chicago South Side neighborhoods from Hyde Park‚ÄìKenwood south to South Shore and west to Chicago Lawn.[117] Once elected, Obama gained bipartisan support for legislation that reformed ethics and health care laws.[118][119] He sponsored a law that increased tax credits for low-income workers, negotiated welfare reform, and promoted increased subsidies for childcare.[120] In 2001, as co-chairman of the bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, Obama supported Republican Governor George Ryan's payday loan regulations and predatory mortgage lending regulations aimed at averting home foreclosures.[121][122] He was reelected to the Illinois Senate in 1998, defeating Republican Yesse Yehudah in the general election, and was re-elected again in 2002.[123][124] In 2000, he lost a Democratic primary race for Illinois's 1st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives to four-term incumbent Bobby Rush by a margin of two to one.[125] In January 2003, Obama became chairman of the Illinois Senate's Health and Human Services Committee when Democrats, after a decade in the minority, regained a majority.[126] He sponsored and led unanimous, bipartisan passage of legislation to monitor racial profiling by requiring police to record the race of drivers they detained, and legislation making Illinois the first state to mandate videotaping of homicide interrogations.[120][127][128][129] During his 2004 general election campaign for the U.S. Senate, police representatives credited Obama for his active engagement with police organizations in enacting death penalty reforms.[130] Obama resigned from the Illinois Senate in November 2004 following his election to the U.S. Senate.[131] In May 2002, Obama commissioned a poll to assess his prospects in a 2004 U.S. Senate race. He created a campaign committee, began raising funds, and lined up political media consultant David Axelrod by August 2002. Obama formally announced his candidacy in January 2003.[132] Obama was an early opponent of the George W. Bush administration's 2003 invasion of Iraq.[133] On October 2, 2002, the day President Bush and Congress agreed on the joint resolution authorizing the Iraq War,[134] Obama addressed the first high-profile Chicago anti-Iraq War rally,[135] and spoke out against the war.[136] He addressed another anti-war rally in March 2003 and told the crowd \"it's not too late\" to stop the war.[137] Decisions by Republican incumbent Peter Fitzgerald and his Democratic predecessor Carol Moseley Braun not to participate in the election resulted in wide-open Democratic and Republican primary contests involving 15 candidates.[138] In the March 2004 primary election, Obama won in an unexpected landslide‚Äîwhich overnight made him a rising star within the national Democratic Party, started speculation about a presidential future, and led to the reissue of his memoir, Dreams from My Father.[139] In July 2004, Obama delivered the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention,[140] seen by nine million viewers. His speech was well received and elevated his status within the Democratic Party.[141] Obama's expected opponent in the general election, Republican primary winner Jack Ryan, withdrew from the race in June 2004.[142] Six weeks later, Alan Keyes accepted the Republican nomination to replace Ryan.[143] In the November 2004 general election, Obama won with 70 percent of the vote, the largest margin of victory for a Senate candidate in Illinois history.[144] He took 92 of the state's 102 counties, including several where Democrats traditionally do not do well.[citation needed] Obama was sworn in as a senator on January 3, 2005,[145] becoming the only Senate member of the Congressional Black Caucus.[146] He introduced two initiatives that bore his name: Lugar‚ÄìObama, which expanded the Nunn‚ÄìLugar Cooperative Threat Reduction concept to conventional weapons;[147] and the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006, which authorized the establishment of USAspending.gov, a web search engine on federal spending.[148] On June 3, 2008, Senator Obama‚Äîalong with Senators Tom Carper, Tom Coburn, and John McCain‚Äîintroduced follow-up legislation: Strengthening Transparency and Accountability in Federal Spending Act of 2008.[149] He also cosponsored the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act.[150] In December 2006, President Bush signed into law the Democratic Republic of the Congo Relief, Security, and Democracy Promotion Act, marking the first federal legislation to be enacted with Obama as its primary sponsor.[151][152] In January 2007, Obama and Senator Feingold introduced a corporate jet provision to the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, which was signed into law in September 2007.[153][154] Later in 2007, Obama sponsored an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act to add safeguards for personality-disorder military discharges.[155] This amendment passed the full Senate in the spring of 2008.[156] He sponsored the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act supporting divestment of state pension funds from Iran's oil and gas industry, which was never enacted but later incorporated in the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010;[157] and co-sponsored legislation to reduce risks of nuclear terrorism.[158] Obama also sponsored a Senate amendment to the State Children's Health Insurance Program, providing one year of job protection for family members caring for soldiers with combat-related injuries.[159] Obama held assignments on the Senate Committees for Foreign Relations, Environment and Public Works, and Veterans' Affairs through December 2006.[160] In January 2007, he left the Environment and Public Works committee and took additional assignments with Health, Education, Labor and Pensions and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.[161] He also became Chairman of the Senate's subcommittee on European Affairs.[162] As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Obama made official trips to Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa. He met with Mahmoud Abbas before Abbas became President of the Palestinian National Authority and gave a speech at the University of Nairobi in which he condemned corruption within the Kenyan government.[163] Obama resigned his Senate seat on November 16, 2008, to focus on his transition period for the presidency.[164] On February 10, 2007, Obama announced his candidacy for President of the United States in front of the Old State Capitol building in Springfield, Illinois.[165][166] The choice of the announcement site was viewed as symbolic, as it was also where Abraham Lincoln delivered his \"House Divided\" speech in 1858.[165][167] Obama emphasized issues of rapidly ending the Iraq War, increasing energy independence, and reforming the health care system.[168] Numerous candidates entered the Democratic Party presidential primaries. The field narrowed to Obama and Senator Hillary Clinton after early contests, with the race remaining close throughout the primary process, but Obama gained a steady lead in pledged delegates due to better long-range planning, superior fundraising, dominant organizing in caucus states, and better exploitation of delegate allocation rules.[169] On June 2, 2008, Obama had received enough votes to clinch his nomination. After an initial hesitation to concede, on June 7, Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama.[170] On August 23, 2008, Obama announced his selection of Delaware Senator Joe Biden as his vice presidential running mate.[171] Obama selected Biden from a field speculated to include former Indiana Governor and Senator Evan Bayh and Virginia Governor Tim Kaine.[171] At the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado, Hillary Clinton called for her supporters to endorse Obama, and she and Bill Clinton gave convention speeches in his support.[172][173] Obama delivered his acceptance speech at Invesco Field at Mile High stadium to a crowd of about eighty-four thousand; the speech was viewed by over three million people worldwide.[174][175][176] During both the primary process and the general election, Obama's campaign set numerous fundraising records, particularly in the quantity of small donations.[177] On June 19, 2008, Obama became the first major-party presidential candidate to turn down public financing in the general election since the system was created in 1976.[178] John McCain was nominated as the Republican candidate, and he selected Sarah Palin as his running mate. Obama and McCain engaged in three presidential debates in September and October 2008.[179] On November 4, Obama won the presidency with 365 electoral votes to 173 received by McCain.[180] Obama won 52.9 percent of the popular vote to McCain's 45.7 percent.[181] He became the first African-American to be elected president.[182] Obama delivered his victory speech before hundreds of thousands of supporters in Chicago's Grant Park.[183][184] He is one of the three United States senators moved directly from the U.S. Senate to the White House, the others being Warren G. Harding and John F. Kennedy.[185] On April 4, 2011, Obama filed election papers with the Federal Election Commission and then announced his reelection campaign for 2012 in a video titled \"It Begins with Us\" that he posted on his website.[186][187][188] As the incumbent president, he ran virtually unopposed in the Democratic Party presidential primaries,[189] and on April 3, 2012, Obama secured the 2778 convention delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination.[190] At the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, Obama and Joe Biden were formally nominated by former President Bill Clinton as the Democratic Party candidates for president and vice president in the general election. Their main opponents were Republicans Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, and Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.[191] On November 6, 2012, Obama won 332 electoral votes, exceeding the 270 required for him to be reelected as president.[192][193][194] With 51.1 percent of the popular vote,[195] Obama became the first Democratic president since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win the majority of the popular vote twice.[196][197] Obama addressed supporters and volunteers at Chicago's McCormick Place after his reelection and said: \"Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual. You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours. And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties.\"[198][199] The inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th president took place on January 20, 2009. In his first few days in office, Obama issued executive orders and presidential memoranda directing the U.S. military to develop plans to withdraw troops from Iraq.[200] He ordered the closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp,[201] but Congress prevented the closure by refusing to appropriate the required funds[202][203] and preventing moving any Guantanamo detainee.[204] Obama reduced the secrecy given to presidential records.[205] He also revoked President George W. Bush's restoration of President Ronald Reagan's Mexico City policy which prohibited federal aid to international family planning organizations that perform or provide counseling about abortion.[206] The first bill signed into law by Obama was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, relaxing the statute of limitations for equal-pay lawsuits.[207] Five days later, he signed the reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program to cover an additional four million uninsured children.[208] In March 2009, Obama reversed a Bush-era policy that had limited funding of embryonic stem cell research and pledged to develop \"strict guidelines\" on the research.[209] Obama appointed two women to serve on the Supreme Court in the first two years of his presidency. He nominated Sonia Sotomayor on May 26, 2009, to replace retiring Associate Justice David Souter. She was confirmed on August 6, 2009,[210] becoming the first Supreme Court Justice of Hispanic descent.[211] Obama nominated Elena Kagan on May 10, 2010, to replace retiring Associate Justice John Paul Stevens. She was confirmed on August 5, 2010, bringing the number of women sitting simultaneously on the Court to three for the first time in American history.[212] On March 11, 2009, Obama created the White House Council on Women and Girls, which formed part of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, having been established by Executive Order 13506 with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to the welfare of American women and girls. The council was chaired by Senior Advisor to the President Valerie Jarrett. Obama also established the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault through a government memorandum on January 22, 2014, with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to sexual assault on college and university campuses throughout the United States. The co-chairs of the Task Force were Vice President Joe Biden and Jarrett. The Task Force was a development out of the White House Council on Women and Girls and Office of the Vice President of the United States, and prior to that the 1994 Violence Against Women Act first drafted by Biden. In July 2009, Obama launched the Priority Enforcement Program, an immigration enforcement program that had been pioneered by George W. Bush, and the Secure Communities fingerprinting and immigration status data-sharing program.[213] In a major space policy speech in April 2010, Obama announced a planned change in direction at NASA, the U.S. space agency. He ended plans for a return of human spaceflight to the moon and development of the Ares I rocket, Ares V rocket and Constellation program, in favor of funding earth science projects, a new rocket type, research and development for an eventual crewed mission to Mars, and ongoing missions to the International Space Station.[214] On January 16, 2013, one month after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Obama signed 23 executive orders and outlined a series of sweeping proposals regarding gun control.[215] He urged Congress to reintroduce an expired ban on military-style assault weapons, such as those used in several recent mass shootings, impose limits on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, introduce background checks on all gun sales, pass a ban on possession and sale of armor-piercing bullets, introduce harsher penalties for gun-traffickers, especially unlicensed dealers who buy arms for criminals and approving the appointment of the head of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for the first time since 2006.[216] On January 5, 2016, Obama announced new executive actions extending background check requirements to more gun sellers.[217] In a 2016 editorial in The New York Times, Obama compared the struggle for what he termed \"common-sense gun reform\" to women's suffrage and other civil rights movements in American history. In 2011, Obama signed a four-year renewal of the Patriot Act.[218] Following the 2013 global surveillance disclosures by whistleblower Edward Snowden, Obama condemned the leak as unpatriotic,[219] but called for increased restrictions on the National Security Agency (NSA) to address violations of privacy.[220][221] Obama continued and expanded surveillance programs set up by George W. Bush, while implementing some reforms.[222] He supported legislation that would have limited the NSA's ability to collect phone records in bulk under a single program and supported bringing more transparency to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC).[222] In his speeches as president, Obama did not make more overt references to race relations than his predecessors,[223][224] but according to one study, he implemented stronger policy action on behalf of African-Americans than any president since the Nixon era.[225] Following Obama's election, many pondered the existence of a \"post-racial America\".[226][227] However, lingering racial tensions quickly became apparent,[226][228] and many African-Americans expressed outrage over what they saw as an intense racial animosity directed at Obama.[229] The acquittal of George Zimmerman following the killing of Trayvon Martin sparked national outrage, leading to Obama giving a speech in which he said that \"Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago.\"[230] The shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri sparked a wave of protests.[231] These and other events led to the birth of the Black Lives Matter movement, which campaigns against violence and systemic racism toward black people.[231] Though Obama entered office reluctant to talk about race, by 2014 he began openly discussing the disadvantages faced by many members of minority groups.[232] Several incidents during Obama's presidency generated disapproval from the African-American community and with law enforcement, and Obama sought to build trust between law enforcement officials and civil rights activists, with mixed results. Some in law enforcement criticized Obama's condemnation of racial bias after incidents in which police action led to the death of African-American men, while some racial justice activists criticized Obama's expressions of empathy for the police.[233] In a March 2016 Gallup poll, nearly one third of Americans said they worried \"a great deal\" about race relations, a higher figure than in any previous Gallup poll since 2001.[234] On October 8, 2009, Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, a measure that expanded the 1969 United States federal hate-crime law to include crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.[235] On October 30, 2009, Obama lifted the ban on travel to the United States by those infected with HIV. The lifting of the ban was celebrated by Immigration Equality.[236] On December 22, 2010, Obama signed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010, which fulfilled a promise made in the 2008 presidential campaign[237][238] to end the don't ask, don't tell policy of 1993 that had prevented gay and lesbian people from serving openly in the United States Armed Forces. In 2016, the Pentagon ended the policy that barred transgender people from serving openly in the military.[239] As a candidate for the Illinois state senate in 1996, Obama stated he favored legalizing same-sex marriage.[240] During his Senate run in 2004, he said he supported civil unions and domestic partnerships for same-sex partners but opposed same-sex marriages.[241] In 2008, he reaffirmed this position by stating \"I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage.\"[242] On May 9, 2012, shortly after the official launch of his campaign for re-election as president, Obama said his views had evolved, and he publicly affirmed his personal support for the legalization of same-sex marriage, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to do so.[243][244] During his second inaugural address on January 21, 2013,[199] Obama became the first U.S. president in office to call for full equality for gay Americans, and the first to mention gay rights or the word \"gay\" in an inaugural address.[245][246] In 2013, the Obama administration filed briefs that urged the Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex couples in the cases of Hollingsworth v. Perry (regarding same-sex marriage)[247] and United States v. Windsor (regarding the Defense of Marriage Act).[248] On February 17, 2009, Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a $787 billion (equivalent to $1118 billion in 2023) economic stimulus package aimed at helping the economy recover from the deepening worldwide recession.[249] The act includes increased federal spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various tax breaks and incentives, and direct assistance to individuals.[250] In March 2009, Obama's Treasury Secretary, Timothy Geithner, took further steps to manage the financial crisis, including introducing the Public‚ÄìPrivate Investment Program for Legacy Assets, which contains provisions for buying up to $2 trillion in depreciated real estate assets.[251] Obama intervened in the troubled automotive industry[252] in March 2009, renewing loans for General Motors (GM) and Chrysler to continue operations while reorganizing. Over the following months the White House set terms for both firms' bankruptcies, including the sale of Chrysler to Italian automaker Fiat[253] and a reorganization of GM giving the U.S. government a temporary 60 percent equity stake in the company.[254] In June 2009, dissatisfied with the pace of economic stimulus, Obama called on his cabinet to accelerate the investment.[255] He signed into law the Car Allowance Rebate System, known colloquially as \"Cash for Clunkers\", which temporarily boosted the economy.[256][257][258] The Bush and Obama administrations authorized spending and loan guarantees from the Federal Reserve and the Department of the Treasury. These guarantees totaled about $11.5 trillion, but only $3 trillion had been spent by the end of November 2009.[259] On August 2, 2011, after a lengthy congressional debate over whether to raise the nation's debt limit, Obama signed the bipartisan Budget Control Act of 2011. The legislation enforced limits on discretionary spending until 2021, established a procedure to increase the debt limit, created a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose further deficit reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5 trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and established automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as $1.2 trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee did not achieve such savings.[260] By passing the legislation, Congress was able to prevent a U.S. government default on its obligations.[261] The unemployment rate rose in 2009, reaching a peak in October at 10.0 percent and averaging 10.0 percent in the fourth quarter. Following a decrease to 9.7 percent in the first quarter of 2010, the unemployment rate fell to 9.6 percent in the second quarter, where it remained for the rest of the year.[262] Between February and December 2010, employment rose by 0.8 percent, which was less than the average of 1.9 percent experienced during comparable periods in the past four employment recoveries.[263] By November 2012, the unemployment rate fell to 7.7 percent,[264] decreasing to 6.7 percent in the last month of 2013.[265] During 2014, the unemployment rate continued to decline, falling to 6.3 percent in the first quarter.[266] GDP growth returned in the third quarter of 2009, expanding at a rate of 1.6 percent, followed by a 5.0 percent increase in the fourth quarter.[267] Growth continued in 2010, posting an increase of 3.7 percent in the first quarter, with lesser gains throughout the rest of the year.[267] In July 2010, the Federal Reserve noted that economic activity continued to increase, but its pace had slowed, and chairman Ben Bernanke said the economic outlook was \"unusually uncertain\".[268] Overall, the economy expanded at a rate of 2.9 percent in 2010.[269] The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and a broad range of economists credit Obama's stimulus plan for economic growth.[272][273] The CBO released a report stating that the stimulus bill increased employment by 1‚Äì2.1 million,[273][274][275] while conceding that \"it is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package.\"[272] Although an April 2010, survey of members of the National Association for Business Economics showed an increase in job creation (over a similar January survey) for the first time in two years, 73 percent of 68 respondents believed the stimulus bill has had no impact on employment.[276] The economy of the United States has grown faster than the other original NATO members by a wider margin under President Obama than it has anytime since the end of World War II.[277] The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development credits the much faster growth in the United States to the stimulus plan of the U.S. and the austerity measures in the European Union.[278] Within a month of the 2010 midterm elections, Obama announced a compromise deal with the Congressional Republican leadership that included a temporary, two-year extension of the 2001 and 2003 income tax rates, a one-year payroll tax reduction, continuation of unemployment benefits, and a new rate and exemption amount for estate taxes.[279] The compromise overcame opposition from some in both parties, and the resulting $858 billion (equivalent to $1.2 trillion in 2023) Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 passed with bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress before Obama signed it on December 17, 2010.[280] In December 2013, Obama declared that growing income inequality is a \"defining challenge of our time\" and called on Congress to bolster the safety net and raise wages. This came on the heels of the nationwide strikes of fast-food workers and Pope Francis' criticism of inequality and trickle-down economics.[281] Obama urged Congress to ratify a 12-nation free trade pact called the Trans-Pacific Partnership.[282] On April 20, 2010, an explosion destroyed an offshore drilling rig at the Macondo Prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, causing a major sustained oil leak. Obama visited the Gulf, announced a federal investigation, and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and concurrent Congressional hearings. He then announced a six-month moratorium on new deepwater drilling permits and leases, pending regulatory review.[283] As multiple efforts by BP failed, some in the media and public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government.[284] Prior to the oil spill, on March 31, 2010, Obama ended a ban on oil and gas drilling along the majority of the East Coast of the United States and along the coast of northern Alaska in an effort to win support for an energy and climate bill and to reduce foreign imports of oil and gas.[285] In July 2013, Obama expressed reservations and said he \"would reject the Keystone XL pipeline if it increased carbon pollution [or] greenhouse emissions.\"[286][287] On February 24, 2015, Obama vetoed a bill that would have authorized the pipeline.[288] It was the third veto of Obama's presidency and his first major veto.[289] In December 2016, Obama permanently banned new offshore oil and gas drilling in most United States-owned waters in the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans using the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Act.[290][291][292] Obama emphasized the conservation of federal lands during his term in office. He used his power under the Antiquities Act to create 25 new national monuments during his presidency and expand four others, protecting a total of 553,000,000 acres (224,000,000 ha) of federal lands and waters, more than any other U.S. president.[293][294][295] Obama called for Congress to pass legislation reforming health care in the United States, a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal.[296] He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, cap premium increases, and allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900 billion over ten years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the public option, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for pre-existing conditions, and require every American to carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.[297][298] On July 14, 2009, House Democratic leaders introduced a 1,017-page plan for overhauling the U.S. health care system, which Obama wanted Congress to approve by the end of 2009.[296] After public debate during the Congressional summer recess of 2009, Obama delivered a speech to a joint session of Congress on September 9 where he addressed concerns over the proposals.[300] In March 2009, Obama lifted a ban on using federal funds for stem cell research.[301] On November 7, 2009, a health care bill featuring the public option was passed in the House.[302][303] On December 24, 2009, the Senate passed its own bill‚Äîwithout a public option‚Äîon a party-line vote of 60‚Äì39.[304] On March 21, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, colloquially \"Obamacare\") passed by the Senate in December was passed in the House by a vote of 219 to 212. Obama signed the bill into law on March 23, 2010.[305] The ACA includes health-related provisions, most of which took effect in 2014, including expanding Medicaid eligibility for people making up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) starting in 2014,[306] subsidizing insurance premiums for people making up to 400 percent of the FPL ($88,000 for family of four in 2010) so their maximum \"out-of-pocket\" payment for annual premiums will be from 2 percent to 9.5 percent of income,[307] providing incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibiting denial of coverage and denial of claims based on pre-existing conditions, establishing health insurance exchanges, prohibiting annual coverage caps, and support for medical research. According to White House and CBO figures, the maximum share of income that enrollees would have to pay would vary depending on their income relative to the federal poverty level.[308] The costs of these provisions are offset by taxes, fees, and cost-saving measures, such as new Medicare taxes for those in high-income brackets, taxes on indoor tanning, cuts to the Medicare Advantage program in favor of traditional Medicare, and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies;[310] there is also a tax penalty for those who do not obtain health insurance, unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons.[311] In March 2010, the CBO estimated that the net effect of both laws will be a reduction in the federal deficit by $143 billion over the first decade.[312] The law faced several legal challenges, primarily based on the argument that an individual mandate requiring Americans to buy health insurance was unconstitutional. On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled by a 5‚Äì4 vote in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius that the mandate was constitutional under the U.S. Congress's taxing authority.[313] In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby the Court ruled that \"closely-held\" for-profit corporations could be exempt on religious grounds under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act from regulations adopted under the ACA that would have required them to pay for insurance that covered certain contraceptives. In June 2015, the Court ruled 6‚Äì3 in King v. Burwell that subsidies to help individuals and families purchase health insurance were authorized for those doing so on both the federal exchange and state exchanges, not only those purchasing plans \"established by the State\", as the statute reads.[314] In February and March 2009, Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made separate overseas trips to announce a \"new era\" in U.S. foreign relations with Russia and Europe, using the terms \"break\" and \"reset\" to signal major changes from the policies of the preceding administration.[315] Obama attempted to reach out to Arab leaders by granting his first interview to an Arab satellite TV network, Al Arabiya.[316] On March 19, Obama continued his outreach to the Muslim world, releasing a New Year's video message to the people and government of Iran.[317][318] On June 4, 2009, Obama delivered a speech at Cairo University in Egypt calling for \"A New Beginning\" in relations between the Islamic world and the United States and promoting Middle East peace.[319] On June 26, 2009, Obama condemned the Iranian government's actions towards protesters following Iran's 2009 presidential election.[320] In 2011, Obama ordered a drone strike in Yemen which targeted and killed Anwar al-Awlaki, an American imam suspected of being a leading Al-Qaeda organizer. al-Awlaki became the first U.S. citizen to be targeted and killed by a U.S. drone strike. The Department of Justice released a memo justifying al-Awlaki's death as a lawful act of war,[321] while civil liberties advocates described it as a violation of al-Awlaki's constitutional right to due process. The killing led to significant controversy.[322] His teenage son and young daughter, also Americans, were later killed in separate US military actions, although they were not targeted specifically.[323][324] In March 2015, Obama declared that he had authorized U.S. forces to provide logistical and intelligence support to the Saudis in their military intervention in Yemen, establishing a \"Joint Planning Cell\" with Saudi Arabia.[325][326] In 2016, the Obama administration proposed a series of arms deals with Saudi Arabia worth $115 billion.[327] Obama halted the sale of guided munition technology to Saudi Arabia after Saudi warplanes targeted a funeral in Yemen's capital Sanaa, killing more than 140 people.[328] In September 2016 Obama was snubbed by Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party as he descended from Air Force One to the tarmac of Hangzhou International Airport for the 2016 G20 Hangzhou summit without the usual red carpet welcome.[329] On February 27, 2009, Obama announced that combat operations in Iraq would end within 18 months.[330] The Obama administration scheduled the withdrawal of combat troops to be completed by August 2010, decreasing troop's levels from 142,000 while leaving a transitional force of about 50,000 in Iraq until the end of 2011. On August 19, 2010, the last U.S. combat brigade exited Iraq. Remaining troops transitioned from combat operations to counter-terrorism and the training, equipping, and advising of Iraqi security forces.[331][332] On August 31, 2010, Obama announced that the United States combat mission in Iraq was over.[333] On October 21, 2011, President Obama announced that all U.S. troops would leave Iraq in time to be \"home for the holidays.\"[334] In June 2014, following the capture of Mosul by ISIL, Obama sent 275 troops to provide support and security for U.S. personnel and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. ISIS continued to gain ground and to commit widespread massacres and ethnic cleansing.[335][336] In August 2014, during the Sinjar massacre, Obama ordered a campaign of U.S. airstrikes against ISIL.[337] By the end of 2014, 3,100 American ground troops were committed to the conflict[338] and 16,000 sorties were flown over the battlefield, primarily by U.S. Air Force and Navy pilots.[339] In early 2015, with the addition of the \"Panther Brigade\" of the 82nd Airborne Division the number of U.S. ground troops in Iraq increased to 4,400,[340] and by July American-led coalition air forces counted 44,000 sorties over the battlefield.[341] In his election campaign, Obama called the war in Iraq a \"dangerous distraction\" and that emphasis should instead be put on the war in Afghanistan,[342] the region he cites as being most likely where an attack against the United States could be launched again.[343] Early in his presidency, Obama moved to bolster U.S. troop strength in Afghanistan. He announced an increase in U.S. troop levels to 17,000 military personnel in February 2009 to \"stabilize a deteriorating situation in Afghanistan\", an area he said had not received the \"strategic attention, direction and resources it urgently requires.\"[344] He replaced the military commander in Afghanistan, General David D. McKiernan, with former Special Forces commander Lt. Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal in May 2009, indicating that McChrystal's Special Forces experience would facilitate the use of counterinsurgency tactics in the war.[345] On December 1, 2009, Obama announced the deployment of an additional 30,000 military personnel to Afghanistan and proposed to begin troop withdrawals 18 months from that date;[346] this took place in July 2011. David Petraeus replaced McChrystal in June 2010, after McChrystal's staff criticized White House personnel in a magazine article.[347] In February 2013, Obama said the U.S. military would reduce the troop level in Afghanistan from 68,000 to 34,000 U.S. troops by February 2014.[348] In October 2015, the White House announced a plan to keep U.S. Forces in Afghanistan indefinitely in light of the deteriorating security situation.[349] Regarding neighboring Pakistan, Obama called its tribal border region the \"greatest threat\" to the security of Afghanistan and Americans, saying that he \"cannot tolerate a terrorist sanctuary.\" In the same speech, Obama claimed that the U.S. \"cannot succeed in Afghanistan or secure our homeland unless we change our Pakistan policy.\"[350] Starting with information received from Central Intelligence Agency operatives in July 2010, the CIA developed intelligence over the next several months that determined what they believed to be the hideout of Osama bin Laden. He was living in seclusion in a large compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, a suburban area 35 miles (56 km) from Islamabad.[351] CIA head Leon Panetta reported this intelligence to President Obama in March 2011.[351] Meeting with his national security advisers over the course of the next six weeks, Obama rejected a plan to bomb the compound, and authorized a \"surgical raid\" to be conducted by United States Navy SEALs.[351] The operation took place on May 1, 2011, and resulted in the shooting death of bin Laden and the seizure of papers, computer drives and disks from the compound.[352][353] DNA testing was one of five methods used to positively identify bin Laden's corpse,[354] which was buried at sea several hours later.[355] Within minutes of the President's announcement from Washington, DC, late in the evening on May 1, there were spontaneous celebrations around the country as crowds gathered outside the White House, and at New York City's Ground Zero and Times Square.[352][356] Reaction to the announcement was positive across party lines, including from former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.[357] Since the spring of 2013, secret meetings were conducted between the United States and Cuba in the neutral locations of Canada and Vatican City.[358] The Vatican first became involved in 2013 when Pope Francis advised the U.S. and Cuba to exchange prisoners as a gesture of goodwill.[359] On December 10, 2013, Cuban President Ra√∫l Castro, in a significant public moment, greeted and shook hands with Obama at the Nelson Mandela memorial service in Johannesburg.[360] In December 2014, after the secret meetings, it was announced that Obama, with Pope Francis as an intermediary, had negotiated a restoration of relations with Cuba, after nearly sixty years of d√©tente.[361] Popularly dubbed the Cuban Thaw, The New Republic deemed the Cuban Thaw to be \"Obama's finest foreign policy achievement.\"[362] On July 1, 2015, President Obama announced that formal diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States would resume, and embassies would be opened in Washington and Havana.[363] The countries' respective \"interests sections\" in one another's capitals were upgraded to embassies on July 20 and August 13, 2015, respectively.[364] Obama visited Havana, Cuba for two days in March 2016, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to arrive since Calvin Coolidge in 1928.[365] During the initial years of the Obama administration, the U.S. increased military cooperation with Israel, including increased military aid, re-establishment of the U.S.-Israeli Joint Political Military Group and the Defense Policy Advisory Group, and an increase in visits among high-level military officials of both countries.[366] The Obama administration asked Congress to allocate money toward funding the Iron Dome program in response to the waves of Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel.[367] In March 2010, Obama took a public stance against plans by the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to continue building Jewish housing projects in predominantly Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem.[368][369] In 2011, the United States vetoed a Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements, with the United States being the only nation to do so.[370] Obama supports the two-state solution to the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict based on the 1967 borders with land swaps.[371] In 2013, Jeffrey Goldberg reported that, in Obama's view, \"with each new settlement announcement, Netanyahu is moving his country down a path toward near-total isolation.\"[372] In 2014, Obama likened the Zionist movement to the civil rights movement in the United States. He said both movements seek to bring justice and equal rights to historically persecuted peoples, explaining: \"To me, being pro-Israel and pro-Jewish is part and parcel with the values that I've been fighting for since I was politically conscious and started getting involved in politics.\"[373] Obama expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself during the 2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict.[374] In 2015, Obama was harshly criticized by Israel for advocating and signing the Iran Nuclear Deal; Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had advocated the U.S. congress to oppose it, said the deal was \"dangerous\" and \"bad.\"[375] On December 23, 2016, under the Obama Administration, the United States abstained from United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories as a violation of international law, effectively allowing it to pass.[376] Netanyahu strongly criticized the Obama administration's actions,[377][378] and the Israeli government withdrew its annual dues from the organization, which totaled $6 million, on January 6, 2017.[379] On January 5, 2017, the United States House of Representatives voted 342‚Äì80 to condemn the UN Resolution.[380][381] In February 2011, protests in Libya began against long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi as part of the Arab Spring. They soon turned violent. In March, as forces loyal to Gaddafi advanced on rebels across Libya, calls for a no-fly zone came from around the world, including Europe, the Arab League, and a resolution[382] passed unanimously by the U.S. Senate.[383] In response to the passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 on March 17, the Foreign Minister of Libya Moussa Koussa announced a ceasefire. However Gaddafi's forces continued to attack the rebels.[384] On March 19, a multinational coalition led by France and the United Kingdom with Italian and U.S. support, approved by Obama, took part in air strikes to destroy the Libyan government's air defense capabilities to protect civilians and enforce a no-fly-zone,[385] including the use of Tomahawk missiles, B-2 Spirits, and fighter jets.[386][387][388] Six days later, on March 25, by unanimous vote of all its 28 members, NATO took over leadership of the effort, dubbed Operation Unified Protector.[389] Some members of Congress[390] questioned whether Obama had the constitutional authority to order military action in addition to questioning its cost, structure and aftermath.[391][392] In 2016 Obama said \"Our coalition could have and should have done more to fill a vacuum left behind\" and that it was \"a mess\".[393] He has stated that the lack of preparation surrounding the days following the government's overthrow was the \"worst mistake\" of his presidency.[394] On August 18, 2011, several months after the start of the Syrian civil war, Obama issued a written statement that said: \"The time has come for President Assad to step aside.\"[395] This stance was reaffirmed in November 2015.[396] In 2012, Obama authorized multiple programs run by the CIA and the Pentagon to train anti-Assad rebels.[397] The Pentagon-run program was later found to have failed and was formally abandoned in October 2015.[398][399] In the wake of a chemical weapons attack in Syria, formally blamed by the Obama administration on the Assad government, Obama chose not to enforce the \"red line\" he had pledged[400] and, rather than authorize the promised military action against Assad, went along with the Russia-brokered deal that led to Assad giving up chemical weapons; however attacks with chlorine gas continued.[401][402] In 2014, Obama authorized an air campaign aimed primarily at ISIL.[403] On October 1, 2009, the Obama administration went ahead with a Bush administration program, increasing nuclear weapons production. The \"Complex Modernization\" initiative expanded two existing nuclear sites to produce new bomb parts. In November 2013, the Obama administration opened negotiations with Iran to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons, which included an interim agreement. Negotiations took two years with numerous delays, with a deal being announced on July 14, 2015. The deal titled the \"Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action\" saw sanctions removed in exchange for measures that would prevent Iran from producing nuclear weapons. While Obama hailed the agreement as being a step towards a more hopeful world, the deal drew strong criticism from Republican and conservative quarters, and from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.[404][405][406] In addition, the transfer of $1.7 billion in cash to Iran shortly after the deal was announced was criticized by the Republican party. The Obama administration said that the payment in cash was because of the \"effectiveness of U.S. and international sanctions.\"[407] In order to advance the deal, the Obama administration shielded Hezbollah from the Drug Enforcement Administration's Project Cassandra investigation regarding drug smuggling and from the Central Intelligence Agency.[408][409] On a side note, the very same year, in December 2015, Obama started a $348 billion worth program to back the biggest U.S. buildup of nuclear arms since Ronald Reagan left the White House.[410] In March 2010, an agreement was reached with the administration of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to replace the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with a new pact reducing the number of long-range nuclear weapons in the arsenals of both countries by about a third.[411] Obama and Medvedev signed the New START treaty in April 2010, and the U.S. Senate ratified it in December 2010.[412] In December 2011, Obama instructed agencies to consider LGBT rights when issuing financial aid to foreign countries.[413] In August 2013, he criticized Russia's law that discriminates against gays,[414] but he stopped short of advocating a boycott of the upcoming 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.[415] After Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014, military intervention in Syria in 2015, and the interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election,[416] George Robertson, a former UK defense secretary and NATO secretary-general, said Obama had \"allowed Putin to jump back on the world stage and test the resolve of the West\", adding that the legacy of this disaster would last.[417] Obama's family history, upbringing, and Ivy League education differ markedly from those of African-American politicians who launched their careers in the 1960s through participation in the civil rights movement.[418] Expressing puzzlement over questions about whether he is \"black enough\", Obama told an August 2007 meeting of the National Association of Black Journalists that \"we're still locked in this notion that if you appeal to white folks then there must be something wrong.\"[419] Obama acknowledged his youthful image in an October 2007 campaign speech, saying: \"I wouldn't be here if, time and again, the torch had not been passed to a new generation.\"[420] Additionally, Obama has frequently been referred to as an exceptional orator.[421] During his pre-inauguration transition period and continuing into his presidency, Obama delivered a series of weekly Internet video addresses.[422] According to the Gallup Organization, Obama began his presidency with a 68 percent approval rating,[423] the fifth highest for a president following their swearing in.[424] His ratings remained above the majority level until November 2009[425] and by August 2010 his approval was in the low 40s,[426] a trend similar to Ronald Reagan's and Bill Clinton's first years in office.[427] Following the death of Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011, Obama experienced a small poll bounce and steadily maintained 50‚Äì53 percent approval for about a month, until his approval numbers dropped back to the low 40s.[428][429][430] His approval rating fell to 38 percent on several occasions in late 2011[431] before recovering in mid-2012 with polls showing an average approval of 50 percent.[432] After his second inauguration in 2013, Obama's approval ratings remained stable around 52 percent[433] before declining for the rest of the year and eventually bottoming out at 39 percent in December.[428] In polling conducted before the 2014 midterm elections, Obama's approval ratings were at their lowest[434][435] with his disapproval rating reaching a high of 57 percent.[428][436][437] His approval rating continued to lag throughout most of 2015 but began to reach the high 40s by the end of the year.[428][438] According to Gallup, Obama's approval rating reached 50 percent in March 2016, a level unseen since May 2013.[428][439] In polling conducted January 16‚Äì19, 2017, Obama's final approval rating was 59 percent, which placed him on par with George H. W. Bush and Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose final Gallup ratings also measured in the high 50s.[440] Obama has maintained relatively positive public perceptions after his presidency.[441] In Gallup's retrospective approval polls of former presidents, Obama garnered a 63 percent approval rating in 2018 and again in 2023, ranking him the fourth most popular president since World War II.[442][443] Polls showed strong support for Obama in other countries both before and during his presidency.[444][445][446] In a February 2009 poll conducted in Western Europe and the U.S. by Harris Interactive for France 24 and the International Herald Tribune, Obama was rated as the most respected world leader, as well as the most powerful.[447] In a similar poll conducted by Harris in May 2009, Obama was rated as the most popular world leader, as well as the one figure most people would pin their hopes on for pulling the world out of the economic downturn.[448][449] On October 9, 2009‚Äîonly nine months into his first term‚Äîthe Norwegian Nobel Committee announced that Obama had won the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize \"for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples\",[450] which drew a mixture of praise and criticism from world leaders and media figures.[451][452][453][454] He became the fourth U.S. president to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and the third to become a Nobel laureate while in office.[455] He himself called it a \"call to action\" and remarked: \"I do not view it as a recognition of my own accomplishments but rather an affirmation of American leadership on behalf of aspirations held by people in all nations\".[456] In 2009 the saying \"thanks, Obama\" first appeared in a Twitter hashtag \"#thanks Obama\" and was later used in a demotivational poster. It was later adopted satirically to blame Obama for any socio-economic ills. Obama himself used the phrase in video in 2015 and 2016. In 2017 the phrase was used by Stephen Colbert to express gratitude to Obama on his last day in office. In 2022, President Joe Biden's Twitter account posted the phrase. Obama's presidency ended on January 20, 2017, upon the inauguration of his successor, Donald Trump.[457][458] The family moved to a house they rented in Kalorama, Washington, D.C.[459] On March 2, the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum awarded the Profile in Courage Award to Obama \"for his enduring commitment to democratic ideals and elevating the standard of political courage.\"[460] His first public appearance since leaving the office was a seminar at the University of Chicago on April 24, where he appealed for a new generation to participate in politics.[461] On September 7, Obama partnered with former presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities.[462] From October 31 to November 1, Obama hosted the inaugural summit of the Obama Foundation,[463] which he intended to be the central focus of his post-presidency and part of his ambitions for his subsequent activities following his presidency to be more consequential than his time in office.[464] Barack and Michelle Obama signed a deal on May 22, 2018, to produce docu-series, documentaries and features for Netflix under the Obamas' newly formed production company, Higher Ground Productions.[465][466] Higher Ground's first film, American Factory, won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 2020.[467] On October 24, a pipe bomb addressed to Obama was intercepted by the Secret Service. It was one of several pipe-bombs that had been mailed out to Democratic lawmakers and officials.[468] In 2019, Barack and Michelle Obama bought a home on Martha's Vineyard from Wyc Grousbeck.[469] On October 29, Obama criticized \"wokeness\" and call-out culture at the Obama Foundation's annual summit.[470][471] Obama was reluctant to make an endorsement in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries because he wanted to position himself to unify the party, regardless of the nominee.[472] On April 14, 2020, Obama endorsed Biden, the presumptive nominee, for president in the presidential election, stating that he has \"all the qualities we need in a president right now.\"[473][474] In May, Obama criticized President Trump for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, calling his response to the crisis \"an absolute chaotic disaster\", and stating that the consequences of the Trump presidency have been \"our worst impulses unleashed, our proud reputation around the world badly diminished, and our democratic institutions threatened like never before.\"[475] On November 17, Obama's presidential memoir, A Promised Land, was released.[476][477][478] In February 2021, Obama and musician Bruce Springsteen started a podcast called Renegades: Born in the USA where the two talk about \"their backgrounds, music and their 'enduring love of America.'\"[479][480] Later that year, Regina Hicks had signed a deal with Netflix, in a venture with his and Michelle's Higher Ground to develop comedy projects.[481] On March 4, 2022, Obama won an Audio Publishers Association (APA) Award in the best narration by the author category for the narration of his memoir A Promised Land.[482] On April 5, Obama visited the White House for the first time since leaving office, in an event celebrating the 12th annual anniversary of the signing of the Affordable Care Act.[483][484][485] In June, it was announced that the Obamas and their podcast production company, Higher Ground, signed a multi-year deal with Audible.[486][487] In September, Obama visited the White House to unveil his and Michelle's official White House portraits.[488] Around the same time, he won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Narrator[489] for his narration in the Netflix documentary series Our Great National Parks.[490] In 2022, Obama opposed expanding the Supreme Court beyond the present nine Justices.[491] In March 2023, Obama traveled to Australia as a part of his speaking tour of the country. During the trip, Obama met with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and visited Melbourne for the first time.[492] Obama was reportedly paid more than $1 million for two speeches.[493][494] In October 2023, during the Israel‚ÄìHamas war, Obama declared that Israel must dismantle Hamas in the wake of the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel.[495] Weeks later, Obama warned Israel that its actions could \"harden Palestinian attitudes for generations\" and weaken international support for Israel; any military strategy that ignored the war's human costs \"could ultimately backfire.\"[496] In July 2024, Obama expressed concerns about Biden's campaign viability after his critically maligned debate performance against former president Trump.[497] On July 21, Biden withdrew his candidacy and swiftly endorsed Vice President Harris right after to run as the Democratic nominee. Obama endorsed Harris alongside his wife Michelle five days later and delivered a critically acclaimed speech at the 2024 Democratic National Convention formally endorsing her.[498] He joined Harris on the campaign trail in October, traveling to various swing states and emphasizing her record as a prosecutor, Senator, and Vice President and advocating for increased voter turnout, and his criticisms of Donald Trump and the Republican Party were widely reported by various media outlets.[499][500] After Trump was declared the winner of the election on November 6, Obama and Michelle congratulated him and Vice President-elect JD Vance while praising the Harris campaign and calling on liberal voters to continue supporting democracy and human rights.[501] Obama has been described as one of the most effective campaigners in American history (his 2008 campaign being particularly highlighted) as well as one of the most talented political orators of the 21st century.[502][503][504] Historian Julian Zelizer credits Obama with \"a keen sense of how the institutions of government work and the ways that his team could design policy proposals.\" Zeitzer notes Obama's policy successes included the economic stimulus package which ended the Great Recession and the Dodd-Frank financial and consumer protection reforms, as well as the Affordable Care Act. Zeitzer also notes the Democratic Party lost power and numbers of elected officials during Obama's term, saying that the consensus among historians is that Obama \"turned out to be a very effective policymaker but not a tremendously successful party builder.\" Zeitzer calls this the \"defining paradox of Obama's presidency\".[505] The Brookings Institution noted that Obama passed \"only one major legislative achievement (Obamacare)‚Äîand a fragile one at that‚Äîthe legacy of Obama's presidency mainly rests on its tremendous symbolic importance and the fate of a patchwork of executive actions.\"[506] David W. Wise noted that Obama fell short \"in areas many Progressives hold dear\", including the continuation of drone strikes, not going after big banks during the Great Recession, and failing to strengthen his coalition before pushing for Obamacare. Wise called Obama's legacy that of \"a disappointingly conventional president\".[507] Obama's most significant accomplishment is generally considered to be the Affordable Care Act (ACA), provisions of which went into effect from 2010 to 2020. Many attempts by Senate Republicans to repeal the ACA, including a \"skinny repeal\", have thus far failed.[508] However, in 2017, the penalty for violating the individual mandate was repealed effective 2019.[509] Together with the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act amendment, it represents the U.S. healthcare system's most significant regulatory overhaul and expansion of coverage since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965.[510][511][512][513] Many commentators credit Obama with averting a threatened depression and pulling the economy back from the Great Recession.[508] According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Obama administration created 11.3 million jobs from the month after his first inauguration to the end of his second term.[514] In 2010, Obama signed into effect the Dodd‚ÄìFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Passed as a response to the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, it brought the most significant changes to financial regulation in the United States since the regulatory reform that followed the Great Depression under Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt.[515] In 2009, Obama signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, which contained in it the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, the first addition to existing federal hate crime law in the United States since Democratic President Bill Clinton signed into law the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996. The act expanded existing federal hate crime laws in the United States, and made it a federal crime to assault people based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.[516] As president, Obama advanced LGBT rights.[517] In 2010, he signed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act, which brought an end to \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy in the U.S. armed forces that banned open service from LGBT people; the law went into effect the following year.[518] In 2016, his administration brought an end to the ban on transgender people serving openly in the U.S. armed forces.[519][239] A Gallup poll, taken in the final days of Obama's term, showed that 68 percent of Americans believed the U.S. had made progress on LGBT rights during Obama's eight years in office.[520] Obama substantially escalated the use of drone strikes against suspected militants and terrorists associated with al-Qaeda and the Taliban.[521] In 2016, the last year of his presidency, the U.S. dropped 26,171 bombs on seven different countries.[522][523] Obama left about 8,400 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, 5,262 in Iraq, 503 in Syria, 133 in Pakistan, 106 in Somalia, seven in Yemen, and two in Libya at the end of his presidency.[524] According to Pew Research Center and United States Bureau of Justice Statistics, from December 31, 2009, to December 31, 2015, inmates sentenced in U.S. federal custody declined by five percent. This is the largest decline in sentenced inmates in U.S. federal custody since Democratic President Jimmy Carter. By contrast, the federal prison population increased significantly under presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush.[525] Human Rights Watch (HRW) called Obama's human rights record \"mixed\", adding that \"he has often treated human rights as a secondary interest‚Äînice to support when the cost was not too high, but nothing like a top priority he championed.\"[222] Obama left office in January 2017 with a 60 percent approval rating.[526][527] He gained 10 spots from the same survey in 2015 from the Brookings Institution that ranked him the 18th-greatest American president.[528] In Gallup's 2018 job approval poll for the past 10 U.S. presidents, he received a 63 percent approval rating.[529] The Barack Obama Presidential Center is Obama's planned presidential library. It will be hosted by the University of Chicago and located in Jackson Park on the South Side of Chicago.[530] Obama received the Norwegian Nobel Committee's Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, The Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education's Ambassador of Humanity Award in 2014, the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award in 2017, and the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights Ripple of Hope Award in 2018. He was named TIME Magazine's Time Person of the Year in 2008 and 2012. He also received two Grammy Awards for Best Spoken Word Album for Dreams from My Father (2006), and The Audacity of Hope (2008) as well as two Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Narrator for Our Great National Parks (2022), and Working: What We Do All Day (2023). He also won two Children's and Family Emmy Awards.",

                "content": "Barack Hussein Obama II was born August 4, 1961, in Honolulu, Hawaii, to parents Barack H. Obama, Sr., and Stanley Ann Dunham. His parents divorced when he was 2 years old and he was raised by his mother, Ann, and maternal grandparents, Stanley and Madelyn Dunham. His mother later married Lolo Soetoro, and his sister Maya was born in 1970. (He also has several siblings on his father‚Äôs side.) Obama moved with his family to Indonesia in 1967, where he attended local Indonesian schools and received additional lessons via U.S. correspondence courses under his mother‚Äôs direction. He returned to Hawaii to live with his grandparents in 1971 and attended Punahou School, from which he graduated in 1979. Obama first attended Occidental College in Los Angeles, before transferring to Columbia University, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1983. After graduation, Obama briefly worked as an analyst at Business International Corporation in New York City, before changing his career direction toward community service organizing. He relocated to Chicago, Illinois, in 1985 when he accepted a job with the Developing Communities Project. Eventually rising to the role of Director, Obama worked with low-income communities on Chicago‚Äôs South Side, often collaborating with local religious organizations and civic groups. After three years of community organizing, Obama enrolled in Harvard Law School. After completing his first year, he worked as a summer associate at Chicago corporate law firm of Sidley & Austin, where his mentor was Michelle Robinson, his future wife. Obama was elected the first African-American president of the Harvard Law Review, prior to graduating magna cum laude in 1991. He returned to Chicago in 1992 and served as the Illinois Executive Director of PROJECT VOTE!. In 1993, he was hired as an associate at the firm of Davis Miner Barnhill & Gallard, where he largely worked on voting rights cases. Barack Obama and Michelle Robinson were married in 1992 at Chicago‚Äôs Trinity United Church of Christ. They have two daughters, Malia and Natasha ‚ÄúSasha.‚Äù In the summer of 1995, Obama‚Äôs first book was published. Dreams From My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance detailed his personal history and search for identity. In 1996, Obama was elected to the Illinois State Senate from the thirteenth district. As a State Senator, he served as Democratic Spokesperson for Public Health and Welfare Committee and Co-Chairman of the Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, in addition to being a member of the Judiciary and Revenue Committees. He also worked as a Senior Lecturer at the University of Chicago from 1996 until 2004, teaching three courses per year. Obama was elected to a second term in the Illinois State Senate in November 1998. In 2000, Obama made his first run for the U.S. Congress when he sought the Democratic U.S. House seat in Illinois First District. He lost to incumbent Representative Bobby Rush by a margin of more than 2-to-1. In July 2004, Obama delivered the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, held in Boston, Massachusetts. He was elected as the junior Senator from Illinois in November 2004. While serving as U.S. Senator from Illinois, Obama completed his second book, The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream, published in October 2006. On February 10, 2007, Obama formally announced his candidacy for President of the United States. He accepted the Democratic Party‚Äôs nomination at Invesco Stadium in Denver, Colorado on August 28, 2008. On November 4, 2008, Obama became the first African-American to be elected President. He resigned his seat in the U.S. Senate on November 16, 2008. Barack Obama was inaugurated as the 44th President of the United States on January 20, 2009. Domestic policy decisions dominated the first 100 Days of the Obama administration. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which encourages fair pay for all workers and established new methods of protesting unfair paychecks, was the first signed legislation of the administration. To combat the effects of the Great Recession, President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (known as the Recovery Act) in February 2009, which outlined a policy to create additional jobs, extend unemployment benefits, and established the President‚Äôs Economic Recovery Advisory Board. In March 2010, after announcing his intent for healthcare reform in a 2009 address to Congress, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act (also known as ‚ÄúObamacare‚Äù), establishing the most sweeping reforms of the American healthcare system in recent history. To improve access to healthcare coverage, the Act included a Patient‚Äôs Bill of Rights to end discrimination by insurance companies based on pre-existing conditions. Among its other reforms, the Act strengthened Medicare and required the insurer to cover preventative screenings for cancer, diabetes, and blood pressure disorders. The Obama administration centered its foreign policy on drawing down the number of American forces stationed overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan. President Obama also committed to destroying the ISIL (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) terrorist organization through the administration‚Äôs comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy, including systematic airstrikes against ISIL, providing additional support to forces fighting ISIL on the ground, increased cooperation with counter-terrorism partners, and humanitarian assistance to civilians. On May 2, 2011, President Obama announced to the nation that the United States had conducted an operation that resulted in the death of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Following leads from the intelligence community, the raid on bin Laden‚Äôs Abbottabad compound was conducted with no American casualties. President Obama also obtained congressional approval for military action against Syria following the Syrian regime‚Äôs use of chemical weapons on civilians. Negotiations with Russia led to the signing of a New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) Treaty, which limited the two countries to fewer strategic arms over the course of seven years through inspections and verification. In 2015, the U.S. and other partners reached a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran, which aimed to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and committed Iran to further monitoring of all Iranian nuclear activities. President Obama announced plans to normalize foreign relations with Cuba in conjunction with President Castro, including reopening the U.S. Embassy in Havana in July 2015. The First Family visited Cuba in March 2016, making President Obama the first sitting President to visit the nation in 90 years. President and Mrs. Obama returned to their lives as private citizens on January 20, 2017.",

Barack Obama served as the 44th President of the United States. His story is the American story ‚Äî values from the heartland, a middle-class upbringing in a strong family, hard work and education as the means of getting ahead, and the conviction that a life so blessed should be lived in service to others. When Barack Obama was elected president in 2008, he became the first African American to hold the office. The framers of the Constitution always hoped that our leadership would not be limited to Americans of wealth or family connections. Subject to the prejudices of their time‚Äîmany of them owned slaves‚Äîmost would not have foreseen an African American president. Obama‚Äôs father, Barack Sr., a Kenyan economist, met his mother, Stanley Ann Dunham, when both were students in Hawaii, where Barack was born on August 4, 1961. They later divorced, and Barack‚Äôs mother married a man from Indonesia, where he spent his early childhood. Before fifth grade, he returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents and attend Punahou School on scholarship. In his memoir Dreams from My Father (1995), Obama describes the complexities of discovering his identity in adolescence. After two years at Occidental College in Los Angeles, he transferred to Columbia University, where he studied political science and international relations. Following graduation in 1983, Obama worked in New York City, then became a community organizer on the South Side of Chicago, coordinating with churches to improve housing conditions and set up job-training programs in a community hit hard by steel mill closures. In 1988, he went to Harvard Law School, where he attracted national attention as the first African American president of the Harvard Law Review. Returning to Chicago, he joined a small law firm specializing in civil rights. In 1992, Obama married Michelle Robinson, a lawyer who had also excelled at Harvard Law. Their daughters, Malia and Sasha, were born in 1998 and 2001, respectively. Obama was elected to the Illinois Senate in 1996, and then to the U.S. Senate in 2004. At the Democratic National Convention that summer, he delivered a much acclaimed keynote address. Some pundits instantly pronounced him a future president, but most did not expect it to happen for some time. Nevertheless, in 2008 he was elected over Arizona Senator John McCain by 365 to 173 electoral votes. As an incoming president, Obama faced many challenges‚Äîan economic collapse, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the continuing menace of terrorism. Inaugurated before an estimated crowd of 1.8 million people, Obama proposed unprecedented federal spending to revive the economy and also hoped to renew America‚Äôs stature in the world. During his first term he signed three signature bills: an omnibus bill to stimulate the economy, legislation making health care more accessible and affordable, and legislation reforming the nation‚Äôs financial institutions. Obama also pressed for a fair pay act for women, financial reform legislation, and efforts for consumer protection. In 2009, Obama became the fourth president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. In 2012, he was reelected over former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney by 332 to 206 electoral votes. The Middle East remained a key foreign policy challenge. Obama had overseen the killing of Osama bin Laden, but a new self-proclaimed Islamic State arose during a civil war in Syria and began inciting terrorist attacks. Obama sought to manage a hostile Iran with a treaty that hindered its development of nuclear weapons. The Obama administration also adopted a climate change agreement signed by 195 nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow global warming. In the last year of his second term, Obama spoke at two events that clearly moved him‚Äîthe 50th anniversary of the civil rights march from Selma to Montgomery, and the dedication of the National Museum of African American History and Culture. ‚ÄúOur union is not yet perfect, but we are getting closer,‚Äù he said in Selma. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs why we celebrate,‚Äù he told those attending the museum opening in Washington, ‚Äúmindful that our work is not yet done.‚Äù Learn more about Barack Obama‚Äôs spouse, Michelle Obama.

His father, Barack Obama, Sr., a Kenyan, became an economist in the government of Kenya. His mother, S. Ann Dunham, became an anthropologist. They divorced in 1964. Ann then married (and later divorced) another foreign student, Indonesian Lolo Soetoro. Barack Obama graduated from Punahou School, an elite academy in Honolulu, and then attended Occidental College before transferring to Columbia University and earning (1983) a B.A. in political science. He graduated (1991) magna cum laude from Harvard University‚Äôs law school and was the first African American president of the Harvard Law Review. After working as a writer and editor in Manhattan, Barack Obama became a community organizer in Chicago, lectured on constitutional law at the University of Chicago, worked as a civil rights attorney, and then served in the Illinois Senate (1997‚Äì2004), as a U.S. senator (2005‚Äì08), and as U.S. president (2009‚Äì17). Barack Obama‚Äôs first book, Dreams from My Father (1995), is the story of his search for his biracial identity by tracing the lives of his now-deceased father and extended family in Kenya. His second book, The Audacity of Hope (2006), is a polemic on his vision for the United States. Barack Obama was the first African American president of the United States (2009‚Äì17). He oversaw the recovery of the U.S. economy (from the Great Recession of 2008‚Äì09) and the enactment of landmark health care reform (the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act). In 2009 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Whether DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) and the DREAM Act, supported by Barack Obama, are good for America is widely debated. Some say the policies are are good for the U.S. economy and deporting Dreamers is cruel. Others say the policies only encourage more illegal immigration and amnesty should not be given to law breakers. For more on the Dreamer debate, visit ProCon.org. Barack Obama (born August 4, 1961, Honolulu, Hawaii, U.S.) is the 44th president of the United States (2009‚Äì17) and the first African American to hold the office. Before winning the presidency, Obama represented Illinois in the U.S. Senate (2005‚Äì08). He was the third African American to be elected to that body since the end of Reconstruction (1877). In 2009 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize ‚Äúfor his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.‚Äù Obama‚Äôs father, Barack Obama, Sr., was a teenage goatherd in rural Kenya, won a scholarship to study in the United States, and eventually became a senior economist in the Kenyan government. Obama‚Äôs mother, S. Ann Dunham, grew up in Kansas, Texas, and Washington state before her family settled in Honolulu. In 1960 she and Barack Sr. met in a Russian language class at the University of Hawaii and married less than a year later. When Obama was age two, Barack Sr. left to study at Harvard University; shortly thereafter, in 1964, Ann and Barack Sr. divorced. (Obama saw his father only one more time, during a brief visit when Obama was 10.) Later Ann remarried, this time to another foreign student, Lolo Soetoro from Indonesia, with whom she had a second child, Maya. Obama lived for several years in Jakarta with his half sister, mother, and stepfather. While there, Obama attended both a government-run school where he received some instruction in Islam and a Catholic private school where he took part in Christian schooling. He returned to Hawaii in 1971 and lived in a modest apartment, sometimes with his grandparents and sometimes with his mother (she remained for a time in Indonesia, returned to Hawaii, and then went abroad again‚Äîpartly to pursue work on a Ph.D.‚Äîbefore divorcing Soetoro in 1980). For a brief period his mother was aided by government food stamps, but the family mostly lived a middle-class existence. In 1979 Obama graduated from Punahou School, an elite college preparatory academy in Honolulu. Obama attended Occidental College in suburban Los Angeles for two years and then transferred to Columbia University in New York City, where in 1983 he received a bachelor‚Äôs degree in political science. Influenced by professors who pushed him to take his studies more seriously, Obama experienced great intellectual growth during college and for a couple of years thereafter. He led a rather ascetic life and read works of literature and philosophy by William Shakespeare, Friedrich Nietzsche, Toni Morrison, and others. After serving for a couple of years as a writer and editor for Business International Corp., a research, publishing, and consulting firm in Manhattan, he took a position in 1985 as a community organizer on Chicago‚Äôs largely impoverished Far South Side. He returned to school three years later and graduated magna cum laude in 1991 from Harvard University‚Äôs law school, where he was the first African American to serve as president of the Harvard Law Review. While a summer associate in 1989 at the Chicago law firm of Sidley Austin, Obama had met Chicago native Michelle Robinson, a young lawyer at the firm. The two married in 1992. After receiving his law degree, Obama moved to Chicago and became active in the Democratic Party. He organized Project Vote, a drive that registered tens of thousands of African Americans on voting rolls and that is credited with helping Democrat Bill Clinton win Illinois and capture the presidency in 1992. The effort also helped make Carol Moseley Braun, an Illinois state legislator, the first African American woman elected to the U.S. Senate. During this period, Obama wrote his first book and saw it published. The memoir, Dreams from My Father (1995), is the story of Obama‚Äôs search for his biracial identity by tracing the lives of his now-deceased father and his extended family in Kenya. Obama lectured on constitutional law at the University of Chicago and worked as an attorney on civil rights issues.",
