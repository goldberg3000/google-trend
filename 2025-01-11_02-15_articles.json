                "content": "An earthquake – also called a quake, tremor, or temblor – is the shaking of the Earth's surface resulting from a sudden release of energy in the lithosphere that creates seismic waves. Earthquakes can range in intensity, from those so weak they cannot be felt, to those violent enough to propel objects and people into the air, damage critical infrastructure, and wreak destruction across entire cities. The seismic activity of an area is the frequency, type, and size of earthquakes experienced over a particular time. The seismicity at a particular location in the Earth is the average rate of seismic energy release per unit volume. In its most general sense, the word earthquake is used to describe any seismic event that generates seismic waves. Earthquakes can occur naturally or be induced by human activities, such as mining, fracking, and nuclear tests. The initial point of rupture is called the hypocenter or focus, while the ground level directly above it is the epicenter. Earthquakes are primarily caused by geological faults, but also by volcanic activity, landslides, and other seismic events. The frequency, type, and size of earthquakes in an area define its seismic activity, reflecting the average rate of seismic energy release. Significant historical earthquakes include the 1556 Shaanxi earthquake in China, with over 830,000 fatalities, and the 1960 Valdivia earthquake in Chile, the largest ever recorded at 9.5 magnitude. Earthquakes result in various effects, such as ground shaking and soil liquefaction, leading to significant damage and loss of life. When the epicenter of a large earthquake is located offshore, the seabed may be displaced sufficiently to cause a tsunami. Earthquakes can trigger landslides. Earthquakes' occurrence is influenced by tectonic movements along faults, including normal, reverse (thrust), and strike-slip faults, with energy release and rupture dynamics governed by the elastic-rebound theory. Efforts to manage earthquake risks involve prediction, forecasting, and preparedness, including seismic retrofitting and earthquake engineering to design structures that withstand shaking. The cultural impact of earthquakes spans myths, religious beliefs, and modern media, reflecting their profound influence on human societies. Similar seismic phenomena, known as marsquakes and moonquakes, have been observed on other celestial bodies, indicating the universality of such events beyond Earth. An earthquake is the shaking of the surface of Earth resulting from a sudden release of energy in the lithosphere that creates seismic waves. Earthquakes may also be referred to as quakes, tremors, or temblors. The word tremor is also used for non-earthquake seismic rumbling. In its most general sense, an earthquake is any seismic event—whether natural or caused by humans—that generates seismic waves. Earthquakes are caused mostly by the rupture of geological faults but also by other events such as volcanic activity, landslides, mine blasts, fracking and nuclear tests. An earthquake's point of initial rupture is called its hypocenter or focus. The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter. The seismic activity of an area is the frequency, type, and size of earthquakes experienced over a particular time. The seismicity at a particular location in the Earth is the average rate of seismic energy release per unit volume. One of the most devastating earthquakes in recorded history was the 1556 Shaanxi earthquake, which occurred on 23 January 1556 in Shaanxi, China. More than 830,000 people died.[2] Most houses in the area were yaodongs—dwellings carved out of loess hillsides—and many victims were killed when these structures collapsed. The 1976 Tangshan earthquake, which killed between 240,000 and 655,000 people, was the deadliest of the 20th century.[3] The 1960 Chilean earthquake is the largest earthquake that has been measured on a seismograph, reaching 9.5 magnitude on 22 May 1960.[4][5] Its epicenter was near Cañete, Chile. The energy released was approximately twice that of the next most powerful earthquake, the Good Friday earthquake (27 March 1964), which was centered in Prince William Sound, Alaska.[6][7] The ten largest recorded earthquakes have all been megathrust earthquakes; however, of these ten, only the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake is simultaneously one of the deadliest earthquakes in history. Earthquakes that caused the greatest loss of life, while powerful, were deadly because of their proximity to either heavily populated areas or the ocean, where earthquakes often create tsunamis that can devastate communities thousands of kilometers away. Regions most at risk for great loss of life include those where earthquakes are relatively rare but powerful, and poor regions with lax, unenforced, or nonexistent seismic building codes. Tectonic earthquakes occur anywhere on the earth where there is sufficient stored elastic strain energy to drive fracture propagation along a fault plane. The sides of a fault move past each other smoothly and aseismically only if there are no irregularities or asperities along the fault surface that increases the frictional resistance. Most fault surfaces do have such asperities, which leads to a form of stick-slip behavior. Once the fault has locked, continued relative motion between the plates leads to increasing stress and, therefore, stored strain energy in the volume around the fault surface. This continues until the stress has risen sufficiently to break through the asperity, suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault, releasing the stored energy.[8] This energy is released as a combination of radiated elastic strain seismic waves,[9] frictional heating of the fault surface, and cracking of the rock, thus causing an earthquake. This process of gradual build-up of strain and stress punctuated by occasional sudden earthquake failure is referred to as the elastic-rebound theory. It is estimated that only 10 percent or less of an earthquake's total energy is radiated as seismic energy. Most of the earthquake's energy is used to power the earthquake fracture growth or is converted into heat generated by friction. Therefore, earthquakes lower the Earth's available elastic potential energy and raise its temperature, though these changes are negligible compared to the conductive and convective flow of heat out from the Earth's deep interior.[10] There are three main types of fault, all of which may cause an interplate earthquake: normal, reverse (thrust), and strike-slip. Normal and reverse faulting are examples of dip-slip, where the displacement along the fault is in the direction of dip and where movement on them involves a vertical component. Many earthquakes are caused by movement on faults that have components of both dip-slip and strike-slip; this is known as oblique slip. The topmost, brittle part of the Earth's crust, and the cool slabs of the tectonic plates that are descending into the hot mantle, are the only parts of our planet that can store elastic energy and release it in fault ruptures. Rocks hotter than about 300 °C (572 °F) flow in response to stress; they do not rupture in earthquakes.[11][12] The maximum observed lengths of ruptures and mapped faults (which may break in a single rupture) are approximately 1,000 km (620 mi). Examples are the earthquakes in Alaska (1957), Chile (1960), and Sumatra (2004), all in subduction zones. The longest earthquake ruptures on strike-slip faults, like the San Andreas Fault (1857, 1906), the North Anatolian Fault in Turkey (1939), and the Denali Fault in Alaska (2002), are about half to one third as long as the lengths along subducting plate margins, and those along normal faults are even shorter. Normal faults occur mainly in areas where the crust is being extended such as a divergent boundary. Earthquakes associated with normal faults are generally less than magnitude 7. Maximum magnitudes along many normal faults are even more limited because many of them are located along spreading centers, as in Iceland, where the thickness of the brittle layer is only about six kilometres (3.7 mi).[13][14] Reverse faults occur in areas where the crust is being shortened such as at a convergent boundary. Reverse faults, particularly those along convergent boundaries, are associated with the most powerful earthquakes (called megathrust earthquakes) including almost all of those of magnitude 8 or more. Megathrust earthquakes are responsible for about 90% of the total seismic moment released worldwide.[15] Strike-slip faults are steep structures where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other; transform boundaries are a particular type of strike-slip fault. Strike-slip faults, particularly continental transforms, can produce major earthquakes up to about magnitude 8. Strike-slip faults tend to be oriented near vertically, resulting in an approximate width of 10 km (6.2 mi) within the brittle crust.[16] Thus, earthquakes with magnitudes much larger than 8 are not possible. In addition, there exists a hierarchy of stress levels in the three fault types. Thrust faults are generated by the highest, strike-slip by intermediate, and normal faults by the lowest stress levels.[17] This can easily be understood by considering the direction of the greatest principal stress, the direction of the force that \"pushes\" the rock mass during the faulting. In the case of normal faults, the rock mass is pushed down in a vertical direction, thus the pushing force (greatest principal stress) equals the weight of the rock mass itself. In the case of thrusting, the rock mass \"escapes\" in the direction of the least principal stress, namely upward, lifting the rock mass, and thus, the overburden equals the least principal stress. Strike-slip faulting is intermediate between the other two types described above. This difference in stress regime in the three faulting environments can contribute to differences in stress drop during faulting, which contributes to differences in the radiated energy, regardless of fault dimensions. For every unit increase in magnitude, there is a roughly thirty-fold increase in the energy released. For instance, an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 releases approximately 32 times more energy than a 5.0 magnitude earthquake and a 7.0 magnitude earthquake releases 1,000 times more energy than a 5.0 magnitude earthquake. An 8.6-magnitude earthquake releases the same amount of energy as 10,000 atomic bombs of the size used in World War II.[18] This is so because the energy released in an earthquake, and thus its magnitude, is proportional to the area of the fault that ruptures[19] and the stress drop. Therefore, the longer the length and the wider the width of the faulted area, the larger the resulting magnitude. The most important parameter controlling the maximum earthquake magnitude on a fault, however, is not the maximum available length, but the available width because the latter varies by a factor of 20. Along converging plate margins, the dip angle of the rupture plane is very shallow, typically about 10 degrees.[20] Thus, the width of the plane within the top brittle crust of the Earth can reach 50–100 km (31–62 mi) (such as in Japan, 2011, or in Alaska, 1964), making the most powerful earthquakes possible. The majority of tectonic earthquakes originate in the Ring of Fire at depths not exceeding tens of kilometers. Earthquakes occurring at a depth of less than 70 km (43 mi) are classified as \"shallow-focus\" earthquakes, while those with a focal depth between 70 and 300 km (43 and 186 mi) are commonly termed \"mid-focus\" or \"intermediate-depth\" earthquakes. In subduction zones, where older and colder oceanic crust descends beneath another tectonic plate, deep-focus earthquakes may occur at much greater depths (ranging from 300 to 700 km (190 to 430 mi)).[21] These seismically active areas of subduction are known as Wadati–Benioff zones. Deep-focus earthquakes occur at a depth where the subducted lithosphere should no longer be brittle, due to the high temperature and pressure. A possible mechanism for the generation of deep-focus earthquakes is faulting caused by olivine undergoing a phase transition into a spinel structure.[22] Earthquakes often occur in volcanic regions and are caused there, both by tectonic faults and the movement of magma in volcanoes. Such earthquakes can serve as an early warning of volcanic eruptions, as during the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens.[23] Earthquake swarms can serve as markers for the location of the flowing magma throughout the volcanoes. These swarms can be recorded by seismometers and tiltmeters (a device that measures ground slope) and used as sensors to predict imminent or upcoming eruptions.[24] A tectonic earthquake begins as an area of initial slip on the fault surface that forms the focus. Once the rupture has been initiated, it begins to propagate away from the focus, spreading out along the fault surface. Lateral propagation will continue until either the rupture reaches a barrier, such as the end of a fault segment, or a region on the fault where there is insufficient stress to allow continued rupture. For larger earthquakes, the depth extent of rupture will be constrained downwards by the brittle-ductile transition zone and upwards by the ground surface. The mechanics of this process are poorly understood because it is difficult either to recreate such rapid movements in a laboratory or to record seismic waves close to a nucleation zone due to strong ground motion.[25] In most cases, the rupture speed approaches, but does not exceed, the shear wave (S wave) velocity of the surrounding rock. There are a few exceptions to this: Supershear earthquake ruptures are known to have propagated at speeds greater than the S wave velocity. These have so far all been observed during large strike-slip events. The unusually wide zone of damage caused by the 2001 Kunlun earthquake has been attributed to the effects of the sonic boom developed in such earthquakes. Slow earthquake ruptures travel at unusually low velocities. A particularly dangerous form of slow earthquake is the tsunami earthquake, observed where the relatively low felt intensities, caused by the slow propagation speed of some great earthquakes, fail to alert the population of the neighboring coast, as in the 1896 Sanriku earthquake.[25] During an earthquake, high temperatures can develop at the fault plane, increasing pore pressure and consequently vaporization of the groundwater already contained within the rock.[27][28][29] In the coseismic phase, such an increase can significantly affect slip evolution and speed, in the post-seismic phase it can control the Aftershock sequence because, after the main event, pore pressure increase slowly propagates into the surrounding fracture network.[30][29] From the point of view of the Mohr-Coulomb strength theory, an increase in fluid pressure reduces the normal stress acting on the fault plane that holds it in place, and fluids can exert a lubricating effect. As thermal overpressurization may provide positive feedback between slip and strength fall at the fault plane, a common opinion is that it may enhance the faulting process instability. After the mainshock, the pressure gradient between the fault plane and the neighboring rock causes a fluid flow that increases pore pressure in the surrounding fracture networks; such an increase may trigger new faulting processes by reactivating adjacent faults, giving rise to aftershocks.[30][29] Analogously, artificial pore pressure increase, by fluid injection in Earth's crust, may induce seismicity. Tides may trigger some seismicity. Most earthquakes form part of a sequence, related to each other in terms of location and time.[31] Most earthquake clusters consist of small tremors that cause little to no damage, but there is a theory that earthquakes can recur in a regular pattern.[32] Earthquake clustering has been observed, for example, in Parkfield, California where a long-term research study is being conducted around the Parkfield earthquake cluster.[33] An aftershock is an earthquake that occurs after a previous earthquake, the mainshock. Rapid changes of stress between rocks, and the stress from the original earthquake are the main causes of these aftershocks,[34] along with the crust around the ruptured fault plane as it adjusts to the effects of the mainshock.[31] An aftershock is in the same region as the main shock but always of a smaller magnitude, however, they can still be powerful enough to cause even more damage to buildings that were already previously damaged from the mainshock.[34] If an aftershock is larger than the mainshock, the aftershock is redesignated as the mainshock and the original main shock is redesignated as a foreshock. Aftershocks are formed as the crust around the displaced fault plane adjusts to the effects of the mainshock.[31] Earthquake swarms are sequences of earthquakes striking in a specific area within a short period. They are different from earthquakes followed by a series of aftershocks by the fact that no single earthquake in the sequence is the main shock, so none has a notably higher magnitude than another. An example of an earthquake swarm is the 2004 activity at Yellowstone National Park.[35] In August 2012, a swarm of earthquakes shook Southern California's Imperial Valley, showing the most recorded activity in the area since the 1970s.[36] Sometimes a series of earthquakes occur in what has been called an earthquake storm, where the earthquakes strike a fault in clusters, each triggered by the shaking or stress redistribution of the previous earthquakes. Similar to aftershocks but on adjacent segments of fault, these storms occur over the course of years, with some of the later earthquakes as damaging as the early ones. Such a pattern was observed in the sequence of about a dozen earthquakes that struck the North Anatolian Fault in Turkey in the 20th century and has been inferred for older anomalous clusters of large earthquakes in the Middle East.[37][38] It is estimated that around 500,000 earthquakes occur each year, detectable with current instrumentation. About 100,000 of these can be felt.[4][5] Minor earthquakes occur very frequently around the world in places like California and Alaska in the U.S., as well as in El Salvador, Mexico, Guatemala, Chile, Peru, Indonesia, the Philippines, Iran, Pakistan, the Azores in Portugal, Turkey, New Zealand, Greece, Italy, India, Nepal, and Japan.[40] Larger earthquakes occur less frequently, the relationship being exponential; for example, roughly ten times as many earthquakes larger than magnitude 4 occur than earthquakes larger than magnitude 5.[41] In the (low seismicity) United Kingdom, for example, it has been calculated that the average recurrences are: an earthquake of 3.7–4.6 every year, an earthquake of 4.7–5.5 every 10 years, and an earthquake of 5.6 or larger every 100 years.[42] This is an example of the Gutenberg–Richter law. The number of seismic stations has increased from about 350 in 1931 to many thousands today. As a result, many more earthquakes are reported than in the past, but this is because of the vast improvement in instrumentation, rather than an increase in the number of earthquakes. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimates that, since 1900, there have been an average of 18 major earthquakes (magnitude 7.0–7.9) and one great earthquake (magnitude 8.0 or greater) per year, and that this average has been relatively stable.[43] In recent years, the number of major earthquakes per year has decreased, though this is probably a statistical fluctuation rather than a systematic trend.[44] More detailed statistics on the size and frequency of earthquakes is available from the United States Geological Survey.[45] A recent increase in the number of major earthquakes has been noted, which could be explained by a cyclical pattern of periods of intense tectonic activity, interspersed with longer periods of low intensity. However, accurate recordings of earthquakes only began in the early 1900s, so it is too early to categorically state that this is the case.[46] Most of the world's earthquakes (90%, and 81% of the largest) take place in the 40,000-kilometre-long (25,000 mi), horseshoe-shaped zone called the circum-Pacific seismic belt, known as the Pacific Ring of Fire, which for the most part bounds the Pacific plate.[47][48] Massive earthquakes tend to occur along other plate boundaries too, such as along the Himalayan Mountains.[49] With the rapid growth of mega-cities such as Mexico City, Tokyo, and Tehran in areas of high seismic risk, some seismologists are warning that a single earthquake may claim the lives of up to three million people.[50] While most earthquakes are caused by the movement of the Earth's tectonic plates, human activity can also produce earthquakes. Activities both above ground and below may change the stresses and strains on the crust, including building reservoirs, extracting resources such as coal or oil, and injecting fluids underground for waste disposal or fracking.[51] Most of these earthquakes have small magnitudes. The 5.7 magnitude 2011 Oklahoma earthquake is thought to have been caused by disposing wastewater from oil production into injection wells,[52] and studies point to the state's oil industry as the cause of other earthquakes in the past century.[53] A Columbia University paper suggested that the 8.0 magnitude 2008 Sichuan earthquake was induced by loading from the Zipingpu Dam,[54] though the link has not been conclusively proved.[55] The instrumental scales used to describe the size of an earthquake began with the Richter scale in the 1930s. It is a relatively simple measurement of an event's amplitude, and its use has become minimal in the 21st century. Seismic waves travel through the Earth's interior and can be recorded by seismometers at great distances. The surface-wave magnitude was developed in the 1950s as a means to measure remote earthquakes and to improve the accuracy for larger events. The moment magnitude scale not only measures the amplitude of the shock but also takes into account the seismic moment (total rupture area, average slip of the fault, and rigidity of the rock). The Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale, the Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale, and the Mercalli intensity scale are based on the observed effects and are related to the intensity of shaking. The shaking of the earth is a common phenomenon that has been experienced by humans from the earliest of times. Before the development of strong-motion accelerometers, the intensity of a seismic event was estimated based on the observed effects. Magnitude and intensity are not directly related and calculated using different methods. The magnitude of an earthquake is a single value that describes the size of the earthquake at its source. Intensity is the measure of shaking at different locations around the earthquake. Intensity values vary from place to place, depending on the distance from the earthquake and the underlying rock or soil makeup.[56] The first scale for measuring earthquake magnitudes was developed by Charles Francis Richter in 1935. Subsequent scales (seismic magnitude scales) have retained a key feature, where each unit represents a ten-fold difference in the amplitude of the ground shaking and a 32-fold difference in energy. Subsequent scales are also adjusted to have approximately the same numeric value within the limits of the scale.[57] Although the mass media commonly reports earthquake magnitudes as \"Richter magnitude\" or \"Richter scale\", standard practice by most seismological authorities is to express an earthquake's strength on the moment magnitude scale, which is based on the actual energy released by an earthquake, the static seismic moment.[58][59] Every earthquake produces different types of seismic waves, which travel through rock with different velocities: Propagation velocity of the seismic waves through solid rock ranges from approx. 3 km/s (1.9 mi/s) up to 13 km/s (8.1 mi/s), depending on the density and elasticity of the medium. In the Earth's interior, the shock- or P waves travel much faster than the S waves (approx. relation 1.7:1). The differences in travel time from the epicenter to the observatory are a measure of the distance and can be used to image both sources of earthquakes and structures within the Earth. Also, the depth of the hypocenter can be computed roughly. P wave speed S waves speed As a consequence, the first waves of a distant earthquake arrive at an observatory via the Earth's mantle. On average, the kilometer distance to the earthquake is the number of seconds between the P- and S wave times 8.[60] Slight deviations are caused by inhomogeneities of subsurface structure. By such analysis of seismograms, the Earth's core was located in 1913 by Beno Gutenberg. S waves and later arriving surface waves do most of the damage compared to P waves. P waves squeeze and expand the material in the same direction they are traveling, whereas S waves shake the ground up and down and back and forth.[61] Earthquakes are not only categorized by their magnitude but also by the place where they occur. The world is divided into 754 Flinn–Engdahl regions (F-E regions), which are based on political and geographical boundaries as well as seismic activity. More active zones are divided into smaller F-E regions whereas less active zones belong to larger F-E regions. Standard reporting of earthquakes includes its magnitude, date and time of occurrence, geographic coordinates of its epicenter, depth of the epicenter, geographical region, distances to population centers, location uncertainty, several parameters that are included in USGS earthquake reports (number of stations reporting, number of observations, etc.), and a unique event ID.[62] Although relatively slow seismic waves have traditionally been used to detect earthquakes, scientists realized in 2016 that gravitational measurement could provide instantaneous detection of earthquakes, and confirmed this by analyzing gravitational records associated with the 2011 Tohoku-Oki (\"Fukushima\") earthquake.[63][64] The effects of earthquakes include, but are not limited to, the following: Shaking and ground rupture are the main effects created by earthquakes, principally resulting in more or less severe damage to buildings and other rigid structures. The severity of the local effects depends on the complex combination of the earthquake magnitude, the distance from the epicenter, and the local geological and geomorphological conditions, which may amplify or reduce wave propagation.[65] The ground-shaking is measured by ground acceleration. Specific local geological, geomorphological, and geostructural features can induce high levels of shaking on the ground surface even from low-intensity earthquakes. This effect is called site or local amplification. It is principally due to the transfer of the seismic motion from hard deep soils to soft superficial soils and the effects of seismic energy focalization owing to the typical geometrical setting of such deposits. Ground rupture is a visible breaking and displacement of the Earth's surface along the trace of the fault, which may be of the order of several meters in the case of major earthquakes. Ground rupture is a major risk for large engineering structures such as dams, bridges, and nuclear power stations and requires careful mapping of existing faults to identify any that are likely to break the ground surface within the life of the structure.[66] Soil liquefaction occurs when, because of the shaking, water-saturated granular material (such as sand) temporarily loses its strength and transforms from a solid to a liquid. Soil liquefaction may cause rigid structures, like buildings and bridges, to tilt or sink into the liquefied deposits. For example, in the 1964 Alaska earthquake, soil liquefaction caused many buildings to sink into the ground, eventually collapsing upon themselves.[67] Physical damage from an earthquake will vary depending on the intensity of shaking in a given area and the type of population. Underserved and developing communities frequently experience more severe impacts (and longer lasting) from a seismic event compared to well-developed communities.[68] Impacts may include: With these impacts and others, the aftermath may bring disease, a lack of basic necessities, mental consequences such as panic attacks and depression to survivors,[69] and higher insurance premiums. Recovery times will vary based on the level of damage and the socioeconomic status of the impacted community. Earthquakes can produce slope instability leading to landslides, a major geological hazard. Landslide danger may persist while emergency personnel is attempting rescue work.[70] Earthquakes can cause fires by damaging electrical power or gas lines. In the event of water mains rupturing and a loss of pressure, it may also become difficult to stop the spread of a fire once it has started. For example, more deaths in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake were caused by fire than by the earthquake itself.[71] Tsunamis are long-wavelength, long-period sea waves produced by the sudden or abrupt movement of large volumes of water—including when an earthquake occurs at sea. In the open ocean, the distance between wave crests can surpass 100 kilometres (62 mi), and the wave periods can vary from five minutes to one hour. Such tsunamis travel 600–800 kilometers per hour (373–497 miles per hour), depending on water depth. Large waves produced by an earthquake or a submarine landslide can overrun nearby coastal areas in a matter of minutes. Tsunamis can also travel thousands of kilometers across open ocean and wreak destruction on far shores hours after the earthquake that generated them.[72] Ordinarily, subduction earthquakes under magnitude 7.5 do not cause tsunamis, although some instances of this have been recorded. Most destructive tsunamis are caused by earthquakes of magnitude 7.5 or more.[72] Floods may be secondary effects of earthquakes if dams are damaged. Earthquakes may cause landslips to dam rivers, which collapse and cause floods.[73] The terrain below the Sarez Lake in Tajikistan is in danger of catastrophic flooding if the landslide dam formed by the earthquake, known as the Usoi Dam, were to fail during a future earthquake. Impact projections suggest the flood could affect roughly five million people.[74] Earthquake prediction is a branch of the science of seismology concerned with the specification of the time, location, and magnitude of future earthquakes within stated limits.[75] Many methods have been developed for predicting the time and place in which earthquakes will occur. Despite considerable research efforts by seismologists, scientifically reproducible predictions cannot yet be made to a specific day or month.[76] Popular belief holds earthquakes are preceded by earthquake weather, in the early morning.[77][78] While forecasting is usually considered to be a type of prediction, earthquake forecasting is often differentiated from earthquake prediction. Earthquake forecasting is concerned with the probabilistic assessment of general earthquake hazards, including the frequency and magnitude of damaging earthquakes in a given area over years or decades.[79] For well-understood faults the probability that a segment may rupture during the next few decades can be estimated.[80][81] Earthquake warning systems have been developed that can provide regional notification of an earthquake in progress, but before the ground surface has begun to move, potentially allowing people within the system's range to seek shelter before the earthquake's impact is felt. The objective of earthquake engineering is to foresee the impact of earthquakes on buildings, bridges, tunnels, roadways, and other structures, and to design such structures to minimize the risk of damage. Existing structures can be modified by seismic retrofitting to improve their resistance to earthquakes. Earthquake insurance can provide building owners with financial protection against losses resulting from earthquakes. Emergency management strategies can be employed by a government or organization to mitigate risks and prepare for consequences. Artificial intelligence may help to assess buildings and plan precautionary operations. The Igor expert system is part of a mobile laboratory that supports the procedures leading to the seismic assessment of masonry buildings and the planning of retrofitting operations on them. It has been applied to assess buildings in Lisbon, Rhodes, and Naples.[82] Individuals can also take preparedness steps like securing water heaters and heavy items that could injure someone, locating shutoffs for utilities, and being educated about what to do when the shaking starts. For areas near large bodies of water, earthquake preparedness encompasses the possibility of a tsunami caused by a large earthquake. From the lifetime of the Greek philosopher Anaxagoras in the 5th century BCE to the 14th century CE, earthquakes were usually attributed to \"air (vapors) in the cavities of the Earth.\"[83] Thales of Miletus (625–547 BCE) was the only documented person who believed that earthquakes were caused by tension between the earth and water.[83] Other theories existed, including the Greek philosopher Anaxamines' (585–526 BCE) beliefs that short incline episodes of dryness and wetness caused seismic activity. The Greek philosopher Democritus (460–371 BCE) blamed water in general for earthquakes.[83] Pliny the Elder called earthquakes \"underground thunderstorms\".[83] In Norse mythology, earthquakes were explained as the violent struggle of the god Loki. When Loki, god of mischief and strife, murdered Baldr, god of beauty and light, he was punished by being bound in a cave with a poisonous serpent placed above his head dripping venom. Loki's wife Sigyn stood by him with a bowl to catch the poison, but whenever she had to empty the bowl, the poison dripped on Loki's face, forcing him to jerk his head away and thrash against his bonds, which caused the earth to tremble.[84] In Greek mythology, Poseidon was the cause and god of earthquakes. When he was in a bad mood, he struck the ground with a trident, causing earthquakes and other calamities. He also used earthquakes to punish and inflict fear upon people as revenge.[85] In Japanese mythology, Namazu (鯰) is a giant catfish who causes earthquakes. Namazu lives in the mud beneath the earth and is guarded by the god Kashima, who restrains the fish with a stone. When Kashima lets his guard fall, Namazu thrashes about, causing violent earthquakes.[86] In the New Testament, Matthew's Gospel refers to earthquakes occurring both after the death of Jesus (Matthew 27:51, 54) and at his resurrection (Matthew 28:2).[87] Earthquakes form part of the picture through which Jesus portrays the beginning of the end of time.[88] In modern popular culture, the portrayal of earthquakes is shaped by the memory of great cities laid waste, such as Kobe in 1995 or San Francisco in 1906.[89] Fictional earthquakes tend to strike suddenly and without warning.[89] For this reason, stories about earthquakes generally begin with the disaster and focus on its immediate aftermath, as in Short Walk to Daylight (1972), The Ragged Edge (1968) or Aftershock: Earthquake in New York (1999).[89] A notable example is Heinrich von Kleist's classic novella, The Earthquake in Chile, which describes the destruction of Santiago in 1647. Haruki Murakami's short fiction collection After the Quake depicts the consequences of the Kobe earthquake of 1995. The most popular single earthquake in fiction is the hypothetical \"Big One\" expected of California's San Andreas Fault someday, as depicted in the novels Richter 10 (1996), Goodbye California (1977), 2012 (2009), and San Andreas (2015), among other works.[89] Jacob M. Appel's widely anthologized short story, A Comparative Seismology, features a con artist who convinces an elderly woman that an apocalyptic earthquake is imminent.[90] Contemporary depictions of earthquakes in film are variable in the manner in which they reflect human psychological reactions to the actual trauma that can be caused to directly afflicted families and their loved ones.[91] Disaster mental health response research emphasizes the need to be aware of the different roles of loss of family and key community members, loss of home and familiar surroundings, and loss of essential supplies and services to maintain survival.[92][93] Particularly for children, the clear availability of caregiving adults who can protect, nourish, and clothe them in the aftermath of the earthquake and help them make sense of what has befallen them is more important to their emotional and physical health than the simple giving of provisions.[94] As was observed after other disasters involving destruction and loss of life and their media depictions, recently observed in the 2010 Haiti earthquake, it is also believed to be important not to pathologize the reactions to loss and displacement or disruption of governmental administration and services, but rather to validate the reactions to support constructive problem-solving and reflection.[95] Phenomena similar to earthquakes have been observed on other planets (e.g., marsquakes on Mars) and on the Moon (e.g., moonquakes).",

Over the centuries, earthquakes have been responsible for millions of deaths and an incalculable amount of damage to property. Depending on their intensity, earthquakes (specifically, the degree to which they cause the ground’s surface to shake) can topple buildings and bridges, rupture gas pipelines and other infrastructure, and trigger landslides, tsunamis, and volcanoes. These phenomena are primarily responsible for deaths and injuries. Very great earthquakes occur on average about once per year. Earthquake waves, more commonly known as seismic waves, are vibrations generated by an earthquake and propagated within Earth or along its surface. There are four principal types of elastic waves: two, primary and secondary waves, travel within Earth, whereas the other two, Rayleigh and Love waves, called surface waves, travel along its surface. In addition, seismic waves can be produced artificially by explosions. Magnitude is a measure of the amplitude (height) of the seismic waves an earthquake’s source produces as recorded by seismographs. Seismologist Charles F. Richter created an earthquake magnitude scale using the logarithm of the largest seismic wave’s amplitude to base 10. Richter’s scale was originally for measuring the magnitude of earthquakes from magnitudes 3 to 7, limiting its usefulness. Today the moment magnitude scale, a closer measure of an earthquake’s total energy release, is preferred. Earthquakes can occur anywhere, but they occur mainly along fault lines (planar or curved fractures in the rocks of Earth’s crust), where compressional or tensional forces move rocks on opposite sides of a fracture. Faults extend from a few centimetres to many hundreds of kilometres. In addition, most of the world’s earthquakes occur within the Ring of Fire, a long horseshoe-shaped belt of earthquake epicentres, volcanoes, and tectonic plate boundaries fringing the Pacific basin. earthquake, any sudden shaking of the ground caused by the passage of seismic waves through Earth’s rocks. Seismic waves are produced when some form of energy stored in Earth’s crust is suddenly released, usually when masses of rock straining against one another suddenly fracture and “slip.” Earthquakes occur most often along geologic faults, narrow zones where rock masses move in relation to one another. The major fault lines of the world are located at the fringes of the huge tectonic plates that make up Earth’s crust. (See the table of major earthquakes.) Little was understood about earthquakes until the emergence of seismology at the beginning of the 20th century. Seismology, which involves the scientific study of all aspects of earthquakes, has yielded answers to such long-standing questions as why and how earthquakes occur. About 50,000 earthquakes large enough to be noticed without the aid of instruments occur annually over the entire Earth. Of these, approximately 100 are of sufficient size to produce substantial damage if their centres are near areas of habitation. Very great earthquakes occur on average about once per year. Over the centuries they have been responsible for millions of deaths and an incalculable amount of damage to property. Earth’s major earthquakes occur mainly in belts coinciding with the margins of tectonic plates. This has long been apparent from early catalogs of felt earthquakes and is even more readily discernible in modern seismicity maps, which show instrumentally determined epicentres. The most important earthquake belt is the Circum-Pacific Belt, which affects many populated coastal regions around the Pacific Ocean—for example, those of New Zealand, New Guinea, Japan, the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, and the western coasts of North and South America. It is estimated that 80 percent of the energy presently released in earthquakes comes from those whose epicentres are in this belt. The seismic activity is by no means uniform throughout the belt, and there are a number of branches at various points. Because at many places the Circum-Pacific Belt is associated with volcanic activity, it has been popularly dubbed the “Pacific Ring of Fire.” A second belt, known as the Alpide Belt, passes through the Mediterranean region eastward through Asia and joins the Circum-Pacific Belt in the East Indies. The energy released in earthquakes from this belt is about 15 percent of the world total. There also are striking connected belts of seismic activity, mainly along oceanic ridges—including those in the Arctic Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, and the western Indian Ocean—and along the rift valleys of East Africa. This global seismicity distribution is best understood in terms of its plate tectonic setting. Earthquakes are caused by the sudden release of energy within some limited region of the rocks of the Earth. The energy can be released by elastic strain, gravity, chemical reactions, or even the motion of massive bodies. Of all these the release of elastic strain is the most important cause, because this form of energy is the only kind that can be stored in sufficient quantity in the Earth to produce major disturbances. Earthquakes associated with this type of energy release are called tectonic earthquakes.",

Latest Earthquakes | Chat Share Social Media Originally written by Lisa Wald (U.S. Geological Survey) for “The Green Frog News” An earthquake is what happens when two blocks of the earth suddenly slip past one another. The surface where they slip is called the fault or fault plane. The location below the earth’s surface where the earthquake starts is called the hypocenter, and the location directly above it on the surface of the earth is called the epicenter. Sometimes an earthquake has foreshocks. These are smaller earthquakes that happen in the same place as the larger earthquake that follows. Scientists can’t tell that an earthquake is a foreshock until the larger earthquake happens. The largest, main earthquake is called the mainshock. Mainshocks always have aftershocks that follow. These are smaller earthquakes that occur afterwards in the same place as the mainshock. Depending on the size of the mainshock, aftershocks can continue for weeks, months, and even years after the mainshock! The earth has four major layers: the inner core, outer core, mantle and crust. The crust and the top of the mantle make up a thin skin on the surface of our planet. But this skin is not all in one piece – it is made up of many pieces like a puzzle covering the surface of the earth. Not only that, but these puzzle pieces keep slowly moving around, sliding past one another and bumping into each other. We call these puzzle pieces tectonic plates, and the edges of the plates are called the plate boundaries. The plate boundaries are made up of many faults, and most of the earthquakes around the world occur on these faults. Since the edges of the plates are rough, they get stuck while the rest of the plate keeps moving. Finally, when the plate has moved far enough, the edges unstick on one of the faults and there is an earthquake. While the edges of faults are stuck together, and the rest of the block is moving, the energy that would normally cause the blocks to slide past one another is being stored up. When the force of the moving blocks finally overcomes the friction of the jagged edges of the fault and it unsticks, all that stored up energy is released. The energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions in the form of seismic waves like ripples on a pond. The seismic waves shake the earth as they move through it, and when the waves reach the earth’s surface, they shake the ground and anything on it, like our houses and us! Earthquakes are recorded by instruments called seismographs. The recording they make is called a seismogram. The seismograph has a base that sets firmly in the ground, and a heavy weight that hangs free. When an earthquake causes the ground to shake, the base of the seismograph shakes too, but the hanging weight does not. Instead the spring or string that it is hanging from absorbs all the movement. The difference in position between the shaking part of the seismograph and the motionless part is what is recorded. The size of an earthquake depends on the size of the fault and the amount of slip on the fault, but that’s not something scientists can simply measure with a measuring tape since faults are many kilometers deep beneath the earth’s surface. So how do they measure an earthquake? They use the seismogram recordings made on the seismographs at the surface of the earth to determine how large the earthquake was (figure 5). A short wiggly line that doesn’t wiggle very much means a small earthquake, and a long wiggly line that wiggles a lot means a large earthquake. The length of the wiggle depends on the size of the fault, and the size of the wiggle depends on the amount of slip. The size of the earthquake is called its magnitude. There is one magnitude for each earthquake. Scientists also talk about theintensity of shaking from an earthquake, and this varies depending on where you are during the earthquake. Seismograms come in handy for locating earthquakes too, and being able to see the P wave and the S wave is important. You learned how P & S waves each shake the ground in different ways as they travel through it. P waves are also faster than S waves, and this fact is what allows us to tell where an earthquake was. To understand how this works, let’s compare P and S waves to lightning and thunder. Light travels faster than sound, so during a thunderstorm you will first see the lightning and then you will hear the thunder. If you are close to the lightning, the thunder will boom right after the lightning, but if you are far away from the lightning, you can count several seconds before you hear the thunder. The further you are from the storm, the longer it will take between the lightning and the thunder. P waves are like the lightning, and S waves are like the thunder. The P waves travel faster and shake the ground where you are first. Then the S waves follow and shake the ground also. If you are close to the earthquake, the P and S wave will come one right after the other, but if you are far away, there will be more time between the two. By looking at the amount of time between the P and S wave on a seismogram recorded on a seismograph, scientists can tell how far away the earthquake was from that location. However, they can’t tell in what direction from the seismograph the earthquake was, only how far away it was. If they draw a circle on a map around the station where the radius of the circle is the determined distance to the earthquake, they know the earthquake lies somewhere on the circle. But where? Scientists then use a method called triangulation to determine exactly where the earthquake was (see image below). It is called triangulation because a triangle has three sides, and it takes three seismographs to locate an earthquake. If you draw a circle on a map around three different seismographs where the radius of each is the distance from that station to the earthquake, the intersection of those three circles is the epicenter! No, and it is unlikely they will ever be able to predict them. Scientists have tried many different ways of predicting earthquakes, but none have been successful. On any particular fault, scientists know there will be another earthquake sometime in the future, but they have no way of telling when it will happen. These are two questions that do not yet have definite answers. If weather does affect earthquake occurrence, or if some animals or people can tell when an earthquake is coming, we do not yet understand how it works. Children's Privacy Policy",

                "content": "An earthquake is when Earth's tectonic plates shake and move Earth's surface. Strong earthquakes damage buildings. Disturbances in the Earth cause earthquakes. Different tectonic plates are slowly moving. When they get stuck, tension builds up in them. Earthquakes occur when tectonic plates suddenly break free, so they start moving quickly. The first point of an earthquake's rupture is called its hypocenter or focus. The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter. People who study earthquakes are called seismologists. Many earthquakes can occur in a small area in a short period of time. The sudden release of stress in the tectonic plates sends waves of energy that travel through the Earth. Seismology studies the cause, recurrence, type and magnitude of earthquakes. The effect of an earthquake can be measured with a seismometer. A seismometer detects the tremors of the earth and plots the tremors on a seismograph. The strength or magnitude of an earthquake can be measured using the Richter scale. The Richter scale was invented by Charles Francis Richter in 1935. The scale is numbered 0-10. A 2 on this scale is a tremor that is not easily recorded. And damage of size 5 (or more) in a wide area. The largest earthquake ever measured had a magnitude of 9.5. No one can tell when an earthquake will happen. But we know where earthquakes are likely to occur in the future, such as near fault lines. An earthquake under the ocean can create a huge wave called a tsunami. Tsunamis can also cause a lot of destruction. Earthquake zones are concentrated in some parts of the world. The first is the Pacific belt, which circles the Pacific Ocean. This part is the biggest seismic belt: it has the most active earthquakes and the most volcanoes.[1] The second part is the Alpide belt. It includes the seismic activities from Sumatra, to the Himalayas, to south Europe and north Africa, to the Atlantic Ocean. These belts are along the edges of tectonic plates. The tectonic plates push on each other and make great amounts of tension. Earthquakes sometimes hit cities and kill hundreds or thousands of people. Most earthquakes happen along the Pacific Ring of Fire but the biggest ones mostly happen in other places. Tectonically active places are places where earthquakes or volcanic eruptions are regularly repeated. Earthquakes are caused by tectonic movements in the Earth's crust. The main cause is when tectonic plates ride one over the other, causing orogeny (mountain building), and severe earthquakes.[2] The boundaries between moving plates form the largest fault surfaces on Earth. When they stick, motion between the plates leads to increasing stress. This continues until the stress rises and breaks, suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault. This releases the stored energy as shock waves. The San Andreas fault in San Francisco, and Rift valley fault in Africa are faults like this. Earthquakes caused by volcanic eruptions can be quite devastating. However, these earthquakes are confined to areas around active volcanoes. Often the causes are not known, except in the most general terms. An example is the largest earthquake in the history of the United States: the 1811–1812 New Madrid earthquakes. These are described as caused by very deep shifts in ancient rock formations. In other words, the cause is not known in detail. In areas of intense mining activity, often the roofs of underground mines collapse and minor tremors take place. These are called collapse earthquakes. There are three main types of geological fault that may cause an earthquake: normal, reverse (thrust) and strike-slip. Normal faults occur mainly in areas where the crust is being extended. Reverse faults occur in areas where the crust is being shortened. Strike-slip faults are steep structures where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other. Most earthquakes form part of a sequence, related to each other in terms of location and time.[3] Most earthquake clusters consist of small tremors which cause little to no damage, but there is a theory that earthquakes can recur in a regular pattern.[4] A foreshock is an earthquake that happens before a larger earthquake, called the mainshock. An aftershock is an earthquake that happens after a previous earthquake, the mainshock. An aftershock is in the same place of the main shock but always of a smaller magnitude. Aftershocks are formed as the crust adjusts to the effects of the main shock.[3] Earthquake swarms are sequences of earthquakes striking in a specific area within a short period of time. They are different from earthquakes followed by a series of aftershocks by the fact that no single earthquake in the sequence is obviously the main shock, therefore none have notably higher magnitudes than the other. An example of an earthquake swarm is the 2004 activity at Yellowstone National Park.[5] Sometimes a series of earthquakes happen in a sort of earthquake storm, where the earthquakes strike a fault in clusters, each triggered by the shaking or stress redistribution of the previous earthquakes. Similar to aftershocks but on adjacent segments of fault, these storms happen over the course of years, and with some of the later earthquakes as damaging as the early ones. Such a pattern happened in the North Anatolian fault in Turkey in the 20th century.[6][7] A tsunami is a chain of fast moving waves in the ocean caused by powerful earthquakes. They are very serious challenges for people's safety and for earthquake engineering. Those waves can flood coastal areas, destroy houses and even swipe away whole towns.[8] This is a danger for the whole mankind. Unfortunately, tsunamis cannot be prevented. However, there are warning systems[9] which may warn the population before the big waves reach the land to let them enough time to rush to safety. Earthquake-proof buildings are constructed to withstand the destructive force of an earthquake. This depends upon its type of construction, shape, mass distribution, and rigidity. Different combinations are used. Square, rectangular, and shell-shaped buildings can withstand earthquakes better than skyscrapers. To reduce stress, a building's ground floor can be supported by extremely rigid, empty columns, while the rest of the building is supported by flexible columns inside the empty columns. Another method is to use rollers or rubber pads to separate the base columns from the ground, allowing the columns to shake parallel to each other during an earthquake. To help prevent a roof from collapsing, builders make the roof out of light-weight materials. Outdoor walls are made with stronger and more reinforced materials such as steel or reinforced concrete. During an earthquake, flexible windows may help hold the windows together so they don't break.",

Making his screen acting debut on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air in 1995, he portrayed the lead role on the short-lived series Opposite Sex in 2000 before landing his breakthrough role in the comedy-drama series Gilmore Girls (2001–2007). Ventimiglia starred as Peter Petrelli in the superhero series Heroes (2006–2010). After appearing in main roles in the series Mob City (2013), Chosen (2013), and The Whispers (2015), he starred as Jack Pearson on This Is Us (2016–2022), for which he has received three nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. He also starred in the drama series The Company You Keep (2023). In film, Ventimiglia made his breakthrough as Rocky Balboa's son in the sixth installment of the Rocky film series, Rocky Balboa (2006), going on to reprise the role in the eighth installment Creed II (2018). He has also appeared in Pathology (2008), That's My Boy (2012), Kiss of the Damned (2013), Grace of Monaco (2014), Devil's Gate (2017), and The Art of Racing in the Rain (2019). Ventimiglia was born on July 8, 1977, in Anaheim, California,[1] the youngest child of Carol and Peter Ventimiglia,[2] a Vietnam War veteran.[3] He has two sisters.[4] His father is of Sicilian descent and his mother has English and Scottish ancestry.[1] Ventimiglia has a self-described \"crooked mouth,\" having been born with damaged facial nerves causing the left side of his mouth to remain immobile – much like actor Sylvester Stallone, with whom he worked in Rocky Balboa.[2] Ventimiglia attended El Modena High School in Orange, California. During high school, Ventimiglia wrestled, acted in drama productions and served as student government president, graduating in 1995. At eighteen, Ventimiglia studied at the American Conservatory Theater for their summer program,[5] subsequently attending the University of California, Los Angeles as a theatre major.[6] At eighteen, Ventimiglia pursued an acting career, first starring as a gay teenager in Must Be the Music, a short film released as part of Strand Releasing's Boys Life 2.[7][8] He enrolled at UCLA before landing a role on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, guest starring on television series including CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, Sabrina, the Teenage Witch, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and Boston Public. He played Jed Perry, in the short-lived Fox TV series, Opposite Sex, which originally aired in 2000.[9] From 2001 to 2006, Ventimiglia played brooding teen Jess Mariano on Gilmore Girls; he was introduced in the second season as a leading cast member. He signed on for a spin-off of Gilmore Girls called Windward Circle which was to be focused on the relationship between Jess and his estranged father (played by Rob Estes), but the proposed series never made it to air.[10] Afterward, he dropped down to a guest star/recurring cast member, and he came back for four episodes in season four and two episodes in season six. In the third and final season of American Dreams, Ventimiglia played Chris Pierce, the rebellious boyfriend of Meg Pryor (Brittany Snow);[11] Pierce and his single mother, Shelly (Daphne Zuniga), a Playboy bunny, moved into the house next to the Pryors. In 2005, he starred in the mid-season replacement series The Bedford Diaries. The producers had only Ventimiglia in mind, but the show lasted only eight episodes and was one of several shows not picked up by the newly formed network The CW. In between television work, Ventimiglia had supporting roles in the horror films Cursed (2005), directed by Wes Craven, and Stay Alive (2006), as well as starring roles in the short film Intelligence and the full-length feature Dirty Deeds (2005). The same year, he was cast as Robert \"Rocky Jr.\" Balboa, the son of Rocky Balboa, in the sixth Rocky installment Rocky Balboa which was released in December 2006.[12] He starred as Peter Petrelli in the NBC series Heroes, a show about \"ordinary\" people discovering they have superpowers, and portrayed the character until the series' conclusion in 2010. Ventimiglia also produced and developed a mini web-series called It's a Mall World as part of a marketing campaign for American Eagle Outfitters in 2007.[13] In mid-2007, he starred as the love interest of pop/R&B singer Fergie in the music video for \"Big Girls Don't Cry\". In 2008, he starred as a medical student in the horror film Pathology. The film co-starred Charmed actress Alyssa Milano and was directed by Marc Schölermann for MGM.[14] In 2005, Divide Pictures created the DSC, or Divide Social Club, an online and global social network for like-minded people[15] co-founded by Ventimiglia with his best friends Russ Cundiff and Dino DeMilio, a radio producer for The Tom Leykis Show. Ventimiglia, Cundiff, and Divide Pictures partnered with Top Cow to produce the comic series REST which will be a monthly limited series. The comic is about John Barrett, a white-collar New Yorker whose life changes when he becomes addicted to a drug that prevents him from falling asleep. Divide also has a comic book called Berserker written by Rick Loverd.[16] After working with writers Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor on Pathology, Ventimiglia appeared in the pair's next film, Gamer.[17] Ventimiglia also starred in the Xavier Gens apocalypse thriller film, The Divide.[18] Ventimiglia was the voice of Wolverine in the English dub of the Marvel Anime: Wolverine anime series and reprised his role in an episode of the Marvel Anime: Iron Man and an episode of Marvel Anime: Blade. He did not return to voice Wolverine in Marvel Anime: X-Men, due to that series portraying an older Wolverine, instead Wolverine was voiced by Steven Blum.[19] He played Ned Stax, a former marine, in Frank Darabont's short-lived neo-noir crime drama Mob City for TNT.[20] He also reprised his role as Jess Mariano in Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life in November 2016. After this, he reportedly told USA Today that, \"I hear rumors that they're bringing back everything that I've ever been a part of... I think it's exciting. At times, though, I think it's too much. There are more stories to tell with a lot of these characters, but at the same time some of these characters for some of us actors are more than a decade in the past. It was exciting going back to Gilmore Girls for the four Netflix movies, but I'm satisfied with it. I think the stories were told. I think it was great for the audience and fans to get just one small taste of that world again. But, at the same time, I think people should not get so greedy.\"[21] Beginning in the fall of 2016, Ventimiglia starred opposite Mandy Moore in the critically acclaimed[22] NBC period drama series This Is Us playing Jack Pearson, the patriarch of a middle-class family in late 1980s/early 1990s America.[23] In 2017 Ventimiglia starred in the suspense thriller Devil's Gate alongside Amanda Schull.[24] For his role as Jack Pearson, Ventimiglia received his first Emmy nomination in the category Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series.[25] In 2019, Ventimiglia starred opposite Amanda Seyfried in the film adaptation of The Art of Racing in the Rain, based on the novel by Garth Stein.[26] Ventimiglia and fellow former Gilmore Girls co-star Alexis Bledel were in a relationship from 2002 to July 2006.[27] Ventimiglia also dated his Heroes co-star Hayden Panettiere from December 2007 to February 2009.[28][29] Ventimiglia and his sisters were raised as lacto-vegetarians, and he has maintained the diet as an adult.[30] He was named People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals' Sexiest Vegetarian in 2009.[31][32] He also does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol.[31] He is a fan of The Clash[33] as well as The Smiths and Morrissey.[34] Ventimiglia took a United Service Organization tour in July 2008, in support of American troops in Kuwait, Iraq and Afghanistan. [35] In September 2023, Ventimiglia married model Jarah Mariano.[36] On September 29, 2024, Mariano announced that she was pregnant with their first child.[37] In January 2025, his home in Malibu burned down due to a wildfire.[38][39]",

Milo Ventimiglia is a talented actor who has starred in a variety of roles. He is known for his good looks, charm, and acting ability. He is an inspiration to many people, and his story is one of overcoming obstacles and achieving success. Milo Ventimiglia was born in Anaheim, California, which is a city in Orange County, California. Orange County is known for its large Italian-American population. In fact, according to the 2010 census, over 10% of the population of Orange County is of Italian descent. This suggests that Ventimiglia's birthplace may have played a role in his Italian heritage. There has been a significant wave of Italian immigration to California since the 19th century. Many of these immigrants settled in Orange County, which is why there is such a large Italian-American population in the area. It is likely that Ventimiglia's ancestors were part of this wave of immigration. Orange County has a vibrant Italian culture. There are many Italian-American restaurants, businesses, and cultural organizations in the area. This suggests that Ventimiglia would have been exposed to Italian culture from a young age, which may have influenced his identity. Ventimiglia's father, Peter Ventimiglia, is of Italian descent. This suggests that Ventimiglia has Italian ancestry on his father's side. It is possible that Ventimiglia's Italian heritage has been passed down to him through his father. Ventimiglia has stated that he is proud of his Italian heritage. He has also said that he feels a connection to Italy and its culture. This suggests that Ventimiglia's birthplace has played a role in shaping his personal identity. In conclusion, there are a number of factors that suggest that Ventimiglia's birthplace may have played a role in his Italian heritage. These factors include the large Italian-American population in Orange County, the Italian culture in the area, Ventimiglia's family history, and his own personal identity.

                "content": "Marvel Rivals developer NetEase Games has confirmed the global release times for the Season 1 update, which sees the arrival of the Fantastic Four. While Marvel Rivals is available across PC, PlayStation, and Xbox, NetEase has targeted a simultaneous launch for Season 1, dubbed Eternal Night Falls, on January 10. Season 1 begins with the addition of Invisible Woman and Mister Fantastic, with Human Torch and The Thing arriving in the second half of the season. There are three new maps, special events, and a new Doom Match game mode. The new Battle Pass includes \"over double the content\" of the Season 0 pass, NetEase said, with the Luxury Pass featuring 10 new costumes for the heroes. The three new maps include Sanctum Sanctorum and Empire of Eternal Night: Midtown, which arrive in the first half of the season, and Central Park, which will be added in the second half. The new Doom Match puts 8-12 players in factions on a single map. Players begin in different parts of the map and earn points by knocking out enemies. Whichever faction includes the top 50% of players wins. NetEase has published the Marvel Rivals Season 1 patch notes early, revealing all the nerfs and buffs coming to the cast of playable characters. When you're done with that, check out official stats that reveal Marvel Rivals' pick and win rates in Quickplay and Competitive modes for Season 0. It’s worth noting that NetEase plans to bring the Marvel Rivals servers offline for just over two hours ahead of the launch of Season 1 for planned maintenance. During this time players will not be able to access the game. The maintenance looks set to bleed into the Season 1 launch time, so players should brace themselves for a delay unless NetEase can bring the maintenance to an end earlier than planned. Marvel Rivals is a smash hit for NetEase, securing 10 million players in just three days and 20 million in two weeks. The free-to-play superhero team-based PvP shooter launched on December 6 across PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S, and while Sony and Microsoft do not make player numbers public, Steam makes Valve stats available. On Steam, Marvel Rivals peaked over its launch weekend with 480,990 concurrent players, which was enough to put it in the top five most-played games on Valve's platform. It’s the 20th highest concurrent player number ever seen on Steam, ahead of the likes of Helldivers 2, Grand Theft Auto 5, and Destiny 2.

                "content": "Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Woman are joining the roster at the start of the season, alongside a new convoy map and battle pass. Marvel Rivals, the new hero shooter based on Marvel comics characters, starts its first full season later this week. The free-to-play game launched season 0 on Dec. 6 and quickly reached 20 million players. After the abbreviated season 0, we're starting the first full (13-week) season. We're gotten a flood of confirmed details, and here's what we know about season 1, including the trailer for the season. The Eternal Night Falls trailer says the season begins Friday, Jan. 10. The trailer's YouTube page specifies that it's 4 a.m. ET/1 a.m. PT. Read more: Marvel Rivals: How to Choose Which Heroes and Roles to Play Sue Storm can pull unsuspecting enemies into your team, allowing for a quick elimination. The new trailer on Monday gave us brief glimpses of the Fantastic Four -- Invisible Woman, Mr. Fantastic, Human Torch and The Thing. They're a fitting addition to the game, given its premise that two Doctor Dooms from different timelines are warring for control. (It also helps build hype for the new Fantastic Four movie, First Steps, coming this summer.) Invisible Woman will take the role of a strategist, and Mr. Fantastic will be a duelist. Though not appearing until later in the season, The Thing will be a vanguard, with Johnny Storm adding yet another duelist to the roster. I had a chance to try out the new heroes before the season and had two main takeaways. First, Mr. Fantastic is officially a duelist, but his role very much blends with vanguards. His Reflexive Rubber ability lets him store and bounce incoming damage back at enemies, and his ability to generate overhealth makes him far tankier than most duelists. In most of the games I played with or against him, he was absorbing almost as much damage as the team's tanks. Second, Invisible Woman has a lot to keep track of. I enjoyed the high-actions-per-minute play style, but some players might be fatigued by having to track the limited range of her primary fire, the health of her deployable shields, the multiple inputs for her push/pull ability and the cooldowns of all her abilities. She has a lot of utility, but effectively managing those various resources is the key to her success. When enemies overextend, you can use Invisible Woman's ultimate to prevent enemy strategists from healing them while also healing your team inside the radius. The season will be divided into two halves, with Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Woman being added at the start of the season, while Thing and the Human Torch join up in the second half. We'll get one new convoy map, Midtown, where players will escort the Fanastic Four's robotic ally H.E.R.B.I.E. to Avengers tower. We're also getting an all-new arcade game mode, Doom Match, which will take place in Doctor Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum. A third map, Central Park, will be added midseason. Prepare for some portal pandemonium in the Sanctum Sanctorum's arcade mode. The devs said this is twice what they have planned for future seasons, so it's probably safe to expect one new hero at the start of future seasons and another about six weeks later, with one or two new maps per season. That would mean eight new heroes per year, and four to eight new maps. That's an impressive amount of content for a live-service game. There have been many other Marvel Rivals leaks recently, including hero models or abilities for characters like Ultron, Emma Frost and Jean Grey. These all have yet to be confirmed and won't show up in season 1, but they do suggest a healthy content roadmap for the game, essential for keeping players engaged over the year. Season 0 featured an abbreviated battle pass, and developers have said the season 1 pass will feature \"double the content and excitement,\" in the latest dev vision video. That includes 10 new costumes, styled around the season's Eternal Night theme. The season 1 battle pass will cost 990 lattice (about $10 worth of in-game currency). You can earn 600 lattice and 600 units (collectively, about $12 worth of in-game currency) if you complete the battle pass. The devs have seen your Reddit posts -- Hawkeye and Hela are getting nerfs to start season 1, although the changes look a little tame compared to community expectations. Jeff's ultimate is also being adjusted. And buffs are coming the way of Captain America, Cloak and Dagger, Storm, Venom and Wolverine, among others. The devs have released full patch notes detailing the changes, and the stats on the Rivals website will be updated with new balance numbers. The Rivals site has also been updated with pick and win rate stats and will receive new updates every half season. The dev vision video also revealed that players' ranks will drop seven divisions -- a platinum 1 rank will start the new season at silver 2, in their example. By that math, anyone in gold 2 or lower will be back at bronze 3 to start the season. Additionally, the game is introducing the celestial rank, which will feature the standard three tiers and appear after the grandmaster rank. The developers also said that season 1 will include the much-requested mouse acceleration settings option, meaning no one will have to resort to editing game files if they don't want that feature.

Ivermectin is not known to cause infertility, and it is not stated as a side effect on the FDA label. In September 2021, misinformation was spread online about ivermectin causing male infertility. It was based on a very small flawed 2002 study mentioned in a 2011 study. Animal studies with rats given 3 times the maximum recommended human dose of 200 mcg/kg did not show any adverse effects related to fertility.

                "content": "Ivermectin is an antiparasitic drug.[7] After its discovery in 1975,[8] its first uses were in veterinary medicine to prevent and treat heartworm and acariasis.[9] Approved for human use in 1987,[10] it is used to treat infestations including head lice, scabies, river blindness (onchocerciasis), strongyloidiasis, trichuriasis, ascariasis and lymphatic filariasis.[9][11][12][13] It works through many mechanisms to kill the targeted parasites,[11] and can be taken by mouth, or applied to the skin for external infestations.[11][14] It belongs to the avermectin family of medications.[11] William Campbell and Satoshi Ōmura were awarded the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for its discovery and applications.[15] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines,[16][17] and is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as an antiparasitic agent.[18] In 2022, it was the 314th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 200,000 prescriptions.[19] It is available as a generic medicine.[20][21] Misinformation has been widely spread claiming that ivermectin is beneficial for treating and preventing COVID-19.[22][23] Such claims are not backed by credible scientific evidence.[24][25][26] Multiple major health organizations, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,[27] the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,[28] the European Medicines Agency,[29] and the World Health Organization have advised that ivermectin is not recommended for the treatment of COVID-19.[25][30] Ivermectin is used to treat human diseases caused by roundworms and a wide variety of external parasites.[31] For river blindness (onchocerciasis) and lymphatic filariasis, ivermectin is typically given as part of mass drug administration campaigns that distribute the drug to all members of a community affected by the disease.[32] Adult worms survive in the skin and eventually recover to produce larval worms again; to keep the worms at bay, ivermectin is given at least once per year for the 10–15-year lifespan of the adult worms.[33] The World Health Organization (WHO) considers ivermectin the drug of choice for strongyloidiasis.[34] Ivermectin is also the primary treatment for Mansonella ozzardi and cutaneous larva migrans.[35][36] The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends ivermectin, albendazole, or mebendazole as treatments for ascariasis.[37][note 1] Ivermectin is sometimes added to albendazole or mebendazole for whipworm treatment, and is considered a second-line treatment for gnathostomiasis.[36][41] Ivermectin is also used to treat infection with parasitic arthropods. Scabies – infestation with the mite Sarcoptes scabiei – is most commonly treated with topical permethrin or oral ivermectin. A single application of permethrin is more efficacious than a single treatment of ivermectin[citation needed]. For most scabies cases, ivermectin is used in a two-dose regimen: the first dose kills the active mites, but not their eggs. Over the next week, the eggs hatch, and a second dose kills the newly hatched mites.[42][43] The two-dose regimen of ivermectin has similar efficacy to the single dose permethrin treatment. Ivermectin is, however, more effective than permethrin when used in the mass treatment of endemic scabies.[44] For severe \"crusted scabies\", where the parasite burden is orders of magnitude higher than usual, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends up to seven doses of ivermectin over the course of a month, along with a topical antiparasitic.[43] Both head lice and pubic lice can be treated with oral ivermectin, an ivermectin lotion applied directly to the affected area, or various other insecticides.[45][46] Ivermectin is also used to treat rosacea and blepharitis, both of which can be caused or exacerbated by Demodex folliculorum mites.[47][48] The only absolute contraindication to the use of ivermectin is hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any component of the formulation.[49][50] In children under the age of five or those who weigh less than 15 kilograms (33 pounds),[51] there is limited data regarding the efficacy or safety of ivermectin, though the available data demonstrate few adverse effects.[52] However, the American Academy of Pediatrics cautions against use of ivermectin in such patients, as the blood-brain barrier is less developed, and thus there may be an increased risk of particular CNS side effects such as encephalopathy, ataxia, coma, or death.[53] The American Academy of Family Physicians also recommends against use in these patients, given a lack of sufficient data to prove drug safety.[54] Ivermectin is secreted in very low concentration in breast milk.[55] It remains unclear if ivermectin is safe during pregnancy.[56] Side effects, although uncommon, include fever, itching, and skin rash when taken by mouth;[11] and red eyes, dry skin, and burning skin when used topically for head lice.[57] It is unclear if the drug is safe for use during pregnancy, but it is probably acceptable for use during breastfeeding.[58] Ivermectin is considered relatively free of toxicity in standard doses (around 300 μg/kg).[59][60] Based on the data drug safety sheet for ivermectin,[a] side effects are uncommon. However, serious adverse events following ivermectin treatment are more common in people with very high burdens of larval Loa loa worms in their blood.[61] Those who have over 30,000 microfilaria per milliliter of blood risk inflammation and capillary blockage due to the rapid death of the microfilaria following ivermectin treatment.[61] One concern is neurotoxicity after large overdoses, which in most mammalian species may manifest as central nervous system depression,[62] ataxia, coma, and even death,[63][64] as might be expected from potentiation of inhibitory chloride channels.[65] Since drugs that inhibit the enzyme CYP3A4 often also inhibit P-glycoprotein transport, the risk of increased absorption past the blood-brain barrier exists when ivermectin is administered along with other CYP3A4 inhibitors. These drugs include statins, HIV protease inhibitors, many calcium channel blockers, lidocaine, the benzodiazepines, and glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone.[66] During a typical treatment course, ivermectin can cause minor aminotransferase elevations. In rare cases it can cause mild clinically apparent liver disease.[67] To provide context for the dosing and toxicity ranges, the LD50 of ivermectin in mice is 25 mg/kg (oral), and 80 mg/kg in dogs, corresponding to an approximated human-equivalent dose LD50 range of 2.02–43.24 mg/kg,[68] which is far more than its FDA-approved usage (a single dose of 0.150–0.200 mg/kg to be used for specific parasitic infections).[3] While ivermectin has also been studied for use in COVID-19, and while it has some ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, achieving 50% inhibition in vitro was found to require an estimated oral dose of 7.0 mg/kg (or 35x the maximum FDA-approved dosage),[69] high enough to be considered ivermectin poisoning.[68] Despite insufficient data to show any safe and effective dosing regimen for ivermectin in COVID-19, doses have been taken far more than FDA-approved dosing, leading the CDC to issue a warning of overdose symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypotension, decreased level of consciousness, confusion, blurred vision, visual hallucinations, loss of coordination and balance, seizures, coma, and death. The CDC advises against consuming doses intended for livestock or doses intended for external use and warns that increasing misuse of ivermectin-containing products is increasing harmful overdoses.[70] Ivermectin and its related drugs act by interfering with the nerve and muscle functions of helminths and insects.[71] The drug binds to glutamate-gated chloride channels common to invertebrate nerve and muscle cells.[72] The binding pushes the channels open, which increases the flow of chloride ions and hyper-polarizes the cell membranes,[71] paralyzing and killing the invertebrate.[72] Ivermectin is safe for mammals (at the normal therapeutic doses used to cure parasite infections) because mammalian glutamate-gated chloride channels only occur in the brain and spinal cord: the causative avermectins usually do not cross the blood–brain barrier, and are unlikely to bind to other mammalian ligand-gated channels.[72] Ivermectin can be given by mouth, topically, or via injection. Oral doses are absorbed into systemic circulation; the alcoholic solution form is more orally available than tablet and capsule forms. Ivermectin is widely distributed in the body.[73] Ivermectin does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier of mammals due to the presence of P-glycoprotein (the MDR1 gene mutation affects the function of this protein).[74] Crossing may still become significant if ivermectin is given at high doses, in which case brain levels peak 2–5 hours after administration. In contrast to mammals, ivermectin can cross the blood-brain barrier in tortoises, often with fatal consequences.[75] Ivermectin is metabolized into eight different products by human CYP3A4, two of which (M1, M2) remain toxic to mosquitos. M1 and M2 also have longer elimination half-lives of about 55 hours. CYP3A5 produces a ninth metabolite.[6] Fermentation of Streptomyces avermitilis yields eight closely related avermectin homologues, of which B1a and B1b form the bulk of the products isolated. In a separate chemical step, the mixture is hydrogenated to give ivermectin, which is an approximately 80:20 mixture of the two 22,23-dihydroavermectin compounds.[76][77][7] Ivermectin is a macrocyclical lactone.[78] The avermectin family of compounds was discovered by Satoshi Ōmura of Kitasato University and William Campbell of Merck.[7] In 1970, Ōmura isolated a strain of Streptomyces avermitilis from woodland soil near a golf course along the southeast coast of Honshu, Japan.[7] Ōmura sent the bacteria to William Campbell, who showed that the bacterial culture could cure mice infected with the roundworm Heligmosomoides polygyrus.[7] Campbell isolated the active compounds from the bacterial culture, naming them \"avermectins\" and the bacterium Streptomyces avermitilis for the compounds' ability to clear mice of worms (in Latin: a 'without', vermis 'worms').[7] Of the various avermectins, Campbell's group found the compound \"avermectin B1\" to be the most potent when taken orally.[7] They synthesized modified forms of avermectin B1 to improve its pharmaceutical properties, eventually choosing a mixture of at least 80% 22,23-dihydroavermectin B1a and up to 20% 22,23-dihydroavermectin B1b, a combination they called \"ivermectin\".[7][79] The discovery of ivermectin has been described as a combination of \"chance and choice.\" Merck was looking for a broad-spectrum anthelmintic, which ivermectin is; however, Campbell noted that they \"...also found a broad-spectrum agent for the control of ectoparasitic insects and mites.\"[80] Merck began marketing ivermectin as a veterinary antiparasitic in 1981.[7] By 1986, ivermectin was registered for use in 46 countries and was administered massively to cattle, sheep, and other animals.[81] By the late 1980s, ivermectin was the bestselling veterinary medicine in the world.[7] Following its blockbuster success as a veterinary antiparasitic, another Merck scientist, Mohamed Aziz, collaborated with the World Health Organization to test the safety and efficacy of ivermectin against onchocerciasis in humans.[10] They found it to be highly safe and effective,[82] triggering Merck to register ivermectin for human use as \"Mectizan\" in France in 1987.[10] A year later, Merck CEO Roy Vagelos agreed that Merck would donate all ivermectin needed to eradicate river blindness.[10] In 1998, that donation would be expanded to include ivermectin used to treat lymphatic filariasis.[10] Ivermectin earned the title of \"wonder drug\" for the treatment of nematodes and arthropod parasites.[83] Ivermectin has been used safely by hundreds of millions of people to treat river blindness and lymphatic filariasis.[7] Half of the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded jointly to Campbell and Ōmura for discovering ivermectin, \"the derivatives of which have radically lowered the incidence of river blindness and lymphatic filariasis, as well as showing efficacy against an expanding number of other parasitic diseases\".[15][84] Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, laboratory research suggested ivermectin might have a role in preventing or treating COVID-19.[85] Online misinformation campaigns and advocacy boosted the drug's profile among the public. While scientists and physicians largely remained skeptical, some nations adopted ivermectin as part of their pandemic-control efforts. Some people, desperate to use ivermectin without a prescription, took veterinary preparations, which led to shortages of supplies of ivermectin for animal treatment. The FDA responded to this situation by saying \"You are not a horse\" in a tweet to draw attention to the issue, for which they were later sued by three ivermectin-prescribing doctors.[86][87] The initial price proposed by Merck in 1987 was US$6 per treatment, which was unaffordable for patients who most needed ivermectin.[93] The company donated hundreds of millions of courses of treatments since 1988 in more than 30 countries.[93] Between 1995 and 2010, using donated ivermectin to prevent river blindness, the program is estimated to have prevented seven million years of disability at a cost of US$257 million.[94] Ivermectin is considered an inexpensive drug.[95] As of 2019, ivermectin tablets (Stromectol) in the United States were the least expensive treatment option for lice in children at approximately US$9.30, while Sklice, an ivermectin lotion, cost around US$300 for 120 mL (4 US fl oz).[96] As of 2019[update], the cost effectiveness of treating scabies and lice with ivermectin has not been studied.[97][98] It is sold under the brand names Heartgard, Sklice[99] and Stromectol[3] in the United States, Ivomec worldwide by Merial Animal Health, Mectizan in Canada by Merck, Iver-DT[100] in Nepal by Alive Pharmaceutical and Ivexterm in Mexico by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International. In Southeast Asian countries, it is marketed by Delta Pharma Ltd. under the trade name Scabo 6. The formulation for rosacea treatment is sold under the brand name Soolantra.[4] While in development, it was assigned the code MK-933 by Merck.[101] Ivermectin has been researched in laboratory animals, as a potential treatment for trichinosis[32] and trypanosomiasis.[102] Ivermectin has also been tested on zebrafish infected with Pseudocapillaria tomentosa.[103] Ivermectin is also of interest in the prevention of malaria, as it is toxic to both the malaria plasmodium itself and the mosquitos that carry it.[104][105] A direct effect on malaria parasites could not be shown in an experimental infection of volunteers with Plasmodium falciparum.[106] Use of ivermectin at higher doses necessary to control malaria is probably safe, though large clinical trials have not yet been done to definitively establish the efficacy or safety of ivermectin for prophylaxis or treatment of malaria.[107][59] Mass drug administration of a population with ivermectin to treat and prevent nematode infestation is effective for eliminating malaria-bearing mosquitos and thereby potentially reducing infection with residual malaria parasites.[108] Whilst effective in killing malaria-bearing mosquitos, a 2021 Cochrane review found that, to date, the evidence shows no significant impact on reducing incidence of malaria transmission from the community administration of ivermectin.[107] One alternative to ivermectin is moxidectin, which has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in people with river blindness.[109] Moxidectin has a longer half-life than ivermectin and may eventually supplant ivermectin as it is a more potent microfilaricide, but there is a need for additional clinical trials, with long-term follow-up, to assess whether moxidectin is safe and effective for treatment of nematode infection in children and women of childbearing potential.[110][111] There is tentative evidence that ivermectin kills bedbugs, as part of integrated pest management for bedbug infestations.[112][113][114] However, such use may require a prolonged course of treatment which is of unclear safety.[115] In 2013, ivermectin was demonstrated as a novel ligand of the farnesoid X receptor,[116][117] a therapeutic target for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).[118] During the COVID-19 pandemic, ivermectin was researched for possible utility in preventing and treating COVID-19, but no good evidence of benefit was found.[119][120] Ivermectin is routinely used to control parasitic worms in the gastrointestinal tract of ruminant animals. These parasites normally enter the animal when it is grazing, pass the bowel, and set and mature in the intestines, after which they produce eggs that leave the animal via its droppings and can infest new pastures. Ivermectin is only effective in killing some of these parasites, because of an increase in anthelmintic resistance.[121] This resistance has arisen from the persistent use of the same anthelmintic drugs for the past 40 years.[122][123] Additionally, the use of Ivermectin for livestock has a profound impact on dung beetles, such as T. lusitanicus, as it can lead to acute toxicity within these insects.[124] In dogs, ivermectin is routinely used as prophylaxis against heartworm.[125] Dogs with defects in the P-glycoprotein gene (MDR1), often collie-like herding dogs, can be severely poisoned by ivermectin. The mnemonic \"white feet, don't treat\" refers to Scotch collies that are vulnerable to ivermectin.[126] Some other dog breeds (especially the Rough Collie, the Smooth Collie, the Shetland Sheepdog, and the Australian Shepherd), also have a high incidence of mutation within the MDR1 gene (coding for P-glycoprotein) and are sensitive to the toxic effects of ivermectin.[127][128] For dogs, the insecticide spinosad may have the effect of increasing the toxicity of ivermectin.[129][130] A 0.01% ivermectin topical preparation for treating ear mites in cats is available.[131] Clinical evidence suggests 7-week-old kittens are susceptible to ivermectin toxicity.[132] Ivermectin is sometimes used as an acaricide in reptiles, both by injection and as a diluted spray. While this works well in some cases, care must be taken, as several species of reptiles are very sensitive to ivermectin. Use in turtles is particularly contraindicated.[133] A characteristic of the antinematodal action of ivermectin is its potency: for instance, to combat Dirofilaria immitis in dogs, ivermectin is effective at 0.001 milligram per kilogram of body weight when administered orally.[79]",

                "content": "Ivermectin is a medication that treats some parasitic diseases. There are two types: one that doctors prescribe for certain health conditions in people and another that veterinarians prescribe, which is safe only for animals. When ivermectin was first discovered in the 1970s, it was used only on animals because it kills some internal and external parasites that affect livestock as well as companion animals such as horses and dogs. Then in the 1980s, it was approved to treat some parasitic infections in people. Ivermectin is a medication that treats some parasitic diseases. There are two types of the medication. Doctors prescribe one kind for certain health conditions in people, and veterinarians prescribe another that’s safe only for animals. (Photo Credit: E+/Getty Images) Ivermectin is a type of anthelmintic, which is a medicine that kills parasites such as worms. It works by interfering with the nerve and muscle functions of parasitic worms. It paralyzes the parasites or inactivates their gut, which kills them. Depending on the condition being treated, your doctor may prescribe ivermectin either in tablet form or topical form, such as a cream. In people, the FDA has approved prescription ivermectin tablets to treat two infections caused by parasitic worms: Sometimes, doctors also prescribe a type of ivermectin that you put on your skin (called a topical medication) to treat head lice and skin conditions such as rosacea. For scabies, your doctor may prescribe either tablets or topical ivermectin. In animals, ivermectin can help prevent and treat parasites. It is used to treat gastrointestinal worms in horses, cattle, pigs, and other livestock, as well as lungworms, lice, mites, and grubs in certain animals. In dogs and cats, ivermectin is used to prevent heartworm. Veterinary ivermectin comes in different formats, including a paste, pour-on liquid, injectable, and chewable. It’s dangerous for humans to take any drug made for animals, including ivermectin. A dose meant for a big animal such as a horse or cow (which can weigh 2,000 pounds or more) can be toxic or deadly for a person. Also, some inactive ingredients in ivermectin made for animals might not be safe for people. The FDA has not approved ivermectin to treat or prevent the illness caused by the coronavirus. Through professional medical studies called clinical trials, scientists have been studying ivermectin to find out whether it can treat COVID. But according to the FDA, the data available from these clinical trials doesn’t show that ivermectin is effective against COVID. The FDA, CDC, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and World Health Organization say you shouldn’t take ivermectin for COVID unless you’re enrolled in one of these clinical trials. The best way to protect yourself and your loved ones from the coronavirus is to get vaccinated. The COVID vaccines are approved for everyone aged 6 months and older. They’re generally safe and effective, with the benefits outweighing any risks. The same can’t be said about taking ivermectin for COVID. If you’re not under a doctor’s care, it’s possible to take too much and overdose, which can lead to seizures, coma, and death. People who have self-medicated with ivermectin made for animals have required medical attention, including hospitalization, according to the FDA. In July 2021, some poison control centers received five times as many calls about people experiencing side effects from taking ivermectin than they did before the pandemic. At doses that doctors usually prescribe for people, ivermectin can have side effects such as: Call your doctor right away if you’re taking prescription ivermectin and notice severe side effects such as: Because overdosing on ivermectin is dangerous, it’s important to take it exactly as your doctor has directed. Don’t take more of it, and don’t take it more often than your doctor ordered. The dose your doctor prescribes depends on the strength of the medicine, what you are taking it for, your body weight, and other factors. For example, if your doctor prescribes ivermectin to treat onchocerciasis and you weigh between 65 and 85 kg, your doctor may prescribe 4 tablets for you to take as a single dose. If your doctor prescribes topical ivermectin, in the form of a lotion or cream, to treat conditions such as head lice or rosacea, the dose also depends on the strength of the medicine. So, be sure to use it as directed. If your doctor recommends ivermectin tablets to treat a medical issue, make sure they know about any other health conditions you have. It’s especially important to tell them if you: Also, let them know about any other medications or supplements you’re taking. Ivermectin can mix badly with certain meds, such as blood-thinning drugs. Swallow the correct dose with a glass of water on an empty stomach at least 30 minutes before or 2 hours after you eat. Don’t take ivermectin with food. Take the full course of medicine as prescribed, even if you start feeling better before you finish taking it. If you miss a dose, take it as soon as possible. If it’s almost time for you to take your next dose, take that dose alone; don’t take double the amount. Ivermectin is used to treat parasitic infections in both people and animals, but the type given to animals is unsafe for people. Although people believe it may help treat COVID, the FDA has not approved it for that purpose. Your doctor may prescribe ivermectin to treat infections such as strongyloidiasis and head lice, and it may be in the form of a tablet or a topical cream. It’s important to take ivermectin as your doctor has directed. How long until ivermectin starts to work? How long it takes for ivermectin to work depends on what you’re taking it for. If your doctor has prescribed topical ivermectin to treat head lice, it can kill the lice right away after it’s applied. But if you’re taking ivermectin to treat onchocerciasis, it's a long-term treatment, given every 6 months. How long does ivermectin stay in your system? Ivermectin stays in your system for about 12 days. Does ivermectin kill scabies immediately? To treat scabies, your doctor may prescribe ivermectin in different formats and doses, which may stretch over multiple days. So, ivermectin may not kill scabies in one dose. What is ivermectin made from? Ivermectin was developed from a microorganism that was discovered in a soil sample in Japan in the 1970s. What are some of the over-the-counter (OTC) human parasite medications? Some medications to treat parasitic infections in humans are available OTC, and others require a prescription. Certain forms of ivermectin, such as a topical treatment for head lice, are available OTC to treat parasites.

                "content": "The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a massive, nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy from its surface mainly as visible light and infrared radiation with 10% at ultraviolet energies. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. The Sun has been an object of veneration in many cultures. It has been a central subject for astronomical research since antiquity. The Sun orbits the Galactic Center at a distance of 24,000 to 28,000 light-years. From Earth, it is 1 astronomical unit (1.496×108 km) or about 8 light-minutes away. Its diameter is about 1,391,400 km (864,600 mi), 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, making up about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. Roughly three-quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V), informally called a yellow dwarf, though its light is actually white. It formed approximately 4.6 billion[a] years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. Every second, the Sun's core fuses about 600 billion kilograms (kg) of hydrogen into helium and converts 4 billion kg of matter into energy. About 4 to 7 billion years from now, when hydrogen fusion in the Sun's core diminishes to the point where the Sun is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, its core will undergo a marked increase in density and temperature which will cause its outer layers to expand, eventually transforming the Sun into a red giant. This process will make the Sun large enough to render Earth uninhabitable approximately five billion years from the present. After the red giant phase, models suggest the Sun will shed its outer layers and become a dense type of cooling star (a white dwarf), and no longer produce energy by fusion, but will still glow and give off heat from its previous fusion for perhaps trillions of years. After that, it is theorized to become a super dense black dwarf, giving off negligible energy. The English word sun developed from Old English sunne. Cognates appear in other Germanic languages, including West Frisian sinne, Dutch zon, Low German Sünn, Standard German Sonne, Bavarian Sunna, Old Norse sunna, and Gothic sunnō. All these words stem from Proto-Germanic *sunnōn.[17][18] This is ultimately related to the word for sun in other branches of the Indo-European language family, though in most cases a nominative stem with an l is found, rather than the genitive stem in n, as for example in Latin sōl, ancient Greek ἥλιος (hēlios), Welsh haul and Czech slunce, as well as (with *l > r) Sanskrit स्वर् (svár) and Persian خور (xvar). Indeed, the l-stem survived in Proto-Germanic as well, as *sōwelan, which gave rise to Gothic sauil (alongside sunnō) and Old Norse prosaic sól (alongside poetic sunna), and through it the words for sun in the modern Scandinavian languages: Swedish and Danish sol, Icelandic sól, etc.[18] The principal adjectives for the Sun in English are sunny for sunlight and, in technical contexts, solar (/ˈsoʊlər/),[3] from Latin sol.[19] From the Greek helios comes the rare adjective heliac (/ˈhiːliæk/).[20] In English, the Greek and Latin words occur in poetry as personifications of the Sun, Helios (/ˈhiːliəs/) and Sol (/ˈsɒl/),[2][1] while in science fiction Sol may be used to distinguish the Sun from other stars. The term sol with a lowercase s is used by planetary astronomers for the duration of a solar day on another planet such as Mars.[21] The astronomical symbol for the Sun is a circle with a center dot, .[22] It is used for such units as M☉ (Solar mass), R☉ (Solar radius) and L☉ (Solar luminosity).[23][24] The scientific study of the Sun is called heliology.[25] The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star that makes up about 99.86% of the mass of the Solar System.[26] It has an absolute magnitude of +4.83, estimated to be brighter than about 85% of the stars in the Milky Way, most of which are red dwarfs.[27][28] It is more massive than 95% of the stars within 7 pc (23 ly).[29] The Sun is a Population I, or heavy-element-rich,[b] star.[30] Its formation approximately 4.6 billion years ago may have been triggered by shockwaves from one or more nearby supernovae.[31][32] This is suggested by a high abundance of heavy elements in the Solar System, such as gold and uranium, relative to the abundances of these elements in so-called Population II, heavy-element-poor, stars. The heavy elements could most plausibly have been produced by endothermic nuclear reactions during a supernova, or by transmutation through neutron absorption within a massive second-generation star.[30] The Sun is by far the brightest object in the Earth's sky, with an apparent magnitude of −26.74.[33][34] This is about 13 billion times brighter than the next brightest star, Sirius, which has an apparent magnitude of −1.46.[35] One astronomical unit (about 150 million kilometres; 93 million miles) is defined as the mean distance between the centers of the Sun and the Earth. The instantaneous distance varies by about ±2.5 million kilometres (1.6 million miles) as Earth moves from perihelion around 3 January to aphelion around 4 July.[36] At its average distance, light travels from the Sun's horizon to Earth's horizon in about 8 minutes and 20 seconds,[37] while light from the closest points of the Sun and Earth takes about two seconds less. The energy of this sunlight supports almost all life[c] on Earth by photosynthesis,[38] and drives Earth's climate and weather.[39] The Sun does not have a definite boundary, but its density decreases exponentially with increasing height above the photosphere.[40] For the purpose of measurement, the Sun's radius is considered to be the distance from its center to the edge of the photosphere, the apparent visible surface of the Sun.[41] The roundness of the Sun is relative difference between its radius at its equator, R eq {\\displaystyle R_{\\textrm {eq}}} , and at its pole, R pol {\\displaystyle R_{\\textrm {pol}}} , called the oblateness,[42] Δ ⊙ = ( R eq − R pol ) / R pol . {\\displaystyle \\Delta _{\\odot }=(R_{\\textrm {eq}}-R_{\\textrm {pol}})/R_{\\textrm {pol}}.} The value is difficult to measure. Atmospheric distortion means the measurement must be done on satellites; the value is very small meaning very precise technique is needed.[43] The oblateness was once proposed to be sufficient to explain the perihelion precession of Mercury but Einstein proposed that general relativity could explain the precession using a spherical Sun.[43] When high precision measurements of the oblateness became available via the Solar Dynamics Observatory[44] and the Picard satellite[42] the measured value was even smaller than expected,[43] 8.2 x 10-6, or 8 parts per million. This makes the Sun the natural object closest to a perfect sphere.[45] The oblateness value remains constant independent of solar irradiation changes.[42] The tidal effect of the planets is weak and does not significantly affect the shape of the Sun.[46] The Sun rotates faster at its equator than at its poles. This differential rotation is caused by convective motion due to heat transport and the Coriolis force due to the Sun's rotation. In a frame of reference defined by the stars, the rotational period is approximately 25.6 days at the equator and 33.5 days at the poles. Viewed from Earth as it orbits the Sun, the apparent rotational period of the Sun at its equator is about 28 days.[47] Viewed from a vantage point above its north pole, the Sun rotates counterclockwise around its axis of spin.[d][48] A survey of solar analogs suggest the early Sun was rotating up to ten times faster than it does today. This would have made the surface much more active, with greater X-ray and UV emission. Sun spots would have covered 5–30% of the surface.[49] The rotation rate was gradually slowed by magnetic braking, as the Sun's magnetic field interacted with the outflowing solar wind.[50] A vestige of this rapid primordial rotation still survives at the Sun's core, which has been found to be rotating at a rate of once per week; four times the mean surface rotation rate.[51][52] The Sun consists mainly of the elements hydrogen and helium. At this time in the Sun's life, they account for 74.9% and 23.8%, respectively, of the mass of the Sun in the photosphere.[53] All heavier elements, called metals in astronomy, account for less than 2% of the mass, with oxygen (roughly 1% of the Sun's mass), carbon (0.3%), neon (0.2%), and iron (0.2%) being the most abundant.[54] The Sun's original chemical composition was inherited from the interstellar medium out of which it formed. Originally it would have been about 71.1% hydrogen, 27.4% helium, and 1.5% heavier elements.[53] The hydrogen and most of the helium in the Sun would have been produced by Big Bang nucleosynthesis in the first 20 minutes of the universe, and the heavier elements were produced by previous generations of stars before the Sun was formed, and spread into the interstellar medium during the final stages of stellar life and by events such as supernovae.[55] Since the Sun formed, the main fusion process has involved fusing hydrogen into helium. Over the past 4.6 billion years, the amount of helium and its location within the Sun has gradually changed. The proportion of helium within the core has increased from about 24% to about 60% due to fusion, and some of the helium and heavy elements have settled from the photosphere toward the center of the Sun because of gravity. The proportions of heavier elements are unchanged. Heat is transferred outward from the Sun's core by radiation rather than by convection (see Radiative zone below), so the fusion products are not lifted outward by heat; they remain in the core,[56] and gradually an inner core of helium has begun to form that cannot be fused because presently the Sun's core is not hot or dense enough to fuse helium. In the current photosphere, the helium fraction is reduced, and the metallicity is only 84% of what it was in the protostellar phase (before nuclear fusion in the core started). In the future, helium will continue to accumulate in the core, and in about 5 billion years this gradual build-up will eventually cause the Sun to exit the main sequence and become a red giant.[57] The chemical composition of the photosphere is normally considered representative of the composition of the primordial Solar System.[58] Typically, the solar heavy-element abundances described above are measured both by using spectroscopy of the Sun's photosphere and by measuring abundances in meteorites that have never been heated to melting temperatures. These meteorites are thought to retain the composition of the protostellar Sun and are thus not affected by the settling of heavy elements. The two methods generally agree well.[59] The core of the Sun extends from the center to about 20–25% of the solar radius.[60] It has a density of up to 150 g/cm3[61][62] (about 150 times the density of water) and a temperature of close to 15.7 million kelvin (K).[62] By contrast, the Sun's surface temperature is about 5800 K. Recent analysis of SOHO mission data favors the idea that the core is rotating faster than the radiative zone outside it.[60] Through most of the Sun's life, energy has been produced by nuclear fusion in the core region through the proton–proton chain; this process converts hydrogen into helium.[63] Currently, 0.8% of the energy generated in the Sun comes from another sequence of fusion reactions called the CNO cycle; the proportion coming from the CNO cycle is expected to increase as the Sun becomes older and more luminous.[64][65] The core is the only region of the Sun that produces an appreciable amount of thermal energy through fusion; 99% of the Sun's power is generated in the innermost 24% of its radius, and almost no fusion occurs beyond 30% of the radius. The rest of the Sun is heated by this energy as it is transferred outward through many successive layers, finally to the solar photosphere where it escapes into space through radiation (photons) or advection (massive particles).[66][67] The proton–proton chain occurs around 9.2×1037 times each second in the core, converting about 3.7×1038 protons into alpha particles (helium nuclei) every second (out of a total of ~8.9×1056 free protons in the Sun), or about 6.2×1011 kg/s. However, each proton (on average) takes around 9 billion years to fuse with another using the PP chain.[66] Fusing four free protons (hydrogen nuclei) into a single alpha particle (helium nucleus) releases around 0.7% of the fused mass as energy,[68] so the Sun releases energy at the mass–energy conversion rate of 4.26 billion kg/s (which requires 600 billion kg of hydrogen[69]), for 384.6 yottawatts (3.846×1026 W),[5] or 9.192×1010 megatons of TNT per second. The large power output of the Sun is mainly due to the huge size and density of its core (compared to Earth and objects on Earth), with only a fairly small amount of power being generated per cubic metre. Theoretical models of the Sun's interior indicate a maximum power density, or energy production, of approximately 276.5 watts per cubic metre at the center of the core,[70] which, according to Karl Kruszelnicki, is about the same power density inside a compost pile.[71] The fusion rate in the core is in a self-correcting equilibrium: a slightly higher rate of fusion would cause the core to heat up more and expand slightly against the weight of the outer layers, reducing the density and hence the fusion rate and correcting the perturbation; and a slightly lower rate would cause the core to cool and shrink slightly, increasing the density and increasing the fusion rate and again reverting it to its present rate.[72][73] The radiative zone is the thickest layer of the Sun, at 0.45 solar radii. From the core out to about 0.7 solar radii, thermal radiation is the primary means of energy transfer.[74] The temperature drops from approximately 7 million to 2 million kelvins with increasing distance from the core.[62] This temperature gradient is less than the value of the adiabatic lapse rate and hence cannot drive convection, which explains why the transfer of energy through this zone is by radiation instead of thermal convection.[62] Ions of hydrogen and helium emit photons, which travel only a brief distance before being reabsorbed by other ions.[74] The density drops a hundredfold (from 20,000 kg/m3 to 200 kg/m3) between 0.25 solar radii and 0.7 radii, the top of the radiative zone.[74] The radiative zone and the convective zone are separated by a transition layer, the tachocline. This is a region where the sharp regime change between the uniform rotation of the radiative zone and the differential rotation of the convection zone results in a large shear between the two—a condition where successive horizontal layers slide past one another.[75] Presently, it is hypothesized that a magnetic dynamo, or solar dynamo, within this layer generates the Sun's magnetic field.[62] The Sun's convection zone extends from 0.7 solar radii (500,000 km) to near the surface. In this layer, the solar plasma is not dense or hot enough to transfer the heat energy of the interior outward via radiation. Instead, the density of the plasma is low enough to allow convective currents to develop and move the Sun's energy outward towards its surface. Material heated at the tachocline picks up heat and expands, thereby reducing its density and allowing it to rise. As a result, an orderly motion of the mass develops into thermal cells that carry most of the heat outward to the Sun's photosphere above. Once the material diffusively and radiatively cools just beneath the photospheric surface, its density increases, and it sinks to the base of the convection zone, where it again picks up heat from the top of the radiative zone and the convective cycle continues. At the photosphere, the temperature has dropped 350-fold to 5,700 K (9,800 °F) and the density to only 0.2 g/m3 (about 1/10,000 the density of air at sea level, and 1 millionth that of the inner layer of the convective zone).[62] The thermal columns of the convection zone form an imprint on the surface of the Sun giving it a granular appearance called the solar granulation at the smallest scale and supergranulation at larger scales. Turbulent convection in this outer part of the solar interior sustains \"small-scale\" dynamo action over the near-surface volume of the Sun.[62] The Sun's thermal columns are Bénard cells and take the shape of roughly hexagonal prisms.[76] The visible surface of the Sun, the photosphere, is the layer below which the Sun becomes opaque to visible light.[77] Photons produced in this layer escape the Sun through the transparent solar atmosphere above it and become solar radiation, sunlight. The change in opacity is due to the decreasing amount of H− ions, which absorb visible light easily.[77] Conversely, the visible light perceived is produced as electrons react with hydrogen atoms to produce H− ions.[78][79] The photosphere is tens to hundreds of kilometers thick, and is slightly less opaque than air on Earth. Because the upper part of the photosphere is cooler than the lower part, an image of the Sun appears brighter in the center than on the edge or limb of the solar disk, in a phenomenon known as limb darkening.[77] The spectrum of sunlight has approximately the spectrum of a black-body radiating at 5,772 K (9,930 °F),[12] interspersed with atomic absorption lines from the tenuous layers above the photosphere. The photosphere has a particle density of ~1023 m−3 (about 0.37% of the particle number per volume of Earth's atmosphere at sea level). The photosphere is not fully ionized—the extent of ionization is about 3%, leaving almost all of the hydrogen in atomic form.[80] The Sun's atmosphere is composed of five layers: the photosphere, the chromosphere, the transition region, the corona, and the heliosphere. The coolest layer of the Sun is a temperature minimum region extending to about 500 km above the photosphere, and has a temperature of about 4,100 K.[77] This part of the Sun is cool enough to allow for the existence of simple molecules such as carbon monoxide and water.[81] The chromosphere, transition region, and corona are much hotter than the surface of the Sun.[77] The reason is not well understood, but evidence suggests that Alfvén waves may have enough energy to heat the corona.[82] Above the temperature minimum layer is a layer about 2,000 km thick, dominated by a spectrum of emission and absorption lines.[77] It is called the chromosphere from the Greek root chroma, meaning color, because the chromosphere is visible as a colored flash at the beginning and end of total solar eclipses.[74] The temperature of the chromosphere increases gradually with altitude, ranging up to around 20,000 K near the top.[77] In the upper part of the chromosphere helium becomes partially ionized.[83] Above the chromosphere, in a thin (about 200 km) transition region, the temperature rises rapidly from around 20,000 K in the upper chromosphere to coronal temperatures closer to 1,000,000 K.[84] The temperature increase is facilitated by the full ionization of helium in the transition region, which significantly reduces radiative cooling of the plasma.[83] The transition region does not occur at a well-defined altitude, but forms a kind of nimbus around chromospheric features such as spicules and filaments, and is in constant, chaotic motion.[74] The transition region is not easily visible from Earth's surface, but is readily observable from space by instruments sensitive to extreme ultraviolet.[85] The corona is the next layer of the Sun. The low corona, near the surface of the Sun, has a particle density around 1015 m−3 to 1016 m−3.[83][e] The average temperature of the corona and solar wind is about 1,000,000–2,000,000 K; however, in the hottest regions it is 8,000,000–20,000,000 K.[84] Although no complete theory yet exists to account for the temperature of the corona, at least some of its heat is known to be from magnetic reconnection.[84][86] The corona is the extended atmosphere of the Sun, which has a volume much larger than the volume enclosed by the Sun's photosphere. A flow of plasma outward from the Sun into interplanetary space is the solar wind.[86] The heliosphere, the tenuous outermost atmosphere of the Sun, is filled with solar wind plasma and is defined to begin at the distance where the flow of the solar wind becomes superalfvénic—that is, where the flow becomes faster than the speed of Alfvén waves,[87] at approximately 20 solar radii (0.1 AU). Turbulence and dynamic forces in the heliosphere cannot affect the shape of the solar corona within, because the information can only travel at the speed of Alfvén waves. The solar wind travels outward continuously through the heliosphere,[88][89] forming the solar magnetic field into a spiral shape,[86] until it impacts the heliopause more than 50 AU from the Sun. In December 2004, the Voyager 1 probe passed through a shock front that is thought to be part of the heliopause.[90] In late 2012, Voyager 1 recorded a marked increase in cosmic ray collisions and a sharp drop in lower energy particles from the solar wind, which suggested that the probe had passed through the heliopause and entered the interstellar medium,[91] and indeed did so on August 25, 2012, at approximately 122 astronomical units (18 Tm) from the Sun.[92] The heliosphere has a heliotail which stretches out behind it due to the Sun's peculiar motion through the galaxy.[93] On April 28, 2021, NASA's Parker Solar Probe encountered the specific magnetic and particle conditions at 18.8 solar radii that indicated that it penetrated the Alfvén surface, the boundary separating the corona from the solar wind, defined as where the coronal plasma's Alfvén speed and the large-scale solar wind speed are equal.[94][95] During the flyby, Parker Solar Probe passed into and out of the corona several times. This proved the predictions that the Alfvén critical surface is not shaped like a smooth ball, but has spikes and valleys that wrinkle its surface.[94] The Sun emits light across the visible spectrum, so its color is white, with a CIE color-space index near (0.3, 0.3), when viewed from space or when the Sun is high in the sky. The Solar radiance per wavelength peaks in the green portion of the spectrum when viewed from space.[96][97] When the Sun is very low in the sky, atmospheric scattering renders the Sun yellow, red, orange, or magenta, and in rare occasions even green or blue. Some cultures mentally picture the Sun as yellow and some even red; the cultural reasons for this are debated.[98] The Sun is classed as a G2 star,[66] meaning it is a G-type star, with 2 indicating its surface temperature is in the second range of the G class. The solar constant is the amount of power that the Sun deposits per unit area that is directly exposed to sunlight. The solar constant is equal to approximately 1,368 W/m2 (watts per square meter) at a distance of one astronomical unit (AU) from the Sun (that is, at or near Earth's orbit).[99] Sunlight on the surface of Earth is attenuated by Earth's atmosphere, so that less power arrives at the surface (closer to 1,000 W/m2) in clear conditions when the Sun is near the zenith.[100] Sunlight at the top of Earth's atmosphere is composed (by total energy) of about 50% infrared light, 40% visible light, and 10% ultraviolet light.[101] The atmosphere filters out over 70% of solar ultraviolet, especially at the shorter wavelengths.[102] Solar ultraviolet radiation ionizes Earth's dayside upper atmosphere, creating the electrically conducting ionosphere.[103] Ultraviolet light from the Sun has antiseptic properties and can be used to sanitize tools and water. This radiation causes sunburn, and has other biological effects such as the production of vitamin D and sun tanning. It is the main cause of skin cancer. Ultraviolet light is strongly attenuated by Earth's ozone layer, so that the amount of UV varies greatly with latitude and has been partially responsible for many biological adaptations, including variations in human skin color.[104] High-energy gamma ray photons initially released with fusion reactions in the core are almost immediately absorbed by the solar plasma of the radiative zone, usually after traveling only a few millimeters. Re-emission happens in a random direction and usually at slightly lower energy. With this sequence of emissions and absorptions, it takes a long time for radiation to reach the Sun's surface. Estimates of the photon travel time range between 10,000 and 170,000 years.[105] In contrast, it takes only 2.3 seconds for neutrinos, which account for about 2% of the total energy production of the Sun, to reach the surface. Because energy transport in the Sun is a process that involves photons in thermodynamic equilibrium with matter, the time scale of energy transport in the Sun is longer, on the order of 30,000,000 years. This is the time it would take the Sun to return to a stable state if the rate of energy generation in its core were suddenly changed.[106] Electron neutrinos are released by fusion reactions in the core, but, unlike photons, they rarely interact with matter, so almost all are able to escape the Sun immediately. However, measurements of the number of these neutrinos produced in the Sun are lower than theories predict by a factor of 3. In 2001, the discovery of neutrino oscillation resolved the discrepancy: the Sun emits the number of electron neutrinos predicted by the theory, but neutrino detectors were missing 2⁄3 of them because the neutrinos had changed flavor by the time they were detected.[107] The Sun has a stellar magnetic field that varies across its surface. Its polar field is 1–2 gauss (0.0001–0.0002 T), whereas the field is typically 3,000 gauss (0.3 T) in features on the Sun called sunspots and 10–100 gauss (0.001–0.01 T) in solar prominences.[5] The magnetic field varies in time and location. The quasi-periodic 11-year solar cycle is the most prominent variation in which the number and size of sunspots waxes and wanes.[108][109][110] The solar magnetic field extends well beyond the Sun itself. The electrically conducting solar wind plasma carries the Sun's magnetic field into space, forming what is called the interplanetary magnetic field.[86] In an approximation known as ideal magnetohydrodynamics, plasma particles only move along magnetic field lines. As a result, the outward-flowing solar wind stretches the interplanetary magnetic field outward, forcing it into a roughly radial structure. For a simple dipolar solar magnetic field, with opposite hemispherical polarities on either side of the solar magnetic equator, a thin current sheet is formed in the solar wind. At great distances, the rotation of the Sun twists the dipolar magnetic field and corresponding current sheet into an Archimedean spiral structure called the Parker spiral.[86] Sunspots are visible as dark patches on the Sun's photosphere and correspond to concentrations of magnetic field where convective transport of heat is inhibited from the solar interior to the surface. As a result, sunspots are slightly cooler than the surrounding photosphere, so they appear dark. At a typical solar minimum, few sunspots are visible, and occasionally none can be seen at all. Those that do appear are at high solar latitudes. As the solar cycle progresses toward its maximum, sunspots tend to form closer to the solar equator, a phenomenon known as Spörer's law. The largest sunspots can be tens of thousands of kilometers across.[111] An 11-year sunspot cycle is half of a 22-year Babcock–Leighton dynamo cycle, which corresponds to an oscillatory exchange of energy between toroidal and poloidal solar magnetic fields. At solar-cycle maximum, the external poloidal dipolar magnetic field is near its dynamo-cycle minimum strength; but an internal toroidal quadrupolar field, generated through differential rotation within the tachocline, is near its maximum strength. At this point in the dynamo cycle, buoyant upwelling within the convective zone forces emergence of the toroidal magnetic field through the photosphere, giving rise to pairs of sunspots, roughly aligned east–west and having footprints with opposite magnetic polarities. The magnetic polarity of sunspot pairs alternates every solar cycle, a phenomenon described by Hale's law.[112][113] During the solar cycle's declining phase, energy shifts from the internal toroidal magnetic field to the external poloidal field, and sunspots diminish in number and size. At solar-cycle minimum, the toroidal field is, correspondingly, at minimum strength, sunspots are relatively rare, and the poloidal field is at its maximum strength. With the rise of the next 11-year sunspot cycle, differential rotation shifts magnetic energy back from the poloidal to the toroidal field, but with a polarity that is opposite to the previous cycle. The process carries on continuously, and in an idealized, simplified scenario, each 11-year sunspot cycle corresponds to a change, then, in the overall polarity of the Sun's large-scale magnetic field.[114][115] The Sun's magnetic field leads to many effects that are collectively called solar activity. Solar flares and coronal mass ejections tend to occur at sunspot groups. Slowly changing high-speed streams of solar wind are emitted from coronal holes at the photospheric surface. Both coronal mass ejections and high-speed streams of solar wind carry plasma and the interplanetary magnetic field outward into the Solar System.[116] The effects of solar activity on Earth include auroras at moderate to high latitudes and the disruption of radio communications and electric power. Solar activity is thought to have played a large role in the formation and evolution of the Solar System.[117] Change in solar irradiance over the 11 year solar cycle has been correlated with change in sunspot number.[118] The solar cycle influences space weather conditions, including those surrounding Earth. For example, in the 17th century, the solar cycle appeared to have stopped entirely for several decades; few sunspots were observed during a period known as the Maunder minimum. This coincided in time with the era of the Little Ice Age, when Europe experienced unusually cold temperatures.[119] [120] Earlier extended minima have been discovered through analysis of tree rings and appear to have coincided with lower-than-average global temperatures.[121] The temperature of the photosphere is approximately 6,000 K, whereas the temperature of the corona reaches 1,000,000–2,000,000 K.[84] The high temperature of the corona shows that it is heated by something other than direct heat conduction from the photosphere.[86] It is thought that the energy necessary to heat the corona is provided by turbulent motion in the convection zone below the photosphere, and two main mechanisms have been proposed to explain coronal heating.[84] The first is wave heating, in which sound, gravitational or magnetohydrodynamic waves are produced by turbulence in the convection zone.[84] These waves travel upward and dissipate in the corona, depositing their energy in the ambient matter in the form of heat.[122] The other is magnetic heating, in which magnetic energy is continuously built up by photospheric motion and released through magnetic reconnection in the form of large solar flares and myriad similar but smaller events—nanoflares.[123] Currently, it is unclear whether waves are an efficient heating mechanism. All waves except Alfvén waves have been found to dissipate or refract before reaching the corona.[124] In addition, Alfvén waves do not easily dissipate in the corona. Current research focus has therefore shifted towards flare heating mechanisms.[84] The Sun today is roughly halfway through the main-sequence portion of its life. It has not changed dramatically in over four billion[a] years and will remain fairly stable for about five billion more. However, after hydrogen fusion in its core has stopped, the Sun will undergo dramatic changes, both internally and externally. The Sun formed about 4.6 billion years ago from the collapse of part of a giant molecular cloud that consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium and that probably gave birth to many other stars.[125] This age is estimated using computer models of stellar evolution and through nucleocosmochronology.[13] The result is consistent with the radiometric date of the oldest Solar System material, at 4.567 billion years ago.[126][127] Studies of ancient meteorites reveal traces of stable daughter nuclei of short-lived isotopes, such as iron-60, that form only in exploding, short-lived stars. This indicates that one or more supernovae must have occurred near the location where the Sun formed. A shock wave from a nearby supernova would have triggered the formation of the Sun by compressing the matter within the molecular cloud and causing certain regions to collapse under their own gravity.[128] As one fragment of the cloud collapsed it also began to rotate due to conservation of angular momentum and heat up with the increasing pressure.[129] Much of the mass became concentrated in the center, whereas the rest flattened out into a disk that would become the planets and other Solar System bodies.[130][131] Gravity and pressure within the core of the cloud generated a lot of heat as it accumulated more matter from the surrounding disk, eventually triggering nuclear fusion.[132] The stars HD 162826 and HD 186302 share similarities with the Sun and are thus hypothesized to be its stellar siblings, formed in the same molecular cloud.[133][134] The Sun is about halfway through its main-sequence stage, during which nuclear fusion reactions in its core fuse hydrogen into helium. Each second, more than four billion kilograms of matter are converted into energy within the Sun's core, producing neutrinos and solar radiation. At this rate, the Sun has so far converted around 100 times the mass of Earth into energy, about 0.03% of the total mass of the Sun. The Sun will spend a total of approximately 10 to 11 billion years as a main-sequence star before the red giant phase of the Sun.[135] At the 8 billion year mark, the Sun will be at its hottest point according to the ESA's Gaia space observatory mission in 2022.[136] The Sun is gradually becoming hotter in its core, hotter at the surface, larger in radius, and more luminous during its time on the main sequence: since the beginning of its main sequence life, it has expanded in radius by 15% and the surface has increased in temperature from 5,620 K (9,660 °F) to 5,772 K (9,930 °F), resulting in a 48% increase in luminosity from 0.677 solar luminosities to its present-day 1.0 solar luminosity. This occurs because the helium atoms in the core have a higher mean molecular weight than the hydrogen atoms that were fused, resulting in less thermal pressure. The core is therefore shrinking, allowing the outer layers of the Sun to move closer to the center, releasing gravitational potential energy. According to the virial theorem, half of this released gravitational energy goes into heating, which leads to a gradual increase in the rate at which fusion occurs and thus an increase in the luminosity. This process speeds up as the core gradually becomes denser.[137] At present, it is increasing in brightness by about 1% every 100 million years. It will take at least 1 billion years from now to deplete liquid water from the Earth from such increase.[138] After that, the Earth will cease to be able to support complex, multicellular life and the last remaining multicellular organisms on the planet will suffer a final, complete mass extinction.[139] The Sun does not have enough mass to explode as a supernova. Instead, when it runs out of hydrogen in the core in approximately 5 billion years, core hydrogen fusion will stop, and there will be nothing to prevent the core from contracting. The release of gravitational potential energy will cause the luminosity of the Sun to increase, ending the main sequence phase and leading the Sun to expand over the next billion years: first into a subgiant, and then into a red giant.[137][140][141] The heating due to gravitational contraction will also lead to expansion of the Sun and hydrogen fusion in a shell just outside the core, where unfused hydrogen remains, contributing to the increased luminosity, which will eventually reach more than 1,000 times its present luminosity.[137] When the Sun enters its red-giant branch (RGB) phase, it will engulf (and very likely destroy) Mercury and Venus. According to a 2008 article, Earth's orbit will have initially expanded to at most 1.5 AU (220 million km; 140 million mi) due to the Sun's loss of mass. However, Earth's orbit will then start shrinking due to tidal forces (and, eventually, drag from the lower chromosphere) so that it is engulfed by the Sun during the tip of the red-giant branch phase 7.59 billion years from now, 3.8 and 1 million years after Mercury and Venus have respectively suffered the same fate.[141] By the time the Sun reaches the tip of the red-giant branch, it will be about 256 times larger than it is today, with a radius of 1.19 AU (178 million km; 111 million mi).[141][142] The Sun will spend around a billion years in the RGB and lose around a third of its mass.[141] After the red-giant branch, the Sun has approximately 120 million years of active life left, but much happens. First, the core (full of degenerate helium) ignites violently in the helium flash; it is estimated that 6% of the core—itself 40% of the Sun's mass—will be converted into carbon within a matter of minutes through the triple-alpha process.[143] The Sun then shrinks to around 10 times its current size and 50 times the luminosity, with a temperature a little lower than today. It will then have reached the red clump or horizontal branch, but a star of the Sun's metallicity does not evolve blueward along the horizontal branch. Instead, it just becomes moderately larger and more luminous over about 100 million years as it continues to react helium in the core.[141] When the helium is exhausted, the Sun will repeat the expansion it followed when the hydrogen in the core was exhausted. This time, however, it all happens faster, and the Sun becomes larger and more luminous. This is the asymptotic-giant-branch phase, and the Sun is alternately reacting hydrogen in a shell or helium in a deeper shell. After about 20 million years on the early asymptotic giant branch, the Sun becomes increasingly unstable, with rapid mass loss and thermal pulses that increase the size and luminosity for a few hundred years every 100,000 years or so. The thermal pulses become larger each time, with the later pulses pushing the luminosity to as much as 5,000 times the current level. Despite this, the Sun's maximum AGB radius will not be as large as its tip-RGB maximum: 179 R☉, or about 0.832 AU (124.5 million km; 77.3 million mi).[141][144] Models vary depending on the rate and timing of mass loss. Models that have higher mass loss on the red-giant branch produce smaller, less luminous stars at the tip of the asymptotic giant branch, perhaps only 2,000 times the luminosity and less than 200 times the radius.[141] For the Sun, four thermal pulses are predicted before it completely loses its outer envelope and starts to make a planetary nebula.[145] The post-asymptotic-giant-branch evolution is even faster. The luminosity stays approximately constant as the temperature increases, with the ejected half of the Sun's mass becoming ionized into a planetary nebula as the exposed core reaches 30,000 K (53,500 °F), as if it is in a sort of blue loop. The final naked core, a white dwarf, will have a temperature of over 100,000 K (180,000 °F) and contain an estimated 54.05% of the Sun's present-day mass.[141] Simulations indicate that the Sun may be among the least massive stars capable of forming a planetary nebula.[146] The planetary nebula will disperse in about 10,000 years, but the white dwarf will survive for trillions of years before fading to a hypothetical super-dense black dwarf.[147][148][149] As such, it would give off no more energy.[150] The Sun has eight known planets orbiting it. This includes four terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars), two gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn), and two ice giants (Uranus and Neptune). The Solar System also has nine bodies generally considered as dwarf planets and some more candidates, an asteroid belt, numerous comets, and a large number of icy bodies which lie beyond the orbit of Neptune. Six of the planets and many smaller bodies also have their own natural satellites: in particular, the satellite systems of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus are in some ways like miniature versions of the Sun's system.[151] The Sun is moved by the gravitational pull of the planets. The center of the Sun moves around the Solar System barycenter, within a range from 0.1 to 2.2 solar radii. The Sun's motion around the barycenter approximately repeats every 179 years, rotated by about 30° due primarily to the synodic period of Jupiter and Saturn.[152] The Sun's gravitational field is estimated to dominate the gravitational forces of surrounding stars out to about two light-years (125,000 AU). Lower estimates for the radius of the Oort cloud, by contrast, do not place it farther than 50,000 AU.[153] Most of the mass is orbiting in the region between 3,000 and 100,000 AU.[154] The furthest known objects, such as Comet West, have aphelia around 70,000 AU from the Sun.[155] The Sun's Hill sphere with respect to the galactic nucleus, the effective range of its gravitational influence, was calculated by G. A. Chebotarev to be 230,000 AU.[156] Within 10 light-years of the Sun there are relatively few stars, the closest being the triple star system Alpha Centauri, which is about 4.4 light-years away and may be in the Local Bubble's G-Cloud.[158] Alpha Centauri A and B are a closely tied pair of Sun-like stars, whereas the closest star to the Sun, the small red dwarf Proxima Centauri, orbits the pair at a distance of 0.2 light-years. In 2016, a potentially habitable exoplanet was found to be orbiting Proxima Centauri, called Proxima Centauri b, the closest confirmed exoplanet to the Sun.[159] The Solar System is surrounded by the Local Interstellar Cloud, although it is not clear if it is embedded in the Local Interstellar Cloud or if it lies just outside the cloud's edge.[160] Multiple other interstellar clouds exist in the region within 300 light-years of the Sun, known as the Local Bubble.[160] The latter feature is an hourglass-shaped cavity or superbubble in the interstellar medium roughly 300 light-years across. The bubble is suffused with high-temperature plasma, suggesting that it may be the product of several recent supernovae.[161] The Local Bubble is a small superbubble compared to the neighboring wider Radcliffe Wave and Split linear structures (formerly Gould Belt), each of which are some thousands of light-years in length.[162] All these structures are part of the Orion Arm, which contains most of the stars in the Milky Way that are visible to the unaided eye.[163] Groups of stars form together in star clusters, before dissolving into co-moving associations. A prominent grouping that is visible to the naked eye is the Ursa Major moving group, which is around 80 light-years away within the Local Bubble. The nearest star cluster is Hyades, which lies at the edge of the Local Bubble. The closest star-forming regions are the Corona Australis Molecular Cloud, the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex and the Taurus molecular cloud; the latter lies just beyond the Local Bubble and is part of the Radcliffe wave.[164] The Sun, taking along the whole Solar System, orbits the galaxy's center of mass at an average speed of 230 km/s (828,000 km/h) or 143 mi/s (514,000 mph),[167] taking about 220–250 million Earth years to complete a revolution (a Galactic year),[168] having done so about 20 times since the Sun's formation.[169][170] The direction of the Sun's motion, the Solar apex, is roughly in the direction of the star Vega.[171] The Milky Way is moving with respect to the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) in the direction of the constellation Hydra with a speed of 550 km/s. Since the Sun is moving with respect to the galactic center in the direction of Cygnus (galactic longitude 90°; latitude 0°) at more than 200 km/sec, the resultant velocity with respect to the CMB is about 370 km/s in the direction of Crater or Leo (galactic latitude 264°, latitude 48°).[172] In many prehistoric and ancient cultures, the Sun was thought to be a solar deity or other supernatural entity.[173][174] In the early first millennium BC, Babylonian astronomers observed that the Sun's motion along the ecliptic is not uniform, though they did not know why; it is today known that this is due to the movement of Earth in an elliptic orbit, moving faster when it is nearer to the Sun at perihelion and moving slower when it is farther away at aphelion.[175] One of the first people to offer a scientific or philosophical explanation for the Sun was the Greek philosopher Anaxagoras. He reasoned that it was a giant flaming ball of metal even larger than the land of the Peloponnesus and that the Moon reflected the light of the Sun.[176] Eratosthenes estimated the distance between Earth and the Sun in the third century BC as \"of stadia myriads 400 and 80000\", the translation of which is ambiguous, implying either 4,080,000 stadia (755,000 km) or 804,000,000 stadia (148 to 153 million kilometers or 0.99 to 1.02 AU); the latter value is correct to within a few percent. In the first century AD, Ptolemy estimated the distance as 1,210 times the radius of Earth, approximately 7.71 million kilometers (0.0515 AU).[177] The theory that the Sun is the center around which the planets orbit was first proposed by the ancient Greek Aristarchus of Samos in the third century BC,[178] and later adopted by Seleucus of Seleucia (see Heliocentrism).[179] This view was developed in a more detailed mathematical model of a heliocentric system in the 16th century by Nicolaus Copernicus.[180] Observations of sunspots were recorded during the Han dynasty (206 BC–AD 220) by Chinese astronomers, who maintained records of these observations for centuries. Averroes also provided a description of sunspots in the 12th century.[181] The invention of the telescope in the early 17th century permitted detailed observations of sunspots by Thomas Harriot, Galileo Galilei and other astronomers. Galileo posited that sunspots were on the surface of the Sun rather than small objects passing between Earth and the Sun.[182] Arabic astronomical contributions include Al-Battani's discovery that the direction of the Sun's apogee (the place in the Sun's orbit against the fixed stars where it seems to be moving slowest) is changing.[183] In modern heliocentric terms, this is caused by a gradual motion of the aphelion of the Earth's orbit. Ibn Yunus observed more than 10,000 entries for the Sun's position for many years using a large astrolabe.[184] From an observation of a transit of Venus in 1032, the Persian astronomer and polymath Ibn Sina concluded that Venus was closer to Earth than the Sun.[185] In 1677, Edmond Halley observed a transit of Mercury across the Sun, leading him to realize that observations of the solar parallax of a planet (more ideally using the transit of Venus) could be used to trigonometrically determine the distances between Earth, Venus, and the Sun.[186] Careful observations of the 1769 transit of Venus allowed astronomers to calculate the average Earth–Sun distance as 93,726,900 miles (150,838,800 km), only 0.8% greater than the modern value.[187] In 1666, Isaac Newton observed the Sun's light using a prism, and showed that it is made up of light of many colors.[188] In 1800, William Herschel discovered infrared radiation beyond the red part of the solar spectrum.[189] The 19th century saw advancement in spectroscopic studies of the Sun; Joseph von Fraunhofer recorded more than 600 absorption lines in the spectrum, the strongest of which are still often referred to as Fraunhofer lines. The 20th century brought about several specialized systems for observing the Sun, especially at different narrowband wavelengths, such as those using Calcium H (396.9 nm), K (393.37 nm) and Hydrogen-alpha (656.46 nm) filtering.[190] During early studies of the optical spectrum of the photosphere, some absorption lines were found that did not correspond to any chemical elements then known on Earth. In 1868, Norman Lockyer hypothesized that these absorption lines were caused by a new element that he dubbed helium, after the Greek Sun god Helios. Twenty-five years later, helium was isolated on Earth.[191] In the early years of the modern scientific era, the source of the Sun's energy was a significant puzzle. Lord Kelvin suggested that the Sun is a gradually cooling liquid body that is radiating an internal store of heat.[192] Kelvin and Hermann von Helmholtz then proposed a gravitational contraction mechanism to explain the energy output, but the resulting age estimate was only 20 million years, well short of the time span of at least 300 million years suggested by some geological discoveries of that time.[192][193] In 1890, Lockyer proposed a meteoritic hypothesis for the formation and evolution of the Sun.[194] Not until 1904 was a documented solution offered. Ernest Rutherford suggested that the Sun's output could be maintained by an internal source of heat, and suggested radioactive decay as the source.[195] However, it would be Albert Einstein who would provide the essential clue to the source of the Sun's energy output with his mass–energy equivalence relation E = mc2.[196] In 1920, Sir Arthur Eddington proposed that the pressures and temperatures at the core of the Sun could produce a nuclear fusion reaction that merged hydrogen (protons) into helium nuclei, resulting in a production of energy from the net change in mass.[197] The preponderance of hydrogen in the Sun was confirmed in 1925 by Cecilia Payne using the ionization theory developed by Meghnad Saha. The theoretical concept of fusion was developed in the 1930s by the astrophysicists Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar and Hans Bethe. Hans Bethe calculated the details of the two main energy-producing nuclear reactions that power the Sun.[198][199] In 1957, Margaret Burbidge, Geoffrey Burbidge, William Fowler and Fred Hoyle showed that most of the elements in the universe have been synthesized by nuclear reactions inside stars, some like the Sun.[200] The first satellites designed for long term observation of the Sun from interplanetary space were NASA's Pioneers 6, 7, 8 and 9, which were launched between 1959 and 1968. These probes orbited the Sun at a distance similar to that of Earth, and made the first detailed measurements of the solar wind and the solar magnetic field. Pioneer 9 operated for a particularly long time, transmitting data until May 1983.[201][202] In the 1970s, two Helios spacecraft and the Skylab Apollo Telescope Mount provided scientists with significant new data on solar wind and the solar corona. The Helios 1 and 2 probes were U.S.–German collaborations that studied the solar wind from an orbit carrying the spacecraft inside Mercury's orbit at perihelion.[203] The Skylab space station, launched by NASA in 1973, included a solar observatory module called the Apollo Telescope Mount that was operated by astronauts resident on the station.[85] Skylab made the first time-resolved observations of the solar transition region and of ultraviolet emissions from the solar corona.[85] Discoveries included the first observations of coronal mass ejections, then called \"coronal transients\", and of coronal holes, now known to be intimately associated with the solar wind.[203] In 1980, the Solar Maximum Mission probes were launched by NASA. This spacecraft was designed to observe gamma rays, X-rays and UV radiation from solar flares during a time of high solar activity and solar luminosity. Just a few months after launch, however, an electronics failure caused the probe to go into standby mode, and it spent the next three years in this inactive state. In 1984, Space Shuttle Challenger mission STS-41C retrieved the satellite and repaired its electronics before re-releasing it into orbit. The Solar Maximum Mission subsequently acquired thousands of images of the solar corona before re-entering Earth's atmosphere in June 1989.[204] Launched in 1991, Japan's Yohkoh (Sunbeam) satellite observed solar flares at X-ray wavelengths. Mission data allowed scientists to identify several different types of flares and demonstrated that the corona away from regions of peak activity was much more dynamic and active than had previously been supposed. Yohkoh observed an entire solar cycle but went into standby mode when an annular eclipse in 2001 caused it to lose its lock on the Sun. It was destroyed by atmospheric re-entry in 2005.[205] The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, jointly built by the European Space Agency and NASA, was launched on 2 December 1995.[85] Originally intended to serve a two-year mission,[206] SOHO remains in operation as of 2024.[207] Situated at the Lagrangian point between Earth and the Sun (at which the gravitational pull from both is equal), SOHO has provided a constant view of the Sun at many wavelengths since its launch.[85] Besides its direct solar observation, SOHO has enabled the discovery of a large number of comets, mostly tiny sungrazing comets that incinerate as they pass the Sun.[208] All these satellites have observed the Sun from the plane of the ecliptic, and so have only observed its equatorial regions in detail. The Ulysses probe was launched in 1990 to study the Sun's polar regions. It first traveled to Jupiter, to \"slingshot\" into an orbit that would take it far above the plane of the ecliptic. Once Ulysses was in its scheduled orbit, it began observing the solar wind and magnetic field strength at high solar latitudes, finding that the solar wind from high latitudes was moving at about 750 km/s, which was slower than expected, and that there were large magnetic waves emerging from high latitudes that scattered galactic cosmic rays.[209] Elemental abundances in the photosphere are well known from spectroscopic studies, but the composition of the interior of the Sun is more poorly understood. A solar wind sample return mission, Genesis, was designed to allow astronomers to directly measure the composition of solar material.[210] The brightness of the Sun can cause pain from looking at it with the naked eye; however, doing so for brief periods is not hazardous for normal non-dilated eyes.[211][212] Looking directly at the Sun (sungazing) causes phosphene visual artifacts and temporary partial blindness. It also delivers about 4 milliwatts of sunlight to the retina, slightly heating it and potentially causing damage in eyes that cannot respond properly to the brightness.[213][214] Viewing of the direct Sun with the naked eye can cause UV-induced, sunburn-like lesions on the retina beginning after about 100 seconds, particularly under conditions where the UV light from the Sun is intense and well focused.[215][216] Viewing the Sun through light-concentrating optics such as binoculars may result in permanent damage to the retina without an appropriate filter that blocks UV and substantially dims the sunlight. When using an attenuating filter to view the Sun, the viewer is cautioned to use a filter specifically designed for that use. Some improvised filters that pass UV or IR rays, can actually harm the eye at high brightness levels.[217] Brief glances at the midday Sun through an unfiltered telescope can cause permanent damage.[218] During sunrise and sunset, sunlight is attenuated because of Rayleigh scattering and Mie scattering from a particularly long passage through Earth's atmosphere,[219] and the Sun is sometimes faint enough to be viewed comfortably with the naked eye or safely with optics (provided there is no risk of bright sunlight suddenly appearing through a break between clouds). Hazy conditions, atmospheric dust, and high humidity contribute to this atmospheric attenuation.[220] An optical phenomenon, known as a green flash, can sometimes be seen shortly after sunset or before sunrise. The flash is caused by light from the Sun just below the horizon being bent (usually through a temperature inversion) towards the observer. Light of shorter wavelengths (violet, blue, green) is bent more than that of longer wavelengths (yellow, orange, red) but the violet and blue light is scattered more, leaving light that is perceived as green.[221] Solar deities play a major role in many world religions and mythologies.[222] Worship of the Sun was central to civilizations such as the ancient Egyptians, the Inca of South America and the Aztecs of what is now Mexico. In religions such as Hinduism, the Sun is still considered a god, known as Surya. Many ancient monuments were constructed with solar phenomena in mind; for example, stone megaliths accurately mark the summer or winter solstice (for example in Nabta Playa, Egypt; Mnajdra, Malta; and Stonehenge, England); Newgrange, a prehistoric human-built mount in Ireland, was designed to detect the winter solstice; the pyramid of El Castillo at Chichén Itzá in Mexico is designed to cast shadows in the shape of serpents climbing the pyramid at the vernal and autumnal equinoxes.[223] The ancient Sumerians believed that the Sun was Utu,[224][225] the god of justice and twin brother of Inanna, the Queen of Heaven,[224] who was identified as the planet Venus.[225] Later, Utu was identified with the East Semitic god Shamash.[224][225] Utu was regarded as a helper-deity, who aided those in distress.[224] From at least the Fourth Dynasty of Ancient Egypt, the Sun was worshipped as the god Ra, portrayed as a falcon-headed divinity surmounted by the solar disk, and surrounded by a serpent. In the New Empire period, the Sun became identified with the dung beetle. In the form of the sun disc Aten, the Sun had a brief resurgence during the Amarna Period when it again became the preeminent, if not only, divinity for the Pharaoh Akhenaton.[226][227] The Egyptians portrayed the god Ra as being carried across the sky in a solar barque, accompanied by lesser gods, and to the Greeks, he was Helios, carried by a chariot drawn by fiery horses. From the reign of Elagabalus in the late Roman Empire the Sun's birthday was a holiday celebrated as Sol Invictus (literally \"Unconquered Sun\") soon after the winter solstice, which may have been an antecedent to Christmas. Regarding the fixed stars, the Sun appears from Earth to revolve once a year along the ecliptic through the zodiac, and so Greek astronomers categorized it as one of the seven planets (Greek planetes, \"wanderer\"); the naming of the days of the weeks after the seven planets dates to the Roman era.[228][229][230] In Proto-Indo-European religion, the Sun was personified as the goddess *Seh2ul.[231][232] Derivatives of this goddess in Indo-European languages include the Old Norse Sól, Sanskrit Surya, Gaulish Sulis, Lithuanian Saulė, and Slavic Solntse.[232] In ancient Greek religion, the sun deity was the male god Helios,[233] who in later times was syncretized with Apollo.[234] In the Bible, Malachi 4:2 mentions the \"Sun of Righteousness\" (sometimes translated as the \"Sun of Justice\"),[235][236] which some Christians have interpreted as a reference to the Messiah (Christ).[237] In ancient Roman culture, Sunday was the day of the sun god. In paganism, the Sun was a source of life, giving warmth and illumination. It was the center of a popular cult among Romans, who would stand at dawn to catch the first rays of sunshine as they prayed. The celebration of the winter solstice (which influenced Christmas) was part of the Roman cult of the unconquered Sun (Sol Invictus). It was adopted as the Sabbath day by Christians. The symbol of light was a pagan device adopted by Christians, and perhaps the most important one that did not come from Jewish traditions. Christian churches were built so that the congregation faced toward the sunrise.[238] Tonatiuh, the Aztec god of the sun,[239] was closely associated with the practice of human sacrifice.[239] The sun goddess Amaterasu is the most important deity in the Shinto religion,[240][241] and she is believed to be the direct ancestor of all Japanese emperors.[240] Solar System → Local Interstellar Cloud → Local Bubble → Gould Belt → Orion Arm → Milky Way → Milky Way subgroup → Local Group → Local Sheet → Virgo Supercluster → Laniakea Supercluster → Local Hole → Observable universe → UniverseEach arrow (→) may be read as \"within\" or \"part of\".",

                "content": "When Mitch Jeter went out with injury earlier this season, Notre Dame was statistically the worst field goal kicking team in the nation. Let's just say the Irish will be kissing their clovers they have their kicker back. He drilled the 41 yarder to call game and send Notre Dame back to the National Championship. They will be looking to return the title back to South Bend for the first time since 1988, but before they set their sights either Texas or Ohio State, they will celebrate this Orange Bowl win. Penn States defense made a stop and gave Drew Allar and the offense a chance to win it late in the fourth quarter, but the Jr. QB who has thrown 53 touchdown and just 9 INTs in his career made the worst mistake you could possibly make in this situation and the rest is history. Allar went 12/23 for 135 yards, but his last throw was the biggest one of the game as Christian Gray set up ND in perfect position to win it. As always their fearless leader, Riley Leonard, rallied his guys and tied the game up with this 54 yard pass to Jaden Greathouse to took it all the way into the end zone and tied the game with under five minutes to go. Leonard ended the game with 223 yards 1 TD and 2 INTs on 15/23 passing, but he made the big plays when he needed to, and they needed this bomb to Greathouse to level things up late in the game. Allar was picked off in the end zone just a few played after the Leonard interception, but a pass interference penalty against the Irish gave Penn State a first down inside the 10 yard line and Singleton completed his hat trick of touchdowns as the Nittany Lions retook the lead. On the next play from scrimmage following Singleton's second TD run, Riley Leonard was picked off by Dani Dennis-Sutton and momentum completely shifted for Penn State who had a short field to work with after forcing the turnover. Losing the lead seemed to ignite the Nittany Lions as Drew Allar had a couple of long pass plays to set up this Singleton touchdown to set up a do or die last 10 minutes from Miami. ND seemingly had all the momentum ending the first half and starting the second. They scored 17 unanswered points to take the lead with this tough Jeremiyah Love TD run early in the fourth quarter. The Irish would finish the game with 115 yards rushing, and Love led the way with 45 yards on 11 carries. Notre Dame saw their starting QB and leader Riley Leonard take a big hit and get knocked out of the game for a drive and Steve Angeli came in and lead the team down the field and set up a field goal to get ND on the board. Coming out of the break, the Irish started to use the ground game, after having just 15 yards rushing in the first half. They ran it for 44 yards on this drive alone and that seemed to open up the passing game for the rest of the way. Leonard came back in the game after half and he tied the game up with a TD run to start the third quarter. The Nittany Lions offense went to the hurry up after taking the field goal lead and marched down the field on the shoulders of Nick Singleton who punched in his first of three TDs. The Notre Dame Fighting Irish are heading to the College Football Playoff National Championship after a dramatic ending from Miami as they took down the Penn State Nittany Lions in the Orange Bowl. Mitch Jeter kicked the winning field goal in a 27-24 game that went down to the wire. We didn't expect many fireworks between these two teams but that's exactly what we got. It took a little while for the offense to kick in, and what ignited it was a defensive play made by Penn State. That led to a Nittany Lion field goal after getting down to the one yard line but getting stopped on a goal to go situation. We'll get to the rest of the highlights in a second. But first, Mitch Jeter with the biggest kick of his life, and he drills it. Penn State made a big stop and had a chance to take the lead, but Allar's pass was picked by Christian Gray and that set up the Fighting Irish with a chance to win it in the last minute. Penn State tried the lateral play but the crossfield pass sails out of bounds and Notre Dame is heading to the National Championship!!!

As always the pre kickoff festivities are taking a little longer than usual, but it's coin flip time and the Fighting Irish win the toss and they differ to the second half. Penn State will start the CFP Semifinal with the ball. It all comes down to next Monday. The winner of tonight’s game and the winner of tomorrow’s Cotton Bowl will meet at Mercedes Benz Stadium for a chance at the CFP Nation Championship. The last time this game was played here in Atlanta was back in 2018 when the Alabama Crimson Tide beat the Georgia Bulldogs. Notre Dame has 11 titles, Penn State has two, Texas has four and Ohio State has eight. These are teams with massive championship pedigrees. Remember, this is just one of two CFP semifinals this week. After Notre Dame and Penn State duke it out tonight in Miami, the Texas Longhorns and the Ohio State Buckeyes will play tomorrow in the Cotton Bowl from Dallas. That will lead us into a two game NFL playoff slate on Saturday featuring the Chargers vs. Texans and Steeles vs. Ravens. Sunday we have the Broncos vs. Bills, Packers vs. Eagles and Commanders vs. Buccaneers. We will finish the football frenzy with a Monday Night match up between the Vikings and the Rams and remember you can follow all the action right here on AS English. This is the first time we have seen the 12 team playoff, and there is a lot to digest after the first few weeks. It’s tough for the NCAA to get everything right on the first attempt, and heading into the semifinals we see no teams that had a first round bye still alive in the CFP. The teams that were supposed to be favorites and have the advantage of getting the BYE week, looked rusty and were eventually knocked out. This will be Notre Dame and Penn State’s third game since the end of their “season” and it seems like these teams are back in midseason form after basically starting a new season three weeks ago. These playoffs have shown us rust is winning in the rust vs. rest debate. Penn State have one of the best one-two punches in the league with Kaytron Allen and Nicholas Singleton in their backfield. Both RBs have run for 1,000+ yards, with Allen rising for 10 yards more (1,026) but he has almost 50 carries more than Allen. Singleton is more of a dual threat back, having caught 39 passes fo 342 yards and five TDs through the air. Together they have 17 TDs on the ground and another 7 TDs receiving. This is a team that’ has a nice balance of their run and pass game, but over the last two games their defense has stepped up and allowed just 24 points in two games. There has been a lot of talk about Riley Leonard and his ability to lead his team and his will to win. The senior QB wasn’t up for any end of season awards for his quarterbacking play, but he is a winner. He threw for just 2,383 yards, 18 TDs and 6 INTs this season, but he is equally or even more dangerous with his feet. He’s got 831 yards rushing on the season and scored another 15 TDs with his feet, but the question is can he lead this offense tonight if Penn State stops the run and he has to pass the ball? He had just 90 yards passing against Georgia last week, but did throw a TD pass right before the half to swing the momentum in favor of ND, and ran for 80 yards. If the Irish are going to win, it’s going to come down to how their QB plays. The question coming into this game, and really all of head coach James Franklin’s time in South Bend is can he win the big one? After coming into the season ranked in the Top 10 in the nation, they won their first seven games but only one of them was against a ranked team, and that was No. 19 Illinois. They lost their first game to 4th ranked Ohio State 20-13 at the beginning of November, but then they won four straight to set up a meeting with the Oregon Ducks in the Big 10 Championship. They lost that game by a TD, and again the questions around Franklin started to surface. Wins over SMU and Boise State have given their coach a little leeway but now come the big big games. Notre Dame came into the season ranked in the top 10 in the preseason polls, but suffered a heartbreaking defeat to the Norther Illinois Huskies in their second game of the season after Mitch Jeter had his 62 yard game-winning field goal blocked as time ran out. Since then the Fighting Irish have been perfect. They have won 12 straight including but the question remains? Who have the Fighting Irish beat this year? They beat three ranked teams in the regular season none higher than 15th and beat an over achieving Indiana team in the first round of the playoffs before beating a Georgia team with a back up who had only thrown a handful of passes in his college career before last week’s game. After taking down SMU in the opening game of their playoff schedule, the Penn State Nittany Lions met Ashton Jenty and the Boise State Broncos. They contained the leading rusher in the country to just 104 yards on 30 carries, meanwhile Drew Allar threw two of his three TDs in the first quarter to take a 14-0 lead. Kaytron Allen and 134 yards on a day that Penn State ran for over 200 total yards and Nicholas Singleton capped the game with a 58 yard TD run to take a 31-14 lead with under 5:00 to go in the fourth quarter to set State up with a massive match up against Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl from Miami. After winning the battle for Indiana in a frigid South Bend to open their College Football Playoff slate, the fighting Irish met the Georgia Bulldogs who had won two of the last three CFP National Championships. With the Bulldogs’ starting QB Carson Beck out with injury they went to their back up Gunner Stockton and the Fighting Irish defense shut him down for most of the game. It was a low scoring first half until the final minute of the second quarter. Mitch Jeter kicked a field goal to put ND up 6-3, on the next play from scrimmage, Stockton was strip sacked by RJ Oben which led to a 13 yard TD pass from Riley Leonard to Beaux Collins to end the first half. The Fighting Irish got the ball to start the second half and Jayden Harrison took the kick off 98 yards for a TD and the Irish went from a 3-3 game with 43 seconds left in the first half to leading 20-3 fifteen seconds into the third quarter. They would hold off the Bulldogs and win 23-10 to reach the CFP semifinal tonight against Penn State. Hello everyone and welcome to Miami where two legendary teams are back fighting for the top prize in college football after years trying to keep up with the top dogs in the game. They have advanced through the first two games of the expanded college football playoff and now they are just a game away from the National Championship. Notre Dame has only lost one game all season and that was back in early September. If they want to get to the big game, they will have to extend either win streak tonight against a Penn State team that has dominated both of their playoff games after losing their Big Ten Championship to Oregon to end the regular season. The stage it set. Two of the best teams in the history of the college football, with a chance to get to the title game here from Miami. Sit back, relax and enjoy. We’ve got a throwback battle of two of the most historic, prolific schools in college football history tonight in the Capital One Orange Bowl. It’s been a long time since either of these two schools have been in the running for a National Championship but they have turned back the clock tonight one of them will punch their ticket to the College Football Playoff National Championship. It’s the Notre Dame Fighting Irish taking on the Penn State Nittany Lions in the CFP semifinal, and AS English will be with you all night providing live coverage, stats, highlights and analysis of tonight’s game form Hard Rock Stadium.",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. For the first time since 2012, Notre Dame will play for a national title. The (7) Fighting Irish advanced to the College Football Playoff National Championship with a 27-24 win against (6) Penn State in Thursday evening's Orange Bowl. Fittingly, in a game that saw four lead changes, it came down to some last-second heroics. Penn State had a chance to win the game. The Nittany Lions took possession on their own 15-yard line with 52 seconds to play and two timeouts. Needing yardage to get into field goal range, they decided to lean on the arm of quarterback Drew Allar, who hopped around in the pocket and tried the middle of the field, where Notre Dame defensive back Christian Gray made a diving interception to give his team possession in Penn State territory. After a couple of runs and a 10-yard connection between quarterback Riley Leonard and wide receiver Jaden Greathouse, Notre Dame worked the ball into field goal range. Kicker Mitch Jeter -- who is now 7 of 8 during Notre Dame's College Football Playoff run -- nailed a 41-yard field goal to send his team to Atlanta. Penn State tried to lateral its way to a miraculous win on one final possession, but Notre Dame's defense was up to the task. This loss especially stings for Penn State, given that it led 10-0 late into the first half. The Nittany Lions also scored 14 unanswered points early in the fourth quarter to take a 24-17 lead -- stoning a 17-0 run from Notre Dame in the process -- and, of course, possessed the ball with less than a minute to play. CBS Sports was here throughout with updates, highlights and analysis. Read on below for takeaways from Notre Dame's win over Penn State. Penn State edge rusher Abdul Carter's status was up in the air ahead of the Orange Bowl. He suffered a left shoulder injury in the quarterfinal round against Boise State that caused him to miss a majority of the game, and most of his left arm was wrapped tonight. Still, he suited up and made his presence felt. Carter finished the game with five total tackles, two for a loss, and one sack. He also collected several quarterback pressures while moving all over the field in Penn State's pass-rush packages. One of those pressured forced Notre Dame quarterback Riley Leonard into throwing an interception. Carter did all that in spite of the fact his left shoulder was still bothering him. Now he's likely off to the NFL Draft, where most projections have him going off the board early in the first round. Penn State running back Nick Singleton deserves special mention for his Herculean efforts. The Nittany Lions star carried the ball 15 times for 84 yards and scored all three of his team's offensive touchdowns. Penn State tight end Tyler Warren also did a lot for the Nittany Lions and finished the game with 96 total yards. But those efforts underscored a serious problem for Penn State, one that tanked its hopes as the game wore on: the Nittany Lions seriously lack in playmakers on the outside. Penn State's wide receivers did not record a single catch on just five targets. Though Warren and Singleton are excellent options, the lack of a threat elsewhere allowed Notre Dame's defense to focus on stopping that dynamic duo. Penn State's final drive was an example: no one was able to get open deep or break a big play. Compare that to Notre Dame, which had a star emerge in sophomore wide receiver Jaden Greathouse. He was a safety valve with the biggest play of the night -- a 54-yard score with a pair of ankle breakers that tied the game at 24 with just under five minutes left to play in the fourth quarter. Third down is the money down for a reason. In a game where Penn State and Notre Dame traded blows and finished with relatively comparable stats (though the Nittany Lions did have a significant rushing advantage) third downs made all the difference. Penn State did almost everything wrong in third-down situations. The Nittany Lions were 3 of 11 and coverted just one in the second half. Notre Dame went 11 of 17 despite some long-to-go situations, gaining an average of seven yards and converting all eight attempts on third-and-short (4 yards or fewer). This is the same Notre Dame team that lost to Northern Illinois early in the year. This is the same Notre Dame team that has lost several of its top players, including a potential first-round cornerback in Benjamin Morrison and its leading sack artist in defensive lineman Rylie Mills, to injury. Through it all, the Fighting Irish have displayed a tremendous amount of grit and determination. That grit was on full display in the Orange Bowl. Quarterback Riley Leonard left the game late in the first half with an apparent head injury. He returned for the first drive in the third quarter, completed a 36 yard pass to Aneyas Williams and then rushed for a 3-yard touchdown to tie the game at 10. One of the key blockers on that play? Offensive lineman Charles Jagusah, who tore his pectoral muscle less than a month before the 2024 season began and only recently started playing again. Early in the fourth quarter, Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love -- who has been limited with a knee injury throughout the College Football Playoff -- plowed through three Penn State defenders and bullied his way into the end zone to give Notre Dame its first lead of the game. Then, with less than a minute to play, Notre Dame cornerback Christian Gray -- who has stepped into an increased role this year due to Morrison's injury -- was the one that intercepted Penn State quarterback Drew Allar. Notre Dame keeps finding a way, and now it's one win from a national title. Notre Dame kicker Mitch Jeter just nailed a 41-yard field goal to give Notre Dame a late lead with less than 10 seconds to play. Penn State will get chance to either tie the game or win, but it's going to take some real heroics since the Nittany Lions are out of timeouts. That was an inexcusable mistake from Penn State quarterback Drew Allar. Trying to lead the Nittany Lions on a potential game-winning drive, he instead threw an ill-advised interception to Notre Dame defensive back Christian Gray. Now Fighting Irish take over in Penn State territory with three timeouts. This after Notre Dame fumbled its own opportunity to potentially walk the game off. On third-and-5 from Penn State's 44-yard line -- not far from field goal range -- quarterback Riley Leonard dropped back to pass. He came under immediate pressure and sacked by Coziah Izzard, forcing the Fighting Irish to punt instead. Penn State will take over at its own 15-yard line with 47 seconds and two timeouts left. As they always say, football is a game of runs. Penn State appeared to be in firm control after ripping off a 14-0 scoring streak, but Notre Dame just swung momentum right back in its favor with a huge touchdown play. Wide receiver Jaden Greathouse got open in Penn State's secondary after a defensive back slipped and fell. Fighting Irish quarterback Riley Leonard hit Greathouse in stride, which allowed him to dance around another Penn State defender in the open field and finish the play by sprinting into the end zone. It's the first passing touchdown for either team and, at 54 yards, is also the longest play all evening. Might want to change Penn State's mascot to the Nick Singletons, because he is literally carrying the offense in the Orange Bowl. The Nittany Lions got the ball inside Notre Dame's 10-yard line thanks to a pass interference penalty on Notre Dame's Adon Shuler. There, Singleton took another handoff and dragged a Notre Dame defender into the end zone for his third touchdown of the night. Penn State was granted that scoring opportunity after Notre Dame quarterback Riley Leonard threw his second interception of the game. This is just Leonard's second multi-interception game of his career; the other was the NIU loss. That was a back-breaking mistake from Notre Dame quarterback Riley Leonard. One play after Notre Dame tied the game with a big touchdown, Leonard stared tight end Mitchell Evans down and thew an interception to Penn State's Dani Dennis-Sutton, who did a good job of undercutting Evans' route and reading Leonard's eyes. It's Penn State's second interception of the night, and it gives the Nittany Lions possession just outside field goal range. Not to be outdone, Penn State running back Nick Singleton just had an incredibly tough run of his own. On second-and-goal from Notre Dame's 7-yard line, Singleton took a handoff, changed direction, made one Notre Dame defender missed and then plowed through another would-be tackler near the goal line to score his second touchdown of the evening. That capped a huge drive for Penn State, which moved the ball down the field -- largely without star tight end Tyler Warren, who missed a chunk in the injury tent after a hard landing -- thanks to some solid play from quarterback Drew Allar. The Nittany Lions needed that answer after allowing 17 straight points to Notre Dame. Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love's knee looks alright. It certainly didn't keep him plowing through Penn State's defense for a crucial touchdown to open the fourth quarter. Love took an inside handoff and bounced off one Penn State defender. As he got near the line of scrimmage, he met a crowd of would-be tacklers, bowled through them and stretched the ball to break into the end zone. It's Notre Dame's second rushing touchdown of the night, and it gives the Irish their first lead. Penn State's offense, which managed just 25 yards in the third quarter, has to find its footing. Entering halftime, it appeared as if Notre Dame was taking on water. But a last-second field goal, and then a hot start to the third quarter, have momentum on the Fighting Irish's side as they enter the fourth quarter of their Orange Bowl showdown against Penn State. Key to Notre Dame's turnaround has been its play in the trenches on both sides of the ball. Though the offensive line has still allowed some leaks, it has done a much better job of opening lanes in the running game and keeping a clean pocket for quarterback Riley Leonard, who scored on a rushing touchdown early in the third quarter to tie the game at 10-all. He also had a big 36-yard completion to Aneyas Williams to put the Irish in scoring range. Defensively, Notre Dame allowed just 25 yards -- including -3 yards rushing -- in the third quarter. The Fighting Irish also got their first sack of the game, courtesy of Rod Heard II, to force a punt near the end of the third frame. Notre Dame will open the fourth quarter with the ball and a chance to take its first lead of the evening. Penn State has had some problems fielding punts in the Orange Bowl. Thus far, none of the decisions have ended in disaster, but it has made things more difficult for the Nittany Lions. After allowing a touchdown on the opening drive in the third quarter, Penn State's defense buckled down and just forced a punt. Return man Zion Tracy, instead of calling for a fair catch in the face of Notre Dame's punt coverage unit, decided to field the kick at the 15-yard line. He was blasted by a Notre Dame gunner and just held on to the ball. Earlier in the first quarter, Tracy called for a fair catch at Penn State's 2-yard line, so he's having some trouble making decisions on the fly. Game on. At one point near the end of the first half, this one seemed to be slipping away from Notre Dame. But a last-second field goal in the second quarter apparently gave the Fighting Irish the momentum they needed to swing the Orange Bowl right back. Riley Leonard looks fine. After exiting the game late in the first half, he led Notre Dame's offense onto the field in the third quarter and looked dialed in. He delivered a perfect 36-yard pass to Aneyas Williams to put Notre Dame in striking distance, and then finished the scoring drive a couple of plays later by rushing into the end zone from three yards out. Notre Dame's offensive line needed that drive. The Irish did a good job creating space in the run game and keeping the pocket clean after a rough first half. The pressure is back on Penn State now. Notre Dame will receive the second half's opening kickoff. There's plenty to keep an eye on as the Fighting Irish take the field. Top of the list is the status of quarterback Riley Leonard, who exited late in the first half with an apparent head injury. Backup Steve Angeli did well to get Notre Dame in field goal range as time expired, but Notre Dame has crafted its offense around Leonard this year. Notre Dame also has a couple of offensive linemen, including starting left tackle Anthonie Knapp, that have been dealing with injuries. Penn State leads Notre Dame 10-3 after the first half of play in the Orange Bowl. The Nittany Lions scored all 10 of their points in the second quarter thanks to a renewed focus on the run game and a pair of lengthy drives that took plenty of time off of the clock. Penn State took 14 plays to kick a 20-yard field goal near the start of the second quarter, and then embarked on a 17-play, 90-yard drive that ended in a 5-yard touchdown with just over two minutes left in the half. The Nittany Lions got 81 of those 90 yards running the ball thanks to an offensive linethat imposed its will. Penn State averaged a brisk 5.4 yards per carry in the first half. Tight end Tyler Warren, who also had 17 yards receiving, contributed 21 yards to Penn State's rushing attack. Penn State's defense also deserves plenty of credit. Notre Dame averaged 22.3 points per game in the first half over its 12-game winning streak entering the Orange Bowl but scored just three points on a last-second field goal in the second quarter. This is also just the second time this season that Notre Dame has trailed at the half. Like the offense, Penn State's defense did a lot of its work in the trenches. Despite having his left arm heavily wrapped, Penn State edge rusher Abdul Carter was a consistent presence in Notre Dame's backfield. He was one of five Penn State players with at least a half tackle for loss and also contributed one of Penn State's three sacks in the first half. To make matters worse for Notre Dame, more key injuries starting to mount. Quarterback Riley Leonard left the game late in the second quarter with an apparent head injury and his status for the second half is up in the air. Notre Dame also lost left tackle Anthonie Knapp and starting guard Rocco Spindler, which undoubtedly contributed to Penn State's dominance at the line of scrimmage. The blows keep mounting for Notre Dame, which is in a 10-0 hole near the end of the first half. Starting quarterback Riley Leonard just took another hit and went to Notre Dame's medical tent at the behest of the game officials. Backup quarterback Steve Angeli entered the game for Leonard, who was able to walk off the field under his own power. What a drive for Penn State. The Nittany Lions moved Notre Dame off of the ball to embark on a 15-play, 90-yard drive that took 7:17 off of the clock and ended with a 5-yard rushing touchdown from running back Nick Singleton. Penn State gathered 81 of those 90 yards on the ground, as Singleton and Kaytron Allen consistently carried the ball for gains of at least five yards. Tight end Tyler Warren also rushed for 21 yards and caught a screen pass for a first down on fourth-and-2 in the red zone. Penn State is in the midst of a dominant drive. The Nittany Lions have worked the ball all the way to the red zone behind a strong rushing effort. They are winning at the point of attack thus far, as running backs Kaytron Allen and Nick Singleton are consistently getting chunk gains to keep the chains moving. Tight end Tyler Warren has also factored heavily into the game plan. He converted a fourth-and-2 with a quick screen catch and also had an athletic run earlier in the drive that turned what looked like a big loss into a gain of nine. Notre Dame starting left tackle Anthonie Knapp was injured following a first-down run from quarterback Riley Leonard. It appeared as if Leonard fell on Knapp's legs as he was getting tackled. Knapp was slow to get up after the play and eventually fell to the turf before making it back to the huddle. He was taken to the locker room with the help of trainers. The Fighting Irish can hardly afford anymore injuries -- especially along the offensive line, where they entered the 2024 season shorthanded. Penn State just took an early lead off of a 20-yard field goal from kicker Ryan Barker, but the Nittany Lions definitely left points on the board. On third-and-goal from Notre Dame's 1-yard line, quarterback Drew Allar short-armed an easy throw in the flats to running back Nick Singleton, who was unable to make the catch. A better throw from Allar and Singleton would have walked into the end zone. Settling for the points was a smart move, though there may have been temptation to go for it. Penn State and Notre Dame are locked in a defensive battle after one quarter of play in the Orange Bowl. Moving the ball hasn't necessarily been an issue -- both teams have at least made it around midfield, and each has had decent chunk gains on offense -- but finishing drives has been an issue. It is a testament to the defensive strength in this matchup. Penn State has been especially impressive. The Nittany Lions forced a crucial turnover, courtesy of a Zakee Wheatley interception, near the end of the first quarter to set up a prime scoring opportunity. Though he has a heavy wrap on his left arm, Penn State edge rusher Abdul Carter is dominating the game early on. He already has one tackle and a couple of quick quarterback pressures -- one of which led to Penn State's interception -- as Notre Dame does not have an answer for him. In spite of the slug fest thus far, Penn State will have a prime scoring opportunity when the second quarter starts. The Nittany Lions face third-and-goal from Notre Dame's 1-yard line. Penn State is going to have favorable field position after the defense forced yet another turnover. On third-and-12 from Notre Dame's 33-yard line, Irish quarterback Riley Leonard tried to hit a wide receiver on a deep crossing route. But the ball sailed well over the intended receiver's head and Penn State defensive back Zakee Wheatley jumped into the air to snag the overthrow. The Nittany Lions will take over on their own 42-yard line with a premium chance to break the scoring seal. Penn State edge rusher Abdul Carter has been favoring his heavily wrapped left arm, but that hasn't stopped him from having a big impact on this game thus far. On Notre Dame's first offensive drive, he cut a quarterback run short with a quick tackle. Then, on the first play of the Irish's second drive, he ripped into the backfield and applied immediate pressure on Riley Leonard, who was forced to throw the ball away before Carter could meet him. He also got pressure on Leonard a couple plays later in the same drive, which resulted in Leonard throwing an interception. Carter still has explosiveness off the edge, even if one of his arms is clipped. Both Notre Dame and Penn State have had an opportunity to make an offensive impression, and each has achieved a nice chunk gain. For the Nittany Lions, quarterback Drew Allar completed a short pass to running back Nick Singleton for a gain of 23 yards. Notre Dame's explosive play came on a 32-yard connection between quarterback Riley Leonard and tight end Mitchell Evans, who made a nice catch with a defensive back draped all over him and picked up extra yardage while tip-toeing the sidelines. But in both instances, the drives stalled around midfield and ended with a punt. It could take a while for a breakthrough to happen. Penn State looked like it was building some early momentum, especially after a 23-yard completion to running back Nick Singleton out of the backfield, but Notre Dame's defense locked things down near midfield. A false start on Penn State gave the Nittany Lions third-and-14 and a short pass to Kaytron Allen came up well short of the sticks. It's worth watching how Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love looks when the Fighting Irish's offense takes the field. He's been dealing with a nagging knee injury, and he was sporting a brace as Notre Dame went through its pregame warm ups. Notre Dame won the toss and deferred its selection to the second half, which means that Penn State will start with the ball. In what's expected to be a low scoring, defensive battle, the Nittany Lions have an opportunity to set the tone with their scripted drive. Expect offensive coordinator Andy Kotelnicki to get creative with his play-calling to try and find weaknesses against an excellent Notre Dame defense. It seems like, at some point, all of the injuries will catch up to Notre Dame. The Irish are in an especially precarious position if Love can't play given what he means to the offense. Yet, Notre Dame has more than made do with its lot as the Irish have continued carving a path of dominance all the way through the postseason against teams deemed by the selection committee as worthy of playing for a national championship. Notre Dame's played dominant along the lines of scrimmage, and it has a proven winner at quarterback in Riley Leonard, who has literally put his body on the line to keep his team's hopes alive. I'm not going to pick against the Irish at this point; they've shown no signs of slowing down. Pick: Notre Dame -2.5 (-105) Notre Dame players and staff members are dealing with a \"flu or a virus\" ahead of Thursday night's College Football Playoff semifinal against Penn State, a school official confirmed in a statement to CBS Sports' Brandon Marcello. The statement downplayed the severity of the outbreak, which it says occurred over the past 10 days to two weeks, and maintains that it will not impact any availability for the Orange Bowl. \"It will have no impact on the game,\" Notre Dame's statement read. \"Beaux Collins was impacted in the Sugar Bowl, but still played and was on the mend during the game.\" © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

                "content": "Nittany Lions conclude first trip to College Football Playoff with 27-24 defeat in semifinal round at the Capital One Orange Bowl MIAMI GARDENS, Fla.- The No. 6 seed Penn State Football team (13-3, 8-1) fell by a final score of 27-24 to No. 7 seed Notre Dame (14-1) on Thursday night in the CFP Semifinal at the Capital One Orange Bowl in Hard Rock Stadium. Penn State answered a 17-0 Notre Dame run with 14 in a row to take a 24-17 lead with under eight minutes to play but a Fighting Irish field goal with seven seconds left was the difference-maker in the Nittany Lions’ 27-24 defeat. Eight tackles for loss, including five sacks, by the Penn State defense held Notre Dame in check, while two interceptions led to 10 points by the Nittany Lion offense. Zakee Wheatley’s team-leading 16 total tackles tied the third-most ever recorded by a Nittany Lion in a Bowl/CFP game, and are the most in a Bowl/CFP game since Lance Mehl posted 17 in the 1979 Sugar Bowl. Wheatley also recorded a sack and an interception in a career outing. Kobe King also recorded nine stops of his own. Dani Dennis-Sutton collected two sacks and an interception, the second of his career, in an outstanding defensive performance. The aforementioned Wheatley, along with Coziah Izzard and Abdul Carter recorded the other three Nittany Lion sacks. Nicholas Singleton became the second player in Penn State history to record three rushing touchdowns in a Bowl/CFP game. He joined Ki-Jana Carter, who ran three in during the 1995 Rose Bowl, in the historic club. Singleton finished with 84 yards and three scores on 15 carries while fellow back Kaytron Allen rushed 19 times for 82 yards. Tight end Tyler Warren wrapped up his record-setting campaign with 75 receiving yards on six catches, while also rushing twice for 21 yards. Warren was once again quarterback Drew Allar’s favorite target. Allar completed 12 of 23 passes for 135 yards. HOW IT HAPPENED An interception by Wheatley on Notre Dame’s second drive of the game gave Penn State’s offense possession at its own 42-yard line. The Nittany Lions converted a fourth down on their way to their first points of the ballgame. A 20-yard field goal by Ryan Barker put Penn State on the board as time expired in the first quarter. Penn State converted another fourth down in the red zone as it recorded the first touchdown of the ballgame. A 15-play, 90-yard drive that chewed up 7:17 of clock was capped off by a five-yard rushing score by Singleton as the Nittany Lions went up 10-0 on the Fighting Irish with 2:18 remaining in the second quarter. Notre Dame kicked a 41-yard field goal as time expired in the first half to make the score 10-3 in favor of Penn State at the halftime break. Yielding just 15 rushing yards and posting four tackles for loss, including three sacks, the Penn State defense kept Notre Dame in check in the first half. Notre Dame evened the score with a touchdown drive to open the second half. Riley Leonard scored the first touchdown of the game for the opposition on a three-yard run at the end of an eight-play, 75-yard drive. A two-yard touchdown run by the Irish put them up 17-10 with 14:07 on the clock in the fourth quarter. Notre Dame took its first lead of the game on a 10-play, 72-yard scoring drive. Penn State responded with a touchdown drive of its own, ending the 17-0 run by the Irish, tying the game at 17. Singleton scored his second rushing touchdown of the day, this time from seven yards out at the end of a seven-play, 75-yard drive. Allar completed two 20-plus yard pass plays on the drive to push Penn State down the field, going to tight ends Warren and Khalil Dinkins. An interception by Dennis-Sutton on the first play of Notre Dame’s ensuing drive put the offense back on the field on the Irish 39-yard line. Singleton’s third rushing touchdown of the game, another seven-yard scamper, put the Nittany Lions back on top at 24-17 with 7:55 left in the fourth quarter. Penn State traveled 39 yards on five plays for the go-ahead tally, capitalizing on another Notre Dame turnover. Notre Dame knotted the score at 24 with a 54-yard touchdown on its next drive. The Fighting Irish took seven plays to go 81 yards for the game-tying score. The Fighting Irish added a 41-yard field goal with seven seconds on the clock to take a 27-24 lead. A last-ditch effort by the Nittany Lions was not successful and Penn State fell 27-24. The 2024 Penn State football season is presented by PSECU. © 2024 Penn State Nittany Lions",

                "title": "Kenneth Fire Map, Updates as Los Angeles Threatened by New Blaze - Newsweek",
                "content": "A new wildfire has erupted in Los Angeles as the emergency services continue to tackle blazes across the city. The Kenneth Fire is believed to have been started intentionally, and a suspect is in custody, per the Los Angeles Police Department. Wildfires, spread by powerful Santa Ana winds, are engulfing much of Los Angeles. Known for their hot, dry nature, Santa Ana winds sap moisture from vegetation, leaving grasses, shrubs and trees highly combustible. Under such conditions, any spark—whether from downed power lines, machinery or natural events such as lightning—can ignite an inferno, with containment efforts significantly hindered by the winds' ferocity. So far, at least 10 people have been killed as a result of the wildfires, the County of Los Angeles Department of Medical Examiner said Thursday evening. Meanwhile, nearly 180,000 people are under evacuation orders as a result of the fires. The Kenneth Fire began at around 3:30 p.m. local time on Thursday in Woodland Hills and it has burned across almost 1,000 acres, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department. Authorities shut down a portion of Highway 101 in response. While the fire grew quickly in just a couple hours, it is now spreading more slowly, CNN reported. So far, it has been 35 percent contained. More than 60 fire companies were sent to respond to the blaze, Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley said. Authorities believe the fire was started intentionally. In a 4:30 p.m. radio call, \"a male was heard stating a suspect was attempting to light a fire\" in Woodland Hills, at the 21700 block of Ybarra Road in Los Angeles, an LAPD official told Newsweek. The call came about two hours after the Kenneth wildfire was first reported. Police added that officers arrived and apprehended a suspect. Meanwhile, Los Angeles County Supervisor Janice Hahn was forced to apologise in a post on X after millions of residents across the greater Los Angeles area mistakenly received an evacuation warning alert on their phones late Thursday afternoon local time that was meant for the areas impacted by the Kenneth Fire. \"It was meant to be for the areas impacted by the Kenneth Fire in Woodland Hills,\" Hahn said. Officials quickly worked to correct the notice, which had indicated that recipients should be ready to leave their area immediately if called upon due to surrounding wildfires. Hahn said many had received the alerts by mistake \"due to a technical error.\" It comes as at least four other fires are burning in the city. Those include the Palisades Fire, which has burned across at least 19,978 acres and has been 6 percent contained, the Hurst Fire, which has burned at least 771 acres and has been 37 percent contained, and the Lidia Fire, which has burned at least 394 acres and has been 75 percent contained. The Eaton Fire has burned 13,690 acres, with zero containment as of Friday. Containment numbers should go up as weather conditions improve, according to Capt. Adam VanGerpen, spokesperson for the Los Angeles Fire Department. \"We have about 2,300 firefighters just at the Palisades Fire ... we have firefighters coming in from all over the state,\" he told CNN. At least 10 people have been killed as a result of the wildfires and that number could rise as the blazes spread, with no sign of an ending in sight. Nearly 180,000 people are under evacuation orders as a result of the fires, which have caused a huge amount of damage to property and possessions, disrupting the normal operation of the city and hurting the local economy. Cal Fire wrote on its website: \"Fanned by strong Santa Ana winds, the fire threatens nearby communities and infrastructure, prompting swift evacuation orders. Firefighters from Los Angeles and Ventura counties are actively engaged in containment efforts, deploying both ground crews and aerial resources.\" Fire crews are continuing to fight the wildfires. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said residents should continue to heed emergency orders from the Los Angeles Fire Department and first responders.

                "title": "Trump's sentencing ends with no punishment, as judge wishes him 'godspeed' in his second term in office",
                "content": "Manage your account Trump's Friday morning sentencing was over in a breezy 30 minutes. As expected, he received zero punishment and a scolding by prosecutors and the judge. Trump addressed the court virtually for under 10 minutes, criticizing the \"witch hunt\" against him. After months of delay, Donald Trump's criminal case is finally closed. For a breezily-paced half hour, the president-elect listened and watched via video from Mar-a-Lago as a Manhattan prosecutor decried his \"dangerous rhetoric\" and his defense lawyer promised to appeal the case. Trump — slumped over a table and visible in the courtroom on overhead screens — then delivered a brief, 7-minute statement of protest against the \"witch hunt\" against him. The judge, New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan, handed down a sentence of no punishment as expected. It came with a brief statement of chastisement. Merchan, reading from paperwork before him at the bench, said no ordinary citizen would have received the legal breaks enjoyed by Trump. \"At this time, I impose that sentence to cover all 34 counts,\" Merchan then said, referring to Trump's felony conviction and his sentence of no jail, no probation, no fines, and no community service. \"Sir,\" the judge then said in conclusion, \"I wish you godspeed as you assume your second term in office.\" At the start of the Friday sentencing hearing, Manhattan prosecutor Joshua Steinglass condemned the former and future president, saying he \"engaged in a coordinated campaign to undermine\" the legitimacy of the trial that Trump faced seven months ago and \"caused enduring damage to public perception of the criminal justice system.\" \"Far from expressing any kind of remorse for his criminal conduct, the defendant has purposefully bred disdain for our judicial institutions and the rule of law, and he's done this to serve his own ends,\" Steinglass told the court. The assistant district attorney, speaking as Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg sat behind him, said the court had found Trump in contempt for 10 different violations for extra-judicial speech. Friday's sentencing brings a delayed capstone to the criminal case just 10 days before Trump is scheduled to be sworn in again as the president of the United States. Trump appeared by video from his Florida estate, sitting alongside his defense lawyer Todd Blanche with a pair of gold-fringed American flags draped behind them. Emil Bove, another of his attorneys, was the only person sitting at the defense table in Merchan's lower Manhattan courtroom. \"It's been a political witch hunt,\" Trump said when given the opportunity to speak. \"It was done to damage my reputation so that I'd lose the election, and obviously that didn't work.\" In May, a Manhattan jury found Trump guilty of all 34 felony counts prosecutors brought against him, finding he falsified business records in order to disguise hush-money payments to Stormy Daniels, a porn star who testified she had a brief affair with him ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Before Trump was sentenced, the case was thrown into turmoil after the US Supreme Court ruled in July that the president is entitled to sweeping criminal immunity protections. Although Trump was no longer president, and much of the conduct in his case took place before his first term, the Supreme Court ruled the immunity protections were so vast that it even precluded evidence from being admitted in a criminal proceeding. Trump's attorneys asked Merchan to delay the sentencing indefinitely and throw out the case. The judge ultimately set Friday's date, writing that only a sentencing hearing before Trump's second term would respect the jury verdict — as well as allow Trump to appeal his case like any other ordinary defendant. Just 14 hours beforehand, a narrow US Supreme Court majority swatted down Trump's last legal efforts to halt the sentencing. The Supreme Court's immunity decision gave Trump protections that \"ordinary citizens\" do not receive, but they did not \"reduce the seriousness of the crime or justify its commission in any way,\" Merchan said Friday. \"The protections are, however, a legal mandate, which pursuant to the rule of law, this court must respect and follow,\" Merchan said. \"However, despite the extraordinary breadth of those protections, one power they do not provide is the power to erase a jury verdict.\" Read the original article on Business Insider",

                "content": "Donald Trump avoids jail time or a fine, but the US president-elect’s criminal conviction will be on his record. Donald Trump has become the first former United States president ever sentenced for a crime. But the US president-elect avoided penalties for his conviction for falsifying business documents in relation to hush-money payments made to an adult film actress. Judge Juan Merchan sentenced Trump to an “unconditional discharge” on Friday, a day after the US Supreme Court rejected an attempt by Trump’s legal team to delay the sentencing, which took place before the Republican leader’s inauguration on January 20. The decision means that Trump’s conviction will appear on his permanent record, but he does not face imprisonment, a fine or probation — leaving him unencumbered to enter the White House. Trump, who previously served as president from 2017 to 2021, was found guilty in late May on 34 counts of falsifying business documents related to a $130,000 payment made to Stormy Daniels, among other things. The US president-elect has denied any wrongdoing and said he plans to appeal his conviction. Appearing virtually at Friday’s sentencing hearing, Trump said his criminal trial and conviction had “been a very terrible experience” and insisted he committed no crime. “It’s been a political witch-hunt,” Trump said before the judge issued his decision. “It was done to damage my reputation so I would lose the election and obviously that didn’t work.” Prosecutors in the New York case had argued that the hush-money payments aimed to conceal allegations of a sexual relationship with Daniels that could have been politically damaging. The payments were made ahead of the 2016 US presidential election, which saw Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton to win the White House. Trump, who pleaded not guilty in the case, has denied any sexual relationship took place. Reporting from Washington, DC, on Friday morning, Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher said prosecutors had argued “it was important that Donald Trump was held responsible”. “The judge himself said this was a unique and difficult case, but in the end, he decided that the sentence had to be an unconditional discharge,” Fisher said. Under New York’s penal code, a court can sentence a defendant to an unconditional discharge if it “is of the opinion that no proper purpose would be served by imposing any condition upon the defendant’s release”. Earlier this week, Trump’s lawyers had asked the Supreme Court to delay the sentencing “to prevent grave injustice and harm to the institution of the Presidency and the operations of the federal government”. They argued that a ruling last year by the top court grants presidents broad immunity from criminal prosecution, and that means some of the evidence should not have been presented in the case. But a majority of the justices on the Supreme Court said in a decision late on Thursday that the “alleged evidentiary violations” at Trump’s state-court trial “can be addressed in the ordinary course on appeal”. They also said “the burden that sentencing will impose” on Trump’s responsibilities “is relatively insubstantial in light of the trial court’s stated intent to impose a sentence of ‘unconditional discharge’ after a brief virtual hearing”. Now that he has been sentenced, Trump is free to pursue the appeal, a process that could take years and play out while he is serving his second four-year term as president. “Today’s event was a despicable charade, and now that it is over, we will appeal this Hoax, which has no merit, and restore the trust of Americans in our once great System of Justice,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform after his sentencing.

                "title": "Restrictions on TikTok in the United States - Wikipedia",
                "content": "TikTok has sparked concerns over potential user data collection and influence operations by the Chinese government, leading to restrictions and bans in the United States. In January 2020, the United States Army and Navy banned TikTok on government devices after the Defense Department labeled it a security risk. Before the policy change, army recruiters had been using the platform to attract young people. Unofficial promotional videos continue to be posted on TikTok under personal accounts, drawing the ire of government officials, but they have also helped boost the number of enlistees; several accounts have millions of views and followers.[1][2][3] In 2020, the United States government announced that it was considering banning the Chinese social media platform TikTok upon a request from then-president Donald Trump, who viewed the app as a national security threat. The result was that TikTok owner ByteDance—which initially planned on selling a small portion of TikTok to an American company—agreed to divest TikTok to prevent a ban in the United States and in other countries where restrictions are also being considered due to privacy concerns, which themselves are mostly related to its ownership by a firm based in China. TikTok later announced plans to file legal action challenging the order's transactional prohibitions with U.S. companies. The lawsuit against the Trump Administration's order was filed on August 24, 2020, with TikTok arguing that the order was motivated by Trump's efforts to boost re-election support through protectionist trade policies aimed at China. A separate suit filed the same day by TikTok's U.S. technical program manager Patrick Ryan against Trump and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross sought a temporary restraining order, arguing that his due process rights were violated and the ban was an \"unconstitutional taking\" of Ryan's property under the Fifth Amendment; the suit also claimed Trump's action was likely a retaliation because of TikTok videos organizing pranks against a recent Trump campaign rally. On June 9, 2021, the Biden Administration issued Executive Order 14034, \"Protecting Americans' Sensitive Data from Foreign Adversaries\" (\"EO 14034\"). EO 14034, overturning three Executive Orders signed by Donald Trump: Executive Order 13942, Executive Order 13943, and Executive Order 13971. Despite revoking these Executive Orders, the Biden Administration's EO 14304 has called upon other federal agencies to continue a broad review of foreign-owned applications set to continuously inform the President of the risk that the applications pose to personal data and national security.[4] The White House said that, \"The Biden Administration is committed to promoting an open, interoperable, reliable, and secure Internet; protecting human rights online and offline; and supporting a vibrant, global digital economy.\"[5] In December 2022, Senator Marco Rubio and representatives Mike Gallagher and Raja Krishnamoorthi introduced the Averting the National Threat of Internet Surveillance, Oppressive Censorship and Influence, and Algorithmic Learning by the Chinese Communist Party Act (ANTI-SOCIAL CCP Act), which would prohibit Chinese- and Russian-owned social networks from doing business in the United States.[6][7] On December 30, 2022, President Joe Biden signed the No TikTok on Government Devices Act, prohibiting the use of the app on devices owned by the federal government, with some exceptions.[8] Days after the Biden administration called on ByteDance, which owns TikTok, to sell the platform or face a ban, law enforcement officials disclosed that an investigation into TikTok was taking place. On March 17, 2023, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) officially launched an investigation of TikTok, including allegations that the company spied on American journalists.[9] On January 25, 2023, Missouri Senator Josh Hawley introduced a bill to ban the platform nationwide. That bill was blocked by a forced vote in the Senate on 29 March 2023.[10] In February and March 2023, the DATA Act and the RESTRICT Act were both introduced in the House of Representatives and Senate, respectively. The DATA Act, introduced on February 24 by Michael McCaul, aimed to ban selling non-public personal data to third-party buyers.[11] On March 7, Senator Mark Warner introduced the RESTRICT Act: if passed, it would give the Secretary of Commerce authority to review business transactions made by IT service and product vendors tied to designated \"foreign adversaries\" if they present an undue threat to national security, and have more than one million active users in the United States. The legislation would allow for the enforcement of orders and other mitigation measures, which could include mandatory divestment, or being prohibited from doing business in the United States.[12] On March 13, 2024, the United States House of Representatives passed the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (H.R. 7521) with largely bipartisan support from Democrat and Republican-party representatives.[13][14] It would ban operations related to the app completely within the country unless ByteDance makes a qualified divestiture as determined by the US president.[15] After modifications, the act passed the House again[16][17] and the United States Senate[18] before it was signed into law by Joe Biden on April 24, 2024. The earliest the ban could go into effect if not sold would be January 19, 2025. An additional 90 days could be issued on the deadline.[19] TikTok, Inc. v. Garland is a lawsuit brought by social media company TikTok against the United States government. Chinese internet technology company ByteDance Ltd. and its subsidiary TikTok, Inc. claim that the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA) violates the Freedom of Speech Clause of the First Amendment, the Bill of Attainder Clause of Article One, Section Nine, and the Due Process Clause and Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment.[20][21][22] The law bans or requires divestment of social media apps meeting specified criteria that are owned by foreign corporations from, or by corporations owned by foreign nationals from, countries designated as U.S. foreign adversaries and that have been determined by the President to present a significant national security threat, and explicitly defines TikTok and any application operated by a ByteDance subsidiary as a \"foreign adversary controlled application\" under the law.[23] Trump campaigned on promises of not banning TikTok, despite his original opposition.[34][35] Trump's cabinet picks for the FCC, as well as most Republicans, remain in favor of banning the app.[34] As of April 2023,[36][37] at least 34 out of 50 states have announced or enacted bans on state government agencies, employees, and contractors using TikTok on government-issued devices. State bans only affect government employees and do not prohibit civilians from having or using the app on their personal devices. Some public universities have also banned TikTok on campus Wi-Fi and university-owned computers. These include, but are not limited to: On April 14, 2023, Montana became the first state to pass legislation banning TikTok on all personal devices operating within state lines, and barring app stores from offering TikTok for download.[86][87][88] Governor Greg Gianforte signed the bill, Senate Bill (SB) 419, into law on May 17,[89][90] claiming he had banned TikTok \"to protect Montanans’ personal and private data from the Chinese Communist Party.\"[91] The law was scheduled to take effect in January 2024.[89] However, Montana content creators filed suit against the state once the bill was signed.[92][93] The creators' lawsuit is financed and directed by TikTok, with law firm Davis Wright Tremaine representing them.[94] The ban was blocked by US District Judge Donald W. Molloy on December 1, 2023, as he stated the ban \"infringes on the Constitutional right of users and businesses\". Due to the block, the ban did not come into effect as planned.[95] On January 2, 2024, Montana filed a notice to appeal the ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.[96] Groups such as the ACLU and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) opposed the ban, stating it constituted \"censorship\" and \"would set an alarming precedent for excessive government control over how Montanans use the internet.\"[97] Lobbying group NetChoice argued that the ban is an unconstitutional bill of attainder and also violates the freedom of speech clause of the First Amendment.[98] Hours after the bill was signed into law, five TikTok creators filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Montana against the state. A spokeswoman for Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen said that the state is \"fully prepared to defend the law\".[99] In a preliminary ruling November 30, 2023, federal judge Donald Molloy blocked the law citing constitutional concerns.[100] Specifically, Judge Molloy wrote that \"the State fails to show how SB 419 is constitutionally permissible.\"[101][102] The law faces technical restrictions. The App Store and Google Play Store track users by country, not by state, and would need to define the behavior when a user crosses state lines. While Apple and Google may be able to use IP addresses to track device locations, users may be able to use a virtual private network (VPN) to circumvent the restriction. If these app stores are found to be hosting TikTok for Montana users, violators could face fines of $10,000 per day.[103] TikTok has stated that it would need to collect data from users in order to comply with the bill.[104] In July 2020, Wells Fargo banned the app from company devices due to privacy and security concerns.[105] In August 2023, New York City banned TikTok on government-owned devices for security reasons.[106] A July 2020 poll from Morning Consult, with 2,200 surveyed, found that 29% of American adults supported a TikTok ban, 33% opposed one, and 38% had no opinion.[107] An August 2020 poll from Reuters/Ipsos, surveying 1,349, had 40% supporting Trump's move to ban the app, 30% opposed, and 30% uncertain.[108] A December 2022 poll from Rasmussen Reports, surveying 1,000 likely U.S. voters, found that 68% supported proposals to federally ban TikTok, with 43% strongly supporting a ban. Conversely, 24% surveyed were opposed, including 12% who strongly opposed.[109] A March 2023 poll from The Washington Post, surveying 1,027 American adults, found that 41% supported the federal government banning TikTok, while 25% remain opposed to a ban.[110] Another March poll, from Pew Research Center, found twice as many adult Americans support the U.S. government's ban on TikTok as oppose it (50% vs. 22%), though a significant portion (28%) remain unsure.[111] A December 2023 poll from Pew Research Center found 38% in favor of a ban, reflecting a decrease among Republicans even amid renewed efforts by their party leaders to ban the app.[112] A February 2024 poll by the Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found 31% of the respondents were in favor of a nationwide ban of TikTok, while 35% said they were opposed to it. Overall 56% said they supported a limited ban on government devices.[113] An April 2024 poll by Reuters/Ipsos found that a majority of Americans believe that TikTok is used by the Chinese government to influence public opinion.[114] TikTok began working on Project Texas after 2020 to address data concerns from the US government.[115] From 2019 to 2024, TikTok and ByteDance combined spent $27 million on lobbying in the United States, including their hire of SKDK, a public affairs firm, in 2023 according to Politico.[116][117] Reuters reported that according to its sources, if all legal methods to block the April 2024 ban are exhausted, ByteDance would prefer to shut down TikTok than sell it with its core algorithm, which is also subject to China's export control.[118] On May 7, 2024, ByteDance and TikTok filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to overturn the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act.[119][120] Some advertisers increased their spending on TikTok in 2023. Edward East, CEO of marketing agency Billion Dollar Boy, stated that instead of being intimidated by a potential ban, the industry is seeing an increase in brand investment through TikTok.[121] In May 2024, trade association NetChoice removed TikTok as a member after facing pressures and potential investigations by US lawmakers. NetChoice had previously defended TikTok.[122] Following the passing of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, eight TikTok content creators sued the United States government on May 14, 2024, in United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in an effort to overturn the act; the choice of venue was due to a provision in the act making it the \"exclusive jurisdiction\" for legal challenges of the act.[123] In March 2024, a spokesperson for Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China said the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act was putting the U.S. on \"the opposite side of the principle of fair competition and international economic and trade rules.\"[124] Representatives from the Embassy of China in Washington, D.C. met with U.S. congressional staffers to lobby against the bill.[125] The Central Propaganda Department of the Chinese Communist Party also instructed the country's state media outlets to increase positive coverage of ByteDance, although overall Beijing's response seems to be muted so far.[126] Bans and attempted bans in the United States have drawn objections citing hypocrisy, protectionism, and not addressing user data privacy in general. Lawmakers making allegations against TikTok fail to mention that the United States itself surveils non-US nationals under Section 702 of FISA.[127] The types of data collected by TikTok are also collected by other social media platforms and sold through brokers to private buyers and reportedly government agencies as well, without oversight.[127][128] A researcher at Georgia Tech's Internet Governance Project is concerned that Washington's attempt to protect the US market could backfire.[127] Some researchers from the Citizen Lab and the Center for Strategic and International Studies stated that user information in general should be protected, not just focusing on one platform.[128][129] There has been no public evidence of American TikTok user data being accessed by the Chinese government.[130][131][132] Critics have also labeled a potential ban on the app an assault on freedom of speech, including congressmen Rand Paul and Thomas Massie.[133][134]",

                "title": "How the US TikTok Ban Would Actually Work | WIRED",
                "content": "TikTok’s day of reckoning in the US has arrived. On Friday, the United States Supreme Court will hear the company’s appeal against its slated nationwide ban, which could come into force in a little more than a week if the company’s efforts fail. The social video app, which is owned by Chinese firm ByteDance and is used by around 170 million Americans, has been appealing the ban since US president Joe Biden signed the law underpinning it last year. The Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA) states that ByteDance must sell TikTok’s US business to a non-Chinese company by January 19—no buyer has yet been found—or see the app blocked in the US. Donald Trump, who retakes the White House on January 20, publicly originated the idea that ByteDance be forced to sell TikTok during his first presidential term but has since reversed course. The Supreme Court, which is hearing the case quickly due to the impending deadline and following a federal court upholding the ban in December, will determine whether the US Constitution’s First Amendment right to free speech is overruled by the government’s belief that TikTok is a threat to US national security. Proponents of PAFACA claim TikTok’s Chinese ownership could allow China to steal data on Americans and spread disinformation—although little evidence has been presented to support those claims, which the company denies. If the court allows the ban to go ahead—and Trump doesn’t find a way to stop it—the move will be an unprecedented technological clampdown in the country. “This is the first time we’ve seen a national-level ban that appears imminent in the United States,” says Joseph Lorenzo Hall, a distinguished technologist at the Internet Society. TikTok has been banned or faces lawsuits in other countries, such as India, and the pressures come against the backdrop of total internet shutdowns and increased online censorship. “What we learned from all of those is that this ends up really hurting the people of the country, that the economic effects are immediate for people,” Hall says. So, how would TikTok actually be banned? Unpicking TikTok from the nation’s consciousness—thousands of influencers and businesses use the app to make money and promote themselves—is not exactly straightforward. Nor is it simple to untangle the company from US-based internet infrastructure. PAFACA doesn’t require anyone to uninstall TikTok from their phones. It also doesn’t say TikTok should directly stop its services from working in the US. Instead, it effectively tries to throttle TikTok by making it harder to use over time and by stopping companies from providing services that help it to keep working and quickly loading videos. TikTok, as with all companies mentioned in this story, did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment and hasn’t, at this stage, outlined what technical steps it will or will not take if the ban does eventually come into place. The law says it will be “unlawful” for entities to “distribute, maintain or update” the app including its source code, or by “providing services” that allow it to keep running as it is now. This distribution, maintenance, or updates could be, the law says, by means of mobile app stores that can be accessed in the US or by “providing internet hosting services.” “The law really deliberately avoided saying that it was illegal to have the app on your phone,” says Milton Mueller, a professor and cofounder of the Internet Governance Project at the Georgia Institute of Technology, who filed an amicus brief to the Supreme Court in opposition of the ban. “Their attempt is to say nobody new can download it from the Apple or Google stores, and nobody who has it can update it through those stores,” Mueller says. “There’s nothing in the law that says ‘TikTok you must block US users,’ which is again interesting.” If TikTok is removed from Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store in the US, it will not be possible to directly install new updates that will add new features, fix bugs within the code, or quash security flaws. Over time, that means TikTok will stop functioning properly. Apple didn’t respond to WIRED’s request for comment, while Google declined to comment on what it will do if the law comes into effect. The law’s other focus is on stopping “hosting” companies from providing services to TikTok—and the definition is pretty wide. Hosting companies “may include file hosting, domain name server hosting, cloud hosting, and virtual private server hosting,” the law says. Since the summer of 2022, as TikTok faced pressure about its Chinese ownership, the company has hosted US user data within Oracle’s cloud services. Oracle also did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment. Even so, other systems such as content delivery networks, advertising networks, payment providers, and more are used as part of TikTok’s infrastructure. The law does not specifically mention these services, but differing legal readings could make them question whether they help to “maintain” or “distribute” TikTok’s fully functioning service. Hall says a recent test of TikTok’s website showed 185 embedded domains on the page. “They pull in code, content from that array of third-party providers and their own domains too,” he says. “The apps will start to decay and rot as either services stop working, things like content distribution networks or services who feel like they can't take the risks of the ambiguous nature of the language or the potential enforcement by the incoming administration.” There’s one internet infrastructure player that the ban does not specifically put pressure on: internet service providers. Countries such as Russia and China have developed censorship measures that allow them to block entire websites from being accessed through web bowsers. Mueller believes this omission by US lawmakers was likely deliberate, as it avoids setting up a Chinese-style internet firewall. “They knew that a system of ISP-based blocking and filtering would obviously be a form of First Amendment restriction,” he says. While TikTok’s service in the US would likely degrade over time, there remain some potential ways around any ban—both for individuals and potentially also the company itself. How effective these measures would be likely depends on how motivated people are to keep using TikTok and what the company decides to do. “TikTok has 170 million users,” says Alan Rozenshtein, an associate professor of law at the University of Minnesota, who is in favor of the law but says it is the “best of a bunch of bad options” relating to TikTok. “This law will not prevent every one of them from accessing TikTok. I don’t think that was ever the goal of the law. The law is to make it meaningfully harder to access TikTok.” Theoretically, at least, TikTok could shift its services providers—such as hosting companies or content delivery networks—to be based outside of the United States. Using technical infrastructure based abroad, for instance in Europe, could allow TikTok to be served to people in the US while operating within the bounds of the law. While skirting the full-blown ban would allow people in the US to continue to use the app, that doesn’t mean the experience will be good. If videos are served from international locations, for example, load times may be slower for users, and it may be harder to upload videos. Using TikTok’s website isn’t the same experience as what the app provides, either. And that all depends on such a setup being possible at all. “I do think that the number of companies that can do that, that are not headquartered in the US, is going to be small, especially considering how hard it is to switch from one cloud provider to another,” Hall says. “It’s really difficult depending on a number of factors.” Aside from technical challenges, international companies may not be willing to risk flying in the face of US restrictions, particularly under an aggressive Trump administration that has already threatened Greenland and economic penalties on other countries. A TikTok ban would almost guarantee a spike in searches and downloads of virtual private networks (VPNs), which allow people to appear as if they are in a different geographic location to get around restrictions on content—for instance, trying to watch Netflix while abroad. Using a VPN within the US may allow the TikTok app to keep working, although it is unclear whether the company will place any restrictions on users it can determine are in the US by other means. The company’s support pages say SIM card registration details and other information can be used to pinpoint someone’s location. Alternatively, it is likely Android users could download versions of TikTok outside of Google’s Play Store and install them on their devices. However, sideloading like this can come with security risks if the apps are not verified, and doing the same on an iPhone, via jailbreaking the device, is more technically complex. Equally, moves such as changing locations of app stores to be outside of the US may come with unforeseen consequences and prove harder to maintain for general users in the long term. For instance, if you are changing an iCloud account’s location, Apple advises that you may need to cancel subscriptions and have a valid payment method for the location you are changing it to. Prateek Waghre, a technology policy researcher based in India, where TikTok has been banned for four years and, despite an influx of some homegrown competitors, largely saw people move to Instagram Reels or YouTube’s Shorts, says overall restrictions on apps and websites weakens people’s experiences online and damages the internet as a whole. “For many of us, [it is] the realization of one of our fears of a ‘splinternet,’” Waghre says. “You will have different kinds of access based on different geography, which is not what the experience of the internet was.” In your inbox: Our biggest stories, handpicked for you each day License plate readers are leaking live video feeds and vehicle data CES 2025: All the products, trends, and quirky gadgets we’ve seen The 17 best EVs coming in 2025 Visualization: We’re tracking every AI copyright lawsuit in the US More From WIRED Reviews and Guides © 2025 Condé Nast.

                "content": "Advertisement Supported by TikTok will make its case to the Supreme Court on Friday after losing a challenge to a federal law that could ban the short-form video app. By Sapna Maheshwari and Amanda Holpuch TikTok will make its case before the Supreme Court on Friday, challenging a law that seeks to ban the short-form video app in the United States. Concerns that the Chinese government could gain access to sensitive user data through the app, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, prompted Congress to pass legislation that would ban the social media platform unless it was sold to a government-approved buyer. President Biden signed the legislation into law in April, giving ByteDance until Jan. 19 to divest from TikTok. The company lost its first legal effort to overturn the law on Dec. 6 when a panel of three federal judges unanimously rejected TikTok’s argument that the law violated the First Amendment. There is a chance that President-elect Donald J. Trump will try to rescue the app, which boasts 170 million users in the United States, but the law is scheduled to go into effect the day before his inauguration. Here’s why the pressure has been ratcheted up on TikTok and what it means for users. Lawmakers and regulators in the West have increasingly expressed concern that TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance, may put sensitive user data, like location information, into the hands of the Chinese government. They have pointed to laws that allow the Chinese government to secretly demand data from Chinese companies and citizens for intelligence-gathering operations. They are also worried that China could use TikTok’s content recommendations to fuel misinformation, a concern that escalated in the United States after the start of the Israeli-Hamas war and during the presidential election. Critics say TikTok has fueled the spread of antisemitism. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

                "title": "Anita Bryant - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Anita Jane Bryant (March 25, 1940 – December 16, 2024) was an American singer and a Christian activist against gay rights in the United States. She had three top 20 hits in the United States in the early 1960s. She was the 1958 Miss Oklahoma beauty pageant winner, and a brand ambassador for the Florida Citrus Commission from 1969 to 1980. From 1977 to 1980, Bryant was an outspoken Christian opponent of gay rights in the United States. In 1977, she ran the Save Our Children campaign to repeal a local ordinance in Miami-Dade County, Florida, that outlawed discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Supporters of gay rights in the United States condemned Bryant for her campaign. They were assisted by many other prominent figures in music, film, and television, and retaliated by boycotting the orange juice that she promoted. Though the campaign ended successfully with a 69% majority vote to repeal the ordinance on June 7, 1977 (Dade County later restored the ordinance in 1998), it permanently damaged her public image, and her contract with the Florida Citrus Commission was terminated three years later. This, as well as her later divorce from Bob Green, damaged her financially. Bryant never regained her former prominence and filed for bankruptcy twice. Bryant was born on March 25, 1940, in Barnsdall, Oklahoma, the daughter of Lenora A. (Berry) and Warren Bryant.[2] After her parents divorced, her father went into the U.S. Army and her mother went to work as a clerk for Tinker Air Force Base.[3] She began singing at the age of 2 at the First Baptist church in Barnsdall, with \"Jesus Loves Me\".[4] She was singing onstage at the age of six,[citation needed] at local fairgrounds in Oklahoma. She sang occasionally on radio and television, and was invited to audition when Arthur Godfrey's talent show came to town, eventually winning the contest.[3] At age 12, she had her television show The Anita Bryant Show, which aired on WKY (now KFOR-TV).[5] Bryant became Miss Oklahoma in 1958, right after graduating from Tulsa's Will Rogers High School, and was second runner-up in the 1959 Miss America pageant (held September 6, 1958) at age 18.[6] She appeared early in her career on the NBC interview program Here's Hollywood[citation needed] and on the same network's The Ford Show, starring Tennessee Ernie Ford.[3] Bryant released several albums on the Carlton and Columbia labels.[citation needed] Her first album, Anita Bryant, which was released in 1959, contained \"Till There Was You\" and songs from other Broadway shows.[citation needed] Her second album, Hear Anita Bryant in Your Home Tonight (1961), contains \"Paper Roses\" and \"Wonderland by Night\", as well as several songs that first appeared in her singles.[citation needed] Her third album, In My Little Corner of the World, also in 1961, contains the title song and other songs that have to do with places around the world, including \"Canadian Sunset\" and \"I Love Paris\".[citation needed] Bryant's compilation album, Greatest Hits (1963), contains both her original Carlton hits (because Columbia purchased all the masters from Carlton) plus sides from her Columbia recordings, including \"Paper Roses\" and \"Step by Step, Little by Little\".[citation needed] In 1964, she released The World of Lonely People, containing, in addition to the title song, \"Welcome, Welcome Home\" and a new rendition of \"Little Things Mean a Lot\", arranged by Frank Hunter. Bryant also released several albums of religious music.[citation needed] Bryant had a moderate pop hit with the song \"Till There Was You\" (1959, US No. 30), from the Broadway production The Music Man. She also had three hits that reached the Top 20 in the U.S.: \"Paper Roses\" (1960, US No. 5, and covered by Marie Osmond 13 years later), \"In My Little Corner of the World\" (1960, US No. 10), and \"Wonderland by Night\" (1961, US No. 18), originally a hit for Bert Kaempfert. \"Paper Roses\", \"In My Little Corner of the World\", and \"Till There Was You\", each sold over one million copies, and were awarded a gold disc by the RIAA.[7] From 1961 until 1968, Bryant frequently joined Bob Hope on holiday tours for the United Service Organizations.[3] She again traveled with Hope for televised shows during the Vietnam War.[8][9] Bryant was given the Silver Medallion Award from the National Guard for \"outstanding service by an entertainer\", and the Veterans of Foreign Wars Leadership Gold Medallion.[10] Between 1964 and 1969, Bryant performed at multiple White House functions, including both the Democratic Convention in Chicago and the Miami Republican Convention in 1968.[11] In 1967, with I Believe she moved towards gospel which would also characterize the music of her other albums.[12] In 1969, Bryant became a spokeswoman for the Florida Citrus Commission, and nationally televised commercials featured her singing \"Come to the Florida Sunshine Tree\" and stating the commercials' tagline: \"Breakfast without orange juice is like a day without sunshine.\"[3] (Later, the slogan became, \"It isn't just for breakfast anymore!\") In addition during that time, she appeared in advertisements for Coca-Cola, Kraft Foods, Holiday Inn, and Tupperware. In the 1970s, Bryant was teamed up with the Disney Character \"Orange Bird\", with whom she appeared in several orange juice commercials. She also sang the Orange Bird Song and narrated the Orange Bird record album, with music written by the Sherman Brothers. She also published her cookbook, Bless This Food: The Anita Bryant Family Cookbook, described as \"Much more than a cookbook, this is the story of a family devoted to Christ.\"[11] Bryant sang \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\" during the half-time show of Super Bowl V in 1971, and at the graveside services for President of the United States Lyndon B. Johnson in 1973.[3] Bryant hosted a two-hour television special, The Anita Bryant Spectacular, in March 1980.[13] She recounted her autobiography, appeared in medleys of prerecorded songs, and interviewed Pat Boone. The West Point Glee Club and General William Westmoreland participated.[14] In 1977, Dade County, Florida, passed an ordinance sponsored by Bryant's former friend Ruth Shack that prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.[15] Bryant led a highly publicized campaign to repeal the ordinance, as the leader of a coalition named Save Our Children.[3] The singer was especially concerned about the fact that the ordinance risked authorizing homosexual people to work in Christian schools and become role-models, because her own children were enrolled there.[16] The campaign was based on conservative Christian beliefs regarding the sinfulness of homosexuality and the proposed threat of homosexual recruitment of children and child molestation.[17] Bryant stated: What these people really want, hidden behind obscure legal phrases, is the legal right to propose to our children that theirs is an acceptable alternate way of life. ... I will lead such a crusade to stop it as this country has not seen before.[17] She also perpetuated the idea of the gay community 'recruiting' children through child abuse to become homosexual themselves.[3] When Shack and other leaders refused to vote in opposition to the ordinance as per her request, she pleaded with families directly \"The recruitment of our children is absolutely necessary for the survival and growth of homosexuality… for since homosexuals cannot reproduce, they must recruit, must freshen their ranks.\"[11] The campaign marked the beginning of an organized opposition to gay rights that spread across the nation.[18] Jerry Falwell went to Miami to help Bryant. She made the following statements during the campaign: \"As a mother, I know that homosexuals cannot biologically reproduce children; therefore, they must recruit our children\" and \"If gays are granted rights, next we'll have to give rights to prostitutes and to people who sleep with St. Bernards and to nail biters.\"[17] She also said, \"All America and all the world will hear what the people have said, and with God's continued help we will prevail in our fight to repeal similar laws throughout the nation.\"[15][19][20][21] The name of the campaign had to be changed to \"Protect America's Children\" because of legal action by the Save the Children foundation.[22][11] On June 7, 1977, Bryant's campaign led to a repeal of the anti-discrimination ordinance by a margin of 69 to 31 percent. However, the success of Bryant's campaign galvanized her opponents, and the gay community retaliated against her by forming the Coalition for Human Rights and the Miami Victory Campaign, who organized a boycott of orange juice.[17][11] Gay bars all over North America stopped serving screwdrivers[23] and replaced them with the \"Anita Bryant Cocktail\", which was made with vodka and apple juice.[24] Additionally, merchandise such as buttons, bumper stickers, and T-shirts with slogans like \"A day without human rights is like a day without sunshine\" were sold to push the anti-discrimination movement further.[11] Sales and proceeds went to gay rights activists to help fund their fight against Bryant and her campaign.[24] In 1977, Florida legislators approved a measure prohibiting gay adoption.[17] The ban was overturned more than 30 years later when, on November 25, 2008, Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Cindy S. Lederman declared it unconstitutional.[25] On October 14, 1977, during a televised appearance in Des Moines, Iowa, she repeatedly said she \"loves homosexuals, but hates their sin\".[26] During this appearance, Bryant became one of the first people to be publicly \"pied\" as part of a political protest. She had a pie thrown at her by Thom L. Higgins (1950–1994).[27][28] Bryant quipped \"At least it's a fruit pie\",[29] making a pun on the derogatory slur of \"fruit\" for a gay man and a reference to her work as a sponsor for fruit companies.[3] While covered in pie after the assault, she began to pray to God to forgive the activist \"for his deviant lifestyle\" before bursting into tears as the cameras continued rolling.[3] Bryant's husband said that he would not retaliate, but followed the protesters outside and threw a pie at them.[24] By this time, gay activists ensured that the boycott on Florida orange juice had become more prominent and it was supported by many celebrities, including Jane Fonda[24][page needed], Paul Williams,[30] and Vincent Price (he joked in a television interview that Oscar Wilde's A Woman of No Importance referred to her).[31] Johnny Carson also made Bryant a regular target of ridicule in his nightly monologues.[32] In 1978, Bryant and Bob Green told the story of their campaign in the book At Any Cost.[17] The gay community continued to regard Bryant's name as synonymous with bigotry and homophobia.[24][33] But at the same time, her name became a call to action for gay rights activists, and motivated many to picket her events, host anti-Bryant protests across the country, and increase attendance in and frequency of pride marches.[11] Bryant led several more campaigns around the country to repeal local anti-discrimination ordinances, including campaigns in St. Paul, Minnesota; Wichita, Kansas; and Eugene, Oregon. In 1978, her success led to the Briggs Initiative in California, which would have made pro-gay statements regarding homosexual people or homosexuality by any public school employee cause for dismissal.[17] Grassroots liberal organizations, chiefly in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area, organized to defeat the initiative. Days before the election, the California Democratic Party opposed the proposed legislation. President Jimmy Carter, Governor Jerry Brown, former president Gerald Ford, and former governor Ronald Reagan—then planning a run for the presidency—all voiced opposition to the initiative, and it ultimately suffered a massive defeat at the polls.[24] In 1998, the Miami-Dade County Commission reinstated the ordinance protecting individuals from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, by a narrow 7–6 vote. In 2002, a ballot initiative to repeal the 1998 law, called Amendment 14, was voted down by 56 percent of the voters.[24] The Florida statute forbidding gay adoption was upheld in 2004 by a federal appellate court against a constitutional challenge but was overturned by a Miami-Dade circuit court in November 2008.[25] The fallout from Bryant's political activism hurt her business and entertainment career.[34] In February 1977, the Singer Corporation rescinded an offer to sponsor an upcoming weekly variety show because of the \"extensive national publicity arising from [Bryant's] controversial political activities.\"[35] In 1978, while a member of a Baptist church, she ran for vice president of the Southern Baptist Convention, but lost. Several leaders disagreed with how she rejected civil rights for gay people.[36] Bryant's marriage to Bob Green also failed at that time, and in 1980 she divorced him, citing emotional abuse and latent suicidal thoughts.[37] Green refused to accept this, saying that his fundamentalist religious beliefs did not recognize civil divorce and that she was still his wife \"in God's eyes\".[38] Some Christian fundamentalist audiences and venues shunned Bryant after her divorce. Because she was no longer invited to appear at their events, she lost a major source of income. The Florida Citrus Commission also allowed her contract to lapse after the divorce, stating that Bryant had \"worn out\" as a spokesperson.[39][40] Bryant rapidly became an object of ridicule, as her image shifted from being a model Christian spokeswoman to that of a self-righteous bigot. The decline of her reputation was aided by Tonight Show host Johnny Carson, and other talk-show hosts and comedians, as they mocked her and her actions to the greater public. This led to many of her endorsements being cancelled and sponsors to drop her from their labels as she seemed to be a liability.[11] With three of her four children, she moved from Miami to Selma, Alabama, and later to Atlanta, Georgia.[37] In a 1980 Ladies' Home Journal article she said, \"The church needs to wake up and find some way to cope with divorce and women's problems.\" She also expressed some sympathy for feminist aspirations, given her own experiences of emotional abuse within her previous marriage. Bryant also commented on her anti-gay views and said, \"I'm more inclined to say live and let live, just don't flaunt it or try to legalize it.\"[41] In a 2012 interview, her son Robert Green, Jr. said \"she would be putting a lot more energy into fighting gay rights if she still felt as strongly.\"[42] Bryant appeared in Michael Moore's 1989 documentary film Roger & Me, in which she is interviewed and travels to Flint, Michigan, as part of the effort to revitalize its devastated local economy.[43] Bryant married her second husband, Charlie Hobson Dry, in 1990.[37] The couple tried to reestablish her music career in a series of small venues, including Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, where they opened Anita Bryant's Music Mansion. The establishment combined Bryant's performances of her successful songs from early in her career with a \"lengthy segment in which she preached her Christian beliefs\". The venture was not successful and the Music Mansion, which had missed meeting payrolls at times, filed for bankruptcy in 2001 with Bryant and Dry leaving behind a series of unpaid employees and creditors.[34] Bryant also spent part of the 1990s in Branson, Missouri, where the state and federal governments both filed liens claiming more than $116,000 in unpaid taxes. Bryant and Dry had also filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Arkansas in 1997 after piling up bills from a failed Anita Bryant show in Eureka Springs; among the debts were more than $172,000 (equivalent to about $326,000 in 2023) in unpaid state and federal taxes.[34] In 1996, Bryant said she was happy to be out of show business.[44] In 2005, Bryant returned to Barnsdall to attend the town's 100th anniversary celebration and to have a street renamed in her honor. In 2006, she founded Anita Bryant Ministries International in Oklahoma City.[5] In 1960, Bryant married Bob Green (1931–2012), a Miami disc jockey, with whom she eventually raised four children: Robert Jr. (Bobby), Gloria, and twins Billy and Barbara. She divorced him in 1980, attracting allegations of hypocrisy from the Christian right, who cited the indissolubility of Christian marriage.[34][45][46] Bryant married her second husband, Charlie Hobson Dry, in 1990. She was a member of Victory Church in Warr Acres, Oklahoma, a nondenominational evangelical church.[4] They remained married until his death in April 2024, eight months before Bryant's death.[47] In 2021, Bryant's granddaughter, Sarah Green, came out publicly on an episode of Slate's One Year podcast series by announcing her pending marriage to a woman, although she was having difficulty deciding whether she should invite her grandmother to the ceremony.[48][49] Bryant died from cancer at her home in Edmond, Oklahoma, on December 16, 2024.[50][3] Bryant is a frequently portrayed character at drag shows across the United States.[51][52] Bryant's name has frequently been invoked as a prototypical example of opposition to LGBT rights. When Elton John was criticized for touring Russia in 1979, he responded: \"I wouldn't say I won't tour in America because I can't stand Anita Bryant\".[53] In his song \"Mañana\", Jimmy Buffett sings \"I hope Anita Bryant never ever does one of my songs\".[54] In 1978, David Allan Coe recorded the song \"Fuck Aneta Briant\" [sic] on his album Nothing Sacred.[55][56] California punk rock band Dead Kennedys referenced Bryant in their song \"Moral Majority\" from their 1981 EP In God We Trust, Inc.[57] In 1977, the Dutch levenslied singer Zangeres Zonder Naam wrote the protest song \"Luister Anita\" (\"Listen Up, Anita\") on the occasion of the protest night \"Miami Nightmare\", organized in the Amsterdam Concertgebouw. The nightly concert was intended to raise funds for an advertisement in Time, in which the Dutch nation was to call on the American people to protect the rights of minorities. In the song, Zangeres Zonder Naam compared Anita Bryant to Hitler and called on gays to fight for their rights. The song became an integral part of her repertoire and cemented her status as a cult figure among Dutch gays.[58] Steve Gerber, in his Howard the Duck for Marvel Comics, made an organization called the Sinister S.O.O.F.I. (Save Our Offspring from Indecency) who were led by Anita Bryant. Although it was not explicitly stated, even The New York Times called the implication \"transparent\".[59] Armistead Maupin, in his 1980 novel More Tales of the City, used Anita Bryant's \"Save Our Children\" campaign to prompt a principal character to come out of the closet.[60] Bryant was regularly lampooned on Saturday Night Live, sometimes with her politics as the target,[61][62] sometimes her reputation as a popular, traditional entertainer known for her commercials as the target,[63] and sometimes targeting a combination of the two.[64] Her name was also a frequent punchline on The Gong Show, such as the time host/producer Chuck Barris joked that Bryant was releasing a new Christmas album called Gay Tidings. Some references were less overtly political, but equally critical. In the film Airplane!, Leslie Nielsen's character, upon seeing a large number of passengers become violently ill, vomit, and have uncontrollable flatulence, remarked: \"I haven't seen anything like this since the Anita Bryant concert.\"[65][3] Other television shows that targeted her were Soap,[66] Designing Women,[67] and The Golden Girls.[68][69] She was also the target of mockery in the RiffTrax short Drugs Are Like That.[70] Bryant appears in archive footage as a principal antagonist in the 2008 American biographical film Milk, about the life of gay rights activist and politician Harvey Milk. She was also portrayed as the principal antagonist in the 2011 play, Anita Bryant Died for Your Sins.[71] In May 2013, producers announced plans for a biographical HBO film based on Bryant's life to star Uma Thurman, with a script from gay screenwriter Chad Hodge.[72][73][74] Long languishing in development, as of 2019, Ashley Judd and Neil Patrick Harris have been attached to the project.[75] Archive footage of Bryant appears in The Gospel of Eureka, a 2018 documentary about the lives of LGBT individuals and evangelical Christians in Eureka Springs, Arkansas.[76] She is also the subject of The Loneliest Girl in the World, a musical that premiered at Diversionary Theatre in San Diego in mid-2018.[77][78] Mark D. Jordan has written: \"Many of her public statements, including her books, were ghostwritten by others, and there is internal reason to conclude that the most political books were pasted together by several hands from various sources.\"[79] With Bob Green",

                "content": "Advertisement Supported by The former beauty queen and spokeswoman for Florida orange juice was an all-American entertainer before she began crusading against L.G.B.T.Q. rights. By Anita Gates Anita Bryant, the singer and former beauty queen who had a flourishing music career in the 1960s and ’70 but whose opposition to gay rights — she called homosexuality “an abomination” — virtually destroyed her career, died on Dec. 16 at her home in Edmond, Okla. She was 84. The cause was cancer, her son William Green said. The family placed a paid obituary in The Oklahoman, a newspaper in Oklahoma City, on Thursday. Ms. Bryant was just 18 when she won the Miss Oklahoma beauty title and was named second runner-up in the Miss America pageant. She promptly turned that success into a lucrative show business career. For almost two decades, she had a smooth run — entertaining troops on U.S.O. tours with Bob Hope, performing during Billy Graham’s evangelical tours and co-hosting nationally televised parades. She sang the national anthem at the Super Bowl and “The Battle Hymn of the Republic” at President Lyndon B. Johnson’s graveside. Most memorably, she represented the Florida Citrus Commission in a long campaign of television commercials, in which she sang “Come to the Florida Sunshine Tree” and offered the tagline: “Breakfast without orange juice is like a day without sunshine.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

                "title": "How Anita Bryant helped spawn Florida's LGBTQ culture war",
                "content": "Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time At a public hearing in Dade County, Florida, parents were enraged. The nation, they said, was in peril and children were at risk. A recent ordinance had granted gay people housing and employment protections, and that meant teachers couldn’t be fired because of their sexuality. Florida classrooms quickly became a battleground, and opponents of the ordinance said the state’s support of civil rights for homosexuals was infringing on their rights as parents. Action had to be taken, and a campaign to limit the legal rights of LGBTQ people — all in the name of protecting children — was enacted. A woman who spoke at this hearing said it was her right to control “the moral atmosphere in which my children grow up.” That woman was Anita Bryant, formerly Miss Oklahoma and a white, telegenic, Top 40 singer who was well known for her Florida orange juice commercials (“A day without orange juice is like a day without sunshine!” she’d say). Bryant spearheaded an anti-LGBTQ campaign of such impact that its echoes can be heard in today’s rhetoric. The year was 1977. Last month, nearly half a century after Bryant’s “Save Our Children” campaign, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the Parental Rights in Education bill, dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill by its opponents. The measure, which takes effect July 1, prohibits classroom instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity in “kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.” Similar bills are being considered in 19 other states, according to the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ think tank that has been tracking the bills. Advocates of Florida’s bill say its purpose is to allow parents to decide how and when LGBTQ topics are introduced to their children. Opponents say it hurts the very children advocates are trying to protect. Sam Ames, director of advocacy and government affairs at The Trevor Project, a queer youth advocacy group, said in a statement that the bill will “erase young LGBTQ students across Florida, forcing many back into the closet by policing their identity and silencing important discussions about the issues they face.” Historians say they’ve seen this before. “It’s a contemporary version on these older attempts to annul homosexuality,” said Lillian Faderman, author of “The Gay Revolution,” among other queer history titles. “In the present environment, you can’t go after homosexual teachers anymore,” Faderman said. “We have too many allies. And so Florida has found another way to do it by this ‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill, which doesn’t go after homosexual teachers precisely. But the idea is the same. That is, that homosexuality is a pariah status, and it shouldn’t be discussed in the public schools.” When Bryant began her campaign in 1977, she had four children, and often said she was speaking as a mother and a Christian. And while the villainization of LGBTQ people was not new, Bryant took the idea of protecting children and made it mainstream. Her campaign and the subsequent “Save Our Children” political coalition used the argument that “homosexuals cannot reproduce, so they must recruit. And to freshen their ranks, they must recruit the youth of America.” Bryant’s focus on the idea that LGBTQ people were threatening to children created a talking point that social conservatives were able to rally around and promote to their friends and neighbors. Bryant paired this with her Christian faith, telling Playboy magazine in 1978 that her position “was not taken out of homophobia, but out of love” for gay people. When a gay activist threw a pie in her face during a news conference, she immediately prayed for the man to be “delivered from his deviant lifestyle.” “Deviance” was part of Bryant’s core argument that homosexuality was evil and that LGBTQ people didn’t deserve rights. To award them nondiscrimination protection was to offer them a kind of special privilege. If we label homosexuality a civil rights issue, what is to stop “the murderer from shouting ‘murderer rights’”? Bryant wrote in her 1977 book, “The Anita Bryant Story: The Survival of Our Nation’s Families and the Threat of Militant Homosexuality.” Bryant’s work resulted in the repeal of the Dade County nondiscrimination ordinance, by a more than 2-to-1 margin, in a voter referendum. Its repeal caused a backlash in other states that had passed similar ordinances, and Bryant’s fame grew. She took her message across the country, and for the next three years was named “The Most Admired Woman in America” in Good Housekeeping’s annual poll. While Bryant fueled the idea that gays were harmful to children, the blueprint for this type of rhetoric had been laid nearly 20 years before, also in the state of Florida. The Florida Legislative Investigation Committee (commonly referred to as the Johns Committee, after Charley Johns, its first chairman) was established in 1956, and was born out of opposition to the desegregation of schools and the pursuit of “communists.” The committee first targeted the NAACP but was stopped by the Supreme Court. The committee then turned to investigating alleged communists in Florida schools, but was stopped by the American Association of University Professors. They needed a new target, and in the fall of 1958, the committee began to investigate — and eliminate — LGBTQ people from Florida schools. There was no court and no association to protect them. The committee was well-funded by taxpayer dollars. School principals and university presidents cooperated. “Charley Johns’s argument was that of, these homosexuals are perverting our youth because they’re teaching our youth in college, and high school, and elementary school, and we have to get rid of them so they won’t turn young people into homosexuals,” Faderman said. From 1958 to 1965, hundreds — if not thousands — of students and teachers were targeted, with many losing their livelihoods. Though the committee was deterred from its investigation into the NAACP, its roots in opposition to desegregation and its evolution from racist opposition to homophobic oppression is clear, historians say. “The Christian right really comes together on enforcing segregation in the 1960s. It’s about anti-Black racism; that’s largely where it starts. And they’ve hit on this idea that they’re protecting children and education,” said Hugh Ryan, a historian and author of “When Brooklyn Was Queer.” “They realize that this works, that this is the issue that will create a ‘political moral majority.’” By the time we get to Anita Bryant in 1977, Ryan said, “they’ve already realized that they can harness this political conservatism and attach it to religion by talking about the family.” Though the Dade County ordinance was repealed, opposition to the bill led to a kind of LGBTQ activism that had not been previously seen in South Florida. “The thing to remember is that Anita Bryant won that battle initially, but she did not win that war,” said the historian Julio Capó Jr., a native Floridian, who wrote “Welcome to Fairyland: Queer Miami Before 1940.” He said Bryant inadvertently spurred a mobilization and a movement. “It was transformative,” Capó said. “It got people to see themselves as a voting bloc. It got them to see that their very existence and their rights were very much under attack in a different way than we had seen in the decade prior.” The activism spread from Dade County and across the country, pushing against Bryant’s own “Christian crusade,” as she called it. In 1977, the co-executive directors of the National Gay Task Force wrote a thank you in The New York Times to Bryant and her Save Our Children organization, saying they were “doing the 20 million lesbians and gay men in America an enormous favor: They are focusing for the public the nature of the prejudice and discrimination we face.” Though Bryant did enjoy some additional years of fame, her anti-gay rhetoric ultimately caused her career prospects to plummet. Her booking agent dropped her, the Florida Citrus Commission stopped running her orange juice ads and she filed for bankruptcy — twice. The anti-discrimination ordinance she helped repeal in 1977 was restored in 1998. And today, even though state legislators continue to chip away at LGBTQ rights, same-sex marriage is legal across the country and federal law prohibits anti-LGBTQ discrimination in the workplace. Though the times have changed significantly since Bryant’s heyday in the late ‘70s, it appears her views have not. In 2021, Bryant’s granddaughter Sarah Green told Slate that she came out to her grandmother on her 21st birthday. Bryant reportedly responded by saying homosexuality isn’t real. “It’s very hard to argue with someone who thinks that an integral part of your identity is just an evil delusion,” Green said. Green, who clarified to them.us that she is bisexual, told Slate about her upcoming wedding to her fiancée, a woman, and said she wasn’t sure if her grandmother would be attending. “I just kind of feel bad for her,” Green added. “And I think as much as she hopes that I will figure things out and come back to God, I kind of hope that she’ll figure things out.” Bryant, now 82, no longer lives in Florida. She returned to her home state of Oklahoma and runs Anita Bryant Ministries International. Neither Bryant nor Green responded to requests for comment.

                "content": "By Chris Willman Senior Music Writer and Chief Music Critic Anita Bryant, a former beauty queen and pop singer of the 1960s whose career led her to become a spokesperson for Florida oranges in the early ’70s and an evangelical crusader against gay rights later in that decade, died Dec. 16 at age 84, her family announced Thursday. The family’s obituary for Anita Bryant Day, as she was known outside the public sphere, was published in her hometown newspaper, the Oklahoman, and said the singer-activist died at home last month in Edmond, Oklahoma, surrounded by family and friends. During her heyday as a public figure, Bryant was one of the most polarizing celebrities in America, vilified by much of the show business community for campaigning against what she viewed as a gay takeover of American culture, while being embraced as a hero by many religious conservatives. Popular on Variety Related Stories VIP+ Media M&A Mania Gotcha Reeling? Try Skepticism Charles Dolan Remembered: John Malone, Brian Roberts and More Pay Tribute to the Cable Trailblazer Prior to her taking those stands, she was best known for her appearances in commercials for Florida oranges that introduced the catchphrase “Breakfast without orange juice is like a day without sunshine” — and many parodies of that statement — into the popular lexicon. Those advertisements eclipsed her long-dormant career as a pop singer, even as she made a move into recording gospel music after easy-listening sounds fell out of fashion in the rock era. Bryant’s notable public appearances in her less controversial years included singing at both the Democratic and Republican conventions in 1968, being a staple of Bob Hope’s holiday tours for overseas troops for seven straight years, singing “The Battle Hymn of the Republic” at the 1971 Super Bowl, and providing that some anthem as a musical eulogy for President Lyndon Johnson at his 1973 funeral, after singing for him on several occasions. In 1977, Bryant began fronting a “Save Our Children” campaign aimed at repealing an ordinance in Miami-Dade County that prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The crusade was successful in getting the ordinance repealed that year by a popular vote. (It was not restored until 1998.) For the next three years, her activism against such regulations made her a poster girl for the religious right and the foremost public archenemy of the gay community and social liberals. Her statement that she “loves homosexuals, but hates their sin” became a sort of mantra for evangelicals — and a much-mocked meme among what would later be known as the LGBTQ community — for decades to come. In 1978, her views were further amplified by the national media when she was the subject of the monthly “Playboy Interview.” The magazine began by recapping the sudden turnaround in her image: “For her first 36 years, Anita Bryant was the stereotypic embodiment of the American dream; hers was a rags-to-riches saga in the best Horatio Alger tradition. … Her life was comfortable and distinctly uncontroversial. Last year, all that suddenly and dramatically changed; her halcyon routine perished in the flames of political warfare. When the Metropolitan Dade County Commission passed an ordinance that would, in effect, mandate that qualified homosexuals be hired as teachers in private and parochial schools, Bryant stepped forward to spearhead a drive to repeal it. The ensuing campaign was drawn along classic good-versus-evil lines. Bryant recruited a slew of religious leaders and conservative politicos under the banner of her ad hoc organization, Save Our Children. Her pitch was simple: Homosexuality is a sin, and if homosexuals were given carte blanche to glamorize their ‘deviate lifestyle’ in Miami-area classrooms, the American family would be destroyed and the American way of life would disappear. … Bryant had become a fixture on the American political scene.” In the Playboy interview, Bryant said that she had not thought much about homosexuality prior to the Florida legislation that prompted her ire. “I got involved only because they were asking for special privileges that violated the state law of Florida, not to mention God’s law. … God says the wages of sin are death, and one little sin brings on another. The homosexual act is just the beginning of the depravity. It then leads to–what’s the word?–sadomasochism. It just gets worse as it goes on. You go further and further down the drain and it just becomes so perverted and you get into alcohol and drugs and it’s so rotten that many homosexuals end up committing suicide. The worst thing is that these days, so many married men with children who don’t have a happy marriage are going into the homosexual bars for satisfaction–if they’re not careful, they’re going to get caught up in it totally.” Her activism extended well beyond Florida as her fame in that arena grew, and she advocated for California’s infamous Briggs Initiative, which looked to ban public school employees from making pro-gay statements, at the cost of their employment. Even former California governor Ronald Reagan joined liberals in opposing the initiative, and once it went down to a massive defeat among voters, Bryant’s influence waned. Her activism led to the end of any substantial career Bryant had beyond the conservative Christian community. With Bryant becoming a punchline for Johnny Carson, and counteractivists boycotting oranges and adopting catchphrases like “A day without human rights is like a day without sunshine,” the Florida Citrus Commission declined to renew her contract as its brand ambassador in 1980, after an 11-year run that had included co-hosting the Orange Bowl Parade telecast for nine years. Other endorsement deals also dried up, although she had a sort of last hurrah with a two-hour “Anita Bryant Spectacular” patriotic special in 1980, with Bob Hope and Pat Boone costarring. Bryant divorced her husband, Bob Green, also in 1980, despite his publicly contesting the split on religious grounds. Her support in the evangelical community dropped as a result, with some of her former supporters believing that her initiating a divorce was sinful. After a decade of being single, she married her second husband, Charlie Hobson Dry, a childhood sweetheart, in 1990. One of Bryant’s most curious public appearances came in 1989 when she was interviewed by Michael Moore for his “Roger & Me” documentary. “Cheer up, Flint, Michigan,” Bryant was seen as advising the economically depressed city, leading to further derision. Bryant represented Oklahoma in the Miss America pageant in 1958, becoming second-runner-up. Many people believed she won the contest, because she already had some notoriety in television and music at that point. “I already had a recording contract when I did Miss America, so people knew me,” she said in a 2008 interview. “It’s really funny because people still tell me they remember when I won Miss America.” Bryant’s biggest break came when one of Arthur Godfrey’s talent scouts discovered her and put her on his variety show when she was 16, with a series of appearances there leading to her record deal. She soon was appearing on other shows, from Ed Sullivan’s to “American Bandstand.” Commercials for Kraft, Coca-Cola and Holiday Inn followed. Her biggest charting song was “Paper Roses,” which reached No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1960. It was followed by one other top 10 song, “My Little Corner of the World.” She registered 14 singles on the chart between 1959 and 1964, recording for the Carlton and Columbia labels. As rock sounds took over, she was seen more often on TV variety shows than on pop radio. Bryant did not have any breakout albums, although a holiday album that became something of an easy listening perennial, “Do You Hear What I Hear?: Christmas With Anita Bryant,” peaked at No. 25 in 1967. In 1970, Bryan released her first album with Word, the prominent Christian label of the day, and released primarily religious material thereafter. She also wrote a series of books with and without her then-husband Bob for Fleming H. Revell, a Christian publisher, that were popular in religious bookstores throughout the ’70s. Her last album was released in 1985. She was nominated for three Grammys in the late ’60s and early ’70s, all for religious material, two in the since-renamed “best sacred performance” category and one for best inspirational performance. During her glory days as one of TV’s most sought-after advertising personalities, Bryan’s campaign for Florida oranges had such a positive effect, she was credited with orange juice sales climbing from 382 million gallons to 800 million-plus gallons during her 1969-80 tenure as pitchwoman. In the subsequent years when the gay rights controversies made her anathema to most mainstream television programmers and advertisers, she continued to enjoy name value among some older consumers who came to see her first in Branson, Missouri, where she and her second husband opened a theater in the early ’90s, and then Nashville, where she moved in 1998 to put on a live variety extravaganza. Bryant moved back to Oklahoma in 2002 to care for her ill mother, deciding to remain in the state thereafter because of its friendliness to her traditional religious values. Well out of the limelight, she worked on writing inspirational books and founding Anita Bryant Ministries International. Bryant was preceded in death by her husband, Charlie, and is survived by four children, two stepdaughters, and seven grandchildren and their spouses.

                "content": "Celebrities have lost homes but a social media post showing the Hollywood sign burning proved to be false. Los Angeles wildfires: California National Guard to assist fire crews Since Tuesday, wildfires have ravaged different neighbourhoods in California, especially around the Los Angeles area. The California wildfires have killed at least 10 people and destroyed some 10,000 homes and structures, local officials have said. Los Angeles is home to Hollywood, America’s entertainment hub, and to many Hollywood celebrities. Many of these celebrities lost their houses in the fires. The Sunset Fire, which broke out on Wednesday about 6pm (02:00 GMT), particularly affected Hollywood Hills. Its cause is under investigation, but it ravaged 17 hectares (42 acres) of land. By midday on Thursday, Mayor Karen Bass reported that the Sunset Fire was contained. Billy Crystal: The 76-year-old American comedian and star of the 1980s iconic movie, When Harry Met Sally, lost the home that he has owned since 1979 in Pacific Palisades. Crystal and his wife, Janice, expressed sadness over losing the house in which they had raised their children and grandchildren. He said in a statement to CNN on Wednesday: “We are heartbroken of course but with the love of our children and friends we will get through this.” Mel Gibson: The Mad Max star told NewsNation that his house had been destroyed while he was filming in Austin, Texas. He said: “It’s kind of devastating. It’s emotional. You know, you live there for a long time, and you had all your stuff. I’ve been relieved from the burden of my stuff, because it’s all in cinders.” Jeff Bridges: A spokesman for the veteran actor was quoted by The Hollywood Reporter saying his home in Malibu had been burned down in the Palisades Fire. Paris Hilton: The television personality and socialite’s Malibu beach mansion has burned down, also in the Palisades Fire. In posts on Instagram and X, Hilton wrote that she had watched the disaster unfold on live television. “The heartbreak is truly indescribable,” she wrote in an X post. I’m standing here in what used to be our home, and the heartbreak is truly indescribable.💔🥺 When I first saw the news, I was in complete shock—I couldn’t process it. But now, standing here and seeing it with my own eyes, it feels like my heart has shattered into a million… pic.twitter.com/mJcFjQVVX7 — Paris Hilton (@ParisHilton) January 10, 2025 Cary Elwes: The Princess Bride actor also announced that his family home had been destroyed. He told his Instagram followers: “Sadly, we did lose our home but we are grateful to have survived this truly devastating fire.” Mandy Moore: The This Is Us star told Instagram followers that her family had evacuated their home in Altadena before it was badly damaged in the Eaton Fire. “I love you, Altadena. Grateful for my family and pets getting out last night before it was too late… Honestly, I’m in shock and feeling numb for all so many have lost, including my family. My children’s school is gone. Our favorite restaurants, leveled.” Milo Ventimiglia: Another This Is Us star told CBS News that he and his pregnant wife, Jarah Mariano, had lost their Malibu home. He said: “I think there’s a kind of shock moment where you’re going, ‘Oh, this is real and this is happening,’ and then at a certain point, we just turn it off. It’s like, what good is it to continue watching, you know. We kind of accepted the loss.” Media outlets also reported that the homes of Leighton Meester, known for television show Gossip Girl and her husband, Adam Brody from The OC; Anthony Hopkins; John Goodman; Miles Teller from Top Gun Maverick; and Anna Faris from Scary Movie had also been damaged or destroyed by the fires. However, they have yet to publicly comment. The star of the Schitt’s Creek comedy series, Eugene Levy, who is also honorary mayor of the Palisades, was reported by local media as having lost his $3.9m property. His son, Dan Levy, posted: “Heartbroken for my family, my friends, and the people of LA affected by the catastrophic fires.” However, Eugene Levy himself has not confirmed the loss of his home. Other celebrities announced that they have evacuated their homes. This includes model Chrissy Teigen and her husband, John Legend; James Woods; comedian Marc Maron; and actor Mark Hamill from Star Wars. With firefighting resources running thin, residents in the close-knit suburb of Altadena are concerned that the resources will be allocated to neighbourhoods where A-listers reside, Reuters reported. “You’re going to have some folks who are not going to get as much as they deserve, and some folks who may get more than actually they need,” Inez Moore, a lecturer at California State University told Reuters. Moore’s family home in Altadena was destroyed in the Eaton Fire. Social media users have been sharing images of what looks like the iconic Hollywood sign engulfed in flames. The sign is located in Griffith Park, which has been closed as a safety measure. However, from what we know so far, the sign is secure and has not caught fire. Jeff Zarrinnam, chair of the Hollywood Sign Trust, told Reuters news agency via email on Thursday that the sign had not been affected. Reuters reported that the images had likely been generated by AI software. Follow Al Jazeera English:",

By Carly Thomas Associate Editor As wildfires continue to ravage areas of Los Angeles, thousands have tragically lost their homes, including several Hollywood stars. The fire started Tuesday in Pacific Palisades, before spreading to parts of Malibu and Santa Monica overnight. As of early Thursday, the L.A. Fire Department said the Palisades Fire was zero percent contained. Two other active wildfires in the L.A. area — the Eaton and Woodley fires — are also at zero percent containment. The Lidia fire is 40 percent contained, and the Hurst fire is 10 percent contained, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Related Stories News Eaton Fire Puts L.A.

The house I worked in blood, sweat and tears for” is now gone. “This is the house where I found peace after battling with racist neighbors and a community that made me have to buy it in a trust within a trust so no one would know that widowed, single Black woman with a teenager was buying on the exclusively-held beach. This was my EFF YOU I’m here house,” she wrote. “This is an unimaginable loss. I grieve with the rest of Los Angeles as it burns… and even though I’ve found even words to write here, there’s nothing that I could say in this moment to describe this feeling.” Faris’ home was burned down in the Palisades Fire, The Hollywood Reporter confirmed on Wednesday. “Anna and her family are safe and grateful,” the Scary Movie star’s rep shared. Warren shared that the beach house she’s had for 30 years has been lost in the devastating wildfires. “This is the last pic I took of Leah’s rock from my beach house. I’ve had this house for almost 30 years. It looks like it was lost in the fire last nite,” she wrote on Instagram. “There’s a rainbow shining on it which I’m taking as a sign of hope for all creatures who have been affected by this tragedy.” Beyoncé’s mom Tina Knowles shared on Instagram Thursday that her “little bungalow on the water in Malibu” was destroyed. “It was my favorite place, my sanctuary , my sacred Happy Place,” she wrote in part. “Now it is gone !!

This could have been so much worse with out the dedication of the disaster workers and first responders. I’m so sad for the people who lost the five family members. My deepest Prayers are with you.” Pratt’s sister Stephanie posted a photo of Spencer with fire in the background on Instagram, sharing: “I am beyond heartbroken for my brother, Heidi & the kids. And to all of our friends and neighbors who have lost their houses today.” The Pratt siblings’ parents also lost their home. Woods CNN on Wednesday that his entire street was burning down. “There was so much chaos, it was like an inferno. Every house was on fire around us,” he said of fleeing his home. “We were evacuated with the clothes on our back.” Elwes shared in an update on Wednesday that he and his family were safe, but that their home had been destroyed. “Sadly, we did lose our home but we are grateful to have survived this truly devastating fire,” the Princess Bride star wrote on Instagram. “Our hearts go out to all the families impacted by this tragic event and we also with to extend our gratitude to all the firefighters, first responders and law enforcement who worked so tirelessly through the night and are still at it.” TV host and actress Lake revealed on Instagram Wednesday that she “lost our dream home” in the Palisades fire. “It’s all gone.

This description ‘dream home’ doesn’t suffice. It was our heaven on earth. The place where we planned to grow old together. We never took our heavenly spot on the bluff overlooking our beloved malibu for granted, not even for one second. I shared our sunset views almost daily with all of you. This loss is immeasurable.” Candy Spelling’s Maliby house was also destroyed in the fires. Spelling, mother to Tori Spelling and her brother, Randy, owned the house with her last husband, TV producer Aaron Spelling, for 50 years. “I’m in shock and processing this massive loss for our family,” Spelling told TMZ. “I am beyond grateful for the memories. It was truly a wonderful gift to have.” General Hospital actor Mathison shared a video on his social media of the devastation left behind by the fire, revealing that his house had burned down: “We are safe But this is what’s left of our beautiful home.

        "Carson Beck": [
            {
                "title": "Carson Beck's high-profile lifestyle makes him an easy scapegoat, but Georgia's issues ran deeper than QB - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Carson Beck did something unusual when he got to Georgia in 2020 -- he waited. When an inconsistent walk-on named Stetson Bennett IV won the starting job, he waited. When Bennett unexpectedly opted to come back for another year of eligibility, he waited. When NIL deals and the transfer portal beckoned, he waited. Beck was ranked as the No. 13 quarterback in the Class of 2020. Eight of the 12 players ranked ahead of him transferred out of their programs before Beck took over as the full-time starter. Two switched positions to get on the field. The others? Bryce Young and CJ Stroud. Quarterbacks simply don't wait their turn anymore, but Beck did. He did everything right. He did right by Georgia. After five years on campus and two years as the starter, Beck is set to enter the transfer portal. He initially declared for the NFL Draft, but was lured back to the college game. Miami seems like a reasonable destination, though Beck is expected to go through a full process. The Bulldogs lost three games for the first time since 2018. According to CBS Sports, Georgia was miffed by the way Beck handled himself after suffering a season-ending elbow injury, spending time away from the team while consulting outside medical opinions. The program was only given short notice before he opted to enter the portal. He arrived in New Orleans after the rest of the team. In the offseason, Beck made headlines after buying an expensive Lamborghini Urus Performante and for dating TikToker and Miami women's basketball player Hanna Cavinder. It seems the trappings of his fame became a distraction, either for Beck or within Georgia's locker room. Beck's excess seems to be at the root of much of the fan frustration in the wake of his exit. Maybe something did change for Beck with the newfound money and profile. Or maybe they just became a convenient way to scapegoat him for larger shortcomings at Georgia. Beck took over the starting quarterback job at Georgia fresh off two national championships. His predecessor, Bennett, will go down as perhaps the most beloved 'Dawg in program history after playing his way from walk-on to Heisman finalist. Still, there was optimism that Beck could bring something different to the passing game as a serious NFL prospect, even after offensive coordinator Todd Monken left for the NFL. (Monken went on to lead one of the most potent offenses in the NFL with the Baltimore Ravens after leaving Georgia. Bulldogs coach Kirby Smart replaced him with retread Mike Bobo. Keep an eye on that trend). In Beck's first season, he delivered nearly 4,000 yards and a 13-1 record. The passing offense took a step forward in both production and efficiency. If not for a monster showing by quarterback by Alabama's Jalen Milroe in the SEC Championship Game, the Bulldogs very well could have won another national championship. Top target Brock Bowers was selected in the first round. Receiver Ladd McConkey went in the second round. Both posted 1,000-yard seasons as rookies in the NFL, ranking among only four rookies to hit the mark. There were supposed successors to the players on the roster, but none stepped up. Even after last season, Beck could have declared for the NFL Draft and would have had a decent shot of being selected in the first round. Of course, he was assuredly compensated well to come back, but he was as committed to Georgia as any player that has come through the program in recent seasons. \"Coming back and trying to win a championship with these guys and this team is so important to me,\" Beck said last year. \"I know that's so cliche and that's what I'm supposed to say, but I truly believe that.\" Without his top weapons, Beck's second year was worse, clearly. His completion percentage fell from 72% to 64%, his yards per attempt dropped from 9.5 to 7.8 and his interceptions doubled from six to 12. Georgia lost multiple regular season games for the first time since 2020. While the Bulldogs ultimately won the SEC, it came after Beck suffered an elbow injury. Without Beck in the lineup, Georgia's season ended with a 23-10 loss against Notre Dame, matching the program's worst scoring output since 2015. To be clear, Georgia is well within its right to be ready to move on from Beck after two solid seasons. Backup Gunner Stockton, a more inexpensive roster commodity than Beck, surely, showed some real fight during a 23-10 loss to Notre Dame in the Sugar Bowl. Some of the same issues showed up again too, most notably a running game that averaged 2.1 yards per carry and a receiver room that dropped multiple passes. Regardless of whether Beck is a problem child or easy target, the atrophy at Georgia goes much deeper than QB1. Take a trip down memory lane for one moment. Out of 22 listed starters for Georgia on the 2021 national championship team, 21 have been drafted. The lone exception? Guard Tate Ratledge, who will be drafted in 2025 after a first team All-America season. More defensive players were drafted in the first round (6) than not (5). Among offensive skill talent, Bowers, McConkey, James Cook and Adonai Mitchell, who finished his career at Texas, were picked in the first two rounds. Jermaine Burton (a transfer to Alabama after the game) was picked in the third, and Zamir White in the fourth. Perhaps the greatest sin of the expectations at Georgia is we still don't appreciate just how ridiculously talented the two national championship teams were. Georgia was playing with an NFL receiver corps for three seasons. In 2024, Georgia's offense had nothing of the sort. Tight end Oscar Delp was the only pass-catcher ranked even in the top 150 of the CBS Sports NFL Draft Prospects. There's no serious NFL prospects at receiver. Georgia dropped 5.6% of Beck's passes in 2023. That jumped to 9.4% in 2024. Its pass-catching corps led the nation in drops. According to football analyst Clark Brooks, Beck had 665 drop yards -- meaning Beck would've thrown for 665 more yards had his receivers not dropped their passes. That is the highest drop-yard total in the time that Brooks has been keeping the statistic. Running backs Nate Frazier and Trevor Etienne are solid pieces, but the rushing offense ranked No. 102 nationally, a disastrous slotting. And furthermore, the run game schemes are borderline archaic, especially compared to the diversity that Georgia Tech brought to the table during the eight-overtime game. Beck is not a perfect quarterback. He turned the ball over far too much. His pressure-to-sack rate jumped dramatically in his second season, a sign that he didn't handle pressure well. Even with a lackluster receiver group, Beck didn't always elevate the unit. Because of that, he's smart to consider another year of college football to grow as a player, especially as he rehabs his elbow injury over the spring. And while Beck has not identified a destination, the beaches of Coral Gables will call. Miami helped turn middling draft prospect Cam Ward into a Heisman Trophy candidate and potential No. 1 overall NFL Draft pick after playing in a quarterback-friendly offense filled with talent. Beck has the skill set to similarly thrive with the Hurricanes. Georgia has not yet looked to the transfer portal, so Stockton will be the early favorite to start at quarterback next season. Third-string Jaden Rashada entered the transfer portal in search of his third school in three years, a perfect contrast to Beck's stability. For the past four years, Georgia has continued to bring in elite talent and churn out success. Smart's program has won 53 games over the past four seasons, including three straight undefeated SEC records. Talented players will line up to replace Beck, if the Bulldogs choose to court them. But for five years, Beck did everything right at the University of Georgia. He gave the program more than enough to win. Even on the most talent-filled roster in college football, there's little guarantee that better is on the horizon.

                "content": "Editions: En/ncaa This has come as something unexpected to everyone After a devastating injury to end his season in the SEC Championship game, now Georgia Bulldogs quarterback Carson Beck has announced his intention to enter the college football transfer portal, despite having already declared for the 2025 NFL Draft. Beck. He still has one season of college eligibility left, but is looking to explore his options and potentially play another year at the collegiate level. Beck's time at Georgia has been marked by a rollercoaster of achievements and challenges. Taking over as the starting quarterback in 2023, Beck led the Bulldogs to an impressive 12-0 regular-season record. However, his performance in 2024 was more inconsistent, with turnovers becoming a notable issue. Last season, he threw for 3,485 yards, 28 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions. An injury in the SEC Championship Game, which required UCL surgery, added another layer of complexity to his draft prospects and his future was already in jeopardy with the Dawgs. Related: After initially deciding to enter the NFL Draft, Carson Beck received feedback suggesting he might be selected anywhere between the first and third rounds. This uncertainty, combined with his injury concerns, prompted Beck to reconsider and explore the transfer portal. This move allows him the opportunity to address any lingering questions about his health and prove himself further in the college football arena. Miami has emerged as a potential landing spot for Beck, given his ties to Jacksonville, Florida, and his relationship with Miami women's basketball player Hanna Cavinder. A final season of eligibility at Miami could offer Beck the chance to regain his form and boost his draft stock. As Beck embarks on this new chapter, the college football community watches closely to see where he will land and how he will perform in his final year of eligibility. His decision could have significant implications for both his career and the teams involved. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved. Follow us",

He previously played for the Georgia Bulldogs, where he was part of two national championships as a backup in 2021 and 2022. Beck was born on November 19, 2002, in Jacksonville, Florida.[1] He attended Mandarin High School and was named the 2018 Florida Mr. Football after throwing for 3,546 yards and 30 touchdowns as a junior.[2][3] Beck led Mandarin to a Florida State Championship, throwing for five touchdowns in the championship game.[4] As a senior, he recorded 1,843 yards and 20 touchdowns on 278 completions.[2] As a sophomore he committed to play baseball at Florida, before deciding to focus on football, committing to Alabama for the sport.[5] Beck would ultimately decommit from Alabama and commit to play college football at the University of Georgia.[6] As a freshman, Beck entered the season as the backup in a quarterback room including Stetson Bennett, JT Daniels, and D'Wan Mathis. Beck made his first appearance against Missouri in the fourth quarter. The following season, Beck threw his first career touchdown pass in a 56–7 victory over UAB.[7] Beck played in three games, throwing for 176 yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions.[8] Beck entered the 2022 season as the second-string quarterback, serving as the backup for Bennett.

                "content": "Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama[1] (née Robinson; born January 17, 1964) is an American attorney and author who served as the first lady of the United States from 2009 to 2017, being married to Barack Obama, the 44th president of the United States. Raised on the South Side of Chicago, Obama is a graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Law School. In her early legal career, she worked at the law firm Sidley Austin where she met her future husband. She subsequently worked in nonprofits and as the associate dean of Student Services at the University of Chicago. Later, she served as vice president for community and external affairs of the University of Chicago Medical Center. Michelle married Barack in 1992, and they have two daughters. Obama campaigned for her husband's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. She was the first African-American woman to serve as first lady. As first lady, Obama worked as an advocate for poverty awareness, education, nutrition, physical activity, and healthy eating. She has written three books including her The New York Times best selling memoir Becoming (2018) and The Light We Carry (2022). Michelle LaVaughn Robinson was born on January 17, 1964, in Chicago, Illinois, to Fraser Robinson III (1935–1991),[2] a city water plant employee and Democratic precinct captain, and Marian Shields Robinson (1937–2024), a secretary at Spiegel's catalog store.[3] Her mother was a full-time homemaker until Michelle entered high school.[4] The Robinson and Shields families trace their roots to pre-Civil War African Americans in the American South.[2] On her father's side, she is descended from the Gullah people of South Carolina's Lowcountry region.[5] Her paternal great-great-grandfather, Jim Robinson, was born into slavery in 1850 on Friendfield Plantation, near Georgetown, South Carolina.[6][7] He became a freedman at age 15 after the war. Some of Obama's paternal family still reside in the Georgetown area.[8][9] Her grandfather, Fraser Robinson Jr., built his own house in South Carolina. He and his wife LaVaughn (née Johnson) returned to the Lowcountry from Chicago after retirement.[6] Among her maternal ancestors was her great-great-great-grandmother, Melvinia Dosey Shields,[10] born into slavery in South Carolina but sold to Henry Walls Shields, who had a 200-acre farm in Clayton County, Georgia, near Atlanta. Melvinia's first son, Adolphus T. Shields, was biracial and born into slavery around 1860. Based on DNA and other evidence, in 2012, researchers said his father was likely 20-year-old Charles Marion Shields, son of Melvinia's master. They may have had a continuing relationship, as she had two more mixed-race children and lived near Shields after emancipation, taking his surname (she later changed her surname).[11] As was often the case, Melvinia did not talk to relatives about Dolphus's father.[12] Dolphus Shields, with his wife Alice, moved to Birmingham, Alabama, after the Civil War. They were great-great-grandparents of Robinson, whose grandparents had moved to Chicago.[12] Other of their children's lines migrated to Cleveland, Ohio, in the 20th century.[11] All four of Robinson's grandparents had multiracial ancestors, reflecting the complex history of the United States. Her extended family has said that people did not talk about the era of slavery when they were growing up.[11] Her distant ancestry includes Irish, English, and Native American roots.[13] Among her contemporary extended family is Rabbi Capers Funnye, her first cousin once removed born in Georgetown, South Carolina. Funnye is the son of her paternal grandfather's sister and her husband, and he is about 12 years older than Michelle. He converted to Judaism after college.[14][15] Robinson's childhood home was on the upper floor of 7436 South Euclid Avenue in Chicago's South Shore community area, which her parents rented from her great-aunt, who had the first floor.[3][16][17][18] She was raised in what she describes as a \"conventional\" home, with \"the mother at home, the father works, you have dinner around the table\".[19] Her elementary school was down the street. She and her family enjoyed playing games such as Monopoly, reading, and frequently saw extended family on both sides.[20] She played piano,[21] learning from her great-aunt, who was a piano teacher.[22] The Robinsons attended services at nearby South Shore United Methodist Church.[16] They used to vacation in a rustic cabin in White Cloud, Michigan.[16] She and her 21-month-older brother, Craig, skipped the second grade.[3][23] Robinson's father suffered from multiple sclerosis, which had a profound effect on her. Subsequently, she was determined to stay out of trouble and perform well in school.[24] By sixth grade, Michelle joined a gifted class at Bryn Mawr Elementary School (later renamed Bouchet Academy).[25] She attended Whitney Young High School,[26] Chicago's first magnet high school, established as a selective enrollment school, where she was a classmate of Jesse Jackson's daughter Santita.[20] The round-trip commute from the Robinsons' South Side home to the Near West Side, where the school was located, took three hours.[27] Michelle recalled being fearful of how others would perceive her, but disregarded any negativity around her and used it \"to fuel me, to keep me going\".[28][29] She recalled facing gender discrimination growing up, saying, for example, that rather than asking her for her opinion on a given subject, people commonly tended to ask what her older brother thought.[30] She was on the honor roll for four years, took advanced placement classes, was a member of the National Honor Society, and served as student council treasurer.[3] She graduated in 1981 as the salutatorian of her class.[27] Robinson was inspired to follow her brother to Princeton University, which she entered in 1981.[31][4] She majored in sociology and minored in African-American studies, graduating cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in 1985 after completing a 99-page senior thesis titled Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community under the supervision of Walter Wallace.[32][3][33] Robinson recalls that some of her teachers in high school tried to dissuade her from applying, and that she had been warned against \"setting my sights too high\".[34][35] She believed her brother's status as a student in good standing (he graduated in 1983) might have helped her during the admission process,[36] but she was resolved to demonstrate her own worth.[37] She has said she was overwhelmed during her first year, attributing this to the fact that neither of her parents had graduated from college,[38] and that she had never spent time on a college campus.[39] The mother of a white roommate reportedly tried to get her daughter reassigned because of Michelle's race.[31] Robinson said being at Princeton was the first time she became more aware of her ethnicity and, despite the willingness of her classmates and teachers to reach out to her, she still felt \"like a visitor on campus\".[40][41] There were also issues of economic class. \"I remember being shocked,\" she says, \"by college students who drove BMWs. I didn't even know parents who drove BMWs.\"[27] While at Princeton, Robinson became involved with the Third World Center (now known as the Carl A. Fields Center), an academic and cultural group who supported minority students. She ran their daycare center, which also offered after-school tutoring for older children.[42] She challenged the teaching methodology for French because she felt it should be more conversational.[43] As part of her requirements for graduation, she wrote a sociology thesis, entitled Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community.[44][45] She researched her thesis by sending a questionnaire to African-American graduates, asking that they specify when and how comfortable they were with their race prior to their enrollment at Princeton and how they felt about it when they were a student and since then. Of the 400 alumni to whom she sent the survey, fewer than 90 responded. Her findings did not support her hope that the black alumni would still identify with the African-American community, even though they had attended an elite university and had the advantages that accrue to its graduates.[46] Robinson pursued professional study, earning her Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from Harvard Law School in 1988.[47] By the time she applied for Harvard Law, biographer Bond wrote, her confidence had increased: \"This time around, there was no doubt in her mind that she had earned her place\".[46] Her faculty mentor at Harvard Law was Charles Ogletree, who has said she had answered the question that had plagued her throughout Princeton by the time she arrived at Harvard Law: whether she would remain the product of her parents or keep the identity she had acquired at Princeton; she had concluded she could be \"both brilliant and black\".[48] At Harvard, Robinson participated in demonstrations advocating the hiring of professors who were members of minority groups.[49] She worked for the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, assisting low-income tenants with housing cases.[50] She is the third first lady with a postgraduate degree, after her two immediate predecessors, Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush.[51] She later said her education gave her opportunities beyond what she had ever imagined.[52] Michelle's mother, Marian Robinson, was a stay-at-home mother.[53] Her father was Fraser C. Robinson III, who worked at the city's water purification plant.[53] Robinson's father, Fraser, died from complications from his illness in March 1991.[54] She would later say that although he was the \"hole in my heart\" and \"loss in my scar\", the memory of her father has motivated her each day since.[39] Her friend Suzanne Alele died from cancer around this time as well. These losses made her think of her contributions toward society and how well she was influencing the world from her law firm in her first job after law school. She considered this a turning point.[55] Robinson met Barack Obama when they were among the few African Americans at their law firm, Sidley Austin LLP (she has sometimes said only two, although others have noted that there were others in different departments).[56] She was assigned to mentor him while he was a summer associate.[57] Their relationship started with a business lunch and then a community organization meeting where he first impressed her.[58] Before meeting Obama, Michelle had told her mother she intended to focus solely on her career.[59] The couple's first date was to Spike Lee's movie Do the Right Thing (1989).[60] Barack Obama has said the couple had an \"opposites attract\" scenario in their initial interest in each other since Michelle had stability from her two-parent home while he was \"adventurous\".[61] They married on October 3, 1992.[58] After suffering a miscarriage, Michelle underwent in vitro fertilisation[62] to conceive their daughters Malia Ann (born 1998) and Natasha (known as Sasha, born 2001).[63] The Obama family lived on Chicago's South Side, where Barack taught at the University of Chicago Law School. He was elected to the state senate in 1996 and to the U.S. Senate in 2004. They chose to keep their residence in Chicago after Barack's election rather than to move to Washington, DC, as they felt it was better for their daughters. Throughout her husband's 2008 campaign for U.S. president, Obama made a \"commitment to be away overnight only once a week – to campaign only two days a week and be home by the end of the second day\" for their two daughters.[64] She once requested that her then-fiancé meet her prospective boss, Valerie Jarrett, when considering her first career move;[19] Jarrett became one of her husband's closest advisors.[65][66] The marital relationship has had its ebbs and flows; the combination of an evolving family life and beginning political career led to many arguments about balancing work and family. Barack Obama wrote in his second book, The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream, that \"Tired and stressed, we had little time for conversation, much less romance.\"[67] Despite their family obligations and careers, they continued to try to schedule \"date nights\" while they lived in Chicago.[68] The Obamas' daughters attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, a private school.[69] As a member of the school's board, Michelle fought to maintain diversity in the school when other board members connected with the University of Chicago tried to reserve more slots for children of the university faculty. This resulted in a plan to expand the school to increase enrollment.[4] In Washington, DC, Malia and Sasha attended Sidwell Friends School, after also considering Georgetown Day School.[70][71] In 2008, Michelle said in an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that they did not intend to have any more children.[72] The Obamas received advice from past first ladies Laura Bush, Rosalynn Carter, and Hillary Clinton about raising children in the White House.[71] Marian Robinson, Michelle's mother, moved in to the White House to assist with child care.[73] Obama was raised United Methodist and joined the Trinity United Church of Christ, a mostly black congregation of the Reformed denomination known as the United Church of Christ. She and Barack Obama were married there by Rev. Jeremiah Wright. On May 31, 2008, Barack and Michelle Obama announced that they had withdrawn their membership in Trinity United Church of Christ saying: \"Our relations with Trinity have been strained by the divisive statements of Reverend Wright, which sharply conflict with our own views.\"[74] The Obama family attended several different Protestant churches after moving to Washington D.C. in 2009, including Shiloh Baptist Church and St. John's Episcopal Church on Lafayette Square, known as the Presidents' Church. At the 49th African Methodist Episcopal Church's general conference, Michelle Obama encouraged the attendees to advocate for political awareness, saying, \"To anyone who says that church is no place to talk about these issues, you tell them there is no place better – no place better, because ultimately, these are not just political issues – they are moral issues, they're issues that have to do with human dignity and human potential, and the future we want for our kids and our grandkids.\"[75] Following law school, Obama became an associate at the Chicago office of the law firm Sidley & Austin, where she met her future husband Barack. At the firm, she worked on marketing and intellectual property law.[3] She continues to hold her law license, but as she no longer needs it for her work, she has kept it on a voluntary inactive status since 1993.[76][77] In 1991, she held public sector positions in the Chicago city government as an assistant to the mayor and as the assistant commissioner of planning and development. In 1993, she became executive director for the Chicago office of Public Allies, a non-profit organization encouraging young people to work on social issues in nonprofit groups and government agencies.[26] She worked there nearly four years and set fundraising records for the organization that stood twelve years after she had left.[20] Obama later said she had never been happier in her life prior to working \"to build Public Allies\".[78] In 1996, Obama served as the associate dean of student services at the University of Chicago, where she developed the university's Community Service Center.[79] In 2002, she began working for the University of Chicago Hospitals, first as executive director for community affairs and, beginning May 2005, as vice president for community and external affairs.[80] She continued to hold the University of Chicago Hospitals position during the primary campaign of 2008 but cut back to part-time in order to spend time with her daughters as well as work for her husband's election.[81] She subsequently took a leave of absence from her job.[82] According to the couple's 2006 income tax return, her salary was $273,618 from the University of Chicago Hospitals, while her husband had a salary of $157,082 from the United States Senate. The Obamas' total income was $991,296, which included $51,200 that she earned as a member of the board of directors of TreeHouse Foods and investments and royalties from his books.[83] Obama served as a salaried board member of TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (NYSE: THS),[84] a major Wal-Mart supplier from shortly after her husband was seated in the Senate until she cut ties shortly after her husband announced his candidacy for the presidency; he criticized Wal-Mart labor policies at an AFL–CIO forum in Trenton, New Jersey, on May 14, 2007.[85] She also served on the board of directors of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.[86] In 2021, the former first lady announced that she has been \"moving toward retirement\".[87] Though she continues to be active in political campaigns, the former first lady has said she is reducing the amount of work to spend more time with her husband.[87] During an interview in 1996, Michelle Obama acknowledged there was a \"strong possibility\" her husband would begin a political career, but said she was \"wary\" of the process. She knew it meant their lives would be subject to scrutiny and she was intensely private.[88] Although she campaigned on her husband's behalf since early in his political career by handshaking and fund-raising, she did not relish the activity at first. When she campaigned during her husband's 2000 run for United States House of Representatives, her boss at the University of Chicago asked if there was any single thing about campaigning that she enjoyed; after some thought, she replied that visiting so many living rooms had given her some new decorating ideas.[89][90] Obama opposed her husband's run for the congressional seat, and, after his defeat, she preferred he tend to the financial needs of the family in what she deemed a more practical way.[91] At first, Obama had reservations about her husband's presidential campaign, due to fears about a possible negative effect on their daughters.[92] She says that she negotiated an agreement in which her husband was to quit smoking in exchange for her support of his decision to run.[93] About her role in her husband's presidential campaign, she has said: \"My job is not a senior adviser\".[65][94][95] During the campaign, she discussed race and education by using motherhood as a framework.[43] In May 2007, three months after her husband declared his presidential candidacy, Obama reduced her professional responsibilities by 80 percent to support his presidential campaign.[19] Early in the campaign, she had limited involvement, traveling to political events only two days a week and rarely traveling overnight;[96] by early February 2008, her participation had increased significantly. She attended thirty-three events in eight days.[66] She made several campaign appearances with Oprah Winfrey.[97][98] She wrote her own stump speeches for her husband's presidential campaign and generally spoke without notes.[27] During the campaign, columnist Cal Thomas on Fox News described Michelle Obama as an \"Angry Black Woman\"[99][100][101] and some websites attempted to promote this image.[102] Obama said: \"Barack and I have been in the public eye for many years now, and we've developed a thick skin along the way. When you're out campaigning, there will always be criticism. I just take it in stride, and at the end of the day, I know that it comes with the territory.\"[103] By the time of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in August, media outlets observed that her presence on the campaign trail had grown softer than at the start of the race, focusing on soliciting concerns and empathizing with the audience rather than throwing down challenges to them, and giving interviews to shows such as The View and publications like Ladies' Home Journal rather than appearing on news programs. The change was reflected in her fashion choices, as she wore clothes that were more informal clothes than her earlier designer pieces.[89] Partly intended to help soften her public image,[99] her appearance on The View was widely covered in the press.[104] The presidential campaign was Obama's first exposure to the national political scene; she was considered the least famous of the candidates' spouses.[94] Early in the campaign, she told anecdotes about Obama family life; however, as the press began to emphasize her sarcasm, she toned it down.[83][93] New York Times op-ed columnist Maureen Dowd wrote: I wince a bit when Michelle Obama chides her husband as a mere mortal – a comic routine that rests on the presumption that we see him as a god ... But it may not be smart politics to mock him in a way that turns him from the glam JFK into the mundane Gerald Ford, toasting his own English muffin. If all Senator Obama is peddling is the Camelot mystique, why debunk this mystique?[94][105] On the first night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Craig Robinson introduced his younger sister.[106] She delivered her speech, during which she sought to portray herself and her family as the embodiment of the American Dream.[107] Obama said she and her husband believe \"that you work hard for what you want in life, that your word is your bond, and you do what you say you're going to do, that you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you don't know them, and even if you don't agree with them.\"[108] She also emphasized loving her country, likely responding to criticism for having said that she felt \"proud of her country for the first time\".[107][109][110] The first statement was seen as a gaffe.[111] Her keynote address was largely well-received and drew mostly positive reviews.[112] A Rasmussen Reports poll found that her favorability among Americans reached 55%, the highest for her.[113] On an October 6, 2008, broadcast, Larry King asked Obama if the American electorate was past the Bradley effect. She said her husband's winning the nomination was a fairly strong indicator that it was.[114] The same night she was interviewed by Jon Stewart on The Daily Show, where she deflected criticism of her husband and his campaign.[115] On Fox News' America's Pulse, E. D. Hill referred to the fist bump shared by the Obamas the night he clinched the Democratic presidential nomination, describing it as a \"terrorist fist jab\". Hill was taken off air, and the show was canceled.[116][117] Obama campaigned for her husband's re-election in 2012. Beginning in 2011, Obama became more politically active than she had been since the 2008 election, though avoided discussions about the re-election bid.[118] By the time of the election cycle, she had developed a more open public image.[119][120] Some commentators viewed her as the most popular member of the Obama administration,[121] noting that her poll approval numbers had not dropped below 60% since she entered the White House.[122] An Obama senior campaign official said she was \"the most popular political figure in America\".[123] The positive assessment was reasoned to have contributed to her active role in the re-election campaign, but it was noted that the challenge for the Obama campaign was to use her without tarnishing her popularity. Obama was considered a polarizing figure, having aroused both \"sharp enmity and deep loyalty\" from Americans, but she was also seen as having improved her image since 2008 when her husband first ran for the presidency.[121] Isabel Wilkinson of The Daily Beast said Obama's fashion style changed over the course of the campaign to be sensitive and economical.[124] Prior to the first debate of the election cycle, Obama expressed confidence in her husband's debating skills.[125] He was later criticized for appearing detached and for looking down when addressing Romney.[126][127] Consensus among uncommitted voters was that the latter had won the debate.[128] After Obama's speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, the first lady was found through a CBS News/New York Times poll conducted in September to have a 61% favorably rating with registered voters, the highest percentage she had polled since April 2009.[129] Obama aimed to humanize her husband by relating stories about him, attempting to appeal to female voters in swing states. Paul Harris of The Guardian said the same tactic was being used by Ann Romney, wife of 2012 Republican candidate Mitt Romney. Polls in October showed their husbands tied at 47% for the female vote. However, Michelle Obama's favorability ratings remained higher than Ann Romney's at 69% to 52%.[130] Despite Obama's higher poll numbers, comparisons between Obama and Romney were repeatedly made by the media until the election.[131][132] But, as Michelle Cottle of Newsweek wrote, \"... nobody votes for first lady.\"[133] During her early months as First Lady, Obama visited homeless shelters and soup kitchens.[134] She also sent representatives to schools and advocated public service.[134][135] Obama advocated for her husband's policy priorities by promoting bills that support it. She hosted a White House reception for women's rights advocates in celebration of the enactment of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 Pay equity law. She supported the economic stimulus bill in visits to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and United States Department of Education. Some observers looked favorably upon her legislative activities, while others said she should be less involved in politics. According to her representatives, she intended to visit all United States Cabinet-level agencies in order to get acquainted with Washington.[136] On June 5, 2009, the White House announced that Michelle Obama was replacing her then chief of staff, Jackie Norris, with Susan Sher, a longtime friend and adviser. Norris became a senior adviser to the Corporation for National and Community Service.[137] Another key aide, Spelman College alumna Kristen Jarvis, served from 2008 until 2015, when she left to become chief of staff to the Ford Foundation president Darren Walker. In 2009, Obama was named Barbara Walters's Most Fascinating Person of the year.[138] In her memoir, Becoming, Obama describes her four primary initiatives as first lady: Let's Move!, Reach Higher,[139] Let Girls Learn,[140] and Joining Forces.[141] Some initiatives of First Lady Michelle Obama included advocating on behalf of military families, helping working women balance career and family, encouraging national service, and promoting the arts and arts education.[142][143] Obama made supporting military families and spouses a personal mission and increasingly bonded with military families. According to her aides, stories of the sacrifice these families make moved her to tears.[143] In April 2012, Obama and her husband were awarded the Jerald Washington Memorial Founders' Award by the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans (NCHV). The award is the highest honor given to homeless veteran advocates.[144] Obama was again honored with the award in May 2015, accepting with Jill Biden.[145] In November 2013, a Politico article by Michelle Cottle accusing Obama of being a \"feminist nightmare\" for not using her position and education to advocate for women's issues was sharply criticized across the political spectrum.[146][147][148] Cottle quoted Linda Hirshman saying of Obama's trendy styles, promotion of gardening and healthy eating, and support of military families that \"She essentially became the English lady of the manor, Tory Party, circa 1830s.\"[146] A prominent critic of Cottle was MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry, who rhetorically asked \"Are you serious?\"[147][148] Supporters of Obama note that the first lady had been one of the only people in the administration to address obesity, through promoting good eating habits, which is one of the leading U.S. public health crises.[149] In May 2014, Obama joined the campaign to bring back school girls who had been kidnapped in Nigeria. The first lady tweeted a picture of herself holding a poster with the #bringbackourgirls campaign hashtag.[150] Obama writes in her book about enlisting help for her initiative Let Girls Learn to produce and sing the song \"This is for My Girls\".[151] Over the course of the Obama presidency, particularly during the second term, Michelle Obama was subject to speculation over whether she would run for the presidency herself, similarly to predecessor Hillary Clinton.[152] A May 2015 Rasmussen poll found Obama had 22% of support to Clinton's 56% of winning the Democratic nomination, higher than that of potential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Martin O'Malley, and Bernie Sanders.[153][154] Another poll that month found that 71% of Americans believed Obama should not run for the presidency, only 14% approving.[154] On January 14, 2016, during a town-hall meeting, President Obama was asked if the first lady could be talked into running. He responded, \"There are three things that are certain in life: death, taxes, and Michelle is not running for president. That I can tell you.\"[155][156] On March 16, 2016, while speaking in Austin, Texas, Obama denied that she would ever run for the office, citing a desire to \"impact as many people as possible in an unbiased way\".[157] In the epilogue to Becoming, Obama writes, \"I have no intention of running for office, ever,\"[158] recognizing that \"politics can be a means for positive change, but this arena is just not for me.\"[159] Obama's predecessors Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush supported the organic movement by instructing the White House kitchens to buy organic food. Obama extended their support of healthy eating by planting the White House Kitchen Garden, an organic garden, the first White House vegetable garden since Eleanor Roosevelt served as First Lady. She also had bee hives installed on the South Lawn of the White House. The garden supplied organic produce and honey for the meals of the First Family and for state dinners and other official gatherings.[160][161][162][163] In January 2010, Obama undertook her first lead role in an administration-wide initiative, which she named \"Let's Move!\", to make progress in reversing the 21st-century trend of childhood obesity.[162][164] On February 9, 2010, the first lady announced Let's Move! and President Barack Obama created the Task Force on Childhood Obesity to review all current programs and create a national plan for change.[165] Michelle Obama said her goal was to make this effort her legacy: \"I want to leave something behind that we can say, 'Because of this time that this person spent here, this thing has changed.' And my hope is that that's going to be in the area of childhood obesity.\"[162] Her 2012 book American Grown: The Story of the White House Kitchen Garden and Gardens Across America is based on her experiences with the garden and promotes healthy eating.[166] Her call for action on healthy eating was repeated by the United States Department of Defense, which has been facing an ever-expanding problem of obesity among recruits.[167] Several Republicans have critiqued or lampooned Obama's initiative. In October 2014, senator Rand Paul linked to Michelle Obama's Twitter account when announcing on the website that he was going to Dunkin' Donuts.[168] In January 2016, Chris Christie, Republican governor of New Jersey and presidential candidate, criticized the first lady's involvement with healthy eating while he was campaigning in Iowa, arguing that she was using the government to exercise her views on eating.[169][170] Obama had previously cited Christie as an example of an adult who struggled with obesity, a demographic that she sought to diminish by targeting children since Let's Move! was \"working with kids when they're young, so that they don't have these direct challenges when they get older.\"[171] In February, Senator Ted Cruz said that he would end Obama's health policies and return french fries to school cafeterias if his wife were first lady.[172] In the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign, Obama boasted to gay Democratic groups of her husband's record on LGBT rights: his support of the Illinois Human Rights Act, the Illinois gender violence act, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, repealing the \"Don't Ask Don't Tell\" policy, and full repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act, civil unions; along with hate crimes protection for sexual orientation and gender identity and renewed effort to fight HIV and AIDS. They have both opposed amendments proposed to ban same-sex marriage in the federal, California, and Florida constitutions. She said that the U.S. Supreme Court delivered justice in the Lawrence v. Texas case, and she drew a connection between the struggles for gay rights and civil rights by saying, \"We are all only here because of those who marched and bled and died, from Selma to Stonewall, in the pursuit of a more perfect union.\"[173][174][175] After the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell on September 20, 2011, Obama included openly gay service members in her national military families initiative.[176] On May 9, 2012, Barack and Michelle Obama came out publicly in favor of same-sex marriage. Prior to this, Michelle Obama had never publicly stated her position on this issue. Senior White House officials said Michelle Obama and Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett had been the two most consistent advocates for same-sex marriage in Barack Obama's life.[177] Michelle said: This is an important issue for millions of Americans, and for Barack and me, it really comes down to the values of fairness and equality we want to pass down to our girls. These are basic values that kids learn at a very young age and that we encourage them to apply in all areas of their lives. And in a country where we teach our children that everyone is equal under the law, discriminating against same-sex couples just isn't right. It's as simple as that.[178] At the 2012 DNC, Michelle said, \"Barack knows the American Dream because he's lived it ... and he wants everyone in this country to have that same opportunity, no matter who we are, or where we're from, or what we look like, or who we love.\"[179] In May 2009, Obama delivered the commencement speech at a graduating ceremony at UC Merced in Merced County, California, the address being praised afterward by students who found her relatable. Kevin Fagan of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that there was chemistry between Obama and the students.[180] In August 2013, Obama attended the 50th anniversary ceremony for the March on Washington at the Lincoln Memorial. Positive attention was brought to Obama's attire, a black sleeveless dress with red flowers, designed by Tracy Reese.[181][182] Reese reacted by releasing a public statement that she was honored the first lady \"would choose to wear one of our designs during the celebration of such a deeply significant historical moment\".[183][184] In March 2015, Obama traveled to Selma, Alabama, with her family to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery marches.[185] After President Obama's remarks there, the Obamas joined original marchers, including John Lewis, in crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge.[186][187] In July 2015, Obama journeyed to Coachella Valley while coming to Los Angeles for that year's Special Olympics World Games.[188] In October 2015, Obama was joined by Jill Biden and Prince Harry in visiting a military base in Fort Belvoir, Virginia, in an attempt on the prince's part to raise awareness to programs supporting harmed service members.[189] In December 2015, Obama traveled with her husband to San Bernardino, California, to meet with families of the victims of a terrorist attack that occurred two weeks earlier.[190] On April 1, 2009, Obama met with Queen Elizabeth II in Buckingham Palace. Obama embraced her before attending an event with world leaders.[191] Obama praised her, though the hug generated controversy for being out of protocol when greeting Elizabeth.[192][193] In April 2010, Obama traveled to Mexico, her first solo visit to a nation.[194] In Mexico, Obama spoke to students, encouraging them to take responsibility for their futures.[195][196] Referring to the underprivileged children, Obama argued that \"potential can be found in some of the most unlikely places,\" citing herself and her husband as examples.[197][198] Obama traveled to Africa for the second official trip in June 2011, touring Johannesburg, Cape Town and Botswana and meeting with Graça Machel. Obama was also involved with community events in the foreign countries.[199] It was commented by White House staff that her trip to Africa would advance the foreign policy of her husband.[200][201] In March 2014, Obama visited China along with her two daughters Malia and Sasha, and her mother Marian Robinson. She met with Peng Liyuan, the wife of Chinese president Xi Jinping, visited historic and cultural sites, as well as a university and two high schools.[202][203] Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said the visit and intent in Obama journeying there was to symbolize \"the relationship between the United States and China is not just between leaders, it's a relationship between peoples.\"[204][205] In January 2015, Obama traveled to Saudi Arabia alongside her husband, following the death of King Abdullah. She received criticism for not covering her head in a nation where women are forbidden from publicly not doing so,[206][207] though Obama was defended for being a foreigner and thus not having to submit to Saudi Arabia's customs,[208] even being praised in some corners.[209] Obama was neither greeted nor acknowledged by King Salman during the encounter.[210] In June 2015, Obama undertook a weeklong trip to London and three Italian cities. In London, she spoke with students about international education for adolescent girls and met with both British prime minister David Cameron and Prince Harry. She was joined by her two daughters and mother.[211] In November, she spent a week in Qatar, her first official visit to the Middle East. She continued advancing her initiative for international education for women by speaking at the 2015 World Innovation Summit for Education for her \"Let Girls Learn\" initiative in Doha, Qatar, and touring a school in Amman, Jordan, where she met with female students.[30][212][213] During the Qatar trip, Obama had intended to visit Jordan as well, but the trip was canceled due to weather conditions. In Jordan, Obama had intended to visit an Amman school that had been constructed with assistance from U.S. funds.[214] In March 2016, Obama accompanied her husband and children to Cuba in a trip that was seen by the administration as having the possibility of positively impacting relations between the country and America.[215][216] Later that month, the first couple and their daughters traveled to Argentina,[217] meeting with Argentine president Mauricio Macri.[218][219] Obama campaigned for Democratic candidates in the 2010 midterm elections,[220][221] making her debut on the campaign trail in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.[222][223] By the time she began campaigning, Obama's approval rating was 20 percentage points higher than her husband's.[224] Though Obama indicated in January 2010 that a consensus had not been made about whether she would campaign,[225] speculation of her involvement came from her large approval rating as well as reports that she had been invited to speak at events with Democrats such as Barbara Boxer, Mary Jo Kilroy and Joe Sestak.[226] She toured seven states in two weeks within October 2010.[227] Aides reported that, though viewed as essential by the White House, she would not become deeply involved with political discussions nor engage Republicans in public disputes.[228] After the elections, only six of the thirteen Democratic candidates Obama had campaigned for won. The Los Angeles Times concluded that while Obama was indeed more popular than her husband, her \"election scorecard proved no better than his, particularly in her home state\".[229] Obama was a participant in the 2014 midterm elections, held at a time where her popularity superseded her husband's to such an extent that it was theorized she would receive a much larger outpour of support in campaigning. Reporting her travel to Denver, Colorado, David Lightman wrote that while Democrats did not want President Obama to campaign for them, \"the first lady is very popular.\"[230] In May 2014, Obama was found to have a 61% favorable approval rating from a CNN poll, her husband coming in at 43%.[231] In a video released in July, as part of an effort to encourage voter turnout, she called on voters to be \"hungry as you were back in 2008 and 2012\".[232] Obama appeared at a fundraiser in Georgia in September for Democratic senate candidate Michelle Nunn. Obama's approach to campaigning in Georgia strayed from discussing current events and instead broadly stressed the importance of registering to vote and turning out during the elections.[231] Obama's infrequent appearances came from her dislike of being away from her children and Washington politics as well as her distaste for the opposition by Republicans to her husband's agenda and her view that Democrats in the U.S. Senate had not sufficiently been supporters of her initiatives to end childhood obesity.[233] Obama raised her profile in October,[234][235] touring three states in four days.[233] Obama called the elections her husband's \"last campaign\".[236][237] Obama endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and made several high-profile speeches in favor of her, including an address at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.[238] She also appeared multiple times on the campaign trail in either solo or joint appearances with Clinton.[239] On October 13, 2016, Obama heavily criticized Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for the statements he made in a 2005 audio recording while at a Clinton rally in Manchester, New Hampshire.[240] A week later, Trump attempted to revive past comments Obama made in regard to Clinton during the 2008 presidential election.[241][242] With the ascent of her husband as a prominent national politician, Obama became a part of popular culture. In May 2006, Essence listed her among \"25 of the World's Most Inspiring Women\".[243][244] In July 2007, Vanity Fair listed her among \"10 of the World's Best Dressed People\". She was an honorary guest at Oprah Winfrey's Legends Ball as a \"young'un\" paying tribute to the \"Legends\" who helped pave the way for African-American women. In September 2007, 02138 magazine listed her 58th of \"The Harvard 100\"; a list of the prior year's most influential Harvard alumni. Her husband was ranked fourth.[243][245] In July 2008, she made a repeat appearance on the Vanity Fair international best dressed list.[246] She also appeared on the 2008 People list of best-dressed women and was praised by the magazine for her \"classic and confident\" look.[247][248] At the time of her husband's election, some sources anticipated that as a high-profile African-American woman in a stable marriage Obama would be a positive role model who would influence the view the world has of African Americans.[249][250] Her fashion choices were part of the 2009 Fashion week,[251] but Obama's influence in the field did not have the impact on the paucity of African-American models who participate, that some thought it might.[252][253] Obama's public support grew in her early months as First Lady,[134][254] as she was accepted as a role model.[134] On her first trip abroad in April 2009, she toured a cancer ward with Sarah Brown, wife of British prime minister Gordon Brown.[255] Newsweek described her first trip abroad as an exhibition of her so-called \"star power\"[254] and MSN described it as a display of sartorial elegance.[244] Questions were raised by some in the American and British media regarding protocol when the Obamas met Queen Elizabeth II[256] and Michelle reciprocated a touch on her back by the Queen during a reception, purportedly against traditional royal etiquette.[256][257] Palace sources denied that any breach in etiquette had occurred.[258] Obama has been compared to Jacqueline Kennedy due to her sense of style[246] and also to Barbara Bush for her discipline and decorum.[259][260] Obama's style has been described as \"fashion populist\".[51] In 2010, she wore clothes, many high end, from more than fifty design companies with less expensive pieces from J.Crew and Target, and the same year a study found that her patronage was worth an average of $14 million to a company.[261] She became a fashion trendsetter, in particular favoring sleeveless dresses, including her first-term official portrait in a dress by Michael Kors and her ball gowns designed by Jason Wu for both inaugurals.[262] She has also been known for wearing clothes by African designers such as Mimi Plange, Duro Olowu, Maki Oh, and Osei Duro, and styles such as the Adire fabric.[263][264] Obama appeared on the cover and in a photo spread in the March 2009 issue of Vogue.[265][266] Every first lady since Lou Hoover (except Bess Truman) has been in Vogue,[265] but only Hillary Clinton had previously appeared on the cover.[267] Obama later appeared two more times on the cover of Vogue, while First Lady, the last time in December 2016, with photographs by Annie Leibovitz.[268] In August 2011, she became the first woman ever to appear on the cover of Better Homes and Gardens magazine, and the first person in 48 years.[269] In 2013, during the 85th Academy Awards, she became the first first lady to announce the winner of an Oscar (Best Picture, which went to Argo).[270] The media have been criticized for focusing more on the first lady's fashion sense than her serious contributions.[51][271] She said after the 2008 election that she would like to focus attention as First Lady on issues of concern to military and working families.[249][272][273] In 2008, U.S. News & World Report blogger, PBS host and Scripps Howard columnist Bonnie Erbé argued that Obama's own publicists seemed to be feeding the emphasis on style over substance,[274] and said Obama was miscasting herself by overemphasizing style.[73][275] For three straight years – 2018, 2019, and 2020 – Obama topped the Gallup poll asking who is the \"most admired woman\" in the U.S.[276][277] Time magazine features an annual \"Person of the Year\" cover story in which Time recognizes the individual or group of individuals who have had the biggest impact on news headlines over the previous twelve months. In 2020, the magazine decided to retroactively choose a historically deserving woman for each year in which a man had been named Person of the Year, reflecting the fact that a woman or women had been named Person of the Year only eleven times in the preceding hundred. As part of this review, Michelle Obama was named the Woman of the Year for 2008.[278] In May 2017, during an appearance at the Partnership for a Healthier America conference, Obama rebuked the Trump administration for its delay of a federal requirement designed to increase the nutritional standards for school lunches.[279] In June, while attending the WWDC in Silicon Valley, California, Obama called for tech companies to add women for the diversifying of their ranks.[280] In July, Obama honored Eunice Shriver at the 2017 ESPY Awards.[281] In September, Obama delivered an address at the tech conference in Utah charging the Trump administration with having a fearful White House,[282] appeared in a video for the Global Citizens Festival advocating more attention to giving young girls an education,[283] and attended the Inbound 2017 conference in Boston.[284] During an October 3 appearance at the Philadelphia Conference for Women, Obama cited a lack of diversity in politics with contributing to lawmakers being distrusted by other groups.[285] In November, Obama discussed gender disparity in attitudes with Elizabeth Alexander while attending the Obama Foundation Summit in Chicago,[286] and spoke at the Bushnell Center for the Performing Arts in Hartford, Connecticut.[287] In April 2018, Obama responded to speculation that she might be running for president by saying she has \"never had the passion for politics\" and that \"there are millions of women who are inclined and do have the passion for politics.\"[288] On January 2, 2021, Obama encouraged Georgia residents to vote in the state's runoff in the U.S. Senate election and to contact VoteRiders, a non-profit voter ID education organization, to make sure they have the necessary ID to vote.[289] On January 20, 2021, Obama and her husband attended the inauguration of Joe Biden. Michelle Obama wore a matching plum coat, sweater, pants, and belt designed by Sergio Hudson to the inauguration.[290] In 2021, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.[291] On April 28, 2023, Obama, along with actress Kate Capshaw, joined Bruce Springsteen on stage during his show in Barcelona where they provided backing vocals and tambourine on Springsteen's song \"Glory Days\".[292] Amid media speculation over the candidacy of President Biden, Obama's office announced in March 2024 that she would not be running for president in the 2024 United States presidential election.[293] According to a Reuters/Ipsos public opinion poll among 892 registered voters released on July 2, 2024, Michelle Obama was the only listed Democrat option who would defeat Trump in a confrontation, with 50% of the votes for Obama versus 39% for Trump. 55% of the voters also had a favourable view of Obama versus 42% toward Trump.[294][295] On August 20, 2024, Obama gave the next-to-last address on the second night of the 2024 Democratic National Convention and then introduced the final speaker, her husband, former president Barack Obama. The New York Times called her speech \"electrifying\" and suggested she had outshone her husband.[296] Obama's memoir, Becoming, was released in November 2018.[297] By November 2019, it had sold 11.5 million copies.[298] A documentary titled Becoming, which chronicles Obama's book tour promoting the memoir, was released on Netflix on May 6, 2020.[299][300] She received the Grammy Award for Best Audio Book, Narration & Storytelling Recording in 2020.[301] In July 2020, she premiered a podcast titled The Michelle Obama Podcast.[302][303] In February 2021, Obama was announced as an executive producer and presenter on a children's cooking show, Waffles + Mochi.[304] It was released by Netflix on March 16, 2021.[305][306] On September 11, 2021, the Obamas attended a 9/11 memorial to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the attacks.[307] More recently, Regina Hicks had signed a deal with Netflix alongside her and Barack's Higher Ground production company to develop comedies.[308] She received two Children's and Family Emmy Awards at the 1st Children's and Family Emmy Awards: for Outstanding Short Form Program (We the People) and Outstanding Preschool Animated Series (Ada Twist, Scientist).[309] Obama has made occasional guest appearances on TV shows, often portraying herself: iCarly in 2012, Parks and Recreation in 2014, NCIS in 2016, and Black-ish in 2022. She received a Black Reel Awards for Television nomination for Outstanding Guest Actress, Comedy Series for her role in Black-ish.[310] She produced the documentary film Crip Camp (2020) and the biographical drama film Rustin (2023). On July 21, 2022, it was announced that Obama's next book, The Light We Carry: Overcoming in Uncertain Times, would be published in November 2022.[311] The book was published by Penguin Random House.[312] In 2023, Obama received Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Hosted Nonfiction Series or Special nomination at the 75th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards for the Netflix documentary film The Light We Carry: Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey.[313] In November 2023, Obama was named to the BBC's 100 Women list.[314]",

                "content": "The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW Washington, DC 20500 First Lady Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama is a lawyer, writer, and the wife of the 44th President, Barack Obama. She is the first African-American First Lady of the United States. Through her four main initiatives, she became a role model for women and an advocate for healthy families, service members and their families, higher education, and international adolescent girls education. Each of us also comes here tonight,” Michelle Obama told the Democratic National Convention in 2008, “by way of our own improbable journey” and “driven by a simple belief that . . . we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be.” Michelle Obama’s journey began in the South Side of Chicago, where Fraser and Marian Robinson instilled in their daughter a heartfelt commitment to family, hard work, and education. Her father was a pump operator for the Chicago Water Department, while her mother stayed at home to care for Michelle and her older brother Craig. As she watched her father refuse to give in to multiple sclerosis, use two canes to get to his job, and save money to send her to college, she learned that “the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them.” Michelle earned a bachelor’s degree from Princeton University and a juris doctor degree from Harvard Law School. In 1988, she returned to Chicago to join the firm of Sidley Austin. It was there that she met Barack Obama, a summer associate she was assigned to advise. They were married in 1992. By that time Michelle had turned her energies to public service. She was assistant commissioner of planning and development in Chicago’s City Hall before becoming the founding executive director of the Chicago chapter of Public Allies, an AmeriCorps program that prepares young people for public service. In 1996, she joined the University of Chicago as associate dean of student services, where she developed the university’s first community service program. In 2002, she went to work for the University of Chicago Medical Center, where in 2005 she became the vice president of community and external affairs. During these years the Obamas’ daughters Malia and Sasha were born. As first lady, Michelle Obama initiated Let’s Move! a program aiming to end childhood obesity within a generation. Through it, elected officials, business leaders, educators, parents, and faith leaders worked together to provide more nutritious food in schools, bring healthy and affordable food into underserved communities, plant vegetable gardens across America, and provide new opportunities for kids to be more active. Each year local schoolchildren helped plant and harvest the garden she started on the White House South Lawn. Its vegetables and fruits were served at the White House and donated to soup kitchens and food banks. During Barack Obama’s second term Michelle spearheaded the Reach Higher Initiative to help students understand job opportunities and the education and skills they need for those jobs. She encouraged young people to continue their education past high school in technical schools and community colleges as well as at colleges and universities. Worldwide, she championed the education of girls and women. In a commencement address at the City College of New York she told graduates, “Never view your challenges as obstacles.” It is a lesson she has embodied all her life. Throughout her time in the White House Mrs. Obama worked to support veterans and military families. She also focused her energies on what she calls her most important role: MominChief to her daughters, who grew into accomplished young women during their eight years in the White House.

                "content": "Jump to main content Jump to navigation First Lady Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama is a lawyer, writer, and the wife of the 44th and current President, Barack Obama. She is the first African-American First Lady of the United States. Through her four main initiatives, she has become a role model for women and an advocate for healthy families, service members and their families, higher education, and international adolescent girls education. When people ask First Lady Michelle Obama to describe herself, she doesn't hesitate to say that first and foremost, she is Malia and Sasha's mom. But before she was a mother — or a wife, lawyer, or public servant — she was Fraser and Marian Robinson's daughter. The Robinsons lived in a brick bungalow on the South Side of Chicago. Fraser was a pump operator for the Chicago Water Department, and despite being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis at a young age, he hardly ever missed a day of work. Marian stayed home to raise Michelle and her older brother Craig, skillfully managing a busy household filled with love, laughter, and important life lessons. A product of Chicago public schools, Michelle Robinson studied sociology and African-American studies at Princeton University. After graduating from Harvard Law School in 1988, she joined the Chicago law firm Sidley & Austin, where she later met Barack Obama, the man who would become the love of her life. After a few years, Mrs. Obama decided her true calling was working with people to serve their communities and their neighbors. She served as assistant commissioner of planning and development in Chicago's City Hall before becoming the founding executive director of the Chicago chapter of Public Allies, an AmeriCorps program that prepares youth for public service. In 1996, Mrs. Obama joined the University of Chicago with a vision of bringing campus and community together. As Associate Dean of Student Services, she developed the university's first community service program, and under her leadership as Vice President of Community and External Affairs for the University of Chicago Medical Center, volunteerism skyrocketed. Mrs. Obama has continued her efforts to support and inspire young people during her time as First Lady. In 2010, she launched Let’s Move!, bringing together community leaders, educators, medical professionals, parents, and others in a nationwide effort to address the challenge of childhood obesity. Let’s Move! has an ambitious goal: to solve the epidemic of childhood obesity within a generation. Whether it's providing healthier food in our schools, helping kids be more physically active, or urging companies to market healthier foods to our children, Let’s Move! is focused on giving parents the support they need to make healthier choices for their kids. In 2011, Mrs. Obama and Dr. Jill Biden came together to launch Joining Forces, a nationwide initiative calling all Americans to rally around service members, veterans, and their families and support them through wellness, education, and employment opportunities. Joining Forces works hand in hand with the public and private sector to ensure that service members, veterans, and their families have the tools they need to succeed throughout their lives. In 2014, Mrs. Obama launched the Reach Higher Initiative, an effort to inspire young people across America to take charge of their future by completing their education past high school, whether at a professional training program, a community college, or a four-year college or university. Reach Higher aims to ensure that all students understand what they need to complete their education by working to expose students to college and career opportunities; helping them understand financial aid eligibility; encouraging academic planning and summer learning opportunities; and supporting high school counselors who do essential work to help students get into college. In 2015, Mrs. Obama joined President Obama to launch Let Girls Learn, a U.S. government-wide initiative to help girls around the world go to school and stay in school. As part of this effort, Mrs. Obama is calling on countries across the globe to help educate and empower young women, and she is sharing the stories and struggles of these young women with young people here at home to inspire them to commit to their own education. As First Lady, Mrs. Obama looks forward to continuing her work on the issues close to her heart — supporting military families, helping children lead healthier lives, and encouraging all our young people to fulfill their boundless promise.",

                "content": "The potential dangers are boundless in the limited series American Primeval, now streaming on Netflix Jan. 9. Starring Taylor Kitsch (Painkiller, The Terminal List, Waco), the raw, adventurous exploration of the birth of the American West comes to life in the six-episode series. Here’s everything you need to know so far about the grueling journey West. This is America, 1857. Up is down, pain is everywhere, and innocence and tranquility are losing the battle to hatred and fear. Peace is the shrinking minority, and very few possess grace — even fewer know compassion. There’s no safe haven in these wild lands, and only one goal matters: survival. American Primeval is a fictionalized dramatization and examination of the violent collision of culture, religion, and community as men and women fight and die for control of this world. The ensemble tells a story of the sacrifice all must pay when they choose to enter the lawless and brutal frontier. “We are very appreciative that Netflix is trusting us to take a big swing with American Primeval,” director and executive producer Pete Berg (Friday Night Lights, Lone Survivor) told Netflix. “I’m looking forward to taking viewers into the most dynamic, intense, and heart-pounding survival tale humanly possible. We are going into the belly of the beast.” American Primeval is Berg’s first project under his first-look deal with Netflix and is written by Mark L. Smith (The Midnight Sky, The Revenant, Overlord), with Eric Newman (Griselda, Narcos, The Watcher) serving as showrunner and executive producer. This also marks the second collaboration between Berg, Newman, and Kitsch, who worked together on the limited series Painkiller, which premiered on service in 2023. The cast of American Primeval includes: Right up top! See Kitsch, Gilpin, and more as they face a new frontier where the only goal is survival. Yes, check out Kitsch, Gilpin, Whigham, and more in action above. Out of 130 shooting days on American Primeval, only two(!) were filmed indoors. The rest were all shot on location in New Mexico, at places including Pueblo de Cochiti, Santa Clara Pueblo, Bonanza Creek Ranch, Parajito Mountain Ski Area, and Charles R Ranch. In building out the scope of American Primeval, Berg was inspired by his love for the Robert Redford film Jeremiah Johnson. “When I saw it as a kid, I felt like I was in it,” the director says. “I was in the elements … just surviving, and I always wanted to do something like that.” American Primeval was Berg, Newman, and Smith’s chance to go into the New Mexico mountains and create that kind of immersive experience for viewers. “If ever there was anything easier said than done, it’s this,” says Newman. “I believe all of us will forever be haunted in scripts by the words ‘it snows’ or ‘night, exterior night.’ ” While filming, the actors were braving the kind of weather their characters would have faced in 1857, trudging through the snow, rain, thunder, and lightning, with rattlesnake cameos a daily occurrence on set. Kitsch wouldn’t have had it any other way. “When you’re on hour 15 of shooting, and you’re freezing, and you’re beyond exhausted, it all comes into play,” the actor said. “There’s nothing better than shooting on location. I loved it.” Because the crew was up in the remote mountains, they all really learned how to survive together as a team. “We didn’t have Wi-Fi anywhere we were, we had no cell service,” says Berg. “So we were actually interacting with each other and bonding.” If you recognized the dulcet tones of the folk anthem “This Land Is Your Land” in the closing moments of the American Primeval finale, then you would have correctly named that tune. Berg enlisted the Texas band Explosions in the Sky, who he’d previously worked with on Friday Night Lights and Lone Survivor, to cover the famed Woody Guthrie song. “Explosions has a really unique ability to be both tragic and triumphant at the same time,” Berg tells Tudum. “And in doing so, they’re going to find levels of emotion and real propulsive drive simultaneously.” While Berg and Newman knew the show would be violent, they still wanted viewers to be able to find emotional touchstones amidst the bleakness. They also appreciated how, at its core, the song isn’t a love letter to America, but a song of protest — Guthrie wrote the lyrics in response to Irving Berlin’s “God Bless America.” “It’s a protest song about perceived injustice, hardship, and suffering that Woody [Guthrie] was seeing all throughout America,” says Berg. “And those things certainly felt appropriate to American Primeval.” Additional songs featured in the series include “Backporch Pick” by Christian Marie Jean Bernard Seguret and Olivier Noel Andres, “Waltzing in the Moonlight” by George Doering and Steven Lindsey, and the Latter Day Saints hymn “Adam-ondi-Ahman” (“This Earth Was Once a Garden Place”), which you can hear Jacob (DeHaan) sing throughout the show. American Primeval is available to stream on Netflix now.

Today's hints 2. Start letter 3. Today's answer 4. Yesterday's answer Today's Wordle answer is a touch easier than recent puzzles. According to the New York Times' WordleBot, the average player will complete Wordle #1,301 in 3.9 moves in easy mode, or 3.8 if playing by hard rules. Each day, we will update this article with Wordle hints and tips to help you find today's answer. And if the hints aren't enough, we'll even give you the answer, in case you're really stuck or just haven't had time to complete today's puzzle. Plus, we are also including an analysis of yesterday's puzzle, #1,300, in case you're reading this in a different time zone. So be warned: spoilers lie ahead for game #1,301. Only read on if you want to know today's Wordle answer! Our first tip is that you should use one of the best Wordle start words for every game you play. But if you want some more specific clues to today's Wordle answer, then here you go: * By vowel, we mean A, E, I, O, U. There are other letters that are sometimes considered to be vowels, depending on how they are used. Those hints should get you at least some of the way towards finding today's Wordle answer. If not, then you can read on for bigger clues; or, if you just want to know the answer, then skip down further for that. Alright then, here's a larger hint: Today's Wordle answer is inching along. Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips. The answer to Wordle #1,301 starts with C, so combined with the hints above you should now have all the clues you need to get the answer and not break a Wordle streak. OK, it's now time to scroll down for the answer… So, what is today's Wordle answer for game #1,301? Drumroll, please — it's CRAWL. Hello Wordlers. After yesterday's frustrating puzzle, today's was a breath of fresh air. As it features 'R', 'A' and 'L', CRAWL contains half of the six most common Wordle letters, even if 'W' is the sixth rarest. ORATE turned 'R' and 'A' green right away, which meant just 35 possible answers were left in play, according to WordleBot*. WordleBot's best Wordle start words were even better, though. PLANE leaves 22 answers, while PLATE lowers that to 19. If you opened with PLACE only four options would be available. On my second go, I try and play a mix of the five next most common characters: 'L', 'I', 'S', 'N' and 'C'. I did that with DRAIN, which unfortunately was a bit of a bust, with no new characters going yellow or green. Still, I was down to 16 possibilities. How about CRAWL? That's better! Both 'C' and 'W' turned yellow, leaving just one option. After a little thought, I typed in CRAWL and completed the puzzle in four moves. Hopefully you did well today, Wordlers. See you tomorrow. * These were: BRASH, BRASS, BRAWL, CRACK, CRASH, CRAWL, CRAZY, GRASP, GRASS, GRAVY, GRAPH, CRASS, CRAMP, FRACK, WRACK, BRAVA, FRANK, CRANK, PRANK, FRANC, BRAIN, GRAIN, BRAND, GRAND, FRAIL, GRAIL, DRAMA, DRAWL, BRAWN, PRAWN, DRAIN, DRANK, DRAWN, FRAUD and BRAID. Reading this in a later time zone? The Wordle answer for game #1,300 was WAFER. Hello Wordlers. For the second day in a row, the Wordle answer features three of the five most common Wordle letters, but where a lot of letters can fit in the gaps once you have them in the right place. For that reason, I only just squeaked through on my sixth answer. I opened with ORATE, which gave me three yellow letters: 'R', 'A' and 'E'. This still left 78 possible answers, however, which made WordleBot's best Wordle start words more effective. CARET and CARTE, for example, leave 34 answers each, while CATER lowers that to 31. The best I could see after a lot of scrolling was LATER and ALTER, which both leave 29 possibilities. I try to play a mix of 'L', 'I', 'S', 'N' and 'C' on my second go, and I opted for SANER today, which turned all three yellow letters green. But amazingly, that still leaves 30 possibilities for filling the gaps according to WordleBot*, which meant I had a fight on my hands. How about PALER? Nope. Down to 18 answers. MAKER? No. Down to 13. WAGER? Still no! But this time I got a green 'W', which at least gave me a fighting chance going into my last turn. I got lucky. I was torn between WAFER and WAVER, and chose the former, which was correct. WordleBot points out that it could also have been WADER, so a very lucky result. I imagine a lot of streaks will have ended today. Well done if you survived. See you tomorrow, Wordlers. * These were: BAKER, EAGER, MAKER, RARER, RACER, WAGER, WAVER, GAMER, WAFER, FAKER, RAGER, GAYER, RAVER, CARER, GAZER, BARER, FADER, WADER, PAPER, PAGER, PAYER, PACER, PAVER, PARER, LAYER, LAGER, LAMER, CAPER, PALER and BALER. If you're looking for a list of older Wordle answers, we can also help. Here's a list going back 20 games. The best tip I can give is to use one of the best Wordle start words. I can't stress this enough — it makes a massive difference. Without one, you'll be scrabbling around in the dark trying (and possibly failing) to find the right five letters (or possibly fewer) out of the 26 possibles. But clever people (not me) have done the math and identified the best start words based on both frequency in English and frequency among Wordle answers. So use them! Secondly, think about combinations, especially at the start and end. Some options are far more common than others — for instance, SH, ST, CR and CH all feature frequently. Vowels obviously need consideration too: not all Wordle answers will contain more than one, but plenty do, and some even have three. A good Wordle start word should have used a couple, but if they don't feature you might well want to try another one or two on your next go. Plus, remember the Y — this sometimes acts as a surrogate vowel, and is easy to forget. It also appears at the end of plenty of words. Finally, try out possibilities. So long as you don't press 'Enter' you can try possible answers to see how they look on screen. Put in likely letters plus any you know are definitely in the word, then mentally change one to the other available options. This technique has worked for me multiple times, and it's particularly helpful when the word in question is not an obvious one (like FJORD or ISLET).

Wordle officially launched in October 2021, but it was actually started earlier in June of that year and celebrated its first birthday on June 19, 2022. (You can read my thoughts on the 5 things Wordle needs to improve if it's to keep us playing on into another year.) However, it only grew in popularity towards the end of the year, then went viral in January as the world woke up to its charms. In fact, it proved so successful that The New York Times bought Wordle for a seven-figure sum in early February and the game is now part of NYT Games. It's played via the NYT Games website here, and is entirely free. Both the NYT and the game's creator, Josh Wardle, have stated that it will remain free. Some people think that Wordle has got harder since the NYT takeover, but it really hasn't. Wordle is a simple game in which your challenge is to guess a five-letter word in six attempts. Each time you guess, you're told which of your chosen letters are in the target word, and whether they are in the right place. If a letter is in the correct place, it turns green. If it's in the word but in the wrong place, it turns yellow. And if it's not in the word at all, it turns gray. There's just one puzzle a day, and everyone completes the same one. It resets at midnight each day. You'll find more information about the game in our What is Wordle? article. If you've solved Wordle and need help with other games from the New York Times, we suggest you check out our guide on today's NYT Strands answer, which will give you some hints as well as the full answer to today's puzzle. If you're eager for another game to pass the time while you wait, we've put together a list of the best Wordle alternatives. Other Wordle alternatives to try are the ultra-stressful (but very good) Squabble and the soccer-themed, Who Are Ya?. We also like the geography-based Wordle clone Worldle, the Star Wars-themed SWordle and the math-based Mathler. There are certainly plenty of options once you've finished Wordle for the day!

The success of Wordle has meant that everyone has tried their hand at making similar games – even Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo chipped in to launch Weezle, which predictably tasks players with working out a lyric from the band’s songs each day. If Weezer‘s not the band for you, there’s always Taylordle – which is the same game, except with Taylor Swift lyrics. Beyond that, there’s also a battle royale, a dungeon crawler, and one that tests your knowledge of geography – so there’s plenty to choose from at the moment. There’s even a NSFW version for adults-only! Wordle is available for free on PC and mobile. The world’s defining voice in music and pop culture: breaking what’s new and what’s next since 1952.

SPOILER WARNING: Today's Wordle answer and hints are below, so don't read on if you don't want to see them. Marc is TechRadar’s Global Editor in Chief and has been obsessed with Wordle for more than two years. He's authored dozens of articles on the game for TechRadar and its sister site Tom's Guide, including a detailed analysis of the most common letters in Wordle in every position and a guide to the best Wordle start words. He's also played every Wordle ever and only lost once and yes, he takes it all too seriously. • Wordle today has a vowel in one place*. * Note that by vowel we mean the five standard vowels (A, E, I, O, U), not Y (which is sometimes counted as a vowel too). • The first letter in today's Wordle answer is C. C is a very common starting letter in Wordle – in fact, it's the second most common of all, behind only S. • There are no repeated letters in today's Wordle. Repeated letters are quite common in the game, with 748 of the 2,309 Wordle answers containing one. However, it's still more likely that a Wordle doesn't have one. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. • The last letter in today's Wordle is L. L is a really common letter to find at the end of a Wordle. There are 155 games that finish with an L, and it ranks as the fifth most likely letter there. Still looking for more Wordle hints today? Here's an extra one for game #1301.

If you don't want to know today's answer then DO NOT SCROLL ANY FURTHER BECAUSE IT IS PRINTED BELOW. So don't say you weren't warned! * From WordleBot's Top 20 start words Today's Wordle answer (game #1301) is… CRAWL. A bad start word can be a good start word on the right day – you just need a bit of luck and the right follow-up. Today, my random word generator dealt me LLAMA – a ridiculous word that only contains three distinct letters, of which one is the less-than-common M. This could have been a disaster; WordleBot said afterwards that it was a \"distinctive\" opening word, that \"was played by less than 0.1% of players.\" Leaving aside the fact that it should be \"fewer than\", not \"less than\", and that using both \"played\" and \"players\" in the same sentence is a bit clumsy, this was factually correct – but without telling the entire story. Yes, it was distinctive, but it was also not particularly good – only 67/99 for skill, on the 'bot's scale. However, it proved a very, very lucky guess today. Not only did it give me a yellow L and A, but it ruled out the possibility of a repeated L (or indeed a repeated A). That fact would come in handy later on. That cut my possibles list to 26, but other start words performed even better. For instance, CRANE and TRACE each left only seven words. And here we get to the meat of today's analysis, because even with only a few words left you may still have needed a couple more guesses to get the answer, because it's a minor example of the too-many-answers problem. There are only really four of them – CRAWL, TRAWL, DRAWL and BRAWL – but they were all played by plenty of people today as they hunted down the answer. It will have been a tough one on hard mode, for sure. On standard mode it's not too bad, but its average of 3.9 indicates that it's not easy either. My second guess was good, but not quite good enough to give me a three. I played STILE, which cut my options down to four – but given that three of them were CRAWL, DRAWL and BRAWL, I wasn't going to shoot for the answer on the next attempt. No, I'd need to narrow them down, which I did with CROWD. This worked perfectly, giving me a green C, R and W, and meaning that I didn't need to worry about the fact that I'd missed a fourth possibility, GNARL. How did you do today? Send me an email and let me know. In a different time zone where it's still Thursday? Don't worry – I can give you some clues for Wordle #1300, too. * Note that by vowel we mean the five standard vowels (A, E, I, O, U), not Y (which is sometimes counted as a vowel too). W is a fairly average letter when it comes to starting an answer. There are 82 solutions that begin with a W, with means that it ranks 13th – so right in the middle of the alphabet. Repeated letters are quite common in the game, with 748 of the 2,309 Wordle answers containing one. However, it's still more likely that a Wordle doesn't have one. R is a very common letter to end a Wordle answer – it's actually the 4th most common there, behind E, Y and T. Still looking for more Wordle hints? Here's an extra one for game #1300. * From WordleBot's Top 20 start words Yesterday's Wordle answer (game #1300) was… WAFER. It's only a couple of days since I spent several paragraphs talking about the inherent difficulty of ER answers in relation to CYBER and now here we are with a Wordle that's even tougher, 4.9 to that word's 4.6 (Note – revised up to 5.0 by today). It isn't hard to see why, either: the two consonants in the first and third positions are generally the ones that determine how difficult an ER word is, and today they are the less-than-common W and F. Okay, F isn't exactly uncommon overall – it ranks 19th, so lower-middle is a fairer description – but it mainly appears at the start of a word (accounting for nearly two-thirds of its appearances). W, meanwhile, is uncommon. Plus, the fact that those two letters are both included today, rather than one of the consonants being a far-more-likely T or S or L or C, makes matters worse. I scored a six, my first for more than a month, but given that even WordleBot could only manage a five, I'm not too upset about that. Mostly I'm just glad I didn't fail. I don't think my streak was ever in doubt, as it happens, but I am annoyed at myself for slightly messing up my fourth guess. I'd played well enough up to that point, following my now-traditional poor opener (LOAMY, in this case) with TASER. TASER was actually the best performing of the top 20 start words today, leaving 30 answers (mine left 334), so playing it second got me back on track. I now had 21 words left, WordleBot told me later, and my next choice of PORCH cut those in half to 11. So far, so good: I knew it was an ER word, I knew there was an A in it, and I now knew there was no R repeated in the middle – thus ruling out the likes of CARER, RARER and BARER, all of which were on my list. It also removed my C- and P-words – CAPER, PACER, RACER, PAPER, PAGER and PAVER among them. It still left a motley crew of Ws (WAGER, WAFER, WADER, WAVER), Ks (BAKER, FAKER), Gs (EAGER, GAZER) and combinations of those letters. And it left some that began with an R, including RAVER. I thought WORKS was a good next guess, as it included both W and K, but those were the only two letters still in play out of the five, so it was wasteful. WordleBot suggested that GAWKY – which also added in a G – would have been more efficient, and it is entirely correct. My bad. Still, WORKS was not a disaster, giving me the green W and leaving four words. These were WAGER, WAFER, WAVER and WADER, and I knew that if I played FUDGE next I would be sure to get the answer. When the F turned yellow that left WAFER as the solution, and I escaped with my streak intact on the hardest Wordle of 2025 so far. I've been playing Wordle every day for more than two years now and have tracked all of the previous answers so I can help you improve your game. Here are the last 50 solutions starting with yesterday's answer, or check out my past Wordle answers page for the full list. If you're on this page then you almost certainly know what Wordle is already, and indeed have probably been playing it for a while. And even if you've not been playing it, you must surely have heard of it by now, because it's the viral word game phenomenon that took the world by storm last year and is still going strong in 2024. We've got a full guide to the game in our What is Wordle page, but if you just want a refresher then here are the basics. Wordle challenges you to guess a new five-letter word each day. You get six guesses, with each one revealing a little more information. If one of the letters in your guess is in the answer and in the right place, it turns green. If it's in the answer but in the wrong place, it turns yellow. And if it's not in the answer at all it turns gray. Simple, eh? It's played online via the Wordle website or the New York Times' Crossword app (iOS / Android), and is entirely free. Crucially, the answer is the same for everyone each day, meaning that you're competing against the rest of the world, rather than just against yourself or the game. The puzzle then resets each day at midnight in your local time, giving you a new challenge, and the chance to extend your streak. The rules of Wordle are pretty straightforward, but with a couple of curveballs thrown in for good measure. 1. Letters that are in the answer and in the right place turn green. 2. Letters that are in the answer but in the wrong place turn yellow. 3. Letters that are not in the answer turn gray. 4. Answers are never plural. 5. Letters can appear more than once. So if your guess includes two of one letter, they may both turn yellow, both turn green, or one could be yellow and the other green. 6. Each guess must be a valid word in Wordle's dictionary. You can't guess ABCDE, for instance. 7. You do not have to include correct letters in subsequent guesses unless you play on Hard mode. 8. You have six guesses to solve the Wordle. 9. You must complete the daily Wordle before midnight in your timezone. 10. All answers are drawn from Wordle's list of 2,309 solutions. However… 11. Wordle will accept a wider pool of words as guesses – some 10,000 of them. For instance, you can guess a plural such as WORDS. It definitely won't be right (see point 4 above), but Wordle will accept it as a guess.

                "content": "RodeoHouston 2025 RodeoHouston is back in the saddle again and is bringing major star power to the star-shaped stage for its 2025 lineup. After drawing over 1.3 million people to concerts last year, officials revealed this year’s performers at a media event at NRG Center, next door to NRG Stadium. While the Beyoncé rumors didn't pan out, the acts playing from March 4-23 include a variety of genres, heavily focused on country, but also including pop, rock, hip-hop, R&B, regional Mexican, and Christian music. Tickets will go on sale at rodeohouston.com on Thursday, January 16, in two waves at 10 am and 2 pm. Arguably the biggest standout is Post Malone, who makes his RodeoHouston debut on Tuesday, March 18 in what should be a massive draw. The hugely successful rap star is back in Houston after selling out two nights at Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion last fall. His turn towards country music on his No. 1 album, F-1 Trillion, featuring the No. 1 single “I Had Some Help” with country bad boy Morgan Wallen, and songs with Luke Bryan and Blake Shelton, was no doubt on the minds of RodeoHouston organizers. One of the longest-running rodeo favorites, Reba McEntire will open the 2025 season on Tuesday, March 4. She holds one of the organization’s highest honors as the first woman inducted to RodeoHouston’s Star Trail of Fame in 2007. This will be her 20th performance on the rotating stage and her first time back in 11 years. Other eyebrow-raising headliners include Bun B's Birthday Bonanza on Black Heritage Night (Friday, March 7). This is the fourth consecutive year that the chopped and screwed rap legend will bring his “International Players Anthem” to RodeoHouston, the 2024 edition being one of the most buzzed about shows of the year, with appearances by Drake, Nelly, Eve, Rick Ross, and others. As for who will turn up this year, let the speculation begin. Also notable is fast-rising Americana honkytonk country artist, the San Benito, TX-raised Charley Crockett, making his debut on Monday, March 17. Anyone who has caught him on small club stages in Houston as he paid his dues will find this a reason to celebrate this huge step-up in audience size. This year’s lineup is noticeably embracing a younger demographic, especially in the country ranks. Up-and-comers, Riley Green (March 5), Zach Top (March 11), and Kelly Clarkson’s favorite heartthrobWarren Zeiders (March 15) all make their debuts and are a glimpse at the future. The 24-year-old Bailey Zimmerman (March 8) achieved three consecutive No. 1 singles, including the album’s namesake, “Religiously,” deemed the biggest streaming country debut of all time upon its release. Outside of the country genre, streaming stars and pop-rock trio AJR fill the pop-rock role that Jonas Brothers shattered records with last year, appearing on Thursday, March 6. Mexican singer-songwriter Carin León plays on Sunday, March 9, and two-time Grammy Award-winning contemporary Christian artist Lauren Daigle returns for her second stint on Wednesday, March 12. Rock and Roll Hall of Famers, Journey, follow-up their epic 2022 RodeoHouston performance on Friday, March 14, while Mexican-American band Grupo Frontera takes the mantle for the seat-filling Go Tejano Day on Sunday, March 16.

Always aware of the many different audiences that appreciate a day on the midway, organizers have another eclectic mix of youthful names and legacy acts, ensuring that many Houstonians will have a reason to head to NRG Stadium for at least one night of music this March. Giddy up! Reba McEntire opens the 2025 RodeoHouston with her 20th appearance on Tuesday, March 4. Movie Review A variety of actors have had the good fortune of having career resurgences thanks to someone giving them a chance after they passed their prime, including John Travolta after Pulp Fiction, Keanu Reeves after John Wick, and Brendan Fraser after The Whale. Pamela Anderson is the latest actor hoping to be reclaimed thanks to her starring role in The Last Showgirl. In the meta-story, the 57-year-old Anderson plays Shelly, an aging showgirl at a third tier Las Vegas casino. The show itself, called Le Razzle Dazzle, is on its last legs, and Shelly finds herself at a crossroads, with no other skills or financial means on which to fall back. While younger showgirls like Jodie (Kiernan Shipka) and Mary-Anne (Brenda Song) are willing to move on to more sexually-suggestive shows, Shelly is only comfortable with the tried-and-true showgirl way. Three other people in her life — estranged daughter Hannah (Billie Lourd), best friend Annette (Jamie Lee Curtis), and stage manager Eddie (Dave Bautista) — seem to help and hurt her in equal measure. The effectiveness of the film, directed by Gia Coppola and written by Kate Gersten, depends heavily on whether the viewer is willing to accept Anderson, who’s still best known for her role on Baywatch, as a serious actor. If Coppola and Gersten are trying to show a different side of Anderson, they fail; having her play a character with little-to-no makeup and a dramatic arc does not make up for her poor acting skills and a high voice that borders on shrill. And because the story is so dependent on Anderson — she appears in literally every scene — it never has a chance of becoming interesting or involving. Her character has personal issues that are objectively sad, but any weight that might have resulted from those storylines are lost along the way. She’s not helped by an over-the-top performance by Curtis, who seems to be milking her Oscar from Everything Everywhere All at Oncefor all it’s worth. Coppola seems to be going for an old-school feel for the film to match the storyline. The film has a weird, unfocused look to it at times, giving the audience visuals that are definitely not high-definition. Whether she’s actually using an old film stock or manipulating the image to make it look like an old film, the effect is the same, with imperfections appearing on the screen often. Anderson — who earned a nomination for a Golden Globe for Best Female Actor for her role — and Curtis seem to take up most of the oxygen of the film, leaving little to remember from anyone else. Shipka had a breakout movie year thanks to appearances in Twisters and Longlegs, but her role here gives her little to do. The same goes for Bautista, although at least he gets to put on a grey wig and act in a way that doesn’t emphasize his bulky physique. While actors should never be shunted aside simply because they’ve aged out of an accepted age range, you also have to have the ability to prove you still belong. Anderson can’t get out of her own way in The Last Showgirl, and consequently the film itself never has any dramatic depth, either. --- The Last Showgirl opens in theaters on January 10.",

                "content": "Den of Thieves 2: Pantera is a 2025 American heist film that serves as the sequel to the 2018 film Den of Thieves. Gerard Butler and O'Shea Jackson Jr. reprise their roles from the first film, while Christian Gudegast returns to write and direct. Inspired by the 2003 Antwerp diamond heist, the plot follows an LAPD sheriff who follows a suspected thief to Europe in an attempt to team-up with him for a robbery.[3][4] Lionsgate theatrically released the film in the United States on January 10, 2025. Immediately following the events of Den of Thieves, sheriff \"Big Nick\" O'Brien is tracking down Donnie Wilson, who escaped to Europe and is planning another heist. After the release of Den of Thieves in 2018, development of a sequel was in the works with plans for Christian Gudegast to return as director and writer, as well as for Gerard Butler and O'Shea Jackson Jr. to return and reprise their roles.[5] The film was originally slated to begin filming in 2022.[9][10] Principal photography took place from April to July 2023 in the United Kingdom and the Canary Islands.[7][6] The production transformed several aspects of the main streets in Santa Cruz de Tenerife for the shoot, such as building up a police station and jewelry store and setting up a local bar to appear French.[11] Originally set to be distributed by STX Entertainment, as with the first film, Briarcliff Entertainment purchased the film for distribution in the United States in May 2023 with Sierra/Affinity handling international sales of the film with a wide theatrical release being planned in the United States for late 2024.[12] However, in May 2024, Lionsgate was announced to have distribution rights as part of their acquisition of financiers Entertainment One (later rebranded to Lionsgate Canada) from Hasbro in December 2023, with the film released in the United States on January 10, 2025.[13] In the United States and Canada, Den of Thieves 2: Pantera was released alongside Better Man, and is projected to gross $11–13 million from 3,008 theaters in its opening weekend.[2] The film made $1.35 million from Thursday night previews.[14] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 67% of 22 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.9/10.[15] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 62 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[16]",

And this time around, things are pretty much exactly the same. Written and directed by Christian Gudegast, who also wrote and directed the first film, Den of Thieves 2 finds sheriff “Big Nick” O’Brien (Butler) once again tracking down the criminal Donnie Wilson (Jackson Jr.), who escaped to Europe and is planning another heist. That guy just can’t get enough of stealing stuff! Meadow Williams will also reprise her role from the first film, and other cast members include Evin Ahmad, Salvatore Esposito, and Swen Temmell. This sequel was originally supposed to come out in 2024, but was delayed. Don’t worry, because the wait is finally over. Here’s all the information you need to know about how to watch Den of Thieves 2: Pantera, including when we expect to see Den of Thieves 2: Pantera on digital and streaming on Starz. For now, Den of Thieves 2: Pantera will only available to watch in a movie theater, when it opens in theaters in the U.S. on Friday, January 10. You can find a showing near you via Fandango. Den of Thieves 2 is not yet available to watch online or on streaming. Den of Thieves 2 is not streaming on Netflix, and likely will not be on Netflix any time soon, due to the fact that the film is a Lionsgate release in the U.K., and will likely stream on Starz, the streaming platform owned by Lionsgate, instead. You will be able to purchase Den of Thieves 2 on Amazon Prime Video eventually, when the movie becomes available to buy and rent on digital, but you will not be able to stream Den of Thieves 2 on Prime Video free with a Prime subscription, because it is not a Prime original movie. If you want to watch Den of Thieves 2 movie at home, you’ll have to wait for the film to be available to buy or rent on digital platforms, or wait for it to stream on Starz. Den of Thieves 2 is not yet streaming on Starz. You might see Den of Thieves 2 on Starz in spring 2025, because that is the streaming platform owned by Lionsgate. Another Lionsgate film, Borderlands, was released on premium video-on-demand after three weeks in theaters, and began streaming on Starz on December 25, about four and a half months after the movie opened in the theaters. If Den of Thieves 2 follows the same release pattern, you can expect to see the movie on digital by the end of this month, and on Starz in about four and a half months, which would be around late May 2025. But this is all speculation. If you want to watch Den of Thieves 2: Pantera right away, you can watch it in a movie theater.

                "title": "2025 NFL Draft: Penn State's Abdul Carter declares as potential top-10 pick after All-American junior season - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Penn State defensive star Abdul Carter has declared for 2025 NFL Draft, his agent Drew Rosenhaus told ESPN. Carter is regarded as a potential top-10 pick after a monster junior season in which he earned CBS Sports first-team All-America honors. Carter also earned Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year while finishing the season with 24 tackles for loss and 12 sacks and spearheading the charge for one of the nation's top defenses. With the benefit of playing 16 games, Carter finished the season No. 1 nationally in sacks and tackles for loss in his first full season as a dedicated pass rusher after spending time as an off-ball linebacker in 2022 and 2023. His 65 quarterback pressures ranked second nationally in 2024, and Carter also forced five fumbles over the course of his career. The former four-star prospect was a star throughout his three seasons in Happy Valley but took his dominance to new heights as a junior. He put his disruptiveness on display in Penn State's 27-24 loss to Notre Dame on Thursday night in the College Football Playoff semifinal at the Orange Bowl with a sack and two tackles for loss while playing through a shoulder injury. Carter was regarded as a game-time decision but suited up and made an impact throughout. \"Abdul, I'm really proud of him,\" Penn State coach James Franklin said afterward. \"He gutted it out today, showed tremendous mental and physical toughness and was disruptive in the game.\" Carter ranks as the No. 8 overall player in the 2025 CBS Sports NFL Draft Prospect Rankings. He is considered the No. 2 EDGE in the class behind Tennessee's James Pearce and landed as high as No. 4 in the most-recent series of mock drafts from a group CBS Sports draft experts. \"I see only a few true blue-chip prospects in this class, and Carter is one of them,\" said analyst Mike Renner, who projected Carter at No. 4 to the Carolina Panthers. \"His twitch is remarkable for a man his size. The Panthers simply need any talent they can get at this point -- especially on the defensive side of the ball.\" At 6-foot-3, Carter is on the shorter side for what scouts typically prefer in EDGE players. However, in his CBS Sports draft profile, it's noted that he \"makes up for that with his ability to bend at the waist and flatten at the high side of his rush.\" Carter's departure is part of a major talent exodus that Penn State will grapple with entering the 2025 season. Defensive lineman Dani Dennis-Sutton and safeties Kevin Winston Jr., Jaylen Reed are also considered top-120 prospects in the CBS Sports NFL Draft Prospect Rankings. Veteran defensive tackle Dvon Ellies is out of eligibility, and budding star Zane Durant will have a draft decision to make after a strong junior season. Offensively, the Nittany Lions will be forced to replace do-it-all star Tyler Warren at tight end. Running backs Nick Singleton and Kaytron Allen — both of whom surpassed 1,000 yards rushing in 2024 — have draft decisions to make as well. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
