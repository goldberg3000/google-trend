                "content": "League Cup Advertisement live Updated 2m ago Newcastle United will take a 2-0 advantage into the second leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final against Arsenal. Goals either side of half-time from Alexander Isak and then Anthony Gordon were enough to give Eddie Howe's side a commanding aggregate lead. Arsenal had plenty of chances to get themselves on the scoreline but were left wanting in front of goal again with Jurrien Timber, Gabriel Martinelli and Kai Havertz all missing big opportunities. The second leg of this tie will be played at St James' Park on Wednesday, February 5. Subscribe to The Athletic on an exclusive offer here. GO FURTHER Arsenal 0 Newcastle 2 – Eddie Howe’s greatest feat yet? What next for Arsenal? Unfortunately, there is a long time to wait for the second leg of this one. That match, taking place at St James' Park, will be played on Wednesday, February 5. Less than 24 hours to wait for more Carabao Cup semi-final action, though, as the first leg between Tottenham and Liverpool comes your way at 8pm (GMT) tomorrow evening. As with all four semi-final matches, that will be covered live here on The Athletic. Advertisement After the match, Eddie Howe was asked about goalkeeper Martin Dubravka, who looked to be emotional and almost waving goodbye to fans at the end. He's been very heavily linked with Saudi Arabian club Al-Shabab. \"I've nothing to add to that,\" Howe said. \"We’ve been preparing for this game. He's been playing very well and I wouldn’t want to lose him.\" Pushed on it, he added: \"I know nothing, genuinely.\" He concluded \"that would be my wish,\" when asked if Dubravka could be offered a new contract and stay at the club. Getty Images Successive away wins for Newcastle at Manchester United's Old Trafford, Tottenham, and Arsenal's Emirates Stadium. What a week for a Newcastle supporter on the road! We have bemoaned Arsenal's lack of creativity on many an occasion this season, but that was not their downfall this evening. That fact, however, did not ease the frustration for Arteta. \"Obviously that isn't going to take the disappointment away,\" he said. \"The way the team tries every three days is unbelievable. And we have to be disappointed because it's another result that we wanted and that they don't deserve, but that's the reality.\" Asked about the challenge facing his players ahead of the second leg, the Arsenal boss was emphatic: \"I have full belief. I have seen my team play against them. I have full belief that we can do it.\" To me, these (spicy) two lines from Mikel Arteta's post-match interview detect some sore-loser-ship: \"Very deflected goals. Credit to them for managing to win the game like this.\" Hmm. I mean, the first goal was a good, possibly slightly fortuitous but probably intentional touch from Jacob Murphy into Alexander Isak's path. And Isak's shot took a slight nick on its way through to David Raya before Anthony Gordon tapped home, but it was really poor defending to allow Isak the shot. Not exactly 'two deflections'. And, seemingly a bit of back-handed compliment from Arteta in praising Newcastle for winning via those 'two deflections'. Getty Images No prizes for guessing the first question faced by Mikel Arteta in his post-match interview with Sky Sports — he was asked about the contrasting fortunes of the two teams in front of goal. \"That was the biggest difference in the game,\" he said. \"In every other aspect, we were the better team. But this is about scoring and they managed with the chances they had. And very deflected goals. Credit to them for managing to win the game like this. \"When we miss the chances we miss and concede those goals, it's always tough. But the team reacted and the team was very willing. We generated a lot of situations but it's true, they defended their box very well with their lives. \"They blocked a lot of shots, credit to them.\" Advertisement Getty Images Victorious Newcastle manager Eddie Howe, speaking to ITV after the game, said: \"Very pleased with the players, it was a tough game for us in many respects. We had players struggling at half-time. Really pleased with how we played. \"First half (Alexander Isak) was electric, he played really well. He scored but I just thought his general game was in a really good place. He was feeling his hamstring a bit at half-time so we had to manage him in the second half and that was a big blow to our performance. \"We rode our luck at times and I think Martin (Dubravka) played really well and made some really good saves. The set plays in the main we got the small details right. \"Our mentality to defend our goal with the blocked shots, the heroic pieces of defending that we saw in the last 20 to 30 minutes, it's great for us for the future.\" The Athletic/Getty Images Recognise that goal celebration from Anthony Gordon? A certain former Arsenal striker might remember it... Getty Images Captain for the evening Dan Burn turned in a performance worthy of the armband. He was asked about how he felt about the collective defensive showing. \"Very proud,\" he told Sky Sports. \"It was always going to be like that in the second half when we went two goals up. It's only half the job done but I thought everyone defended brilliantly. \"To get a result here, you have to defend set pieces well. They're so good at them. Everyone was brilliant. (Arsenal) had chances and probably deserved a goal, but throwing bodies on the line managed to get us over (the line).\" Since the 1987-1988 season, this is the ninth time that an away team has had a two-goal advantage going into the Carabao Cup semi-final second leg. On each and every one of the previous eight occasions, the side two goals up has progressed to the final. Hell of an ask for Arsenal to overturn this lead! Getty Images Another Player of the Match award for Alexander Isak and another modest post-match interview, this time with Sky Sports — he was asked about his blistering form in front of goal. \"It comes down to the team. We've been very solid defensively and then we have the quality up front,\" he said. \"It was again Jacob (Murphy) who assisted me today so I just tried to be in the right place to finish the attack.\" Asked about his partnership with Murphy, Isak said: \"We've found the connection in a good way. He gets into good positions and he seems to find me a lot which is positive for me and for the team as well.\" Advertisement Getty Images Newcastle goalscorer Anthony Gordon, speaking post-match to ITV, said: \"It's up there. We knew what type of game it would be, they're dominant at home. It was always going to be a smash-and-grab.\" When asked if team-mate Alexander Isak is the best striker in Europe, he continued: \"I think so. Everyone is in agreement with that. He's on fire. Even for my goal. I'm just gambling back post. \"It's all about attitude. It was unbelievable to a man. I want to mention Dan Burn, he's been our player of the season for me. \"We don't have time to be celebrating this one. They're one of the best sides in Europe, it's only 2-0. We need to stay humble.\" Getty Images Another monumental defensive performance from Eddie Howe's side. They are making quite the habit of keeping out their opponents — that is the fifth clean they have recorded in their last seven matches in all competitions. Only Yoane Wissa and Dominic Solanke (once each) have scored against Newcastle in that run of fixtures. It was a great all-around team performance from Newcastle. No real weak links. Goalkeeper Martin Dubravka was solid and strong when called upon in potentially his final game for the club. The full-backs, young and English, were good, especially Lewis Hall, who should be right in England contention. The centre-halves, led by Dan Burn, massive. Botman was good on his second match back from injury too. In midfield, Joelinton threw himself around with abandon, while Sandro Tonali was a colossus. Great clinical finishing and pressing from Isak and Gordon up front too, while Jacob Murphy is smart and underrated. The subs did their job too. Getty Images That is a really damaging result for Arsenal and Mikel Arteta. He has done a lot of good work during his time as manager at the Emirates, but his lack of silverware is hindering his chance of building a real legacy. He may well mastermind a second-leg turnaround, but tonight feels particularly damaging for the Spaniard. He could be staring another trophy-less season in the face... Getty Images That is among the most impressive of all Newcastle United wins during Eddie Howe's already extremely successful tenure. This not only marks seven successive wins in all competitions, but the last three of them have been achieved on the road at testing grounds. Arsenal missed some big chances, but Newcastle were excellent during the first half, efficient in front of goal and defensively resolute. A two-goal lead is an unexpected, and also a healthy, one to take back to St James' Park for next month's second leg. Newcastle's players were understandably muted afterwards, seemingly holding themselves back, recognising this is only 'half-time' in the tie. Regardless, this result is huge. There is no other way of describing it. Advertisement The Athletic's Chris Waugh and Art de Roche were on hand to deliver The Briefing from the Emirates Stadium — you can read it at the link below. GO FURTHER Arsenal 0 Newcastle 2 – Eddie Howe’s greatest feat yet? What next for Arsenal? That's seven wins on the spin for Newcastle. And eight matches successively in which Alexander Isak has scored. What a player! And what brilliant form Eddie Howe's men are in. Getty Images Put simply, that is a monumental win for Newcastle. They arrived at the Emirates Stadium in very good form, but there won't be too many of their fans who expected to see them come away from north London with a 2-0 first-leg win. Yes, Arsenal missed a host of big chances, but that was a seriously impressive display from Eddie Howe's men, particularly when they dropped in to protect their 2-0 lead. A huge result to take up north for next month's second leg!",

                "content": "Newcastle United took one step closer to the Wembley with a superb 2-0 victory over Arsenal in the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final at the Emirates Stadium. Eddie Howe named an attacking line-up for the Magpies and they showed their intent from the start with a high press and a willingness to get men into the final third when in possession. Their early dominance threatened to be a false dawn though as Arsenal swiftly played through them to set Gabriel Martinelli up with a brilliant chance to open the scoring only for the winger to strike the post. Alexander Isak was more clinical at the other end. He ran onto the end of a Jacob Murphy pass to slot past David Raya and give Newcastle the lead before half-time. After the restart, Anthony Gordon arrived in the box at the right time as Isak had another shot stopped by Raya only for the goalkeeper to serve up an easy tap-in to Gordon. Howe then made changes and set the team up defensively. Arsenal threw everything at them but couldn’t cut the deficit and will have a tough task ahead of the return leg at St. James’ Park.

Our mentality to defend our goal with the blocked shots, the heroic pieces of defending that we saw in the last 20 to 30 minutes, it’s great for us for the future.” 22:31 , Mike Jones A night that was about whether you could take your chances; for goals, and maybe for finals. The overly cynical might even say it was for showing what you can really do in front of a certain audience, especially in regards to Alexander Isak. Arsenal’s widely reported interest in the Swede added another strand to a narrative-rich Carabao Cup semi-final, and his presence ended up deciding how this 2-0 win went. Newcastle United would rightly bristle at that being the focus of a match that might end up sending them to Wembley for the second time in three years. Arsenal do still have a second leg in a month to overturn this, but that will be at an intimidating St James Park, where the crowd will see this trophy as being about so much more than this trophy. The Saudi Arabian project has felt like it has needed a lift after a long lull, and this might be it. For all that recent issues had fed a debate over whether the controversial ownership are overseeing the club in the fulsome manner they have other projects, their willingness to spend what they can has given Newcastle one of the finest players in world football right now. Alexander Isak’s ruthlessness reveals where Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal must improve 22:31 , Mike Jones “Very pleased with the players, it was a tough game for us in many respects. We’ve had players struggling at half-time. Really pleased with how we played.” 22:24 , Mike Jones “Very proud, it was always going to be like that in the second half. Too a man everyone defended brilliant. “To get a result here you need to defend set-pieces, but I thought everyone was brilliant. “We have had a sticky patch, but we have had a few clean sheets in a row. Seeing the way we defended in the second half was brilliant. “It’s only a job half done - they have nothing to lose coming to St. James’ Park.” 22:21 , Mike Jones “I think it comes down to a team thing. “We have been solid defensively and then we have the quality up front. Jacob [Murphy] assisted me and I tried to be in the right place to finish the attacks. “We came here with the intention to bring a good result home and we did. “We have some time to change things, come back and do the same at St. James’ Park.” 22:18 , Mike Jones “We weren’t doing it at the start of the season and we weren’t putting work in at the start of the season. We don’t have time to celebrating this one. “They’re one of the best sides in Europe, it’s only 2-0. We need to stay humble.” 22:15 , Mike Jones “It’s up there. We knew what type of game it would be, they’re dominant at home. It was always going to be a smash-and-grab. “I think so. I think everyone is in agreement with that. He’s [Alexander Isak] on fire. Even for my goal. I’m just gambling back post. It’s all about attitude. It was unbelievable to a man. I want to mention Dan Burn, he’s been our player of the season for me.” 22:12 , Mike Jones Since 1987-88, this is the ninth time an away team will have held a two-goal advantage after a semi-final first leg, with all eight previous occasions seeing the side progress to the final. 22:02 , Mike Jones 21:57 , Mike Jones Newcastle took one step closer to the Wembley with a superb 2-0 victory over Arsenal in the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final at the Emirates Stadium. Eddie Howe named an attacking line-up for the Magpies and they showed their intent from the start with a high press and a willingness to get men into the final third when in possession.

Arsenal threw everything at them but couldn’t cut the deficit and will have a tough task ahead of the return leg at St. James’ Park. 21:54 , Mike Jones 90+5 mins: The full-time whistle goes. Alexander Isak and Anthony Gordon’s goals give Newcastle a two-goal cushion. It’s a seventh successive win for Newcastle and they are one step closer to the final at Wembley. 21:51 , Mike Jones 90+3 mins: Cross after cross comes into the box from both sides of the pitch but Newcastle’s centre-backs are holding firm. They’ve played more than half of the added time but still have work to do to get this result confirmed. 21:49 , Mike Jones 90 mins: Five minutes of added time to play. That seems like a lot, there haven’t been many stoppages in this this. Regardless it’s more than enough time for Arsenal to get their goal. Can they do it? 21:45 , Mike Jones 87 mins: Jorginho takes a shot from the edge of the box and curls a decent effort just wide of the far post. Arsenal are coming closer but they’ve yet to break through Newcastle’s defences. 21:42 , Mike Jones 84 mins: Martin Dubravka takes as long as it is possible before restarting the match from a goal kick. Newcastle are employing plenty of football’s dark arts to keep Arsenal at bay. Gabriel Jesus is punished for a nudge on Tonali. Free kick Newcastle. 21:38 , Mike Jones 81 mins: Jorginho chips a pass into the box and finds Kai Havertz. Havertz then dinks the ball into the six yard area on the stretch and hopes to find Gabriel Jesus but only ends up giving the ball to Maritn Dubravka. 21:36 , Mike Jones 78 mins: Newcastle are content with their cushion. They’re are fully focused on making sure Arsenal don’t score meaning there’s an edge to the end of this game. The Gunners are playing entirely in Newcastle’s half now. 21:33 , Mike Jones 75 mins: 15 minutes to play and Arsenal are pressing intently. Lewis Hall does well to evade a couple of tackles before Joelinton wins a free kick with some fine hold up play. Anthony Gordon is now replaced with Miguel Almiron and Newcastle eke out a few more seconds. 21:30 , Mike Jones 72 mins: Newcastle’s main issue now is that there’s no way out for them when they’re trying to play out from the back. Arsenal are quicker and sharper and there’s still a long time left in this game. Arsenal will surely pull a goal back at this rate. Dubravka punches away another corner kick but Arsenal recover the ball immediately. 21:28 , Mike Jones 71 mins: A storming run from Declan Rice wins another corner for Arsenal. This cross is poor though and Rice hooks the ball straight into the side netting. There’s a nervous energy around the stadium as Arsenal search for a goal. Newcastle are now set up with five players in defence, four in midfield and Gordon alone in the front line. They’re holding on to what they’ve got. 21:26 , Mike Jones 68 mins: Howe’s changes mean Newcastle will be less adventrous. Anthony Gordon, who is on a yellow card, is now playing down the middle as the main target man. Martinelli receives the ball for Arsenal and attacks from the left. He squares a pass into the box but Hall boots it clear despite the danger being minimal. 21:23 , Mike Jones 66 mins: Eddie Howe reacts to Arteta’s changes with three of his own. Jacob Murphy, Joe Willock and Alexander Isak are taken off with Harvey Barnes, Sean Longstaff and Lloyd Kelly brought on. 21:22 , Mike Jones 64 mins: Joe Willock gets back and turns a pass behind for a corner. Declan Rice delivers the set piece and finds William Saliba at the back post this time. It’s another opportunity for Arsenal but Saliba nods it it over the top. 21:20 , Mike Jones 63 mins: Mikel Arteta has made a couple of changes. Leandro Trossard and Thomas Partey have been hooked off with Gabriel Jesus and Jorginho brought on. Can Arsenal find a way back into this match? 21:17 , Mike Jones 58 mins: Chance! Leandro Trossard comes down the right wing and sends a cross into the box. Lewis Hall half blocks it but the ball loops into the air and drops into the middle of the penalty area. Somehow, Kai Havertz is wide open but misses out on a header and the ball hits his shoulder and bounces wide of the target. 21:15 , Mike Jones 57 mins: Tonali lifts a cross into the Arsenal box and Raya flaps it away. The goalkeeper isn’t in control of the clearance but luckily the ball falls to an Arsenal defender who clears. There’s an urgency and erratic nature to Arsenal now. They need to pull something out of the hat. 21:13 , Mike Jones 54 mins: It could be a long way back from here for Arsenal. Even though the tie is played over two legs you feel they need a goal here at the very least to be in with a shout of overturning the deficit at St. James’ Park. The difficulty is overcommiting and conceding another. Three goals would be almost impossible to overturn. 21:10 , Mike Jones Massive moment! Six minutes into to the second half and Newcastle have a second goal. Alexander Isak steps out of the forward position and drops to receive the ball. He turns it to Jacob Murphy who takes the ball up to the edge of the box before slotting a pass back to Isak. Isak shoots and draws a leaping save out of David Raya who only manages to push the ball into the path of Anthony Gordon for a tap in. 21:05 , Mike Jones 48 mins: The first half was a blistering affair of end-to-end action. With Newcastle now in front expect that to change with Eddie Howe’s men preferring to stay more defensively secure. They’ll still want a second goal but will take less risks with their press I expect. 21:03 , Mike Jones Arsenal restart the match for the second half. Newcastle have never won a league cup tie against Arsenal but they are on the way to taking an advantage into the second leg. No changes at the break from either manager. 21:00 , Mike Jones Arsenal have had 14 shots in the first half with three on target. Newcastle have been more ruthless though with five attempts and two on target including Alexander Isak’s goal. Who will perform the better in the second half? 20:56 , Mike Jones 20:52 , Mike Jones Alexander Isak has the only goal for the game so far. Can Arsenal respond in the second half? Who else but Alexander Isak?Newcastle break the deadlock in North London! 💥 pic.twitter.com/Qv80CKvqAD — Sky Sports Football (@SkyFootball) January 7, 2025 20:47 , Mike Jones 45+2 mins: Newcastle attempt to get out from their own final third. Anthony Gordon crunches Leandro Trossard as the pair fight over the ball. The referee lets play go on and Alexander Isak wins Newcastle a throw in on the left wing. The whistle then goes for the break. 20:45 , Mike Jones 45 mins: Arsenal recycle the ball into the box and the ball drops lovely for Gabriel. He hooks a nice shot towards the target but hits the goalkeeper who didn’t know much about that one. Dubravka makes the save though. Two minutes added on at the end of the first half. 20:44 , Mike Jones 43 mins: Joelinton takes out Thomas Partey in a dangerous position for Newcastle. Right in front of goal with enough distance to get the ball up and down. Martin Odegaard and Leandro Trossard stand over the ball but it’s Odegaard who nails the shot straight into the wall. 20:40 , Mike Jones 40 mins: Declan Rice tries to immediately respond for Arsenal and probes at a gap in the Newcastle defence. He pulls the ball back into the middle of the box but only manages to give it to Martin Dubravka. 20:38 , Mike Jones Bang! Newcastle’s star man is the one to break the deadlock. Martin Dubravka fires a free kick up the pitch and looks to pick out Sven Botman. Botman tussles with William Saliba in the air and manages to glance the ball on to Jacob Murphy who nudges it forward. The ball bounces into the penalty area and Alexander Isak is the first to react. He sprints to the ball then smokes it past David Raya. Newcastle lead. 20:36 , Mike Jones 34 mins: A quick free kick from Newcastle is flicked forward towards Isak making another one of his cutting runs. The ball floats over his head and Timber collects for the Gunners before sending it along the back line for slow build up play from the defence. 20:33 , Mike Jones 31 mins: Another Arsenal set piece results in a wild scramble inside the Newcastle penalty area. Black and white shirts throw themselves in front of the ball and there’s no way through for the Gunners. Arsenal have wrestled the momentum in their favour and Newcastle need a response. 20:30 , Mike Jones 28 mins: POST! Arsenal should be in front. Newcastle step up the pitch but some quick passes between Rice and Trossard manages to send Gabriel Martinelli free in behind the back line. He carries the ball into the penalty area then blazes a shot towards the nearest post. He strikes it well and rattles the woodwork! 20:26 , Mike Jones 27 mins: Arsenal look to play out from the back and gets closed down inside his own penalty area. Jacob Murphy and Sandro Tonali pincer him but the youngster manages to dart through a gap with the ball and win a free kick to ease the pressure. Newcastle’s press has been very good tonight. 20:23 , Mike Jones 24 mins: Joe Willock gets back to help out the defence and deflects a Leandro Trossard cross behind for a corner. Martin Odegaard comes over to take this one and curls the set piece into the penalty area. Martin Dubravka comes off his line and punches the ball well clear in a confident sign for the Newcastl goalkeeper. 20:20 , Mike Jones 21 mins: The game has been pretty end-to-end over the opening 20 minutes and Arsenal are just trying to assert some control on proceedings and slow down the tempo. Martin Odegaard’s pass out wide is almost intercepted by Tino Livramento. The defender gets to the ball first but slides into Gabriel Martinelli with his follow through. The Arsenal winger winces in pain but seems okay to play on. 20:17 , Mike Jones 18 mins: You can’t help but feel as though Newcastle’s gameplan could backfire on them if Arsenal score first. Their commitment to fling men forward means there is plenty of space for Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard to run into. Sandro Tonali is just now realising that he’s in for a lot of work tonight sprinting back and forth in search of the ball. 20:16 , Mike Jones 16 mins: Isak darts across the pitch and collects a pass that comes down the right wing. He cuts the ball back into the box but Anthony Gordon overruns the pass. Behind him, Lewis Hall collects the ball and slips it across to Sandro Tonali who fizzes a shot from range over the top. 20:14 , Mike Jones 15 mins: Newcastle aren’t shy about getting men forward when they have the ball. It’s an attacking mindset that Eddie Howe has instilled in his players and it’s making Arsenal a little uncomfortable in this opening stages. It’s been a good start to this match but teams visibly want to win. 20:13 , Mike Jones 13 mins: Gabriel Martinelli dances into the box from the left and runs at Sven Botman. He manages to get a pass into the middle but Dan Burn is there to turn the ball behind for a corner. Declan Rice delivers again and picks out Jurrien Timber for a second time. Timber mistimes his jump and gets to the ball as he falls back to earth meaning his headed effort is sent over the top of the crossbar. 20:11 , Mike Jones 12 mins: Scramble! An Arsenal free kick is lofted into the box and Newcastle do okay to clear it. It comes to the edge of the box where Gabriel Martinelli brings the ball under control before drilling a shot at goal. His effort is deflected to William Saliba who tries the same thing. His shot gets through but a lunging Dan Burn stops Kai Havertz from turning it home. Martin Dubravka smothers the ball and the attack dies down. 20:09 , Mike Jones 9 mins: Arsenal are set up with Leandro Trossard on the right wing of the forward line. He doesn’t usually play here but in Bukayo Saka’s absence Mikel Arteta must feel as though Gabriel Martinelli is the more effective of the two on the left wing. 20:06 , Mike Jones 6 mins: Arsenal win their first set piece of the game. The Gunners have been incredible at scoring from set plays this season and this corner is sent into the box buy Declan Ric3e. He picks out Jurrien Timber but the defender’s header is directed wide of the target. 20:05 , Mike Jones 5 mins: Nearly! Arsenal’s centre-backs are asleep as a ball is played over the top for Alexander Isak. The striker makes a run in behind and keeps himself onside before touching the ball into the box. He pulls it back to Joelinton who attempts a first time shot on a bobbling pass. He doesn’t connect properly and lifts the effort over the crossbar. 20:03 , Mike Jones 3 mins: Arsenal look to control possession but a poor pass into midfield is intercepted. Newcastle send the ball to Alexander Isak who spins and releases it to Jacob Murphy arriving in the box from the right. Murphy shoots but his effort is blocked and the Gunners clear their lines. 20:01 , Mike Jones Newcastle get the ball rolling at the Emirates Stadium and work it over to the left wing. Joelinton is fed down the line and comes up against Jurrien Timber who manages to win a throw in for Arsenal. 19:55 , Mike Jones The players make their way out onto the pitch at the Emirates Stadium. The Newcastle fans are in full voice and have travelled a long way for this match. It’s only the first leg but both managers have picked strong teams with the aim to win the game. For Arsenal, Martin Odegaard returns and captains the team. He leads the players out on the pitch. Kick off is up next... 19:50 , Mike Jones Alexander Isak could become the first Magpies player to score against Arsenal in two different games in a single campaign since Laurent Robert in 2001/02. 19:45 , Mike Jones It’s a week where only four Premier League teams have double fixtures, so it consequently becomes a little double-edged. Although the Carabao Cup semi-final managers are at a stage of the season where their squads could badly do with time to breathe, the fact they are so close to Wembley means they feel they have little choice but to go all in. There’s a trophy to be won. That just means they lose a little bit of ground on, well, the training ground after the hectic December schedule. It’s perhaps just as well for Mikel Arteta and Arne Slot, in particular, that they have the FA Cup rather than Premier League at the weekend. We can expect some drastically changed sides. There should be a sadness to that but it does point to one of many contradictions in the modern game. Football has become so forensically systemised - to the point some call it “NFLisation” - and yet there’s so little actual time in the calendar for the elite teams to hone those systems. The cost of football’s packed schedule is a double-edged sword for players 19:40 , Mike Jones Gabriel Jesus has been involved in 13 goals in his last nine starts in the League Cup (11 goals, 2 assists). 19:35 , Mike Jones Newcastle captain Bruno Guimaraes misses tonight’s match due to a suspension for picking up too many yellow cards in the previous rounds. The Magpies boss, Eddie Howe, spoke about what it’ll be like to play without his talisman and said: “It’s a big blow. One of Bruno’s biggest strengths is he is always there for you. “His record has been brilliant for us especially when you consider the physical exertion that he commits to every game. “His training is very good and he’s been exceptional in every way so to lose him, and he’s a pivotal figure for us, is going to be a big miss but we have good players that can fill his shoes as well so, whoever I choose in that position, I have a lot of quality players.” 19:30 , Mike Jones This is only Newcastle’s third appearance in the League Cup semi-finals, but they’ve progressed to the final in each of the previous two (1975/76 vs Tottenham, 2022/23 vs Southampton). 19:25 , Mike Jones Eddie Howe has praised the extraordinary effort of Newcastle defender Sven Botman after he marked his eagerly-anticipated return with a strong display in a 2-1 win at Tottenham. Fabian Schar’s suspension meant Botman was thrust into the Magpies line-up to make his first competitive appearance since March following anterior cruciate ligament damage. Eddie Howe heaps praise on Sven Botman after return from injury at Tottenham 19:20 , Mike Jones Arsenal have scored 11 goals in their three League Cup matches this season, netting at least three each time. They’ve never scored 3+ goals in four consecutive games in the competition. 19:15 , Mike Jones Mikel Arteta believes his players are learning to adapt to different situations and positions as he attempts to limit the negative affect of long-term injuries on his squad. The Arsenal manager said: “We discussed the situation and the fact that we have to use players in positions that they probably haven’t played in before. “We are learning a lot from that and what I learn especially is the willingness of the team; you speak to any individual and ask him to play anywhere on the field and they say: ‘I’m there’. That’s great as well to learn from your players. “It’s a good learning process, not only tactically but also preparation and training with very few players. Today we had seven or eight players with us just to fill the squad which isn’t normal but it’s a weird way to learn, but I’ll take it. “I cannot change it so let’s take the things that we can get out of it to be better.” 19:10 , Mike Jones The Arsenal boss says that Newcastle’s in-form striker is a ‘top-player’ and that his team will attempt to minimise his impact this evening. Arteta said: “He’s a top player in top form scoring a lot of goals and we try to minimise the strength of the opposition. That’s a big part of the plan when we’re playing any opponent.” 19:03 , Mike Jones Arsenal XI: Raya; Timber, Saliba, Gabriel, Lewis-Skelly; Rice, Partey, Odegaard; Martinelli, Havertz, Trossard 🔴 𝗧𝗘𝗔𝗠𝙉𝙀𝙒𝙎 ⚪️🔙 Timber returns from suspension🪄 Trossard on the wing🙌 Havertz leads the lineLet's show our character, Gunners ✊ — Arsenal (@Arsenal) January 7, 2025 19:02 , Mike Jones Newcastle XI: Dubravka; Livramento, Botman, Burn, Hall; Willock, Tonali, Joelinton; Murphy, Isak, Gordon. HOWAY THE LADS! ✊ pic.twitter.com/RYeRuXfJ6S — Newcastle United (@NUFC) January 7, 2025 18:55 , Mike Jones Newcastle boss Eddie Howe does not care what people outside of the city think of his team as he plots another assault on Carabao Cup glory. The Magpies have climbed to fifth in the Premier League after a run of five successive victories, two of them at Manchester United and Tottenham, to rekindle memories of their surge into the Champions League places two seasons ago. Gunners boss Mikel Arteta and then Liverpool counterpart Jurgen Klopp were angered by Newcastle’s approach during that campaign, prompting Howe to say: “We are not here to be popular and to get other teams to like us. We are here to compete.” Eddie Howe hits back at critics of Newcastle’s approach: ‘We are here to win’ 18:50 , Mike Jones Arsenal have progressed from three of their last five League Cup semi-final ties. However, they haven’t won the first leg in any of their last seven semi-finals in the competition. Can Newcastle take advantage of that tonight? 18:46 , Mike Jones Arsenal have won all four of their League Cup meetings with Newcastle, scoring 12 goals and conceding none. The last such match was a 4-0 win at St James’ Park in the 2010/11 fourth round. 18:40 , Mike Jones Here’s Eddie Howe chatting about the fitness of Newcastle defender Sven Botman who has recently returned from injury: “He feels good. Naturally, a little bit of fatigue at the end of the game [versus Spurs] but I think, with Sven, it was a long absence but he’s trained for a long, long time for this moment. “After the Aston Villa game, he was cleared to play but we wanted to give him longer to try and reach his best physical levels. It is not like he has been rushed back. Straight into action, he did very well, (I was) really pleased with him and he handled the intensity well.” 18:35 , Mike Jones The Newcastle manager knows how important these next two games will be for his team and hopes his players are ‘at their absolute best’ when they take on Arsenal tonight. Howe said: “This is an important game for us. We need to be at our absolute best, a high-level game. There is a lot at stake for us. “We’ve got to be really good off the ball and solid defensively. We’ve got to cause Arsenal problems the other way. I don’t think we should overthink it, we just need to get that mix right. “Let’s try and continue the good performances we’ve given recently and try and win the game.” 18:30 , Mike Jones Ahead of the game the Arsenal boss said: “We’re very excited to play the game in front of our crowd. “A semi-final, an opportunity to earn the right to be in a final and that starts tomorrow with two legs. Obviously they’re going to be two long games against a very competitive team, we know that, but very excited and we need a big, big atmosphere in our stadium. “The way we can feel at the Emirates with our people is incredible and I’m very positive that tomorrow we’re going to create a big one against really good opposition in the semi-final of the cup that we want to win, so let’s go for it.” 18:25 , Mike Jones Arsenal host Newcastle in the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final on Tuesday night, with both sides looking to take what could be a vital advantage to St James’ Park (8pm, Sky Sports Main Event). The Gunners remain firmly in the Premier League title race after the weekend’s results, but attention turns to the first cup competition of the season as Mikel Arteta’s side hunt a first major trophy since 2020. Arsenal will know how difficult a second leg at St James’ could be, having lost there already this season, and will be desperate to take a lead of any kind to Tyneside, but they face a Newcastle team that has been in fine form in recent weeks, having won their last six matches in all competitions. Arsenal vs Newcastle prediction: Semi-final stalemate 18:20 , Mike Jones Referees will make in-stadium announcements on the outcome of VAR reviews in the remainder of this season’s Carabao Cup, marking a first for English football. The EFL confirmed last month that VAR will be in use for the competition’s two-leg semi-finals and for the final at Wembley on 16 March. However, the most significant move will be a pilot allowing referees to announce the final outcome of VAR reviews to spectators in the stadium and viewers watching at home. This will include decisions reviewed by the referee at the pitchside monitor, or upon the conclusion of factual matters such as accidental handball by a goalscorer or offside judgements. 18:15 , Mike Jones Here’s the team that will take to the field to officiate tonight’s semi-final first leg. Craig Pawson is in charge on the pitch and will referee the game while John Brooks is the VAR overseeing the new rules for the match. Referee: Craig PawsonAssistants: Ian Hussin, Wade SmithFourth official: Tony HarringtonVAR: John Brooks 18:10 , Mike Jones Arsenal suffered another selection setback after teen sensation Ethan Nwaneri was ruled out for the rest of the month on the eve of their Carabao Cup semi-final against Newcastle. The 17-year-old marked his second successive Premier League start by opening the scoring in Saturday’s 1-1 draw at Brighton before being withdrawn at half-time. Nwaneri was handed his chance as a result of injuries to Bukayo Saka, who is expected to be sidelined until March, and Raheem Sterling. But manager Mikel Arteta now faces being without the teenager for the entirety of January, with Tuesday’s first leg against the Magpies the first of seven fixtures to come during the remainder of the month. 18:05 , Mike Jones Arsenal have been dealt another injury blow with young star Ethan Nwaneri facing a spell on the sidelines. The 17-year-old has impressed of late having been handed an opportunity in the starting side after Bukayo Saka’s hamstring issue. But the teenager sustained a muscular problem in the weekend draw at Brighton and now faces time out. Arsenal suffer another injury blow with young star set for spell on sidelines 18:00 , Mike Jones Arsenal have been struggling for goals in recent weeks, while Newcastle have six wins on the bounce having scored 18 goals across those games. The Magpies will come up against one of the toughest defences in the country, but they’ll be confident of taking a result back to St James’ Park. Arsenal 1-1 Newcastle United. 17:55 , Mike Jones For Newcastle, Sven Botman made his return at the weekend, though he was forced off and so will likely not be risked in this match, with Lewis Kelly potentially coming in. The rest of the line-up will likely remain the same as it was for the win over Spurs, with Harvey Barnes and Joe Willock also fighting for a place. Predicted Newcastle XI: Dubravka; Livramento, Kelly, Burn, Hall; Guimaraes, Tonali, Joelinton; Murphy, Isak, Gordon. 17:50 , Mike Jones Arsenal have no new injury concerns after the draw with Brighton, though they can expect Kai Havertz back into the squad after he was out ill. In addition, Martin Odegaard and Gabriel Martinelli could return to the starting 11 after being on the bench at the weekend. The midfield will likely stay similar to the trio used against Brighton, though Merino could drop out for Odegaard, and the defence will likely be the same too, with Riccardo Calafiori keeping his place ahead of Miles Lewis-Skelly. Predicted Arsenal XI: Raya; Partey, Gabriel, Saliba, Calafiori; Odegaard, Jorginho, Rice; Martinelli, Jesus, Trossard. 17:45 , Mike Jones Viewers in the United Kingdom have a couple of options for watching the match, as it will be shown live on both ITV1 and Sky Sports Main Event and Sky Sports Premier League.

Mikel Arteta’s side have been struggling for goals in recent weeks, with a disappointing draw with Brighton last time out meaning they’re now eight points adrift in the Premier League, but this competition provides a chance at some much-needed early silverware for the Gunners. And though Newcastle have been flying high in recent weeks, with six wins on the bounce, their well-publicised trophy drought means that another final in this tournament is arguably more important for Eddie Howe’s side. The Magpies last won a major trophy in 1955, when they won the FA Cup, and a win tonight would put one foot in their second Carabao Cup final in three seasons. 17:30 , Mike Jones Welcome to The Independent’s coverage of tonight’s Carabao Cup action as Arsenal host Newcastle in the first leg of tonight’s semi-final. The Gunners are in decent form having gone 13 matches unbeaten across all competitions while Newcastle are on a six-match winning run. The winner of tonight’s encounter will take an advantage into the next leg in February and will be one step closer to the final at Wembley. We’ll have all the team news, line-ups and more throughout the evening so stick with us as we build up to kick off at 8pm.",

                "content": "Ripping brush fires erupted Tuesday in Southern California amid punishing wind gusts, prompting evacuation orders in multiple zones. The wildfires were initially estimated to engulf around 200 acres, but officials later said the flames had spread to more than 1,261 acres. Evacuation orders were first issued for one zone, shown below in red, as Los Angeles officials warned of an \"immediate threat to life.\" Through the afternoon, officials issued evacuation orders for several more zones as firefighters worked to contain the blaze. By 5:32 p.m. ET Tuesday, the fire had spread from 200 acres to more than 771. By 7:33 p.m. ET, the blaze had spread to 1,261.5 acres. A massive amount of firefighting resources were quickly deployed to contain the blaze, and at one point, there were nearly a dozen planes attacking the wildfire. The mayor's office said that around 140 Los Angeles Police Department officials have been assigned to help with traffic gridlock and evacuations. An evacuation order is issued when there is an \"immediate threat to life\" in an area, city officials said, adding that \"this is a lawful order to LEAVE NOW.\" As of Tuesday afternoon, the following zones were under full evacuation orders: The following zones were placed under evacuation warnings, as officials said there was a \"potential threat to life and/or property\" and that \"those who require additional time to evacuate, and those with pets and livestock should leave now\": The National Weather Service issued a rare red flag warning for the fire, indicating \"warm temperatures, very low humidities, and stronger winds that can combine to produce an increased risk of fire danger.\" The blaze was exacerbated by intense winds, and one meteorologist warned the Palisades fire was a \"near worst-case scenario\" as gusts swept the blaze into multiple neighborhoods. Some gusts could reach up to 100 mph, which is equivalent to the strength of a Category 2 hurricane. It's not yet clear what caused the fire. Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) Public Information Officer Erik Scott said on X: \"We want evacuees to head Southbound on Palisades Drive to Westbound Sunset Blvd. to Southbound Pacific Coast Highway.\" Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass issued a statement saying the LAFD had prepared for high winds: They \"pre-deployed strike teams in and near areas prone to wildfire. Firefighters are now actively and aggressively responding to the #PalisadesFire with support from regional partners.\" California is under a high wind warning until at least 7 a.m. local time on Wednesday. The NWS said there is an extreme risk of fire weather conditions and officials said the event will \"likely be the most destructive windstorm seen since 2011.\" Sonam Sheth is an Evening Politics Editor at Newsweek who is based in New York.

                "title": "Sutton Foster - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Sutton Lenore Foster (born March 18, 1975) is an American actress. She is known for her work on the Broadway stage, for which she has won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical twice, in 2002 for her role as Millie Dillmount in Thoroughly Modern Millie, and in 2011 for her performance as Reno Sweeney in Anything Goes, a role which she reprised in 2021 for a production in London and for which she received a nomination for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical. Her other Broadway credits include Grease, Little Women, The Drowsy Chaperone, Young Frankenstein, Shrek the Musical, Violet, The Music Man, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, and Once Upon a Mattress. On television, Foster played the lead role in the short-lived ABC Family comedy-drama Bunheads from 2012 to 2013. From 2015 to 2021, she starred in the TV Land comedy-drama Younger. Foster was born on March 18, 1975[1][2] in Statesboro, Georgia,[3] and raised in Troy, Michigan.[4] At the age of 15, she was a contestant on the reality competition show Star Search[4][5] and also auditioned for the cast of The Mickey Mouse Club. She left Troy High School before graduating (she received her diploma via correspondence courses) to join the national tour of The Will Rogers Follies directed by Tommy Tune.[4][6][7] She then attended Carnegie Mellon University for one year,[7][8] but left to pursue a theatrical career full-time. In May 2012, she received an honorary doctorate from Ball State University, \"in recognition of her outstanding career in theater, television and music and for her contributions to the educational experience and professional growth of Ball State students.\"[9] In May 2019, she also received an honorary doctorate from Boston Conservatory at Berklee, which introduced a merit scholarship in her name to be awarded to one student every four years. Her older brother, Hunter Foster, is also an actor.[4][7] After touring in the role of Sandy Dumbrowski in the musical Grease throughout 1995, Foster transferred to the Broadway production in 1996.[10][11] She left to appear in the ensemble of the Broadway musical The Scarlet Pimpernel in 1997, and after that closed[12] she returned as the Star to Be in the revival of Annie. In 1998, Foster appeared in What the World Needs Now at the Old Globe Theatre, before she began touring with Les Misérables as Eponine Thenardier. She then understudied the same role on Broadway in 2000.[13] Foster left Les Misérables to join the ensemble of Thoroughly Modern Millie in its pre-Broadway run at the La Jolla Playhouse. Original leading lady Kristin Chenoweth landed a television series shortly after rehearsals began and was replaced with Erin Dilly as Millie and Foster as her understudy. After apparent clashes between the creative team, a \"mutual\" decision was made for Dilly to leave the production. With only nine days remaining before the first preview, Foster took over the role of Millie Dilmount.[14][15] During a hiatus (before Millie was set to open on Broadway), Foster appeared in Dorian at Goodspeed Musicals, The Three Musketeers at the American Musical Theatre of San Jose, and South Pacific at the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera.[citation needed] Thoroughly Modern Millie finally opened on Broadway at the Marquis Theatre in 2002, to positive reviews. The New York Daily News reviewer said: \"newcomer Sutton Foster, who has the pert look, the silver voice and the dazzling legwork to make an extraordinarily winning Millie.\"[16] Clive Barnes, reviewing for the New York Post wrote \"Newcomer Sutton Foster's own star turn as Millie is perfectly charming, but as a star she doesn't twinkle, glitter or light up Broadway like a Christmas tree defying a July noon. But she has a good voice and is cutely agreeable.\"[17] The Newsday reviewer wrote: \"She has a smile that may remind you of Mary Tyler Moore, the gawky comic precision of the young Carol Burnett, the lyricism of a romantic heroine and a smallish but vibrant voice as accurate as it is expressive. As [Millie], another of New York's prototypical small-town girls with big-city dreams, [Sutton Foster] appears unfazed by the burden of a character created onscreen by Julie Andrews. The newcomer takes the big stage with an uninhibited what-the-heck comfort level and the discipline to go with her instincts.\"[18] Time Magazine wrote: \"she's [Sutton Foster] got the full package: girlish gawkiness and Broadway brass, the legs and the lungs. Foster is a big reason the show is just about the cutest thing to hit Broadway since Annie's dimples, with perkily retro songs by Jeanine Tesori and clever staging by director Michael Mayer...\"[19] Foster went on to win the 2002 Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical,[20] the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actress in a Musical,[21] and the Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Actress in a Musical for her performance.[22][23] During the run, Foster appeared in concert versions of Chess and Funny Girl, before leaving in 2004. Upon leaving, Foster did a concert version of Snoopy! The Musical and returned to the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera for a production of Me and My Girl to wrap up the year. In May 2005, Foster co-starred as Jo March opposite Maureen McGovern as Marmee in the musical adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's classic novel Little Women, for which she was nominated for her second Tony Award.[24] The production closed after just a few months. She returned to Broadway at the Marquis Theatre in May 2006 in The Drowsy Chaperone, a spoof of 1920s musicals. She played Janet van de Graaff, a famous Broadway starlet who opts to forgo a stage career in favor of married life. The musical had a pre-Broadway run at the Ahmanson Theatre, Los Angeles in November to December 2005.[25] Her performance earned her a third Tony nomination.[26] Foster left the musical in 2007 and co-starred in Mel Brooks' musical adaptation of his film Young Frankenstein as the Swedish yodeling fräulein Inga, first at the Paramount Theatre and then on Broadway from October 2007 to July 2008.[27] In 2007, Foster guest-starred on the children's musical puppet show Johnny and the Sprites[28] and in a three-episode story arc on the HBO sitcom Flight of the Conchords.[29] She left the show to play Princess Fiona in Shrek the Musical, which opened on Broadway on December 14, 2008.[30] For this role, Foster won her second Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Actress in a Musical[31] and was nominated for her fourth Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical.[32] She played her final performance on January 3, 2010, when the show closed on Broadway.

Lynch Theater, John Jay College, New York. The full cast included Efé, Kaitlyn Davidson, Alex Ellis, Maynard, Matt Loehr, and Jesse Nager, and was directed by Denis Jones.[38] Foster taught a Spring Semester master class at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts Undergraduate Department of Drama, beginning in January 2010. It culminated in a cabaret performance at Joe's Pub in May titled \"From Rodgers To Heart\".[39][40] She taught the master class again in Fall Semester 2010, culminating in another performance at Joe's Pub, \"Crazy for Gershwin\". Both were musically directed by Deborah Abramson. She is now on the faculty of NYU's New Studio on Broadway. Foster taught a week-long master class session at Ball State University (Muncie, IN) in January 2010.[33] She continued her relationship with Ball State in September 2010 by working with students in the classroom, teaching master classes, and performing workshops for students of the Department of Theatre and Dance. She also guest-starred in an episode of the NBC legal drama Law & Order: SVU (opposite comedian Kathy Griffin), which aired on March 3, 2010.[41] Foster performed at the 33rd Annual Kennedy Center Honors in a tribute to Jerry Herman, singing \"Before the Parade Passes By.\"[42] She performed at the Kennedy Center Honors the following year in a tribute to Barbara Cook.[43] She made a third appearance at the Kennedy Center Honors in 2013, performing for the tribute to Shirley MacLaine.[44] Foster performed a concert tour, An Evening With Sutton Foster from September 2010 to May 2011, performing songs from both her Broadway career and her solo album.[45] Foster played Reno Sweeney in the Broadway revival of Anything Goes, which began performances on March 10, 2011, at the Stephen Sondheim Theatre and officially opened on April 7, 2011.[46] Foster won her third Outer Critics Circle Award and second Drama Desk Award and Tony Award for her performance.[47][48][49] Foster's final performance was on March 11, 2012, when she was replaced by Stephanie J. Block. Foster left to film the television comedy-drama Bunheads, which premiered on ABC Family on June 11, 2012.[50][51] Foster played the lead role in this short-lived 2012 ABC Family drama, developed by Amy Sherman-Palladino, the creator of Gilmore Girls. She played former Las Vegas showgirl Michelle, who impulsively marries a man, moves to his small town, and begins teaching ballet lessons at her new mother-in-law's dance studio. She won the Gracie Award and received a nomination at the 3rd Critics' Choice Television Awards for Best Actress in a Comedy Series.[52] The series was cancelled after a single season.[53] In the spring of 2012, she returned to Ball State, teaching classes, mentoring the interdisciplinary team that wrote the musical The Circus in Winter, and co-directing the Department of Theatre and Dance's Spring 2012 production of The Drowsy Chaperone; she also spoke at commencement and received an Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts degree for her continued engagement with Ball State students.

                "title": "Gulf Coast of the United States - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Gulf Coast of the United States, also known as the Gulf South or the South Coast, is the coastline along the Southern United States where they meet the Gulf of Mexico. The coastal states that have a shoreline on the Gulf of Mexico are Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, and these are known as the Gulf States.[2] The economy of the Gulf Coast area is dominated by industries related to energy, petrochemicals, fishing, aerospace, agriculture, and tourism. The large cities of the region are (from west to east) Brownsville, Corpus Christi, Houston, Galveston, Beaumont, Lake Charles, Lafayette, Baton Rouge, New Orleans, Gulfport, Biloxi, Mobile, Pensacola, Panama City, St. Petersburg, and Tampa. All are the centers or major cities of their respective metropolitan areas and many of which contain large ports. The Gulf Coast is made of many inlets, bays, and lagoons. The coast is intersected by numerous rivers, the largest of which is the Mississippi River. Much of the land along the Gulf Coast is, or was, marshland.[3] Ringing the Gulf Coast is the Gulf Coastal Plain, which reaches from Southern Texas to the western Florida Panhandle, while the western portions of the Gulf Coast are made up of many barrier islands and peninsulas, including the 130-mile (210 km) Padre Island along the Texas coast. These landforms protect numerous bays and inlets providing as a barrier to oncoming waves. The central part of the Gulf Coast, from eastern Texas through Louisiana, consists primarily of marshland. The eastern part of the Gulf Coast, predominantly Florida, is dotted with many bays and inlets. The Gulf Coast climate is humid subtropical, although Southwest Florida features a tropical climate. Much of the year is warm to hot along the Gulf Coast, while the three winter months bring periods of cool (or rarely, cold) weather mixed with mild temperatures. The area is highly vulnerable to hurricanes as well as floods and severe thunderstorms. Much of the Gulf Coast has a summer precipitation maximum, with July or August commonly the wettest month due to the combination of frequent summer thunderstorms produced by relentless heat and humidity, and tropical weather systems, including tropical depressions, tropical storms, and hurricanes, while winter and early spring rainfall also can be heavy. This pattern is evident in southern cites as Houston, New Orleans, Mobile, Alabama, and Pensacola, Florida. However, the central and southern Florida peninsula and South Texas has a pronounced winter dry season, as at Tampa and Fort Myers. On the central and southern Texas coast, winter, early spring and mid-summer are markedly drier, and September is the wettest month on average at Corpus Christi and Brownsville, Texas. Tornadoes are infrequent at the coast but do occur; however, they occur more frequently in inland portions of Gulf Coast states. Over most of the Gulf Coast from Houston, Texas, eastward, extreme rainfall events are a significant threat, commonly from tropical weather systems, which can bring 4 to 10 or more inches of rain in a single day. In August 2017, Hurricane Harvey made landfall along the central Texas coast, then migrated to and stalled over the greater Houston area for several days, producing extreme, unprecedented rainfall totals of over 40 inches (1,000 mm) in many areas, unleashing widespread flooding. Climate scientists predict more hurricanes for Florida[4] and the Texas coastline in particular.[5] Earthquakes are extremely rare to the area, but a 6.0 earthquake in the Gulf of Mexico on September 10, 2006, could be felt from the cities of New Orleans to Tampa. Due to the release of greenhouse gas emissions, glaciers and ice sheets are melting and expanding the oceans. The United States coastlines are projected to rise 1 foot in three decades or between 10 and 12 inches on average by 2050.[6] The Gulf Coast will likely see the biggest change, with sea levels expected to rise between 14 and 18 inches. The Global and Regional Sea Level Rise Report predicted more frequent, major and destructive high tide flooding events along with taller storm surges by 2050 after scientists determined high tide flooding has been \"increasingly common\" over the past few years due to the rising sea levels.[6] The impacts are expected to be dramatic. Low-lying coastal areas are expected to experience multiple factors, including increased levels of flooding, accelerated erosion, loss of wetlands and low-lying terrestrial ecosystems, and seawater intrusion into freshwater sources. Rising sea level and erosion will also imperil critical habitats for many commercially important fisheries that depend on inshore waters for either permanent residence or nursery area.[7] In 2021 alone rising sea levels cost the United States approximately $2.6 billion in relief efforts and caused at least seven deaths.[6] By 2051, the cost of flood damage is expected to increase by 61%, or $32 billion.[8] The Gulf Coast is a major center of economic activity. The marshlands along the Louisiana and Texas coasts provide breeding grounds and nurseries for ocean life that drive the fishing and shrimping industries. The Port of South Louisiana (Metropolitan New Orleans in Laplace) and the Port of Houston are two of the ten busiest ports in the world by cargo volume.[9] As of 2004, seven of the top ten busiest ports in the U.S. are on the Gulf Coast.[10] The discovery of oil and gas deposits along the coast and offshore, combined with easy access to shipping, have made the Gulf Coast the heart of the U.S. petrochemical industry. The coast contains nearly 4,000 oil platforms. Besides the above, the region features other important industries including aerospace and biomedical research, as well as older industries such as agriculture and — especially since the development of the Gulf Coast beginning in the 1920s and the increase in wealth throughout the United States — tourism. Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita have destroyed a number of museums and archives in the Gulf Coast. In 2008 floods in Iowa destroyed the local Flood Museum which held materials from the Great Mississippi and Missouri Rivers Flood of 1993.[11] Before European settlers arrived in the region, the Gulf Coast was home to several pre-Columbian kingdoms which had extensive trade networks with empires such as the Aztecs and the Mississippi Mound Builders. Shark and alligator teeth and shells from the Gulf have been found as far north as Ohio, in the mounds of the Hopewell culture.[12] The first Europeans to settle the Gulf Coast were primarily the French and the Spanish. The Louisiana Purchase (1803), Adams–Onís Treaty (1819) and the Texas Revolution (1835–1836) made the Gulf Coast a part of the United States during the first half of the 19th century. As the U.S. population continued to expand its frontiers westward, the Gulf Coast was a natural magnet in the South providing access to shipping lanes and both national and international commerce. The development of sugar and cotton production (enabled by slavery) allowed the South to prosper. By the mid-19th century the city of New Orleans, being situated as a key to commerce on the Mississippi River and in the Gulf, had become the largest U.S. city not on the Atlantic seaboard and the fourth largest in the U.S. overall. Two major events were turning points in the earlier history of the Gulf Coast region. The first was the American Civil War, which caused severe damage to some economic sectors in the South, including the Gulf Coast. The second event was the Galveston Hurricane of 1900. At the end of the 19th century Galveston was, with New Orleans, one of the most developed cities in the region. The city had the third busiest port in the U.S.[13] and its financial district was known as the \"Wall Street of the South\".[14] Since then the Gulf Coast has been hit with numerous other hurricanes. On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast as a Category 3 hurricane. It was the most damaging storm in the history of the United States, causing upwards of $80 billion in damages, and leaving over 1,800 dead. Again in 2008, the Gulf Coast was struck by a catastrophic hurricane. Due to its immense size, Hurricane Ike caused devastation from the Louisiana coastline all the way to the Kenedy County, Texas, region near Corpus Christi.[15] In addition, Ike caused flooding and significant damage along the Mississippi coastline and the Florida Panhandle[16] Ike killed 112 people and left upwards of 300 people missing, never to be found.[17] Hurricane Ike was the third most damaging storm in the history of the United States, causing more than $25 billion[18] in damage along the coast, leaving hundreds of thousands of people homeless, and sparking the largest search-and-rescue operation in U.S. history.[19] Other than the hurricanes, the Gulf Coast has redeveloped dramatically over the course of the 20th century. The gulf coast is highly populated. The petrochemical industry, launched with the major discoveries of oil in Texas and spurred on by further discoveries in the Gulf waters, has been a vehicle for development in the central and western Gulf which has spawned development on a variety of fronts in these regions. Texas in particular has benefited tremendously from this industry over the course of the 20th century and economic diversification has made the state a magnet for population and home to more Fortune 500 companies than any other U.S. state. Florida has grown as well, driven to a great extent by its long established tourism industry but also by its position as a gateway to the Caribbean and Latin America. As of 2024, Texas and Florida are the second and third most populous states in the nation, respectively. Other areas of the Gulf Coast have benefited less, though economic development fueled by tourism has greatly increased property values along the coast, and is now a severe danger to the valuable but fragile ecosystems of the Gulf Coast. The following table lists the 11 largest core-based statistical areas along the Gulf Coast. International destinations",

He did not expect it to go anywhere, according to abcnews. Trump's announcement in favor of changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico came while he was talking about Mexico's problems. \"We have a massive deficit with Mexico, and we help Mexico a lot,\" Trump said. \"They're essentially run by the cartels, and can't let that happen. Mexico is really in trouble, a lot of trouble, very dangerous place. We're going to be changing, sort of the opposite of Biden, where he's closing everything up, essentially getting rid of $50 to $60 trillion worth of assets. \"Mexico has to stop allowing millions of people to pour into our country. They can stop them. \"We're approaching the dawn of America's golden age. It's going to be a golden age for America.\" The name, Gulf of Mexico, has been in use for more than four centuries, taking its name from the Native American city of \"Mexico.\" But there have been more than 30 variations for the body of water we know today — and watch anxiously during hurricane season — as the Gulf of Mexico. A 1584 map uses \"Mare de Nort\" or \"Sea of the North\" for the Gulf. Baptiste Boazio, the illustrator and map maker of Francis Drake's Caribbean cruise of attacks in the 1580s, used \"Gulf of Mexico\" on his map \"View of Entire Route of Sir Francis Drake's West Indian Voyage.\" A 1630 map called the body of water \"Gulf of New Spain.\" According to the United States Geological Survey, among the other names the Gulf of Mexico has been called include: Bay of Mexico Bay of Newe Spaine Golfo de Nueva España Le Golfe De La Nouvelle Espaigne Mar Di Florida Mexicanus Sinus The Gulf is Mexico is located in the southeastern United States. It's bordered by the United States to the north, six Mexican states to the west and Cuba to the southeast. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service it measures approximately 994 miles from east to west and 559 miles from north to south. States surrounding the gulf include: Florida Alabama Mississippi Louisiana Texas This story was updated to add new information.

                "content": "Estimated read time: 4-5 minutes PALM BEACH, Fla. — President-elect Donald Trump said Tuesday that he would move to try to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the \"Gulf of America,\" a name he said has a \"beautiful ring to it.\" It's his latest suggestion to redraw the map of the Western Hemisphere. Trump has repeatedly referred to Canada as the \"51st State,\" demanded that Denmark consider ceding Greenland, and called for Panama to return the Panama Canal. Since his first run for the White House in 2016, Trump has repeatedly clashed with Mexico over a number of issues, including border security and the imposition of tariffs on imported goods. He vowed then to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and make Mexico pay for it. The U.S. ultimately constructed or refurbished about 450 miles of wall during his first term. The Gulf of Mexico is often referred to as the United States' \"Third Coast\" due to its coastline across five southeastern states. Mexicans use a Spanish version of the same name for the gulf: \"El Golfo de México.\" Americans and Mexicans diverge on what to call another key body of water, the river that forms the border between Texas and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas. Americans call it the Rio Grande; Mexicans call it the Rio Bravo. The International Hydrographic Organization — of which both the United States and Mexico are members — works to ensure all the world's seas, oceans and navigable waters are surveyed and charted uniformly, and also names some of them. There are instances where countries refer to the same body of water or landmark by different names in their own documentation. It can be easier when a landmark or body of water is within a country's boundaries. In 2015, then-President Barack Obama approved an order from the Department of Interior to rename Mount McKinley — the highest peak in North America — to Denali, a move that Trump has also said he wants to reverse. Just after Trump's comments on Tuesday, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, of Georgia, said during an interview with podcaster Benny Johnson that she would direct her staff to draft legislation to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico, a move she said would take care of funding for new maps and administrative policy materials throughout the federal government. The body of water has been depicted with that name for more than four centuries, an original determination believed to have been taken from a Native American city of \"Mexico.\" In 2012, a member of the Mississippi Legislature proposed a bill to rename portions of the gulf that touch that state's beaches \"Gulf of America,\" a move the bill author later referred to as a \"joke.\" That bill, which was referred to a committee, did not pass. Two years earlier, comedian Stephen Colbert had joked on his show that, following the massive Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, it should be renamed \"Gulf of America\" because, \"We broke it; we bought it.\" There's a long-running dispute over the name of the Sea of Japan among Japan, North Korea, South Korea and Russia, with South Korea arguing that the current name wasn't commonly used until Korea was under Japanese rule. At an International Hydrographic Organization meeting in 2020, member states agreed on a plan to replace names with numerical identifiers and develop a new digital standard for modern geographic information systems. The Persian Gulf has been widely known by that name since the 16th century, although usage of \"Gulf\" and \"Arabian Gulf\" is dominant in many countries in the Middle East. The government of Iran threatened to sue Google in 2012 over the company's decision not to label the body of water at all on its maps. There have been other conversations about bodies of water, including from Trump's 2016 opponent. According to materials revealed by WikiLeaks in a hack of her campaign chairman's personal account, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2013 told an audience that, by China's logic that it claimed nearly the entirety of the South China Sea, then the U.S. after World War II could have labeled the Pacific Ocean the \"American Sea.\"",

                "content": "Peter Yarrow (May 31, 1938 – January 7, 2025) was an American singer and songwriter who found fame as a member of the 1960s folk trio Peter, Paul and Mary. Yarrow co-wrote (with Lenny Lipton) one of the group's best known hits, \"Puff, the Magic Dragon.\" He was also a political activist and supported causes that ranged from opposition to the Vietnam War to school anti-bullying programs. Yarrow was convicted in 1970 of \"taking improper liberties\" with a 14-year-old girl, for which he was pardoned in 1981 by the late President Jimmy Carter. Peter Yarrow was born in Manhattan, the son of Vera Wisebrode (née Vira Burtakoff) and Bernard Yarrow. His parents were educated Ukrainian Jewish immigrants, whose families had settled in Providence, Rhode Island. Bernard Yarrow (1899–1973) attended the Jagiellonian University (Kraków) and the Odesa University (Odesa) before emigrating to the United States in 1922, at age 23.[1] He anglicized his surname from Yaroshevitz to Yarrow, obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in 1925 from Columbia University, where he joined Phi Sigma Delta fraternity,[2] and graduated from Columbia Law School in 1928. He then maintained a private law practice in New York City until 1938, when he was appointed an assistant district attorney under the then-district attorney, Thomas E. Dewey. In 1944, he was recruited into the Office of Strategic Services, where he served with distinction.[3] After the war, Bernard joined Sullivan & Cromwell, the Dulles brothers' law firm.[4] He was a founding board member of the National Committee for a Free Europe, an anti-Communist organization. In 1952, he became a senior vice-president of the CIA-funded Radio Free Europe, an organization he helped found.[5] Yarrow's mother, Vera (1904–1991), who had come to America at age three, became a speech and drama teacher at New York's Julia Richman Education Complex for girls. She and Bernard divorced in 1943, when their son Peter was five, and Vera subsequently married Harold Wisebrode, the executive director of the Central Synagogue in Manhattan.[6] Bernard married his wartime London OSS partner Silvia Tim, and converted to Protestantism.[7] Peter spent the summers of 1951 and 1952 at Interlochen's Music camp. He graduated second in his class among male students from New York's High School of Music and Art, where he had studied painting and received a physics prize. He was accepted at Cornell University, where he began as a physics major but soon switched to psychology, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1959. Among his Cornell classmates were Lenny Lipton, Thomas Pynchon, Richard Fariña, and David Shetzline.[citation needed] Yarrow began singing in public during his last year at Cornell while participating in Harold Thompson's popular American Folk Literature course, colloquially known on campus as \"Romp-n-Stomp.\" The course was \"a highlight of late-1950s student life at Cornell,\" Yarrow later recalled, and singing and guitar-playing skills were prerequisites for enrollment.[8] Thompson would lecture on a given topic for 20 or 30 minutes and afterwards a student would sing songs related to his theme. The experience of performing before a large audience was thrilling for Yarrow, who discovered he loved it. He branched out to lead community sings on weekends. Upon graduation, Yarrow played in New York City folk clubs, appeared on the CBS television show Folk Sound USA, and performed at the Newport Folk Festival, where he met manager and musical impresario Albert Grossman.[9] One day, the two were at Israel Young's Folklore Center in Greenwich Village discussing Grossman's idea for a new group that would be \"an updated version of the Weavers for the baby-boom generation ... with the crossover appeal of The Kingston Trio.\" Yarrow noticed a picture of Mary Travers on the wall and asked Grossman who she was. \"That's Mary Travers,\" Grossman said. \"She'd be good if you could get her to work.\"[10] The lanky, blonde Kentucky-born Travers was well connected in Greenwich Village folk circles. While still a student at the progressive Elizabeth Irwin High School, she had been selected by Elizabeth Irwin's chorus leader, Robert De Cormier, to join the \"The Song Swappers\" trio in backing up Pete Seeger in the 1955 Folkways LP reissue of the Almanac Singers' The Talking Union and two other albums. In addition to performing twice with Seeger at Carnegie Hall, Travers had performed the role of a folksinger in The Next President, a short-lived Broadway play, starring satirist Mort Sahl, but she was known to be painfully introverted and loath to sing professionally.[11] To draw Travers out, Yarrow went to her apartment on MacDougal Street, across from the Gaslight Cafe, one of the principal folk clubs. They harmonized on 'Miner's Lifeguard,' a union song, and decided that their voices blended well. To fill out the trio, Travers suggested Noel Stookey, a friend doing folk music and stand-up comedy at the Gaslight. They chose the catchy \"Peter, Paul and Mary\" as the name for their group, since Noel Stookey's middle name was Paul, and rehearsed intensively for six months, touring outside New York before debuting in 1961 as a polished act at The Bitter End nightclub in Greenwich Village. There, the singers quickly developed a following and signed a contract with Warner Brothers.[11] Warner released Peter, Paul and Mary's \"Lemon Tree\" as a single in early 1962. The trio then released \"If I Had a Hammer,\" a 1949 song by Pete Seeger and Lee Hays, written to protest the imprisonment of Harlem City Councilman Benjamin J. Davis, Jr. under the Smith Act. \"If I had a Hammer\" garnered two Grammy Awards in 1962. The trio's first album, the eponymous Peter, Paul & Mary, remained in the Top 10 for ten months and in the Top 20 for two years; it sold more than two million copies. The group toured extensively and recorded numerous albums, both live and in the studio.[12][13] In June 1963, Peter, Paul and Mary released a 7\" single of \"Blowin' in the Wind\" by the then-relatively unknown Bob Dylan, who was also managed by Grossman. \"Blowin' in the Wind\" sold 300,000 copies in the first week of release; by August 17, it was number two on the Billboard pop chart, with sales exceeding one million copies. Yarrow recalled that when he told Dylan he would make more than $5,000 (equivalent to $50,000 in 2023[14]) from the publishing rights, Dylan was speechless.[15] On August 28, 1963, Peter, Paul and Mary appeared on stage with the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. at his historic March on Washington where their performance of \"Blowin' in the Wind\" established it as a civil rights anthem.[16] Their version also spent weeks on Billboard's easy listening chart. By 1964 the 26-year-old Yarrow had joined the Board of the Newport Folk Festival, where he had performed as an unknown just four years earlier.[17] Yarrow's songwriting helped to create some of Peter, Paul and Mary's best-known songs, including \"Puff, the Magic Dragon\", \"Day Is Done\", \"Light One Candle\", and \"The Great Mandala\". As a member of the trio, he earned a 1996 Emmy nomination for the Great Performances special LifeLines Live, a highly acclaimed celebration of folk music, with their musical mentors, contemporaries, and a new generation of singer-songwriters.[18] Yarrow was instrumental in founding the New Folks Concert series at both the Newport Folk Festival and the Kerrville Folk Festival.[19] His work at Kerrville has been called his \"most important achievement in this arena\".[20] Yarrow co-wrote and produced \"Torn Between Two Lovers\", a number one hit for Mary McGregor. He also produced three CBS TV specials based on \"Puff, the Magic Dragon,\" which earned an Emmy nomination for him. In 1978 Yarrow organized Survival Sunday, an antinuclear benefit, and after a period of separation, he was once again joined by Stookey and Travers.[21] Yarrow and his daughter, Bethany Yarrow, often performed together. Together with cellist Rufus Cappadocia, they formed the trio Peter, Bethany, and Rufus.[22] They released the CD Puff & Other Family Classics. In 2008, the musical special Peter, Bethany & Rufus: Spirit of Woodstock, featuring a live performance of the band, aired on public television.[23] Yarrow portrayed leftist intellectual Ira Mandelstam in the 2015 film While We're Young.[24][25] Yarrow had long been an activist for social and political causes. What he did was not always popular. According to The New York Times: As their fame grew, Peter, Paul and Mary mixed music with political and social activism. In 1963, the trio marched with Martin Luther King Jr. in Selma, Alabama, and Washington, D.C. The three participated in countless demonstrations against the war in Vietnam. They sang at the 1969 March on Washington, which Mr. Yarrow helped to organize. Though their activism provoked a steady stream of death threats, they were never harmed. \"But for years, I used to bite my fingernails on stage,\" [Mary] Travers says. \"There you are and look like the back porch light, and stare out at 12,000 or 15,000 people. Any one of whom could have had a gun.\"[26] In 2000, in an effort to combat school bullying, Yarrow helped start Operation Respect,[27] a nonprofit organization that brings to children, in schools and camps, a curriculum of tolerance and respect for each other's differences. The project began as a result of Yarrow and his daughter Bethany and his son Christopher having heard the song Don't Laugh at Me (written by Steve Seskin and Allen Shamblin) at the Kerrville Folk Festival.[28][29][30] In March 2008, Yarrow told Reuters: Operation Respect has been my main and all-consuming work for the past 10 years. My perception is that the kind of bullying, humiliation that goes on in children's schools leads to high rates of depression that was virtually unknown when I was young and the high suicide rate of teenagers which we know is almost inevitably caused by bullying or mean-spiritedness. It is a reflection of the role models that young people observe on TV shows like a lot of the reality shows. It is also part and parcel of the characteristics in the adult world of America.[31] Yarrow's leadership in the campaign to free Soviet Jewry inspired another generation. Of the song \"Light One Candle\", Rabbi Allison Bergman Vann wrote: Peter Yarrow's now famous song, which was written in 1983, became a defining song for my generation of high school and college students to become activists, to make the world a better place. I heard Peter Yarrow singing that song on the steps of the Capitol, in 1987, twenty years ago next week, during the march to free Soviet Jews. Listening to him sing, surrounded by literally thousands of like-minded individuals, I learned of my obligation to change the world; to engage in tikkun olam, repair of our broken world. And, during that incredible day, I knew that we could, indeed, change the world.[32][better source needed] In 2005, Yarrow performed in Ho Chi Minh City at a concert to benefit the Vietnam Association of Victims of Agent Orange; Yarrow pleaded with the Vietnamese for forgiveness of the United States.[33] Yarrow served on the board of directors of the Connecticut Hospice.[20][34][better source needed] On November 1, 2008, Yarrow performed across New York City for volunteers who worked for the presidential campaign of Senator Barack Obama.[35] On October 3, 2011, Yarrow, his son, and his daughter made an appearance at Zuccotti Park during the Occupy Wall Street protests, playing songs such as \"We Shall Not Be Moved\" and a variation of \"Puff the Magic Dragon\".[36][37] Yarrow was a member of Braver Angels.[38] On April 3, 2021, he participated in an online interfaith Passover Seder hosted by the organization. Yarrow cited Judaism as one of the roots of his liberal views.[39] While campaigning for 1968 presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy, Yarrow met McCarthy's niece, Mary Beth McCarthy, in Wisconsin. He was 31, she was 20.[40][41] They were married in October 1969[39] in Willmar, Minnesota. Paul Stookey wrote \"Wedding Song (There Is Love)\" as his gift for their wedding and first performed it at St. Mary's Church in Willmar. They had two children, son Christopher and daughter Bethany,[42][43] but later divorced.[44] At the time of Yarrow's death, it was revealed that he and Mary Beth remarried in 2022 and remained married until his death in 2025.[42][45] In December 2000, Yarrow's Larrivee acoustic guitar was stolen on an airplane flight. In early 2005, fans spotted the guitar on eBay. The FBI recovered it in Sunny Isles Beach, Florida, and returned it to Yarrow. He did not press charges, as the person from whom it was recovered was not the person who had stolen it.[46] Yarrow performed the world premiere of \"The Colonoscopy Song\" on the CBS early morning program The Early Show on March 9, 2010.[47] Yarrow acknowledged being an alcoholic, and sought treatment for the disease. He considered himself in recovery.[48] A longtime resident of New York City, Yarrow had also owned a vacation home in Telluride, Colorado. Yarrow's son, Christopher, is a visual artist who in the late 2000s owned an emporium in Portland, Oregon, named The Monkey & The Rat.[49] In 1970, Yarrow was convicted and served three months in prison for taking \"improper liberties\" with 14-year-old Barbara Winter. In August 1969, she had gone with her 17-year-old sister to Yarrow's hotel room in Washington, DC seeking an autograph. Winter stated that Yarrow answered the door naked and made her masturbate him until he ejaculated. Yarrow served three months of a 1–3 year prison sentence.[50][51][52][53][54] He apologized for the incident, saying that \"it was an era of real indiscretion and mistakes by categorically male performers. I was one of them. I got nailed. I was wrong. I'm sorry for it.\"[51] Yarrow was granted a presidential pardon by Jimmy Carter on January 19, 1981, the day before Carter's presidency ended.[50][51][55] For decades, Yarrow avoided mention of the assault, but by the early 2000s, it became a campaign issue for politicians he supports.[53][56][57] In 2004, U.S. Representative Martin Frost of Texas, a Democrat, canceled a fundraising appearance with Yarrow after his opponent ran a radio advertisement about Yarrow's offense;[53] in 2013, Republican politicians in New York called on Democratic congressional candidate Martha Robertson to cancel a scheduled fundraiser with Yarrow.[56][58] In 2019, he was disinvited from a folk music festival when the organizers were informed of his conviction.[59] In May 2021, The Washington Post wrote that \"[Yarrow's] pardon by Carter — perhaps the only one in U.S. history wiping away a conviction for a sexual offense against a child — escaped scrutiny when it happened. It was granted just hours before the American hostages in Iran were freed, which captured headlines for weeks.\" The same article details other allegations of sexual assault of minors made against Yarrow.[50] Yarrow died of bladder cancer on January 7, 2025, at his Upper West Side apartment, at the age of 86.[60] Yarrow received the Allard K. Lowenstein Award in 1982 for his \"remarkable efforts in advancing the causes of human rights, peace, and freedom\".[61] In 1995 the Miami Jewish Federation recognized Yarrow's continual efforts by awarding its Tikkun Olam Award for his part in helping to \"repair the world\".[61][62] Yarrow was awarded the Kate Wolf Memorial Award by the World Folk Music Association in 1993.[63] In 2003 a congressional resolution recognized Yarrow's achievements and those of Operation Respect.[39][64]",

                "content": "Known for his political songs as well as Puff, the Magic Dragon, the group’s co-songwriter died of bladder cancer Peter Yarrow, a vocalist with the US folk trio Peter, Paul and Mary, has died aged 86. The cause was bladder cancer, which Yarrow had been diagnosed with four years ago. Yarrow took lead vocals on Puff, the Magic Dragon, The Great Mandella and Day Is Done, songs he either wrote or co-wrote with Noel Paul Stookey. Stookey is the last surviving member of the group, as Mary Travers died in 2009. Stookey told the New York Times that Yarrow was his “creative, irrepressible, spontaneous and musical younger brother” whom he “grew to be grateful for, and to love, the mature-beyond-his-years wisdom and inspiring guidance he shared with me like an older brother. Perhaps Peter was both of the brothers I never had and I shall deeply miss both of him.” In their 1960s heyday, the group had six US Top 10 singles and one No 1, a cover of John Denver’s Leaving on a Jet Plane, as well as five Top 10 albums. They were also politically significant. In August 1963, the progressive trio joined the March on Washington and sang a cover of Bob Dylan’s Blowin’ in the Wind on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, which cemented the song’s legacy as an anthem of the civil rights movement. Yarrow’s songs were often political, telling the story of a war objector on hunger strike in The Great Mandella, from 1967, and suggesting to his son, on Day Is Done, that his generation could make a better world. In 1970, he was convicted and served three months in prison for “taking indecent liberties with a minor” after a 14-year-old, Barbara Winter, said that when she went to his hotel room in Washington DC in search of an autograph, he answered the door naked and made her touch him until he ejaculated. Yarrow was granted a presidential pardon by Jimmy Carter the day before Carter’s presidency ended in January 1981. In 2019, Yarrow’s planned performance at the Colorscape Chenango arts festival in New York state was cancelled owing to resurfaced awareness of the conviction. “I do not seek to minimise or excuse what I have done and I cannot adequately express my apologies and sorrow for the pain and injury I have caused,” he told the New York Times then. In 2021, Winter said she was not informed of the pardon before reading about it in the press. It felt “like you got sucker-punched in the gut”, she told the Washington Post, which said the pardon was “perhaps the only one in US history wiping away a conviction for a sexual offence against a child”, and noted that it had gone unnoticed at the time, being granted hours before US hostages in Iran were freed. Yarrow was born on 31 May 1938 to Ukrainian-Jewish immigrants who had settled in Providence, Rhode Island. He graduated from Cornell University with a degree in psychology in 1959. He began performing during his final year at Cornell, singing in response to lectures given by the folklorist Harold Thompson in his “Romp-n-Stomp” classes. After graduating, he performed in folk clubs in New York City. On the recommendation of manager Albert Grossman, whom he met after performing at the Newport folk festival in 1960, he met Travers to discuss forming a “Weavers for the baby-boom generation”; Travers suggested Stookey to round out the group. They gave their first NYC performance in 1961 and signed with Warner Brothers. Their first hit was a cover of If I Had a Hammer (The Hammer Song) by Pete Seeger, which reached No 10 in the US in 1962. That year they released their self-titled debut album, which spent 10 months in the US Top 10 and two years in the Top 20. A year later, the trio popularised Blowin’ in the Wind; Dylan was also managed by Grossman. They also released Puff, the Magic Dragon, which became a staple of children’s music – and was not, contrary to popular opinion, about marijuana but a loss of childhood innocence. Leaving on a Jet Plane was their final US Top 40 hit in 1969. A year later, as a result of Yarrow’s conviction, the group split to pursue solo careers, but reunited in 1972 to support the presidential campaign of the Democratic nominee George McGovern, and in 1978 to protest against nuclear energy, and for a reunion tour. The group reunited for good in 1981. Travers died in 2009 of complications from chemotherapy while being treated for leukaemia. In Yarrow’s later years, he would also perform with his daughter, Bethany Yarrow, and cellist Rufus Cappadocia, as Peter, Bethany and Rufus. In 2011 he performed with Bethany and his son, Christopher, at an Occupy Wall Street demonstration, performing Puff and We Shall Not Be Moved. Yarrow continued to support political candidates throughout his life, but often found that his past conviction spurred the opposition to encourage those candidates to distance themselves from his endorsement. In 1969, Yarrow married Mary Beth McCarthy, a niece of the Democratic presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy. They divorced but remarried in 2022.",

                "content": "The singer was best known for such folk pop hits as \"Puff the Magic Dragon\" and \"If I Had a Hammer.\" By Gil Kaufman Peter Yarrow, one third of the beloved 1960s folk trio Peter, Paul and Mary has died at 86. According to the New York Times, spokesperson Ken Sunshine said the singer and anti-Vietnam War activist died at his home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan following a four-year battle with bladder cancer. Explore Explore Billboard See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news With his high tenor melding seamlessly with baritone Paul Stookey and contralto Mary Travers, Yarrow and this singing partners produced some of the most beloved songs of the 1960s, taking the lead on classics “Puff the Magic Dragon,” “The Great Mandala” and “Day Is Done,” all of which he wrote or co-wrote. Related Jennifer Lopez & Ben Affleck Settle Their Divorce 01/07/2025 Perhaps the group’s most well-known track, “Puff the Magic Dragon,” was penned by Yarrow based on a poem by fellow Cornell grad and author Leonard Lipton about a magical dragon name Puff and his human friend, child Jackie Paper, who take off on adventures in the magical land of Honalee. Fans of the 1963 song — which was later turned into a beloved 1978 animated special and two follow-up sequels — were convinced that it was larded with secret drug references, tagging it as a trojan horse ditty about smoking weed, a claim both Lipton and Yarrow repeatedly denied. Trending on Billboard The song was one of the group’s most successful on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No. 2 on the tally in May 1963. Following Yarrow’s death and Travers’ passing in 2009 at age 72, Stookey, 87, is the group’s last living member. “Our fearless dragon is tired and has entered the last chapter of his magnificent life. The world knows Peter Yarrow the iconic folk activist, but the human being behind the legend is every bit as generous, creative, passionate, playful, and wise as his lyrics suggest,” daughter Bethany Yarrow said in a statement according to the Associated Press. Yarrow was born in Manhattan on May 31, 1938 and after starting his singing career as a student while pursuing a degree in psychology at Cornell University in the late 1950s. He moved back to the city to begin performing in New York’s burgeoning Greenwich Village folk scene after graduation. After a performance at the Newport Folk Festival, he met the event’s founder and famed music manager Albert Grossman, who shared his idea for putting together a vocal group in the vein of the Weavers, a harmony quartet from the 1940s and 50s that sang traditional folk and labor songs as well as children’s tunes and gospel; it originally featured beloved folk singer/songwriter Pete Seeger. It was Dylan manager Grossman’s idea to put Yarrow and Travers together, with the latter later suggesting the addition of Stookey, who both had performed with on the folk scene. After signing to Warner Brothers Records, they debuted in 1962 with the song “Lemon Tree,” which peaked at No. 35 on the Hot 100. Quickly establishing their folk credentials, they followed up with the 1949 Seeger/Lee Hayes-penned protest anthem “If I Had a Hammer,” which won them two Grammy Awards in 1962 for best folk recording and best performance by a vocal group; they were also nominated for best new artist that year. They picked up two more Grammys the next year in the same categories for their cover of Bob Dylan’s “Blowin’ in the Wind” and a fifth one in 1969 (best recording for children) for the Peter, Paul and Mommy LP, which peaked at No. 12 on the album chart. Among their string of hits on the Billboard Hot 100 were their 1969 No. 1 cover of John Denver’s “Leavin’ on a Jet Plane,” as well as the No. 9 charting “I Dig Rock and Roll Music” and the No. 21 hit “Day Is Done.” They were also well-known for their charting covers of such Dylan classics as “Blowin’ in the Wind” (No. 2, 1963) and “Don’t Think Twice, It’s All Right” (No. 9, 1963), scoring a total of five top 10 albums on the Billboard 200 chart. Two of those albums, a self-titled collection from 1962 and 1963’s In the Wind, reached No. 1. (Those albums held the top two spots simultaneously, an extremely rare feat, on Nov. 2, 1963. In the Wind jumped from No. 12 to No. 1 in its second week. Peter, Paul And Mary slipped from No. 1 to No. 2 in its 80th week.) In keeping with the tenor of the era, the group were also notable for their strong, progressive political stance in song (“The Cruel War,” “Day Is Done”) and in practice. They participated Martin Luther King Jr.’s March on Washington in 1963, performing Dylan’s “Blowin’ in the Wind” (and “If I Had a Hammer”) on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, helping to cement that song’s place as a civil rights anthem. In total, the group released nine albums during their initial run before breaking up in 1970. It was around that time that Yarrow was accused of taking “immoral and indecent liberties” with a 14-year old girl, Barbara Winter, after she and her older sister came to his hotel room for an autograph and he answered the door naked and forced her to perform a sex act on herself. The singer was indicted and sentenced to one to three years in prison, and ended up serving just three months. He later apologized for the incident and was granted a presidential pardon by Jimmy Carter in January 1981, just before the late president’s final day in office. Yarrow was also an indefatigable anti-war protester, helping to organize the anti-Vietnam National Mobilization to End the War protest in 1969 in Washington that drew nearly 500,000 fellow anti-war activists, as well as 1978’s anti-nuclear benefit show Survival Sunday at the Hollywood Bowl, which featured appearances by Jackson Browne, Graham Nash and Gil Scott-Heron, among others. In 2000, he founded Operation Respect, a non-profit that aimed to tackle the mental health effects of school bullying. In addition to his work with the trio, Yarrow released five solo albums, scoring a No. 100 hit on the singles chart with “Don’t Ever Take Away My Freedom” in 1972 and a No. 163 debut on the Billboard 200 album chart in 1972 for his debut solo LP, Peter. Following solo ventures by all three, the trio reunited several times over the ensuing years, including for a 1972 concert to support George McGovern’s failed presidential campaign, his 1978 Survival Sunday anti-nukes show and a summer reunion tour that same year. By 1981 they were back together for good, performing and releasing five more albums before Travers’ death. Check out some of Yarrow’s highlights below.

Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is nixing Facebook's fact checkers and replacing them with community notes, a feature used by Elon Musk's X platform where users highlight posts they deem misleading or needing more context. Meta is abandoning the use of third party fact-checking on Facebook and Instagram and will replace it with X-style \"community notes\", where commenting on the accuracy of posts is left to users. Joel Kaplan, who is replacing Sir Nick Clegg as Meta's head of global affairs, wrote that the company's reliance on independent moderators was \"well-intentioned\" but had gone too far. \"Too much harmless content gets censored\" he wrote, adding Meta was \"too often getting in the way of the free expression we set out to enable.\" Advertisement Meta is when something refers back to or is about itself, like a book about books or a meme about memes. Meta comes from the Greek prefix and preposition meta, which means “after” or “beyond.” When combined with words in English, meta- often signifies “change” or “alteration” as in the words metamorphic or metabolic. The prefix meta- is notably used in metaphysics, a form of which is recorded in the 14th century for philosophy concerned with the first principles of things, the nuts and bolts of reality and existence. Meta-, here, suggests “transcending” or “overarching,” helping it become a synonym for self-referential by the 1980s in postmodernism and popular culture, used for creative works that alluded to their own form, genre, tropes, or other conventions. Think art about art. One early instance, for example, described an appearance of a real-life TV news anchor of Murphy Brown, a sitcom about a fictional anchor, as meta. In the 1990s–2000s, meta took special root in online gaming communities when discussing the most successful strategies, characters, or weapons. While some claim this meta is an acronym for Most Effective Tactic Available (a folk etymology), it is short for metagaming, using knowledge about the game itself to beat the “game” of mastering that game. In the late 1990s, metagaming was used in games like Dungeons & Dragons to refer to an in-game character unfairly using information gathered outside of the game world by their player. Meta has gone on, in the gaming world, for anything out of the universe of the game used to affect the universe in the game—cheating, in a nutshell, and making the game less fun for more earnest players. True to its history, meta can be prefixed (e.g., meta-definition). It can act as a simple modifier (e.g., He made a meta comment on Facebook). It’s often used in the predicate, though, as in: that video was so meta. Examples of meta are often found in fine arts, with, say, paintings of paintings or photographs of photographers. Popular culture has also gone meta, with cartoons showing their self-awareness as cartoons or films mocking the tropes of film. The ironic, self-parodying culture of the internet makes it a hotbed for meta. I haven't been tweeting much today. I suppose this is a meta-tweet, about tweeting. — Jacqui Cheng, PhD Blogger School of Hard Knocks (@ejacqui) July 23, 2007 is walking by the Twitter offices in South Park. Oddly meta? — ˗ˏˋ Chris Messina ´ˎ˗ (@chrismessina) February 5, 2007 Nowhere is this truer than memes, which, when they become quickly popular, instantly get remixed into other memes or into memes about their own viral meme-dom. More examples of meta: “One meta joke that didn’t make it into the film, however, would have poked fun at the fact that Benedict Cumberbatch and Robert Downey Jr. have both played a certain turn-of-the-century London-based detective.” —Josh Weiss, Syfy, August 2018 In October 2021, Facebook announced the new company name Meta. The name Facebook will still be used—the change involves Facebook becoming a subsidiary of Meta, along with other products like Instagram and WhatsApp. The name change followed announcements about the company’s plans to develop an online platform called the Metaverse, incorporating elements of virtual reality and augmented reality. (The word metaverse has traditionally been used to refer to some form of virtual world.) The name change came amid increased scrutiny of Facebook and its business practices relating to internal documents leaked by a whistleblower and other recent scandals. It was not the first name change by a tech giant. In 2015, Google was similarly restructured to become part of a parent company named Alphabet. Both changes are thought to be part of rebranding efforts that serve to encompass the wide-ranging scope of the companies’ beyond their traditional core (advertising-based) products.

TGL provides your beneficiaries basic financial protection if you were to die before you retire or reach the age of expiry. Contact your employer to find out whether you have TGL cover or not. A full amount of compensation corresponds to six price base amounts. Payment is age-dependent and reduces the older you get. If you have children who have not reached the age of 20 at the time of your death, each child will receive additional compensation. You can see the current applicable amount of compensation in the pre-purchase information. The insurance applies as long as you are employed and will cease when you retire. If you continue working after the age of 65, the insurance will automatically cease when you reach 'the age of expiry', which usually is the age of 70. All life insurance policies have a fixed order of priority regarding the beneficiaries in the terms and conditions. If you would like to change this order, you have to do this with a special form called ‘nomination of beneficiary’ (särskilt förmånstagarförordnande). The following priority of beneficiaries applies to TGL within the collective agreement area for the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise and The Council for Negotiation and Cooperation (Svenskt Näringsliv and PTK): Half a price base amount is paid out to your estate if none of the above is alive and no separate nomination of beneficiary has been registered.

Before then, more than 300 years ago, Richmond's drinking water came from numerous springs and an open stream flowing from the Capitol across Main Street. Over the years the plant has been upgraded and enlarged to meet growing demand. Today, Richmond's Department of Public Utilities' (DPU) water plant can produce up to 132 million gallons per day (MGD). DPU also provides water to Henrico, Chesterfield, Hanover, Goochland and Powhatan counties through wholesale contracts. Details are outlined in the current water plan. DPU has invested millions of dollars to ensure it always meets or exceeds federal regulations as well as the increasing regional demands for reliable, high-quality drinking water. Water utility employees perform numerous water tests every day and maintain more than 1,200 miles of water lines so that when you turn on the tap, your family will receive water that is clean and safe. Explore the video to discover how clean and safe water is delivered to you. The City of Richmond Department of Public Utilities is a member of the American Water Works Association, the American Water Works Association Research Foundation, and the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies. These organizations are dedicated to furthering knowledge and research on safe drinking water. Drinking water, including bottled water, may reasonably be expected to contain at least small amounts of some substances. The presence of substances does not necessarily indicate that the water poses a health risk. More information about substances and potential health effects may be obtained by calling the Environmental Protection Agency ’s (EPA) Safe Drinking Water Hotline at 1-800-426-4791. Some people may be more vulnerable to certain substances in drinking water than the general population. Immuno-compromised people - such as those with cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy, those who have undergone organ transplants, those with HIV/AIDS or other immune system disorders, and some elderly people and infants - can be particularly at risk from infections. These people should seek advice from their health care providers about drinking water. EPA/CDC (Centers for Disease Control) guidelines on appropriate means to lessen the risk of infection by Cryptosporidium and other microbial substances are available from the Safe Drinking Water Hotline at 1-800-426-4791. The 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act requires water utilities to provide consumers with a yearly report on the source and quality of the water they drink. You may also find our Water Quality Reports on this page. The state allows us to monitor for some substances less than once per year because the concentrations of these substances do not change frequently. The Virginia Department of Health conducted a source water assessment of our system during 2002. The Richmond Water Treatment Plant was determined to be of high susceptibility to contamination, using criteria developed by the state in its EPA-approved Source Water Assessment Program. The assessment report consists of maps showing the source water assessment area, an inventory of known land use activities of concern, and documentation of any known contamination within the last five years from the date of assessment. This report is available by contacting the Department of Public Utilities at 646-5777. The water quality report is a snapshot of the city’s drinking water quality over the past year. Included is information about your water, what it contains and how it compares with standards mandated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Virginia Department of Health. This report is being provided to comply with the 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act. Landlords, businesses and other property owners are encouraged to share this drinking water quality report with tenants.

More information about substances and potential health effects may be obtained by calling the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Safe Drinking Water Hotline at 1-800-426-4791. As water travels over land or through the ground, it dissolves naturally occurring minerals and, in some cases, radioactive material. Water can pick up substances resulting from the presence of animals or human activity. Substances that may be present in source water include: Water treatment significantly reduces the level of these substances in drinking water. In order to ensure that tap water is safe to drink, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations limit the amount of certain substances in water provided by public water systems. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations establish limits for substances in bottled water, which must provide the same protection for public health. If present, elevated levels of lead can cause serious health problems, especially for pregnant women and young children. Lead in drinking water is primarily from materials and components associated with service lines and home plumbing. The City of Richmond is responsible for providing high quality drinking water, but cannot control the variety of materials used in plumbing components. When your water has been sitting for several hours, you can minimize the potential for lead exposure by flushing your tap for 15-30 seconds or until it becomes cold or reaches a steady temperature before using water for cooking or drinking. If you are concerned about lead in your water, you may wish to have your water tested. Information on lead in drinking water, testing materials, and steps you can take to minimize exposure is available from the Drinking Water Hotline. Crytosporidium is a microbial parasite found in surface water throughout the United States. We collected seven samples in 2017 and found an average of 5.4 Oocysts/100L. This is less than the Action Level of 7.5 Oocysts/100L. Contact the City of Richmond Department of Public Utilities at (804) 646-4646 for additional copies of the Water Quality Report.

                "title": "Richmond still without water as lawmakers converge for General Assembly - The Washington Post",
                "content": "By 6 p.m. Tuesday, water still had not been restored in the city and even some surrounding counties were reporting problems. RICHMOND — Water outages that hit much of the city after a winter storm knocked out Richmond’s water supply continued into the evening Tuesday, with residents lining up for bottled water and waiting fruitlessly at empty taps. Capitol Square, normally swarmed with legislators and lobbyists on the eve of a new General Assembly session, was all but deserted throughout the day, with the Capitol and surrounding buildings shuttered as the city struggled to get its water supply back in service following Monday’s snowstorm. Shortly after noon Tuesday, the city said water production had restarted but would take several hours to build up enough supply to resume flowing to residents’ taps. Mayor Danny Avula — who took office just a week ago — said at an early-morning news conference that a boil-water advisory issued Monday by the city and state health departments would be in place for at least 16 hours after water service returns. “I know this is a really challenging time to figure out how to operate without water,” Avula said. “But I ask for your continued patience. Things are looking good for today, and we will continue to work tirelessly to make sure that we have restored full service to the people of the city.” But by 6 p.m. Tuesday, water still had not been restored in the city, and even some surrounding counties were reporting problems. Despite icy streets, grocery stores endured a run on bottled water. Downtown on Tuesday, Devin Briggs, 31, struggled to lug eight gallons of water up to his apartment in two plastic bags. “Annoying” is how he summed up the situation, which had forced the bank employee to drive to a Hanover County Walmart to find water. The 7-Eleven on the first floor of his building had sold out the day before. “No cases, no bottles,” clerk Tara Culliton said from behind the counter, emptied of pizza slices and taquitos because staff lacked water to wash their hands to prepare the items. “We can’t even brew coffee.” The problem started Monday morning when a power outage caused by snow and ice hit the city’s main water facility. Dominion Energy said power was restored after about two hours, by a little after 9:30 a.m. Monday, but Avula said the outage caused a cascading effect. A pump failed and water surged into an area of electrical equipment, shorting out the computerized controls. Initially, Avula said, officials thought the primary reservoir had enough water to last until about 6 p.m., which would have given workers time to make repairs before residents were affected. Richmond worked with the surrounding counties of Henrico, Hanover and Chesterfield to remove customers there from the city system and onto their own backup supplies, he said. But high demand caused the system to drain faster than expected. By about 3 p.m., residents around the city of about 230,000 people experienced very low water pressure. Finally, a little after 4 p.m., the city issued an urgent advisory warning all residents to boil water before consuming it. At that time, though, much of the city had no water from its taps. Problems spread Tuesday afternoon, as eastern Henrico locations including Richmond International Airport reported low or no water flow, which county officials attributed to a broken water main compounded by issues related to the Richmond outage. The county declared a state of emergency and made water available at several locations where residents could fill containers. Officials in Hanover County issued a boil-water advisory Tuesday afternoon for the area east of Interstate 95, except Doswell, due to the outage. A spokesman for Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) said the governor spoke with Avula on Tuesday afternoon and that state agencies were coordinating with the city to alleviate the situation. “Our teams also worked overnight to supply area hospitals with tanker trucks of water and delivered nearly 70 pallets of water to the city with an additional 350 pallets en route for distribution,” Youngkin spokesman Christian Martinez said. He added that Youngkin will continue to monitor the situation. Richmond’s schools are closed Wednesday due to the outage. The aftermath of the storm also continued to affect some D.C.-area schools — including those in Montgomery and Loudoun counties — which will be closed again Wednesday because of poor road conditions in parts of the region. So far, districts have not yet shifted to virtual learning because they built traditional snow days into school calendars. “The safety of our students and staff is our priority during inclement weather and its aftermath,” the Montgomery County Public Schools said in its announcement. “Our crews are working as quickly as possible to ready our schools for a return to learning.” Richmond’s water outage came just as state lawmakers from around Virginia were converging on Richmond for Opening Day of the General Assembly session, scheduled to begin at noon Wednesday. House Speaker Don Scott (D-Portsmouth) said he was “optimistic” that everything would be on schedule Wednesday. “Use the bathroom before you get there, we’re starting at noon,” Scott joked in a brief interview. In the meantime, lawmakers posted photos on social media of heating pans of snow on the stove to get water. Avula said the city was working to get water supplies to vulnerable populations, such as in shelters, hospitals and senior living centers. The Virginia Commonwealth University health system said that clinics would be closed. Elective surgeries as well as outpatient diagnostic testing and imaging at the VCU Medical Center, Children’s Hospital of Richmond and Stoney Point have been canceled and will be rescheduled, the hospital system posted on X. However, the VCU hospital and Children’s Hospital of Richmond emergency departments were open and seeing patients. Reporters questioned why the city waited so long to send out notice — after the point when many residents could do much to prepare. Avula said officials acted as quickly as they could in an unpredictable situation. “We really were trying to get things up and running yesterday so that we could avoid the boil-water advisory altogether,” Avula said. “I’m sorry that … we weren’t able to provide a little more buffer.” He said he had been with water treatment officials all through the night Monday into Tuesday. Equipment containing the computer brains of the system had been flooded and had to be opened up and dried out. The IT network finally came back online around midnight Tuesday, he said, but even then equipment would start and then stop. Once water is restored, officials will need at least 16 hours to test the supply to make sure it’s clean, meaning residents will have to continue boiling water for consumption.

                "content": "Robert Peter Williams (born 13 February 1974)[1] is an English singer and songwriter. He found fame as a member of the pop group Take That from 1990 to 1995, launching a solo career in 1996. His debut studio album, Life thru a Lens, was released in 1997, and included his best-selling single \"Angels\". His second album, I've Been Expecting You, featured the songs \"Millennium\" and \"She's the One\", his first and second number one singles. His discography includes seven UK No. 1 singles, and all but one of his 14 studio albums have reached No. 1 in the UK. Six of his albums are among the top 100 biggest-selling albums in the UK, with two of them in the top 60, and he gained a Guinness World Record in 2006 for selling 1.6 million tickets in a single day during his Close Encounters Tour.[2] Williams has received a record 18 Brit Awards, winning Best British Male Artist four times, Outstanding Contribution to Music twice, an Icon Award for his lasting impact on British culture, eight German ECHO Awards, and three MTV European Music Awards.[3][4] In 2004, he was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame after being voted the Greatest Artist of the 1990s. According to the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), he has been certified for 20.36 million albums and 9.2 million singles in the UK as a solo artist.[5] Five of his albums have also topped the Australian albums chart, and has sold 75 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. He also topped the 2000–2010 UK airplay chart. His three concerts at Knebworth in 2003 drew over 375,000 people, the UK's biggest music event to that point.[6] In 2014, he was awarded the freedom of his hometown of Stoke-on-Trent and had a tourist trail created and streets named in his honour. Williams' latest compilation album, XXV, was released on 9 September 2022.[7][8] After 15 years, Williams rejoined Take That in 2010 to co-write and perform lead vocals on their album Progress, which became the second-fastest-selling album in UK chart history[9] and the fastest-selling record of the century at the time.[10] The subsequent stadium tour, which featured seven songs from Williams' solo career, became the biggest-selling concert in UK history when it sold 1.34 million tickets in less than 24 hours. In 2011, Take That frontman Gary Barlow confirmed that Williams had left the band for a second time to focus on his solo career, although he stated that the departure was amicable and that Williams was welcome to rejoin Take That in the future.[11] Williams has since performed with Take That on three separate television appearances,[12][13][14] and collaborated with Barlow on a number of projects[15] such as the West End musical The Band.[16] Robert Peter Williams was born on 13 February 1974 in Stoke-on-Trent, the son of Janet (née Farrell) and Peter Williams (also known as Pete Conway), who ran a pub called the Red Lion in Burslem before becoming the licensee at the Port Vale Social Club.[17] His maternal grandfather was an Irishman from Kilkenny.[18] He attended St Margaret Ward Catholic School in Tunstall[19] and participated in several school plays, most notably in the role of the Artful Dodger in a production of Oliver![20] In 1990, the sixteen-year-old Williams was the youngest member to join Take That. According to the documentary Take That: For the Record, his mother read an advertisement seeking members for a new boy band and suggested that he try out for the group. He met fellow member Mark Owen on the day of his audition/interview with Nigel Martin-Smith. Although the majority of the group's material was written and performed by Gary Barlow, Williams performed lead vocals on their first Top Three hits \"Could It Be Magic\", \"I Found Heaven\", and \"Everything Changes\". Williams' use of alcohol and cocaine brought him into conflict with Martin-Smith over the behaviour rules for Take That members.[21] In November 1994, Williams's drug use had escalated; he nearly had a drug overdose the night before the group was scheduled to perform at the MTV Europe Music Awards.[22] According to the documentary For the Record, he was unhappy with his musical ideas not being taken seriously by Martin-Smith and lead singer Barlow; his desire to explore hip hop and rap conflicted with Take That's usual ballads. Barlow stated in interviews that Williams had given up trying to offer creative input. Noting Williams's increasingly belligerent behaviour and poor attendance at rehearsals, and worried that he might leave the group during their upcoming tour, Barlow and Jason Orange took their concerns to Martin-Smith. During one of the last rehearsals before the tour commenced, the three confronted Williams about his attitude and stated they wanted to do the tour without him. He agreed to quit and left the group in July 1995; it would be the last time for twelve years that they were all together. Despite the departure of Williams, Take That completed their Nobody Else Tour as a four-piece. They later disbanded on 13 February 1996, Williams's 22nd birthday.[23] Shortly afterwards, Williams was photographed by the press partying with the members of Oasis at Glastonbury Festival. Following his departure, he became the subject of talk shows and newspapers as he acknowledged his plans to become a solo singer, and he was spotted partying with George Michael in France. A clause in his Take That contract prohibited him from releasing any material until after the group was officially dissolved, and he was later sued by Martin-Smith and forced to pay $200,000 in commission. After various legal battles over his right to a solo career, Williams succeeded in getting released from his contract with BMG. On 27 June 1996, he signed with Chrysalis Records. By March 2009, Williams had shown interest in rejoining Take That;[24] the band completed their The Circus Live without him. In spite of rumours that Williams was working in New York with Take That in September that year,[25] by the day of the Children in Need charity concert at the Royal Albert Hall in November they were still performing separately. Both did join with the other acts in the final song of the evening, with Williams putting his arm around Gary Barlow and singing \"Hey Jude\". On 15 July 2010, Williams reconciled with his former colleagues and rejoined Take That. In November 2010 the Take That album Progress was released, becoming the fastest selling album since 2000 and the second fastest selling album in UK history.[26] The group travelled across the UK on their Progress Live tour, which included eight nights at Wembley Stadium in London,[27] then continued across Europe. The tour was the fastest selling in UK history with ticket hotlines and websites crashing under the demand.[27] In August 2012, Take That performed at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics. Williams was due to perform with Take That but missed the performance because his wife gave birth at around the same time; the group performed as a four-piece.[28] Although still officially part of Take That,[29] Williams chose not to return for group's seventh and eighth studio albums and their accompanying tours, focusing instead on his solo commitments. He continued to write music with his colleagues and has performed with the group on several occasions since 2011's Progress tour[30] and planned to return for a full tour to celebrate Take That's 30th anniversary in 2019.[31] Williams launched his solo career in 1996 with a cover of George Michael's \"Freedom\", which reached number two in the UK Singles Chart.[32] Recordings for Williams's first album began at London's Maison Rouge studios in March 1997. Shortly after his introduction to songwriter and producer Guy Chambers, Williams released \"Old Before I Die\", the first single from his debut album. The single reached number two on the UK Charts;[32] it was largely ignored on international charts. His debut album, Life thru a Lens, was released in September 1997. The album launched with his first live solo gig at the Élysée Montmartre theatre in Paris, France. The album debuted at number eleven on the UK Albums Chart. \"Angels\", the fourth single, is Williams' best-seller in the United Kingdom.[33] The song, apart from becoming a hit around Europe and Latin America, caused sales of his album to skyrocket. The album remained in the British top ten for forty weeks and spent 218 weeks there altogether, making it the 58th best selling album in UK history with sales of over 2.4 million.[34] The album eventually managed to sell over three million copies in Europe.[35] Williams and Chambers started writing the second album, I've Been Expecting You, in Jamaica in early 1998. The first single, \"Millennium\", accompanied with a music video featuring Williams parodying James Bond, complete with tuxedo and references to Bond films like Thunderball and From Russia with Love, became Williams' first solo number one single in the United Kingdom.[36] It also became a top twenty hit in many European countries, Latin America and Australia.[37] I've Been Expecting You was released in late October 1998 and debuted at number one in the UK Albums Chart.[36] The album received more attention outside the United Kingdom, leaving its mark in the European and Latin American markets with hits such as \"No Regrets\", a collaboration with the Pet Shop Boys' singer Neil Tennant and the Divine Comedy's Neil Hannon. \"She's the One\", a cover of a World Party track written by Karl Wallinger, became Williams' second UK number-one single.[36] Williams finished the year with a European Tour late in 1999. I've Been Expecting You sold almost 3 million copies in the UK and was certified 10× Platinum by the BPI.[38] In Europe, the album sold over 4 million copies.[39] In 1999, Williams was signed to Capitol Records in the United States, a part of EMI. He embarked on a United States promotional tour and released his first United States and Canadian single, \"Millennium\". The compilation album The Ego Has Landed was released in July 1999 in the United States and Canada. In the middle of promotion and the tours in 1999, Williams began work on his third studio album. The first single taken from the album was \"Rock DJ\", a song inspired by Williams's UNICEF mentor, the late Ian Dury. The video created by Fred & Farid[40] showed Williams in an attempt to get noticed by a group of women, first stripping and then tearing chunks of skin and muscle from his body, and caused controversy in the United Kingdom and many other countries. The video was edited by Top of the Pops for its graphic content and many other channels followed suit.[41] The song became an instant hit, reaching number one in the UK (becoming his third number one single as a solo artist) and New Zealand. The song went on to win \"Best Song of 2000\" at the MTV Europe Music Awards, \"Best Single of the Year\" at the Brit Awards and an MTV Video Music Award for Best Special Effects.[42] When the album, Sing When You're Winning was released in August 2000, it topped the charts in many different countries.[43] In the UK the album was certified 2× Platinum on its first week of release.[44] After the success of his third album, Williams wanted to take another musical direction. He took two weeks off from his tour to record Swing When You're Winning, his fourth studio album. Born from his lifelong love for Frank Sinatra – combined with the success of the track \"Have You Met Miss Jones?\" that he recorded for the film Bridget Jones' Diary in 2001 – the album was recorded at Capitol Studios in Los Angeles. Williams took the chance to duet with his long-time friend Jonathan Wilkes, Little Voice star Jane Horrocks, Saturday Night Live star Jon Lovitz, Rupert Everett and actress Nicole Kidman. The first single released from the album was a duet with Kidman, on \"Somethin' Stupid\". Originally a hit for Frank and Nancy Sinatra, the song became Williams' fifth number one hit in the UK.[45] It eventually went on to become one of the biggest hits of 2001.[46] \"Beyond the Sea\" was featured over the credits of the film Finding Nemo in 2003 and was also released on the film's soundtrack CD. A DVD, Robbie Williams Live at the Albert Hall, was released in December of that year. So far, it has become one of the best selling music DVDs in Europe, being certified 6× Platinum in the United Kingdom[47] and 2× Platinum in Germany.[48] In 2002, Williams signed a record-breaking £80 million contract with EMI.[49] The contract included a number of provisos, including the label ceding greater creative control to the artist and a commitment to breaking Williams into the US market. It remains the biggest music deal in British history. The deal was brokered by Ingenious Media, a UK corporate finance advisory business. Williams began working on what would be his fifth studio album, spending a year in the recording studio. The album heralded a new era for Williams. He had taken a more active role in the making of this album. \"One Fine Day\", \"Nan's Song\", and \"Come Undone\" were the first songs that Williams wrote without the input of Guy Chambers. Most of the songs were recorded in Los Angeles. \"For the first time in my life, I'm speechless.\" The album's first single, \"Feel\", written by Williams and Chambers, was recorded as a demo. When they started working on the album and were trying to re-record the vocals, Williams felt dissatisfied with it, so he decided to include the demo version and then release it as the first single. When the single was released in late 2002, it became Williams' biggest international hit, going number one in The Netherlands and Italy and reaching the top ten in many European countries.[50] When Williams' fifth studio album, Escapology, was released in late 2002, it hit number one in at least 10 countries around the world. In the United States, it failed to make such an impact. Escapology sold almost 2 million copies by the end of 2003 in the United Kingdom.[51] On 1–3 August 2003, Williams played three consecutive concerts at Knebworth to 125,000 people each night, making it the biggest event in UK music history.[6] Memorable performances included \"Come Undone\" where he interjected with \"Britain, I'm Your Son\", and further interacted with the audience when he brought a girl up on stage.[52] In October 2003, Williams released a live album of the concerts, Live at Knebworth.[53] In October 2004, Williams released Greatest Hits, a retrospective of his career, which also contained new tracks he had been working on with then-new collaborator Stephen Duffy. \"Radio\", the compilation's first single, debuted at number one in the UK Singles Chart,[36] becoming Williams' sixth number-one hit. When the compilation was released, it debuted at number one in the UK[36] and was the best selling album of the year in the UK[54] and Europe.[55] Eight years after the release of \"Angels\", the British public voted it as the \"Best Single of the Past Twenty-Five Years\" at the 2005 Brit Awards.[56] After touring Latin America in late 2004 for the promotion Greatest Hits, Williams started working on his sixth studio album. Recorded at his house in the Hollywood Hills, the album was co-written by Stephen Duffy over the course of 24 months. The album Intensive Care was launched in Berlin on 9 October. It became an international hit. In November 2005, Williams took home the MTV Europe Music Award for 'Best Male', but also, entered in The Guinness Book of World Records when he announced his World Tour for 2006, selling 1.6 million tickets in one single day.[57] Williams kicked off his Close Encounters World Tour in South Africa in April 2006; when he finished his European leg of the tour, 2.5 million people had seen the show and, after touring Latin America and Australia, the numbers went up to 3 million.[58] Williams released his much anticipated dance/electro album, Rudebox, on 23 October 2006. It featured collaborations with the Pet Shop Boys, William Orbit, Soul Mekanik, Joey Negro, Mark Ronson, Chris Grierson, and The Orr Boys. It received mixed reviews: Allmusic gave it a four star rating, the NME 8 out of 10, and Music Week and MOJO were equally positive,[59] but it received much weaker reviews from some of the British press. The album sold 2× Platinum in Europe with sales of over 2 million making it the fastest platinum-selling album of 2006.[60] To promote his album, Williams commissioned a series of short films.[61] Goodbye to the Normals was directed by Jim Field Smith and features \"Burslem Normals\" by Williams. In February 2009, it was confirmed that Williams had written material with Guy Chambers and Mark Ronson. A spokesman said that Williams was planning to begin the recording sessions in March and that the new album would be released in late 2009. This will probably be the last Williams album released by EMI.[62] On his official website, Williams confirmed that he was working with producer Trevor Horn on his new album, which would eventually be titled Reality Killed the Video Star,[63] a reference to the song \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" by Horn's former band the Buggles. The album was released on 9 November 2009 in the United Kingdom.[64] On 11 October 2009 Williams published a 12-track compilation album, titled Songbook, as a free CD for the newspaper The Mail on Sunday. That same evening, Williams made his \"comeback\" on The X Factor results show, performing his new single \"Bodies\" for the first time live.[65] On 20 October 2009 Williams opened the BBC Electric Proms at the London RoundHouse.[66] It was his first live concert for 3 years and was broadcast across 200 cinemas worldwide.[67] Accompanied by a string section, horn section, full band and producer Trevor Horn, Williams performed several new tracks from Reality Killed the Video Star and older tracks.[67] Reality Killed the Video Star was previewed in the UK on the Spotify music streaming service on 6 November 2009, and official released on 9 November.[68] In a high-profile chart battle, Williams' album was pitted against X Factor 2008 runners-up JLS who released their debut album the same day. JLS beat Williams to the number one spot by 1500 sales. The album was also released in the United States (Williams' first album to be released there since 2002's Escapology). In late November 2009, Williams travelled to Australia to perform at the ARIA Music Awards of 2009.[69] In October 2010, Williams released his second greatest hits album, In and Out of Consciousness: The Greatest Hits 1990–2010, to celebrate 20 years as a performing artist. A single, \"Shame\", was also released, which was written and sung by Williams and Barlow. On 21 October 2011 Williams signed with Island Records (Universal Music), following his departure from his previous record label EMI in 2010.[70] Williams was the opening act at the Diamond Jubilee Concert, which was co-organised by Gary Barlow, held outside Buckingham Palace on 4 June 2012.[71] During the end of August his official website began a countdown to the release of information regarding his latest solo material, with an image of his face and his mind unveiled daily as the countdown expired.[72] Titled Take the Crown, the album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart making it Williams' tenth number one album. It also marked the second time that Williams had a number one single (\"Candy\") and album at the same time on the chart. The first time was in 2001 when \"Somethin' Stupid\" and Swing When You're Winning were number one on the singles and albums chart respectively.[73] The album's lead single, \"Candy\", premiered on 10 September 2012 and was released on 11 September in most countries and 29 October in the UK. In the UK, \"Candy\" became Williams' first number one single since \"Radio\" (2004) and his seventh solo number one single. In its first week the song had sold 137,000 copies becoming the fastest-selling male artist single of the year.[74] On 26 November 2012 Williams announced a 17 date stadium tour of Europe.[75][76] Williams also confirmed that the support act for the tour would be Olly Murs who also duets with him on \"Kids\". Universal and EMI merged in 2012, bringing Williams' Chrysalis/Virgin recordings full circle to Universal. In September 2013, Williams announced a follow-up to his 2001 swing album, titled Swings Both Ways for release in November. The album features covers and original songs, whilst also including duet recordings with Michael Bublé, Olly Murs, Rufus Wainwright, Lily Allen and Kelly Clarkson.[77] In November 2013, Williams made a cameo appearance in the video to Murs's song \"Hand on Heart\".[78] Williams released a compilation album entitled Under the Radar Volume 1 on 1 December 2014 through his website, featuring leftovers and unreleased songs.[79] \"[These are] loads and loads of songs that I have written that I am incredibly passionate about, I want you to hear them, otherwise they are just going to remain in my computer!\"[80] Williams said that Guy Chambers was \"not happy\" about these songs being released online: \"He thinks I am a lunatic for not putting them on an album that we have promoted with TV performances and at radio stations and a big tour,\" Williams said. \"But I am an impetuous bugger, and I want them out now, now, now!\"[81] In May 2016, it was announced that Williams had signed a recording contract with Sony Music. In a statement, Williams said: \"They're [Sony Music] inspired, I'm inspired. I'm more ready than I ever have been and I'm totally convinced I'm in the right place. I look forward to working on this album, which is an album I'm immensely proud of, in this exciting new partnership with Sony Music.\"[82] The Heavy Entertainment Show became his 12th UK number-one album, putting him level with Madonna.[83] In July 2017, Williams announced a new album, Under the Radar Volume 2, which was released in November 2017.[84] A third edition in the Under the Radar series was released on Valentine's Day of 2019.[85] On 14 June 2018, Williams performed at the 2018 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony held at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, Russia.[86] Williams sang \"Let Me Entertain You\" and \"Feel\" before he performed a duet of \"Angels\" with Russian soprano Aida Garifullina.[86][87] Williams then performed an encore with \"Rock DJ\", during which he gave the finger.[88] Fox in the U.S. apologised for the incident which they had broadcast live.[88] The incident was not shown on ITV in the UK who had cut away prior to the encore.[88] Williams appeared on This Morning on 19 June and explained what happened, \"It was one minute to kick off, I was under a lot of pressure, because there was one minute left and I didn't know how I was going to do half a minute, so I just did a one-minute countdown [using his middle finger].\" Asked by presenter Phillip Schofield whether he regrets it, he said: \"Yeah, of course, yeah. I cannot trust me. I don't know what I'm going to do at any time. There's no, sort of, plan. The plan was, sing in key, don't fall over. That was the plan and 99% of the plan, I pulled off.\" When asked did the idea just enter his head he responded, \"Nothing actually pops into my head. There's a block between me and sense... then something happens and then five minutes later, I'm like, 'Did I? Yeah, I did, didn't I?\".[89] On 17 July 2018, Williams along with his wife, and One Direction star Louis Tomlinson, were announced as the new judges on the fifteenth series of The X Factor in the UK, joining Simon Cowell and replacing Louis Walsh, Sharon Osbourne and Nicole Scherzinger.[90] On 22 November, Williams released his first Christmas album titled The Christmas Present, which features guest appearances from boxer Tyson Fury, Rod Stewart, Jamie Cullum, Helene Fischer and Bryan Adams. The album debuted at number two on the UK Charts behind Coldplay's Everyday Life. The album sold over 67,000 copies, which is identical sales to his previous studio album release The Heavy Entertainment Show, Williams also sold over 10,000 cassettes in 7 days, which is the most in two decades. The following week saw Williams' album go to #1 in the UK, outselling the nearest competitor Rod Stewart by 5,000 copies. This was Williams' 13th UK number-one album, tying Elvis Presley for the most UK number-one albums.[91] Williams released the promotional single \"Hey Tiger\" in December 2019, for the new version of The Tiger Who Came to Tea.[92] On 25 February 2022, it was revealed that Williams had teamed up with his regular collaborators Tim Metcalfe and Flynn Francis to record the trance track \"Sway\" under the new alias 'Lufthaus'.[93] In April 2022, The Guardian observed that while Williams \"remains a big draw\", he was no longer guaranteed hits and was \"now more likely to be playlisted on Smooth Radio than BBC Radio 1\". Williams said he was working on more experimental music, which he likened to David Bowie and Lou Reed, but said: \"Do I unashamedly want to still be one of the biggest artists in the world? Yeah, I do ... I've had an interesting first half of my life. I'd like an interesting second half, too.\"[94] In May 2022, Williams performed at the Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne, Australia, during the filming of his Better Man biopic which was produced at Docklands Studios Melbourne, and was expected to be released in late 2023 however its schedule was delayed instead to 2024.[95] On 7 June 2022, Williams announced that his tenth compilation album, XXV, would be released on 9 September 2022.[96] It will feature new, reimagined versions of his hit songs, plus new material.

His appearance attracted criticism due to Qatar's human rights abuses and strict LGBT laws.[111][112][113] After the criticism, Williams stated, \"I don't condone any abuses of human rights anywhere [...] if we're not condoning human rights abuses anywhere, then it would be the shortest tour the world has ever known: I wouldn't even be able to perform in my own kitchen [...] Anybody leaving messages saying 'no to Qatar' are doing so on Chinese technology [...] the hypocrisy there is that if we take that case in this place, we need to apply that unilaterally to the world. Then if we apply that unilaterally to the world, nobody can go anywhere.\"[114] On 5 May 2023, Williams was featured on the bilingual single \"Une Tahitienne á Paris\", by French singer Mareva Galanter.[115][116] On 21 August 2023, Williams was featured with a cameo performance on the single \"Punk's Dead\", by English duo Soft Play.[117] Lufthaus' debut album, \"Visions, Volume 1\" was released on 6 October 2023.

Williams launched a radio show titled Radio Rudebox on 6 October 2011 where he played music and interviewed Gary Barlow. In 2011, Williams announced he was working with entrepreneur Peter Jones in developing a clothing line called Farrell in honour of his grandfather Jack Farrell.[137] Although the business had filed for bankruptcy, it was later relaunched in 2014 with support of clothing company Primark.[138] Williams recorded the song \"It's Only Us\" as the theme for the FIFA video game FIFA 2000.[139] As part of the agreement to license the track EA Sports included Port Vale, the football club Williams supports, in the game, despite only being in the third tier of the English football league system.[139] Williams features in his own karaoke video game, We Sing Robbie Williams, which was released on 12 November 2010 by Nordic Games Publishing AB.[140] In 2005, Williams founded a football team called Los Angeles Vale F.C. Williams formed the club with other celebrity friends after building his own soccer pitch at his home in Los Angeles.[141][142] The club was named after Williams' hometown club, Port Vale, and its logo was very similar.[143] The club supposedly was disbanded in 2007, reportedly after Williams discovered two players had swindled him out of £200,000.[144][145] In January 2024, Williams was named president of Port Vale Football Club in Stoke-on-Trent.[146] In 2018, it was announced that Williams and Guy Chambers would write the music and lyrics (with a book by Mark Ravenhill) for the stage musical adaptation of David Walliams' children's book The Boy in the Dress for the Royal Shakespeare Company. The musical opened in November 2019 at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon where it ran for an 18-week season, earning rave reviews from the critics and audiences.[147] In August 2024, Better Man, a biopic about Williams' life, opened to critical acclaim at the Telluride Film Festival and later screened at the Toronto International Film Festival on 10 September 2024, with its theatrically released premiere on 26 December 2024 in Australia by Roadshow Films and in the United Kingdom by Entertainment Film Distributors.[148][149] It had a limited theatrical release by Paramount Pictures in the United States on 25 December, before a wider release set for 10 January 2025.[150][151] Better Man received a record-breaking 16 nominations at the 2025 AACTA Awards.[126] During his childhood, Williams was influenced by swing musicians such as Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis Jr. The first records he listened to were released by Nat King Cole, Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald and Cole Porter, which belonged to his mother. At the age of 10, he got into hip hop and started collecting electro albums;[152] and when he started his solo career in the '90s, he was influenced by Britpop bands such as Oasis, Blur and Pulp.[153] As a singer, his influences include George Michael, Tom Jones,[152] Elvis Presley and Bono.[154] He worked with Jones several times throughout his career: They performed together at the Brit Awards in 1998; the following year, they recorded a cover of the song \"Are You Gonna Go My Way\" for Jones' album Reload; and in 2012, Williams and Jones worked together again on the song \"On My Own\", b-side of his single \"Different\". Williams also feels great admiration for Freddie Mercury[155] and Queen. In 2001, Williams, Brian May and Roger Taylor released a new version of \"We Are the Champions\" for the movie A Knight's Tale. He also revealed that he was once asked to be the new frontman of Queen, but that he turned down the offer because of his \"very low self-esteem\". He said: \"I just thought I'd save them the audacity of me even trying to step on a stage and be in the same echelon as Freddie Mercury. Because he, to me, is angelic. He's godlike. It was just too scary.\"[156] Williams has revealed that he does the \"Elvis Prayer\" before going on stage at every concert. In 2000, he got a tattoo of the phrase \"Elvis Grant Me Serenity\"[157] and he also played as an Elvis impersonator in the music video for his song \"Advertising Space\" (2005). Speaking to BBC Radio 2 in February 2021, Williams cited Ian Dury as his biggest inspiration as a lyricist.[158] He sings on \"You're the Why\", the final track of the posthumously released album Ten More Turnips from the Tip (2002).[159] By 2008, Williams had sold more albums in the UK than any other British solo artist in history.[160] His record sales stand at over 77 million worldwide, making him one of the best-selling artists of all time.[161] Williams was entered in The Guinness Book of World Records when, after he announced his World Tour for 2006, 1.6 million tickets were sold in one day.[162] \"It's his self-deprecating sense of humour — in person and in his lyrics — that helps explain his wide appeal in Australia. Perhaps only Pink and Ed Sheeran have such a wide mix of demographics at their concerts; that's why Williams will play to nearly 60,000 people in Victoria alone.\" Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian wrote that Williams is \"a perfect meeting of ego, self-deprecation and hits\", adding \"there really is nobody else, in pop music anyway, who combines monumental hamminess and bone-deep vulnerability quite so effectively.\"[164] Williams has won significantly more Brit Awards than any other artist, a record eighteen—Best British Male Artist four times, two awards for Outstanding Contribution to Music and the 2017 Brits Icon for his \"lasting impact on British culture\", and eight German ECHO awards.[4][165][166] In 2004, he was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame, after being voted as the Greatest artist of the 1990s.[167] He appeared in the 2009 edition of the Guinness Book of World Records when his sell-out show at the BBC Electric Proms at London's Roundhouse was screened by more than 250 cinemas across 23 countries to set a new record for the most simultaneous cinematic screenings of a live concert.[168] Williams appears in the list of the all-time Top 100 biggest selling albums in the UK six times–with four albums in the top 60.[54] In 2005, the British public voted \"Angels\" the song they would most like played at their funeral.[169] In October 2009, it was announced that he would receive the Outstanding Contribution to British Music award at the 2010 Brit Awards.[170] In September 2010, Williams switched on the Blackpool illuminations, stating that it was one of the greatest honours he had achieved.[171] In October, Media Control named Williams the most successful album-artist of the millennium due to the fact that he had spent No. 1 on the German Albums Chart for 38 weeks since 2000. He also reached that chart's Top Ten 135 times.[172] He was ranked at No. 11 the greatest frontman of all time in a reader poll by Q magazine.[173] Contemporary artists have expressed their admiration for Williams and cited him as one of their influences. The English rapper Example admitted his obsession with Williams and how he had been inspired by Williams' performances when he was younger. He described his own performance on stage as \"a combination of rap, rock and Robbie Williams\".[174][deprecated source?] Ed Sheeran, in an interview with El Hormiguero, revealed the first album he ever bought was Life Thru a Lens.[175] Olly Murs paid tribute to Williams' \"Angels\" music video in the music video for his single \"Hand on Heart\". One of Louis Tomlinson's earliest influences was Williams, of whom he declared he is a big fan.[176] In 2006, Williams emigrated to Los Angeles.[177] He briefly moved back to the UK in 2009 when he bought an £8.5 million mansion in Compton Bassett, but sold the property a year later to move back to Los Angeles. In 2016, he moved into Woodland House, a £17 million mansion in the Kensington area of London.[178] His next-door neighbour there is Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page, who has lived in The Tower House since 1972.[179] In 2018, Page delayed Williams' plans for an underground swimming pool, stating that construction work would damage The Tower House.[179][180] In 2017, he sold his mansion in Beverly Hills to DJ Khaled for $9.9 million.[181] \"Two of his biggest hits, 'Come Undone' and 'Feel,' were both exercises in melodic self loathing. It felt like a public airing of very private pain.\" Williams has reportedly battled mental illness, obesity, self-esteem issues, alcoholism, and substance abuse throughout his life.[183][184] He has discussed how his friend Elton John booked him into a clinic to cope with his drug use that emerged from the depression he was experiencing while still in Take That.[184] Williams revealed in 2011 he had been experiencing lethargy caused by a type of hormone imbalance called andropause for a number of years, and thought at first it was a return of his depression.[185][186] In a June 2020 interview with Weight Watchers Magazine, he revealed that he had developed an addiction to online golf games.[187] Williams also has dyslexia and dyscalculia.[188] Williams has a keen interest in UFOs and related paranormal phenomena, and researched the subject during his 2007–2008 sabbatical.[189] He participated in a documentary for BBC Radio 4 with Jon Ronson about the paranormal. The documentary followed them to a UFO convention in Nevada, during which Williams linked his obsession in the paranormal with the desire to understand his childhood fears of his mother's belief in \"the world's mysteries, elves, demons, [and] witchcraft\".[190] Williams featured in a 2018 TV documentary Hunt for the Skinwalker by Jeremy Corbell, and revealed that his partner Ayda Field dissuaded him from buying the Skinwalker Ranch when it became for sale.[191][192][193] Williams became an ordained minister with the Universal Ministries to officiate the wedding of friends.[194] Williams has a number of tattoos, many of which are related to British culture. These include:[195] Williams became a fan of his hometown football team Port Vale FC as a child after his father became the licensee of the team's social club.[17] He has played in a testimonial match for club legend Neil Aspin and helped to design the playing strip for the 2020–21 season.[197][198] He is also a supporter of the Carlton Football Club in the Australian Football League.[199] In 2020, Williams received backlash for defending the widely debunked Pizzagate conspiracy theory.[200][201] In 1997, Williams was in a month-long relationship with Spice Girls singer Melanie Chisholm.[202] In December 1997, he met the All Saints singer Nicole Appleton while filming Top of the Pops.[203] The following year, they started a relationship and got engaged.[204] After Appleton had an abortion, they ended their relationship in 1999.[204][205] In 2000, Williams was in a short-term relationship with Geri Halliwell who also had been in the Spice Girls.[206] In May 2006, Williams started dating American actress Ayda Field. She was featured in the UFO documentary that Williams did for BBC Radio 4[207] and took part in a field investigation he did in Trout Lake, Washington, in 2008.[208] Williams and Field wed at his home in Mulholland Estates in Beverly Hills on 7 August 2010.[209][210][211] They have four children: daughters Theodora and Colette,[212] and sons Charlton and Beau.[213] Williams's wife is Ashkenazi Jewish.[214] Williams considers his children to be Jewish.[215] There have been questions about Williams's sexuality, with some speculating that he may be bisexual.[216][217] In an interview with the Daily Star, he stated: \"I love musical theatre and a lot of the other things that are often associated with gays. I am 49% homosexual and sometimes as far as 50%. However, that would imply that I enjoy having a particular sort of fun, which I don't.\"[218] In the 2011 Sunday Times Rich List of wealthiest people in the British music industry, his wealth was estimated at £90 million. Williams is a lifelong supporter of football club Port Vale, based in his home town of Stoke-on-Trent, and in February 2006 he bought £240,000 worth of shares in the club, making him the largest shareholder.[219] However, the club entered administration on 9 March 2012, and as a result Williams lost all of his shares in the club and received only a fraction of his original investment back.[220] Williams has set up a charity in his home town of Stoke-on-Trent entitled Give It Sum, its goal being to \"improve local conditions and strengthen community life by giving money to those who are disadvantaged.\"[183][221] Williams, with the help of friend Jonathan Wilkes, has organised charity football matches called Soccer Aid to raise money for UNICEF UK. A mixture of non-football celebrities and professional football players have played Soccer Aid matches in 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 at Old Trafford, and Etihad Stadium in Manchester and Wembley Stadium, Stamford Bridge, and the London Stadium in London.[222] Williams has been the Patron of the children's charity the Donna Louise Trust, based in Stoke-on-Trent, since 2002.

                "content": "Robert Peter \"Robbie\" Williams[1] (born 13 February 1974) is an English singer and occasional actor. In the United Kingdom, he has sold more albums than any other British singer. He has sold more than 70 million records worldwide.[2] Williams performed his first songs in 1990 with the group Take That. In 1995, he left Take That to start playing and writing music on his own. On 15 July 2010, he rejoined Take That.[3][4] The group released a new album in November 2010. It became the second fastest-selling album of all time in UK chart history[5] and the fastest-selling record of the century.[6] After he left Take That, Williams' first record was the song \"Freedom,\" which was written by George Michael. His first album was called \"Life Thru a Lens\". It was first sold in September 1997. At this time, Williams had many problems with alcohol and depression. \"Angels,\" a song from his first album, became his most famous song. Because \"Angels\" was so successful,[7] the album \"Life Thru a Lens\" became much more popular, and he sold more than three million copies of it in Europe. Williams wrote \"Millennium,\" which was a song based on the music from the James Bond films, for his second album, \"I've Been Expecting You\". \"Millennium\" became his first Number one in the charts. Two more songs from the same album, \"No Regrets\" (which Williams wrote with Neil Tennant and Neil Hannon) and \"Strong\", were both successful in the United Kingdom. Another song from this album, \"She's The one\", also became a number One song. Williams was not very successful outside Europe until he made the album \"Sing When You're Winning\", which was first sold in August 2000. The song \"Rock DJ\" won many awards: for example, it was called \"Best Single (song) Of The Year\" at the BRIT Awards, and MTV gave Robbie Williams an award for the special effects in the video. At this time, Robbie Williams recorded a duet, \"Kids\", with Kylie Minogue. Many of his songs, for example, \"Supreme\" and \"Better Man\", became popular in many different countries. In 2001, Williams recorded covers (copies) of several songs that had been performed earlier by Frank Sinatra. One of these songs was a duet with Nicole Kidman, called \"Somethin' Stupid\". Later in 2001, he began to sell the album \"Swing When You're Winning\". The album became successful very quickly. Altogether he sold 7 million copies. A song from the album, \"Beyond the Sea\", was used at the end of the film \"Finding Nemo\". At this time, he also recorded a song he had written, \"Eternity\", which was not on any albums. It was very successful and became a Number one song. In 2002, Williams signed a contract to say he would work for the company EMI.[8] He worked on his next album, \"Escapology\", for a year. Many people think that \"Escapology\" was different from Williams' earlier music. The album was very successful in Europe, but it was not so successful in America. For the video for the song \"Something Beautiful\", Robbie ran a competition. The winner of the competition pretended to be Williams in the video. In the end, he chose three winners, so he made three different videos for the song. In 2004, Williams put his most popular songs together. He called this collection \"Greatest Hits\". There were also some new songs on this album, for example, \"Radio\". In February 2005, the BRIT Awards TV show asked people to vote to answer the question \"What was the best song between 1980 and 2005?\" The winner was \"Angels\" by Williams.[9] In October 2005, Williams' sixth album, \"Intensive Care\", was first sold. Williams and Steven Duffy wrote the songs for this album. At this time, four of the singers from Take That went to London for a TV show. They asked Williams to come, but he said he did not want to come to London with them. The newspaper The Sunday Mirror said that the other singers were \"gutted\" (very unhappy and disappointed) because Williams would not come. In 2006, Williams started to perform at concerts all over the world. He recorded his new song, \"Rudebox\", which was very different from his other songs. Many people did not like it, and the newspaper The Sun said that \"Rudebox\" was \"the worst song ever\".[10] The song was quite successful, but the album, which was also called \"Rudebox\", sold fewer copies than any of Williams' other albums.[11] Williams worked with Guy Chambers and Mark Ronson for his next album, Reality Killed the Video Star.[12] The album was released on 9 November 2009 in the United Kingdom.[13] On 11 October 2009 Williams published a 12-track compilation album, titled Songbook. It was a free CD for the newspaper The Mail on Sunday. The CD is a one-off album of some of his biggest hits - including several rare live performances.[14] In October 2010 Williams released his second greatest hits album, In and Out of Consciousness: The Greatest Hits 1990–2010, to celebrate 20 years as a performing artist.[15] In June 2011 Robbie Williams said he was working with Gary Barlow on a new solo album.[16] He was the opening act at the Diamond Jubilee concert held outside Buckingham Palace on 4 June 2012. Williams' ninth album Take the Crown was released on 5 November 2012. On 15 November 2013 Williams' tenth album Swings Both Ways was released. Williams lives in Los Angeles, in California.[17] He has often said that he likes Los Angeles because he can feel free and private. Williams moved back to the UK in 2009. He bought an £8.5 million mansion in Compton Bassett, Wiltshire. It was nearby to close friend Jonathan Wilkes who lives in Swindon. Williams sold the mansion a year later to move back to Los Angeles. He often has problems with alcohol, drugs and mental illness.[18][19] He has often visited special hospitals to cure his addiction to alcohol and drugs. Some people have suggested that Williams might be gay, but he says he has \"never slept with (had sexual intercourse with) a man\". In 2005, when MGN wrote an article that said Williams was gay, his lawyer made the writers give him compensation (money) because they had written libel (lies).[20] He has had relationships with many women, including TV presenter Rachel Hunter and singer Nicole Appleton. On 7 August 2010, Williams and long time girlfriend, actress Ayda Field, married at his home in Los Angeles.[21] On 30 March 2012 Williams said that he and his wife would become parents for the first time.[22] Their daughter Theodora Rose was born on 18 September 2012.[23] Studio albums as a solo artist See also Studio albums with Take That Studio albums with Lufthaus",

                "content": "Antonio Durran Pierce[1] (born October 26, 1978) is an American professional football coach and former linebacker who was most recently the head coach of the Las Vegas Raiders of the National Football League (NFL) in 2024. He previously served as the linebackers coach for the Raiders from 2022 to 2023. Pierce played nine seasons as a linebacker in the National Football League (NFL) and he won a Super Bowl playing with the New York Giants in the 2007 season. He played college football for the Arizona Wildcats and was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Washington Redskins, and later played for the Giants. In 2014, Pierce began his coaching career as the head coach at Long Beach Polytechnic High School and then served as an assistant coach at Arizona State University from 2018 to 2021. Pierce played high school football at Paramount High School in Paramount, California. As a senior for the Pirates, Pierce earned All-CIF Southern Section Division 2 accolades at linebacker while also playing at the fullback position.[2][3] He then played two years of football at Mount San Antonio College in Walnut, California, before transferring to the University of Arizona. In the fall of 1997 as a sophomore, Pierce helped lead Mt. SAC to the CCCAA state title, intercepting a pass for the Mounties in the fourth quarter of a 38–35 win over San Francisco City College.[4] As a senior at Arizona, he had three sacks, 77 tackles (ten for losses), two forced fumbles, one interception, and one blocked kick, earning All-Pac-10 honorable mention.[5] Pierce was not taken in the 2001 NFL draft after his senior year because many NFL scouts considered him too undersized to play linebacker in the NFL.[6] The Washington Redskins signed him as an undrafted free agent in 2001. He played in all 16 games as a rookie, with only eight starts. He recorded 52 tackles, one sack, and one interception during his rookie campaign. The interception came against Jake Plummer. Over the next two seasons, Pierce played sporadically, recording only 18 and 15 tackles respectively, during the 2002 and 2003 seasons. It was not until the 2004 season, his fourth in the league, that he played a full season, upon replacing the injured Micheal Barrow.[7] That season, Pierce logged a career-high 114 tackles, 95 of them solo. He also had one forced fumble, one sack, and two interceptions, including a pick off Ken Dorsey returned 76 yards for a touchdown. The New York Giants signed Pierce on March 3, 2005, to start at middle linebacker. He became the captain of the defense, and in 13 games, Pierce notched 100 tackles, 80 of them solo, two interceptions, and one forced fumble returned for a touchdown. His 2005 season ended early as he suffered a leg injury, against the Philadelphia Eagles, and missed the final three regular season games as well as the Giants' only postseason game, a 23–0 loss to the Carolina Panthers. In 2006, Pierce recorded a career-high 138 tackles (109 solo), a sack, an interception, and defended eight passes. Pierce was named as a first alternate for the Pro Bowl. He was invited to play in Hawaii after Brian Urlacher suffered a toe injury in Super Bowl XLI, and withdrew from the Pro Bowl. In the 2007 season, Pierce was a central figure in the Giants' path to their third Super Bowl title. He made a key tackle in the first half of the NFC Championship game against the Green Bay Packers, stopping running back Brandon Jackson on a screen pass on 3rd and 8,[8] saving a touchdown and forcing the Packers to settle for a field goal instead. The Giants would go on to win in overtime.[9] On the early morning hours of November 9, 2008, at a night club in New York City, Plaxico Burress accidentally discharged an unlicensed gun in his pocket, injuring his thigh.[10] No one called the police, which is required by New York law when a gunshot accident occurs. Pierce helped Burress and rushed him to a nearby hospital to tend to his injury. Pierce was then sought by the NYPD for questioning as it is against New York law not to report a shooting, which Pierce or anyone else in attendance did not do. Eventually, Pierce talked to the police and did not face charges[11] in the incident, also reiterating he didn't have any regrets for how he handled the incident. Pierce was released by the team on February 11, 2010. Following his release, Pierce announced his retirement from football on July 8, 2010. He also stated that he would then begin his career as an NFL analyst for ESPN.[12] On February 7, 2014, Pierce was named the head coach at national powerhouse Long Beach Polytechnic High School, replacing Raul Lara, who stepped down as the head coach of the program after 13 seasons.[13] After an 11–2 first season, the Jackrabbits struggled under Pierce, missing the playoffs for the first time in 36 years in his second season at the helm. The struggles continued in 2016 and 2017, with the program failing to reach double digit wins in both years and getting blown out in the playoffs. On December 21, 2017, Pierce announced his resignation as head coach and was named linebackers coach at Arizona State University. After two seasons as the Sun Devils' linebackers coach, Pierce was promoted to co-defensive coordinator alongside Marvin Lewis.[14] On January 20, 2021, Pierce was elevated to be the sole defensive coordinator at ASU after sharing the role with Marvin Lewis during the 2020 season.[15] He resigned during an NCAA recruiting violation investigation prior to 2022 season.[16] In August 2023, ASU announced a self-imposed bowl ban, hoping to lessen further penalties resulting from the ongoing investigation.[17] Following Pierce's resignation, the NCAA investigation continued, eventually determining that Pierce was the, \"ringleader in orchestrating the recruiting violations\" at ASU, and that Pierce, \"used his position of authority to pressure staff members into engaging in violations, often by instilling fear that they would lose their jobs if they did not follow his orders\".[18] This included ordering an assistant to commit recruiting tampering to attempt to land a transfer not in the transfer portal, and refusing to cooperate with the investigation.[19] Pierce's actions were described as a \"scheme\" and involved Pierce taking individuals to a gentleman's club as part of recruiting visits.[20] The NCAA levied an 8 year show-cause penalty against Pierce; should an NCAA school hire Pierce prior to 2032, he would serve a yearlong suspension.[21] In a statement regarding the penalties, ASU president Michael M. Crow declared the university to be, \"disappointed and embarrassed by the actions of certain former football staff members who took advantage of a global pandemic to hide their behavior.\"[22] In 2022, Pierce was hired by the Las Vegas Raiders as their linebackers coach under head coach Josh McDaniels.[23] On October 31, 2023, Pierce was named the interim head coach of the Raiders following the firing of head coach Josh McDaniels.[24] He named Aidan O'Connell as the starting quarterback for the rest of the season on November 1, benching Jimmy Garoppolo.[25] On November 5, 2023, Pierce made his head coaching debut against the New York Giants, for whom he had previously played. The Raiders won the game 30–6, a season high in points for the Raiders at that point[26] On December 14, 2023, the Raiders defeated the Los Angeles Chargers 63–21, scoring the most points in franchise history.[27] A week later, on Christmas Day, the Raiders recorded their first win over the Kansas City Chiefs since 2020.[28] The Raiders were eliminated from playoff contention on New Year's Eve, following a 23–20 loss to the Indianapolis Colts. On January 19, 2024, the Raiders officially named Pierce the 23rd head coach in franchise history.[29] On January 7, 2025, Pierce was fired by the Raiders, after finishing 4–13 in 2024.[30] Pierce finished his tenure in Las Vegas with a 9–17 (.346) record. * Interim head coach Pierce is married to Jocelyn and is the father of seven. He currently resides in Palos Verdes Estates, California. His father, Cleo Burrows, is from Bermuda. Inspired by his own experiences growing up in Compton, it has become Pierce's mission to improve the quality of life for the youth in the Long Beach/Compton area. For several years, Pierce has offered a free football camp for underprivileged youths.[citation needed] In 2006, Pierce became the spokesperson for Giants Academy—a program for inner city youth geared toward helping these children succeed despite obstacles in their life. He is also involved in the \"Read Across America\" program where he reads to children whose parents are undergoing treatment for chemical dependency at the Odyssey House in Harlem.[31] In 2007, Pierce received the \"United Way Man of the Year\" award and was honored by the Catholic Diocese for his support of the community. Pierce was honored at the 2008 ESPY awards along with the Giants. Pierce was present when teammate Plaxico Burress negligently shot himself in the thigh at the Latin Quarter Night Club in New York City on November 28, 2008.[32] Police say that Pierce drove Burress to the hospital and then returned home with the gun in the glove compartment of his car. The police impounded Pierce's SUV to search for blood and gunpowder residue.[33] Burress was charged with, and ultimately pleaded guilty to, criminal possession of a weapon; however Pierce was not indicted on any charges. On August 3, 2009, Pierce was cleared of all criminal charges stemming from the incident.[34] He was represented in the matter by notable NYC criminal defense attorney, Michael F. Bachner.[35] Pierce served as a communications intern on The Howard Stern Show on May 7, 2008. He stated he would like to pursue a career in broadcasting after his NFL career.[36] Near the end of the day's show he asked to stay for the remainder of the week, which Stern agreed to.[37] # denotes interim head coach",

                "content": "Editions: En/nfl/las-vegas-raiders Things are not looking good in Sin City Once again, Raiders fans and analysts are left buzzing, as the Las Vegas Raiders have decided to part ways with head coach Antonio Pierce after just one full season at the helm. The decision, announced late Monday evening and confirmed on Tuesday, follows a tumultuous 4-13 season that saw the team struggle to find its footing. Pierce, who initially took over as the interim head coach in 2023 and was later appointed the full-time role, faced numerous challenges during his tenure. The Raiders dealt with instability at the quarterback position, inconsistent performances, and injuries that hampered the team's efforts to compete in the highly competitive AFC West. Despite a late-season rally where the Raiders managed to win two of their final three games, it was not enough to secure Pierce's position. The team's overall performance fell short of expectations, leading to the decision to seek new leadership. Related: General Manager Tom Telesco retained his position but still all eyes will be on him for the rest of his tenure, how long will it be. The Raiders released a statement after letting their former head coach go after a promising start to his job a year ago. \"We appreciate Antonio's leadership, first as an interim head coach and this past season as the head coach,\" the team said in a statement. \"Antonio grew up a Raiders fan and his Silver and Black roots run deep. We are grateful for his ability to reignite what it means to be a Raider throughout the entire organization. We wish nothing but the best for Antonio and his family in the future.\" The search for a new head coach begins immediately, with the Raiders looking for a leader who can reinvigorate the team and steer them back to playoff contention. Speculation is already swirling about potential candidates, with several high-profile names being mentioned in early discussions. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved.

Antonio Pierce was named head coach of the Las Vegas Raiders on January 19, 2024, after serving as the team’s interim head coach for the last nine games of the 2023 season. Pierce led the Raiders to a 5-4 record during that time, including a 3-1 record in the AFC West, and immediately gained the respect of the players and the fans.Before being named head coach, Pierce had spent the last nine years in the coaching world – starting at the high school level, moving up to various roles at Arizona State University, and finally in the NFL with the Raiders. Pierce also had a decorated playing career spanning nine seasons, four with Washington and five with the New York Giants. Despite going undrafted, Pierce made the Pro Bowl in 2006 and became a Super Bowl champion in 2008 with the Giants. Following his retirement, Pierce joined ESPN as an NFL analyst.Pierce attended the University of Arizona where he played football for two years.

                "title": "Minnesota Timberwolves - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Minnesota Timberwolves (often referred to as the Wolves) are an American professional basketball team based in Minneapolis. The Timberwolves compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Northwest Division of the Western Conference.[8] The team was founded in 1989. Its majority owner is Glen Taylor, who also owns the WNBA's Minnesota Lynx.[9] Currently, Taylor is in a legal battle over ownership of the team with Alex Rodriguez, Marc Lore, and Michael Bloomberg.[10] The Timberwolves play their home games at Target Center, their home since 1990.[11] Like most expansion teams, the Timberwolves struggled in their early years, but after the acquisition of Kevin Garnett in the 1995 NBA draft, the team qualified for the playoffs in eight consecutive seasons from 1997 to 2004. Despite losing in the first round in their first seven attempts, the Timberwolves won their first division championship in 2004 and advanced to the Western Conference finals that same season. Garnett was also named the NBA Most Valuable Player for that season.[12] The team then went into rebuilding mode for more than a decade after missing the postseason in 2005, and trading Garnett to the Boston Celtics in 2007.[13] Garnett returned to the Timberwolves in a February 2015 trade and finished his career there, retiring in the 2016 off-season. The Timberwolves ended a 14-year playoff drought when they returned to the postseason in 2018. NBA basketball returned to the Twin Cities in 1989 for the first time since the Minneapolis Lakers (1947–1960) departed to Los Angeles in 1960. The NBA had granted one of its four new expansion teams on April 22, 1987 (the others being the Orlando Magic, Charlotte Hornets, and the Miami Heat) to original owners Harvey Ratner and Marv Wolfenson to begin play beginning in the 1989–90 season. There were two previous American Basketball Association (ABA) franchises that played in between the Lakers' departure and the Timberwolves arrival: the Minnesota Muskies (1967–68), and the Minnesota Pipers (1968–69). The Timberwolves have worn throwback uniforms for each of the previous franchises.[14][15] The franchise conducted a \"name the team\" contest[16] and eventually selected two finalists, \"Timberwolves\" and \"Polars\", in December 1986. The team then asked the 842 city councils in Minnesota to select the winner and \"Timberwolves\" prevailed by nearly 2–1.[17][18] The team was officially named the \"Minnesota Timberwolves\" on January 23, 1987. Minnesota is home to the largest population of timberwolves in the contiguous 48 states.[19] The Timberwolves debuted on November 3, 1989, losing to the Seattle SuperSonics on the road 106–94. Five days later, they made their home debut at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, losing to the Chicago Bulls 96–84. Two nights later on November 10, the Wolves got their first win, beating the Philadelphia 76ers at home 125–118. The Timberwolves, led by Tony Campbell with 23.2 ppg, went on to a 22–60 record, finishing in sixth place in the Midwest Division. Playing in the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, the expansion Timberwolves set an NBA record by drawing over 1 million fans to their home games.[20] This included a crowd of 49,551 on April 17, 1990, which saw the Timberwolves lose to the Denver Nuggets 99–88 in the final home game of the season.[21] The next season, the team moved into their permanent home, the Target Center, and improved somewhat, finishing 29–53. However, they fired their head coach, Bill Musselman. They fared far worse in the 1991–92 NBA season under Musselman's successor, ex-Celtics coach Jimmy Rodgers, finishing with an NBA-worst 15–67 record. Looking to turn the corner, the Wolves hired former Detroit Pistons general manager Jack McCloskey to the same position, but even with notable first-round selections such as Christian Laettner and Isaiah Rider, the Timberwolves were unable to duplicate McCloskey's \"Detroit Bad Boys\" success in the Twin Cities, finishing 19–63 and 20–62 the next two seasons. One of the few highlights from that era was when the Target Center served as host of the 1994 All-Star Game where Rider won the Slam Dunk Contest with his between-the-leg \"East Bay Funk Dunk\".[22] As winning basketball continued to elude the Wolves, Ratner and Wolfenson nearly sold the team to New Orleans interests in 1994 before NBA owners rejected the proposed move. Eventually, Glen Taylor bought the team and named Kevin McHale general manager. The Wolves finished 21–61 in 1994–95, and the future looked bleak.[23] In the 1995 NBA draft, the Timberwolves selected high school standout Kevin Garnett in the first round (5th overall),[24] and Flip Saunders was named head coach. Christian Laettner was traded along with Sean Rooks to the Atlanta Hawks for Andrew Lang and Spud Webb. Also, first-round pick Donyell Marshall was traded the previous season for Golden State Warriors' forward Tom Gugliotta. These trades paved the way for rookie Kevin Garnett to become the go-to player inside. Garnett went on to average 10.4 ppg in his rookie season as the Wolves finished in 5th place in the Midwest Division, with a 26–56 record.[23] In 1996, the Wolves added another star player in the draft, trading Ray Allen to the Milwaukee Bucks for the rights to Stephon Marbury, the 4th overall pick. The addition of Marbury had a positive effect on the entire team, as Garnett and Gugliotta became the first Wolves to be selected to the All-Star team. Gugliotta and Garnett led the Timberwolves in scoring as the team made the playoffs for the first time in franchise history with a record of 40–42. However, in the playoffs the Timberwolves made a quick exit as they were swept by the Houston Rockets in three straight games.[25] The T-Wolves also decided to change their image by changing their team logo and color scheme, adding black to the team colors and replacing the original logo with one featuring a snarling wolf looming over a field of trees. It was also during this season that Minnesota began to play on a parquet floor. In 1997, Garnett and Marbury established themselves as two of the brightest rising stars in the NBA. Garnett averaged 18.5 ppg and 9.6 rebounds per game, while Marbury averaged 17.7 ppg and dished out 8.6 assists per game. Despite losing leading scorer Tom Gugliotta for half the season, the Timberwolves went on to post their first winning season at 45–37, making the playoffs for the second straight season. After dropping Game 1 of the playoffs on the road to the Seattle SuperSonics, the Timberwolves won their first postseason game in Game 2, winning in Seattle 98–93. As the series shifted to Minnesota, the Timberwolves had an opportunity to pull off the upset as they won Game 3 by a score of 98–90. However, the Wolves dropped Game 4 at home as the Sonics went on to win the series in five games.[26] In 1998, a year after signing Kevin Garnett to a six-year, $126 million contract, the Timberwolves were then used as the poster child of irresponsible spending as the NBA endured a four-month lockout that wiped out much of the season. With an already cap-heavy payroll, the Wolves let Tom Gugliotta walk, partially because the team wanted to save money in order to sign Stephon Marbury to a long-term contract, and in part because Gugliotta did not want to play with the young player. This move proved unsuccessful, however, as Stephon Marbury wanted to be the biggest star on a team and subsequently forced an in-season trade by refusing a contract extension. In the three-team mid-season deal that sent Marbury to the New Jersey Nets, the Wolves got Terrell Brandon in return and a first-round draft pick in the 1999 draft (which turned out to be the sixth pick). The Wolves made the playoffs for the third straight season by finishing in fourth place with a 25–25 record. In the playoffs, the Timberwolves were beaten by the eventual champion San Antonio Spurs in four games.[27] In 1999, the Timberwolves drafted Wally Szczerbiak with the sixth pick in the draft.[28] He had a solid season, finishing third on the team in scoring with 11.6 points per game. Led by Kevin Garnett, who averaged 22.9 points per game and 11.8 rebounds per game, the Timberwolves had their first 50-win season and finished in 3rd place with a record of 50–32. However, in the playoffs the Wolves again fell in the first round, losing to the Portland Trail Blazers in four games.[29] The Wolves opened the 1999–2000 regular season with two home games against the Sacramento Kings at the Tokyo Dome on November 6 and 7. In the summer of 2000, guard Malik Sealy was killed in a car accident by a drunk driver. Sealy's number has since been retired: the number 2 jersey memorialized with Sealy's name on a banner hanging from the rafters of Target Center. It remains the only number retired by the team.[30] Also in that season, a free agent deal signed by Joe Smith was voided by the NBA, who ruled that the Timberwolves violated proper procedure in signing the contract. The league stripped the Timberwolves of five draft picks (first round 2001–2005), but it was eventually reduced to three first-round picks (2001, 2002, and 2004). The league also fined the Timberwolves $3.5 million and suspended general manager Kevin McHale for one year. Smith eventually signed with the Detroit Pistons before re-signing with the Timberwolves in 2001. Despite those setbacks, the Timberwolves made the playoffs for the fifth straight season with a 47–35 record.[31] In the playoffs, the Timberwolves were eliminated in the first round again by the San Antonio Spurs in four games in the spring of 2001.[32] A number of newcomers arrived prior to the start of the next season, including Gary Trent, Loren Woods and Maurice Evans and the return of Joe Smith. The Timberwolves started the season by winning their first six games and went on to achieve a franchise-best start of 30–10. The Timberwolves had a franchise-record 53-point win over Chicago in November. They finished with a 50–32 record: their second-ever 50-win season that was highlighted by another All-Star appearance by Garnett and a breakout season by Wally Szczerbiak, who earned his first All-Star appearance. Once again, Minnesota lost in the first round of the playoffs, where they were swept by the Dallas Mavericks in three straight games.[33] The 2002–03 season seemed to look up for the Timberwolves. Garnett had a great season where he finished second in MVP voting with 23.0 points per game and 13.4 rebounds per game and the Timberwolves finished in third place with a 51–31 record. As a result, they were awarded home-court advantage for the first time when facing the three-time defending champion Los Angeles Lakers. After losing at home in Game 1, the Timberwolves had a chance to take a 3–1 series lead heading into the 4th quarter of Game 4 in Los Angeles, but the Lakers came back to win the game and eventually won the series in six games. In the end, the Timberwolves were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs for the seventh straight year.[34] In 2003, Rob Babcock was promoted to vice-president of player personnel. He and general manager Kevin McHale made a series of strong off-season moves in an attempt to get the team over the hump and beyond the first round of the playoffs. They made two important trades, sending away forward Joe Smith and guard Terrell Brandon in a multi-player deal for Ervin Johnson, Sam Cassell and embattled guard Latrell Sprewell. They also signed sharp-shooter Fred Hoiberg, and former first overall pick Michael Olowokandi as free agents, with both becoming key contributors during the season. The Timberwolves rounded out their bench by signing veteran role players Trenton Hassell, Troy Hudson, and Mark Madsen. Despite injuries to a revitalized Olowokandi (who missed half the season) and 6th man Wally Szczerbiak (who only played in 28 games), the revamped Timberwolves became the team to beat during the 2003–04 NBA season, finishing the season as the top seed in the Western Conference with a record of 58–24. Garnett had his best season to date, and both Sprewell and Cassell had career years as well. Garnett and Cassell both made the all-star team, and after the season, Garnett was named 1st Team All NBA, and earned his first MVP award averaging 24.2 points, 13.9 rebounds and 5.0 assists per game.[35] During the 2004 NBA playoffs, the Wolves won their first-ever playoff series against the Denver Nuggets, before beating the Sacramento Kings in a hard-fought seven-game series to advance to the franchise's first Western Conference finals. Kevin Garnett leapt upon the scorer's table upon the winning Game 7 in the Sacramento series, which became one of the more iconic moments in Minnesota sports history. The Timberwolves' run ended in the Western Conference finals as the team lost to the Los Angeles Lakers. Sam Cassell injured his groin during Game 7 against the Kings, doing his infamous big balls dance after knocking down the series-clinching bucket, and as a result, played only sparingly during the Lakers series. Many around the NBA, including both Flip Saunders and Phil Jackson believe that had he been healthy, the Wolves would have advanced to the finals.[36][37] Going into the 2004–05 season, the Wolves roster remained virtually the same from the previous season; however, Babcock left to become the general manager of the Toronto Raptors, and the team was also plagued with contract disputes and the complaining of key players Latrell Sprewell, Sam Cassell, and Troy Hudson during the off-season. After a disappointing start to the season, head coach Flip Saunders was replaced by general manager and long-time friend Kevin McHale, who took over as coach for the rest of the season. Despite a strong finish, the Timberwolves missed the playoffs for the first time in eight years, by one game, to the Memphis Grizzlies, ending the season with a record of 44–38. During the 2005 off-season, McHale and the Wolves started their search for a head coach. McHale interviewed Seattle SuperSonics assistant coach Dwane Casey, San Antonio Spurs assistant P. J. Carlesimo, former coach John Lucas and Wolves assistants Randy Wittman, Sidney Lowe and Jerry Sichting, among others. On June 17, 2005, the Timberwolves hired Casey as the new head coach. It was Casey's first head coaching job, making him the Wolves' seventh head coach in their 16-year history.[38] In the 2005 draft, the Timberwolves selected Rashad McCants, a shooting guard from North Carolina with the 14th overall pick of the first round.[39] The Timberwolves also selected Bracey Wright, a guard from Indiana, with the 17th pick of the second round (47th overall).[40] During the off-season, they traded All-Star Sam Cassell and a protected future first-round draft pick to the Los Angeles Clippers for Marko Jarić and Lionel Chalmers. They also signed free agent Nikoloz Tskitishvili.[41] On January 26, 2006, the Wolves traded forward Wally Szczerbiak, centers Dwayne Jones and Michael Olowokandi, and a future first-round draft pick to the Boston Celtics. In return, they received forward-guard Ricky Davis, center Mark Blount, forward Justin Reed, guard Marcus Banks, and two second-round draft picks. In a separate trade on the same day, the Timberwolves traded Tskitishvili to the Phoenix Suns for a 2006 second-round draft pick. The Timberwolves finished 33–49, missing the playoffs for the second consecutive year.[42] In the 2006 NBA draft, the Timberwolves selected future NBA Rookie of the Year Brandon Roy with the 6th overall pick, Craig Smith with the 36th pick, forward Bobby Jones with the 37th pick and center Loukas Mavrokefalidis with the 57th pick. The Timberwolves traded Roy to the Portland Trail Blazers for Randy Foye and cash considerations. The Timberwolves then traded Bobby Jones to the Philadelphia 76ers for a 2007 second-round pick and cash. On January 23, McHale fired head coach Casey and replaced him with Randy Wittman. McHale explained in a news conference that it was inconsistency by Casey that led to the firing. Casey had compiled an overall record of 53–69. They finished the 2006–07 season with a record of 32–50, allowing them to keep their 2007 first-round pick.[43] On July 31, 2007, the Minnesota Timberwolves reached a deal to trade All-Star Kevin Garnett to the Boston Celtics for Al Jefferson, Theo Ratliff, Gerald Green, Sebastian Telfair, Ryan Gomes, two first-round draft picks, and cash considerations. This is the largest combination of players and picks ever traded for a single player in NBA history.[44][45] Garnett and the Celtics went on to win the 2008 NBA Finals in six games over the Los Angeles Lakers. That summer, the Timberwolves traded Mike James and Justin Reed to the Houston Rockets for Juwan Howard.[46] In October of the same year, the Timberwolves waived Howard after reaching a contractual buyout agreement, worth $10 million of roughly $14.25 million which Minnesota would have owed him. The team also traded Ricky Davis and Mark Blount to the Miami Heat in exchange for the Heat's Antoine Walker, Michael Doleac, Wayne Simien, and a 2008 protected first-round draft pick. In the 2007 NBA draft the Timberwolves selected Corey Brewer, with the 7th pick, and Chris Richard with the 41st overall pick, both being from the two-time NCAA national champion Florida Gators.[47] Minnesota began the NBA preseason with two games in London and Istanbul, as part of NBA Europe Live 2007. On October 10, The Wolves lost to Garnett and the revamped Celtics, 92–81. To start the season, the Wolves began 0–5 before ending the drought with a home win over the Sacramento Kings. That drought also brought about speculation of the possible dismissal of coach Wittman. The youngest team in the NBA began adjusting to life after trading franchise star Garnett to Boston, meanwhile playing without budding talent Randy Foye for the first half of the season. Guards Sebastian Telfair and Marko Jarić were deputized as starting point guards during Foye's injury absence. The Timberwolves finished the season 22–60.[48] On a handful of occasions during the season, the team showed flashes of its potential in wins or very close contests with top-tier teams. In the 2008 NBA draft, the Timberwolves selected O. J. Mayo of USC with the third overall pick. When the draft concluded, the Timberwolves traded Mayo, Antoine Walker, Greg Buckner, and Marko Jarić to the Memphis Grizzlies in exchange for fifth overall pick Kevin Love, Mike Miller, Jason Collins, and Brian Cardinal in a move that Jim Stack called, \"a deal we couldn't pass up.\"[49] In 2008, in celebration of the franchise's 20th anniversary, the team unveiled an updated version of its logo and uniforms.[50] The new designs first appeared in the first preseason game against the Chicago Bulls at United Center on October 14, 2008. They also refurbished the floor at Target Center, returning to the traditional floor pattern and added touches of varnish while exposing most of the hardwood. On December 8, 2008, after a 23-point loss to the Los Angeles Clippers that dropped the team to 4–15, the Timberwolves fired head coach Wittman and McHale took over. McHale also relinquished his vice president of basketball operations duties. It was unclear whether McHale's future with the team was dependent on the success or progress of the team which he had put together over the previous four years. Those questions seemed to be answered when the Timberwolves went 10–4 for the month of January, giving McHale the coach of the month honors. But on February 8, 2009, the team's main star Al Jefferson tore his ACL in his right knee in a game at New Orleans, sidelining him for the rest of the season. At the time of the injury, Jefferson was having his best season to date, averaging 23 points, 11 rebounds and 2 blocks.[51] Without Jefferson and Corey Brewer (who also suffered a season-ending injury), the Wolves sputtered, to finish with a 24–58 record.[52] On June 17, 2009, new president of basketball operations David Kahn announced that McHale would not be returning to the team as head coach. Kahn did not give a specific reason for McHale's dismissal, only saying \"this is going to be a transition period.\" For his part, McHale said he wanted to come back but was not offered a contract. Later, in August, the Timberwolves announced the signing of Kurt Rambis, then an assistant for the Los Angeles Lakers, to a four-year, $8 million contract to be their new head coach. In Rambis's first season, the team stumbled to the second-worst record in the league, as their 15–67 record was only surpassed by that of the New Jersey Nets, who finished at 12–70.[53] On July 12, 2010, Minnesota traded for Miami Heat forward Michael Beasley, the second pick from the 2008 NBA draft.[54] In a locally untelevised game on November 12, 2010, Kevin Love grabbed a franchise-record 31 rebounds and scored 31 points in a win over the New York Knicks, the NBA's first 30–30 game in 28 years.[55] Love was later named an All Star for the 2010–11 NBA season, the franchise's first All Star selection since Kevin Garnett in 2007. Love would later break Garnett's team record of 37 straight double-doubles on February 8, 2011, in a win over the Houston Rockets. On March 8, 2011, Love acquired his 52nd straight double-double, surpassing the mark of Moses Malone for the most consecutive double-doubles since the NBA-ABA merger in a win over the Indiana Pacers. The streak eventually reached 53 games and came to an end with a six-point, 12-rebound performance in a 100–77 loss to the Golden State Warriors on March 13. In October 2011, Love was ranked 16th among active players by ESPN.[56] On February 21, 2011, Corey Brewer and Kosta Koufos were traded to the New York Knicks and Denver Nuggets respectively for Knicks Anthony Randolph and Eddy Curry (plus $3 million in cash from New York and a 2015 second-round draft pick from Denver) as part of a larger trade that sent all-star Carmelo Anthony from Denver to New York.[57] On the downside, with a 121–102 loss to the Houston Rockets, the Timberwolves fell to 17–65, finishing last in the Western Conference for the second straight year. They also clinched the 2010–11 NBA season's worst record. During the off-season, the Timberwolves were finally able to bring 2009 fifth overall pick Ricky Rubio over from Spain. In the 2011 NBA draft, with the second overall pick, the Timberwolves selected Derrick Williams of Arizona. The Timberwolves then traded guard Jonny Flynn and the draft rights to Donatas Motiejūnas (No. 20) to the Houston Rockets for center Brad Miller, the draft rights to Nikola Mirotić (No. 23), Chandler Parsons (No. 38) and a future first-round pick. The Timberwolves traded Mirotic's rights to the Chicago Bulls for the rights to Norris Cole (No. 28) and Malcolm Lee (No. 43). The Timberwolves then sold the rights to Parsons back to the Rockets. The Timberwolves traded Norris Cole (No. 28) to the Miami Heat for the draft rights to Bojan Bogdanovic (No. 31), a future second-round pick and cash considerations. The Timberwolves then traded Bogdanovic's rights to the New Jersey Nets for a future second-rounder and cash. The Trail Blazers traded the draft rights to Tanguy Ngombo (No. 57) to the Timberwolves.[58] On July 12, 2011, Kurt Rambis was fired as coach of the team after compiling a 32–132 record in two seasons with the team. On September 13, 2011, the team announced that they had hired Rick Adelman to be the team's new head coach.[59][60] The Timberwolves began the 2011–12 NBA season with a 17–17 record before the All-Star break.[61] On March 9, 2012, Rubio tore his left ACL and LCL in a collision with Kobe Bryant. The injury ended his season and severely hurt the Timberwolves' chances of making the playoffs. Despite being in contention at mid-season, the team ultimately failed to reach the postseason for the eighth straight year due to injuries to a number of key players.[62][63][64] The team finished with a record of 26–40, with the only win of the team's final 14 games coming against the Detroit Pistons. The team traded the 18th overall pick of the 2012 NBA draft to the Houston Rockets for Chase Budinger.[65][66][67][68] On June 26, 2012, the Timberwolves selected Robbie Hummel with the 58th overall pick, the team's only selection during the draft.[69] During the off-season, the team signed former Timberwolves draft pick Brandon Roy to a two-year, $10 million contract.[70] The deal was announced on July 31.[71] With the inclusion of Roy in the shooting guard position, players that also signed during the off-season included Andrei Kirilenko, Alexey Shved and Louis Amundson. While technically in playoff contention early, multiple injuries began to plague the team. Roy, Budinger, Lee and free-agent signing Josh Howard succumbed to knee injuries. The mood of despair was shortly lifted by the splashy return of Rubio.[72] But not long after, Love, who missed the first nine games of the season after fracturing the third and fourth metacarpals in his right hand in a preseason home workout, suffered a recurrence of the injury in a win over the Denver Nuggets on January 3.[73] One of the few highlights in the second half of the season was Rubio's triple-double performance during a surprising win over the then-first place San Antonio Spurs, albeit without Spurs stars Tony Parker and Tim Duncan playing due to injury.[74] On April 6, in a game against the Detroit Pistons, Adelman won his 1000th game as a head coach.[75] This season marked the first time the franchise had won at least 30 games without Kevin Garnett on the roster.[76] The team decided to part ways with David Kahn after the season ended, with Flip Saunders being brought in to replace him.[77] In the 2013 NBA draft, the team traded the 9th overall pick Trey Burke for Shabazz Muhammad (14th pick) and Gorgui Dieng (21st pick) in the first round from the Utah Jazz.[78] On March 28, 2014, the Timberwolves set a franchise record for points in a regular season game with a 143–107 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. The win also marked the Timberwolves' first season-series win over the Lakers since the 2005–06 season.[79] The team accumulated 40 wins for the first time since the 2004–05 season, but missed the playoffs for the tenth consecutive year, despite holding the league's highest point differential at the end of the season.[80] On April 21, 2014, Rick Adelman announced his retirement from coaching in the NBA. Adelman acquired a 97–133 record in three seasons with the team. On August 23, 2014, the Timberwolves, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Philadelphia 76ers agreed on a three-way trade that would send Kevin Love to the Cavaliers to join LeBron James and Kyrie Irving. Minnesota received Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, Thaddeus Young, and a trade exception as part of the deal. The 76ers received Alexey Shved, Luc Mbah a Moute, and a 2015 first-round pick via the Miami Heat.[81] The 2014–15 season marked a new era for the Timberwolves, beginning with the Kevin Love trade. Flip Saunders was promoted to head coach, making it his second stint with the Timberwolves after coaching the team from 1995 to 2005. The Timberwolves started the new season with a 105–101 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies, with Wiggins making his debut. The team recorded its first win the following game, a 97–91 victory over the Detroit Pistons.[82] On November 12, 2014, the Timberwolves played an international home game at Mexico City Arena against the Houston Rockets. The Timberwolves had a 16–66 record for the season and missed the playoffs for the 11th consecutive year. Despite this, Wiggins was selected as the NBA Rookie of the Year, the first player in franchise history to be so honored. Draft pick Zach LaVine gained league notoriety after winning the Slam Dunk Contest. LaVine and Wiggins, dubbed \"The Bounce Brothers\", were seen as being the future of the franchise.[83] Due to having the worst record in the NBA for the 2014–15 season, the Timberwolves had the highest chance, at 25%, to receive the first pick in the 2015 NBA draft at the 2015 NBA draft lottery. On May 19, the Timberwolves received the first overall pick in the 2015 NBA draft for the first time in franchise history. On June 25, the Timberwolves selected Karl-Anthony Towns as the number one pick and acquired Minnesota's own Tyus Jones through a trade with the Cleveland Cavaliers. The 2015 season also saw the return of Kevin Garnett. In February, Garnett, at the time with the Brooklyn Nets, waived his no-trade clause to enable a trade back to Minnesota which sent Thaddeus Young to Brooklyn. In his first game back, Garnett resumed wearing the No. 21 jersey that had not been worn by any other Timberwolves player since his departure and the team defeated the Washington Wizards 97–77 at the Target Center. On June 6, 2014, Flip Saunders was named the head coach of the Minnesota Timberwolves, returning to the franchise for a second stint.[84] During his second stint with the Timberwolves, Saunders was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. As a result, during his recovery, he would delegate his coaching position over to assistant coach and former NBA Coach of the Year winner Sam Mitchell. On October 25, 2015, Saunders died at age 60. Mitchell took over as head coach. In honor of Saunders, the team announced that they would wear a patch reading \"FLIP\" on their uniforms for the duration of the 2015–16 season.[85] On April 20, 2016, the Timberwolves agreed to sign Tom Thibodeau to be their head coach and president of basketball operations. He was previously an assistant coach for the team from 1989 to 1991.[86] On September 23, 2016, Kevin Garnett announced his retirement after 21 seasons in the NBA. He expressed interest in playing one more year for the Timberwolves but felt that his knees would be unable to hold up for the duration of the season. The Timberwolves ended their season with a 31–51 record, having only a two-game improvement from their previous season. On June 22, 2017, the Timberwolves acquired Jimmy Butler and the 16th overall pick in the 2017 draft in trade for Zach Lavine, Kris Dunn and the 7th overall pick in the draft (used to select Lauri Markkanen).[87] This trade marked the end of the LaVine and Wiggins duo, dubbed \"Bounce Brothers\". Later that night, the Timberwolves selected center Justin Patton with the 16th overall pick in the draft. Later, the team added Taj Gibson, Jeff Teague, Jamal Crawford and Derrick Rose during free agency. The Timberwolves ended their season with a 47–35 record, which became the first winning season since the 2004–05 season, and secured the last spot in the playoffs on the final day of the regular season with a 112–106 win over the Denver Nuggets. The 2017–18 season also ended the longest streak without a playoff appearance at 13 seasons. The Timberwolves would be eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Houston Rockets in five games. On November 12, 2018, the Timberwolves traded Butler and Justin Patton to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for Robert Covington, Dario Šarić, Jerryd Bayless and a 2022 second-round draft pick.[88] On January 6, 2019, Thibodeau was fired as head coach and president of basketball operations. After Thibodeau's firing, it was announced that Ryan Saunders would serve as interim head coach until a permanent head coach is found.[89] On May 1, it was announced that the Timberwolves had hired Gersson Rosas, who previously served as the Houston Rockets' executive vice president of basketball operations, as their new president of basketball operations.[90] On May 20, after conducting interviews with several candidates, the Timberwolves announced that Ryan Saunders had been hired to a multi-year deal to become the team's permanent head coach, removing his \"interim\" status.[91][92] With Rosas' hiring, the Timberwolves also made several front office changes in the organization. The Timberwolves held both a first- and second-round draft pick in the 2019 NBA draft. The 11th pick (which was Cameron Johnson) along with Dario Šarić was traded to the Suns in exchange for the 6th pick in Jarrett Culver, a small forward from Texas Tech. With the 43rd pick, the Timberwolves selected Jaylen Nowell, a point guard from Washington. They would also sign Naz Reid, and undrafted center from Louisiana State.[93] On February 6, 2020, The Timberwolves traded Andrew Wiggins to the Golden State Warriors for Karl-Anthony Towns' longtime friend D'Angelo Russell. At the season's end the Timberwolves got the 1st pick in the 2020 NBA draft.[94] With that pick, the team drafted Anthony Edwards out of Georgia.[95] In that same draft, they would trade up to select Jaden McDaniels with the 28th pick.[96] On February 21, 2021, head coach Ryan Saunders was fired, and Toronto Raptors assistant coach Chris Finch was hired to replace him.[97][98] The Timberwolves finished the season 23-49 and missed the playoffs.[99] In April 2021, the Timberwolves announced that owner Glen Taylor had reached a deal with Marc Lore and Alex Rodriguez to sell the team. According to the deal, Lore and Rodriguez would become majority owners over the course of two years. On July 21, 2021, it was announced that Lore and Rodriguez had purchased 20% of the team. They went on to purchase 20% more in 2022 before the deal stalled in 2024. The transaction also includes ownership in the Timberwolves' WNBA sister-club, the Minnesota Lynx.[100] The deal valued the team at $1.5 billion.[101] In the off-season the Wolves traded guard Ricky Rubio to the Cleveland Cavaliers for forward Taurean Prince.[102] The Wolves then acquired guard Patrick Beverley in exchange for Juancho Hernangomez and former first round pick Jarrett Culver.[103] The final move they made was signing former 2020 draft pick Leandro Bolmaro to a 4-year, 11.8-million-dollar rookie contract.[104] On September 22, 2021, after Gersson Rosas was relieved of his President of Basketball Operations duties,[105] Sachin Gupta was promoted as the new interim president of basketball operations, while keeping his role as EVP of basketball operations.[106] The Timberwolves finished the 2021–22 season with a 46–36 record, the second-most regular season wins since making the conference finals in 2004. Despite All-Star Karl-Anthony Towns fouling out with 11 points in 24 minutes, the Wolves beat the Los Angeles Clippers in the play-in game to secure their spot in the 2022 NBA playoffs. The Timberwolves were eliminated by the Memphis Grizzlies in the first round in six games.[107] On May 23, 2022, it was announced that the Timberwolves had hired Tim Connelly, who previously served as the Denver Nuggets' president of basketball operations, as their president of basketball operations, taking over Gupta's job. He was reportedly signed to a 5-year, $40 million contract by the Timberwolves, that includes ownership equity.[108] On July 1, 2022, the Timberwolves traded Malik Beasley, Patrick Beverley, Jarred Vanderbilt, Leandro Bolmaro, and 2022 22nd pick Walker Kessler and 4 future first round draft picks for 3x NBA DPOY Rudy Gobert from the Utah Jazz.[109] The Timberwolves began the 2022–23 season with high expectations following the Gobert trade. They were dealt a blow on November 28, 2022, when Karl-Anthony Towns suffered a severe calf strain that cost him 52 games.[110] The injury pushed Anthony Edwards into a leadership role,[111] with the first-time All-Star guiding the team to a 42–40 finish and a play-in tournament berth. After falling to the Los Angeles Lakers in the first game, the Timberwolves secured the 8th seed with a 25-point win over the Oklahoma City Thunder.[112] They went on to lose to the first seed (and eventual NBA champion), the Denver Nuggets, in the first round in five games.[113] The 2023–24 season was their best since 2004, as they recorded 56 wins and landed the third seed in the Western Conference. They were the no. 1 defense in the league,[114] anchored by eventual DPOY winner Rudy Gobert and All-Defensive selection Jaden McDaniels. Anthony Edwards made his first All-NBA Team, Karl-Anthony Towns made his fourth All-Star Appearance, and fan favorite[115] Naz Reid was named Sixth Man of the Year.[116] On March 28, 2024, Glen Taylor announced that the sale of the team to prospective owners Marc Lore and Alex Rodriguez was off.[117] Lore and Rodriguez were expected to make their third and final payment installment to Taylor on March 27, 2024, raising their ownership interest from 40% to 80% in both the Timberwolves and Lynx, stemming from the April 2021 agreement to purchase the team.[118] However, Lore and Rodriguez's payment was not made by the deadline. It is unclear what exactly transpired leading to the deal falling through. On March 20, 2024, it was reported the Lore and Rodriguez lost the financial backing of the Carlyle Group that had previously pledged $300 million towards the final installment.[119] On March 21, 2024, it appeared as if Lore and Rodriguez had secured the backing of Blue Owl Capital to keep the sale on track.[120] Lore and Rodriguez state they filed the necessary paperwork for league approval prior to the March 27, 2024, payment deadline, which should have granted them a ninety-day extension to submit the funds to Taylor.[118] The parties met to mediate the dispute on May 1, 2024, but no agreement was reached.[118] On June 6, 2024, it was announced that Michael Bloomberg would join Rodriguez and Lore's ownership group.[121] In the first round of the 2024 playoffs, the Timberwolves swept the Phoenix Suns 4–0. It was their first series win since 2004, and the first series sweep in Minnesota men's professional sports history. The series saw Anthony Edwards ascend into rarefied air, becoming the 2nd player under 22 to record a 30/5/5 statline in multiple playoff games.[122] His performance spurred widespread comparisons to a young Michael Jordan,[123] even from Jordan himself.[124] In the conference semifinals, the Timberwolves squared off with the Denver Nuggets in a highly anticipated rematch of their 2023 first round series. After a nailbiter Game 1, the teams spent the next five games trading blowouts, leaving things 3–3 heading back to Denver for Game 7. Down 15 points at half, the Timberwolves led a miraculous comeback, winning the game 98–90 and securing a spot in the Western Conference finals — 20 years to the day of their last conference finals appearance.[125] Their run ended when they lost to the Dallas Mavericks in five games.[126] In the 2024 NBA Draft, they traded up to select Kentucky guard Rob Dillingham with the 8th pick.[127] During the 2024 offseason, the Timberwolves traded All-Star Karl-Anthony Towns to the New York Knicks for fellow big man All-Star Julius Randle, sharpshooter Donte DiVincenzo and a first round pick, ending an era for the Timberwolves.[128] Reigning Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert was signed to a 3-year, $110 million extension.[129] In their inaugural season in 1989, the Timberwolves (or \"Wolves\" as it said on their jerseys) debuted blue road uniforms with green lettering and numbers with white. Their home uniforms featured blue lettering and numbers with green outlining. The creation of both uniforms was led by head designer, Brian Mulligan.[130] There was going to be a green alternate jersey with blue lettering to go with the uniforms, but the idea was dropped. It would've followed a similar move the Dallas Mavericks took when they switched back to blue in the early 1990s, opting the Wolves a chance to use green for a jersey color instead.[130] The Timberwolves would resurrect the blue uniforms from this era during the 2009–10 season, as part of the franchise's 20th anniversary.[131] After drafting Kevin Garnett, the Timberwolves design team, under guidance from Brian Mulligan, changed their uniforms in 1996.[130] This time, the team added black and gray to the mix, and changing to a darker shade of blue.[130] The front of the jerseys then said the team's full name \"Timberwolves\" in a different font. For the 1997–98 season, a black alternate uniform was introduced. Those uniforms were used until the 2007–08 season.[130] The Timberwolves unveiled a new alternate logo on June 25, 2008.[132] The uniforms changed again in the 2008 off-season, this time with the road jerseys reading \"Minnesota\" and the home jerseys reading \"Wolves\", similar to that of the team's early years. Both uniforms had green, black, gray and blue on the pits and sides of the shorts.[133] The Timberwolves unveiled modified uniforms on August 16, 2010. The new uniforms eliminated the green from the collar, jersey and shorts, and the team also adjusted its number font again.[134] On November 23, 2010, the Timberwolves unveiled a black alternate uniform.[135][136] On November 27, 2013, the team changed their black road alternate jersey to a short sleeved jersey. The change came about due to the NBA's introduction of sleeved jerseys.[137] On April 11, 2017, the team unveiled a new logo to coincide with the massive roster turnaround of the past few years.[138][4] The Timberwolves revealed four new uniforms for the 2017–18 season as a part of a Nike-sponsored, league-wide initiative to redesign team uniforms.[139][140] All four uniforms used \"Wolves\" for the team name and included the Nike Swoosh and Fitbit logos. The Association Edition uniform, revealed on August 10, 2017, consisted of a white uniform with navy and blue stripes and lettering.[139][141] The Icon Edition uniform, which was revealed alongside its Association counterpart, has a navy body with white stripes and lettering.[139][141] On September 15, the Timberwolves revealed their Statement Edition uniform which is primarily neon green with navy stripes, navy lettering for the team and player names, and white text with a navy stroke for the jersey numbers.[142][143] The City Edition uniform, which is primarily gray with white lettering, was the last to be revealed on December 27.[144][145] On August 30, 2018, the Timberwolves unveiled their first \"Classic\" edition uniforms based on the black alternates used from 1997 to 2008.[146] They also unveiled a dark purple \"City\" uniform inspired by Prince's 1984 album Purple Rain, as well as a white \"Earned\" version that was exclusive only to the 16 teams that made the 2018 playoffs.[147][148] The Timberwolves' 2019–20 \"City\" uniform, which was unveiled on November 20, 2019, featured a sky blue base with white letters and trim that paid homage to the waters of the Mississippi River and the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area (the \"Twin Cities\").[149] For the 2020–21 season, the Timberwolves' \"City\" uniform paid homage to the North Star, featuring a midnight black base and aurora green trim. A green star is affixed below the neckline and above the abbreviation \"MINN\" in gray.[150] As part of the NBA's 75th anniversary, the Timberwolves' \"City\" uniform in the 2021–22 season mixed various elements from the franchise's previous uniforms. The royal blue base recalled the original 1989–1996 uniforms. The tree accents and lettering visually honored the 1996–2008 uniforms. The dark blue accents were inspired by the 2017–18 \"City\" uniforms. The original 1989–1996 logo was placed on the right leg, while the current logo was affixed on the left leg.[151] Beginning with the 2022–23 season, the Timberwolves unveiled a new \"Statement\" uniform, relegating neon green to trim color and featured a dark gray base. The full name \"Timberwolves\" was featured in front along with green-trimmed gray numbers.[152] Also during the season, a new \"City\" uniform was unveiled, featuring a white base, black letters and stripes, and rainbow palette to represent Minnesota's colorful community.[153] The \"City\" uniform in the 2023–24 season featured a mostly blue base with white lake water gradients; the design represented the fun summertime activities of Minnesota's citizens, from camping to fishing and swimming.[154] A special alternate court for the 2023 NBA in-season tournament was also unveiled to go with this uniform, featuring a light blue base with a lakewater blue strip in the middle.[155] Also for the season, the Timberwolves brought back the original 1989–1996 white uniform for its \"Classic\" edition, this to celebrate the franchise's 35th season. This was paired with a modernized version of the original court used at the Target Center.[156] The 2024–25 \"City\" uniform served as the inverse of last season's \"City\" uniform, this time with a mostly white base, ice blue gradients and black accents. The design was meant to capture Minnesota's winter landscape, with white and ice blue gradients representing the state's frozen lakes during winter.[157] Crunch the Wolf is the official mascot of the Minnesota Timberwolves, According to the team's official website, \"Crunch was born in the northernmost part of Minnesota’s wilderness areas. Deep in the forest, he grew with a love for something never before seen by others in his pack. Crunch's love for the game of basketball puzzled his mother and father, for he seemed to pick up the game on his own. With a makeshift basket built of pine-cones and birch bark, Crunch began to refine his game when he was still just a young pup. He learned the rules and techniques that make the game of basketball so great. He studied players and coaches alike, and soon would find himself on a journey like no other. Years later, when Minnesota’s expansion team, the Timberwolves, came to town, Crunch said goodbye to all he had known growing up in the woods, and migrated south to the Twin Cities where the team was to be based. No one is quite sure where Crunch lives, but legend has it he has a den somewhere deep inside the Target Center. He is lured out on game-days by the deafening howl made by Wolves fans. This howl creates an atmosphere in the Target Center that reminds Crunch of his days back in the forest, and yet keeps him here in Minneapolis, with the pursuit of helping the team to a victory.\"[158] List of the last five seasons completed by the Timberwolves. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Minnesota Timberwolves seasons. Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W–L% = Winning percentage Roster Last transaction: January 3, 2025 The Timberwolves hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.[159] This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. As of 2023, the Minnesota Timberwolves air all of their games on the iHeartRadio app, with select games airing on KFXN-FM 100.3 FM within the Twin Cities.[166] WCCO had been the team's radio home from 2011 until the end of the 2022–23 season.[167] Before that, KFAN/KFXN had been the Timberwolves' Twin Cities flagship station since the team's inception, except for a brief two-year hiatus to KLCI BOB 106.1 FM for the 2006–07 and 2007–08 seasons. Alan Horton has been the team's radio play-by-play announcer since the 2007–08 season.[168] The Timberwolves' games are broadcast primarily on Bally Sports North. But if the Minnesota Twins and Minnesota Wild occupy both Bally Sports North and Bally Sports North Extra, the game will be aired on WUCW as Bally Sports North Extra on The CW Twin Cities, and the Bally Sports app for viewers outside of WUCW's coverage area.[169] The broadcasters are Michael Grady and Jim Petersen.[170][171][172] 2022–2023",

Share sensitive information only on official, secure websites. Related Topics: January 6, 2025 -- CDC is saddened by Louisiana's report that a person previously hospitalized with severe avian influenza A(H5N1) illness (\"H5N1 bird flu\") has passed away. While tragic, a death from H5N1 bird flu in the United States is not unexpected because of the known potential for infection with these viruses to cause severe illness and death. As of January 6, 2025, there have been 66 confirmed human cases of H5N1 bird flu in the United States since 2024 and 67 since 2022. This is the first person in the United States who has died as a result of an H5 infection. Outside the United States, more than 950 cases of H5N1 bird flu have been reported to the World Health Organization; about half of those have resulted in death. CDC has carefully studied the available information about the person who died in Louisiana and continues to assess that the risk to the general public remains low. Most importantly, no person-to-person transmission spread has been identified. As with the case in Louisiana, most H5 bird flu infections are related to animal-to-human exposures. Additionally, there are no concerning virologic changes actively spreading in wild birds, poultry, or cows that would raise the risk to human health. (CDC reported previously on its analysis of the viruses isolated from the patient in Louisiana.) However, people with job-related or recreational exposures to infected birds or other animals are at greater risk of infection. For these and others, CDC has developed prevention resources about how to protect yourself. CDC is continually: Additional information about H5 bird flu is available on the CDC website. ### U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Whether diseases start at home or abroad, are curable or preventable, chronic or acute, or from human activity or deliberate attack, CDC’s world-leading experts protect lives and livelihoods, national security and the U.S. economy by providing timely, commonsense information, and rapidly identifying and responding to diseases, including outbreaks and illnesses.

                "content": "Facebook Twitter Print Email A day after the United States reported its first human death from avian flu, the UN World Health Organization (WHO) insisted on Tuesday that the risk to the wider population remains “low”. WHO spokesperson Dr. Margaret Harris told reporters in Geneva that the H5N1 virus causing the disease is “not circulating in humans but jumping into humans” who are exposed to poultry or dairy cattle. “We’re not seeing sustained circulation,” she insisted. The man who died of the disease in Louisiana was over 65 and reportedly had underlying medical conditions, Dr. Harris said. According to the health authorities, he had been exposed to chickens and wild birds. Several dozen people in the US have contracted avian influenza – commonly referred to as bird flu – during the current outbreak, mainly farmworkers in close contact with poultry flocks and cattle herds. Dr. Harris stressed that WHO’s assessment of the risk to the general population “is still low and remains set”. The main concern is for people who work in animal industries because they need to be better protected from infection. The WHO spokesperson added that the United States was continuing to carry out “a lot of surveillance” in the human and animal population, “in the methods we use for farming, for our food production…all those things need to be combined because indeed it always does pose a risk”. Meanwhile, a respiratory virus gaining ground in China, known as the human metapneumovirus, or hMPV, has been sparking media attention in recent weeks, but it does not represent a new or major threat, Dr. Harris insisted. The UN health agency spokesperson said that such infections are on the rise in China “as expected during winter”, with seasonal influenza being “by far the most common among them”, as reported by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. “China’s reported levels of respiratory infections are within the usual range for the winter season,” Dr. Harris explained. “Authorities report that hospital utilization is currently lower than this time last year, and there have been no emergency declarations or responses triggered,” she added. As for hMPV, it was first identified in 2001 and “has been in the human population for a long time”, Dr. Harris clarified. She added that it is a common virus that circulates in winter and spring and usually “causes respiratory symptoms similar to the common cold”. Like any of the hundreds of common cold viruses known to exist, it can lead to more serious disease in patients with low immunity, particularly but not limited to newborns and the elderly. Asked about hMPV’s mortality rate, Dr. Harris described it as “very, very low”. It is not a pathogen that normally leads to deaths in humans, save for the most vulnerable, she concluded, recommending “simple” prevention measures, such as wearing a mask, improving ventilation of closed spaces and handwashing.

                "content": "ugurerden / iStock The Louisiana Department of Health (LDH) today announced that a patient previously hospitalized with a severe H5N1 avian flu infection has died. The patient is older than age 65 and had underlying health conditions. Officials had said the person was exposed to the virus through contact with backyard poultry and wild birds. So far, LDH investigators haven't found any other related cases. The news comes as US officials note more avian flu in poultry and in both domestic and wild cats. \"The Department expresses its deepest condolences to the patient's family and friends as they mourn the loss of their loved one,\" the LDH said. \"Due to patient confidentiality and respect for the family, this will be the final update about the patient.\" The United States has reported 66 human H5N1 cases since the start of 2024. Most have been mild infections from a genotype circulating in dairy herds. A different genotype carried by wild birds migrating south, however, is posing another threat and has resulted in two severe infections, one of them involving the Louisiana patient and the other a British Columbia teen who is recovering after lengthy intensive care unit treatment. In related news, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) today confirmed more H5N1 avian flu outbreaks in poultry in five states, which include commercial farms in three of them. In Delaware, an outbreak was confirmed at a broiler farm in Kent County that has 125,000 birds, marking the state's first detections in poultry since September 2022. Other states reporting outbreaks at commercial facilities include hard-hit California, which reported new detections at a game bird farm in Butte County that has 44,700 birds, as well as a broiler operation and layer farm in Stanislaus County. In Michigan, the virus was found at two more turkey farms in Ottawa County. The USDA also confirmed the virus in backyard flocks in Arkansas's Sharp County and at four locations in Idaho's Canyon County. APHIS today also confirmed two more outbreaks in dairy cattle, both in California, raising the national total to 917 and the state's total to 701. Also, APHIS today added about 30 more H5N1 detections in mammals, mostly in cat species. The virus was confirmed in 4 domestic cats in California, 3 in Los Angeles County and 1 in Fresno County. The virus also struck a house cat in Washington County, Oregon, and Morrison County, Minnesota. Over the past few weeks, California has reported a few cat deaths in animals exposed to raw pet food and raw milk. Some of the newly reported detections involved wild cats, including a bobcat from Colorado's Larimer County and a mountain lion near Carson City, Nevada. Several of the animals that tested positive appear to be exotic captive wild cats at a sanctuary in Washington's Mason County. Also, there were five other exotic cats that tested positive near Denver, Colorado, as well as a few in California and Idaho. Detections in other mammals include a fox near Denver and a raccoon in Washington's King County. Eighteen workers with blastomycosis were hospitalized (12%), and 1 patient died. Though the reports yield timely, useful clues, experts note important lessons, lingering questions, and concerns about preparedness. Louisiana officials confirm that a patient previously hospitalized with a severe H5N1 avian flu infection has died. Health departments in 14 states reported 91 norovirus outbreaks in the first week of December. Flu hospitalizations are rising in all age-groups, with high or very high levels in 42 states. Under 7% of dialysis patients are current with COVID vaccines, underscoring the need for antiviral treatments for patients with kidney disease. Though testing can't pinpoint a source, recent detections in Arizona have involved only the wild bird genotype. Meanwhile, several states report more poultry outbreaks, Ohio issues a wild-bird alert, and the FDA announces a plan to test raw milk cheese. From 2011 to 2022, average annual incidence of the rare bacterial zoonotic disease increased by 56% over the previous surveillance period. A study in Denmark shows that kids who have a lot of common infections early in life have a higher risk of moderate to severe infections and antibiotic use throughout childhood.

                "content": "Gerald Norman Springer (February 13, 1944 – April 27, 2023) was an American broadcaster, journalist, actor, lawyer, and politician.[1] He was best known for hosting the controversial tabloid talk show Jerry Springer from 1991 to 2018. Springer was noted as a pioneer in the emergence of \"trash TV\"; his eponymous show was a \"commercial smash and certifiable cultural phenomenon\" in the 1990s.[2] Born in London during World War II to Jewish refugees escaping the Holocaust, Springer was raised in Queens, New York City. He attended Northwestern University School of Law, qualified as a lawyer, and first became actively involved in politics working for the campaign of Robert Kennedy in 1968. A Cincinnati City Council member, Springer served as the 56th Mayor of Cincinnati from 1977 to 1978. He then worked as a local news anchor in Cincinnati where he won ten Regional Emmy Awards for commentary. From 2005 to 2006, Springer hosted Springer on the Radio, a liberal talk show on Cincinnati's WCKY-AM. He was the host of the television talent show America's Got Talent from 2007 to 2008, and of the television courtroom show Judge Jerry from 2019 to 2022. He also hosted The Jerry Springer Podcast from 2015 to 2022. One year after he retired from his television career, Springer died of pancreatic cancer on April 27, 2023 at the age of 79.[3][4] Gerald Norman Springer was born on February 13, 1944,[5] in the London Underground's Highgate station while the station was in use as a shelter from German bombing during World War II.[6][7] Springer spent his first years living on Chandos Road, East Finchley.[8] His parents, Margot (née Kallmann; a bank clerk) and Richard Springer (owner of a shoe shop), were Jewish refugees who escaped from Landsberg an der Warthe, Prussia (now Gorzów Wielkopolski, Poland).[9][10] His maternal grandmother, Marie Kallmann, was killed in the gas vans of Chełmno extermination camp in German-occupied Poland.[8] His paternal grandmother, Selma Springer (née Elkeles), died at the hospital in the Theresienstadt concentration camp in German-occupied Czechoslovakia.[8] Selma Springer's brother, Hermann Elkeles, was a renowned Berlin doctor who also died at Theresienstadt concentration camp.[11] In January 1949, when Springer was five,[12] his family emigrated to the United States, settling in the Kew Gardens neighborhood of Queens, a borough of New York City. He attended nearby Forest Hills High School. One of his earliest memories about current events was when he was 12 and watching the 1956 Democratic National Convention on television where he saw and was impressed by then-Senator John F. Kennedy.[13][14] Springer earned a Bachelor of Arts from Tulane University in 1965, majoring in political science.[15] He earned a Juris Doctor from Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law in 1968.[10][16] Springer worked as a political campaign adviser to Democrat Robert F. Kennedy in 1968.[16] Following Kennedy's assassination, he began practicing law at the Cincinnati law firm of Frost & Jacobs, now Frost Brown Todd.[17][18] Springer was a partner in the law firm of Grinker, Sudman & Springer from 1973 to 1985,[19] alongside former NBA agent Ronnie Grinker (d. 1997) and current Butler County, Ohio, magistrate Harry Sudman.[20] In 1970, Springer ran for the United States House of Representatives. He failed to unseat incumbent Republican Donald D. Clancy, but took 45% of the vote in a traditionally Republican district. He had previously spearheaded the effort to lower the voting age, including testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee in support of ratification of the 26th Amendment. Three days after announcing his candidacy, Springer, who was also an Army reservist at the time, was called to active duty and stationed at Fort Knox. He resumed his campaign after he was discharged.[21] Springer was elected to the Cincinnati City Council in 1971.[16] On April 29, 1974, Springer resigned from the council after admitting to soliciting a prostitute.[16][22] He ran for the office in 1975, winning by a landslide.[23][24] He was reelected in 1977 and 1979.[25] Springer was considered a \"gonzo\" type politician with stunts such as staying a night in jail and commandeering a bus after the city took over bus service.[26] In 1977, Springer was chosen by the Cincinnati City Council to serve for one year as mayor.[16] In 1981, Springer stepped down from his seat on the City Council to focus on running for governor of Ohio,[27] seeking the Democratic nomination in the 1982 Ohio gubernatorial election. Television commercials for Springer's campaign referenced his use of a check to pay a prostitute, saying that he was not afraid of the truth \"even if it hurts.\"[28][29] He failed to win the Democratic party's nomination—finishing a distant third behind former lieutenant governor Richard F. Celeste and Ohio Attorney General William J. Brown—and his political career was put on hold.[30] In the late 1980s, he played a major role in saving the historic Cincinnati Union Terminal.[30] Springer considered running for the United States Senate in 2000[31] and 2004,[32] but he backed down due to negative associations with the Jerry Springer talk show.[33] He also considered running in the 2018 Ohio gubernatorial election, but decided against it due to his age.[34] Even after his departure from politics, he was the largest contributor to the Hamilton County Democratic Party from 1993 to 2018.[26] In 2016, Springer voiced support for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 United States presidential election.[35] Springer was hired as a political reporter and commentator on Cincinnati's NBC affiliate, WLWT, which had, at the time, the lowest-rated news program. Later, having been named primary news anchor and managing editor, he needed a broadcast catchphrase in the model of other great newsmen. With the help of some others at WLWT, he created his signature line: \"Take care of yourself, and each other.\" Within two years he was Cincinnati's number-one news anchor, along with partner Norma Rashid. For five years, he was the most popular news anchor in the city,[16] garnering ten local Emmy Awards for his nightly commentaries, which were frequently satirized by Cincinnati radio personality Gary Burbank. Those commentaries would eventually become his \"Final Thought\" on Jerry Springer. Springer would remain commentator at WLWT until January 1993. He resided in Loveland, Ohio, during this time.[36] In 1997, the Chicago-based NBC-owned station WMAQ-TV hired Springer to serve as a news commentator. However, this proved to be unpopular among viewers, as it resulted in the resignation of long-time news anchors Ron Magers and Carol Marin due to Springer's talk show. After performing only two commentaries, Springer resigned as commentator.[37][38] Jerry Springer debuted on September 30, 1991.[39] It started as a politically oriented talk show, a longer version of Springer's commentaries. Guests on the show included Oliver North and Jesse Jackson, and topics included homelessness and gun politics.[40][41][42] In early 1994, Springer and his new producer, Richard Dominick, revamped the show's format to garner higher ratings. The show became more successful as it became targeted toward tabloidish sensationalism.[43] Guests were everyday people confronted on a television stage by a spouse or family member's adultery, homosexuality, transsexuality, prostitution, transvestism, hate group membership, or other controversial situations.[43] These confrontations were often promoted by scripted shouting or violence on stage. The show received substantial ratings and much attention.[43] By 1998, it was beating The Oprah Winfrey Show in many cities, and was reaching around 8 million viewers.[44] On July 10, 2002, the sons of guest Nancy Campbell-Panitz – who was murdered by her ex-husband after they appeared on a May 2000 episode with his girlfriend – filed suit in Sarasota County against Springer, his producers, and his distributor, claiming he created \"a mood that led to murder\".[45] Ultimately, the estate of Campbell-Panitz dropped all monetary claims against Jerry Springer and the show agreed to waive its claims for malicious prosecution against the personal representative of the estate of Campbell-Panitz and his counsel.[46] The British musical, Jerry Springer: The Opera was inspired by him and his talk show. For the New York City performances of the work at Carnegie Hall his character was portrayed by Harvey Keitel. The show won four Olivier awards for its run on London's West End.[47] In 2005, a UK version of the show aired on Britain's ITV network titled The Springer Show. A subdued and more tongue-in-cheek version of the US show, it beat its talk-show rival Trisha Goddard five to one in the ratings.[48] The VH1 \"celebreality\" series The Springer Hustle, which took a look at how Jerry Springer is produced, premiered in April 2007.[49] In April 2015, Springer debuted The Jerry Springer Podcast on his website, JerrySpringer.com.[50] He later partnered with Westwood One to stream the podcast.[51] It was also broadcast in the UK on Talkradio, on Sundays at midnight. Springer was the second American talk show host to travel to Cuba, after Conan O'Brien, for The Jerry Springer Podcast.[52] The podcast ended in 2022.[53] On July 26, 2018, Jerry Springer aired its final episode in syndication after 27 seasons before it began airing reruns on The CW on September 10, 2018.[54] Springer debuted a new courtroom show, Judge Jerry, on September 9, 2019.[55] The show gave him the opportunity to host a more \"grown-up\" program and to use his law school education.[56] On March 9, 2022, the series was canceled after three seasons with its final episode airing on August 22, 2022.[57] Springer hosted America's Got Talent on NBC for its second and third seasons, replacing Regis Philbin,[58] before leaving to concentrate on other projects.[59] From January 17, 2005, to December 5, 2006, Springer hosted Springer on the Radio, a liberal talk show on Cincinnati's WCKY-AM. He did the show from the Clear Channel studios in Kenwood, Ohio on Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays, and in Chicago (where his television show taped at the time) on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.[60] Air America Radio syndicated the program for most of the show's run. In 2007, Springer also cameoed in a handful of episodes of the George Lopez Show. He hosted Miss World in 2000[61] and 2001[62] and the Miss Universe 2008.[63] He was also the guest host for WWE Raw on February 15, 2010, at Wells Fargo Arena in Des Moines, Iowa. Springer also hosted The Price Is Right Live!. From 2010 to 2015, Springer hosted a dating game show called Baggage, which aired on GSN.[64] In July 2012, he hosted ''Price is Right Live!'' in Vancouver's Boulevard Casino.[65] He hosted the show at Jack Cincinnati Casino in 2018.[66] From January 2014, Springer hosted Investigation Discovery series Tabloid.[67] He hosted The Adam Carolla Show on April 25, 2014, where he sat in for Adam Carolla.[68] Springer guest hosted the 22nd-season premiere episode of WWE Raw on September 8, 2014, in an attempt to conduct an intervention with The Bella Twins.[69] Springer hosted the show Jerry Springer Presents WWE Too Hot For TV on the WWE Network in 2015.[70] After a few years of his US talk show being broadcast in the UK, ITV1 approached Springer, who temporarily co-hosted This Morning with Judy Finnigan in March 1999[71][72] and again in 2000. In summer 1999, ITV made 12 episodes of the UK-based version of the series, Jerry Springer UK, filmed at the same studios as his US show.[73] In September 1999, Springer made a pilot for a David Letterman-style talk show for ITV called Jerry Springer on Sunday. The show received good reviews and ratings and a further four episodes were commissioned to be broadcast in May 2000.[74] Five were broadcast during May and June 2000 under the name Springer.[75] The series was picked up by Channel 5 and renamed Late Night with Jerry Springer. Two series were made in 2000 and 2001 with 16 episodes.[76] While working for Channel 5 In 2001, he was the host of the UK version of Greed,[77] and a stand in host for The Wright Stuff. On April 16, 2006, Springer was the guest host for the opening show for the third series of The Friday Night Project for Channel 4 and guest hosted Have I Got News for You on December 12, 2008. In 2007, he signed on to host Nothing But the Truth, the UK version of Nada más que la verdad.[78] Springer covered the 2016 United States presidential election for ITV's Good Morning Britain.[79] In 2016, 2017 and 2018, he guest hosted three episodes of the BBC's The One Show with TV host Alex Jones.[80][81][82] Springer appeared in an episode of Married... with Children as the host of a talk show called The Masculine Feminist, in which he advocated for women getting the men's bowling night and eventually taking over at a bowling alley. Al Bundy and his friends tie Springer to a chair and take over his show with a stripper who jumps up and down for the crowd's delight.[83][84] Springer starred in the 1998 film Ringmaster as a talk show host largely based on himself, though named \"Jerry Farrelly\".[85] Ringmaster offers a behind-the-scenes look at would-be guests who apply to a Springer-like show. The same year, Springer also released an unrelated autobiography named Ringmaster. He quipped, \"I can only think of one title a year.\"[85] Four years later, Springer appeared in Brad Paisley's \"I'm Gonna Miss Her (The Fishin' Song)\" where the host is trying to stop a fight between men who like to fish and the wives who do not. Springer's section was titled \"My Husband Left Me for a Fish.\" The song hit number one of the country charts in July 2002 and won CMA Video of the Year three months later.[86] In 2004, he played the US president in The Defender, directed by Dolph Lundgren.[87] In June 2012, he appeared in Chicago at the Cambridge Theatre London as Billy Flynn for a short period of time, starring alongside Aoife Mulholland and Leigh Zimmerman.[88] He had a cameo appearance as himself in episode 2 of the Netflix show Happy!.[89] In 1996, he appeared on an episode of the ninth season of Roseanne and on The X-Files episode \"The Post-Modern Prometheus\". In 1998, he voiced a cartoon version of himself in the \"Starship Poopers\" segment of The Simpsons Halloween episode, Treehouse of Horror IX. That same year, he appeared as himself on an episode of The Wayans Bros.. In 1999, he appeared in the episode \"Mrs. Kraft\" of the third season of Sabrina the Teenage Witch with his talk show. That same year, he was in an episode of Space Ghost Coast to Coast. He made a cameo appearance in Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999) as himself during an episode of his show featuring Dr. Evil and his estranged son Scott Evil.[90] In 2009, Springer appeared as a guest on the British game show Countdown. He appeared on the Chris Moyles Show in April 2009[91][92] and was a guest on The Andrew Marr Show on May 31, 2009.[93] He was interviewed by satirist Chris Morris in his surreal radio series Blue Jam (Series 2, Episode 6). On January 23, 2004, Springer was featured in an episode of This American Life titled \"Leaving the Fold\".[1] In late 2006, Springer was a contestant on the third season of Dancing with the Stars, with his professional dance partner, Kym Johnson. He wanted to appear on the show so he could learn the waltz for the wedding of his daughter, Katie.[60][94] Springer and Johnson were eliminated in the seventh week of competition.[95] Springer appeared in an episode of BBC One's television series Who Do You Think You Are? on August 27, 2008.[96] In the episode he traveled to Poland, where he discovered that his maternal grandmother had been sent to Chełmno extermination camp by the Nazis and killed. His paternal grandmother died at Theresienstadt concentration camp in what is the Czech Republic. He wept openly when he learned of how they died.[97] Springer was a guest panelist on episodes of 8 Out of 10 Cats in 2014, Through the Keyhole in 2015,[98] and QI (\"Noodles\") in 2017.[99] In 2022, Springer competed in season eight of The Masked Singer as \"Beetle\". He was eliminated on \"Muppet Night\" alongside Kat Graham as \"Robo-Girl\".[100][101] In 1995, Springer recorded the album Dr. Talk for Fiddle Fish Records, which mostly consisted of country music covers.[102] On May 16, 2008, Springer delivered the Northwestern University School of Law commencement address.[103] Although many students had criticized the university's choice of speaker, he received a standing ovation from about half the audience and reviews of his speech were generally positive.[104] He later stated that his speech was about \"the ethical judgments we all have to make in whatever business we go\".[105] Springer married Micki Velton in 1973; though it is sometimes reported they divorced in 1994, a spokesperson said they were still married at the time of his death. The couple had a daughter, Katie, in 1976.[106] She was born without nasal passages, for which she required immediate surgery after birth, and is blind, as well as deaf in one ear. In a 2006 interview, Katie stated that her parents were always supportive despite her health complications and that they raised her as normally as possible.[107] In 2006, Springer donated $230,000 to Park School in Evanston, where his daughter worked as an assistant teacher, to help construct a high-tech facility called \"Katie's Corner\" for students with disabilities.[106] Springer died at his home in Evanston, Illinois, on April 27, 2023, at the age of 79.[108][109][110][111] A family spokesperson said that he had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer a few months prior to his death.[112] Steve Wilkos, former Jerry Springer show bodyguard, paid tribute to his colleague, saying \"Other than my father, Jerry was the most influential man in my life. Everything I have today I owe to Jerry. He was the smartest, most generous, kindest person I've ever known. My wife and I are devastated. We will miss him terribly.\" He was buried at Memorial Park Cemetery, Skokie, Illinois, U.S.[113] During and after his career, Springer and his program quickly became a cultural phenomenon, with commentators describing the show as central to the emergence of trash TV.[2] After his death, The Guardian said that Springer \"changed US television for better and worse\".[114] Despite his controversial career, he had a large fanbase from millennials, as his show gained popularity throughout their childhoods, leading the Los Angeles Times to dub him the \"millennials' babysitter\".[115] At the time of his death, Springer was credited for creating a new television format which encouraged conflict among its guests. USA Today cited him as an inspiration for other tabloid talk shows such as Maury and The Steve Wilkos Show. The Associated Press said that Springer's show was \"a US cultural pariah, synonymous with lurid drama\". In an obituary for Springer, The Irish Times said that Springer had changed the \"television medium\" through \"The Jerry Springer Formula\", which was \"straightforward, despicable and ingenious\".[116] The BBC noted that Springer had televised the \"fringes of [American] society to a global audience\" and called him an \"era-defining TV host\".[53]",

He was a savvy politician, pop cultural icon, and devout and loyal friend who was most proud when he spoke up for the marginalized and unrepresented. He connected equally with both the powerful and the man on the street. Strangers would open up to him and he loved nothing more than to give them a voice.

                "title": "Verizon settlement: Here's how much some customers are getting",
                "content": "Verizon settlement payments have started hitting customers' bank accounts as part of a $100 million resolution of a class-action lawsuit. Eligible customers had until April 15 to claim their share of the $100 million class-action settlement alleging customers who purchased postpaid wireless plans were charged administrative fees that the company had not advertised. Those affected were promised payouts of between $15 and $100. On Tuesday, however, customers reported receiving payments that were well below the settlement's minimum of $15. On social media sites including X, Verizon subscribers groused about measly sums they say the wireless provider had paid them. One customer posted a screenshot showing he'd been sent a prepaid Mastercard worth $2.37 as his Verizon Administrative settlement payment. Other social media users also reported receiving less than $15, and far less than the maximum payout of $100. Payouts were determined based on the following formula: Each legitimate claimant was entitled to $15 per account, plus an additional $1 for each month they received postpaid wireless or data services from Verizon and were charged an administrative fee. Payout amounts were capped at $100, according to the settlement terms. Verizon did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's inquiry about why some users' payouts totaled less than $15. Current and former Verizon customers who purchased postpaid wireless or data service plans and were charged an \"Administrative Charge\" and/or an \"Administrative and Telco Recovery charge\" between Jan. 1, 2016, and Nov. 8, 2023, were eligible for compensation, according to the class-action settlement agreement.

                "content": "Manage your account Did you get an email or an alert saying Verizon sent you a few bucks? Here's why. Last year, a proposed $100 million class action settlement with Verizon over the communication company's alleged practices of charging undisclosed administrative fees promised any customers who filed a claim a settlement payment of up to $100 each. Customers started reporting getting those payments Monday, and that \"up to\" part was doing a lot of heavy lifting. The settlement agreement said that each valid claim would receive a minimum of $15, plus $1 for every month of service the payee was a Verizon customer and paid the challenged administration fee. The reality fell a little short. Some customers got as much as $14.81 deposited to their PayPal or Venmo accounts. Some got $4.89. The person behind the Tech Life Channel on X, formerly Twitter, reported receiving a Mastercard gift card for $2.37. \"Got my pay out from the Verizon lawsuit !!! These lawsuits are a joke, waste of time,\" they said. While the company has not issued a statement about it, the settlement website said the final amount you receive depends on many factors, including how many claims were submitted. The base payment, after dividing the funds among the number of applicants, may have been significantly lower than the initial $15, with the additional dollar a year of service for some recipients bringing their payments up. Applicable taxes and any fees charged by the payment services each applicant specified when they filed may also affect the total. Another possible factor? Last year Reuters reported that the plaintiff's lawyers in the lawsuit were requesting $33 million in fees. According to the class action lawsuit, plaintiffs said that Verizon's \"administrative charge\" was not disclosed in the plan's advertised monthly fee and they were charged in a “deceptive and unfair manner.” Verizon has denied the claims, saying in a statement that the company “clearly identifies and describes its wireless consumer admin charge multiple times during the sales transaction, as well as in its marketing, contracts and billing.” In the settlement to resolve the lawsuit (actually a combination of four lawsuits), the company denied all wrongdoing and pans to continue to charge the administrative charge but agreed to pay $100 million to affected customers who submitted a claim. However, as part of this settlement, Verizon will amend its Customer Agreement to include revised Administrative Charge disclosures. USA TODAY explains that a class action lawsuit involves one or more people suing on behalf of themselves and others with similar claims. Once a class action lawsuit is approved, every member of the class is awarded, with the exception of anyone who opts out of the group. Current and former customers with wireless or data services that were charged administrative charges between Jan. 1, 2016, to Nov. 8, 2023, were eligible. Verizon sent out emails and letters to affected customers, who had to go to the settlement website and file a claim. But the deadline for that was April 15, 2024.

                "content": "Save up to 74% Subscribe to Kiplinger People are receiving payouts from the Verizon administrative settlement and are surprised at how small they are. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. This week, people started receiving payouts from a Verizon administrative fee settlement. This was the result of a $100 million class-action settlement over a monthly administrative charge. When information about the settlement first came out last year, we heard eligible customers would receive at least $15 and up to $100 from it, depending on how long you were a Verizon customer and how many people joined the settlement. And as the payouts started rolling in this week, it became clear that $100 check was more of a pipe-dream. \"Got my Verizon settlement check today. Thanks, lawyers,\" one person wrote on the \"mildly infuriating\" Reddit community, alongside a screenshot of a $7.85 payment. \"I got $9.03. Off to buy half a dozen eggs!\" another person responded.

Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail. Over here at Kiplinger, staff members who received payouts received them in the $7 to $11 range. So, what happened with the settlement, and what does it mean? As mentioned, the $100 million settlement suggested people would get at least $15, and more depending on how long they'd been customers. People were eligible if they were a Verizon post-paid subscriber charged a monthly administrative fee between January 2016 and November 2023. Eligible customers could submit a claim online through a settlement site and had to file a claim by April 15, 2024 — so, no, you can no longer submit a claim for this Verizon settlement. Why were the payments below $15? It's right there on the claim form (emphasis mine): \"Your Settlement Payment may be up to $100.00 for your Verizon account, but the final amount may be lower depending on how long you were a Verizon subscriber and how many Settlement Class Members file valid claims. [...] If the Settlement Fund is not sufficient to pay all the filed valid claims after deducting any Court-approved amounts for the cost of settlement administration, attorneys’ fees and costs, and incentive awards to the class representatives, then the payments made to the Settlement Class Members who filed valid claims will be decreased from the initial allocated amount on a pro-rata basis.\" In other words, if a ton of eligible people submitted claims and if things like attorney fees were high enough, payout amounts would be lower than $15. Clearly, some mixture of that is what ended up happening here. A key point to remember about class-action lawsuits is that the payout amount to each individual typically relates to how many eligible people submit a claim. So, the more customers a company has or the more widespread word gets about a settlement, the lower the payout amounts you can typically expect. This Verizon situation serves as a good reminder that class-action lawsuits won't make you rich. You're also probably not going to win the lottery, you shouldn't count on an inheritance for your retirement plan, and that one penny stock a friend suggested won't necessarily go to the moon if you put all your savings into it. Often, people look for tricks and loopholes that'll suddenly make them a millionaire. Unfortunately, however, for most people, making a fortune is much more boring. If you want to passively make money, you need patience, but there are tried-and-true ways. You can, for example, invest in the best ETFs to buy now or, if you're more risk-averse, put your money into one of the best high-yield savings accounts. Use good budgeting apps to track your spending and make sure you're making smart choices, like checking out Verizon deals before you upgrade your phone. Or how about this for surprise money: Open a 401(k), invest that in a low-cost index fund, and don't look at it for 15 years? But if you really believe settlement payouts are the way to go, I hear Apple just proposed a $95 million settlement. Good luck!

                "content": "Were you recently notified of an incoming payment from Verizon? If so, this may be why. In January 2024, Verizon agreed to pay $100 million to settle a class action lawsuit. The lawsuit, which was filed and overseen by the Superior Court of the State of New Jersey, alleged that U.S. customers who purchased post-paid wireless plans from the company were charged undisclosed administrative fees which Verizon \"implemented, charged, and increased\" in a \"deceptive and unfair manner.\" Customers who were charged and paid an administrative charge and/or an administrative and Telco Recovery Charge between Jan. 1, 2016, and Nov. 8, 2023, were eligible to file a claim in this settlement. Verizon denied any wrongdoing in this case, arguing that the lawsuit does not have any merit. The company stated that it will continue to charge the administrative charge and contended that it has the right to increase the charge, according to the settlement website. As a part of the settlement, the company will amend its customer agreement to include disclosures of the charge. The deadline to file a claim online or by mail was April 15, 2024. Now, as of Jan. 7, customers who filed claims have started to receive their settlement payouts, many of which seem to be much smaller than originally anticipated. Verizon customers who filed claims in this settlement have taken to social media with their reactions to the payouts. One X user described the payout as a \"tiny drop of money in the account.\" \"Got my pay out from the Verizon lawsuit ... These lawsuits are a joke ... Not even $15 bucks,\" wrote another user on X. Another X user said that they applied for the Verizon settlement \"a while ago\" and were just sent a deposit of $3. While Verizon has not released a statement regarding the payments, and did not immediately respond to a request for comment, the settlement website says that payment may be up to $100 but is dependent on how long you were a Verizon subscriber and how many settlement class members filed valid claims. The website states that there would be an \"initial minimum allocated amount\" of $15, plus $1 for every month your account received postpaid wireless or data services and was charged the aforementioned fees. However, it also states that if the settlement fund is not enough to pay all filed valid claims after deducting the costs of settlement administration, attorneys' fees, and incentive awards to class representatives, then the payments made will be decreased from the initial allocated amount on a \"pro-rata basis.\" If you filed a valid claim and have not yet received payment, keep an eye on your account. According to the settlement website, payments are expected to be distributed in early January 2025.",

                "content": "Ruby Franke (née Griffiths;[1] born January 18, 1982)[2][3][4] is an American convicted child abuser and former family vlogger who ran the now defunct YouTube channel called 8 Passengers. On August 30, 2023, Ruby Franke and Jodi Hildebrandt were arrested in Washington County, Utah, and charged with six counts of felony aggravated child abuse of two of Franke's children under Utah law, four counts to which she pled guilty. She was sentenced to serve between four and thirty years in prison on February 20, 2024.[5] In early 2015, Franke created a YouTube channel called 8 Passengers in which she documented her family life in Utah with her husband Kevin and their six children.[6][7][8] She originally posted five days a week at 6:00 a.m.[6] As of June 2020[update], the channel had around 2.5 million subscribers[9][10] and amassed 1 billion views.[11] Beginning in 2020, when one of the Franke children, a 16-year-old boy, said that he had been banned from his bedroom and made to sleep on a bean bag for seven months, viewers became concerned about his mother's disciplinary methods, which also included withholding food,[7][10] sending a child to a wilderness camp for troubled teens, threatening to behead a stuffed toy, and telling two of her children that Santa Claus would not be bringing them anything for Christmas that year because they were too \"numb\" to respond to other punishments.[8] A Change.org petition was launched reporting perceived child abuse and neglect.[7][8][10][12] The Franke parents posted in defense of the discipline, saying the incidents had been taken out of context.[9] The 8 Passengers YouTube channel declined in popularity in 2021.[7] In 2022, the Frankes separated, and Kevin moved out of the house. Ruby deleted the YouTube channel[13] and began working as a mental health coach at ConneXions, a company run by Jodi Hildebrandt, a counselor.[3][8][12] They launched a new video channel together called ConneXions in 2022,[14] and created a joint Instagram account called Moms of Truth,[14] offering parenting classes.[7] Neighbors and the Frankes' oldest daughter, a college student, called authorities to check on the latter's siblings after observing that their mother often left the children alone at home.[13] On August 30, 2023, Franke and Hildebrandt were arrested in Ivins, Utah, and two days later, both were charged with six counts of aggravated child abuse, a felony.[2][3][7][8][15][16] According to a statement from the Santa Clara-Ivins Public Safety Department, the arrests were triggered after Franke's twelve-year-old son, who appeared emaciated and had \"open wounds and duct tape around the extremities\", had escaped through a window of Hildebrandt's house and asked at a neighboring house for food and water.[2][3][7][15] Emergency services found Franke's ten-year-old daughter in the house, also malnourished; both children were taken to a hospital, where the boy was treated for severe malnourishment and \"deep lacerations from being tied up with rope\".[2][8] A search of the house found evidence \"consistent with the markings\" on the twelve-year-old, and the Utah Division of Child and Family Services took the boy and girl and two more of Franke's children into care.[2][3] Police later reported that according to the boy, cayenne pepper and honey had been used to dress his wounds.[13][17] Franke and Hildebrandt were held without bail.[18][19] Hildebrandt surrendered her license as a counselor pending resolution of the court case and a disciplinary investigation.[13][20] After her arrest, YouTube banned Franke from the platform, also deleting two channels that were linked to her.[21] On December 18, 2023, Franke pleaded guilty to four counts of aggravated child abuse. She later pleaded not guilty to two other counts.[22] The factual basis mentioned an incident of Franke forcing her son to work outdoors over several weeks with inadequate protection, resulting in severe sunburns, and claims that the children were possessed. Franke agreed to serve a prison sentence and to serve her respective sentences consecutively rather than concurrently. Franke was expected to testify against Hildebrandt in Hildebrandt's upcoming trial, but Hildebrandt separately pleaded guilty to four counts of felony aggravated child abuse on December 27, with two charges dropped as part of another plea deal.[23][24][25] On February 20, 2024, Franke received four consecutive sentences of between one and fifteen years' imprisonment, meaning she must serve a minimum term of four years. Although the maximum term that could be imposed for all sentences would be 60 years, the Utah Code dictates that the time served by a defendant upon whom consecutive sentences are imposed must not exceed 30 years, except in circumstances of life imprisonment or the death penalty. The exact term she will serve is to be decided by the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole.[5][26][27] The Frankes are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.[6][7] Their oldest daughter has stated that she has long disapproved of her mother's parenting strategies.[3][7] Franke has three sisters who are also parenting influencers;[3][6][7] they disassociated themselves from her actions in a joint statement[3][7][14] and later in individual videos.[28] In November 2023, Kevin Franke filed for divorce after the couple had been separated for more than a year.[29][30] Kevin later sued Hildebrandt over the child abuse of his children and the ruin of their family.[31][32] Franke's case was announced to be covered in the October 2024 Lifetime movie Mormon Mom Gone Wrong: The Ruby Franke Story[33] as part of its \"Ripped from the Headlines\" feature films starring Emilie Ullerup as Ruby Franke and Heather Locklear as Jodi Hildebrandt.[34] The movie was negatively perceived upon announcement by her children, with Franke's eldest daughter Shari stating that they were not contacted about the movie, none of the proceeds from the movie would go to the younger siblings in question, and that releasing the film would only hurt the victims more than they already were hurt beforehand.[35][36]",

                "title": "Who is Ruby Franke, the parenting influencer jailed for child abuse?",
                "content": "A woman who sprang to fame giving controversial parenting advice has been sentenced to at least four years in prison for child abuse. What happened to Ruby Franke and her family? On a late August morning in Utah, a 12-year-old boy covered in open wounds knocked at the door of a neighbour's house asking for food and water. He had escaped a nearby home moments before, by climbing out a window and running away with duct tape still on his ankles, police say. The boy was taken to hospital suffering from malnourishment and \"deep lacerations from being tied up with rope,\" according to the arrest record. In total, four children were taken into care and Franke, a parenting influencer and mother of six, was arrested. On Tuesday, 42-year-old Franke tearfully apologised in court as she learned her sentence, saying: \"I was so disoriented that I believed dark was light and right was wrong.\" She previously pleaded guilty to starving and abusing her children. She appeared along with her former business partner Jodi Hildebrandt, 54, who received the same sentence. Each woman was jailed for four terms of one to 15 years each. How did it come to this, for a woman who imparted parenting advice to two million YouTube subscribers? For some, Franke's arrest was no surprise, given the hundreds of videos over a number of years that had sparked criticism of her strict parenting style. She was behind the 8 Passengers YouTube channel which launched in 2015, during a boom in popularity for an array of family vlogging channels - a genre in their own right - that were making money on the platform. A year later, her videos had gained tens of thousands of views. She told local news at the time that filming herself with her family helped her \"live in the present and just enjoy the kids\". The videos she edited were a window into her life, showing a typical Mormon suburban family home-schooling, cooking, eating and chatting away together. But some moments raised eyebrows. In one video, she could be seen telling her sons they would \"lose the privilege to eat dinner\" if they continued play-fighting. In another, she said that her six-year-old \"needed\" to go hungry after forgetting to take her lunch to school. \"Hopefully nobody gives her food and nobody steps in and gives her a lunch, because then she's not going to learn,\" she told the camera. They had been trying to teach their children to \"live responsibly\" as \"masters of themselves\", her now-estranged husband Kevin Franke later said of the incident. Despite the criticism, the Frankes' authoritarian parenting approach continued and the audience kept building. Experts believe her success reflects a modern anxiety among parents that can lead them to seek out radical and harmful solutions. \"For parents who feel lost and desperate, particularly when it's dealing with problematic behaviour, extreme techniques become appealing, particularly if they see results,\" parenting psychologist Dr Maryhan Baker told the BBC. The success of family vlogging channels like Ruby Franke's can play on people's fears about their own parenting skills, child development specialist Dr Siggie Cohen explained. \"Parents are scared to make mistakes, and look for someone that seems to them to be fully in charge and in control.\" An off-the-cuff comment made by Franke's teenage son brought her parenting style to the attention of more mainstream audiences outside of the family vlogging sphere. In a 2020 video, he revealed that his bedroom had been taken away for seven months and he was instead sleeping on a beanbag, after playing pranks on his sibling. According to Franke in the same video, her son had shown he was unable to manage a bedroom and was offered alternatives such as a guest bed or inflatable mattress. The tone of their discussion was light, with the story drawing giggles from Franke and her other child. But many viewers were disturbed by the incident. A petition started by one demanding an investigation brought in thousands of signatures and child protective services were called. The outrage led to some YouTube and TikTok users making their own videos about the family, gaining millions of views. Older clips, such as those showing Franke describing withholding meals as a disciplinary measure, resurfaced and made headlines. In response to the controversy, Ruby and Kevin Franke told the news website Insider some accounts had \"malicious\" intentions and purposefully took the clips out of context. \"They were purely seeking to throw hate. That was their only objective. A reasonable person would not have seen that video and thought: 'She is a child abuser,'\" Ruby Franke told the site. Kevin Franke's lawyer later distanced him from the abuse allegations, saying he had no role in them. \"He is a good person,\" Randy Kester told Good Morning America, claiming that the Frankes had been living in separate homes for the past 13 months. Kevin Franke later filed for divorce from his wife and asked for the maximum sentence to be imposed on her - calling the abuse suffered by his children \"horrific and inhumane\". The controversy effectively marked the beginning of the end for the 8 Passengers YouTube channel. Daily videos were whittled down to two or three videos per week, and then none at all before it was deleted. But Franke remained active on social media, forming a new advice channel in June 2022 called ConneXions with Hildebrandt, her business partner and counsellor. The content they made together had a small fraction of the audience that 8 Passengers had in its prime. Franke once claimed that venture helped her make millions. She left that lucrative world, she said, to save her children. Recent posts on an Instagram account that the two share, called Moms of Truth, offer parenting guidance, urging followers to avoid \"coping strategies\" to distract from the \"pain and discomfort of Reality/Truth\". It is not clear what this reality or truth looks like, but the coping strategies they list include social media, exercise and socialising. On 30 August, the two women were arrested after Franke's malnourished son made his escape. Days later, they were charged with six counts of child abuse. \"Justice is being served,\" her eldest daughter wrote on Instagram, claiming she had been trying to raise concerns about her estranged family with police and child protection services for years. Franke's arrest \"needed to happen\", her sisters wrote in a joint statement, saying they had previously kept quiet for the sake of the children involved. Neither Franke nor Hildebrandt responded to a BBC request for comment after they were charged. The law firm representing Franke told the BBC that they would not make a statement. Franke's children are now safe, according to her sisters and estranged daughter, who said they have \"a long road ahead\" to recovery. The president-elect said he would not rule out the use of military force to seize control of the Panama Canal and Greenland. Mike Johns was on his way to the airport when the Waymo robotaxi began circling a parking lot non-stop Rossi was flown back to the US after being arrested in a Glasgow hospital, claiming to be an Irish orphan called Arthur Knight. The blaze has been fuelled by fierce winds that are expected to reach up to 100mph (160km/h). The comment follows Donald Trump's threat on Tuesday to use \"economic force\" to acquire its neighbour to the north. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

                "content": "A Utah mother whose harsh parenting advice made her a YouTube influencer has been sentenced to at least four years in prison for child abuse. Ruby Franke, 42, tearfully apologised in court as she learned her fate. She previously pleaded guilty to starving and abusing her children. She appeared along with her former business partner Jodi Hildebrandt, 54, who received an identical sentence. The judge sentenced them to serve four terms of one to 15 years each. The sentences will run consecutively and are the maximum for each count under Utah law. How much time each will ultimately serve will be determined by the state's parole board. Franke will have 30 days to appeal the decision. In court, Utah prosecutor Eric Clarke said that two of Franke's children, aged nine and 11 at the time, lived in a \"concentration camp-like setting\" and called her a significant threat to the community. \"The children were regularly denied food, water, beds to sleep in, and virtually all forms of entertainment,\" Mr Clarke said. In court, Franke was in tears following the sentence. She apologised to her children and said: \"I was so disoriented that I believed dark was light and right was wrong.\" \"I was led to believe that this world was an evil place, filled with cops who control, hospitals that injure, government agencies that brainwash, church leaders who lie and lust, husbands who refuse to protect and children who need abuse,\" she said. The two women were arrested in August 2023 after Franke's malnourished 12-year-old son climbed out of a window at Hildebrandt's house in Ivins, Utah. Police said the child then ran to a neighbour's house and asked for food and water. He had lacerations from being tied up with rope, according to police records. The arrests marked the end of a long and controversial YouTube career. Franke racked up more than two million subscribers to her channel 8 Passengers, which she started in 2015. It was a boom time for parenting vloggers, and she told a local news outlet that filming with her family helped her \"live in the present and just enjoy the kids\". Her videos showed a typical Mormon suburban family home-schooling, cooking, eating and chatting together. But fans started to become suspicious in 2020, when one of her sons mentioned that he had been forced to sleep on a bean bag for seven months. YouTube viewers combed through her archives and pointed out other disturbing and controversial methods used by Franke - such as withholding food, threatening to chop the head off a toy stuffed animal and \"cancelling\" Christmas as a punishment. A petition started by one demanding an investigation brought in thousands of signatures and Utah's child protection agency was called, although no legal action was taken at the time. Franke and her husband initially dismissed the criticism and said that some of their clips had been taken out of context. But the channel began to decline in popularity and was deleted in 2022, the same year Franke and her husband separated. Franke then began appearing in YouTube videos posted by Ms Hildebrandt - a counsellor and life coach - on her site, ConneXions Classroom. Away from the camera, however, Franke's children were being subjected to even harsher abuse. This included tying them up, beating and kicking them, neglecting to feed them and forcing them to work outdoors in the summer without sunscreen, resulting in serious sunburn, according to police records. In a plea agreement, Hildebrandt stated that she either tortured the children or was aware of the abuse and that she forced one of Franke's daughters to \"jump into a cactus multiple times\". Franke told her children that they were \"evil and possessed\" and needed to \"repent\". Through his lawyer, Franke's ex-husband Kevin Franke asked prior to the hearing for the maximum sentence to be imposed and called the abuse suffered by his children \"horrific and inhumane\". Immigration has long been a polarising issue in the West but Canada mostly avoided it - until now The president-elect said he would not rule out the use of military force to seize control of the Panama Canal and Greenland. Mike Johns was on his way to the airport when the Waymo robotaxi began circling a parking lot non-stop Rossi was flown back to the US after being arrested in a Glasgow hospital, claiming to be an Irish orphan called Arthur Knight.

                "title": "Who is Ruby Franke? Utah YouTube star arrested on suspicion of child abuse : NPR",
                "content": "By Emily Olson Ruby Franke, pictured here on her Instagram account, was arrested on suspicion of aggravated child abuse. @Moms_of_Truth/Instagram hide caption Ruby Franke, pictured here on her Instagram account, was arrested on suspicion of aggravated child abuse. Ruby Franke, a Utah YouTube star who has spent the last eight years dishing out parenting advice to millions of followers, was arrested Wednesday alongside her business partner, Jodi Hildebrandt, on suspicion of aggravated child abuse. Police said Franke's malnourished son escaped out a window with his arms and legs covered in duct tape, fleeing to a neighbor's house seeking food and water. For some of Franke's viewers, the news was no surprise. Her videos have long sparked criticism, controversy and claims that child abuse was unfolding, unabated, for digital viewers to enjoy. Here's a rundown of the situation. Franke is a 41-year-old Mormon mother of six from Ivins, Utah. Though active across several social media platform, she's best known for her once-popular YouTube channel, 8 Passengers. In over 1,000 videos since the channel's launch in 2015, Franke documents the sometimes-intimate, sometimes-mundane daily details of family life, gaining nearly 2.3 million subscribers in the process. Some of the most-watched videos show her children in their most vulnerable moments of suburban adolescence (learning to shave; trying on new clothes; facing reprimand). Franke, arms outstretched, selfie-style, toggles between speaking to the children directly and making eye contact with the camera, narrating her rationale for parenting decisions as they unfold in real time. Some of her lessons contain spiritual undertone or light references to traditional values. 8 Passengers was removed from YouTube earlier this year. NPR couldn't find a publicly stated explanation for the move, but the takedown coincided with a noticeable uptick in criticism. Even before the news of Franke's arrest, a string of expose-style videos and blog posts from other creators cataloged moment after moment of perceived toxic behavior. Some of this criticism takes aim at the style of the content altogether, saying Franke is one of hundreds of content creators who force children, too young to consent, to trade their privacy for her financial gain. It's a common refrain in today's influencer discourse. Earlier this month, Illinois became the first state to introduce a law mandating child influencers receive financial compensation for appearing in video content. But other concerns over 8 Passengers focused specifically on Franke and her strict parenting techniques — claims she openly abused her children in front of millions of eager viewers. In one video, posted in June 2020, Franke's then-15-year-old son said he'd slept on a beanbag chair for seven months after being banned from his shared bedroom for pranking his younger brother into believing he was being taken to Disneyland. In an interview with Insider, Franke defended the decision to revoke her son's \"bedroom privileges,\" but added that the beanbag comment had been taken out of context — the teen had been given a choice of sleeping on a blow-up or pull-out mattress but declined. In another video, Franke says she refused to bring food to her then-6-year-old after the child had forgotten her lunch at home. She defended that move, too, saying it was necessary to teach her daughter personal responsibility and that she was fed immediately upon returning home. Several other videos also show Franke threatening to take away meals as punishment. There are also videos of Franke threatening to cut the head off her child's teddy bear, taking away the children's Christmas presents and sending her oldest boy to a behavioral camp where youth spend a minimum of 49 days in the wilderness with little gear. A screenshot of a recent ConneXions video posted to Instagram, featuring tips for overcoming avoidance. @Moms_of_Truth/Instagram hide caption Around the same time Franke stopped posting on 8 Passengers, she started appearing in another video series — ConneXions Classroom. ConneXions bills itself as a mental health curriculum and counseling service structured around the principles of \"impeccable honesty, rigorous personal responsibility and vulnerable humility.\" The founder of the company, Jodi Hildebrandt, is a therapist who had her license suspended in 2012 after she disclosed a patient's \"porn addiction\" to his Mormon church leaders, The Salt Lake Tribune reported. Franke and Hildebrandt appeared together regularly in videos and podcasts, including as recently as Monday. The two share values-based lessons on topics like blame, control and denial, with notes on family life infused throughout. ConneXions' YouTube page was removed on Friday, following the news of the women's arrests. It's unclear if the video had been removed by the company or by YouTube. Around 10:50 a.m. on Wednesday, Franke's 12-year-old son climbed out of the window of Hildebrandt's house in the city of Ivins, according to an arrest affidavit signed by a Santa-Clara Ivins Public Safety officer. He ran to a neighbor's home, asking for food and water. The neighbor, noticing duct tape around the child's ankles and wrists, called the police. The responding officer said the child appeared severely malnourished and had sustained \"deep lacerations\" from being tied up with a rope. The boy was transported to a local hospital while police searched Hildebrandt's home. There, they discovered another child, Franke's 10-year-old daughter, who appeared to be malnourished. She was also taken to the hospital. In total, four of Franke's children were removed into the care of the Department of Child and Family Services, according to a press release from the Santa-Clara Ivins Public Safety Department. Franke and Hildebrandt were arrested on suspicion of two felony counts each of aggravated child abuse, though charges have not yet been filed through the local court system. Franke declined to speak with officers and requested an attorney, the affidavit said. The name of attorneys for either woman had not been publicly listed on court documents as of Friday. A lawyer reportedly representing Franke's husband did not respond to an NPR voicemail seeking comment by the time of publication. A call to the number listed for ConneXions went unreturned. A judge granted a detective's request that Franke be held without bail. Both women were still in custody as of Friday morning, according to the Washington County Sheriff's Office. Shari Franke, the family's eldest daughter at age 20, has not replied to NPR's request for comment, but has been posting about her mother's arrest on her Instagram stories. On Wednesday night, she shared a photo of officers at her childhood home and the caption \"finally,\" according to several news outlets that caught the initial story, which disappears by design after 24 hours. Shari later shared that she and her family were \"so glad justice is being served\" and had been \"trying to tell the police and CPS for years about this.\" She also called for help collecting links to \"questionable or concerning\" videos featuring her mother and shared a link to a Google doc filled with public contributions. Ruby Franke's three sisters, who are also family influencers, said in a joint post that the arrest \"needed to happen.\" \"For the last 3 years we have kept quiet on the subject of our sister Ruby Franke for the sake of her children. Behind the public scene we have done everything we could to try and make sure the kids were safe,\" they wrote. \"The kids are now safe, which is the number one priority.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

                "content": "Chronological history Vikings were seafaring people originally from Scandinavia (present-day Denmark, Norway, and Sweden),[3][4][5][6] who from the late 8th to the late 11th centuries raided, pirated, traded, and settled throughout parts of Europe.[7][8][9] They also voyaged as far as the Mediterranean, North Africa, the Middle East, Greenland, and Vinland (present-day Newfoundland in Canada, North America). In their countries of origin, and some of the countries they raided and settled in, this period is popularly known as the Viking Age, and the term \"Viking\" also commonly includes the inhabitants of the Scandinavian homelands as a whole. The Vikings had a profound impact on the early medieval history of northern and Eastern Europe, including the political and social development of England and parts of France, and established the embryo of Russia in Kyiv.[10] Expert sailors and navigators of their characteristic longships, Vikings established Norse settlements and governments in the British Isles, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Greenland, Normandy, and the Baltic coast, as well as along the Dnieper and Volga trade routes across Eastern Europe where they were also known as Varangians. The Normans, Norse-Gaels, Rus, Faroese, and Icelanders emerged from these Norse colonies. At one point, a group of Rus Vikings went so far south that, after briefly being bodyguards for the Byzantine emperor, they attacked the Byzantine city of Constantinople.[11] Vikings also voyaged to Iran[12][page needed] and Arabia.[13] They were the first Europeans to reach North America, briefly settling in Newfoundland (Vinland). While spreading Norse culture to foreign lands, they simultaneously brought home slaves, concubines, and foreign cultural influences to Scandinavia, influencing the genetic[14] and historical development of both. During the Viking Age, the Norse homelands were gradually consolidated from smaller kingdoms into three larger kingdoms: Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. The Vikings spoke Old Norse and made inscriptions in runes. For most of the period, they followed the Old Norse religion, but later became Christians. The Vikings had their own laws, art, and architecture. Most Vikings were also farmers, fishermen, craftsmen, and traders. Popular conceptions of the Vikings often strongly differ from the complex, advanced civilisation of the Norsemen that emerges from archaeology and historical sources. A romanticised picture of Vikings as noble savages began to emerge in the 18th century; this developed and became widely propagated during the 19th-century Viking revival.[15][16] Perceived views of the Vikings as violent, piratical heathens or as intrepid adventurers owe much to conflicting varieties of the modern Viking myth that had taken shape by the early 20th century. Current popular representations of the Vikings are typically based on cultural clichés and stereotypes, complicating modern appreciation of the Viking legacy. These representations are rarely accurate—for example, there is no evidence that they wore horned helmets, a costume element that first appeared in the 19th century. The etymology of the word Viking has been much debated by academics, with many origin theories being proposed.[18][19] One theory suggests that the word's origin is from the Old English wicing 'settlement' and the Old Frisian wizing, attested almost 300 years prior.[20] Another less popular theory is that víking came from the feminine vík 'creek', 'inlet', 'small bay'.[21] The Old Norse word víkingr does not appear in written sources until the 12th century, apart from a few runestones.[22] Another etymology that gained support in the early 21st century derives Viking from the same root as Old Norse vika 'sea mile', originally referring to the distance between two shifts of rowers, ultimately from the Proto-Germanic *wîkan 'to recede'.[23][24][25][26] This is found in the early Nordic verb *wikan 'to turn', similar to Old Icelandic víkja 'to move, to turn', with \"well-attested nautical usages\", according to Bernard Mees.[25] This theory is better attested linguistically, and the term most likely predates the use of the sail by the Germanic peoples of northwestern Europe.[26][25][27] In the Middle Ages, viking came to refer to Scandinavian pirates or raiders.[28][29][30] The earliest reference to wicing in English sources is from the Épinal-Erfurt glossary (c. 700), about 93 years before the first known attack by Viking raiders in England. The glossary lists the Latin translation for wicing as piraticum 'pirate'.[31][32] In Old English, the word wicing appears in the Anglo-Saxon poem Widsith, probably from the 9th century. The word was not regarded as a reference to nationality, with other terms such as Northmen and Dene 'Danes' being used for that. In Asser's Latin work The Life of King Alfred, the Danes are referred to as pagani 'pagans'; historian Janet Nelson states that pagani became \"the Vikings\" in standard translations of this work, even though there is \"clear evidence\" that it was used as a synonym, while Eric Christiansen avers that it is a mistranslation made at the insistence of the publisher.[33] The word wicing does not occur in any preserved Middle English texts. The word Viking was introduced into Modern English during the 18th-century Viking revival, at which point it acquired romanticised heroic overtones of \"barbarian warrior\" or noble savage.[34] During the 20th century, the meaning of the term was expanded to refer not only to seaborne raiders from Scandinavia and other places settled by them (like Iceland and the Faroe Islands), but also any member of the culture that produced the raiders during the period from the late 8th to the mid-11th centuries, or more loosely from about 700 to as late as about 1100. As an adjective, the word is used to refer to ideas, phenomena, or artefacts connected with those people and their cultural life, producing expressions like Viking age, Viking culture, Viking art, Viking religion, Viking ship and so on. The Viking Age in Scandinavian history is taken to have been the period from the earliest recorded raids by Norsemen in 793 until the Norman conquest of England in 1066.[35] Vikings used the Norwegian Sea and Baltic Sea for sea routes to the south. The Normans were descendants of those Vikings who had been given feudal overlordship of areas in northern France, namely the Duchy of Normandy, in the 10th century. In that respect, descendants of the Vikings continued to have an influence in northern Europe. Likewise, King Harold Godwinson, the last Anglo-Saxon king of England, had Danish ancestors. Two Vikings even ascended to the throne of England, with Sweyn Forkbeard claiming the English throne in 1013 until 1014 and his son Cnut the Great being king of England between 1016 and 1035.[36][37][38][39][40] Geographically, the Viking Age covered Scandinavian lands (modern Denmark, Norway and Sweden), as well as territories under North Germanic dominance, mainly the Danelaw, including Scandinavian York, the administrative centre of the remains of the Kingdom of Northumbria,[41] parts of Mercia, and East Anglia.[42] Viking navigators opened the road to new lands to the north, west and east, resulting in the foundation of independent settlements in the Shetland, Orkney, and Faroe Islands; Iceland; Greenland;[43] and L'Anse aux Meadows, a short-lived settlement in Newfoundland, circa 1000.[44] The Greenland settlement was established around 980, during the Medieval Warm Period, and its demise by the mid-15th century may have been partly due to climate change.[45] The semi-legendary Viking Rurik is said to have taken control of Novgorod in 862, while his kinsman Oleg captured Kiev in 882 and made it the capital of the Rus.[46] The Rurik dynasty would rule Russia until 1598.[47] As early as 839, when Swedish emissaries are first known to have visited Byzantium, Scandinavians served as mercenaries in the service of the Byzantine Empire.[48] In the late 10th century, a new unit of the imperial bodyguard formed. Traditionally containing large numbers of Scandinavians, it was known as the Varangian Guard. The word Varangian may have originated in Old Norse, but in Slavic and Greek it could refer either to Scandinavians or Franks. In these years, Swedish men left to enlist in the Byzantine Varangian Guard in such numbers that a medieval Swedish law, the Västgötalagen, from Västergötland declared no-one could inherit while staying in \"Greece\"—the then Scandinavian term for the Byzantine Empire—to stop the emigration,[49] especially as two other European courts simultaneously also recruited Scandinavians:[50] Kievan Rus' c. 980–1060 and London 1018–1066 (the Þingalið).[50] There is archaeological evidence that Vikings reached Baghdad, the centre of the Islamic Empire.[51] The Norse regularly plied the Volga with their trade goods: furs, tusks, seal fat for boat sealant, and slaves. Important trading ports during the period include Birka, Hedeby, Kaupang, Jorvik, Staraya Ladoga, Novgorod, and Kiev. Scandinavian Norsemen explored Europe by its seas and rivers for trade, raids, colonisation, and conquest. In this period, voyaging from their homelands in Denmark, Norway and Sweden the Norsemen settled in the present-day Faroe Islands, Iceland, Norse Greenland, Newfoundland, the Netherlands, Germany, Normandy, Italy, Scotland, England, Wales, Ireland, the Isle of Man, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,[52] Ukraine, Russia and Turkey, as well as initiating the consolidation that resulted in the formation of the present-day Scandinavian countries. In the Viking Age, the present-day nations of Norway, Sweden and Denmark did not exist, but the peoples who lived in what is now those countries were largely homogeneous and similar in culture and language, although somewhat distinct geographically. The names of Scandinavian kings are reliably known for only the later part of the Viking Age. After the end of the Viking Age, the separate kingdoms gradually acquired distinct identities as nations, which went hand-in-hand with their Christianisation. Thus, the end of the Viking Age for the Scandinavians also marks the start of their relatively brief Middle Ages.[citation needed] Slavic and Viking tribes were \"closely linked, fighting one another, intermixing and trading\".[53][54][55] In the Middle Ages, goods were transferred from Slavic areas to Scandinavia, and Denmark could be considered \"a melting pot of Slavic and Scandinavian elements\".[53] Leszek Gardeła, of the Department of Scandinavian Languages and Literatures at the University of Bonn, posits that the presence of Slavs in Scandinavia is \"more significant than previously thought\",[53] while Mats Roslund states that \"the Slavs and their interaction with Scandinavia have not been adequately investigated\".[56] A 10th-century grave of a warrior-woman in Denmark was long thought to belong to a Viking. However, new analyses suggest that the woman may have been a Slav from present-day Poland.[53] The first king of the Swedes, Eric, was married to Gunhild, of the Polish House of Piast.[57] Likewise, his son, Olof, fell in love with Edla, a Slavic woman, and took her as his frilla (concubine).[58] They had a son and a daughter: Emund the Old, King of Sweden, and Astrid, Queen of Norway. Cnut the Great, King of Denmark, England and Norway, was the son of a daughter of Mieszko I of Poland,[59] possibly the former Polish queen of Sweden, wife of Eric. Colonisation of Iceland by Norwegian Vikings began in the 9th century. The first source mentioning Iceland and Greenland is a papal letter from 1053. Twenty years later, they appear in the Gesta of Adam of Bremen. It was not until after 1130, when the islands had become Christianised, that accounts of the history of the islands were written from the point of view of the inhabitants in sagas and chronicles.[60] The Vikings explored the northern islands and coasts of the North Atlantic, ventured south to North Africa, and brought slaves from the Baltic coast and European Russia.[61][62] They raided and pillaged, traded, acted as mercenaries and settled colonies over a wide area.[63] Early Vikings probably returned home after their raids. Later in their history, they began to settle in other lands.[64] Vikings under Leif Erikson, heir to Erik the Red, reached North America and set up short-lived settlements in present-day L'Anse aux Meadows, Newfoundland, Canada. This expansion occurred during the Medieval Warm Period.[65] Viking expansion into continental Europe was limited. Their realm was bordered by powerful tribes to the south. Early on, it was the Saxons who occupied Old Saxony, located in what is now Northern Germany. The Saxons were a fierce and powerful people and were often in conflict with the Vikings. To counter the Saxon aggression and solidify their own presence, the Danes constructed the huge defence fortification of Danevirke in and around Hedeby.[66] The Vikings witnessed the violent subduing of the Saxons by Charlemagne, in the thirty-year Saxon Wars of 772–804. The Saxon defeat resulted in their forced christening and the absorption of Old Saxony into the Carolingian Empire. Fear of the Franks led the Vikings to further expand Danevirke,[66] and the defence constructions remained in use throughout the Viking Age and even up until 1864.[67] The southern coast of the Baltic Sea was ruled by the Obotrites, a federation of Slavic tribes loyal to the Carolingians and later the Frankish empire. The Vikings—led by King Gudfred—destroyed the Obotrite city of Reric on the southern Baltic coast in 808 AD and transferred the merchants and traders to Hedeby.[68] This secured Viking supremacy in the Baltic Sea, which continued throughout the Viking Age. Because of the expansion of the Vikings across Europe, a comparison of DNA and archeology undertaken by scientists at the University of Cambridge and University of Copenhagen suggested that the term \"Viking\" may have evolved to become \"a job description, not a matter of heredity\", at least in some Viking bands.[69] The motives driving the Viking expansion are a topic of much debate. The concept that Vikings may have originally started sailing and raiding due to a need to seek out women from foreign lands was expressed in the 11th century by historian Dudo of Saint-Quentin in his semi-imaginary History of The Normans.[70] [71][72] As observed by Adam of Bremen, rich and powerful Viking men tended to have many wives and concubines;[73] and these polygynous relationships may have led to a shortage of women available to the Viking male. Consequently, the average Viking man may have felt compelled to seek wealth and power to have the means to acquire suitable women.[74] Several centuries after Dudo's observations, scholars revived this idea, and over time it became a cliché among scholars of the Viking Age.[75] Viking men would often buy or capture women and make them into their wives or concubines;[76][77] such polygynous marriages increase male-male competition in society because they create a pool of unmarried men who are willing to engage in risky status-elevating and sex-seeking behaviors.[78][79] The Annals of Ulster states that in 821 the Vikings plundered an Irish village and \"carried off a great number of women into captivity\".[80] One common theory posits that Charlemagne \"used force and terror to Christianise all pagans\", leading to baptism, conversion or execution, and as a result, Vikings and other pagans resisted and wanted revenge.[81][82][83][84][85] Professor Rudolf Simek states that \"it is not a coincidence if the early Viking activity occurred during the reign of Charlemagne\".[81][86] The ascendance of Christianity in Scandinavia led to serious conflict, dividing Norway for almost a century. However, this time period did not commence until the 10th century. Norway was never subject to aggression by Charlemagne and the period of strife was due to successive Norwegian kings embracing Christianity after encountering it overseas.[87] Another explanation is that the Vikings exploited a moment of weakness in the surrounding regions. Contrary to Simek's assertion, Viking raids occurred sporadically long before the reign of Charlemagne; but exploded in frequency and size after his death, when his empire fragmented into multiple much weaker entities.[88] England suffered from internal divisions and was a relatively easy prey given the proximity of many towns to the sea or to navigable rivers. Lack of organised naval opposition throughout Western Europe allowed Viking ships to travel freely, raiding or trading as opportunity permitted. The decline in the profitability of old trade routes could also have played a role. Trade between Western Europe and the rest of Eurasia suffered a severe blow when the Western Roman Empire fell in the 5th century.[89] The expansion of Islam in the 7th century had also affected trade with Western Europe.[90] Raids in Europe, including raids and settlements from Scandinavia, were not unprecedented and had occurred long before the Vikings arrived. The Jutes invaded the British Isles three centuries earlier, from Jutland during the Age of Migrations, before the Danes settled there. The Saxons and the Angles did the same, embarking from mainland Europe. The Viking raids were, however, the first to be documented by eyewitnesses, and they were much larger in scale and frequency than in previous times.[88] Vikings themselves were expanding; although their motives are unclear, historians believe that scarce resources or a lack of mating opportunities were a factor.[91] The slave trade was an important part of the Viking economy, with most slaves destined to Scandinavia, although many others were shipped east where they could be sold for large profits.[92] The \"Highway of Slaves\" was a term for a route that the Vikings found to have a direct pathway from Scandinavia to Constantinople and Baghdad while traveling on the Baltic Sea. With the advancements of their ships during the 9th century, the Vikings were able to sail to Kievan Rus and some northern parts of Europe.[93] Jomsborg was a semi-legendary Viking stronghold at the southern coast of the Baltic Sea (medieval Wendland, modern Pomerania), that existed between the 960s and 1043. Its inhabitants were known as Jomsvikings. Jomsborg's exact location, or its existence, has not yet been established, though it is often maintained that Jomsborg was somewhere on the islands of the Oder estuary.[94] While the Vikings were active beyond their Scandinavian homelands, Scandinavia was itself experiencing new influences and undergoing a variety of cultural changes.[95] By the late 11th century, royal dynasties were legitimised by the Catholic Church (which had had little influence in Scandinavia 300 years earlier) which were asserting their power with increasing authority and ambition, with the three kingdoms of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden taking shape. Towns appeared that functioned as secular and ecclesiastical administrative centres and market sites, and monetary economies began to emerge based on English and German models.[96] By this time the influx of Islamic silver from the East had been absent for more than a century, and the flow of English silver had come to an end in the mid-11th century.[97] Christianity had taken root in Denmark and Norway with the establishment of dioceses in the 11th century, and the new religion was beginning to organise and assert itself more effectively in Sweden. Foreign churchmen and native elites were energetic in furthering the interests of Christianity, which was now no longer operating only on a missionary footing, and old ideologies and lifestyles were transforming. By 1103, the first archbishopric was founded in Scandinavia, at Lund, Scania, then part of Denmark. The assimilation of the nascent Scandinavian kingdoms into the cultural mainstream of European Christendom altered the aspirations of Scandinavian rulers and of Scandinavians able to travel overseas, and changed their relations with their neighbours. One of the primary sources of profit for the Vikings had been slave-taking from other European peoples. The medieval Church held that Christians should not own fellow Christians as slaves, so chattel slavery diminished as a practice throughout northern Europe. This took much of the economic incentive out of raiding, though sporadic slaving activity continued into the 11th century. Scandinavian predation in Christian lands around the North and Irish Seas diminished markedly. The kings of Norway continued to assert power in parts of northern Britain and Ireland, and raids continued into the 12th century, but the military ambitions of Scandinavian rulers were now directed toward new paths. In 1107, Sigurd I of Norway sailed for the eastern Mediterranean with Norwegian crusaders to fight for the newly established Kingdom of Jerusalem; the kings of Denmark and Sweden participated actively in the Baltic Crusades of the 12th and 13th centuries.[98] A variety of sources illuminate the culture, activities, and beliefs of the Vikings. Although they were generally a non-literate culture that produced no literary legacy, they had an alphabet and described themselves and their world on runestones. Most contemporary literary and written sources on the Vikings come from other cultures that were in contact with them.[99] Since the mid-20th century, archaeological findings have built a more complete and balanced picture of the lives of the Vikings.[100][101] The archaeological record is particularly rich and varied, providing knowledge of their rural and urban settlement, crafts and production, ships and military equipment, trading networks, as well as their pagan and Christian religious artefacts and practices. The most important primary sources on the Vikings are contemporary texts from Scandinavia and regions where the Vikings were active.[102] Writing in Latin letters was introduced to Scandinavia with Christianity, so there are few native documentary sources from Scandinavia before the late 11th and early 12th centuries.[103] The Scandinavians did write inscriptions in runes, but these were usually very short and formulaic. Most contemporary documentary sources consist of texts written in Christian and Islamic communities outside Scandinavia, often by authors who had been negatively affected by Viking activity. Later writings on the Vikings and the Viking Age can also be important for understanding them and their culture, although they need to be treated cautiously. After the consolidation of the church and the assimilation of Scandinavia and its colonies into mainstream medieval Christian culture in the 11th and 12th centuries, native written sources began to appear in Latin and Old Norse. In the Viking colony of Iceland, extraordinary vernacular literature blossomed in the 12th through 14th centuries, and many traditions connected with the Viking Age were written down for the first time in the Icelandic sagas. A literal interpretation of these medieval prose narratives about the Vikings and the Scandinavian past is doubtful, but many specific elements remain worthy of consideration, such as the great quantity of skaldic poetry attributed to court poets of the 10th and 11th centuries, the exposed family trees, the self-images, and the ethical values that are contained in these literary writings. Indirectly, the Vikings have also left a window open onto their language, culture and activities, through many Old Norse place names and words found in their former sphere of influence. Some of these place names and words are still in direct use today, almost unchanged, and shed light on where they settled and what specific places meant to them. Examples include place names like Egilsay (from Eigils ey meaning Eigil's Island), Ormskirk (from Ormr kirkja meaning Orms Church or Church of the Worm), Meols (from merl meaning Sand Dunes), Snaefell (Snow Fell), Ravenscar (Ravens Rock), Vinland (Land of Wine or Land of Winberry), Kaupanger (Market Harbour), Tórshavn (Thor's Harbour), and the religious centre of Odense, meaning a place where Odin was worshipped. Viking influence is also evident in concepts like the present-day parliamentary body of the Tynwald on the Isle of Man. Many common words in everyday English language stem from the Old Norse of the Vikings and give an opportunity to understand their interactions with the people and cultures of the British Isles.[104] In the Northern Isles of Shetland and Orkney, Old Norse completely replaced the local languages and over time evolved into the now extinct Norn language. Some modern words and names only emerge and contribute to our understanding after a more intense research of linguistic sources from medieval or later records, such as York (Horse Bay), Swansea (Sveinn's Isle) or some of the place names in Normandy like Tocqueville (Toki's farm).[105] Linguistic and etymological studies continue to provide a vital source of information on the Viking culture, their social structure and history and how they interacted with the people and cultures they met, traded, attacked or lived with in overseas settlements.[106][107] A lot of Old Norse connections are evident in the modern-day languages of Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Faroese and Icelandic.[108] Old Norse did not exert any great influence on the Slavic languages in the Viking settlements of Eastern Europe. It has been speculated that the reason for this was the great differences between the two languages, combined with the Rus Vikings' more peaceful businesses in these areas, and the fact that they were outnumbered. The Norse named some of the rapids on the Dnieper, but this can hardly be seen from modern names.[109][110] The Norse of the Viking Age could read and write and used a non-standardised alphabet, called runor, built upon sound values. While there are few remains of runic writing on paper from the Viking era, thousands of stones with runic inscriptions have been found where Vikings lived. They are usually in memory of the dead, though not necessarily placed at graves. The use of runor survived into the 15th century, used in parallel with the Latin alphabet. The runestones are unevenly distributed in Scandinavia: Denmark has 250 runestones, Norway has 50 while Iceland has none.[111] Sweden has as many as between 1,700[111] and 2,500[112] depending on the definition. The Swedish district of Uppland has the highest concentration with as many as 1,196 inscriptions in stone, whereas Södermanland is second with 391.[113] The majority of runic inscriptions from the Viking period are found in Sweden. Many runestones in Scandinavia record the names of participants in Viking expeditions, such as the Kjula runestone that tells of extensive warfare in Western Europe and the Turinge Runestone, which tells of a war band in Eastern Europe. Swedish runestones are mostly from the 11th century and often contain rich inscriptions, such as the Färentuna, Hillersjö, Snottsta and Vreta stones, which provide extensive detail on the life of one family, Gerlög and Inga.[114] Other runestones mention men who died on Viking expeditions. Among them are the England runestones (Swedish: Englandsstenarna), which is a group of about 30 runestones in Sweden which refer to Viking Age voyages to England. They constitute one of the largest groups of runestones that mention voyages to other countries, and they are comparable in number only to the approximately 30 Greece Runestones[115] and the 26 Ingvar Runestones, the latter referring to a Viking expedition to the Middle East.[116] They were engraved in Old Norse with the Younger Futhark.[117] The Jelling stones date from between 960 and 985. The older, smaller stone was raised by King Gorm the Old, the last pagan king of Denmark, as a memorial honouring Queen Thyre.[118] The larger stone was raised by his son, Harald Bluetooth, to celebrate the conquest of Denmark and Norway and the conversion of the Danes to Christianity. It has three sides: one with an animal image; one with an image of the crucified Jesus Christ; and a third bearing the following inscription: King Haraldr ordered this monument made in memory of Gormr, his father, and in memory of Thyrvé, his mother; that Haraldr who won for himself all of Denmark and Norway and made the Danes Christian.[119] Runic inscriptions are also found outside Scandinavia, in places as far as Greenland and Istanbul.[120] Runestones attest to voyages to locations such as Bath,[121] Greece (how the Vikings referred to the Byzantium territories generally),[122] Khwaresm,[123] Jerusalem,[124] Italy (as Langobardland),[125] Serkland (i.e. the Muslim world),[126][127] England[128] (including London),[129] and various places in Eastern Europe. Viking Age inscriptions have also been discovered on the Manx runestones on the Isle of Man. Not all runestones are from the Viking Age, such as the Kingittorsuaq Runestone in Greenland, which dates to the early 14th century.[120] The last known people to use the Runic alphabet were an isolated group of people known as the Elfdalians, that lived in the locality of Älvdalen in the Swedish province of Dalarna. They spoke the language of Elfdalian, the language unique to Älvdalen. The Elfdalian language differentiates itself from the other Scandinavian languages as it evolved much closer to Old Norse. The people of Älvdalen stopped using runes as late as the 1920s. Usage of runes therefore survived longer in Älvdalen than anywhere else in the world.[130] The last known record of the Elfdalian Runes is from 1929; they are a variant of the Dalecarlian runes, runic inscriptions that were also found in Dalarna. Traditionally regarded as a Swedish dialect,[131] but by several criteria closer related to West Scandinavian dialects,[132] Elfdalian is a separate language by the standard of mutual intelligibility.[133][134][135] Although there is no mutual intelligibility, due to schools and public administration in Älvdalen being conducted in Swedish, native speakers are bilingual and speak Swedish at a native level. Residents in the area who speak only Swedish as their sole native language, neither speaking nor understanding Elfdalian, are also common. Älvdalen can be said to have had its own alphabet during the 17th and 18th century. Today there are about 2,000–3,000 native speakers of Elfdalian. There are numerous burial sites associated with Vikings throughout Europe and their sphere of influence—in Scandinavia, the British Isles, Ireland, Greenland, Iceland, Faeroe Islands, Germany, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, Russia, etc. The burial practices of the Vikings were quite varied, from dug graves in the ground, to tumuli, sometimes including so-called ship burials. According to written sources, most of the funerals took place at sea. Funerals involved either burial or cremation, depending on local customs. In the area that is now Sweden, cremations were predominant; in Denmark burial was more common; and in Norway both were common.[136] Viking barrows are one of the primary sources of evidence for circumstances in the Viking Age.[137] The items buried with the dead give some indication as to what was considered important to possess in the afterlife.[138] It is unknown what mortuary services were given to dead children by the Vikings.[139] Some of the most important burial sites for understanding the Vikings include: There have been several archaeological finds of Viking ships of all sizes, providing knowledge of the craftsmanship that went into building them. There were many types of Viking ships, built for various uses; the best-known type is probably the longship.[146] Longships were intended for warfare and exploration, designed for speed and agility, and were equipped with oars to complement the sail, making navigation possible independently of the wind. The longship had a long, narrow hull and shallow draught to facilitate landings and troop deployments in shallow water. Longships were used extensively by the Leidang, the Scandinavian defence fleets. The longship allowed the Norse to go Viking, which might explain why this type of ship has become almost synonymous with the concept of Vikings.[147][148] The Vikings built many unique types of watercraft, often used for more peaceful tasks. The knarr was a dedicated merchant vessel designed to carry cargo in bulk. It had a broader hull, a deeper draught, and a small number of oars (used primarily to manoeuvre in harbours and similar situations). One Viking innovation was the 'beitass', a spar mounted to the sail that allowed their ships to sail effectively against the wind.[149] It was common for seafaring Viking ships to tow or carry a smaller boat to transfer crew and cargo from the ship to shore. Ships were an integral part of Viking culture. They facilitated everyday transportation across seas and waterways, exploration of new lands, raids, conquests, and trade with neighbouring cultures. They also held a major religious importance. People with high status were sometimes buried in a ship along with animal sacrifices, weapons, provisions and other items, as evidenced by the buried vessels at Gokstad and Oseberg in Norway[150] and the excavated ship burial at Ladby in Denmark. Ship burials were also practised by Vikings overseas, as evidenced by the excavations of the Salme ships on the Estonian island of Saaremaa.[151] Well-preserved remains of five Viking ships were excavated from Roskilde Fjord in the late 1960s, representing both the longship and the knarr. The ships were scuttled there in the 11th century to block a navigation channel and thus protect Roskilde, then the Danish capital, from a seaborne assault. The remains of these ships are on display at the Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde. In 2019, archaeologists uncovered two Viking boat graves in Gamla Uppsala. They also discovered that one of the boats still holds the remains of a man, a dog, and a horse, along with other items.[152] This has shed light on the death rituals of Viking communities in the region. Viking society was divided into the three socio-economic classes: thralls, karls and jarls. This is described vividly in the Eddic poem of Rígsþula, which also explains that it was the god Ríg—father of mankind also known as Heimdallr—who created the three classes. Archaeology has confirmed this social structure.[153] In daily life, there were many intermediate positions in the overall social structure and it appears that there was some social mobility between them. These details are unclear, but titles and positions like hauldr, thegn, and landmand, show mobility between the karls and the jarls. Other social structures included the communities of félag in both the civil and the military spheres, to which its members (called félagi) were obliged. A félag could be centred around certain trades, a common ownership of a sea vessel or a military obligation under a specific leader. Members of the latter were referred to as drenge, one of the words for warrior. There were also official communities within towns and villages, the overall defence, religion, the legal system and the Things. Like elsewhere in medieval Europe, most women in Viking society were subordinate to their husbands and fathers and had little political power.[159][160] However, written sources portray free Viking women as having independence and rights. Viking women generally appear to have had more freedom than women elsewhere,[160] as illustrated in the Icelandic Grágás and the Norwegian Frostating laws and Gulating laws.[161] Most free Viking women were housewives, and a woman's standing in society was linked to that of her husband.[160] Marriage gave a woman a degree of economic security and social standing encapsulated in the title húsfreyja (lady of the house). Norse laws assert the housewife's authority over the 'indoor household'. She had the important roles of managing the farm's resources, conducting business, as well as child-rearing, although some of this would be shared with her husband.[162] After the age of 20, an unmarried woman, referred to as maer and mey, reached legal majority and had the right to decide her place of residence and was regarded as her own person before the law.[161] An exception to her independence was the right to choose a husband, as marriages were normally arranged by the family.[163] The groom would pay a bride-price (mundr) to the bride's family, and the bride brought assets into the marriage, as a dowry.[162] A married woman could divorce her husband and remarry.[160][164] Concubinage was also part of Viking society, whereby a woman could live with a man and have children with him without marrying; such a woman was called a frilla.[164] Usually she would be the mistress of a wealthy and powerful man who also had a wife.[159] The wife had authority over the mistresses if they lived in her household.[160] Through her relationship to a man of higher social standing, a concubine and her family could advance socially; although her position was less secure than that of a wife.[159] There was little distinction made between children born inside or outside marriage: both had the right to inherit property from their parents, and there were no \"legitimate\" or \"illegitimate\" children.[164] However, children born in wedlock had more inheritance rights than those born out of wedlock.[162] A woman had the right to inherit part of her husband's property upon his death,[162] and widows enjoyed the same independent status as unmarried women.[164] The paternal aunt, paternal niece and paternal granddaughter, referred to as odalkvinna, all had the right to inherit property from a deceased man.[161] A woman with no husband, sons or male relatives could inherit not only property but also the position as head of the family when her father or brother died. Such a woman was referred to as Baugrygr, and she exercised all the rights afforded to the head of a family clan, until she married, by which her rights were transferred to her new husband.[161] Women had religious authority and were active as priestesses (gydja) and oracles (sejdkvinna).[165] They were active within art as poets (skalder)[165] and rune masters, and as merchants and medicine women.[165] There may also have been female entrepreneurs, who worked in textile production.[160] Women may also have been active within military offices: the tales about shieldmaidens are unconfirmed, but some archaeological finds such as the Birka female Viking warrior may indicate that at least some women in military authority existed.[166] These liberties of the Viking women gradually disappeared after the introduction of Christianity,[167] and from the late 13th century, they are no longer mentioned.[161] Examination of Viking Age burials suggests that women lived longer, and nearly all well past the age of 35, as compared to earlier times. Female graves from before the Viking Age in Scandinavia hold a proportionally large number of remains from women aged 20 to 35, presumably due to complications of childbirth.[168] Examination of skeletal remains also allows the relative health and nutritional status of boys and girls in the past to be reconstructed, using anthropometric techniques. Burials from Scandinavia and other European countries suggest that, in comparison with other societies at the time, female equality was remarkably high in rural Scandinavia. Females in the rural periphery of Nordic countries during the Viking period and the later Middle Ages had relatively high status, resulting in substantial nutritional and health resources being allocated to girls, enabling them to grow stronger and healthier.[169] Scandinavian Vikings were similar in appearance to modern Scandinavians: \"their skin was fair and the hair color varied between blond, dark and reddish\". Genetic studies suggest that people were mostly blond in what is now eastern Sweden, while red hair was mostly found in western Scandinavia.[170] Most Viking men had shoulder-length hair and beards, and slaves (thralls) were usually the only men with short hair.[171] The length varied according to personal preference and occupation. Men involved in warfare, for example, may have had slightly shorter hair and beards for practical reasons. Men in some regions bleached their hair a golden saffron colour.[171] Females also had long hair, with girls often wearing it loose or braided, and married women often wearing it in a bun.[171] The average height is estimated to have been 1.70 m (5 ft 7 in) for men and 1.55 m (5 ft 1 in) for women.[170] The three classes were easily recognisable by their appearance. Men and women of the Jarls were well groomed with neat hairstyles and expressed their wealth and status by wearing expensive clothes (often silk) and well-crafted jewellery like brooches, belt buckles, necklaces and arm rings. Almost all of the jewellery was crafted in specific designs unique to the Norse (see Viking art). Finger rings were seldom used and earrings were not used at all, as they were seen as a Slavic phenomenon. Most karls expressed similar tastes and hygiene, but in a more relaxed and inexpensive way.[153][172] Archaeological finds from Scandinavia and Viking settlements in the British Isles support the idea of the well-groomed and hygienic Viking. Burial with grave goods was a common practice in the Scandinavian world, through the Viking Age and well past the Christianisation of the Norse peoples.[173] Within these burial sites and homesteads, combs, often made from antler, are a common find.[174][175] The manufacturing of such antler combs was common, as at the Viking settlement at Dublin hundreds of examples of combs from the tenth-century have survived, suggesting that grooming was a common practice. The manufacture of such combs was also widespread throughout the Viking world, as examples of similar combs have been found at Viking settlements in Ireland,[176] England,[177] and Scotland.[178] The combs share a common visual appearance as well, with the extant examples often decorated with linear, interlacing, and geometric motifs, or other forms of ornamentation depending on the comb's period and type, but stylistically similar to Viking Age art.[179] All levels of Viking age society appear to have groomed their hair, as hair combs have been found in common graves as well as in aristocratic ones.[180] The sagas tell about the diet and cuisine of the Vikings,[181] but first-hand evidence, like cesspits, kitchen middens and garbage dumps have proved to be of great value and importance. Undigested remains of plants from cesspits at Coppergate in York have provided much information in this respect. Overall, archaeo-botanical investigations have been undertaken increasingly in recent decades, as a collaboration between archaeologists and palaeoethno-botanists. This new approach sheds light on the agricultural and horticultural practices of the Vikings and their cuisine.[182] The combined information from various sources suggests a diverse cuisine and ingredients. Meat products of all kinds, such as cured, smoked and whey-preserved meat,[183] sausages, and boiled or fried fresh meat cuts, were prepared and consumed.[184] There were plenty of seafood, bread, porridges, dairy products, vegetables, fruits, berries and nuts. Alcoholic drinks like beer, mead, bjórr (a strong fruit wine) and, for the rich, imported wine, were served.[185][186] Certain livestock were typical and unique to the Vikings, including the Icelandic horse, Icelandic cattle, a plethora of sheep breeds,[187] the Danish hen and the Danish goose.[188][189] The Vikings in York mostly ate beef, mutton, and pork with small amounts of horse meat. Most of the beef and horse leg bones were found split lengthways, to extract the marrow. The mutton and swine were cut into leg and shoulder joints and chops. The frequent remains of pig skull and foot bones found on house floors indicate that brawn and trotters were also popular. Hens were kept for both their meat and eggs, and the bones of game birds such as black grouse, golden plover, wild ducks, and geese have also been found.[190] Seafood was important, in some places even more so than meat. Whales and walrus were hunted for food in Norway and the northwestern parts of the North Atlantic region, and seals were hunted nearly everywhere. Oysters, mussels and shrimp were eaten in large quantities and cod and salmon were popular fish. In the southern regions, herring was also important.[191][192][193] Milk and buttermilk were popular, both as cooking ingredients and drinks, but were not always available, even at farms.[194] Milk came from cows, goats and sheep, with priorities varying from location to location,[195] and fermented milk products like skyr or surmjölk were produced as well as butter and cheese.[196] Food was often salted and enhanced with spices, some of which were imported like black pepper, while others were cultivated in herb gardens or harvested in the wild. Home grown spices included caraway, mustard and horseradish as evidenced from the Oseberg ship burial[185] or dill, coriander, and wild celery, as found in cesspits at Coppergate in York. Thyme, juniper berry, sweet gale, yarrow, rue and peppercress were also used and cultivated in herb gardens.[182][197] Vikings collected and ate fruits, berries and nuts. Apple (wild crab apples), plums and cherries were part of the diet,[198] as were rose hips and raspberry, wild strawberry, blackberry, elderberry, rowan, hawthorn and various wild berries, specific to the locations.[197] Hazelnuts were an important part of the diet in general and large amounts of walnut shells have been found in cities like Hedeby. The shells were used for dyeing, and it is assumed that the nuts were consumed.[182][194] The invention and introduction of the mouldboard plough revolutionised agriculture in Scandinavia in the early Viking Age and made it possible to farm even poor soils. In Ribe, grains of rye, barley, oat and wheat dated to the 8th century have been found and examined, and are believed to have been cultivated locally.[199] Grains and flour were used for making porridges, some cooked with milk, some cooked with fruit and sweetened with honey, and also various forms of bread. Remains of bread from primarily Birka in Sweden were made of barley and wheat. It is unclear if the Norse leavened their breads, but their ovens and baking utensils suggest that they did.[200] Flax was a very important crop for the Vikings: it was used for oil extraction, food consumption, and most importantly, the production of linen. More than 40% of all known textile recoveries from the Viking Age can be traced as linen. This suggests a much higher actual percentage, as linen is poorly preserved compared to wool, for example.[201] The quality of food for common people was not always particularly high. The research at Coppergate shows that the Vikings in York made bread from wholemeal flour—probably both wheat and rye—but with the seeds of cornfield weeds included. Corncockle (Agrostemma), would have made the bread dark-coloured, but the seeds are poisonous, and people who ate the bread might have become ill. Seeds of carrots, parsnip, and brassicas were also discovered, but they were poor specimens and tend to come from white carrots and bitter tasting cabbages.[198] The rotary querns often used in the Viking Age left tiny stone fragments (often from basalt rock) in the flour, which when eaten wore down the teeth. The effects of this can be seen on skeletal remains from that period.[200] Sports were widely practised and encouraged by the Vikings.[202] Sports that involved weapons training and developing combat skills were popular. These included spear and stone throwing, building and testing physical strength through wrestling (see glima), fist fighting, and stone lifting.[203] In areas with mountains, mountain climbing was practised as a sport. Agility and balance were built and tested by running and jumping for sport, and there is mention of a sport that involved jumping from oar to oar on the outside of a ship's railing as it was being rowed.[204] Swimming was a popular sport[205] – Snorri Sturluson describes three types: diving, long-distance swimming, and a contest in which two swimmers try to dunk one another. Children often participated in some of the sport disciplines,[206] and women have also been mentioned as swimmers, although it is unclear if they took part in competitions. King Olaf Tryggvason was acclaimed for his skill in both mountain climbing and oar-jumping, and reputedly excelled in the art of knife juggling as well. Skiing and ice skating were the principal winter sports, and also provided transport on snow and ice for adults.[202] Horse fighting was practised for sport, although the rules are unclear. It appears to have involved two stallions pitted against each other, within smell and sight of fenced-off mares. Whatever the rules were, the fights often resulted in the death of one of the stallions. Icelandic sources often mention knattleik, a ball game similar to hockey, played with a bat and a small hard ball, usually on a smooth surface of ice. Popular with both adults and children, it was a rugged game that often led to injuries. Knattleik appears to have been played only in Iceland, where it attracted many spectators, as did horse fighting.[202] Hunting was practiced as a sport only in Denmark, where it was not an essential food source. Deer and hares were hunted for meat, along with partridges and sea birds, while foxes were hunted to stop their killing of farm animals and for their furs. Spears, bows, and later crossbows, were the weapons used; stalking was the most common method, although game was also chased with dogs. Numerous kinds of snares and traps were used as well.[202] Archaeological finds and written sources indicate that the Vikings participated in social gatherings and festivities.[207][208] Board games and dice games were a popular pastime. Game boards were made of ornately carved wood, with gaming pieces fashioned mostly from wood, bone, or stone. Pieces were also made of glass, amber, and antler, along with materials such as walrus tusk and ivory from foreign sources. The Vikings played several types of tafl games; hnefatafl, nitavl (nine men's morris) and the less common kvatrutafl.[202] Hnefatafl was probably the oldest type of board game played in medieval Scandinavia.[202] The archaeological record indicates that hnefatafl was popular by the early medieval period, with the Vikings introducing it to England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland.[209] The Ockelbo Runestone shows two men possibly playing hnefatafl,[210] and one saga suggests that dice games involved gambling.[207] Beer and mead were served on festive occasions, where music was played, poetry was recited, and stories were told.[207] Music was considered an art form and musical skill was viewed as suitable for a cultivated man. The Vikings are known to have played instruments including harps, lutes, lyres and fiddles.[202] Elements of a Scandinavian identity and practices were maintained in settler societies, but they could be quite distinct as the groups assimilated into neighbouring societies. Assimilation to the Frankish culture in Normandy for example was rapid.[211] Links to a Viking identity remained longer in the remote islands of Iceland and the Faroes.[211] Knowledge about the arms and armour of the Viking age is based on archaeological finds, pictorial representation, and to some extent on the accounts in the Norse sagas and Norse laws recorded in the 13th century. According to custom, all free Norse men were required to own weapons and were permitted to carry them at all times. These arms indicated a Viking's social status: a wealthy Viking had a complete ensemble of a helmet, shield, mail shirt, and sword. However, swords were rarely used in battle; they were probably not sturdy enough for combat and most likely only used as symbolic or decorative items.[212][213] A typical bóndi (freeman) was more likely to fight with a spear and shield, and most also carried a seax as a utility knife and side-arm. Bows were used in the opening stages of land battles and at sea, but they tended to be considered less \"honourable\" than melee weapons. Vikings were relatively unusual for the time in their use of axes as a main battle weapon. The Húscarls, the elite guard of King Cnut (and later of King Harold II) were armed with two-handed axes that could split shields or metal helmets with ease. The warfare and violence of the Vikings were often motivated and fuelled by their beliefs in Norse religion, focusing on Thor and Odin, the gods of war and death.[214][215] Violence was common in Viking Age Norway. An examination of Norwegian human remains from the Viking Age found that 72% of the examined males and 42% of the examined females had suffered weapon-related injuries. Violence was less common in Viking Age Denmark, where society was more centralized and complex than the clan-based Norwegian society.[216] The Viking warrior is often associated with violent fits of rage and frenzied fighting in modern popular culture, as reflected in meanings attached to the words berserkergang and berserker that would not have been the meanings understood by medieval Norse society.[217] Such a fighting style may have been deployed intentionally by shock troops, and it has been proposed that the berserk-state may have been induced by consuming large amounts of alcohol,[218] or through ingestion of materials with psychoactive properties, such as the solanaceous plant Hyoscyamus niger, as speculated by Karsten Fatur[219] or by consumption of the hallucinogenic mushroom Amanita muscaria, as first hypothesised by the Swedish theologian Samuel Ødman in 1784 and later by the botanist F.C. Schübeler in 1885.[220] The Norwegian battlefield archaeologist Are Skarstein Kolberg asserts that \"...Ödman's hypothesis is not supported by the saga literature or by the archaeological record\",[221] and according to Roderick Dale, there is no evidence for it from the Viking Age or from Old Norse literature.[217] The Vikings established and engaged in extensive trading networks throughout the known world and had a profound influence on the economic development of Europe and Scandinavia.[222][223] Other than in such trading centres as Ribe Hedeby in Denmark, Scandinavia was unfamiliar with the use of coinage. Therefore, its economy was based on bullion; that is, the purity and weight of precious metals used in exchange. Silver was the precious metal most commonly used, although gold was also used. Traders carried small portable scales, enabling them to measure weight precisely, which allowed an accurate medium of exchange, even lacking a regular coinage.[224] Organised trade covered everything from ordinary items in bulk to exotic luxury products. The Viking ship designs, like that of the knarr, were an important factor in their success as merchants.[225] Imported goods from other cultures included:[226] To counter these valuable imports, the Vikings exported a large variety of goods. These goods included:[226] Other exports included weapons, walrus ivory, wax, salt and cod. As one of the more exotic exports, hunting birds were sometimes provided from Norway to the European aristocracy, from the 10th century.[234] Many of these goods were also traded within the Viking world itself, as well as goods such as soapstone and whetstone. Soapstone was traded with the Norse on Iceland and in Jutland, who used it for pottery. Whetstones were traded and used for sharpening weapons, tools and knives.[226] There are indications from Ribe and surrounding areas, that the extensive medieval trade with oxen and cattle from Jutland (see Ox Road), reach as far back as c. 720 AD. This trade satisfied the Vikings' need for leather and meat to some extent, and perhaps hides for parchment production on the European mainland. Wool was also very important as a domestic product for the Vikings, to produce warm clothing for the cold Scandinavian and Nordic climate, and for sails. Sails for Viking ships required large amounts of wool, as evidenced by experimental archaeology. There are archaeological signs of organised textile productions in Scandinavia, reaching as far back as the early Iron Ages. Artisans and craftsmen in the larger towns were supplied with antlers from organised hunting with large-scale reindeer traps in the far north. They were used as raw material for making everyday utensils like combs.[234] In England the Viking Age began dramatically on 8 June 793 when Norsemen destroyed the abbey on the island of Lindisfarne. The devastation of Northumbria's Holy Island shocked and alerted the royal courts of Europe to the Viking presence. \"Never before has such an atrocity been seen\", declared the Northumbrian scholar Alcuin of York.[236] Medieval Christians in Europe were totally unprepared for the Viking incursions and could find no explanation for their arrival and the accompanying suffering they experienced at their hands save the \"Wrath of God\".[237] More than any other single event, the attack on Lindisfarne demonised perception of the Vikings for the next twelve centuries. Not until the 1890s did scholars outside Scandinavia begin to seriously reassess the achievements of the Vikings, recognising their artistry, technological skills, and seamanship.[238] Norse Mythology, sagas, and literature tell of Scandinavian culture and religion through tales of heroic and mythological heroes. Early transmission of this information was primarily oral, and later texts relied on the writings and transcriptions of Christian scholars, including the Icelanders Snorri Sturluson and Sæmundur fróði. Many of these sagas were written in Iceland, and most of them, even if they had no Icelandic provenance, were preserved there after the Middle Ages due to the continued interest of Icelanders in Norse literature and legal codes. The 200-year Viking influence on European history is filled with tales of plunder and colonisation, and the majority of these chronicles came from western European witnesses and their descendants. Less common, although equally relevant, are references to Vikings in chronicles that originated in the east, including the Nestor chronicles, Novgorod chronicles, Ibn Fadlan chronicles, Ibn Rusta chronicles, and brief mentions by Photius, patriarch of Constantinople, regarding the first Viking attack on the Byzantine Empire. Other chroniclers of Viking history include Adam of Bremen, who wrote, in the fourth volume of his Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum, \"[t]here is much gold here (in Zealand), accumulated by piracy. These pirates, which are called wichingi by their own people, and Ascomanni by our own people, pay tribute to the Danish king.\" In 991, the Battle of Maldon between Viking raiders and the inhabitants of Maldon in Essex was commemorated with a poem of the same name. Early modern publications, dealing with what is now called Viking culture, appeared in the 16th century, e.g. Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus (History of the northern people) of Olaus Magnus (1555), and the first edition of the 13th-century Gesta Danorum (Deeds of the Danes), by Saxo Grammaticus, in 1514. The pace of publication increased during the 17th century with Latin translations of the Edda (notably Peder Resen's Edda Islandorum of 1665). In Scandinavia, the 17th-century Danish scholars Thomas Bartholin and Ole Worm and the Swede Olaus Rudbeck used runic inscriptions and Icelandic sagas as historical sources. An important early British contributor to the study of the Vikings was George Hickes, who published his Linguarum vett. septentrionalium thesaurus (Dictionary of the Old Northern Languages) in 1703–05. During the 18th century, British interest and enthusiasm for Iceland and early Scandinavian culture grew dramatically, expressed in English translations of Old Norse texts and in original poems that extolled the supposed Viking virtues. The word \"viking\" was first popularised at the beginning of the 19th century by Erik Gustaf Geijer in his poem, The Viking. Geijer's poem did much to propagate the new romanticised ideal of the Viking, which had little basis in historical fact. The renewed interest of Romanticism in the Old North had contemporary political implications. The Geatish Society, of which Geijer was a member, popularised this myth to a great extent. Another Swedish author who had great influence on the perception of the Vikings was Esaias Tegnér, a member of the Geatish Society, who wrote a modern version of Friðþjófs saga hins frœkna, which became widely popular in the Nordic countries, the United Kingdom, and Germany. Fascination with the Vikings reached a peak during the so-called Viking revival in the late 18th and 19th centuries as a form of Romantic nationalism.[239] In Britain this was called Septentrionalism, in Germany \"Wagnerian\" pathos, and in the Scandinavian countries Scandinavism. Pioneering 19th-century scholarly editions of the Viking Age began to reach a small readership in Britain. Archaeologists began to dig up Britain's Viking past, and linguistic enthusiasts started to identify the Viking-Age origins of rural idioms and proverbs. The new dictionaries of the Old Norse language enabled the Victorians to grapple with the primary Icelandic sagas.[240] Until recently, the history of the Viking Age was largely based on Icelandic sagas, the history of the Danes written by Saxo Grammaticus, the Primary Chronicle, and Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib. Few scholars still accept these texts as reliable sources, as historians now rely more on archaeology and numismatics, disciplines that have made valuable contributions toward understanding the period.[241][page needed] The romanticised idea of the Vikings constructed in scholarly and popular circles in northwestern Europe in the 19th and early 20th centuries was a potent one, and the figure of the Viking became a familiar and malleable symbol in different contexts in the politics and political ideologies of 20th-century Europe.[242] In Normandy, which had been settled by Vikings, the Viking ship became an uncontroversial regional symbol. In Germany, awareness of Viking history in the 19th century had been stimulated by the border dispute with Denmark over Schleswig-Holstein and the use of Scandinavian mythology by Richard Wagner. The idealised view of the Vikings appealed to Germanic supremacists who transformed the figure of the Viking in accordance with the ideology of a Germanic master race.[243] Building on the linguistic and cultural connections between Norse-speaking Scandinavians and other Germanic groups in the distant past, Scandinavian Vikings were portrayed in Nazi Germany as a pure Germanic type. The cultural phenomenon of Viking expansion was re-interpreted for use as propaganda to support the extreme militant nationalism of the Third Reich, and ideologically informed interpretations of Viking paganism and the Scandinavian use of runes were employed in the construction of Nazi mysticism. Other political organisations of the same ilk, such as the former Norwegian fascist party Nasjonal Samling, similarly appropriated elements of the modern Viking cultural myth in their symbolism and propaganda. Soviet and earlier Slavophile historians emphasised a Slavic rooted foundation in contrast to the Normanist theory of the Vikings conquering the Slavs and founding the Kievan Rus'.[244] They accused Normanist theory proponents of distorting history by depicting the Slavs as undeveloped primitives. In contrast, Soviet historians stated that the Slavs laid the foundations of their statehood long before the Norman/Viking raids, while the Norman/Viking invasions only served to hinder the historical development of the Slavs. They argued that Rus' composition was Slavic and that Rurik and Oleg's success was rooted in their support from within the local Slavic aristocracy.[citation needed]. After the dissolution of the USSR, Novgorod acknowledged its Viking history by incorporating a Viking ship into its logo.[245] Led by the operas of German composer Richard Wagner, such as Der Ring des Nibelungen, Vikings and the Romanticist Viking Revival have inspired many creative works. These have included novels directly based on historical events, such as Frans Gunnar Bengtsson's The Long Ships (which was also released as a 1963 film), and historical fantasies such as the film The Vikings, Michael Crichton's Eaters of the Dead (movie version called The 13th Warrior), and the comedy film Erik the Viking. The vampire Eric Northman, in the HBO TV series True Blood, was a Viking prince before being turned into a vampire. Vikings appear in several books by the Danish American writer Poul Anderson, while British explorer, historian, and writer Tim Severin authored a trilogy of novels in 2005 about a young Viking adventurer Thorgils Leifsson, who travels around the world. In 1962, American comic book writer Stan Lee and his brother Larry Lieber, together with Jack Kirby, created the Marvel Comics superhero Thor, which they based on the Norse god of the same name. The character is featured in the 2011 Marvel Studios film Thor and its sequels. The character also appears in the 2012 film The Avengers and its associated animated series. The appearance of Vikings within popular media and television has seen a resurgence in recent decades, especially with the History Channel's series Vikings (2013), directed by Michael Hirst. The show has a loose grounding in historical facts and sources, but bases itself more so on literary sources, such as fornaldarsaga Ragnars saga loðbrókar, itself more legend than fact, and Old Norse Eddic and Skaldic poetry.[246] The events of the show frequently make references to the Völuspá, an Eddic poem describing the creation of the world, often directly referencing specific lines of the poem in the dialogue.[247] The show portrays some of the social realities of the medieval Scandinavian world, such as slavery[248] and the greater role of women within Viking society.[249] The show also addresses the topics of gender equity in Viking society with the inclusion of shield maidens through the character Lagertha, also based on a legendary figure.[250] Recent archaeological interpretations and osteological analyses of previous excavations of Viking burials have given support to the idea of the Viking woman warrior, namely the excavation and DNA study of the Birka female Viking warrior, within recent years. However, the conclusions remain contentious. Vikings have served as an inspiration for numerous video games, such as The Lost Vikings (1993), Age of Mythology (2002), and For Honor (2017).[251] All three Vikings from The Lost Vikings series—Erik the Swift, Baleog the Fierce, and Olaf the Stout—appeared as a playable hero in the crossover title Heroes of the Storm (2015).[252] The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (2011) is an action role-playing video game heavily inspired by Viking culture.[253][254] Vikings are the lead focus of the 2020 video game Assassin's Creed Valhalla, which is set in 873 AD, and recounts an alternative history of the Viking invasion of Britain.[255] Modern reconstructions of Viking mythology have shown a persistent influence in late 20th- and early 21st-century popular culture in some countries, inspiring comics, movies, television series, role-playing games, computer games, and music, including Viking metal, a subgenre of heavy metal music. Since the 1960s, there has been rising enthusiasm for historical reenactment. While the earliest groups had little claim for historical accuracy, the seriousness and accuracy of reenactors has increased. The largest such groups include The Vikings and Regia Anglorum, though many smaller groups exist in Europe, North America, New Zealand, and Australia. Many reenactor groups participate in live-steel combat, and a few have Viking-style ships or boats. The Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League are so-named owing to the large Scandinavian population in the US state of Minnesota. During the banking boom of the first decade of the twenty-first century, Icelandic financiers came to be styled as útrásarvíkingar (roughly 'raiding Vikings').[256][257][258] Experimental archaeology of the Viking Age is a flourishing branch and several places have been dedicated to this technique, such as Jorvik Viking Centre in the United Kingdom, Sagnlandet Lejre and Ribe Viking Center [da] in Denmark, Foteviken Museum in Sweden or Lofotr Viking Museum in Norway. Viking-age reenactors have undertaken experimental activities such as iron smelting and forging using Norse techniques at Norstead in Newfoundland for example.[259] On 1 July 2007, the reconstructed Viking ship Skuldelev 2, renamed Sea Stallion,[260] began a journey from Roskilde to Dublin. The remains of that ship and four others were discovered during a 1962 excavation in the Roskilde Fjord. Tree-ring analysis has shown the ship was built of oak in the vicinity of Dublin in about 1042. Seventy multinational crew members sailed the ship back to its home, and Sea Stallion arrived outside Dublin's Custom House on 14 August 2007. The purpose of the voyage was to test and document the seaworthiness, speed, and manoeuvrability of the ship on the rough open sea and in coastal waters with treacherous currents. The crew tested how the long, narrow, flexible hull withstood the tough ocean waves. The expedition also provided valuable new information on Viking longships and society. The ship was built using Viking tools, materials, and much of the same methods as the original ship. Other vessels, often replicas of the Gokstad ship (full- or half-scale) or Skuldelev have been built and tested as well. The Snorri (a Skuldelev I Knarr), was sailed from Greenland to Newfoundland in 1998.[261] Apart from two or three representations of (ritual) helmets—with protrusions that may be either stylised ravens, snakes, or horns—no depiction of the helmets of Viking warriors, and no preserved helmet, has horns. The formal, close-quarters style of Viking combat (either in shield walls or aboard \"ship islands\") would have made horned helmets cumbersome and hazardous to the warrior's own side. Historians therefore believe that Viking warriors did not wear horned helmets; whether such helmets were used in Scandinavian culture for other, ritual purposes, remains unproven. The general misconception that Viking warriors wore horned helmets was partly promulgated by the 19th-century enthusiasts of Götiska Förbundet, founded in 1811 in Stockholm.[262] They promoted the use of Norse mythology as the subject of high art and other ethnological and moral aims. The Vikings were often depicted with winged helmets and in other clothing taken from Classical antiquity, especially in depictions of Norse gods. This was done to legitimise the Vikings and their mythology by associating it with the Classical world, which had long been idealised in European culture. The latter-day mythos created by national romantic ideas blended the Viking Age with aspects of the Nordic Bronze Age some 2,000 years earlier. Horned helmets from the Bronze Age were shown in petroglyphs and appeared in archaeological finds (see Bohuslän and Vikso helmets). They were probably used for ceremonial purposes.[263] Cartoons like Hägar the Horrible and Vicky the Viking, and sports kits such as those of the Minnesota Vikings and Canberra Raiders have perpetuated the myth of the horned helmet.[264] Viking helmets were conical, made from hard leather with wood and metallic reinforcements for regular troops. The iron helmet with mask and mail was for the chieftains, based on the previous Vendel-age helmets from central Sweden. The only original Viking helmet discovered is the Gjermundbu helmet, found in Norway. This helmet is made of iron and has been dated to the 10th century.[265] The image of wild-haired, dirty savages sometimes associated with the Vikings in popular culture is a distorted picture of reality.[9] Viking tendencies were often misreported, and the work of Adam of Bremen, among others, told largely disputable tales of Viking savagery and uncleanliness.[266] There is no evidence that Vikings drank out of the skulls of vanquished enemies. This was a misconception based on a passage in the skaldic poem Krákumál speaking of heroes drinking from ór bjúgviðum hausa (branches of skulls). This was a reference to drinking horns, but was mistranslated in the 17th century[267] as referring to the skulls of the slain.[268] Margaryan et al. 2020 analysed 442 Viking world individuals from various archaeological sites in Europe.[14] They were found to be closely related to modern Scandinavians. The Y-DNA composition of the individuals in the study was also similar to that of modern Scandinavians. The most common Y-DNA haplogroup was I1 (95 samples), followed by R1b (84 samples) and R1a, especially (but not exclusively) of the Scandinavian R1a-Z284 subclade (61 samples). The study showed what many historians have hypothesised: that it was common for Norseman settlers to marry foreign women. Some individuals from the study, such as those found in Foggia, displayed typical Scandinavian Y-DNA haplogroups but also southern European autosomal ancestry, suggesting that they were the descendants of Viking settler males and local women. The five individual samples from Foggia were likely Normans. The same pattern of a combination of Scandinavian Y-DNA and local autosomal ancestry is seen in other samples from the study, for example Varangians buried near lake Ladoga and Vikings in England, suggesting that Viking men had married into local families in those places too.[14] The study found evidence of a Swedish influx into Estonia and Finland; and Norwegian influx into Ireland, Iceland and Greenland during the Viking Age. However, the authors commented \"Viking Age Danish-like ancestry in the British Isles cannot be distinguished from that of the Angles and Saxons, who migrated in the fifth to sixth centuries AD from Jutland and northern Germany\".[14] Margaryan et al. 2020 examined the skeletal remains of 42 individuals from the Salme ship burials in Estonia. The skeletal remains belonged to warriors killed in battle who were later buried together with numerous valuable weapons and armour. DNA testing and isotope analysis revealed that the men came from central Sweden.[14] Female descent studies show evidence of Norse descent in areas closest to Scandinavia, such as the Shetland and Orkney islands.[269] Inhabitants of lands farther away show most Norse descent in the male Y-chromosome lines.[270] A specialised genetic and surname study in Liverpool showed marked Norse heritage: up to 50% of males of families that lived there before the years of industrialisation and population expansion.[271] High percentages of Norse inheritance—tracked through the R-M420 haplotype—were also found among males in the Wirral and West Lancashire.[272] This was similar to the percentage of Norse inheritance found among males in the Orkney Islands.[273] Recent research suggests that the Celtic warrior Somerled, who drove the Vikings out of western Scotland and was the progenitor of Clan Donald, may have been of Viking descent, a member of haplogroup R-M420.[274] Margaryan et al. 2020 examined an elite warrior burial from Bodzia (Poland) dated to 1010–1020 AD. The cemetery in Bodzia is exceptional in terms of Scandinavian and Kievian Rus links. The Bodzia man (sample VK157, or burial E864/I) was not a simple warrior from the princely retinue, but he belonged to the princely family himself. His burial is the richest one in the whole cemetery. Moreover, strontium analysis of his teeth enamel shows he was not local. It is assumed that he came to Poland with the Prince of Kiev, Sviatopolk the Accursed, and met a violent death in combat. This corresponds to the events of 1018 AD when Sviatopolk himself disappeared after having retreated from Kiev to Poland. It cannot be excluded that the Bodzia man was Sviatopolk himself, as the genealogy of the Rurikids at this period is extremely sketchy and the dates of birth of many princes of this dynasty may be quite approximative. The Bodzia man carried haplogroup I1-S2077 and had both Scandinavian ancestry and Russian admixture.[14][275]",

                "content": "The Vikings were Scandinavian people from Northern Europe who were known as great seamen and warriors. From the 8th to the 11th centuries they travelled to Europe in their long ships. They attacked and later settled in areas that are now modern Great Britain, Germany, France, Spain, and Italy.[1] The people of the far north, later called Vikings, were first noticed by the Romans around the year 100 BC.[a][6] This is when the Cimbri and the Teutons moved into southern Gaul.[6] The Romans believed these war-like tribes came from Jutland. But the Romans suspected they were only a part of a greater threat located further north.[6] The Roman historians Jordanes described the destructive Ostrogoths and Visigoths as having come from Gotland.[6] The Frankish Empire that came after them in Gaul became more and more aware of the northern threat.[6] As the later Carolingian Empire expanded into northern Germany they came into contact with the Danish people. This is when the Vikings appear in written history.[6] The first recorded raid in Britain was at Lindisfarne in 793.[7] Why the Vikings began raiding is not clear. A popular theory is the populations had grown to the point there was not enough food to feed everyone.[8] The earliest raiders did not seem to want to move out of Scandinavia. They turned to looting, then returning home. These raids were possible because the Vikings were master boat builders. They made flat bottomed boats ideal for journeys up rivers. Many monasteries were on the rivers and were raided. [9] Raiding was easy. It became more and more popular among the Vikings.[8] Three different groups of Vikings took different, sometimes overlapping, routes.[8] Europeans were scared of the Vikings because of their strong weapons, swift attacks, and cruel fighting tactics. They were known for their bad treatment of women, children and monks in the places where they fought. When the Vikings came to England, the English kings paid them to leave the country. The Vikings took their money and sometimes fought them anyway. These payments were called Danegeld. From the 9th century to 1066, when the Duke of Normandy, who became King William I of England, conquered it, Danish and Norwegian Vikings ruled large parts of England. Because of their longships, which could float in 4 feet (1.3m) of water, the Vikings were able to make their way up rivers and land deep inside a country. They sailed up the River Shannon in Ireland and built a harbour 60 miles (100 km) from the coast. There was a difference in who led Viking raids. In the 9th century, Viking Age raids were led by men who may have been exiles in their own countries.[10] The later Viking raids in the late 10th century and early 11th century and were led by Kings.[10] Some of the early leaders tried to become kings with the riches they plundered from Europe and Russia. Some were successful but most were not.[10] The Vikings were called Rus' by the peoples east of the Baltic Sea.[11] The Vikings who settled in Kiev formed the first Russian state.[11] The Vikings (Rus') who served the Byzantine Emperors were called Varangians. They became the personal bodyguards to the Emperor and were called the Varangian Guard.[12] The Vikings travelled through Russia, the Mediterranean Sea, southern Europe, northern Africa and south-western Asia. Some Vikings sailed across the Atlantic Ocean via Iceland and Greenland and may have explored places in North America. The ruins of a Viking settlement have been found at L'Anse-aux-Meadows, Newfoundland.[13][14] Archaeologists used radiocarbon dating to find out how old the settlement was. Their tests gave them a range of dates from about AD 700 to about AD 1000.[15] Some English words, and many place names, come from the Scandinavian and Viking language (Norse). For example, the words skirt and shirt came from the word skyrta, meaning a tunic. As English changed, the semantics altered to give us the separate words 'skirt' and 'shirt' we know today. Skin came from the Norse word skinn (which meant to strip the meat off something). Some place-names in the areas the Vikings conquered are still in use.[16] For example, in Yorkshire places ending with thwaite meant a clearing[17] and dale meant a valley. The word thorpe meant new village, such as Scunthorpe.[18] The Anglo-Saxons called the Vikings pagans. They worshiped many gods. Viking gods belonged to two groups of gods in Norse mythology, the Aesir and the Vanir.[19] The pagan Vikings were exposed to Christianity from the beginning of the Viking Age.[20] They were surrounded by Christian countries. Early Christian missionaries were either enslaved or put to death.[21] The Vikings came into contact with Christianity when they raided other areas around them.[20] Viking raids produced many Christian slaves who were brought back to Scandinavia. They called Christians \"Cross-men\" because of the cross in their worship.[22] Many Vikings used Thors hammer as their religious symbol. When Vikings settled in Christian areas they converted to Christianity. There are still headstones in England with both a cross and a hammer. Perhaps they thought it was better to be safe than sorry.[20] That, or the more gods the better. As some Vikings turned from raiding to trading they found a nominal (in name only) profession of Christianity to be helpful.[23] Scandinavia, their homeland, was slower to change to the Christian religion. By the mid-11th century most of Norway and Denmark had converted. Sweden was converted by the mid-12th century.[20] The Viking's religion affected Christianity as well. The pagan celebration of Yuletide became Christmas.[22] Priests blessing the fields took the place of pagan fertility rites of spring held to make sure there was a good harvest.[22] Norse kept their \"farm gods\" well after Christianity just to make sure they were protected. Santa Claus owes much of his legend to the Norse god Odin. With his snow-white beard he traveled the midwinter sky on his eight-footed steed Sleipnir visiting his people with gifts. He became Father Christmas. Blended with the Christian Saint Nicholas he became Santa Claus. [22] In the late 19th century Richard Wagner and other artists in the Romantic period made operas and other artwork about ancient Germanic culture. They liked the Vikings because they were not Greeks or Romans. They came up with the idea of Vikings wearing fur clothes and helmets with wings or horns on them and drinking out of hollowed-out animal horns. Some ancient Germans wore helmets with horns on them, but real Vikings did not. Wagner and his partners dressed the actors in the opera Ring des Nibelungen so they would look like ancient Germans and so the audience would feel like modern Germans came from medieval Vikings.[24][25]",

From here they travelled great distances, mainly by sea and river – as far as North America to the west, Russia to the east, Lapland to the north and the Mediterranean World (Constantinople) and Iraq (Baghdad) to the south. We know about them through archaeology, poetry, sagas and proverbs, treaties, and the writings of people in Europe and Asia whom they encountered. They left very little written evidence themselves. As well as warriors, they were skilled craftsmen and boat-builders, adventurous explorers and wide-ranging traders. See Viking trade and Viking travel. What we call the Viking Age, and their relationship with England, lasted from approximately 800 to 1150 AD – though Scandinavian adventurers, merchants and mercenaries were of course active before and after this period. Their expansion during the Viking Age took the form of warfare, exploration, settlement and trade. During this period, around 200,000 people left Scandinavia to settle in other lands, mainly Newfoundland (Canada), Greenland, Iceland, Ireland, England, Scotland, the islands around Britain, France (where they became the Normans), Russia and Sicily. They traded extensively with the Muslim world and fought as mercenaries for the Byzantine emperors of Constantinople (Istanbul). However, by the end of the 11th century the great days of Viking expansion were over. Vikings in Britain: background and legacy Historians disagree about the origin of the word Viking. In Old Norse the word means a pirate raid, from either vikja (to move swiftly) or vik (an inlet). This captures the essence of the Vikings, fast-moving sailors who used the water as their highway to take them across the northern Atlantic, around the coasts of Europe and up its rivers to trade, raid or settle. In their poetry they call the sea 'the whale road'. Anglo-Saxon writers called them Danes, Norsemen, Northmen, the Great Army, sea rovers, sea wolves, or the heathen. From around 860AD onwards, Vikings stayed, settled and prospered in Britain, becoming part of the mix of people who today make up the British nation. Our names for days of the week come mainly from Norse gods – Tuesday from Tiw or Týr, Wednesday from Woden (Odin), Thursday from Thor and so on. Many of their other words have also become part of English, for example egg, steak, law, die, bread, down, fog, muck, lump and scrawny. To see questions children have asked about the Vikings, see our Viking starter lesson. A short history of the Vikings in Britain In 793 came the first recorded Viking raid, where 'on the Ides of June the harrying of the heathen destroyed God's church on Lindisfarne, bringing ruin and slaughter' (The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle). These ruthless pirates continued to make regular raids around the coasts of England, looting treasure and other goods, and capturing people as slaves. Monasteries were often targeted, for their precious silver or gold chalices, plates, bowls and crucifixes. Gradually, the Viking raiders began to stay, first in winter camps, then settling in land they had seized, mainly in the east and north of England. See The Vikings settle down. Outside Anglo-Saxon England, to the north of Britain, the Vikings took over and settled Iceland, the Faroes and Orkney, becoming farmers and fishermen, and sometimes going on summer trading or raiding voyages. Orkney became powerful, and from there the Earls of Orkney ruled most of Scotland. To this day, especially on the north-east coast, many Scots still bear Viking names. To the west of Britain, the Isle of Man became a Viking kingdom. The island still has its Tynwald, or ting-vollr (assembly field), a reminder of Viking rule. In Ireland, the Vikings raided around the coasts and up the rivers. They founded the cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick as Viking strongholds. Meanwhile, back in England, the Vikings took over Northumbria, East Anglia and parts of Mercia. In 866 they captured modern York (Viking name: Jorvik) and made it their capital. They continued to press south and west. The kings of Mercia and Wessex resisted as best they could, but with little success until the time of Alfred of Wessex, the only king of England to be called ‘the Great'. King Alfred and the Danes King Alfred ruled from 871-899 and after many trials and tribulations (including the famous story of the burning of the cakes!) he defeated the Vikings at the Battle of Edington in 878. After the battle the Viking leader Guthrum converted to Christianity. In 886 Alfred took London from the Vikings and fortified it. The same year he signed a treaty with Guthrum. The treaty partitioned England between Vikings and English. The Viking territory became known as the Danelaw. It comprised the north-west, the north-east and east of England. Here, people would be subject to Danish laws. Alfred became king of the rest. Alfred's grandson, Athelstan, became the first true King of England. He led an English victory over the Vikings at the Battle of Brunaburh in 937, and his kingdom for the first time included the Danelaw. In 954, Eirik Bloodaxe, the last Viking king of York, was killed and his kingdom was taken over by English earls. See Egils Saga. Later Viking raids and rulers However, the Viking raiding did not stop – different Viking bands made regular raiding voyages around the coasts of Britain for over 300 years after 793. In 991, during the reign of Æthelred 'the Unready' ('ill-advised'), Olaf Tryggvason's Viking raiding party defeated the Anglo-Saxon defenders (recorded in the poem The Battle of Maldon), with Æthelred responding by paying 'Danegeld' in an attempt to buy off the Vikings. So the Vikings were not permanently defeated – England was to have four Viking kings between 1013 and 1042. The greatest of these was King Cnut, who was king of Denmark as well as of England. A Christian, he did not force the English to obey Danish law; instead he recognised Anglo-Saxon law and customs. He worked to create a north Atlantic empire that united Scandinavia and Britain. Unfortunately, he died at the age of 39, and his sons had short, troubled reigns. The final Viking invasion of England came in 1066, when Harald Hardrada sailed up the River Humber and marched to Stamford Bridge with his men. His battle banner was called Land-waster. The English king, Harold Godwinson, marched north with his army and defeated Hardrada in a long and bloody battle. The English had repelled the last invasion from Scandinavia. However, immediately after the battle, King Harold heard that William of Normandy had landed in Kent with yet another invading army. With no time to rest, Harold's army marched swiftly back south to meet this new threat. The exhausted English army fought the Normans at the Battle of Hastings on 14th October, 1066. At the end of a long day's fighting the Normans had won, King Harold was dead, and William was the new king of England. The irony is that William was of Viking descent: his great-great-great-grandfather Rollo was a Viking who in 911 had invaded Normandy in northern France. His people had become French over time, but in one sense this final successful invasion of England was another Viking one.

These ruthless pirates continued to make regular raids around the coasts of England, looting treasure and other goods, and capturing people as slaves. Monasteries were often targeted, for their precious silver or gold chalices, plates, bowls and crucifixes. Gradually, the Viking raiders began to stay, first in winter camps, then settling in land they had seized, mainly in the east and north of England. See The Vikings settle down. Outside Anglo-Saxon England, to the north of Britain, the Vikings took over and settled Iceland, the Faroes and Orkney, becoming farmers and fishermen, and sometimes going on summer trading or raiding voyages. Orkney became powerful, and from there the Earls of Orkney ruled most of Scotland. To this day, especially on the north-east coast, many Scots still bear Viking names. To the west of Britain, the Isle of Man became a Viking kingdom. The island still has its Tynwald, or ting-vollr (assembly field), a reminder of Viking rule. In Ireland, the Vikings raided around the coasts and up the rivers. They founded the cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick as Viking strongholds. Meanwhile, back in England, the Vikings took over Northumbria, East Anglia and parts of Mercia. In 866 they captured modern York (Viking name: Jorvik) and made it their capital. They continued to press south and west. The kings of Mercia and Wessex resisted as best they could, but with little success until the time of Alfred of Wessex, the only king of England to be called ‘the Great'. King Alfred ruled from 871-899 and after many trials and tribulations (including the famous story of the burning of the cakes!) he defeated the Vikings at the Battle of Edington in 878. After the battle the Viking leader Guthrum converted to Christianity. In 886 Alfred took London from the Vikings and fortified it. The same year he signed a treaty with Guthrum. The treaty partitioned England between Vikings and English. The Viking territory became known as the Danelaw. It comprised the north-west, the north-east and east of England. Here, people would be subject to Danish laws. Alfred became king of the rest. Alfred's grandson, Athelstan, became the first true King of England. He led an English victory over the Vikings at the Battle of Brunaburh in 937, and his kingdom for the first time included the Danelaw. In 954, Eirik Bloodaxe, the last Viking king of York, was killed and his kingdom was taken over by English earls. See Egils Saga. However, the Viking raiding did not stop – different Viking bands made regular raiding voyages around the coasts of Britain for over 300 years after 793. In 991, during the reign of Æthelred 'the Unready' ('ill-advised'), Olaf Tryggvason's Viking raiding party defeated the Anglo-Saxon defenders (recorded in the poem The Battle of Maldon), with Æthelred responding by paying 'Danegeld' in an attempt to buy off the Vikings. So the Vikings were not permanently defeated – England was to have four Viking kings between 1013 and 1042. The greatest of these was King Cnut, who was king of Denmark as well as of England. A Christian, he did not force the English to obey Danish law; instead he recognised Anglo-Saxon law and customs. He worked to create a north Atlantic empire that united Scandinavia and Britain. Unfortunately, he died at the age of 39, and his sons had short, troubled reigns. The final Viking invasion of England came in 1066, when Harald Hardrada sailed up the River Humber and marched to Stamford Bridge with his men. His battle banner was called Land-waster. The English king, Harold Godwinson, marched north with his army and defeated Hardrada in a long and bloody battle. The English had repelled the last invasion from Scandinavia. However, immediately after the battle, King Harold heard that William of Normandy had landed in Kent with yet another invading army. With no time to rest, Harold's army marched swiftly back south to meet this new threat. The exhausted English army fought the Normans at the Battle of Hastings on 14th October, 1066. At the end of a long day's fighting the Normans had won, King Harold was dead, and William was the new king of England. The irony is that William was of Viking descent: his great-great-great-grandfather Rollo was a Viking who in 911 had invaded Normandy in northern France. His people had become French over time, but in one sense this final successful invasion of England was another Viking one. Home Primary Secondary Student Historian Events Publications Podcasts",

There are many theories about its origins. The Old Norse word víkingr usually meant “pirate” or “raider.” It was in use from the 12th to the 14th century, and it was likely derived from an earlier Old Scandinavian word contemporary to the Vikings themselves. The Vikings were raiders, pirates, traders, explorers, and colonizers during the 9th to 11th century. They often traveled by sea from Scandinavia and took control of areas of Europe and beyond. The Vikings’ original religion was the pagan and polytheistic Old Norse religion, which can be traced back to about 500 BCE in what is now Denmark. As Christianity took hold in Scandinavia, beginning in the 8th century CE, its followers dwindled in numbers. However, this older tradition continued Viking culture. The defeat of the king of Norway, Harald III Sigurdsson, at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066 is considered the end of the age of Viking raids. A number of broader factors contributed to the Vikings’ decline: more and more communities previously attacked by Vikings became better able to defend themselves, with armies and fortifications; Christianity’s spread in Europe; and less egalitarianism in Viking society. The stereotype of Viking helmets having horns goes back to costuming in 19th-century opera. In reality, horned helmets would have been impractical during combat. They may have been worn only for ceremonial purposes in pre-Viking times. The main style of actual helmets was the spangenhelm, consisting of several pieces of iron riveted together. Viking men would normally wear a woolen overtunic, linen undertunic, either tight or baggy trousers without pockets, woolen leg wrappings, and waterproof leather shoes. Vikings’ typical wartime apparel included the spangenhelm helmet and lamellar or leather armour or chain mail. Viking society was organized into three classes: karls, who were freemen and landowners; jarls, who were wealthy nobles tasked with maintaining the well being of their subjects; and thralls, who were either slaves or bondsmen, the latter having to work for other men until they could pay their debts. Viking women were able to own property and divorce their husbands, and they often ran their family’s finances and farms in their husbands’ absence. There are also a few records of women dressed like men learning to use swords and fighting—so-called “shieldmaidens,” the most famous of whom was Lagertha, the wife of Ragnar Lothbrok. The Vikings originated from the area that became modern-day Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. They settled in England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Iceland, Greenland, North America, and parts of the European mainland, among other places. The impact of Viking raids on Europe included a greater Scandinavian influence on language in conquered areas. For example, in English the weekdays Thursday and Friday are named after the Nordic deities Thor and Frigg, also called Freyja. The Viking raids also left a literary legacy of sagas as well as an imprint on the DNA of local populations. Viking, member of the Scandinavian seafaring warriors who raided and colonized wide areas of Europe from the 9th to the 11th century and whose disruptive influence profoundly affected European history. These pagan Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish warriors were probably prompted to undertake their raids by a combination of factors ranging from overpopulation at home to the relative helplessness of victims abroad. The Vikings were made up of landowning chieftains and clan heads, their retainers, freemen, and any energetic young clan members who sought adventure and booty overseas. At home these Scandinavians were independent farmers, but at sea they were raiders and pillagers. During the Viking period the Scandinavian countries seem to have possessed a practically inexhaustible surplus of manpower, and leaders of ability, who could organize groups of warriors into conquering bands and armies, were seldom lacking. These bands would negotiate the seas in their longships and mount hit-and-run raids at cities and towns along the coasts of Europe. Their burning, plundering, and killing earned them the name víkingr, meaning “pirate” in the early Scandinavian languages. The exact ethnic composition of the Viking armies is unknown in particular cases, but the Vikings’ expansion in the Baltic lands and in Russia can reasonably be attributed to the Swedes. Elsewhere, the nonmilitary colonization of the Orkney Islands, the Faroe Islands, and Iceland was clearly accomplished by the Norwegians. In England desultory raiding occurred in the late 8th century (notably the raid on the monastery of Lindisfarne [Holy Island] in 793) but began more earnestly in 865, when a force led by the sons of Ragnar Lothbrok—Halfdan, Inwaer (Ivar the Boneless), and perhaps Hubba (Ubbe)—conquered the ancient kingdoms of East Anglia and Northumbria and reduced Mercia to a fraction of its former size. Yet it was unable to subdue the Wessex of Alfred the Great, with whom in 878 a truce was made, which became the basis of a treaty in or soon after 886. This recognized that much of England was in Danish hands. Although hard pressed by fresh armies of Vikings from 892 to 899, Alfred was finally victorious over them, and the spirit of Wessex was so little broken that his son Edward the Elder was able to commence the reconquest of Danish England. Before his death in 924 the small Danish states on old Mercian and East Anglian territory had fallen before him. The more remote Northumbria resisted longer, largely under Viking leaders from Ireland, but the Scandinavian power there was finally liquidated by Eadred in 954. Viking raids on England began again in 980, and the country ultimately became part of the empire of Canute. Nevertheless, the native house was peacefully restored in 1042, and the Viking threat ended with the ineffective passes made by Canute II in the reign of William I. The Scandinavian conquests in England left deep marks on the areas affected—in social structure, dialect, place-names, and personal names (see Danelaw). In the western seas, Scandinavian expansion touched practically every possible point. Settlers poured into Iceland from at least about 900, and, from Iceland, colonies were founded in Greenland and attempted in North America. The same period saw settlements arise in the Orkney, Faroe, and Shetland islands, the Hebrides, and the Isle of Man. Two Norse sagas—Grænlendinga saga (“Saga of the Greenlanders”) and Eiríks saga rauða (“Erik the Red’s Saga”)—offer somewhat different accounts of the first Viking visits to North America, which they called Vinland (land of wild grapes). According to the Grænlendinga saga, the first European to sight mainland North America was Bjarni Herjólfsson, whose Greenland-bound ship was blown westward off course about 985 and apparently skirted the coastline of eastern Canada before returning to Greenland. This tradition contends that about 1000 a crew of 35 men led by Leif Eriksson, son of Erik the Red, went in search of the land sighted by Bjarni and found their way to eastern Canada. Subsequent voyages were said to have been undertaken by Leif’s brothers, and another voyage led by Icelandic trader Thorfinn Karlsefni reportedly remained in Vinland for some three years. Eiríks saga rauða presents Leif as Vinland’s accidental discoverer. Thorfinn and his wife, Gudrid, are credited with all subsequent exploration. Archaeological discoveries at L’Anse aux Meadows, on the northern tip of Newfoundland island (Newfoundland and Labrador), proved that the Vikings did travel at least as far south as areas where grapes grew wild, leading to the conclusion that the Vikings first encountered North America in eastern New Brunswick (the closest area to L’Anse aux Meadows where grapes would have been found). Scandinavian invasions of Ireland are recorded from 795, when Rechru, an island not identified, was ravaged. Thenceforth fighting was incessant, and, although the natives often more than held their own, Scandinavian kingdoms arose at Dublin, Limerick, and Waterford. The kings of Dublin for a time felt strong enough for foreign adventure, and in the early 10th century several of them ruled in both Dublin and Northumberland. The likelihood that Ireland would be unified under Scandinavian leadership passed with the Battle of Clontarf in 1014, when the Irish Scandinavians, supported by the earl of Orkney and some native Irish, suffered disastrous defeat. Yet in the 12th century the English invaders of Ireland found the Scandinavians still dominant (though Christianized) at Dublin, Waterford, Limerick, Wexford, and Cork.",
