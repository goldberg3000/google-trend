                "content": "The Penn State Nittany Lions team represents the Pennsylvania State University in college football. The Nittany Lions compete in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision as a member of the Big Ten Conference, which they joined in 1993 after playing as an Independent from 1892 to 1992.[3][4][5] Established in 1887, the Nittany Lions have achieved numerous on-field successes, including two consensus national championships in 1982 and 1986; four Big Ten Conference Championships in 1994, 2005, 2008, and 2016; 13 undefeated seasons in 1887, 1894, 1909, 1911, 1912, 1920, 1921, 1947, 1968, 1969, 1973, 1986 and 1994; and 53 appearances in college bowl games, with an all-time post-season bowl record of 32–20–2. The team ranks seventh among NCAA Division I college football programs in all-time total wins.[6] The Nittany Lions play their home games at Beaver Stadium, located on-campus in University Park, Pennsylvania. The first recorded game in Penn State football history occurred on November 12, 1881, when Penn State traveled to Lewisburg, Pennsylvania to play Bucknell, known until 1886 as the University at Lewisburg. Penn State won 9–0, which was nine goals to none. At the time, this was really a game of \"American rugby\". The father of American football, Walter Camp, did not develop the \"scrimmage\", the \"first down\" and the \"gridiron\" (yard markings) until 1882. Although this game was reported in two State College newspapers and the Mirror (University at Lewisburg campus newspaper), Bucknell denies that this game ever happened. Penn State did not field teams from 1882 through 1886. Penn State played its first season in 1887,[7] but had no head coach for their first five years, from 1887 to 1891.[7] The teams played its home games on the Old Main lawn on campus in State College, Pennsylvania. They compiled a 12–8–1 record in these seasons, playing as an independent from 1887 to 1890. In 1891, the Pennsylvania Intercollegiate Football Association (PIFA) was formed. It consisted of Bucknell (University at Lewisburg), Dickinson, Franklin & Marshall, Haverford, Penn State and Swarthmore. Lafayette and Lehigh were excluded because it was felt they would dominate the Association. Penn State won the championship with a 4–1–0 record. Bucknell's record was 3–1–1 (losing to Franklin & Marshall and tying Dickinson). The Association was dissolved prior to the 1892 season.[7] George W. Hoskins was the first head football coach at Penn State.[8] He posted a 17–4–4 record in his from 1892 to 1895 as head coach, and his .760 winning percentage ranks highest in program history.[8] His first team played its home game on the Old Main lawn on campus in State College, Pennsylvania, before the 500-seat Beaver Field opened in 1893.[8] He was succeeded by Samuel B. Newton,[citation needed] who posted a 12–14 (.462) record in three seasons, 1896–1898.[9] Sam Boyle coached for only one year in 1899 and compiled a 4–6–1 record (.409).[10] Pop Golden coached the Nittany Lions for three seasons from 1900 to 1902, tallying a record of 16–12–1 (.569).[11] Daniel A. Reed took over for the 1903 season and went 5–3 (.625).[12] Tom Fennell coached the Nittany Lions for five seasons from 1904 to 1908, posting a 33–17–1 (.657) record.[13] In 1907 the school adopted the Nittany Lion mascot, a mountain lion named after nearby Mount Nittany.[14][page needed] An early mascot was \"Old Coaly\", a mule that hauled stone for the original Old Main (completed in 1863 and demolished in 1929). Bill Hollenback took over the Nittany Lions as head coach for the 1909 season and went undefeated at 5–0–2,[15] but left for Missouri for 1910.[16] Bill's older brother Jack Hollenback took over for the 1910 season and went 5–2–1 (.688),[17] but Bill returned to Penn State from 1911 to 1914.[citation needed] Bill went 23–9–2 in his second tenure for a combined record of 28–9–4 (.732).[15] In 1911 and 1912, his teams went 8–0–1 and 8–0 and were awarded retroactive national championships by the National Championship Foundation which are recognized by the NCAA.[15] Head coach Dick Harlow brought a new form of defense, trying to go in-between or around offensive blockers rather than try to overpower them.[18][non-primary source needed] Harlow's Nittany Lions compiled a 20–8 (.714) record in his three seasons (1915–1917)[19] and was later inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach for his accomplishments.[18] Hugo Bezdek was Penn State's head football coach for 12 seasons[20] and was the Nittany Lions' first athletics director.[21] Bezdek posted a 65–30–11 record,[20] which included two undefeated seasons and a berth in the 1922 Rose Bowl, a game they lost.[20] Bezdek's Nittany Lions posted a losing record in only two of Bezdek's seasons, going 1–2–1 in 1918 and 3–5–1 in 1928.[20] Bezdek retired after the 1929 season and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1954.[21] Bob Higgins returned to his alma mater and served as Penn State's head football coach for 19 seasons.[22] He compiled a 91–57–11 overall record, which included 11 winning seasons and only five losing seasons.[22] Higgins' 1947 team tied SMU in the Cotton Bowl.[23] Higgins was forced to retire due to poor health following the 1948 season.[23] He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1954.[23] For one season, Joe Bedenk, also a Penn State alum, served as the Nittany Lions' head football coach.[24] He was promoted from offensive line coach after the retirement of his predecessor.[25] Bedenk posted a 5–4 record in his 1949,[24] his lone season as head coach, before requesting to return to his previous post as offensive line coach.[25] Rip Engle came to Penn State from Brown.[26][27] Engle posted a 104–48–4 record during his 16-season tenure as head coach and developed a game known as Angleball as a way for his players to maintain fitness in the off-season.[26][27] Engle never had a losing season at Penn State, and his 5–5 final season was his only non-winning season.[28] His 1959 and 1960 Nittany Lions teams won the Liberty Bowl, while his 1961 and 1962 teams reached the Gator Bowl, winning the first and losing the second.[28] Engle retired following the 1965 season and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1973.[26] Penn State assistant Joe Paterno was promoted to head coach following the retirement of Engle.[25] Paterno spent 46 seasons as the head football coach, the longest tenure of any head coach in the FBS, and 16 more seasons as an assistant, making his 62 total years coaching at Penn State the most of any coach at any school.[25] Under Paterno, Penn State played as an Independent from 1966 to 1992,[25] and he continued to coach them when they joined the Big Ten Conference in 1993–2011.[25] He also served as Penn State's athletic director from 1980 to 1982. His final record is 409–136–3.[29] His teams won national championships in 1982 and 1986,[29] posted non-losing records in all seasons but five,[29] and appeared in 37 bowl games with 24 wins.[29] His teams also won the Orange Bowl in 1968, 1969, 1973 and 2005;[29] the Fiesta Bowl in 1977, 1980, 1981, 1986, 1991 and 1996;[29] the Sugar Bowl in 1982; and the Rose Bowl in 1994.[29] In June 1990,[30] Penn State's athletics program, after a century as a Division I-A independent, joined the Big Ten Conference. Beaver Stadium was expanded six times during Paterno's tenure. He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2006 and was a major reason why the longtime rule of waiting until retirement to be inducted into the Hall of Fame was changed to any coach over 75 years of age.[25] Players including Kerry Collins, Charlie Zapiec, Matt Millen, Shane Conlan, Jack Ham, Dennis Onkotz, Franco Harris, Greg Buttle, Keith Dorney, John Cappelletti, Curt Warner, Larry Johnson, LaVar Arrington and Ted Kwalick played collegiately for him.[31] He won numerous coaching and sportsman honors during his long run at Penn State.[29] Paterno has the most wins in FBS football (409). Following the Pennsylvania Attorney General's release of a grand jury summary of child sexual abuse charges involving former assistant Jerry Sandusky,[32] the Penn State board of trustees fired Paterno in November 2011.[32][33] Defensive coordinator Tom Bradley finished out the 2011 season as interim head coach after Paterno's ouster.[34] In July 2012, the NCAA decided to vacate all of the team's wins from 1998 to 2011. Paterno's statue outside Beaver Stadium was also taken down.[35] The revised record dropped Paterno from first to twelfth on the all-time wins list,[36] but on January 16, 2015, the NCAA restored Paterno's vacated wins, and thus his record as the winningest FBS football coach.[37] To many he is \"The best Penn State head coach ever.\"[38] New England Patriots offensive coordinator Bill O'Brien was hired as the 15th head football coach at Penn State, taking over the Nittany Lions football program in January 2012.[39] Early in O'Brien's tenure, the NCAA sanctioned Penn State with a four-season postseason ban and a loss of 40 scholarships due to the child sex abuse scandal.[40] O'Brien posted an 8–4 record in his first season as head coach of the Nittany Lions.[41] O'Brien's 2013 Nittany Lions team posted a 7–5 record in the second of four years they were ineligible for the postseason.[42] In January 2014, Bill O'Brien left Penn State to accept the head coaching position with the NFL's Houston Texans.[43] On January 11, 2014, Vanderbilt head coach James Franklin was hired as the 16th Penn State head football coach.[44] He is the first African American head football coach at Penn State.[45] In Franklin's first year, the NCAA lifted Penn State's postseason ban and the Nittany Lions were bowl eligible. The Nittany Lions were named to the Pinstripe Bowl where they won against Boston College on December 27, 2014, at Yankee Stadium.[46] To start off the 2015 season, Penn State lost to Temple 27–10, its first loss to the Owls since 1941. The loss was followed by victories against Buffalo, Rutgers, San Diego State, Army and Indiana. The Nittany Lions then lost to Ohio State 38–10 in Columbus before winning, 31–30, at Maryland. The victory against Maryland brought the Nittany Lions to six wins, making them bowl eligible for the second year since the postseason ban was lifted. Penn State then shut out the Illinois 39–0 in the second to last home game of the 2015 season. They then lost to Michigan in Happy Valley 28–16 and to Michigan State 55–16 at MSU. The win–loss record for Penn State in the 2015 regular season was 7–5, and 7–6 after a loss to Georgia in the Taxslayer Bowl in Jacksonville. The 2016 season featured an upset over No. 2 Ohio State during a \"White-Out\" in State College. Following the win, Penn State was ranked 24th in the AP Poll, its first ranking since 2011.[47] Penn State finished the regular season 10–2, 8–1 in Big Ten play. After winning a tiebreaker against rivals Ohio State, Penn State went on to claim the Big Ten East title and a spot in the Big Ten Championship game in Indianapolis against Big Ten West champion Wisconsin, which they won after trailing 28–14 in the first half. They outscored the Badgers 24–3 in the second half to take home the Nittany Lions' fourth Big Ten Title.[48] On August 18, 2017, Penn State announced that Franklin signed a six-year contract extension worth $5.738 million a year.[49] That deal includes retention bonuses paid at the end of each year of the contract. \"My family and I are very thankful to be a part of the Penn State community,\" Franklin said in a statement. \"I am pleased with the progress our program has made in the community, in the classroom and on the field. I look forward to diligently working with President Barron and Director of Athletics Sandy Barbour on implementing a plan that puts our University and our student-athletes in the best position to compete on the field and in life.\"[50] In addition to the guaranteed money, Franklin's contract extension has incentives including $800,000 for a national title, $400,000 for a College Football Playoff appearance and $350,000 for winning the Big Ten Championship Game. His incentives are capped at $1 million per year.[51] Penn State went to 7–0 to begin the 2017 season, before losing on consecutive weekends to Ohio State and Michigan State. Penn State finished the regular season with wins over Rutgers Nebraska and Maryland. Penn State capped the 2017 season at the Fiesta Bowl, beating Washington, 35–28.[52] In 2018 the Lions went 9–4 with a loss to Kentucky in the Citrus Bowl. The 2019 season was spectacular for Penn State going 11–2 with the losses only to Minnesota by 26–31 and to Ohio State and beat American Athletic Conference Champion Memphis who at that time was 12–1. Penn State beat Memphis 53–39 in the Cotton Bowl. The 2020 season was James Franklin's first losing season with the Nittany Lions. They started off the season with COVID-19 pandemic spring cancelations. Penn State traveled to Bloomington to take on Indiana where they lost in overtime 35–36 with Michael Penix Jr.'s pendulum touch two-point conversion winning the Game for Indiana. The Nittany Lions took on Ohio State at home with no whiteout due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Penn State lost 25–38. The Nittany Lions took on Maryland who they had not lost to since 2014. The Terrapins beat Penn State 19–35 in Beaver Stadium. The Nittany Lions traveled to Nebraska to take on the Nebraska Cornhuskers where the Nittany Lions comeback fell short and lost 23–30. The Nittany Lions fought the Iowa Hawkeyes but lost 21–41 giving Penn State its first ever 0–5 start in its history. The Nittany Lions, determined to win, traveled to Ann Arbor to defeat the Michigan Wolverines. Penn State got its first victory of the season 27–17 going 1–5. Penn State took on the Rutgers Scarlet Knights in Piscataway where they won again 23–7 thus giving them a 2–5 record. Penn State went home to take on the Michigan State. They trailed 10–21 at halftime but rallied back to win 39–24 getting a 3–5 record. For the Big Ten Championship week Penn State hosted the Fighting Illini at home. Penn State won in rout 56–21 going to a 4–5 record. Penn State players voted to not accept a bowl invitation so their final record was 4–5. A major offseason change was replacing first-year offensive coordinator Kirk Ciarrocca with Texas offensive coordinator Mike Yurcich. James Franklin is currently under a ten-year $75,000,000 contract (as of 2021). In 2021, Penn State improved upon its lackluster 2020 season going 7–6. The Nittany Lions finished the season unranked and with a 4–5 Big Ten Conference record. They went 2–3 on the road while maintaining a winning 5–2 record at Beaver Stadium. The season started strong on September 4, 2021, when Penn State defeated the #12 ranked Wisconsin Badgers football team. They won their next 4 games including a 28–20 win over the #22 Auburn Tigers football team. Then they began to struggle after a close 23–20 loss to the #3 Iowa Hawkeyes on the road October 9, 2021. On October 23, 2021, Penn State battled the Illinois Fighting Illini through an NCAA record 9 overtimes, eventually losing 20–18. The teams both scored fieldgoals in the first 2 overtimes, tying the score 16–16. Neither team scored until the 8th overtime when Illinois finally broke the stalemate, quickly followed by a run from Penn State's Noah Cain. Penn State did not score during its first conversion attempt in overtime 9, leaving the door open for Illinois to eventually score and win the game.[53] The Nittany Lions' only subsequent wins came against Maryland (31–14) and Rutgers (28–0). They closed out the 2021 season playing Arkansas at the Outback Bowl, losing the game 24–10.[54] Penn State has a strong 2022 campaign losing to only Michigan and Ohio State and defeating Pac 12 champion Utah in the 2023 Rose Bowl. Penn State has also been named national champions on seven occasions by NCAA-designated major selectors.[55][56]: 111–115 Penn State claims the 1982 and 1986 championships under Joe Paterno's tenure,[57] both of which are consensus national championships.[56]: 120 Historically, Penn State played as an independent from 1887 through 1890, then in 1891 as a member of the Pennsylvania Intercollegiate Football Association Penn State won the PIFA championship with a 4–1–0 PIFA record, losing only to Bucknell (Bucknell's record was 3–1–1). The PIFA dissolved prior to the 1892 season. Penn State then played as an independent again until joining the Big Ten Conference in 1990 and beginning play in 1993. Penn State then won its first Big Ten championship in 1994, they won two more in 2005 and 2008, and they won a fourth under James Franklin in 2016. † Co-champions † Co-champions Before the 2006 season, Beaver Stadium was updated and seasons of note were honored by being listed in front of the suite façade.[58] The following seasons are highlighted; Penn State has earned invitations to 53 bowl games. The Nittany Lions have compiled a bowl record of 31–20–2 (.604), including a 17–7–1 (.700) record in the major bowls (Rose, Orange, Sugar, Fiesta, and Cotton).[59] Coach Joe Paterno was responsible for most of these bids and victories, compiling more appearances (37) than any other coach in college football en route to his bowl record of 24–12–1 (.662). Paterno also has a record of 14–5 (.737) in \"major\" bowls and is the only coach to have won all five major college bowls during his career. James Franklin is the head coach of Penn State since the 2014 season.[60] Penn State and Maryland met in briefly interrupted stretches between 1917 and 1993, with a near-consecutive run played all but three years (1976, 1981, and 1983) between 1960 and 1993. However, the one-sided record belies what was often a competitive matchup until its final years. While Maryland only compiled one win and one tie, numerous games were narrowly lost by missed field goals and turnovers. In 1975, a field goal attempt by kicker Mike Sochko hit the upright with under a minute left, and Maryland lost 15–13. Ten years later, the Terps missed three field goals to eventually lose 20–18. After the Nittany Lions' move to the Big Ten Conference in 1993, the series was canceled. However, Maryland ended up joining the Big Ten as well, in 2014, reinstating the rivalry after more than 2 decades of being dormant. Maryland would win the first matchup by a point (20–19) after infamously declining to shake hands with Penn State captains at midfield during the coin toss at Beaver Stadium. The second meeting as conference foes would be played in Baltimore at M&T Bank Stadium and would again be decided by a point, this time a Penn State win 31–30. The last four matchups (2016–2019), all victories for Penn State have seen the Nittany Lions outscore the Terrapins by a combined score of 201–20 (38–14, 66–3, 38–3, 59–0). The latest match up was played on November 30, 2024, at Beaver Stadium, with Penn State winning 44–7. Penn State leads the series 44–3–1 through the 2024 season.[61] Prior to 1993, Penn State had never played against Michigan, but since then many of the games have been competitive duels with shots at a Big Ten title at stake, and subsequently a national championship. Michigan leads the series, 17–10.[62] Since 1993, Penn State has played Michigan State for the Land Grant Trophy. Penn State holds possession of the trophy after winning the 2023 contest. Penn State leads the series, 19–18–1 as of 2024.[63] When Penn State joined the Big Ten in 1993, Minnesota was the first conference opponent they played. To commemorate this, the governors of both states commissioned a trophy called the Governor's Victory Bell to landmark this event. Since then, the trophy has traveled hands between the winners of each contest. Penn State leads the series, 11–6.[64] The rivalry began before Penn State was a member of the Big Ten. Penn State won the first four meetings of the series, which were held between 1912 and 1964. Then Ohio State won in 1975 in a game held in Columbus, Ohio and again in 1976 during the first ever matchup between the two teams in State College, Pennsylvania. Penn State and Ohio State would meet again in 1980 in their first and only postseason bowl, the 1980 Fiesta Bowl, which Penn State won. After the Fiesta Bowl, the two teams would not meet again until Penn State joined the Big Ten in 1993. Since then, the Nittany Lions and Buckeyes have played each other annually. Ohio State leads the series 25–14 through the 2024 season.[65] This is a long-standing series between in-state rivals Penn State and Pittsburgh. The rivalry, once one of the fiercest and most important in college football north of the Mason–Dixon line, began on November 6, 1893, at the inaugural game of Beaver Field in State College, and Penn State won the contest 32–0.[66] The first two decades of the series was dominated by Penn State taking 12 of 15 matchups between 1893 and 1912. From 1913 to 1949 Pitt would hold a 26–6–2 advantage, before Rip Engle took over as head coach for Penn State in 1950. With Joe Paterno as an assistant coach, Engle led Penn State to a 9–6–1 record against the Panthers from 1950 to 1965. When Paterno was named head coach in 1965, the next 31 games would swing heavily in the Nittany Lion's favor, holding a 23–7–1 advantage from 1966 to 2000.[67] The rivalry went on a 15-year hiatus prior to the scheduling of a 4-game series in 2011[68] that would see Penn State travel to Pittsburgh in 2016 & 2018 with Pitt returning to Happy Valley in 2017 & 2019. The series was branded the Keystone Classic in 2016,[69] which saw Pitt hold on for a thrilling 42–39[70] victory fending off a fierce fourth quarter comeback that fell short on an interception late in the 4th quarter.[71] The Nittany Lions would take the final three games, winning 33–14 in 2017, 51–6 in 2018, and most recently 17–10[72] in Beaver Stadium in 2019.[73] There are no future games scheduled between the two schools, although there is talk of a potential neutral site matchup sometime in the future.[74] The Nittany Lions and Panthers have met on the football field 100 times. Penn State holds a 10-win advantage in the series, 53–43–4, through the 2024 season.[75] The rivalry started in 1922, when Syracuse fought Penn State to a scoreless tie. But it was during the 1950s and 1960s that the rivalry intensified, as it enjoyed a competitive and often controversial string of contests. Syracuse football was led by Ben Schwartzwalder, and Penn State by Rip Engle, then Joe Paterno. From 1950 to 1970, Syracuse won 11 games to Penn State's 10. After Schwartzwalder retired in 1973, Syracuse floundered. Penn State won 16 straight from 1971 to 1986. Conference realignment and scheduling disagreements also dampened the intensity of the rivalry. Penn State fans and players increasingly turned their attention to the rivalry with Pittsburgh. In 1987, Coach Dick MacPherson finally led Syracuse to a resounding 48–21 victory over the Nittany Lions in the Carrier Dome. Syracuse won again the following year in Happy Valley but lost the last two games before the series was suspended in 1991. The rivalry has since been renewed three times since the series suspension — in 2008, 2009, and 2013. The Nittany Lions won all three of these contests. Penn State leads the series 43–23–5 with the most recent game played in 2013. Next meeting between the two teams is scheduled for September 4, 2027.[76] Penn State and West Virginia have played each other 59 times. The first game was in 1904 when Penn State won that game 34–0. In their most recent encounter on August 31, 2024, Penn State won 34–12 in Morgantown. This series has been dominated by the Nittany Lions who lead the series 50–9–2.[77] Though the Crimson Tide are not as much of a traditional opponent for the Nittany Lions, the two teams are still often considered among the best in the country, claim a combined 20 national titles (of which 18 belong to Alabama), and have met in a bowl game three times. The series began on December 19, 1959, in that year's edition of the Liberty Bowl, a 7–0 win for No. 12 Penn State. Sixteen years later, the Nittany Lions and Crimson Tide met in the 1975 Sugar Bowl, resulting in a 13–6 Tide victory in New Orleans. Perhaps the most notable game between these two teams came four years later, in a 1979 Sugar Bowl rematch, resulting in another Alabama victory. The rivalry was intensified during the 1980s, when the Lions and Tide met in 10 consecutive seasons, all during regular season play. After this time, the rivalry went dormant for two decades before being renewed for a 2-game home-and-home series in 2010 and 2011. Alabama leads the series 10–5 with the last game played in 2011.[78] This White Out tradition dates back to a student section white out in 2004 (against Purdue) and has become one of the most eagerly anticipated games during the football season. In recent years, Penn State students have donned white clothes, paint - anything white - to show their solidarity and support for the Nittany Lions. Forming a mass of bouncing and infectious enthusiasm, the students have \"Whited Out\" Beaver Stadium, the Bryce Jordan Center and other sports venues, making them some of the noisiest and most intimidating stadiums in America.[79] Beano Cook of ESPN says, \"If you aren't impressed with the White Out, you're probably one of those people who think the moon landing was faked.\"[80] Originally named \"Paternoville\", Nittanyville is a student camp out that occurs every week of a Penn State home football game. The students camp out to support the team and to acquire the best possible seats for the weekend's upcoming game, since seating is first-come, first serve for students. While the name \"Paternoville\" came about during Penn State's 2005 football season, students have long camped out for first row seats. Prior to 1993, the university distributed non-seat-specific tickets. Starting the same year Penn State football began competition in the Big Ten Conference, students were assigned seats on a first-come-first-serve basis, so that the first students to pass through \"Gate A\" at the south-east corner of the stadium would be assigned first row seats, and so on down the line.[81] Since then, students have camped out in small to massive numbers in order to guarantee themselves a front row seat to a Penn State home football game. The 2005 season saw the naming of the tent-city. In anticipation of the 2005 contest between No. 16 Penn State and No. 6 Ohio State, students began camping six days in advance of the game outside the gate so that they would get a first row seat for, arguably, the biggest game of the 2005 season for Penn State. On Tuesday of the week preceding the game, \"Paternoville\" first appeared. Credited with the naming, freshman Dan Clark and the other students camping with him created a banner reading \"Paternoville\".[82] The name stuck, and on Wednesday morning, October 5, 2005, newspapers were already referring to the campsite as \"Paternoville\". State-wide, regional, and even national media outlets began paying attention to the show in front of Gate A. Local businesses printed t-shirts up for the students, brought truckloads of food, and distributed various things like magazines and small footballs to keep the students occupied. Throughout the week, players, coaches, and many alumni and media personalities paid visits to Paternoville.[83] On Friday, ESPN's \"Cold Pizza\" morning show was broadcast from in front of the Bryce Jordan Center, across from the stadium, with some of the cast walking through Paternoville interviewing students and taping their activities, despite the constant drizzle. The next day, ESPN's College Gameday also was broadcast in front of the Bryce Jordan Center, hours before the showdown between the cross-border rivals.[84] Before noon, the tents were packed away and hundreds of students began to line up for entry into the stadium. That night, in a historic game, the Nittany Lions upset the No. 6 ranked Buckeyes 17–10 in front of a crowd of almost 110,000. The game being decided on a fumble by Ohio State quarterback and future Heisman Trophy winner Troy Smith, caused by Penn State defensive end Tamba Hali and recovered by defensive tackle Scott Paxson. After the final whistle, the students rushed the field.[85] The Paternoville name continued after the game. Since the original \"Paternoville\", two other games have garnered comparable camp-outs. They were the 2005 game against the University of Wisconsin Badgers, which was Senior Day for the 2005 season,[86] and the 2006 contest against University of Michigan Wolverines. However, students camp out for every game, not solely the \"big\" games. On average, about 10–15 tents appear for every game, while the number of tents for the 2005 Ohio State and Wisconsin games and the 2006 Michigan game exceeded 100.[87] Prior to the 2006 season, the university placed several markers around Beaver Stadium commemorating various traditions related to Penn State football. To the left of Gate A there is a marker for the Penn State \"student section\" and to the right of the gate there is a marker for \"Paternoville\".[88] Since 2006, the practice of camping out has grown every year until 2009, when over 2,000 different students camped out for one or multiple games throughout the season. In 2011, the record was broken because of Penn State's high-powered home schedule, which included SEC powerhouse Alabama and new in-conference foe Nebraska, amongst other teams.[89] In the summer of 2012, \"Paternoville\" officially became \"Nittanyville\". As Coach Paterno was no longer the coach of Penn State's football team, the organization decided that since it was unlikely another coach would stay as long as Coach Paterno had, changing the name for each new coach would be impractical. However, aside from the name, nothing was changed and students continued to support the team and camp out for the primary seats.[90] Joe Paterno was widely known for his \"grand experiment\" in which he challenged his players to be successful both on the field and in the classroom.[91] In 2011, the Nittany Lion football team posted an 87% graduation rate, tied with Stanford for No. 10 overall among the nation's 120 Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) institutions, above the national average of 67%.[92] The June 2012 conviction of former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky on multiple counts of child sexual abuse marred the \"Success with Honor\" image.[93] President Rodney Erickson, athletics director Dave Joyner, and head football coach Bill O'Brien, all of whom accepted their jobs in the wake of the scandal, have made statements in which they express commitment to maintaining integrity at the university and within the athletics programs.[94] In 2012, a group of alumni and supporters established a non-profit organization [501(c)(3) and registered trademark] that will build upon the \"Success with Honor\" motto. Their mission is to promote and support charitable endeavors as well as to inspire others to \"Get in the Game.\" Success with Honor is a Social Network Community that has identified more than 60+ charities. Success with Honor helps individuals to identify and connect with causes they would like to volunteer their skills, time, and/or money to. Similarly, SWH assists charities in finding individuals to meet their current needs.[95] The team is widely noted for their simple game uniforms. They only wear white pants, and the jerseys are simple blue for home games, and white for away games.[96] The team is only allowed to wear simple black Nike shoes with white calf socks for game days, though blue tights are permitted underneath the white socks for cold weather games. The helmet is white with a blue stripe down the center, and a blue on white \"Penn State\" sticker covers up the forehead helmet logo. No team logos, conference logos, numbers, or other stickers are permitted on the helmet, though two Nike logos are on facemask visors that some players choose to wear. Penn State has started to wear bowl decals only starting with 1997 Fiesta Bowl. Before that, Penn State always declined the decals so they can play out of their simple game uniforms. The blue and white uniforms replaced the school's original colors, pink and black, in 1890 after a student referendum. A common legend of the color change is that the original colors faded in the sun. Black became a hue of navy blue and the pink became such a light hue that it appeared white. The historicity of this, however, is very questionable, as evidence of it being the root cause is scarce.[97] The uniforms became even simpler for the 2011 season, as the white cuffs and collars on the home jerseys and the corresponding blue cuffs and collars on the road jerseys were eliminated, leaving the jerseys solid blue and white, respectively. In 2012 Penn State started wearing names on their uniforms for the first time as a way to note the players who stuck with the school through the scandal and a blue ribbon in support the victims of child abuse.[98] In 2013, the Nittany Lion logo was added to the base of the jersey collar along with the Big Ten logo on the right side of the jersey. Starting in 2015, the names that were added throughout the 2012–14 seasons to honor those who stayed with the program were removed and the team reverted to the traditional nameless jerseys while still retaining the Nittany Lion logo at the base of the jersey collar. The team also began sporting new Nike Elite 51 jerseys which feature a new design on the collars.[99] In addition, the team added the words \"Nittany Lions\" onto the back of the football helmets. For the 2017 homecoming game against the Indiana Hoosiers, Penn State broke tradition by donning throwback jerseys in what was dubbed the \"Generations of Greatness\" game. These uniforms integrated elements from past uniforms, including: numbers on helmets' sides, block uniform numbers, white stripes on sleeves, blue stripes on pants, striped socks, gray facemasks, white cleats, and a few other subtle changes.[100] Captains are chosen by the team, with the head coach's approval. Being named a captain is an honor almost always given to a senior, but there are some notable exceptions: Linebacker Sean Lee was named a captain in the beginning of Spring practice in 2008, the beginning of his 4th year with the team. However, he suffered a torn ACL during spring practice, redshirted in 2008, and returned as a captain again in 2009. The most recent example of a \"true\" junior being named was Paul Posluszny, who was named a captain in both 2005 and 2006, his junior and senior years, respectively. The last time a junior was named captain before Posluszny was in 1968, when Steve Smear and Mike Reid were named captains during their junior years.[101] In 2014, Christian Hackenberg became the first true sophomore to be named team captain.[102] Penn State is referred to as Linebacker U for its reputation of producing outstanding linebackers.[103][better source needed] The scandal centered on then retired Penn State football assistant coach Jerry Sandusky's sexual assault of two underage boys on or near university property. After a grand jury investigation, Sandusky was indicted on 52 counts of child molestation dating from 1994.[110] The trial started on June 11, 2012, at the Centre County Courthouse in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania,[111][112] and ended on June 22, when the jury found Sandusky guilty on 45 counts.[113][114] On October 9, 2012, Sandusky was sentenced to 30–60 years in prison.[115] Several high-level school officials were charged with perjury,[116] suspended, or dismissed for allegedly covering up the incidents or failing to notify authorities. School president Graham Spanier was forced to resign, and head football coach Joe Paterno was fired without cause late in the season, while Sandusky maintained his innocence.[117] Former FBI director Louis Freeh, whose firm was hired by the Penn State Board of Trustees to conduct an investigation, concluded, after ostensibly conducting 400 interviews and reviewing 3.5 million documents, that Paterno, Spanier, Curley and Schultz had \"repeatedly concealed critical facts relating to Sandusky's abuse from the authorities, the Board of Trustees, Penn State community, and the public at large.\"[118][119][120] In an interview on 60 Minutes Sports, the former Chief Deputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania, Frank Fina, who investigated and prosecuted Sandusky, stated he found no evidence that Paterno participated in a cover-up.[121] In July 2012, NCAA announced it had fined the Penn State football program $60 million, levied a 4-year ban from bowl games and vacated all the program's 112 wins from 1998 to 2011. The program was originally scheduled to lose 10 scholarships from incoming classes in 2013–16, which would have been a loss of 40 scholarships.[122] In September 2013, the NCAA announced they were restoring 25 of the 40 scholarships to Penn State \"[d]ue to Penn State University's continued progress toward ensuring athletics integrity\". After losing 10 scholarships from the 2013–2014 incoming class and only having 75 total players on scholarship, Penn State gained five scholarships back for 2014–15, bringing in 20 new players with 80 total on scholarship. Full scholarships were regained for 2016–17. In total they lost only 15 scholarships.[123] The decision to return the scholarships was by the executive committee of the NCAA following a recommendation from former US Sen. George Mitchell. The NCAA had appointed Mitchell to monitor progress of Penn State's reforms to enhance their \"security, ethics, governance and compliance structure\". The decision was based upon the belief the restored scholarships would provide benefits to student-athletes.[124] Lawsuits were filed against NCAA related to the levy of penalties. In 2014 the NCAA, under the auspices of favorable reports from Mitchell, announced that Penn State would be eligible for the 2014 postseason and all scholarships restored in 2015.[125] The team's wins and records that had been vacated were restored, pending full approval, as part of a legal settlement in 2015.[126][127] Penn State is one of 11 schools with five or more inductees in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[144] Including former head coach Joe Paterno, 26 Nittany Lion players and coaches have been selected for the College Football Hall of Fame.[145] [146][147]",

He was part of two national championships as a backup in 2021 and 2022. Beck was born on November 19, 2002, in Jacksonville, Florida.[1] He attended Mandarin High School and was named the 2018 Florida Mr. Football after throwing for 3,546 yards and 30 touchdowns as a junior.[2][3] Beck led Mandarin to a Florida State Championship, throwing for five touchdowns in the championship game.[4] As a senior, he recorded 1,843 yards and 20 touchdowns on 278 completions.[2] As a sophomore he committed to play baseball at Florida, before deciding to focus on football, committing to Alabama for the sport.[5] Beck would ultimately decommit from Alabama and commit to play college football at the University of Georgia.[6] As a freshman, Beck entered the season as the backup in a quarterback room including Stetson Bennett, JT Daniels, and D'Wan Mathis. Beck made his first appearance against Missouri in the fourth quarter. The following season, Beck threw his first career touchdown pass in a 56–7 victory over UAB.[7] Beck played in three games, throwing for 176 yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions.[8] Beck entered the 2022 season as the second-string quarterback, serving as the backup for Bennett. He appeared in the first three games of the season totaling 178 yards and two touchdowns.[9] Against Vanderbilt, Beck would tally two touchdowns and 98 yards.[10] Entering the 2023 season, Beck was named the week one starter against UT Martin.[11][12][13] In his first game as a starter, he threw for 294 yards and a touchdown, adding another touchdown rushing in a 48–7 victory.[14][15] The following week against Ball State, Beck tallied 283 yards and two touchdowns, leading Georgia to a 45–3 win.[16] In his first career SEC start, he threw for 269 yards leading Georgia to a 24–14 come-from-behind victory against South Carolina.[17] The next week against UAB, Beck threw for a then career-high 337 yards and combined for four total touchdowns, three passing and one rushing, in a 49–21 triumph.[18][19] Against Auburn the following week, Beck made his first career road start, throwing for 313 yards and the go-ahead touchdown, a 40-yard pass to Brock Bowers, leading Georgia to a 27–20 win.[20] In his first career start against a ranked opponent, he threw for 389 yards and four touchdowns in a 51–13 rout of No. 20 Kentucky.[21] As a result of his performance, he was named the co-SEC offensive player of the week.[22][23] Against Florida, Beck threw for 315 yards and two touchdowns in a 43–20 win.[24][25][26] Against No. 12 Missouri the following week, Beck recorded 21 completions for 254 yards and two touchdowns, resulting in a 30–21 victory.[27] During the 2023 regular season, Beck led Georgia to a 12–1 record, finishing the year with 22 passing touchdowns and 3,738 passing yards.[28] In the 2023 Orange Bowl, he threw for 203 yards and two touchdowns, helping lead Georgia to the largest margin of victory in any bowl game at the FBS level with a 63–3 rout of Florida State.[29] Following the conclusion of the season, Beck announced that he would return the following season rather than enter the 2024 NFL draft.[30][31][32] Beck finished the 2023 season throwing for 3,941 yards and recording 28 total touchdowns.[33] Entering the 2024 season, Beck emerged as one of the top overall prospects in the upcoming 2025 NFL draft.[34][35] In the season opener against No. 14 Clemson, he threw for 278 yards and two touchdowns, leading Georgia to a 34–3 victory.[36][37] For his performance, he was named the co-SEC offensive player of the week.[38][39] The following week against Tennessee Tech, he threw five touchdown passes, tying the school record for single-game passing touchdowns.[40] Against No. 4 Alabama, Beck threw for 439 yards and three touchdowns, while also throwing three interceptions, in a 41–34 defeat.[41] Against Mississippi State, Beck threw for a career-high 459 yards and three touchdowns in a 41–31 victory.[42] Against No. 7 Tennessee, he threw for 347 yards and two touchdowns, in addition to rushing for 32 yards and a touchdown in a 31–17 win.[43] Against Georgia Tech in Beck's final Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate game, he threw for 297 yards and five touchdowns, leading Georgia to a 44–42 comeback victory in eight overtimes.[44] In the 2024 SEC Championship Game against No. 2 Texas, he sustained a shoulder injury on the final play of the first half, being ruled out for the rest of the game.[45] Georgia went on to win the game by a score of 22–19 in overtime, in the absence of Beck.[46] After the game, he underwent an MRI, revealing a UCL injury in his elbow.[47] After not being able to practice with the team, Beck was ruled out for Georgia's first College Football Playoff game in the 2025 Sugar Bowl.[48][49] On December 23, 2024, it was announced that Beck underwent surgery on his right elbow, performed by Neal ElAttrache, prematurely ending his season.[50] On December 28, he declared for the 2025 NFL draft.[51] However, on January 9, 2025, Beck instead opted to enter the transfer portal rather than enter the draft.[52][53] During the 2024 regular season, Beck led Georgia to a 11–2 record, including an SEC Championship. He finished the season passing for 3,485 yards and 28 touchdowns with 12 interceptions.[54] Beck is a Christian.[55] Beck is in a relationship with Miami Hurricanes basketball player and social media influencer Hanna Cavinder.[56] In 2024, he purchased a Lamborghini Urus Performante, which brought widespread attention to Beck and the state of collegiate athletics following the implementation of name, image, and likeness (NIL).[57][58][59]",

The Bulldogs didn’t need Beck to win the conference, dispatching the Longhorns 22-19, but Gunner Stockton couldn’t lead UGA past Notre Dame in the College Football Playoff. CBS Sports’ David Cobb acknowledged that it won’t affect the Bulldogs much since Stockton held his own in the aforementioned postseason performances enough to take the reins in Athens. Cobb also proposed Georgia find upperclassmen competition for Stockton in the QB room. “The news has little impact on Georgia, which was already preparing for life without Beck. Stockton proved in the Sugar Bowl that he could be a serviceable option and is the frontrunner to start for now, especially after Jaden Rashada's decision to transfer. Former four-star prospects Ryan Puglisi from the Class of 2024 and Ryan Montgomery from the Class of 2025 will be promising but inexperienced options on next year's roster, meaning the Bulldogs could benefit from adding an experienced QB to compete with Stockton,” Cobb wrote. Beck could be hedging his 2025 NFL declaration in December with this move. It may work out if Mike Bobo could be proven as the problem for Beck’s development. Bobo didn’t get the most out of Bo Nix at Auburn and oversaw Beck’s regression from 2023 to 2024. It should be noted that Beck entering the portal doesn’t automatically mean he will leave Georgia. It could be an NIL dispute that ends up getting resolved for all we know. Beck has NFL millions on the line. Repairing his image could get him back into first-round consideration. If Bobo is the problem, and Kirby Smart isn’t too keen on solving it, Beck is doing what’s best for his career entering the portal and finding a new home.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Almost a year ago today, Miami pulled off the shocker of the 2023-24 transfer cycle: It convinced Cam Ward to exit the NFL Draft and come back to college for his redshirt senior season. It worked out brilliantly. Ward entered that draft process considered a Day 3 draft pick by many NFL scouts. He exited as a Heisman Trophy finalist and in the mix to be QB1 in the 2025 NFL Draft. That seems to be the path Georgia quarterback Carson Beck is hoping to traverse, too. Beck is expected to enter the transfer portal, injecting a shot of adrenaline into a quarterback market that had largely stalled following a flurry of December moves. Many draft pundits considered Beck a first-round draft pick heading into the 2024 campaign. But an up-and-down senior season -- during which he threw a SEC-high 12 interceptions -- and a right elbow injury that will keep him out through the early part of 2025 put a damper on his draft stock. So much so that CBS Sports ranks Beck as its No. 55 overall prospect for the 2025 NFL Draft, which would put him in danger of even slipping into Round 3. By returning to college -- and it's important to note Beck never signed a standard representation agreement with a NFL agent, which allows him to come back to school -- Beck can repair his once sky-high draft stock. Though, the 2026 NFL Draft pool looks far more potentially competitive with names like Nico Iamaleava, Arch Manning and Drew Allar looming. As for where Beck may turn next, the obvious candidate is Miami, so much so it's fair to term the Hurricanes as an early favorite in this process; Beck is yet to officially appear in the NCAA's portal database and schools are barred from directly communicating with him until he does so. Miami has aggressively pursued quarterbacks behind the scenes since its bowl game, multiple sources tell CBS Sports, when potential 2025 starter Emory Williams struggled in a 5-for-14, 26-yard, one-interception performance after relieving Ward at halftime of the Pop-Tarts Bowl. The Hurricanes swung and missed on a few targets, but Beck would represent almost a best possible case scenario for them if they were to close the deal. Beck brings a similar level of upside to Ward, and he's already a producer on the biggest stages. Given Miami's aggressiveness with name, image and likeness deals (aka collective money), it's fairly easy to connect the dots between the two sides, especially when you consider Beck will likely require a ground-breaking NIL deal in the portal, perhaps upward of the $4 million Darrian Mensah commanded from Duke. For a little context, Tennessee's Hendon Hooker is the last quarterback to be drafted between pick 40 and 70 dating back to the 2023 NFL Draft. His initial contract was for four years, $5.7 million. Beck might approach that dollar figure in 2025 alone by returning to college. Obviously, Beck will have other suitors in the portal beyond Miami. Perhaps Ohio State chooses to get in the mix and add a veteran presence. Maybe North Carolina makes a run after missing on John Mateer early in the cycle. But, at least for now, Miami is the expected early frontrunner to land Beck. It's a bit of déjà vu in the ever churning entity that is the transfer portal. Even those who publicly declare for the NFL Draft aren't safe from being sucked into the portal and spit out again in a different college uniform. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Georgia quarterback Carson Beck has entered the transfer portal after previously declaring for the NFL Draft, sources confirmed to 247Sports' Matt Zenitz. Beck, who has one season of eligibility remaining, spent the past five seasons with the Bulldogs and will immediately become one of the headline players of the 2025 transfer class. Beck passed for 7,912 yards with 58 touchdowns and 20 interceptions during his time with the Bulldogs. He was a two-year starter for the program and entered the 2024 season regarded as a potential No. 1 overall selection in the 2025 NFL Draft. However, Beck struggled with turnovers during the 2024 season and then suffered an injury to his right elbow on the final play before halftime of the SEC Championship Game win over Texas. Following UCL surgery, Beck was ruled out for the College Football Playoff. As a result, the Bulldogs turned to backup Gunner Stockton, who performed well in the team's Sugar Bowl quarterfinal loss to Notre Dame. Beck was the No. 55 overall player and No. 5 quarterback in the 2025 CBS Sports NFL Draft Prospect Rankings as of Thursday. A strong 2025 season could help boost his draft stock back into first-round territory in 2026. In the meantime, he stands to land a lucrative NIL deal that could be competitive with the rookie salary for a second-round NFL Draft pick. The news has little impact on Georgia, which was already preparing for life without Beck. Stockton proved in the Sugar Bowl that he could be a serviceable option and is the frontrunner to start for now, especially after Jaden Rashada's decision to transfer.

                "content": "Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama[1] (née Robinson; born January 17, 1964) is an American attorney and author who served as the first lady of the United States from 2009 to 2017, being married to Barack Obama, the 44th president of the United States. Raised on the South Side of Chicago, Obama is a graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Law School. In her early legal career, she worked at the law firm Sidley Austin where she met her future husband. She subsequently worked in nonprofits and as the associate dean of Student Services at the University of Chicago. Later, she served as vice president for community and external affairs of the University of Chicago Medical Center. Michelle married Barack in 1992, and they have two daughters. Obama campaigned for her husband's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. She was the first African-American woman to serve as first lady. As first lady, Obama worked as an advocate for poverty awareness, education, nutrition, physical activity, and healthy eating. She has written three books including her The New York Times best selling memoir Becoming (2018) and The Light We Carry (2022). Michelle LaVaughn Robinson was born on January 17, 1964, in Chicago, Illinois, to Fraser Robinson III (1935–1991),[2] a city water plant employee and Democratic precinct captain, and Marian Shields Robinson (1937–2024), a secretary at Spiegel's catalog store.[3] Her mother was a full-time homemaker until Michelle entered high school.[4] The Robinson and Shields families trace their roots to pre-Civil War African Americans in the American South.[2] On her father's side, she is descended from the Gullah people of South Carolina's Lowcountry region.[5] Her paternal great-great-grandfather, Jim Robinson, was born into slavery in 1850 on Friendfield Plantation, near Georgetown, South Carolina.[6][7] He became a freedman at age 15 after the war. Some of Obama's paternal family still reside in the Georgetown area.[8][9] Her grandfather, Fraser Robinson Jr., built his own house in South Carolina. He and his wife LaVaughn (née Johnson) returned to the Lowcountry from Chicago after retirement.[6] Among her maternal ancestors was her great-great-great-grandmother, Melvinia Dosey Shields,[10] born into slavery in South Carolina but sold to Henry Walls Shields, who had a 200-acre farm in Clayton County, Georgia, near Atlanta. Melvinia's first son, Adolphus T. Shields, was biracial and born into slavery around 1860. Based on DNA and other evidence, in 2012, researchers said his father was likely 20-year-old Charles Marion Shields, son of Melvinia's master. They may have had a continuing relationship, as she had two more mixed-race children and lived near Shields after emancipation, taking his surname (she later changed her surname).[11] As was often the case, Melvinia did not talk to relatives about Dolphus's father.[12] Dolphus Shields, with his wife Alice, moved to Birmingham, Alabama, after the Civil War. They were great-great-grandparents of Robinson, whose grandparents had moved to Chicago.[12] Other of their children's lines migrated to Cleveland, Ohio, in the 20th century.[11] All four of Robinson's grandparents had multiracial ancestors, reflecting the complex history of the United States. Her extended family has said that people did not talk about the era of slavery when they were growing up.[11] Her distant ancestry includes Irish, English, and Native American roots.[13] Among her contemporary extended family is Rabbi Capers Funnye, her first cousin once removed born in Georgetown, South Carolina. Funnye is the son of her paternal grandfather's sister and her husband, and he is about 12 years older than Michelle. He converted to Judaism after college.[14][15] Robinson's childhood home was on the upper floor of 7436 South Euclid Avenue in Chicago's South Shore community area, which her parents rented from her great-aunt, who had the first floor.[3][16][17][18] She was raised in what she describes as a \"conventional\" home, with \"the mother at home, the father works, you have dinner around the table\".[19] Her elementary school was down the street. She and her family enjoyed playing games such as Monopoly, reading, and frequently saw extended family on both sides.[20] She played piano,[21] learning from her great-aunt, who was a piano teacher.[22] The Robinsons attended services at nearby South Shore United Methodist Church.[16] They used to vacation in a rustic cabin in White Cloud, Michigan.[16] She and her 21-month-older brother, Craig, skipped the second grade.[3][23] Robinson's father suffered from multiple sclerosis, which had a profound effect on her. Subsequently, she was determined to stay out of trouble and perform well in school.[24] By sixth grade, Michelle joined a gifted class at Bryn Mawr Elementary School (later renamed Bouchet Academy).[25] She attended Whitney Young High School,[26] Chicago's first magnet high school, established as a selective enrollment school, where she was a classmate of Jesse Jackson's daughter Santita.[20] The round-trip commute from the Robinsons' South Side home to the Near West Side, where the school was located, took three hours.[27] Michelle recalled being fearful of how others would perceive her, but disregarded any negativity around her and used it \"to fuel me, to keep me going\".[28][29] She recalled facing gender discrimination growing up, saying, for example, that rather than asking her for her opinion on a given subject, people commonly tended to ask what her older brother thought.[30] She was on the honor roll for four years, took advanced placement classes, was a member of the National Honor Society, and served as student council treasurer.[3] She graduated in 1981 as the salutatorian of her class.[27] Robinson was inspired to follow her brother to Princeton University, which she entered in 1981.[31][4] She majored in sociology and minored in African-American studies, graduating cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in 1985 after completing a 99-page senior thesis titled Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community under the supervision of Walter Wallace.[32][3][33] Robinson recalls that some of her teachers in high school tried to dissuade her from applying, and that she had been warned against \"setting my sights too high\".[34][35] She believed her brother's status as a student in good standing (he graduated in 1983) might have helped her during the admission process,[36] but she was resolved to demonstrate her own worth.[37] She has said she was overwhelmed during her first year, attributing this to the fact that neither of her parents had graduated from college,[38] and that she had never spent time on a college campus.[39] The mother of a white roommate reportedly tried to get her daughter reassigned because of Michelle's race.[31] Robinson said being at Princeton was the first time she became more aware of her ethnicity and, despite the willingness of her classmates and teachers to reach out to her, she still felt \"like a visitor on campus\".[40][41] There were also issues of economic class. \"I remember being shocked,\" she says, \"by college students who drove BMWs. I didn't even know parents who drove BMWs.\"[27] While at Princeton, Robinson became involved with the Third World Center (now known as the Carl A. Fields Center), an academic and cultural group who supported minority students. She ran their daycare center, which also offered after-school tutoring for older children.[42] She challenged the teaching methodology for French because she felt it should be more conversational.[43] As part of her requirements for graduation, she wrote a sociology thesis, entitled Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community.[44][45] She researched her thesis by sending a questionnaire to African-American graduates, asking that they specify when and how comfortable they were with their race prior to their enrollment at Princeton and how they felt about it when they were a student and since then. Of the 400 alumni to whom she sent the survey, fewer than 90 responded. Her findings did not support her hope that the black alumni would still identify with the African-American community, even though they had attended an elite university and had the advantages that accrue to its graduates.[46] Robinson pursued professional study, earning her Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from Harvard Law School in 1988.[47] By the time she applied for Harvard Law, biographer Bond wrote, her confidence had increased: \"This time around, there was no doubt in her mind that she had earned her place\".[46] Her faculty mentor at Harvard Law was Charles Ogletree, who has said she had answered the question that had plagued her throughout Princeton by the time she arrived at Harvard Law: whether she would remain the product of her parents or keep the identity she had acquired at Princeton; she had concluded she could be \"both brilliant and black\".[48] At Harvard, Robinson participated in demonstrations advocating the hiring of professors who were members of minority groups.[49] She worked for the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, assisting low-income tenants with housing cases.[50] She is the third first lady with a postgraduate degree, after her two immediate predecessors, Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush.[51] She later said her education gave her opportunities beyond what she had ever imagined.[52] Michelle's mother, Marian Robinson, was a stay-at-home mother.[53] Her father was Fraser C. Robinson III, who worked at the city's water purification plant.[53] Robinson's father, Fraser, died from complications from his illness in March 1991.[54] She would later say that although he was the \"hole in my heart\" and \"loss in my scar\", the memory of her father has motivated her each day since.[39] Her friend Suzanne Alele died from cancer around this time as well. These losses made her think of her contributions toward society and how well she was influencing the world from her law firm in her first job after law school. She considered this a turning point.[55] Robinson met Barack Obama when they were among the few African Americans at their law firm, Sidley Austin LLP (she has sometimes said only two, although others have noted that there were others in different departments).[56] She was assigned to mentor him while he was a summer associate.[57] Their relationship started with a business lunch and then a community organization meeting where he first impressed her.[58] Before meeting Obama, Michelle had told her mother she intended to focus solely on her career.[59] The couple's first date was to Spike Lee's movie Do the Right Thing (1989).[60] Barack Obama has said the couple had an \"opposites attract\" scenario in their initial interest in each other since Michelle had stability from her two-parent home while he was \"adventurous\".[61] They married on October 3, 1992.[58] After suffering a miscarriage, Michelle underwent in vitro fertilisation[62] to conceive their daughters Malia Ann (born 1998) and Natasha (known as Sasha, born 2001).[63] The Obama family lived on Chicago's South Side, where Barack taught at the University of Chicago Law School. He was elected to the state senate in 1996 and to the U.S. Senate in 2004. They chose to keep their residence in Chicago after Barack's election rather than to move to Washington, DC, as they felt it was better for their daughters. Throughout her husband's 2008 campaign for U.S. president, Obama made a \"commitment to be away overnight only once a week – to campaign only two days a week and be home by the end of the second day\" for their two daughters.[64] She once requested that her then-fiancé meet her prospective boss, Valerie Jarrett, when considering her first career move;[19] Jarrett became one of her husband's closest advisors.[65][66] The marital relationship has had its ebbs and flows; the combination of an evolving family life and beginning political career led to many arguments about balancing work and family. Barack Obama wrote in his second book, The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream, that \"Tired and stressed, we had little time for conversation, much less romance.\"[67] Despite their family obligations and careers, they continued to try to schedule \"date nights\" while they lived in Chicago.[68] The Obamas' daughters attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, a private school.[69] As a member of the school's board, Michelle fought to maintain diversity in the school when other board members connected with the University of Chicago tried to reserve more slots for children of the university faculty. This resulted in a plan to expand the school to increase enrollment.[4] In Washington, DC, Malia and Sasha attended Sidwell Friends School, after also considering Georgetown Day School.[70][71] In 2008, Michelle said in an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that they did not intend to have any more children.[72] The Obamas received advice from past first ladies Laura Bush, Rosalynn Carter, and Hillary Clinton about raising children in the White House.[71] Marian Robinson, Michelle's mother, moved in to the White House to assist with child care.[73] Obama was raised United Methodist and joined the Trinity United Church of Christ, a mostly black congregation of the Reformed denomination known as the United Church of Christ. She and Barack Obama were married there by Rev. Jeremiah Wright. On May 31, 2008, Barack and Michelle Obama announced that they had withdrawn their membership in Trinity United Church of Christ saying: \"Our relations with Trinity have been strained by the divisive statements of Reverend Wright, which sharply conflict with our own views.\"[74] The Obama family attended several different Protestant churches after moving to Washington D.C. in 2009, including Shiloh Baptist Church and St. John's Episcopal Church on Lafayette Square, known as the Presidents' Church. At the 49th African Methodist Episcopal Church's general conference, Michelle Obama encouraged the attendees to advocate for political awareness, saying, \"To anyone who says that church is no place to talk about these issues, you tell them there is no place better – no place better, because ultimately, these are not just political issues – they are moral issues, they're issues that have to do with human dignity and human potential, and the future we want for our kids and our grandkids.\"[75] Following law school, Obama became an associate at the Chicago office of the law firm Sidley & Austin, where she met her future husband Barack. At the firm, she worked on marketing and intellectual property law.[3] She continues to hold her law license, but as she no longer needs it for her work, she has kept it on a voluntary inactive status since 1993.[76][77] In 1991, she held public sector positions in the Chicago city government as an assistant to the mayor and as the assistant commissioner of planning and development. In 1993, she became executive director for the Chicago office of Public Allies, a non-profit organization encouraging young people to work on social issues in nonprofit groups and government agencies.[26] She worked there nearly four years and set fundraising records for the organization that stood twelve years after she had left.[20] Obama later said she had never been happier in her life prior to working \"to build Public Allies\".[78] In 1996, Obama served as the associate dean of student services at the University of Chicago, where she developed the university's Community Service Center.[79] In 2002, she began working for the University of Chicago Hospitals, first as executive director for community affairs and, beginning May 2005, as vice president for community and external affairs.[80] She continued to hold the University of Chicago Hospitals position during the primary campaign of 2008 but cut back to part-time in order to spend time with her daughters as well as work for her husband's election.[81] She subsequently took a leave of absence from her job.[82] According to the couple's 2006 income tax return, her salary was $273,618 from the University of Chicago Hospitals, while her husband had a salary of $157,082 from the United States Senate. The Obamas' total income was $991,296, which included $51,200 that she earned as a member of the board of directors of TreeHouse Foods and investments and royalties from his books.[83] Obama served as a salaried board member of TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (NYSE: THS),[84] a major Wal-Mart supplier from shortly after her husband was seated in the Senate until she cut ties shortly after her husband announced his candidacy for the presidency; he criticized Wal-Mart labor policies at an AFL–CIO forum in Trenton, New Jersey, on May 14, 2007.[85] She also served on the board of directors of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.[86] In 2021, the former first lady announced that she has been \"moving toward retirement\".[87] Though she continues to be active in political campaigns, the former first lady has said she is reducing the amount of work to spend more time with her husband.[87] During an interview in 1996, Michelle Obama acknowledged there was a \"strong possibility\" her husband would begin a political career, but said she was \"wary\" of the process. She knew it meant their lives would be subject to scrutiny and she was intensely private.[88] Although she campaigned on her husband's behalf since early in his political career by handshaking and fund-raising, she did not relish the activity at first. When she campaigned during her husband's 2000 run for United States House of Representatives, her boss at the University of Chicago asked if there was any single thing about campaigning that she enjoyed; after some thought, she replied that visiting so many living rooms had given her some new decorating ideas.[89][90] Obama opposed her husband's run for the congressional seat, and, after his defeat, she preferred he tend to the financial needs of the family in what she deemed a more practical way.[91] At first, Obama had reservations about her husband's presidential campaign, due to fears about a possible negative effect on their daughters.[92] She says that she negotiated an agreement in which her husband was to quit smoking in exchange for her support of his decision to run.[93] About her role in her husband's presidential campaign, she has said: \"My job is not a senior adviser\".[65][94][95] During the campaign, she discussed race and education by using motherhood as a framework.[43] In May 2007, three months after her husband declared his presidential candidacy, Obama reduced her professional responsibilities by 80 percent to support his presidential campaign.[19] Early in the campaign, she had limited involvement, traveling to political events only two days a week and rarely traveling overnight;[96] by early February 2008, her participation had increased significantly. She attended thirty-three events in eight days.[66] She made several campaign appearances with Oprah Winfrey.[97][98] She wrote her own stump speeches for her husband's presidential campaign and generally spoke without notes.[27] During the campaign, columnist Cal Thomas on Fox News described Michelle Obama as an \"Angry Black Woman\"[99][100][101] and some websites attempted to promote this image.[102] Obama said: \"Barack and I have been in the public eye for many years now, and we've developed a thick skin along the way. When you're out campaigning, there will always be criticism. I just take it in stride, and at the end of the day, I know that it comes with the territory.\"[103] By the time of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in August, media outlets observed that her presence on the campaign trail had grown softer than at the start of the race, focusing on soliciting concerns and empathizing with the audience rather than throwing down challenges to them, and giving interviews to shows such as The View and publications like Ladies' Home Journal rather than appearing on news programs. The change was reflected in her fashion choices, as she wore clothes that were more informal clothes than her earlier designer pieces.[89] Partly intended to help soften her public image,[99] her appearance on The View was widely covered in the press.[104] The presidential campaign was Obama's first exposure to the national political scene; she was considered the least famous of the candidates' spouses.[94] Early in the campaign, she told anecdotes about Obama family life; however, as the press began to emphasize her sarcasm, she toned it down.[83][93] New York Times op-ed columnist Maureen Dowd wrote: I wince a bit when Michelle Obama chides her husband as a mere mortal – a comic routine that rests on the presumption that we see him as a god ... But it may not be smart politics to mock him in a way that turns him from the glam JFK into the mundane Gerald Ford, toasting his own English muffin. If all Senator Obama is peddling is the Camelot mystique, why debunk this mystique?[94][105] On the first night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Craig Robinson introduced his younger sister.[106] She delivered her speech, during which she sought to portray herself and her family as the embodiment of the American Dream.[107] Obama said she and her husband believe \"that you work hard for what you want in life, that your word is your bond, and you do what you say you're going to do, that you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you don't know them, and even if you don't agree with them.\"[108] She also emphasized loving her country, likely responding to criticism for having said that she felt \"proud of her country for the first time\".[107][109][110] The first statement was seen as a gaffe.[111] Her keynote address was largely well-received and drew mostly positive reviews.[112] A Rasmussen Reports poll found that her favorability among Americans reached 55%, the highest for her.[113] On an October 6, 2008, broadcast, Larry King asked Obama if the American electorate was past the Bradley effect. She said her husband's winning the nomination was a fairly strong indicator that it was.[114] The same night she was interviewed by Jon Stewart on The Daily Show, where she deflected criticism of her husband and his campaign.[115] On Fox News' America's Pulse, E. D. Hill referred to the fist bump shared by the Obamas the night he clinched the Democratic presidential nomination, describing it as a \"terrorist fist jab\". Hill was taken off air, and the show was canceled.[116][117] Obama campaigned for her husband's re-election in 2012. Beginning in 2011, Obama became more politically active than she had been since the 2008 election, though avoided discussions about the re-election bid.[118] By the time of the election cycle, she had developed a more open public image.[119][120] Some commentators viewed her as the most popular member of the Obama administration,[121] noting that her poll approval numbers had not dropped below 60% since she entered the White House.[122] An Obama senior campaign official said she was \"the most popular political figure in America\".[123] The positive assessment was reasoned to have contributed to her active role in the re-election campaign, but it was noted that the challenge for the Obama campaign was to use her without tarnishing her popularity. Obama was considered a polarizing figure, having aroused both \"sharp enmity and deep loyalty\" from Americans, but she was also seen as having improved her image since 2008 when her husband first ran for the presidency.[121] Isabel Wilkinson of The Daily Beast said Obama's fashion style changed over the course of the campaign to be sensitive and economical.[124] Prior to the first debate of the election cycle, Obama expressed confidence in her husband's debating skills.[125] He was later criticized for appearing detached and for looking down when addressing Romney.[126][127] Consensus among uncommitted voters was that the latter had won the debate.[128] After Obama's speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, the first lady was found through a CBS News/New York Times poll conducted in September to have a 61% favorably rating with registered voters, the highest percentage she had polled since April 2009.[129] Obama aimed to humanize her husband by relating stories about him, attempting to appeal to female voters in swing states. Paul Harris of The Guardian said the same tactic was being used by Ann Romney, wife of 2012 Republican candidate Mitt Romney. Polls in October showed their husbands tied at 47% for the female vote. However, Michelle Obama's favorability ratings remained higher than Ann Romney's at 69% to 52%.[130] Despite Obama's higher poll numbers, comparisons between Obama and Romney were repeatedly made by the media until the election.[131][132] But, as Michelle Cottle of Newsweek wrote, \"... nobody votes for first lady.\"[133] During her early months as First Lady, Obama visited homeless shelters and soup kitchens.[134] She also sent representatives to schools and advocated public service.[134][135] Obama advocated for her husband's policy priorities by promoting bills that support it. She hosted a White House reception for women's rights advocates in celebration of the enactment of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 Pay equity law. She supported the economic stimulus bill in visits to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and United States Department of Education. Some observers looked favorably upon her legislative activities, while others said she should be less involved in politics. According to her representatives, she intended to visit all United States Cabinet-level agencies in order to get acquainted with Washington.[136] On June 5, 2009, the White House announced that Michelle Obama was replacing her then chief of staff, Jackie Norris, with Susan Sher, a longtime friend and adviser. Norris became a senior adviser to the Corporation for National and Community Service.[137] Another key aide, Spelman College alumna Kristen Jarvis, served from 2008 until 2015, when she left to become chief of staff to the Ford Foundation president Darren Walker. In 2009, Obama was named Barbara Walters's Most Fascinating Person of the year.[138] In her memoir, Becoming, Obama describes her four primary initiatives as first lady: Let's Move!, Reach Higher,[139] Let Girls Learn,[140] and Joining Forces.[141] Some initiatives of First Lady Michelle Obama included advocating on behalf of military families, helping working women balance career and family, encouraging national service, and promoting the arts and arts education.[142][143] Obama made supporting military families and spouses a personal mission and increasingly bonded with military families. According to her aides, stories of the sacrifice these families make moved her to tears.[143] In April 2012, Obama and her husband were awarded the Jerald Washington Memorial Founders' Award by the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans (NCHV). The award is the highest honor given to homeless veteran advocates.[144] Obama was again honored with the award in May 2015, accepting with Jill Biden.[145] In November 2013, a Politico article by Michelle Cottle accusing Obama of being a \"feminist nightmare\" for not using her position and education to advocate for women's issues was sharply criticized across the political spectrum.[146][147][148] Cottle quoted Linda Hirshman saying of Obama's trendy styles, promotion of gardening and healthy eating, and support of military families that \"She essentially became the English lady of the manor, Tory Party, circa 1830s.\"[146] A prominent critic of Cottle was MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry, who rhetorically asked \"Are you serious?\"[147][148] Supporters of Obama note that the first lady had been one of the only people in the administration to address obesity, through promoting good eating habits, which is one of the leading U.S. public health crises.[149] In May 2014, Obama joined the campaign to bring back school girls who had been kidnapped in Nigeria. The first lady tweeted a picture of herself holding a poster with the #bringbackourgirls campaign hashtag.[150] Obama writes in her book about enlisting help for her initiative Let Girls Learn to produce and sing the song \"This is for My Girls\".[151] Over the course of the Obama presidency, particularly during the second term, Michelle Obama was subject to speculation over whether she would run for the presidency herself, similarly to predecessor Hillary Clinton.[152] A May 2015 Rasmussen poll found Obama had 22% of support to Clinton's 56% of winning the Democratic nomination, higher than that of potential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Martin O'Malley, and Bernie Sanders.[153][154] Another poll that month found that 71% of Americans believed Obama should not run for the presidency, only 14% approving.[154] On January 14, 2016, during a town-hall meeting, President Obama was asked if the first lady could be talked into running. He responded, \"There are three things that are certain in life: death, taxes, and Michelle is not running for president. That I can tell you.\"[155][156] On March 16, 2016, while speaking in Austin, Texas, Obama denied that she would ever run for the office, citing a desire to \"impact as many people as possible in an unbiased way\".[157] In the epilogue to Becoming, Obama writes, \"I have no intention of running for office, ever,\"[158] recognizing that \"politics can be a means for positive change, but this arena is just not for me.\"[159] Obama's predecessors Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush supported the organic movement by instructing the White House kitchens to buy organic food. Obama extended their support of healthy eating by planting the White House Kitchen Garden, an organic garden, the first White House vegetable garden since Eleanor Roosevelt served as First Lady. She also had bee hives installed on the South Lawn of the White House. The garden supplied organic produce and honey for the meals of the First Family and for state dinners and other official gatherings.[160][161][162][163] In January 2010, Obama undertook her first lead role in an administration-wide initiative, which she named \"Let's Move!\", to make progress in reversing the 21st-century trend of childhood obesity.[162][164] On February 9, 2010, the first lady announced Let's Move! and President Barack Obama created the Task Force on Childhood Obesity to review all current programs and create a national plan for change.[165] Michelle Obama said her goal was to make this effort her legacy: \"I want to leave something behind that we can say, 'Because of this time that this person spent here, this thing has changed.' And my hope is that that's going to be in the area of childhood obesity.\"[162] Her 2012 book American Grown: The Story of the White House Kitchen Garden and Gardens Across America is based on her experiences with the garden and promotes healthy eating.[166] Her call for action on healthy eating was repeated by the United States Department of Defense, which has been facing an ever-expanding problem of obesity among recruits.[167] Several Republicans have critiqued or lampooned Obama's initiative. In October 2014, senator Rand Paul linked to Michelle Obama's Twitter account when announcing on the website that he was going to Dunkin' Donuts.[168] In January 2016, Chris Christie, Republican governor of New Jersey and presidential candidate, criticized the first lady's involvement with healthy eating while he was campaigning in Iowa, arguing that she was using the government to exercise her views on eating.[169][170] Obama had previously cited Christie as an example of an adult who struggled with obesity, a demographic that she sought to diminish by targeting children since Let's Move! was \"working with kids when they're young, so that they don't have these direct challenges when they get older.\"[171] In February, Senator Ted Cruz said that he would end Obama's health policies and return french fries to school cafeterias if his wife were first lady.[172] In the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign, Obama boasted to gay Democratic groups of her husband's record on LGBT rights: his support of the Illinois Human Rights Act, the Illinois gender violence act, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, repealing the \"Don't Ask Don't Tell\" policy, and full repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act, civil unions; along with hate crimes protection for sexual orientation and gender identity and renewed effort to fight HIV and AIDS. They have both opposed amendments proposed to ban same-sex marriage in the federal, California, and Florida constitutions. She said that the U.S. Supreme Court delivered justice in the Lawrence v. Texas case, and she drew a connection between the struggles for gay rights and civil rights by saying, \"We are all only here because of those who marched and bled and died, from Selma to Stonewall, in the pursuit of a more perfect union.\"[173][174][175] After the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell on September 20, 2011, Obama included openly gay service members in her national military families initiative.[176] On May 9, 2012, Barack and Michelle Obama came out publicly in favor of same-sex marriage. Prior to this, Michelle Obama had never publicly stated her position on this issue. Senior White House officials said Michelle Obama and Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett had been the two most consistent advocates for same-sex marriage in Barack Obama's life.[177] Michelle said: This is an important issue for millions of Americans, and for Barack and me, it really comes down to the values of fairness and equality we want to pass down to our girls. These are basic values that kids learn at a very young age and that we encourage them to apply in all areas of their lives. And in a country where we teach our children that everyone is equal under the law, discriminating against same-sex couples just isn't right. It's as simple as that.[178] At the 2012 DNC, Michelle said, \"Barack knows the American Dream because he's lived it ... and he wants everyone in this country to have that same opportunity, no matter who we are, or where we're from, or what we look like, or who we love.\"[179] In May 2009, Obama delivered the commencement speech at a graduating ceremony at UC Merced in Merced County, California, the address being praised afterward by students who found her relatable. Kevin Fagan of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that there was chemistry between Obama and the students.[180] In August 2013, Obama attended the 50th anniversary ceremony for the March on Washington at the Lincoln Memorial. Positive attention was brought to Obama's attire, a black sleeveless dress with red flowers, designed by Tracy Reese.[181][182] Reese reacted by releasing a public statement that she was honored the first lady \"would choose to wear one of our designs during the celebration of such a deeply significant historical moment\".[183][184] In March 2015, Obama traveled to Selma, Alabama, with her family to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery marches.[185] After President Obama's remarks there, the Obamas joined original marchers, including John Lewis, in crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge.[186][187] In July 2015, Obama journeyed to Coachella Valley while coming to Los Angeles for that year's Special Olympics World Games.[188] In October 2015, Obama was joined by Jill Biden and Prince Harry in visiting a military base in Fort Belvoir, Virginia, in an attempt on the prince's part to raise awareness to programs supporting harmed service members.[189] In December 2015, Obama traveled with her husband to San Bernardino, California, to meet with families of the victims of a terrorist attack that occurred two weeks earlier.[190] On April 1, 2009, Obama met with Queen Elizabeth II in Buckingham Palace. Obama embraced her before attending an event with world leaders.[191] Obama praised her, though the hug generated controversy for being out of protocol when greeting Elizabeth.[192][193] In April 2010, Obama traveled to Mexico, her first solo visit to a nation.[194] In Mexico, Obama spoke to students, encouraging them to take responsibility for their futures.[195][196] Referring to the underprivileged children, Obama argued that \"potential can be found in some of the most unlikely places,\" citing herself and her husband as examples.[197][198] Obama traveled to Africa for the second official trip in June 2011, touring Johannesburg, Cape Town and Botswana and meeting with Graça Machel. Obama was also involved with community events in the foreign countries.[199] It was commented by White House staff that her trip to Africa would advance the foreign policy of her husband.[200][201] In March 2014, Obama visited China along with her two daughters Malia and Sasha, and her mother Marian Robinson. She met with Peng Liyuan, the wife of Chinese president Xi Jinping, visited historic and cultural sites, as well as a university and two high schools.[202][203] Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said the visit and intent in Obama journeying there was to symbolize \"the relationship between the United States and China is not just between leaders, it's a relationship between peoples.\"[204][205] In January 2015, Obama traveled to Saudi Arabia alongside her husband, following the death of King Abdullah. She received criticism for not covering her head in a nation where women are forbidden from publicly not doing so,[206][207] though Obama was defended for being a foreigner and thus not having to submit to Saudi Arabia's customs,[208] even being praised in some corners.[209] Obama was neither greeted nor acknowledged by King Salman during the encounter.[210] In June 2015, Obama undertook a weeklong trip to London and three Italian cities. In London, she spoke with students about international education for adolescent girls and met with both British prime minister David Cameron and Prince Harry. She was joined by her two daughters and mother.[211] In November, she spent a week in Qatar, her first official visit to the Middle East. She continued advancing her initiative for international education for women by speaking at the 2015 World Innovation Summit for Education for her \"Let Girls Learn\" initiative in Doha, Qatar, and touring a school in Amman, Jordan, where she met with female students.[30][212][213] During the Qatar trip, Obama had intended to visit Jordan as well, but the trip was canceled due to weather conditions. In Jordan, Obama had intended to visit an Amman school that had been constructed with assistance from U.S. funds.[214] In March 2016, Obama accompanied her husband and children to Cuba in a trip that was seen by the administration as having the possibility of positively impacting relations between the country and America.[215][216] Later that month, the first couple and their daughters traveled to Argentina,[217] meeting with Argentine president Mauricio Macri.[218][219] Obama campaigned for Democratic candidates in the 2010 midterm elections,[220][221] making her debut on the campaign trail in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.[222][223] By the time she began campaigning, Obama's approval rating was 20 percentage points higher than her husband's.[224] Though Obama indicated in January 2010 that a consensus had not been made about whether she would campaign,[225] speculation of her involvement came from her large approval rating as well as reports that she had been invited to speak at events with Democrats such as Barbara Boxer, Mary Jo Kilroy and Joe Sestak.[226] She toured seven states in two weeks within October 2010.[227] Aides reported that, though viewed as essential by the White House, she would not become deeply involved with political discussions nor engage Republicans in public disputes.[228] After the elections, only six of the thirteen Democratic candidates Obama had campaigned for won. The Los Angeles Times concluded that while Obama was indeed more popular than her husband, her \"election scorecard proved no better than his, particularly in her home state\".[229] Obama was a participant in the 2014 midterm elections, held at a time where her popularity superseded her husband's to such an extent that it was theorized she would receive a much larger outpour of support in campaigning. Reporting her travel to Denver, Colorado, David Lightman wrote that while Democrats did not want President Obama to campaign for them, \"the first lady is very popular.\"[230] In May 2014, Obama was found to have a 61% favorable approval rating from a CNN poll, her husband coming in at 43%.[231] In a video released in July, as part of an effort to encourage voter turnout, she called on voters to be \"hungry as you were back in 2008 and 2012\".[232] Obama appeared at a fundraiser in Georgia in September for Democratic senate candidate Michelle Nunn. Obama's approach to campaigning in Georgia strayed from discussing current events and instead broadly stressed the importance of registering to vote and turning out during the elections.[231] Obama's infrequent appearances came from her dislike of being away from her children and Washington politics as well as her distaste for the opposition by Republicans to her husband's agenda and her view that Democrats in the U.S. Senate had not sufficiently been supporters of her initiatives to end childhood obesity.[233] Obama raised her profile in October,[234][235] touring three states in four days.[233] Obama called the elections her husband's \"last campaign\".[236][237] Obama endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and made several high-profile speeches in favor of her, including an address at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.[238] She also appeared multiple times on the campaign trail in either solo or joint appearances with Clinton.[239] On October 13, 2016, Obama heavily criticized Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for the statements he made in a 2005 audio recording while at a Clinton rally in Manchester, New Hampshire.[240] A week later, Trump attempted to revive past comments Obama made in regard to Clinton during the 2008 presidential election.[241][242] With the ascent of her husband as a prominent national politician, Obama became a part of popular culture. In May 2006, Essence listed her among \"25 of the World's Most Inspiring Women\".[243][244] In July 2007, Vanity Fair listed her among \"10 of the World's Best Dressed People\". She was an honorary guest at Oprah Winfrey's Legends Ball as a \"young'un\" paying tribute to the \"Legends\" who helped pave the way for African-American women. In September 2007, 02138 magazine listed her 58th of \"The Harvard 100\"; a list of the prior year's most influential Harvard alumni. Her husband was ranked fourth.[243][245] In July 2008, she made a repeat appearance on the Vanity Fair international best dressed list.[246] She also appeared on the 2008 People list of best-dressed women and was praised by the magazine for her \"classic and confident\" look.[247][248] At the time of her husband's election, some sources anticipated that as a high-profile African-American woman in a stable marriage Obama would be a positive role model who would influence the view the world has of African Americans.[249][250] Her fashion choices were part of the 2009 Fashion week,[251] but Obama's influence in the field did not have the impact on the paucity of African-American models who participate, that some thought it might.[252][253] Obama's public support grew in her early months as First Lady,[134][254] as she was accepted as a role model.[134] On her first trip abroad in April 2009, she toured a cancer ward with Sarah Brown, wife of British prime minister Gordon Brown.[255] Newsweek described her first trip abroad as an exhibition of her so-called \"star power\"[254] and MSN described it as a display of sartorial elegance.[244] Questions were raised by some in the American and British media regarding protocol when the Obamas met Queen Elizabeth II[256] and Michelle reciprocated a touch on her back by the Queen during a reception, purportedly against traditional royal etiquette.[256][257] Palace sources denied that any breach in etiquette had occurred.[258] Obama has been compared to Jacqueline Kennedy due to her sense of style[246] and also to Barbara Bush for her discipline and decorum.[259][260] Obama's style has been described as \"fashion populist\".[51] In 2010, she wore clothes, many high end, from more than fifty design companies with less expensive pieces from J.Crew and Target, and the same year a study found that her patronage was worth an average of $14 million to a company.[261] She became a fashion trendsetter, in particular favoring sleeveless dresses, including her first-term official portrait in a dress by Michael Kors and her ball gowns designed by Jason Wu for both inaugurals.[262] She has also been known for wearing clothes by African designers such as Mimi Plange, Duro Olowu, Maki Oh, and Osei Duro, and styles such as the Adire fabric.[263][264] Obama appeared on the cover and in a photo spread in the March 2009 issue of Vogue.[265][266] Every first lady since Lou Hoover (except Bess Truman) has been in Vogue,[265] but only Hillary Clinton had previously appeared on the cover.[267] Obama later appeared two more times on the cover of Vogue, while First Lady, the last time in December 2016, with photographs by Annie Leibovitz.[268] In August 2011, she became the first woman ever to appear on the cover of Better Homes and Gardens magazine, and the first person in 48 years.[269] In 2013, during the 85th Academy Awards, she became the first first lady to announce the winner of an Oscar (Best Picture, which went to Argo).[270] The media have been criticized for focusing more on the first lady's fashion sense than her serious contributions.[51][271] She said after the 2008 election that she would like to focus attention as First Lady on issues of concern to military and working families.[249][272][273] In 2008, U.S. News & World Report blogger, PBS host and Scripps Howard columnist Bonnie Erbé argued that Obama's own publicists seemed to be feeding the emphasis on style over substance,[274] and said Obama was miscasting herself by overemphasizing style.[73][275] For three straight years – 2018, 2019, and 2020 – Obama topped the Gallup poll asking who is the \"most admired woman\" in the U.S.[276][277] Time magazine features an annual \"Person of the Year\" cover story in which Time recognizes the individual or group of individuals who have had the biggest impact on news headlines over the previous twelve months. In 2020, the magazine decided to retroactively choose a historically deserving woman for each year in which a man had been named Person of the Year, reflecting the fact that a woman or women had been named Person of the Year only eleven times in the preceding hundred. As part of this review, Michelle Obama was named the Woman of the Year for 2008.[278] In May 2017, during an appearance at the Partnership for a Healthier America conference, Obama rebuked the Trump administration for its delay of a federal requirement designed to increase the nutritional standards for school lunches.[279] In June, while attending the WWDC in Silicon Valley, California, Obama called for tech companies to add women for the diversifying of their ranks.[280] In July, Obama honored Eunice Shriver at the 2017 ESPY Awards.[281] In September, Obama delivered an address at the tech conference in Utah charging the Trump administration with having a fearful White House,[282] appeared in a video for the Global Citizens Festival advocating more attention to giving young girls an education,[283] and attended the Inbound 2017 conference in Boston.[284] During an October 3 appearance at the Philadelphia Conference for Women, Obama cited a lack of diversity in politics with contributing to lawmakers being distrusted by other groups.[285] In November, Obama discussed gender disparity in attitudes with Elizabeth Alexander while attending the Obama Foundation Summit in Chicago,[286] and spoke at the Bushnell Center for the Performing Arts in Hartford, Connecticut.[287] In April 2018, Obama responded to speculation that she might be running for president by saying she has \"never had the passion for politics\" and that \"there are millions of women who are inclined and do have the passion for politics.\"[288] On January 2, 2021, Obama encouraged Georgia residents to vote in the state's runoff in the U.S. Senate election and to contact VoteRiders, a non-profit voter ID education organization, to make sure they have the necessary ID to vote.[289] On January 20, 2021, Obama and her husband attended the inauguration of Joe Biden. Michelle Obama wore a matching plum coat, sweater, pants, and belt designed by Sergio Hudson to the inauguration.[290] In 2021, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.[291] On April 28, 2023, Obama, along with actress Kate Capshaw, joined Bruce Springsteen on stage during his show in Barcelona where they provided backing vocals and tambourine on Springsteen's song \"Glory Days\".[292] Amid media speculation over the candidacy of President Biden, Obama's office announced in March 2024 that she would not be running for president in the 2024 United States presidential election.[293] According to a Reuters/Ipsos public opinion poll among 892 registered voters released on July 2, 2024, Michelle Obama was the only listed Democrat option who would defeat Trump in a confrontation, with 50% of the votes for Obama versus 39% for Trump. 55% of the voters also had a favourable view of Obama versus 42% toward Trump.[294][295] On August 20, 2024, Obama gave the next-to-last address on the second night of the 2024 Democratic National Convention and then introduced the final speaker, her husband, former president Barack Obama. The New York Times called her speech \"electrifying\" and suggested she had outshone her husband.[296] Obama's memoir, Becoming, was released in November 2018.[297] By November 2019, it had sold 11.5 million copies.[298] A documentary titled Becoming, which chronicles Obama's book tour promoting the memoir, was released on Netflix on May 6, 2020.[299][300] She received the Grammy Award for Best Audio Book, Narration & Storytelling Recording in 2020.[301] In July 2020, she premiered a podcast titled The Michelle Obama Podcast.[302][303] In February 2021, Obama was announced as an executive producer and presenter on a children's cooking show, Waffles + Mochi.[304] It was released by Netflix on March 16, 2021.[305][306] On September 11, 2021, the Obamas attended a 9/11 memorial to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the attacks.[307] More recently, Regina Hicks had signed a deal with Netflix alongside her and Barack's Higher Ground production company to develop comedies.[308] She received two Children's and Family Emmy Awards at the 1st Children's and Family Emmy Awards: for Outstanding Short Form Program (We the People) and Outstanding Preschool Animated Series (Ada Twist, Scientist).[309] Obama has made occasional guest appearances on TV shows, often portraying herself: iCarly in 2012, Parks and Recreation in 2014, NCIS in 2016, and Black-ish in 2022. She received a Black Reel Awards for Television nomination for Outstanding Guest Actress, Comedy Series for her role in Black-ish.[310] She produced the documentary film Crip Camp (2020) and the biographical drama film Rustin (2023). On July 21, 2022, it was announced that Obama's next book, The Light We Carry: Overcoming in Uncertain Times, would be published in November 2022.[311] The book was published by Penguin Random House.[312] In 2023, Obama received Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Hosted Nonfiction Series or Special nomination at the 75th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards for the Netflix documentary film The Light We Carry: Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey.[313] In November 2023, Obama was named to the BBC's 100 Women list.[314]",

She is the first African-American First Lady of the United States. Through her four main initiatives, she became a role model for women and an advocate for healthy families, service members and their families, higher education, and international adolescent girls education. Each of us also comes here tonight,” Michelle Obama told the Democratic National Convention in 2008, “by way of our own improbable journey” and “driven by a simple belief that . . . we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be.” Michelle Obama’s journey began in the South Side of Chicago, where Fraser and Marian Robinson instilled in their daughter a heartfelt commitment to family, hard work, and education. Her father was a pump operator for the Chicago Water Department, while her mother stayed at home to care for Michelle and her older brother Craig. As she watched her father refuse to give in to multiple sclerosis, use two canes to get to his job, and save money to send her to college, she learned that “the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them.” Michelle earned a bachelor’s degree from Princeton University and a juris doctor degree from Harvard Law School. In 1988, she returned to Chicago to join the firm of Sidley Austin. It was there that she met Barack Obama, a summer associate she was assigned to advise. They were married in 1992. By that time Michelle had turned her energies to public service. She was assistant commissioner of planning and development in Chicago’s City Hall before becoming the founding executive director of the Chicago chapter of Public Allies, an AmeriCorps program that prepares young people for public service. In 1996, she joined the University of Chicago as associate dean of student services, where she developed the university’s first community service program. In 2002, she went to work for the University of Chicago Medical Center, where in 2005 she became the vice president of community and external affairs. During these years the Obamas’ daughters Malia and Sasha were born. As first lady, Michelle Obama initiated Let’s Move! a program aiming to end childhood obesity within a generation. Through it, elected officials, business leaders, educators, parents, and faith leaders worked together to provide more nutritious food in schools, bring healthy and affordable food into underserved communities, plant vegetable gardens across America, and provide new opportunities for kids to be more active. Each year local schoolchildren helped plant and harvest the garden she started on the White House South Lawn. Its vegetables and fruits were served at the White House and donated to soup kitchens and food banks. During Barack Obama’s second term Michelle spearheaded the Reach Higher Initiative to help students understand job opportunities and the education and skills they need for those jobs. She encouraged young people to continue their education past high school in technical schools and community colleges as well as at colleges and universities. Worldwide, she championed the education of girls and women. In a commencement address at the City College of New York she told graduates, “Never view your challenges as obstacles.” It is a lesson she has embodied all her life. Throughout her time in the White House Mrs. Obama worked to support veterans and military families. She also focused her energies on what she calls her most important role: MominChief to her daughters, who grew into accomplished young women during their eight years in the White House.

                "content": "Jump to main content Jump to navigation First Lady Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama is a lawyer, writer, and the wife of the 44th and current President, Barack Obama. She is the first African-American First Lady of the United States. Through her four main initiatives, she has become a role model for women and an advocate for healthy families, service members and their families, higher education, and international adolescent girls education. When people ask First Lady Michelle Obama to describe herself, she doesn't hesitate to say that first and foremost, she is Malia and Sasha's mom. But before she was a mother — or a wife, lawyer, or public servant — she was Fraser and Marian Robinson's daughter. The Robinsons lived in a brick bungalow on the South Side of Chicago. Fraser was a pump operator for the Chicago Water Department, and despite being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis at a young age, he hardly ever missed a day of work. Marian stayed home to raise Michelle and her older brother Craig, skillfully managing a busy household filled with love, laughter, and important life lessons. A product of Chicago public schools, Michelle Robinson studied sociology and African-American studies at Princeton University. After graduating from Harvard Law School in 1988, she joined the Chicago law firm Sidley & Austin, where she later met Barack Obama, the man who would become the love of her life. After a few years, Mrs. Obama decided her true calling was working with people to serve their communities and their neighbors. She served as assistant commissioner of planning and development in Chicago's City Hall before becoming the founding executive director of the Chicago chapter of Public Allies, an AmeriCorps program that prepares youth for public service. In 1996, Mrs. Obama joined the University of Chicago with a vision of bringing campus and community together. As Associate Dean of Student Services, she developed the university's first community service program, and under her leadership as Vice President of Community and External Affairs for the University of Chicago Medical Center, volunteerism skyrocketed. Mrs. Obama has continued her efforts to support and inspire young people during her time as First Lady. In 2010, she launched Let’s Move!, bringing together community leaders, educators, medical professionals, parents, and others in a nationwide effort to address the challenge of childhood obesity. Let’s Move! has an ambitious goal: to solve the epidemic of childhood obesity within a generation. Whether it's providing healthier food in our schools, helping kids be more physically active, or urging companies to market healthier foods to our children, Let’s Move! is focused on giving parents the support they need to make healthier choices for their kids. In 2011, Mrs. Obama and Dr. Jill Biden came together to launch Joining Forces, a nationwide initiative calling all Americans to rally around service members, veterans, and their families and support them through wellness, education, and employment opportunities. Joining Forces works hand in hand with the public and private sector to ensure that service members, veterans, and their families have the tools they need to succeed throughout their lives. In 2014, Mrs. Obama launched the Reach Higher Initiative, an effort to inspire young people across America to take charge of their future by completing their education past high school, whether at a professional training program, a community college, or a four-year college or university. Reach Higher aims to ensure that all students understand what they need to complete their education by working to expose students to college and career opportunities; helping them understand financial aid eligibility; encouraging academic planning and summer learning opportunities; and supporting high school counselors who do essential work to help students get into college. In 2015, Mrs. Obama joined President Obama to launch Let Girls Learn, a U.S. government-wide initiative to help girls around the world go to school and stay in school. As part of this effort, Mrs. Obama is calling on countries across the globe to help educate and empower young women, and she is sharing the stories and struggles of these young women with young people here at home to inspire them to commit to their own education. As First Lady, Mrs. Obama looks forward to continuing her work on the issues close to her heart — supporting military families, helping children lead healthier lives, and encouraging all our young people to fulfill their boundless promise.",

Michelle Obama was first lady (2009–17) as the wife of Barack Obama, 44th president of the United States. She was the first African American first lady, and she focused on supporting military families and ending childhood obesity. To promote healthy eating, she planted a vegetable garden on the South Lawn of the White House. Michelle Obama studied sociology and African American studies (B.A., 1985) at Princeton University in New Jersey before attending Harvard Law School (J.D., 1988). Michelle Obama worked as a junior associate at a private law firm, where she specialized in intellectual property law. She had several positions in Chicago city government in the 1990s, and, from 1996 until she became first lady, Obama worked as an associate dean and in several executive roles at the University of Chicago. Michelle Obama (born January 17, 1964, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.) is an American first lady (2009–17), the wife of Barack Obama, 44th president of the United States. She was the first African American first lady. Michelle Robinson, who grew up on Chicago’s South Side, was the daughter of Marian, a homemaker, and Frasier Robinson, a worker in the city’s water-purification plant. She studied sociology and African American studies at Princeton University (B.A., 1985) in New Jersey before attending Harvard Law School (J.D., 1988). Returning to Chicago, she took a job as a junior associate at Sidley & Austin (now Sidley Austin LLP), where she specialized in intellectual property law. In 1989, while at the firm, she met Barack Obama, who had been hired as a summer associate. Seeking a more public-service-oriented career path, in 1991 she became an assistant to Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley. The following year she and Barack, then a community organizer, were married. From 1992 to 1993 Michelle was the assistant commissioner for the Chicago Department of Planning and Development, and in 1993 she founded the Chicago branch of Public Allies, a leadership-training program for young adults; she served as the branch’s executive director until 1996. Barack was elected to the Illinois Senate in 1996, and that year Michelle became the associate dean of student services at the University of Chicago, where she helped organize the school’s community outreach programs. In 2002 she became the executive director of community and external affairs for the University of Chicago. Two years later Barack was elected to the U.S. Senate and came to national prominence with a speech he gave on the final night of the 2004 Democratic National Convention. In 2005 she became vice president of community and external affairs for the University of Chicago Medical Center. When her husband announced his candidacy for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination, Michelle took a prominent role in his campaign. She took leave from her position at the University of Chicago to devote herself more fully to campaigning while still maintaining time to care for her and Barack’s two young daughters. An adept speaker, she stumped extensively for her husband during the long Democratic primary race, and in June 2008 Barack became the party’s presumptive nominee. Michelle’s openness on the campaign trail and in interviews—she often humanized her husband by discussing his faults and implored observers not to “deify him”—endeared her to many. However, critics of her husband’s campaign took issue with some of her comments—such as when she remarked, while campaigning in Wisconsin in February 2008, that “for the first time in my adult lifetime, I am really proud of my country.” Michelle later clarified her statement—saying that she meant to say that she was proud that Americans were eagerly engaging in the political process during the 2008 election—and she continued to have an active role in her husband’s campaign. Indeed, campaign aides referred to her as “the closer,” for her persuasiveness on the stump among uncommitted voters who attended rallies. On November 4, 2008, Barack was elected 44th president of the United States, defeating Arizona Sen. John McCain; he took office on January 20, 2009, and was reelected in 2012. As first lady, Michelle was involved in various causes, notably supporting military families and ending childhood obesity. In an effort to promote healthy eating, she planted a vegetable garden on the South Lawn of the White House in 2009. She related her experiences with the project in the book American Grown: The Story of the White House Kitchen Garden and Gardens Across America (2012). In addition to her work on such issues, Michelle also garnered attention for her fashion sense. During the 2016 presidential race, Michelle supported the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, and her speech during the party’s national convention drew widespread praise; noting the coarse tenor of the race, Michelle stated that “when they go low, we go high.” Clinton ultimately lost to Republican Donald Trump, who had repeatedly and falsely suggested that Barack was not a U.S.-born citizen. After her husband’s term ended in 2017, Michelle kept a relatively low public profile. However, in 2018 she released the autobiography Becoming, which garnered much attention and became one of the top-selling memoirs in the history of publishing. Although the book largely avoided politics, her criticism of Trump, whom she claimed endangered her family with his role in the “birther” conspiracy, drew particular interest. A tour for the book was the basis of the documentary Becoming (2020), which aired on Netflix; Michelle and Barack had signed a production deal with the media-streaming company in 2018. In 2020 she also hosted The Michelle Obama Podcast, which was available on Spotify, an Internet music-streaming service. Two years later Michelle published The Light We Carry: Overcoming in Uncertain Times, in which she offered insights into handling difficult times, using her own personal experiences as examples.",

                "content": "Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama[1] (born January 17, 1964) is an American lawyer and author. She was the first lady of the United States from 2009 to 2017 as the wife of Barack Obama, the 44th U.S. president. She was also the first African-American first lady in U.S. history. As first lady, Obama was seen as a role model for women. She worked as an advocate for poverty awareness, education, nutrition, physical activity, and healthy eating. She supported American designers and was considered a fashion icon.[2] Michelle LaVaughn Robinson was born on January 17, 1964, at Provident Hospital of Cook County in Chicago, Illinois,[3] to Fraser Robinson III,[4] a city water plant employee and Marian Shields Robinson.[5] Her mother was a full-time homemaker until Robinson entered high school.[6] By sixth grade, Robinson attended Mawr Elementary School.[7] She attended Whitney Young High School,[8] where she was on the honor roll for four years, took advanced placement classes, was a member of the National Honor Society and served as student council treasurer.[9] She graduated in 1981. Robinson enrolled into Princeton University in 1981.[10][11] She majored in sociology and minored in African-American studies and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1985.[12][13][14] While at Princeton, Robinson became involved with the Third World Center, an academic and cultural group who supported minority students. She ran their daycare center, which also offered after school tutoring for older children.[15] As part of her requirements for graduation, she wrote a sociology thesis, titled Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community.[16][17] Robinson pursued professional study, earning her Juris Doctor degree from Harvard Law School in 1988.[18] At Harvard, Robinson participated in demonstrations advocating the hiring of professors who were members of minority groups.[19] She worked for the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, assisting low-income tenants with housing cases.[20] Following law school, Obama became an associate at the Chicago office of the law firm Sidley & Austin, where she worked on marketing and property law.[21] In 1993, she became executive director for the Chicago office of Public Allies, a non-profit organization encouraging young people to work on social issues in nonprofit groups and government agencies.[22] In 1996, Obama served as the Associate Dean of Student Services at the University of Chicago.[23] In 2002, she began working for the University of Chicago Hospitals, first as executive director for community affairs and, beginning May 2005, as vice president for Community and External Affairs.[24] Robinson met Barack Obama when they were among the few African Americans at their law firm, Sidley Austin LLP.[25] Their relationship started with a business lunch and then a community organization meeting.[26] They got married on October 3, 1992.[26] Their first daughter, Malia Ann was born in July 1998 and their second daughter, Sasha was born June 2001.[27] Obama became the first lady of the United States when her husband was sworn in as the 44th president on January 20, 2009. She became the first African-American first lady in American history. As first lady, Obama visited homeless shelters and soup kitchens.[28] She also sent representatives to schools and advocated public service.[28][29] Obama's initiatives as first lady were: Let's Move!, Reach Higher,[30] Let Girls Learn,[31] and Joining Forces.[32] Some initiatives included advocating for military families.[33][34] She made supporting military families and spouses a personal mission and increasingly bonded with military families.[34] In January 2010, Obama started an initiative, which she named \"Let's Move!\", to make progress in reversing the 21st-century trend of childhood obesity.[35][36] On February 9, 2010, President Barack Obama created the Task Force on Childhood Obesity to review all current programs and create a national plan for change.[37] In 2010, she wore clothes, many high end, from more than fifty designer companies.[38] She wore sleeveless dresses by Michael Kors, and her ball gowns designed by Jason Wu for both inaugurals.[39] She has also been known for wearing clothes by African designers such as Mimi Plange, Duro Olowu, Maki Oh, and Osei Duro.[40][41] Obama appeared on the cover in the March 2009 issue of Vogue.[42][43] She later appeared two more times on the cover of Vogue, while first lady, the last time in December 2016, with photographs by Annie Leibovitz.[44] In August 2011, she became the first woman ever to appear on the cover of Better Homes and Gardens magazine.[45] In 2021, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.[46] Obama's memoir, Becoming, was released in November 2018.[47] By November 2019, it had sold 11.5 million copies.[48] A documentary titled Becoming, which chronicles Obama's book tour promoting the memoir, was released on Netflix on May 6, 2020.[49][50] She received Grammy Award for Best Audio Book, Narration & Storytelling Recording in 2020 for audio book.[51] In July 2020, she premiered a podcast titled The Michelle Obama Podcast.[52][53] In February 2021, Obama was announced as an executive producer and presenter on a children's cooking show, Waffles + Mochi.[54] It was released by Netflix on March 16, 2021.[55][56] On July 21, 2022, it was announced that Obama's next book, The Light We Carry: Overcoming in Uncertain Times, would be published in November 2022.[57] The book was published by Penguin Random House.[58] In 2023, Obama received a Emmy Award for the Netflix documentary film The Light We Carry: Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey.[59] In November 2023, Obama was named to the BBC's 100 Women list.[60] Time magazine features an annual \"Person of the Year\" cover story in which Time recognizes the individual or group of individuals who have had the biggest impact on news headlines over the previous twelve months. In 2020, the magazine decided to retroactively choose a historically deserving woman for each year in which a man had been named Person of the Year, reflecting the fact that a woman or women had been named Person of the Year only eleven times in the preceding hundred. As part of this review, Michelle Obama was named the Woman of the Year for 2008.[62]",

                "content": "The Football Association Challenge Cup, more commonly known as the FA Cup, is an annual knockout football competition in domestic English football. First played during the 1871–72 season, it is the oldest national football competition in the world.[1] It is organised by and named after The Football Association (The FA). A concurrent Women's FA Cup has been held since 1970. The competition is open to all eligible clubs down to level 9 of the English football league system, with level 10 clubs acting as stand-ins in the event of non-entries from above.[2] A record 763 clubs competed in 2011–12. The tournament consists of 12 randomly drawn rounds followed by the semi-finals and the final. Entrants are not seeded, although a system of byes based on league level ensures higher ranked teams enter in later rounds – the minimum number of games needed to win, depending on which round a team enters the competition, ranges from six to fourteen. The first six rounds are the Qualifying Competition, and are contested by clubs in the National League System, levels 5 to 10 of the English football system, more commonly called non-League. 32 of these teams progress to the first round of the Competition Proper, meeting the first of the 48 professional teams from Leagues One and Two. The last entrants are the 20 Premier League and 24 Championship clubs, into the draw for the third round proper.[2] In the modern era, only one non-League team has ever reached the quarter-finals, and teams below Level 2 have never reached the final.[note 1] As a result, significant focus is given to the smaller teams who progress furthest, especially if they achieve an unlikely \"giant-killing\" victory. Winners receive the FA Cup trophy, of which there have been two designs and five actual cups; the latest is a 2014 replica of the second design, introduced in 1911. Winners also qualify for the UEFA Europa League and a place in the upcoming FA Community Shield. Arsenal are the most successful club with fourteen titles, most recently in 2020, and their former manager Arsène Wenger is the competition's most successful, having won seven finals with the team. Manchester United are the current holders, having defeated local rivals Manchester City 2–1 in the 2024 final. In 1863, the newly founded Football Association (the FA) published the Laws of the Game of Association Football, unifying the various different rules in use before then. On 20 July 1871, in the offices of The Sportsman newspaper, the FA Secretary C. W. Alcock proposed to the FA committee that \"it is desirable that a Challenge Cup should be established in connection with the Association for which all clubs belonging to the Association should be invited to compete\". The inaugural FA Cup tournament kicked off in November 1871. After thirteen games in all, Wanderers were crowned the winners in the final, on 16 March 1872. Wanderers retained the trophy the following year. The modern cup was beginning to be established by the 1888–89 season, when qualifying rounds were introduced.[3] Following the 1914–15 edition, the competition was suspended in mid air due to the First World War, and did not resume until 1919–20. The 1923 FA Cup Final, commonly known as the \"White Horse Final\", was the first final to be played in the newly opened Wembley Stadium (known at the time as the Empire Stadium). The 1927 final saw \"Abide with Me\" being sung for the first time at the Cup final, which has become a pre-match tradition.[4] Due to the outbreak of World War II, the competition was not played between the 1938–39 and 1945–46 editions. Due to the wartime breaks, the competition did not celebrate its centenary year until 1980–81. After some confusion over the rules in its first competition, the FA decided that any drawn match would lead to a replay, with teams competing in further replays until a game was eventually won.[5] Alvechurch and Oxford City contested the most replayed tie in the 1971–72 qualification, in a tie which went to 6 matches.[5] Multiple replays were scrapped for the competition proper in 1991–92, and the qualifying rounds in 1997–98.[5] Replays were removed altogether from the semi-final and final matches in 2000, from the quarter-finals in 2016–17, the fifth round in 2019–20[5] and the first round onwards from 2024 to 2025.[6] Redevelopment of Wembley saw the final played outside of England for the first time, the 2001–2006 finals being played at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. The final returned to Wembley in 2007, followed by the semi-finals from 2008. An application window is open to clubs before entry lists, round byes and scheduling are announced in July. All clubs in the top four levels (the Premier League and the three divisions of the English Football League) are automatically eligible. Clubs from Level 5–9 (non-league football) are also eligible provided they play in either the FA Trophy or FA Vase competitions in the current season. All participating clubs must also have a stadium suitable for the competition and The Association may reject applications at its discretion.[2] Previously, Level 10 clubs were a prominent feature in early qualifying rounds. The gradual remodelling of the National League System to a 'perfect' 1–2–4–8–16 system, with a first phase in 2018–19, a final phase in 2021–22 (which included the promotion of 107 clubs), and played to a full quota in 2022–23 has resulted in a larger number of teams playing in Level 7–9.[7][8][9] Consequently, for the FA Cup, entries equal the number in tiers 1–9 and is cut off to those below.[2] Though still able to apply, Level 10 clubs are used as alternatives \"subject to availability\" in the event of a non/rejected applicant (with vacancies filled by Level 10 applicants with the best PPG in the previous league season).[2] The total number of entries in the FA Cup has changed as Non-League football has gradually been expanded and reorganised over time. In the 2004–05 season, 660 clubs entered the competition, beating the long-standing record of 656 from the 1921–22 season. In 2005–06 this increased to 674 entrants, in 2006–07 to 687, in 2007–08 to 731 clubs, in 2008–09 and 2009–10 to 762.[10] The total number of entries has also varied naturally from year-to-year as new clubs form and others dissolve at unequal rates. Though most leagues in the National League System maintain the same number of teams via reprieves, inevitably entry-level divisions (typically at tier 10) have to be impacted when a club leaves the pyramid.[11] Therefore, for example, 759 teams entered in 2010–11, a record 763 in 2011–12, 758 in 2012–13, 737 in 2013–14 and 736 in 2014–15.[10] However, since 2021–22, The FA has cut off automatic eligibility to the 10th tier (to appear only subject to availability) and instead set the size of the draw to match the more stable number of teams in Level 1–9.[12] This means that the competition may now see a standardised number of entries from one year to the next.[13] This number is currently 732 but could rise to 748 for 2023–24 with plans for a new SWPL 9th tier division to share the South West with the existing Western League.[14] It is very rare for top clubs to miss the competition, although it can happen in exceptional circumstances. Manchester United did not defend their title in 1999–2000, as they were already in the inaugural Club World Championship. The club stated that entering both tournaments would overload their fixture schedule and make it more difficult to defend their Champions League and Premier League titles. The club claimed that they did not want to devalue the FA Cup by fielding a weaker side. The move benefited United as they received a two-week break and won the 1999–2000 league title by an 18-point margin, although they did not progress past the group stage of the Club World Championship. The withdrawal from the FA Cup, however, drew considerable criticism as this weakened the tournament's prestige and Sir Alex Ferguson later admitted his regret regarding their handling of the situation.[15][16][17] Welsh sides that play in English leagues are eligible, although since the creation of the League of Wales there are only five clubs remaining: Cardiff City (the only non-English team to win the tournament, in 1927), Swansea City, Newport County, Wrexham, and Merthyr Town. In the early years other teams from Wales, Ireland and Scotland also took part in the competition, with Glasgow side Queen's Park losing the final to Blackburn Rovers in 1884 and 1885 before being barred from entering by the Scottish Football Association. Entries from clubs affiliated to \"offshore\" associations are also eligible subject to consideration on an annual basis, with special provisions that may apply.[2] In the 2013–14 season the first Channel Island club entered the competition when Guernsey F.C. competed.[18] The first game played in the Channel Islands – and thus the southernmost FA Cup tie played – took place on 7 August 2021 between Jersey Bulls and Horsham YMCA. A third club, F.C. Isle of Man, was also eligible to play in 2022–23, but in the end all Crown Dependency teams either did not appear on the entry list or later withdrew.[19][20] Beginning in August, the competition proceeds as a knockout tournament throughout, consisting of twelve rounds, a semi-final and then a final, in May. A system of byes ensures clubs above level 9 enter the competition at later stages. There is no seeding, the fixtures in each round being determined by a random draw. Fixtures ending in a tie are replayed once only (from the 2024–25 campaign, prior to the first round proper).[21][22] The first six rounds are qualifiers, with the draws organised on a regional basis. The next six rounds are the \"proper\" rounds where all clubs are in one draw. All entrants from Level 9 begin the competition in the extra preliminary round, as well as any Level 10 team filling in for a vacancy.[2] Teams from Level 8 are ranked on their PPG in the previous season, except newly promoted teams automatically ranked towards the bottom and newly relegated teams ranked to the top; teams are then split between entering at either the Extra-Preliminary or preliminary round so as to ensure the right balance of fixtures throughout the competition.[2] From there, clubs from higher levels are added in later rounds, as per the table below. The months in which rounds are played are traditional, with exact dates subject to each calendar. The number of new entries, winners from previous rounds, and division of Level 8 teams in the two preliminary rounds are based on an entry list of 732 modelled on the English league system as of 2022–23. From 2023 to 2024, the entry list could rise to 746 in line with sixteen additional clubs at Level 9 meaning that the extra preliminary round will have 444 teams with only 50 Level 8 clubs entering at the preliminary round.[14] previous round Level 9 clubs Level 8 clubs (96 lowest ranked) The qualifying rounds are regionalised to reduce the travel costs for smaller non-league sides. The first and second proper rounds were also previously split into Northern and Southern sections, but this practice was ended after the 1997–98 competition. [citation needed] The final is normally held the Saturday after the Premier League season finishes in May. The only seasons in recent times when this pattern was not followed were: 1999–2000, when most rounds were played a few weeks earlier than normal as an experiment; 2010–11 and 2012–13 when the FA Cup Final was played before the Premier League season had finished, to allow Wembley Stadium to be ready for the UEFA Champions League final,[23] as well as in 2011–12 to allow England time to prepare for that summer's European Championships;[24] 2019–20 when the final was delayed until August due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom,[25][26] and the 2021-22 when the final was held a week before the end of the league. The 2025 Final is also scheduled to take place the week before the end of the league.[27] The draws for the Extra Preliminary, Preliminary, and first qualifying rounds used to all occur at the same time. Thereafter, the draw for each subsequent round is not made until after the scheduled dates for the previous round, meaning that in the case of replays, clubs will often know their future opponents in advance. The draw for each of the proper rounds is broadcast live on television, usually taking place at the conclusion of live coverage of one of the games of the previous round. Public interest is particularly high during the draw for the third round, which is where the top-ranked teams are added to the draw. In rounds up to and including the fourth round proper, fixtures resulting in a draw (after normal time) go to a replay, played at the venue of the away team, at a later date; if that replay is still tied, the winner is settled by a period of extra time, and if still necessary, a penalty shootout. Since 2016–17, ties have been settled on the day from the quarter-finals onwards, using extra time and penalties. From 2018–19, Fifth round ties are also settled by extra time and penalties. Beginning with the 2024–25 competition, replays have been scrapped from the first round onwards.[28] The decision to scrap replays received criticism from a number of lower-tier clubs and government officials.[29] Until 1990–91, further replays would be played until one team was victorious. In 1971–72, a fourth qualifying round game between Alvechurch and Oxford City was played six times until Alvechurch won in the fifth replay.[30] In their 1975 campaign, Fulham played 12 games over six rounds, which remains the most games played by a team to reach a final.[31] Replays were traditionally played three or four days after the original game, but from 1991–92 they were staged at least 10 days later on police advice for the rounds proper. This led to penalty shoot-outs being introduced, the first of which came on 26 November 1991 when Rotherham United eliminated Scunthorpe United.[32] From 1980–81 to 1998–99, the semi-finals went to extra time on the day if the score after 90 minutes was a draw. If the score was still level after extra time, the match would go to a replay. Replays for the semi-finals were scrapped for 1999–2000; the last semi-final to go into a replay was in 1998–99, when Manchester United beat rivals Arsenal 2–1 after extra time, following a 0–0 draw in the original match. The first FA Cup Final to go to extra time and a replay was the 1875 final, between the Royal Engineers and the Old Etonians. The initial tie finished 1–1 but the Royal Engineers won the replay 2–0 in normal time. The last replayed final was the 1993 FA Cup Final, when Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday fought a 1–1 draw. The replay saw Arsenal win the FA Cup, 2–1 after extra time. The last quarter-final to go to a replay was Manchester United vs West Ham United in the 2015–16 FA Cup. The original game at Old Trafford ended in a 1–1 draw, while Manchester United won the replay at the Boleyn Ground, 2–1. It was also the last FA Cup game ever played at the Boleyn Ground.[33] The last fifth round replay saw Tottenham Hotspur defeat Rochdale 6–1 at Wembley in the 2017–18 FA Cup after the first match at Spotland Stadium ended in a 2–2 draw.[34] The FA Cup winners qualify for the following season's UEFA Europa League (formerly named the UEFA Cup; from its launch in 1960 until 1998, they entered the now-defunct UEFA Cup Winners' Cup instead). This European place applies even if the team is relegated or is not in the English top flight. In the past, if the FA Cup winning team also qualified for the following season's Champions League or Europa League through their league or European performance, then the losing FA Cup finalists were given the European berth of the League Cup winners and the League Cup winners would be given the league berth instead (in the Cup Winners' Cup era, teams qualifying for the UEFA Cup via other competitions would be promoted to the Cup Winners' Cup instead). FA Cup winners enter the Europa League at the group stage. Losing finalists, if they had not qualified for Europe via the league, began earlier, at the play-off or third qualifying round stage.[35] From the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League season, however, UEFA does not allow the runners-up to qualify for the Europa League through the competition.[36] If the winner of the FA Cup has already qualified for a European Competition through their Premier League position, the FA Cup berth is then given to the highest placed team in the Premier League who has not yet qualified for a European Competition. The FA Cup winners also qualify for the following season's single-match FA Community Shield, the traditional season opener played against the previous season's Premier League champions (or the Premier League runners-up if the FA Cup winners also won the league – the double). Fixtures in the 12 rounds of the competition are usually played at the home ground of one of the two teams. The semi-finals and final are played at a neutral venue – the rebuilt Wembley Stadium. In the matches for the 12 competition rounds, the team who plays at home is decided when the fixtures are drawn – simply the first team drawn out for each fixture. Occasionally games may have to be moved to other grounds due to other events taking place, security reasons or a ground not being suitable to host popular teams. However, since 2003, clubs cannot move grounds to the away side's for capacity or financial reasons. If any move has to be made, it has to be to a neutral venue and any additional monies earned by the move goes into the central pot.[37] In the event of a draw, the replay is played at the ground of the team who originally played away from home. In the days when multiple replays were possible, the second replay (and any further replays) were played at neutral grounds. The clubs involved could alternatively agree to toss for home advantage in the second replay. The semi-finals have been played exclusively at the rebuilt Wembley Stadium since 2008, one year after it opened and after it had already hosted a final (in 2007). For the first decade of the competition, the Kennington Oval was used as the semi-final venue. In the period between this first decade and the reopening of Wembley, semi-finals were played at high-capacity neutral venues around England; usually the home grounds of teams not involved in that semi-final, chosen to be roughly equidistant between the two teams for fairness of travel. The top three most used venues in this period were Villa Park in Birmingham (55 times), Hillsborough in Sheffield (34 times) and Old Trafford in Manchester (23 times). The original Wembley Stadium was also used seven times for semi-final, between 1991 and 2000 (the last held there), but not always for fixtures featuring London teams. In 2005, both were held at the Millennium Stadium. In 2003 the FA decided to permanently use the new Wembley for semi-finals to recoup debts in financing the new stadium.[38] This was controversial, with the move seen as both unfair to fans of teams located far from London, as well as taking some of the prestige away from a Wembley final.[39] In defending the move, the FA has also cited the extra capacity Wembley offers, although the 2013 fixture between Millwall and Wigan Athletic led to the unprecedented step of placing 6,000 tickets on sale to neutral fans after the game failed to sell out.[40] A fan poll by The Guardian in 2013 found 86% opposition to Wembley semi-finals.[40] The final has been played at the rebuilt Wembley Stadium since it opened, in 2007.[41] The rebuilding process meant that between 2001 and 2006 they were hosted at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff in Wales. Prior to rebuilding, the final was hosted by the original Wembley Stadium since it opened in 1923 (being originally named the Empire Stadium). One exception to this 78-year series of Empire Stadium finals (including five replays) was the 1970 replay between Leeds United and Chelsea, held at Old Trafford in Manchester. In the 51 years prior to the Empire Stadium opening, the final (including 8 replays) was held in a variety of locations, predominantly in London, and mainly at the Kennington Oval and then Crystal Palace. It was played 22 times at The Oval (the inaugural competition in 1872, and then all but two times until 1892). After The Oval, Crystal Palace hosted 21 finals from 1895 to 1914, broken up by four replays elsewhere. The other London venues were Stamford Bridge from 1920 to 1922 (the last three finals before the move to Empire Stadium); and the University of Oxford's Lillie Bridge in Fulham for the second ever final, in 1873. The other venues used sparingly in this period were all outside of London, as follows: The FA permitted artificial turf (3G) pitches in all rounds of the competition from the 2014–15 edition and beyond.[42] Under the 2015–16 rules, the pitch must be of FIFA One Star quality, or Two Star for ties if they involve one of the 92 professional clubs.[2] This followed approval two years previously for their use in the qualifying rounds only – if a team with a 3G pitch progressed to the competition proper, they had to switch their tie to the ground of another eligible entrant with a natural grass pitch.[43] Having been strong proponents of the surface, the first match in the proper rounds to be played on a 3G surface was a televised first round replay at Maidstone United's Gallagher Stadium on 20 November 2014.[44] The winners of the competition receive the FA Cup. It is only loaned to the club by the FA; under the current (2015–16) rules it must be returned by 1 March, or earlier if given seven days' notice.[2] Traditionally, the holders had the Cup until the following year's presentation, although more recently the trophy has been taken on publicity tours by the FA in between finals.[45] The trophy comes in three parts – the cup itself, plus a lid and a base. There have been two designs of trophy in use, but five physical trophies have been presented. The original trophy, known as the \"little tin idol\", was 18 inches high and made by Martin, Hall & Co. It was stolen in 1895 and never recovered, and so was replaced by an exact replica, used until 1910. The FA decided to change the design after the 1909 winners, Manchester United, made their own replica, leading the FA to realise they did not own the copyright.[46] This new, larger design was by Fattorini and Sons, and was used from 1911.[46] In order to preserve this original, from 1992 it was replaced by an exact replica, although this had to be replaced after just over two decades, after showing wear and tear from being handled more than in previous eras. This third replica, first used in 2014, was built heavier to withstand the increased handling.[45] Of the four surviving trophies, only the 1895 replica has entered private ownership.[47] The name of the winning team is engraved on the silver band around the base as soon as the final has finished, in order to be ready in time for the presentation ceremony.[45] This means the engraver has just five minutes to perform a task which would take 20 under normal conditions, although time is saved by engraving the year on during the match, and sketching the presumed winner.[48] During the final, the trophy is decorated with ribbons in the colours of both finalists, with the loser's ribbons being removed at the end of the game.[49] The tradition of tying ribbons started after Tottenham Hotspur won the 1901 FA Cup Final and the wife of a Spurs director decided to tie blue and white ribbons to the handles of the cup.[50] Traditionally, at Wembley finals, the presentation is made at the Royal Box, with players, led by the captain, mounting a staircase to a gangway in front of the box and returning by a second staircase on the other side of the box. At Cardiff the presentation was made on a podium on the pitch. The tradition of presenting the trophy immediately after the game did not start until the 1882 final; after the first final in 1872 the trophy was not presented to the winners, Wanderers, until a reception held four weeks later in the Pall Mall Restaurant in London.[51] Under the original rules, the trophy was to be permanently presented to any club which won the competition three times, although when inaugural winners Wanderers achieved this feat by the 1876 final, the rules were changed by FA Secretary CW Alcock (who was also captain of Wanderers in their first victory).[52] Portsmouth have the distinction of being the football club which has held the FA Cup trophy for the longest uninterrupted period - seven years. Portsmouth had defeated Wolverhampton Wanderers 4–1 in the 1939 FA Cup Final and were awarded the trophy as 1938–39 FA Cup winners. But with the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, the regular Football League and FA Cup competitions for the 1939–40 season were cancelled for the duration of the war. Portsmouth's manager Jack Tinn was rumoured to have kept the FA Cup trophy 'safe under his bed' throughout the duration of the war, but this is an urban myth. Because the naval city of Portsmouth was a primary strategic military target for German Luftwaffe bombing, the FA Cup trophy was actually taken ten miles to the north of Portsmouth, to the nearby Hampshire village of Lovedean, and there it resided in a quaint thatched roof country pub called The Bird in Hand for the seven years of the war.[53] After the conclusion of World War II, the FA Cup trophy was presented back to the Football Association by the club in time for the 1946 FA Cup Final. The first trophy, the 'little tin idol', was made by Martin, Hall & Co at a cost of £20.[54] It was stolen from a Birmingham shoe shop window belonging to William Shillcock while held by Aston Villa on 11 September 1895 and was never seen again. Despite a £10 reward for information, the crime was never solved. As it happened while it was in their care, the FA fined Villa £25 to pay for a replacement. Just over 60 years later, 80 year old career criminal Henry (Harry) James Burge claimed to have committed the theft, confessing to a newspaper, with the story being published in the Sunday Pictorial newspaper on 23 February 1958. He claimed to have carried out the robbery with two other men, although when discrepancies with a contemporaneous report in the Birmingham Post newspaper (the crime pre-dated written police reports) in his account of the means of entry and other items stolen, detectives decided there was no realistic possibility of a conviction and the case was closed. Burge claimed the cup had been melted down to make counterfeit half-crown coins, which matched known intelligence of the time, in which stolen silver was being used to forge coins which were then laundered through betting shops at a local racecourse, although Burge had no history of forgery in a record of 42 previous convictions for which he had spent 42 years in prison. He had been further imprisoned in 1957 for seven years for theft from cars. Released in 1961, he died in 1964.[55] After the theft, a replica of the trophy was made, which was used until a redesign of the trophy in 1911. The 1895 replica was then presented to the FA's long-serving president Lord Kinnaird.[46] Kinnaird died in 1923, and his family kept it in their possession, out of view, until putting it up for auction in 2005.[56] It was sold at Christie's auction house on 19 May 2005 for £420,000 (£478,400 including auction fees and taxes).[46] The sale price set a new world record for a piece of football memorabilia, surpassing the £254,000 paid for the Jules Rimet World Cup Trophy in 1997.[47] The successful bidder was David Gold, the then joint chairman of Birmingham City; claiming the FA and government were doing nothing proactive to ensure the trophy remained in the country, Gold stated his purchase was motivated by wanting to save it for the nation.[47] Accordingly, Gold presented the trophy to the National Football Museum in Preston on 20 April 2006, where it went on immediate public display.[56] It later moved with the museum to its new location in Manchester.[46] In November 2012, it was ceremonially presented to Royal Engineers, after they beat Wanderers 7–1 in a charity replay of the first FA Cup final. In September 2020, Gold sold the replica trophy for £760,000 through the Bonhams auction house.[57] In January 2021, it was revealed that the trophy had been purchased by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the owner of Manchester City, who stated that it would be returned on loan to the National Football Museum.[58] The redesigned trophy first used in 1911 was larger at 61.5 cm (24.2 inches) high, and was designed and manufactured by Fattorini & Sons of Bradford, coincidentally being won by Bradford City in its first outing.[45][46] On the 27 March 2016 episode of the BBC television programme Antiques Roadshow, this trophy was valued at £1 million by expert Alastair Dickenson, although he suggested that, due to the design featuring depictions of grapes and vines, it may not have been specifically produced for the FA, but was instead an off-the-shelf design originally meant to be a wine or champagne cooler.[46] This was later disproved when Thomas Fattorini was invited to the Antiques Roadshow to \"ambush\" Alastair Dickenson with the competition winning design by Fattorini & Sons. The show was filmed at Baddesley Clinton and subsequently aired on 23 October 2016. A smaller but otherwise identical replica was also made by the company Thomas Fattorini for the North Wales Coast FA Cup trophy which is contested annually by members of that regional Association.[59] The 1992 replica was made by Toye, Kenning and Spencer.[60] A copy of this trophy was also produced, in case anything happened to the primary trophy.[61] The 2014 replica was made by Thomas Lyte, handcrafted in sterling 925 silver over 250 hours. A weight increase for greater durability has taken it to 6.3 kilograms (14 lb).[45] Each club in the final receives 40 winners or runners-up medals to be distributed among players, staff and officials. The traditional styles of gold-cased medals – the winners' medal, which had remained largely unchanged since the 1890s, and runners-up medals, which were last updated in 1946 – were replaced for the 2021 final by new designs of gold winners' medals and silver runners-up medals suspended on a ribbon.[62] Since the start of the 1994–95 season, the FA Cup has been sponsored. However, to protect the identity of the competition, the sponsored name has always included 'The FA Cup' in addition to the sponsor's name, unlike sponsorship deals for the League Cup where the word 'cup' is preceded by only the sponsor's name. Sponsorship deals run for four years, though – as in the case of E.ON – one-year extensions may be agreed. Emirates Airline has been the sponsor since 2015, initially renaming the competition as 'The Emirates FA Cup', unlike previous editions, which included 'The FA Cup in association with E.ON' and 'The FA Cup with Budweiser'.[63] The Emirates sponsorship deal, originally scheduled to terminate in 2018, was later extended three times until 2021, 2024, 2028.[64] From 2006 to 2013, Umbro supplied match balls for all FA Cup matches. They were replaced at the start of the 2013–14 season by Nike, who produced the competition's official match ball for five seasons. Mitre took over for the 2018–19 season, beginning a three-year partnership with the FA.[71] The possibility of unlikely victories in the earlier rounds of the competition, where lower ranked teams beat higher placed opposition in what is known as a \"giant killing\", is much anticipated by the public. Such upsets are considered an integral part of the tradition and prestige of the competition, and the attention gained by giant-killing teams can be as great as that for winners of the cup.[79] Almost every club in the League Pyramid has a fondly remembered giant-killing act in its history.[80] It is considered particularly newsworthy when a top Premier League team suffers an upset defeat, or where the giant-killer is a non-league club, i.e. from outside The Football League. One analysis of four years of FA Cup results showed that it was 99.85 per cent likely that at least one team would beat one from its next higher division in a given year. The probability drops to 48.8 per cent for a two-division gap, and 39.28 per cent for a three-division gap.[80] The Football League was founded in 1888, 16 years after the first FA Cup competition. Before its establishment as the dominant football competition in England, teams from rival leagues did make the final of the FA Cup. The Wednesday (later Sheffield Wednesday) in 1890 reached the final as a member of the Football Alliance, two years before that competition merged with the Football League.[81] Later, with the Football League predominantly in the North and Midlands of England, leading clubs of the Southern Football League were of a level with Football League teams, and in 1901 Southern League members Tottenham Hotspur became the only non-League side to win the Cup,[82] while fellow Southern League team Southampton were losing finalists in 1900 and 1902. In 1920–21, the Football League expanded to incorporate teams from the Southern League's first division, and the following year it added a further division consisting of leading northern and midlands clubs. This consolidated the Football League's position as the leading competition in English football, and established the hierarchy in which non-League clubs in the English football league system competing in the FA Cup would face Football League teams as clear underdogs. Since the expansion of the Football League in 1921, the best performance of a team from outside the Football League was National League side Lincoln City's run to the quarter-finals of the 2016–17 FA Cup, during which they defeated Championship side Brighton 3–1 in the fourth round and Premier League side Burnley 1–0 in the fifth, before falling to ultimate Cup champions Arsenal 5–0 at the Emirates. Lincoln's defeat of Burnley was only the third (and most recent) FA Cup victory for a non-league team over a top-flight side since 1989.[83] Giant-killings can also be applied where the defeated team is from lower down the Football League, particularly where the defeated club is very notable or the winning team particularly obscure. Liverpool, having already won five league titles in their history, were in the Second Division in 1959 when they lost 2–1 to Worcester City of the Southern League.[84] The best-known non-league giant-killing came in the 1971–72 FA Cup, when non-league Hereford United defeated First Division Newcastle United.[85] Hereford were trailing 1–0 with less than seven minutes left in the Third round proper replay, when Hereford's Ronnie Radford scored the equaliser – a goal still shown regularly when FA Cup fixtures are broadcast.[86] Hereford finished the shocking comeback by defeating Newcastle 2–1 in the match. They finished that season as runners-up of the Southern League, behind Chelmsford City, and were voted into the Football League at the expense of Barrow. Some small clubs gain a reputation for being \"cup specialists\" after two or more giant killing feats within a few years.[80] Yeovil Town hold the record for the most victories over league opposition as a non-league team, having recorded 20 wins through the years before they achieved promotion into The Football League in 2003.[87] The record for a club which has never entered the Football League is held by Altrincham, with 17 wins against league teams. For non-League teams, reaching the third round proper – where all Level 1 sides now enter – is considered a major achievement. In the 2008–09 FA Cup, a record eight non-League teams achieved this feat.[88] As of the 2023–24 season, only eleven non-League teams have reached the fifth round proper (last 16) since 1925,[89] and only Lincoln City have progressed to the quarter-finals (last 8), during the 2016–17 edition of the tournament.[90] Chasetown, while playing at Level 8 of English football during the 2007–08 competition, were the lowest-ranked team to ever play in the third round proper (final 64, of 731 teams entered that season). Chasetown was then a member of the Southern League Division One Midlands (a lower level within the Southern Football League), when they lost to Football League Championship (Level 2) team Cardiff City, the eventual FA Cup runners-up that year.[91] Their success earned the lowly organisation over £60,000 in prize money. Marine matched this in the 2020–21 competition as a member of the Northern Premier League Division One North West, and were drawn against Premier League (Level 1) team Tottenham Hotspur, to whom they lost 5–0. During the 2023–24 season, Maidstone United in the National League South (Level 6) had an 8–game cup run, reaching the fifth round when they won 2–1 away at EFL Championship (Level 2) side Ipswich Town.[92] Their run ended at the fifth round after losing 5–0 away to another EFL Championship side Coventry City.[93] They became the eleventh non–League team to reach the fifth round, and the lowest-ranked team to do so since Blyth Spartans (Level 7) in 1977–78. Maidstone's co–owner Oliver Ash stated that their cup run had earned the club 'something like £700,000 before tax'.[94] Giant-killings can apply to matches between league clubs, particularly where teams from tier 4 have defeated tier 1 sides. In games between League sides, one of the most notable results was the 1992 victory by Wrexham, bottom of the previous season's League (avoiding relegation due to expansion of The Football League), over reigning champions Arsenal. Another similar shock was when Shrewsbury Town beat Everton 2–1 in 2003. Everton finished seventh in the Premier League and Shrewsbury Town were relegated to the Football Conference that same season. During the 2022–23 tournament, Grimsby Town who were 16th in EFL League Two won 2–1 away at Premier League side Southampton to advance into the quarter finals.[95] Since its establishment, the FA Cup has been won by 44 clubs. Teams shown in italics are no longer in existence. Additionally, Queen's Park ceased to be eligible to enter the FA Cup after a Scottish Football Association ruling in 1887.[96] Four clubs have won consecutive FA Cups on more than one occasion: Wanderers (1872, 1873 and 1876, 1877, 1878), Blackburn Rovers (1884, 1885, 1886 and 1890, 1891), Tottenham Hotspur (1961, 1962 and 1981, 1982) and Arsenal (2002, 2003 and 2014, 2015). The record for most titles for a manager is held by Arsène Wenger, who won the FA Cup with Arsenal seven times (1998, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2014, 2015, 2017). Wenger is also the only manager to have won the Cup at the old Wembley Stadium, the Millennium Stadium, and the new Wembley Stadium. Manchester City (2019) are the only club to have achieved a domestic treble of League, FA Cup and League Cup, having beaten Chelsea 4–3 on penalties in the League Cup Final, finished at the top of the Premier League, and beaten Watford 6–0 in the FA Cup Final. Manchester United (1999) and Manchester City (2023) are the only two English teams to have won the continental treble of League, FA Cup, and Champions League. They are two of only nine European sides to do so. Liverpool won the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup in (2001) to complete a cup treble. Eight clubs have won the FA Cup as part of a League and Cup double, namely Preston North End (1889), Aston Villa (1897), Tottenham Hotspur (1961), Arsenal (1971, 1998, 2002), Liverpool (1986), Manchester United (1994, 1996, 1999), Chelsea (2010) and Manchester City (2019, 2023). In 1993, Arsenal became the first side to win both the FA Cup and the League Cup in the same season when they beat Sheffield Wednesday in both finals. Liverpool (2001, 2022), Chelsea (2007) and Manchester City (2019) have since repeated this feat. In 2012, Chelsea won both the FA Cup and the Champions League. The FA Cup has only been won by a non-English team once. Cardiff City achieved this in 1927 when they beat Arsenal in the final at Wembley. They had previously made it to the final only to lose to Sheffield United in 1925 and lost another final to Portsmouth in 2008. Cardiff City are also the only team to win the national cups of two countries in the same season, having also won the Welsh Cup in 1927. The Scottish team Queen's Park reached and lost the final in both 1884 and 1885. Since the creation of the Football League in 1888, the final has never been contested by two teams from outside the top division, and there have only been eight winners who were not in the top flight: Notts County (1894); Tottenham Hotspur (1901); Wolverhampton Wanderers (1908); Barnsley (1912); West Bromwich Albion (1931); Sunderland (1973), Southampton (1976) and West Ham United (1980). With the exception of Tottenham, these clubs were all playing in the second tier (the old Second Division) – Tottenham were playing in the Southern League and were only elected to the Football League in 1908, meaning they are the only non-League winners of the FA Cup since the League's creation. Other than Tottenham's victory, only 24 finalists have come from outside English football's top tier, with a record of 7 wins and 17 runners-up: and none at all from the third tier or lower, Southampton (1902, then in the Southern League) being the last finalist from outside the top two tiers. Sunderland's win in 1973 was considered a major upset, having beaten Leeds United who finished third in the top flight that season,[98] as was West Ham's victory over Arsenal in 1980 as the Gunners were in their third successive FA Cup Final and were the cup holders as well as just having finished 4th in the First Division, whereas West Ham had ended the season 7th in Division 2. This also marked the last time (as of 2023–24) a team from outside the top division won the FA Cup. Uniquely, in 2008 three of the four semi-finalists (Barnsley, Cardiff City and West Bromwich) were from outside the top division, although the eventual winner was the last remaining top-flight team, Portsmouth.[99] West Bromwich (1931) are the only team to have won the FA Cup and earned promotion to the top flight in the same season; whereas Wigan Athletic (2013) are the only team to have won the Cup and been relegated from the top flight in the same season. The FA Cup Final is one of 10 events reserved for live broadcast on UK terrestrial television under the Ofcom Code on Sports and Other Listed and Designated Events. In the early years of coverage the BBC had exclusive radio coverage with a picture of the pitch marked in the Radio Times with numbered squares to help the listener follow the match on the radio. The first FA Cup Final on Radio was in 1926 between Bolton Wanderers and Manchester City but this was only broadcast in Manchester, the first national final on BBC Radio was between Arsenal and Cardiff City in 1927. The first final on BBC Television was in 1937 in a match which featured Sunderland and Preston North End but this was not televised in full. The following season's final between Preston and Huddersfield Town was covered in full by the BBC. When ITV was formed in 1955 they shared final coverage with the BBC in one of the only club matches shown live on television, during the 1970s and 1980s coverage became more elaborate with BBC and ITV trying to steal viewers from the others by starting coverage earlier and earlier some starting as early as 9 a.m. which was six hours before kick off. The sharing of rights between BBC and ITV continued from 1955 to 1988, when ITV lost coverage to the BBC. From 1988 to 1997, the BBC was the exclusive broadcaster of the competition on terrestrial television and covered the competition from the third round onwards, showing one live match per round alongside highlights. In 1990, British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB) obtained rights to the competition, and showed a live match from rounds 1 and 2. This continued to be the case after Sky took over BSB in 1991. From 1997 to 2001, Sky owned the coverage showing one match per round, with the free-to-air rights sublicensed to ITV who showed an additional match from the third round onwards.[100]: 44 The BBC continued with highlights on Match of the Day. From 2001 to 2008, BBC and Sky again shared coverage with BBC having two or three matches per round and Sky having one or two. Until the 2008–09 season, the BBC and Sky Sports shared television coverage, with the BBC showing three matches in the earlier rounds. Some analysts argued the decision to move away from the Sky and, in particular, the BBC undermined the FA Cup in the eyes of the public. From 2008–09 to 2013–14, FA Cup matches were shown live by ITV across England and Wales, with UTV broadcasting to Northern Ireland. Scottish member STV refused to show them, and instead the regularly advertised programming that otherwise would mostly have been shown across the UK (new and repeated network entertainment and drama content, films, local productions etc.) would continue as normal in a delayed or exclusive fashion while the rest of the ITV network aired the football. ITV showed 16 FA Cup games per season, including the first pick of live matches from each of the first to sixth rounds of the competition, plus one semi-final exclusively live. The final was also shown live on ITV. Under the same 2008 contract, Setanta Sports showed three games and one replay in each round from round three to five, two quarter-finals, one semi-final and the final. The channel also broadcast ITV's matches, albeit with their own commentary teams, exclusively to Scotland, after STV's decision to replace the games with regular programming. Setanta entered administration in June 2009 and as a result the FA terminated Setanta's deal to broadcast FA-sanctioned competitions and England internationals.[101] The early rounds of the 2008–09 competition were covered for the first time by ITV's online service, ITV Local. The first match of the competition, between Wantage Town and Brading Town, was broadcast live online. Highlights of eight games of each round were broadcast as catch up on ITV Local.[102][103] Since ITV Local closed, this coverage did not continue. As a result of Setanta going out of business ITV showed the competition exclusively in the 2009–10 season with between three and four matches per round, all quarter finals, semi-finals and final live as the FA could not find a pay TV broadcaster in time. Many expected BSkyB to make a bid to show some of the remaining FA Cup games for the remainder of the 2009–10 season which would include a semi-final and shared rights to the final. In October 2009, The FA announced that ITV would show an additional match in the First and second rounds on ITV, with one replay match shown on ITV4. One match and one replay match from the first two rounds will broadcast on The FA website for free, in a similar situation to the 2010 World Cup Qualifier between Ukraine and England.[104] The 2009–10 first-round match between Oldham Athletic and Leeds United was the first FA Cup match to be streamed online live.[105] ESPN bought the competition for the 2010–11 to 2012–13 season and during this time Rebecca Lowe became the first woman to host the FA Cup Final in the UK. ESPN took over the package Setanta held for the FA Cup from the 2010–11 season.[106] The 2011 final was also shown live on Sky 3D in addition to ESPN (who provided the 3D coverage for Sky 3D) and ITV.[107] Following the sale of ESPN's UK and Ireland channels to BT, ESPN's rights package transferred to BT Sport from the 2013–14 season.[108] STV would continue to broadcast regular programming in place of FA Cup games, live draws and highlights shows throughout this period, although it did the broadcast the 2014 final live. ITV lost the rights to the FA Cup beginning with the 2014–15 FA Cup, terrestrial rights returned to BBC Sport, with the final being shown on BBC One while BT Sport hold the pay TV rights. Under this deal, the BBC will show around the same number of games as ITV and still having the first pick for each round.[109] Matches involving Welsh clubs are sometimes exclusively broadcast on Welsh language channel S4C, which is also available to view across the rest of the United Kingdom on satellite and cable television, and through the channel's website.[110] A similar arrangement is shared with BBC Cymru Wales when the corporation obtained the rights from 2014 to 2015, potentially giving the BBC an extra match per round.[111] On 23 May 2019, it was announced that ITV would replace BT Sport in broadcasting the FA Cup from the 2021–22 season, this new deal will see BBC and ITV become joint broadcasters of the tournament for the first time since 1988, this will mean for the first time that all FA Cup matches would all be exclusively broadcast on free-to-air television.[112] In addition, full coverage of the tournament returned to STV in Scotland, after the broadcaster replaced content from the competition with regular network programmes (as well as local content made in Scotland, plus films and specials) during the 2008 to 2014 period that ITV last held the rights. BBC Radio 5 Live and Talksport provides radio coverage including several full live commentaries per round, with additional commentaries broadcast on BBC Local Radio.",

Everton's FA Cup third-round match against Peterborough on Thursday night is set to go ahead despite icy conditions on Merseyside. The FA Cup third round is here! Here's a look at some of the matches to keep an eye on -- including non-league Tamworth hosting Tottenham -- in England's most prestigious cup competition. The FA Cup third round gets underway on Thursday -- but VAR won't be used in any of the ties.

                "content": "Manage your account The late former President Jimmy Carter will be honored with a national day of mourning Thursday on the same day as a state funeral is planned in Washington, D.C. Services began Saturday to honor Carter, who died Dec. 29 at the age of 100. After lying in repose at the Carter Presidential Center in Georgia, Carter's remains arrived Tuesday in D.C., where he is scheduled to lie in state at the United States Capitol rotunda ahead of funeral services. President Joe Biden declared Jan. 9 as a national day of mourning for Carter, who served one term as U.S. president from 1977 to 1981 before becoming a renowned world humanitarian. Here's what to know about a national day of mourning, including the history of the honor, what it means and what federal agencies will be closed Thursday. When is Jimmy Carter's funeral? See full schedule as remains are transported to DC this week A national day of mourning is a day to honor and pay respects to a revered public figure who has died, most commonly a U.S. president. In the case of Jimmy Carter, the national day of mourning will be held on the same day as the 39th president's funeral at Washington National Cathedral. The most recent president to be honored with a national day of mourning was George H.W. Bush after his death in December 2018. The tradition began in 1865 with a one-day government shutdown six weeks after Abraham Lincoln's assassination, according to the New York Times. While several presidents have been honored with a day of mourning in the subsequent years, others have been commemorated as well. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy were each honored with a national day of mourning after they were assassinated in 1968. President Biden, who will deliver a eulogy at the funeral, has also ordered for U.S. flags to fly at half-staff for Carter for 30 days following his death. The honor is one granted to all sitting or former presidents under a 1954 proclamation signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. For Carter, flags will fly at half-staff – or half-mast, in the case of ships and naval stations – until Jan. 28. That means the flags will still be at half-staff during President-elect Donald Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration. Biden issued an executive order Dec. 30 that “all executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government shall be closed on Jan. 9,” except those necessary for “national security, defense, or other public need.” That means federal employees will have a paid day off. Here's a list of agencies and services that will briefly close for the day: The U.S. Postal Service said post offices will be closed and regular mail will not be delivered Thursday, although a limited number of packages may still be delivered. National parks will generally be open, but their administrative offices will be closed. Those planning to visit a national park site on Thursday are advised to check an individual park’s website for information. However, sites within Jimmy Carter National Historical Park in Plains, Georgia, will have extended hours through Thursday, according to the park service. The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq will close U.S. markets Thursday. The United States Supreme Court and other federal courts, along with the Library of Congress, will all shut down for the day. While most public schools will remain open Thursday because it is not an official federal holiday, all organizations affiliated with the U.S. Department of Defense Education Activity, including all military schools, will be closed.

                "content": "A national day of mourning is a day, or one of several days, marked by mourning and memorial activities observed among the majority of a country's populace. They are designated by the national government. Such days include those marking the death or funeral of a renowned individual or individuals from that country or elsewhere or the anniversary of such a death or deaths, wartime commemorations, or the occurrence or anniversary of a significant disaster either in the country or in another country. Flying a national or military flag of that country at half-mast is a common symbol. Sociologically, period of national mourning are understood \"as instituting states of social exception during which state authorities enact ritual actions consisting in a sequence of choreographically staged performative acts meant to create a national community of grief in the face of what is framed as a socially meaningful loss.\"[1][2][3] The following are lists for national days of mourning across the world: A similar but rarely-used concept exists at the European Union-level and Arab League-level and are called a European Day of Mourning and Arab League Day of Mourning. The European Commission first introduced the concept on 12 September 2001, when a day of mourning was declared across EU member states for the victims of the terrorist attacks in the United States.[11] A second and third day of mourning was held in April 2010 for the victims of Smolensk air disaster in Russia and in November 2015 for the victims of the Paris attacks.[12][13] Arab League has declared days of mourning for four times until October 2023.[14][15] Besides, Other organizations such as African Union, Union of South American Nations etc also announced day of international mourning for several times.[16] While not the same as a national day of mourning, some remembrance events and protests are called a \"day of mourning\".",

                "content": "Success For Each Child & Eliminate the Opportunity Gap by Leading with Racial Equity The National Day of Mourning takes place each year on the fourth Thursday of November, and is a day that provides a respectful counterpoint to Thanksgiving by recognizing that a historical moment may have been assumed to be a joyful occasion on one side, but it was also the catalyst for tragedy on the other. This is why, for many in the Indigenous and Native American community, this date is not a celebrated beginning, but an ending of an era, and an all too brutal reminder of genocide, theft, and centuries of active violence and erasure against our country’s ancient Indigenous culture. Most of all, the day remembers the unjust treatment of the Indigenous and Native American people since that first Plymouth landing in 1620. Commemorated with events, marches, speeches, and protests, the National Day of Mourning honors the deaths of millions while also providing the catharsis of remembrance and spiritual connection – and a call to action against the continued racism and oppression experienced by Indigenous and Native Americans today.

The National School Lunch Program (NSLP) serves nearly 30 million children every school day, providing the essential basic nutrition that contributes to student success and teacher support. President John F. Kennedy created National School Lunch Week (NSLW) in 1962 to promote the importance of a healthy school lunch in a child’s life, as well as the impact a simple school lunch can have both inside and outside the classroom. We are excited to announce the selection of two new student representatives to the Puget Sound Educational Service District (PSESD) Board of Directors. We welcome Maricella Gonzalez from Puyallup High School (Pierce County) and James Young from Mercer Island High School (King County) to the Board this year. Taking place on the second Monday of October each year, Indigenous Peoples Day celebrates the culture and history of the indigenous American peoples in the United States. Former Washington state Governor Chris Gregoire once said \"Show me a great school and I’ll show you a great principal,\" perfectly capturing the spirit of National Principals Month, which takes place each October. Happy #SignLanguagesDay and the International Day of Sign Languages! It's a timely reminder to support greater accessibility to sign language everywhere, to make the world more inclusive for the over 70 million Deaf people across the globe. September 15 marked the anniversary of the day when the last Cherokees arrived in Oklahoma in 1838, and September 16, is the Trail of Tears Remembrance Day. The new Behavior Supports in Schools Collaborative is a multidisciplinary network for Washington’s educational ecosystem. Registration for the first quarterly meeting is now OPEN! Join us virtually this September to build connections with colleagues statewide. September is Suicide Prevention Awareness Month, offering an ideal opportunity to speak out and raise awareness on this vital topic — an awareness that is urgently required, with suicide the tenth leading cause of death among adults in the U.S. — and the second leading cause of death among children and young people aged 10–24. Unfortunately, these rates are increasing, and those who are young, LGBTQ, or BIPOC are especially vulnerable. LGBTQ youth are four times more likely to attempt suicide, while transgender adults, meanwhile, are almost 12 times more likely than the general population to attempt suicide. Celebrated every August 26, Women’s Equality Day provides an essential and poignant remembrance of the passage of women’s suffrage in the U.S. It is also a reminder of the heroic women who suffered violence, torture, death and discrimination as they fought for equal rights for women, including the right to vote. Created by UNESCO to memorialize the horrors of the transatlantic slave trade, Slavery Remembrance Day, also known as International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition, is observed on August 23 worldwide. Upon this day, it's important that we remember that this observance is not only a reminder of the horrors of slavery as we honor its victims—it's also about our dedication across the globe to ensure that slavery, and the racism that caused it, is abolished once and for all. Celebrated each August 14, Navajo Code Talkers Day honors the courageous achievements of the over 400 Navajo men who were recruited to the U.S. Marine Corps during World War II. Unfortunately today, K-12 Education is a declining state priority: Immediately following the McCleary “Solution,” more than half of Washington's general fund budget was dedicated to K-12 education. Since then, K-12 spending in the state’s general fund budget has continued to grow but K-12 education is no longer the funding priority. Commemorating the historic meeting of the first United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations in 1982, International Day of the World’s Indigenous People (August 9) provides us with the chance to promote the rights of Indigenous People worldwide, while also amplifying their voices, cultures, and accomplishments. In these days of increased concern over climate change, the knowledge and commitment of many indigenous peoples to sustainability and biodiversity may in fact prove crucial to protecting the earth for future generations. As a haunting reminder of the destructive power of the atomic bomb, August 6 is Hiroshima Day, when the city of Hiroshima holds the Peace Memorial Ceremony to mourn and commemorate the victims of the detonation of the atomic bomb in that city by the United States on August 6, 1945. Far too often, the history books seem to focus on the men who made the impacts, the men who made the achievements—and then men who looked to the stars. Yet throughout history, the eyes of women have focused on the stars as intensively as men, and to them belong many great achievements and discoveries as they played essential roles in a variety of scientific and astronomical breakthroughs. Which is why, every August 1, we celebrate Women Astronomers Day. © 2022 Puget Sound Educational Service District",

                "title": "Garth Brooks - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Troyal Garth Brooks (born February 7, 1962) is an American country singer and songwriter. His integration of pop and rock elements into the country genre has earned him his immense popularity, particularly in the United States,[2] with success on the country music single and album charts,[3] multi-platinum recordings and record-breaking live performances, while also crossing over into the mainstream pop arena.[4] Brooks is the only artist in music history to have released nine albums that were certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (surpassing The Beatles' former record of six); those albums are Garth Brooks (diamond), No Fences (17× platinum), Ropin' the Wind (14× platinum), The Chase (diamond), In Pieces (diamond), The Hits (diamond), Sevens (diamond), Double Live (21× platinum), and The Ultimate Hits (diamond).[5] Since 1989, Brooks has released 27 records in all, which include 17 studio albums, two live albums, three compilation albums, three Christmas albums, and four box sets, along with 77 singles. He has won several awards in his career, including two Grammy Awards, 17 American Music Awards (including \"Artist of the '90s\") and the RIAA Award for best-selling solo albums artist of the century in the U.S. Troubled by conflicts between career and family, Brooks retired from recording and performing from 2001 until 2005.[4] During this time, he sold millions of albums through an exclusive distribution deal with Walmart and sporadically released new singles.[6][7] In 2005, Brooks started a partial comeback, giving select performances and releasing two compilation albums. In 2009, he began Garth at Wynn, a periodic weekend concert residency at Las Vegas's Encore Theatre from December 2009 to January 2014. Following the conclusion of the residency, Brooks announced his signing with Sony Music Nashville in July 2014.[8] In September 2014, he began his comeback world tour, with wife and musician Trisha Yearwood, which culminated in 2017. This was followed by his Stadium Tour, which began in 2019, and another Las Vegas concert residency, Garth Brooks/Plus ONE, continuing into 2024. His most recent album, Time Traveler, was released in November 2023. Brooks is one of the world's best-selling music artists, having sold more than 170 million records.[9] Billboard ranked Brooks as the greatest male solo artist on the Billboard 200 chart of all time.[10] As of 2020[update], according to the RIAA, he is the best-selling solo albums artist in the United States with 162 million domestic units sold, ahead of Elvis Presley, and is second only to the Beatles in total album sales overall.[11] Brooks was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame on October 21, 2012,[12] having been inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame the year before.[13] He was also inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2016 with his studio musicians, The G-Men.[14] In 2020, Brooks became the youngest recipient of the Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song.[15] Troyal Garth Brooks was born on February 7, 1962, in Tulsa, Oklahoma.[16][1] He was the youngest child of Troyal Raymond Brooks Jr. (1931–2010), a draftsman for an oil company, and Colleen McElroy Carroll (1929–1999), a 1950s-era country singer of Irish[17] ancestry who recorded on the Capitol Records label and appeared on Ozark Jubilee.[18][19][20] This was the second marriage for each of his parents, giving Brooks four older half-siblings (Jim, Jerry, Mike, and Betsy). The couple had two children together, Kelly and Garth.[21] At their home in Yukon, Oklahoma, the family hosted weekly talent nights. All of the children were required to participate, either by singing or doing skits.[22] Brooks learned to play both the guitar and banjo.[23] As a child, Brooks often sang in casual family settings, but his primary focus was athletics. In high school, he played football and baseball and ran track and field. He received a track scholarship to Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, where he competed in the javelin.[20][24] At nights, he worked as a bouncer at a local bar and formed his own band, Santa Fe, learning to play whatever the college audience wanted.[25] Brooks graduated in 1984 with a degree in advertising.[24] His roommate, Ty England, later played guitar in his road band until going solo in 1995.[26] In 1985, Brooks began his professional music career, singing and playing guitar in Oklahoma clubs and bars, most notably Wild Willie's Saloon in Stillwater.[27] Through his elder siblings, Brooks was exposed to a wide range of music. Although he listened to some country music, especially that of George Jones, Brooks was most fond of rock music, citing James Taylor, Dan Fogelberg, and Townes Van Zandt as major influences.[22] In 1981, after hearing \"Unwound\", the debut single of George Strait, Brooks decided that he was more interested in playing country music.[22] In 1985, entertainment attorney Rod Phelps drove from Dallas to listen to Brooks. Phelps liked what he heard and offered to produce Brooks' first demo. With Phelps' encouragement, including a list of Phelps' contacts in Nashville and some of his credit cards, Brooks traveled to Nashville to pursue a recording contract; he returned to Oklahoma within 24 hours.[28] Phelps continued to urge Brooks to return to Nashville, which he did. In 1987, Brooks and wife Sandy Mahl moved to Nashville, and Brooks began making contacts in the music industry. Garth Brooks' eponymous first album was released in 1989 and was a chart success. It peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart, and reached No. 13 on the Billboard 200 chart. Most of the album was traditionalist country, influenced in part by George Strait.[19] The first single, \"Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old)\", was a country top 10 success. It was followed by Brooks' first number-one single on the Hot Country Songs chart, \"If Tomorrow Never Comes\". \"Not Counting You\" reached No. 2, and \"The Dance\" reached No. 1; its music video, directed by John Lloyd Miller, gave Brooks his first push towards a broader audience. Brooks has later claimed that out of all the songs he has recorded, \"The Dance\" remains his favorite.[19] In 1989, Brooks embarked on his first major concert tour, as opening act for Kenny Rogers. Brooks' second album, No Fences, was released in 1990 and spent 23 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart.[29] The album also reached No. 3 on the Billboard 200, and eventually became Brooks' highest-selling album, with domestic shipments of 17 million.[30] It contained what would become Brooks' signature song, the blue collar anthem \"Friends in Low Places\", as well as other popular singles, \"The Thunder Rolls\" and \"Unanswered Prayers\". Each of these songs, as well as \"Two of a Kind, Workin' on a Full House\", reached No. 1 on the Hot Country Songs chart.[19][29] While Brooks' musical style placed him squarely within the boundaries of country music, he was strongly influenced by the 1970s singer-songwriter movement, especially the works of James Taylor, whom he idolized and named his first child after, as well as Dan Fogelberg.[31][32] Similarly, Brooks was influenced by the 1970s-era rock of Billy Joel and Bruce Springsteen and the operatic rock of Queen with Freddie Mercury. In his live shows, Brooks used a wireless headset microphone to free himself to run about the stage, adding energy and arena rock theatrics to spice up the normally staid country music approach to concerts. The band KISS was also one of Brooks' early musical influences, and his shows often reflect this. Despite all the cited influences, Brooks stated the energetic style of his stage persona is directly inspired by Chris LeDoux.[33] In late 1990, Brooks was inducted into the Grand Ole Opry.[34][35] Brooks' third album, Ropin' the Wind, was released in September 1991. It had advance orders of 4 million copies and entered the Billboard 200 at No. 1, a first for a country artist.[18] The album's musical content was a melange of country pop and honky-tonk; singles included \"The River\", \"What She's Doing Now\", and a cover of Billy Joel's \"Shameless\". It would become Brooks' second-best selling album, after No Fences. The success of Ropin' the Wind further propelled the sales of Brooks' first two albums, enabling Brooks to become the first country artist with three albums listed in the Billboard 200's top 20 in one week.[36] After spending time in Los Angeles during the 1992 riots, Brooks co-wrote a gospel-country-rock hybrid single, \"We Shall Be Free\", to express his desire for tolerance.[37] The song became the first single off his fourth album The Chase. The single only reached No. 12 on the Billboard Top Country Singles chart, Brooks' first song in three years to fail to make the top 10.[38][39] Nonetheless, \"We Shall Be Free\" peaked at No. 22 on the Billboard Christian Songs charts through a marketing deal with Rick Hendrix Company, and earned Brooks a 1993 GLAAD Media Award.[40][41] The next single released from The Chase was \"Somewhere Other Than the Night\", followed by \"Learning to Live Again\", which peaked at numbers one and two on the Hot Country Songs chart, respectively. The album's final single, \"That Summer\", would go on to be the most successful single from the album, reaching No. 1 in July 1993.[42] Brooks released his first Christmas album, Beyond the Season on August 25, 1992. The album included classics such as \"White Christmas\" and \"Silent Night\" as well as an original tune \"The Old Man's Back in Town.\" \"Beyond the Season\" was the best selling Christmas album in 1992, peaking at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart.[43] In 1993, Brooks, who had criticized music stores selling used CDs since it led to a loss in proper royalty payments, persuaded Capitol Records to not ship his 1993 album, In Pieces, to stores which engaged in this practice. This led to several antitrust lawsuits against the record label, ending with Capitol shipping the albums to the stores.[44] Despite the delay in shipping, In Pieces was another success, peaking at No. 1 on both the Billboard 200 and Top Country Albums charts, and selling a total of nearly 10 million copies. After a delay in its worldwide release, the album also peaked at No. 2 on the United Kingdom Albums Chart. That same year, \"The Red Strokes\" became Brooks' first single to make the UK Singles Chart, reaching a high of No. 13; it was followed by \"Standing Outside the Fire\", which reached No. 23. Previous albums No Fences, Ropin' the Wind and The Chase also remained in the top 30 in the UK Albums Chart. Brooks' first world tour began in 1993, reaching the UK after many domestic concerts. Brooks sold-out venues such as Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre and London's Wembley Arena, a feat never accomplished by an American country music artist. He also began the London radio station, Country 1035. Despite the disdain of the British media, Brooks' overall popularity in the country was evident, with a top disc jockey, Nick Barraclough, referring to Brooks as Garth Vader (a play on Darth Vader) for his \"invasion\" of the charts and his success in the country genre. Unlike Alan Jackson, who refused to return to the UK after being treated in a similar negative manner by the press, Brooks would later return in 1996 for more performances.[45] Brooks also took his World Tour to other regions throughout Europe, as well as Brazil, Australia, and New Zealand.[45] In 1994, Brooks paid homage to one of his musical influences, KISS, appearing on the tribute compilation, Kiss My Ass: Classic Kiss Regrooved, a collection of songs performed by popular artists from various genres. The unlikely collaboration of Brooks and KISS' rendition of \"Hard Luck Woman\" was performed live on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, and despite its hard-rock appeal, Brooks' version appeared on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. In November 1995, Brooks released Fresh Horses, his first album of new material in two years. Within six months of its release, the album had sold over three million copies. Despite its promising start, Fresh Horses plateaued quickly, topping out at quadruple platinum.[46] The album's lead single, \"She's Every Woman\" peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart; however, its follow-up single, \"The Fever\" (an Aerosmith cover) only peaked at No. 23, becoming Brooks' first country single to not chart on the top 10. However, Brooks had three additional top 10 singles from the album, including \"The Beaches of Cheyenne\", which reached No. 1.[47] Following the release of Fresh Horses, Brooks embarked on his second world tour. Its total attendance, approximately 5.5 million, ranks third on the all-time list of concert attendance, and its gross of over $105 million ranks it among the highest-grossing concert tours in the 1990s.[48] In 1997, Brooks released his seventh studio album, Sevens. The album was originally scheduled to be released in August 1997, allowing for promotion during Brooks' Central Park concert; however, plans went awry after a dispute within Capitol Records.[46] The Central Park concert went on as planned, receiving 980,000 fans in attendance and becoming the largest concert in park history.[49] Sevens debuted at No. 1 on both the Billboard 200 and Top Country Albums charts. It later became Brooks' fourth album to reach sales of 10 million copies. The album included the duet \"In Another's Eyes\" with Trisha Yearwood, which reached No. 2 on Hot Country Songs chart, and its first single, \"Longneck Bottle\", with Steve Wariner, reached No. 1. The album spawned two additional number-one singles, \"Two Pina Coladas\" and \"To Make You Feel My Love\" (a Bob Dylan cover), which also was a top 10 hit on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart and was released on the soundtrack to the film, Hope Floats. Brooks' first live album, Double Live was released in 1998. Recorded at various shows over the course of his second world tour, the album contained new material not previously released, such as \"Tearin' It Up (and Burnin' It Down)\" and \"Wild as the Wind,\" featuring Trisha Yearwood. Peaking at No. 1 on both the Billboard 200 and Top Country Albums charts, Double Live went on to become the best-selling live album of all time, certified 21× Platinum by the RIAA, and is the seventh-most shipped album in United States music history.[50] In 1998, Brooks also released the first installment of The Limited Series, a six-disc box set containing reissues of his first six studio albums. Each of the reissued albums included a bonus track not available on the original release. In 1999, Brooks took on the persona of \"Chris Gaines\", a fictitious rock-and-roll musician and character for an upcoming film titled The Lamb. In October 1999, the film's pre-release soundtrack, Garth Brooks in...the Life of Chris Gaines (also dubbed Gaines' Greatest Hits), was released to much public criticism. Brooks also appeared as Gaines in a television mockumentary for the VH1 series Behind the Music, and as the musical guest on an episode of Saturday Night Live, which he also hosted as himself. Brooks' promotion of the album and the film did not garner excitement, and the failure of the Gaines project was evident mere weeks after the album was released. The majority of the American public was either bewildered, or completely unreceptive to the idea of Brooks portraying a rock-and-roll musician.[51] Sales of the album were unspectacular, at least compared with most of Brooks' previous albums, and although it made it to No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart, expectations had been higher and retail stores began heavily discounting their oversupply.[52] Less-than-expected sales of the album (more than two million) brought the project to an indefinite hiatus in February 2001 and Gaines quickly faded into obscurity.[53] Despite the less-than-spectacular response to the Gaines project, Brooks gained his first (and only) Billboard Top 40 pop single in \"Lost in You\". The album was later certified Double Platinum by the RIAA. On November 23, 1999, Brooks released his second holiday album, Garth Brooks & the Magic of Christmas. The album peaked at No. 7 on Billboard's Top 200 and No. 1 on the Top Country Albums, making it Brooks' 10th number-one album.[54] As his career flourished, Brooks seemed frustrated by the conflicts between career and family. He first talked of retiring from performing in 1992, and again in 1995, but each time returned to touring.[38] In 1999, Brooks appeared on The Nashville Network's Crook & Chase program, again mentioning retirement in a more serious tone.[55] On October 26, 2000, Brooks officially announced his retirement from recording and performing.[56] Later that evening, Capitol Records noted Brooks' achievement of selling 100 million albums in the US, celebrating at Nashville's Gaylord Entertainment Center.[57] Brooks' final album before retirement, Scarecrow, was released on November 13, 2001. The album did not match the sales levels of Brooks' heyday, but still sold well, reaching No. 1 on Billboard 200 and Top Country Albums charts. Although he staged a few performances for promotional purposes, Brooks stated that he would be retired from recording and performing at least until his youngest daughter finished high school.[56] In 2005, Brooks expressed his interest in returning to live performances; however, he remained adamant to the premise of not releasing new music until 2014. Despite this, later that year, Brooks signed a deal with Walmart, leasing them the rights to his entire catalog following his split with Capitol Records.[58][59] Brooks was one of the first musicians to sign an exclusive music distribution deal with a single retailer (along with fellow country music artist Ricky Van Shelton, who issued his 1998 album Making Plans through the chain as well).[58][60] Three months later, in November 2005, Brooks and Walmart issued an updated The Limited Series compilation, a box set containing reissues of Brooks' albums, including Double Live, and The Lost Sessions, featuring eleven previously unreleased recordings. The box set sold more than 500,000 physical copies on its issue date. By the first week in December 2005, it had sold over 1 million physical copies.[6] Brooks took a brief break from retirement early in 2005 to perform in various benefit concerts. He also released a new single, \"Good Ride Cowboy\", as a tribute to his late friend and country singer, Chris LeDoux, via Walmart.[7] In early 2006, Walmart reissued The Lost Sessions as a single CD apart from the box set, with additional songs, including a duet with Trisha Yearwood, \"Love Will Always Win\", which reached the top 25 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart.[61] The couple were later nominated for a \"Best Country Collaboration With Vocals\" Grammy Award. On August 18, 2007, Brooks announced plans for a new box set, The Ultimate Hits. The new set featured two discs containing 30 classic songs, three new songs, and a DVD featuring music videos. The album's first single, \"More Than a Memory\", was released on August 27, 2007. It debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, becoming the highest-debuting single in the chart's history.[62] In November 2007, Brooks embarked on Garth Brooks: Live in Kansas City, performing nine sold-out concerts in Kansas City at the Sprint Center, which had opened a month prior. Originally scheduled to be only one show, the performance expanded to nine due to incredibly high demand, with all nine shows (equaling about 140,000 tickets) selling out in under two hours.[63] The final concert of the series was simulcast to more than 300 movie theaters across the U.S. In January 2008, Brooks embarked on another incredible feat performing five sold-out shows (in less than 48 hours) at the Staples Center in Los Angeles for a fundraiser towards the 2007 wildfires season that impacted much of Southern California's cities and counties. The first concert (of the five) titled Garth Brooks: Live in LA was taped and broadcast repeatedly on CBS with all donations going to all of the victims and families in state of California who were impacted by the fires. In January 2009, Brooks made another one of few public appearances since his retirement, performing at the We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial concert in Washington, D.C.. In his three-song set, Brooks performed \"We Shall Be Free\", along with covers of Don McLean's \"American Pie\" and the Isley Brothers' \"Shout\". On October 15, 2009, Brooks suspended his retirement to begin Garth at Wynn, a periodic weekend concert residency at Encore Las Vegas on the Las Vegas Strip. The schedule allowed Brooks both to have the family life during the week and to continue to perform on the weekend. The financial terms of the agreement were not announced, but Steve Wynn did disclose that he gave Brooks access to a private jet to quickly transport him between Las Vegas and his home in Oklahoma.[64] Brooks' first weekend on shows in Vegas received positive reviews and was called the \"antithesis of Vegas glitz and of the country singer's arena and stadium extravaganzas\" by USA Today. The shows featured Brooks performing solo, acoustic concerts, and included a set list of songs that have influenced him. Artists covered in the show include Simon and Garfunkel, Bob Seger, Billy Joel, and Don McLean. His first performances at Encore Las Vegas coincided with his wedding anniversary, and his wife Trisha Yearwood joined him for two songs. In 2013, influenced by the set list of the Las Vegas shows, Brooks released Blame It All on My Roots: Five Decades of Influences via Walmart, a compilation album consisting of songs Brooks attributes to the development of his unique country pop genre. The box set's albums were individually certified Platinum and the compilation received a Billboard Music Award nomination. In a December 2013 appearance on Good Morning America to promote the album, Brooks also surprisingly announced plans for a world tour, beginning in 2014.[65] In February 2014, Brooks announced two concerts at Croke Park, Dublin, Ireland, to be held on July 25 and 26, 2014. Due to high demand, three additional shows were added, and a total of 400,000 tickets were sold.[66] However, due to licensing conflict, Aiken Promotions and Croke Park management were prompted to cancel two of the five concerts after conflict among nearby residents.[67] Brooks, committed to performing the five original concerts, refused to follow through with the request to only perform three, and all concerts were cancelled.[68] On July 10, 2014, Brooks held a press conference where he announced his signing with Sony Music Nashville, as well as confirming plans for a new album, world tour, the release of his music in a digital format, and remorse for the Ireland concert controversy.[8] Fifteen days later, tickets first went on sale for the world tour. On September 3, 2014, Brooks released his comeback single, \"People Loving People\", in promotion of his world tour and new album, Man Against Machine. The song debuted onto the Nielsen BDS-driven Country Airplay chart at No. 19, tying for the third-highest debut of Brooks' career.[69][70][71] On September 4, 2014, Brooks released his entire studio output on digital for the first time ever. Bypassing traditional digital music service providers, Brooks opted into releasing his albums directly his own new online music store, GhostTunes.[72] On September 19, Brooks confirmed the release date for his next album, scheduled for November 11 via a press conference in Atlanta. Man Against Machine was released via Pearl and RCA Nashville and was available online exclusively through GhostTunes.[73] GhostTunes closed on March 3, 2017. Brooks' digital catalogue moved to Amazon Music, who maintain exclusive rights over it. In September 2015, it was announced Brooks would reissue his album No Fences later in the year to commemorate its 25-year release anniversary. The release would include a new version of \"Friends in Low Places\", featuring George Strait, Jason Aldean, Florida Georgia Line, and Keith Urban singing along with Brooks. The album release has since been delayed due to royalty disputes.[74] The track was later featured on his 2016 compilation album, The Ultimate Collection. On October 13, 2016, Brooks released the first single, \"Baby, Let's Lay Down and Dance\", from his upcoming album.[75] The following week, Brooks released the upcoming album's title, Gunslinger, via Facebook Live.[76] It was released on November 11, 2016, as a part of The Ultimate Collection, a compilation album Brooks released through Target. Brooks' other project for 2016 was a duet holiday album with wife Trisha Yearwood, Christmas Together.[77] After years of royalty disputes and an opposition to online music streaming, Brooks launched a streaming channel on Sirius XM Radio.[78] He also reached an agreement to stream his entire catalogue via Amazon Music.[79] On June 19, 2018, Brooks released a new single, \"All Day Long\", the first off his 2020 album, Fun. The release also included a B-side, \"The Road I'm On\".[80] In August 2018, Brooks announced new live album, Triple Live, to be released in partnership with Ticketmaster.[81] In August 2018, Brooks announced his Stadium Tour, which will visit thirty North American stadiums and showcase Brooks in a football-centric environment.[82] In promotion of the tour, Brooks performed the first concert at the University of Notre Dame's football stadium in 2018[83] He released the second single, \"Stronger Than Me\", from his upcoming 2019 album release following a performance dedicated to his wife Trisha Yearwood at the CMA Awards.[84] On August 14, 2021, he performed his largest ever ticketed concert at Memorial Stadium in Lincoln, Neb., selling 90,000 tickets.[85] The third single from his upcoming album, \"Dive Bar\", a duet with Blake Shelton, was released in June 2019.[86] Brooks also embarked on the Dive Bar Tour, a promotional tour in support of the single, visiting seven dive bars throughout the United States.[87] During the COVID-19 pandemic, Brooks and wife Trisha Yearwood performed an informal concert broadcast on Facebook Live. The website crashed multiple times as an estimated 5.2 million streamed the broadcast. As a result of this, Brooks and Yearwood performed a concert in the same format the following week, broadcast live on CBS, along with a donation of $1 million to relief efforts.[88] The CBS special scored an estimated 5.6 million viewers.[89] On July 7, Brooks and Yearwood performed a \"part 2\" to their previous online concert, taking song requests and again broadcast on Facebook Live.[90] On June 27, 2020, Brooks performed a concert broadcast at 300 drive-in theaters throughout North America.[91] Brooks released his most recent album, Fun, on November 20, 2020.[92] On January 20, 2021, Brooks performed \"Amazing Grace\" at the inauguration of Joe Biden.[93] He said his performance was an opportunity \"to serve\" and is a \"statement of unity.\"[94][95] On April 30, 2022, Brooks performed in Tiger Stadium on the campus of Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. When he performed his signature hit \"Callin' Baton Rouge,\" he became the second person, after LSU quarterback Tommy Hodson, to excite the crowd to a degree that the noise level registered on the university's seismograph – registering as an earthquake caused by excited fans.[96] On November 14, 2022, Brooks announced his second concert residency, Garth Brooks/Plus ONE, at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.[97] He released his most recent album, Time Traveler, in November 2023.[98] On November 24, 2023, Brooks headlined an Amazon Music Live concert special, Garth Brooks: Dive Bar Concert. The concert took place at Brooks' Nashville bar Friends in Low Places Bar & Honky-Tonk.[99] On January 9, 2025, Brooks along with his wife Trisha Yearwood performed the John Lennon song \"Imagine\" at the state funeral for former President Jimmy Carter at the Washington National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. [100] The vast majority of Brooks' recordings have used the same studio band, known collectively as the \"G-Men\". These are Bruce Bouton (steel guitar), Mark Casstevens (acoustic guitar), Mike Chapman (bass guitar), Rob Hajacos (fiddle), Milton Sledge (drums), and Bobby Wood (keyboards), along with sound engineer Mark Miller, who took over from Allen Reynolds as Brooks' producer starting with Blame It All on My Roots: Five Decades of Influences.[101] Chapman died on June 13, 2016.[102] In 1998, Brooks launched his Touch 'em All Foundation with Major League Baseball. He also began with a short career in baseball, when he signed with the San Diego Padres for spring training in 1998 and 1999.[103] Brooks' performance on the field did not warrant management placing him on the regular season roster; however, he was offered a non-roster spot, but declined it.[104] The following season, Brooks signed with the New York Mets. This spring-training stint was also a poor performance for Brooks, resulting in a zero-for-seventeen batting record.[105] In 2004, Brooks returned to baseball with the Kansas City Royals.[106] He got his first and only hit off Mike Myers during his final spring training game with the Royals.[107] In 2019, Brooks made a return to spring training, joining the Pittsburgh Pirates to promote his charity.[108] In 2005, Brooks ended his association with Capitol Records and established his own record label, Pearl Records.[109] Brooks has released four compilation albums via Pearl Records, as well as his 2014 and 2016 studio albums plus any future releases (also released through RCA Records Nashville). In 2010, Brooks purchased Jack's Tracks, a recording studio founded by Jack Clement in 1971 and sold to Allen Reynolds in 1975, where most of Brooks' albums were recorded. In 2012, in honor of his 50th birthday, Brooks renamed the studio Allentown Studios.[110][111] In September 2014, Brooks established GhostTunes, an online music store featuring his own digital music, as well as over ten million songs from other artists. The store, contracted with \"the big three\" record labels, allows for autonomous pricing and distribution format, resulting in the most proper royalty payments for artists and songwriters.[112] In March 2017, GhostTunes officially closed, merging with Amazon Music.[113] Brooks graduated from Oklahoma State University where he starred on the track and field team in the javelin throw. He later completed his MBA from Oklahoma State and participated in the commencement ceremony on May 6, 2011.[114] Brooks married songwriter Sandy Mahl on May 24, 1986. The couple had three daughters: Taylor Mayne Pearl (b. 1992), August Anna (b. 1994), and Allie Colleen Brooks (b. 1996).[115][116] Brooks and Mahl separated in March 1999, announcing their plans to divorce on October 9, 2000, and filed for divorce on November 6, 2000.[57][117] The divorce became final on December 17, 2001.[117][118] Brooks remarried on December 10, 2005, to country singer and cookbook author Trisha Yearwood.[20][24] Yearwood has included various recipes created or inspired by Brooks in her published works, including Garth's Breakfast Bowl, a breakfast dish including cheese and garlic tortellini.[119] In July 2013, Brooks became a grandfather when August had daughter Karalynn with Chance Michael Russell.[120] In 1999, Brooks began the Teammates for Kids Foundation, which provides financial aid to charities for children.[121] The organization breaks down into three categories spanning three different sports: Brooks is also a fundraiser for various other charities, including a number of children's charities and famine relief. With wife Trisha Yearwood, Brooks sang Creedence Clearwater Revival's \"Who'll Stop the Rain\" on the Shelter from the Storm: A Concert for the Gulf Coast nationwide telethon for Hurricane Katrina relief.[122] He performed the Garth Brooks: Live in LA benefit concerts, five sold-out concerts over a two-day period at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California on January 25 and 26, 2008 (setting numerous records at the high-profile venue in the process and accomplished a feat done by no other artist in music history to perform all 5 shows in a 48-hour time frame). These concerts were staged to raise money for Fire Intervention Relief Effort, serving those impacted by the 2007 California wildfires. Tickets were priced at $40 each and all five shows (totaling more than 85,000 tickets) sold out in 58 minutes. CBS broadcast the first concert live as a telethon for additional fundraising.[123] Brooks, along with wife Yearwood, has supported Habitat for Humanity's work over the years. In December 2010, Brooks played nine shows in less than a week in Nashville at Bridgestone Arena to benefit victims from the May 2010 Nashville flood. Over 140,000 tickets were sold and $5 million raised.[124] On July 6, 2013, Brooks joined with Toby Keith for a benefit concert for victims of the 2013 Oklahoma tornadoes. The sold-out show featured artists Mel Tillis, John Anderson, Willie Nelson, Trisha Yearwood, Sammy Hagar, Kellie Coffey, Ronnie Dunn, Carrie Underwood and Krystal Keith. It was held at Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium.[125] Most recently, while between legs of his world tour in 2015, Brooks performed a sold-out concert in Barretos, Brazil to benefit the Hospital de Câncer de Barretos.[126] In a 1999 interview with George, Brooks said, \"But if you're in love, you've got to follow your heart and trust that God will explain to us why we sometimes fall in love with people of the same sex.\"[127][128] Lyrics to his song, \"We Shall Be Free\", features the line, \"When we're free to love anyone we choose,\" which has been interpreted as a reference to same-sex relationships.[127] Brooks won a 1993 GLAAD Media Award for the song. In 2000, Brooks appeared at the Equality Rocks benefit concert for gay rights. He sang a duet with openly gay singer George Michael.[129] Brooks' half-sister, Betsy Smittle, who died in 2013, was a musician who released her own album Rough Around the Edges (as Betsy) and was part of Brooks' band for some years. She also worked with the late country star Gus Hardin and other musicians in Tulsa. Smittle was a lesbian, and Brooks has credited her with some of the inspiration for his support for same-sex marriage.[130][131] In October 2024, Brooks was sued by his former hairstylist and makeup artist who claimed she was sexually harassed by him on several occasions. She also claimed that Brooks raped her during a trip the two took to film a Grammy tribute in 2019.[132] Brooks has denied the allegations, calling them a \"shakedown\" and an extortion attempt. He initially sued his accuser under a pseudonym in an attempt to block the allegations from coming to light.[133] In response to the lawsuit naming him, Brooks named his accuser in a countersuit.[134][135] Brooks has won a record 22 Academy of Country Music Awards and received a total of 47 overall nominations. His 13 Grammy Award nominations have resulted in 2 awards won, along with Billboard Music Awards, Country Music Association Awards, and many others. Brooks' work has earned awards and nominations in television and film as well, including the Primetime Emmy Awards and Golden Globe Awards. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2012. In 2010, he was inducted into the Cheyenne Frontier Days Hall of Fame.[136] He has also been inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame,[13] and the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum.[14] In 2020, Brooks was awarded the Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song. Age 57 at the time he was named as the Gershwin honoree, he is the youngest recipient of the award.[15] Also in 2020, Cher presented Brooks with the Billboard Icon Award.[137] In 2021, Brooks was named a recipient for the 43rd Annual Kennedy Center Honors.[138] According to the Recording Industry Association of America, Brooks was the best-selling solo artist of the 20th century in America.[139] This conclusion drew criticism from the press and many music fans who were convinced that Elvis Presley had sold more records, but had been short-changed in the rankings due to faulty RIAA certification methods during his lifetime.[140][141] Brooks, while proud of his sales accomplishments, stated that he too believed that Presley must have sold more.[140] The RIAA has since reexamined their methods for counting certifications. Under their revised methods, Presley became the best-selling solo artist in U.S. history, making Brooks the number-two solo artist, ranking third overall, as the Beatles have sold more albums than either he or Presley.[142] The revision brought more criticism of the accuracy of the RIAA's figures, this time from Brooks' followers. On November 5, 2007, Brooks was again named the best selling solo artist in US history, surpassing Presley after audited sales of 123 million were announced.[143] In December 2010, several more of Presley's albums received certifications from the RIAA. As a result, Elvis again surpassed Brooks.[144] As of October 2014[update], the RIAA lists Presley's total sales at 134.5 million and Brooks' at 134 million.[145] Subsequently, Man Against Machine has been certified by the RIAA as Platinum and listing Brooks sales as exceeding 136 million, placing Brooks again as the number 1 selling solo artist. In 2012, Brooks officially passed the Beatles as the top-selling act of the past 20 years, moving 68.5 million units worldwide, almost 5 million more than the Beatles.[146] In May 2014, Brooks' total album sales reached 69,544,000 copies, which makes him the best-selling album artist in the U.S., ahead of the Beatles (65,730,000), Metallica (54,365,000), Mariah Carey (54,280,000) and Celine Dion (52,234,000).[147] In September 2016, Brooks became the first and only artist in music history to achieve seven career Diamond Award albums, according to the RIAA (surpassing the previous tied record of six next to The Beatles).[148] On June 16, 2021, Brooks won the Pollstar award as the \"country touring artist of the decade\" (2010s). Brooks thanked his band for the companionship during all those years.[149] In 2014, Brooks was awarded the Arkansas Traveler certificate.[150] †Honorary former member; was scheduled to be invited, but died before the invitation was extended",

He uses rock elements in his recordings and live performances. Brooks was successful in the country singles and country album charts and later also proved popular in the mainstream pop arena, exposing country music to a larger audience.[1] Brooks has had one of the most successful careers in popular music history, with over 70 hit singles and 15 charted albums to his credit. Throughout the 1990s he broke records for both sales and concert attendance. In 1999, looking to expand his career boundaries, Brooks began a multimedia project involving a fictitious alter ego known as Chris Gaines. He started performing at bars while studying advertising in college and also working as a bouncer.[2] In 2001, Brooks officially retired from recording and performing, after having conflicts between his career and family.[1] During this time he has sold millions of albums through an exclusive distribution deal with Walmart and has released new singles from time to time.[3][4] On November 6, 2007, The Ultimate Hits was released. Brooks came out of retirement in 2007 when he opened a new arena in Kansas City, Missouri.[5] He left retirement again in 2013 to play at the Encore Casino in Las Vegas.[5]",

                "content": "Garth Brooks just completed the three-and-a-half-year-long Stadium Tour. It drew an average of more than 95,000 people in each city it played and was seen by a cumulative audience of nearly three million people. The tour ended in September when Garth played the fifth sold-out concert at Dublin, Ireland’s Croke Park. The five concerts were seen by over 400,000 people. Also in September, Garth was honored with the Kris Kristofferson Lifetime Achievement Award at the NSAI's Nashville Songwriter Awards, held at the Ryman Auditorium. In May 2021, Garth Brooks received one of the most prestigious honors an artist can receive, The Kennedy Center Honor. He remains the #1-selling solo artist in U.S. history, certified by the RIAA with 157 million album sales. Brooks is the first and only artist in history to receive nine RIAA Diamond Awards for the now nine albums certified at over 10 million. Brooks is the first-ever seven-time recipient of the CMA Entertainer of the Year award. Recently, he was awarded Country Touring Artist of the Decade at the 2021 Pollstar Awards. In March 2020, Brooks received the esteemed Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song. He has received nearly every accolade the recording industry can bestow on an artist and is a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame, the Songwriters Hall of Fame, the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, the Musicians Hall of Fame, and the Grand Ole Opry. In November 2020, just after receiving the Billboard Music Icon Award, Brooks released two new albums, his 12th studio album, FUN, and Triple Live Deluxe. On sale now is The Anthology, Part II: The Next Five Years. In this anthology, Garth picks up where he left off in The Anthology, Part I: The First Five Years, telling his story in his own words and offering fascinating insights to his career and personal life from 1996-2001. Brooks has 20 Billboard #1 singles to his credit. In March 2020, Billboard announced that he was the first artist to garner top-5 singles at country radio (across Billboard and Mediabase charts) across five consecutive decades--the 80s, 90s, 00s, 10s and 20s. His run on the airplay charts began with his first single, \"Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old)\" in 1989 and has continued most recently with \"Dive Bar,\" his duet with Blake Shelton. During that time, his music has filled the radio airwaves with timeless classics that earned a place in the American songbook, including “The Dance,” “Friends in Low Places,” “The River,” and “If Tomorrow Never Comes.” In November of 2019, A&E aired Garth Brooks: The Road I'm On over two consecutive nights. Part of A&E's esteemed 'Biography' franchise, the documentary offered an intimate look at Garth's life as a musician and father over his entire career. In 2019 Brooks released his first vinyl package, THE LEGACY COLLECTION, including three boxed sets--The Limited, Original Analog, and Remixed/Remastered Editions. Each box contains seven vinyl albums and seven CDs with bonus tracks. This is the first-ever, multi-album offering of Triple Live, No Fences, In Pieces, The Chase, and Fresh Horses. Buyers ordered their LEGACY COLLECTION with their unique 6-digit number, commemorating a special date, on each box, making it a one-of-a-kind collection. During the first pre-sale for the collection, Garth smashed records with 20,000 packages sold in under 18 hours. That's 420,000 vinyl records! The second 24-hour pre-sale window saw people secure an additional 300,000 vinyl albums. “To put this in context,” Forbes noted, “The Beatles were the number-one vinyl artist in 2018 with 321,000 sales over 12 months.” In 2017, Garth finished the three-and-a-half-year-long Garth Brooks World Tour with Trisha Yearwood. The tour sold over 6.3 million tickets, making it the biggest North American tour in history. Garth also has Inside Studio G, a weekly Facebook Live series.

                "content": "Country music legend Garth Brooks, who sings “Friends in Low Places,” has sold more albums than any other solo artist in U.S. history. Country music star Garth Brooks has been accused of rape and sexual assault in a new lawsuit from a former employee. The anonymous woman, identified only as Jane Roe, worked as Brooks’ hair and makeup stylist starting in 2017. In the lawsuit, filed in California on October 3, she states Brooks subjected her to unwanted sexual advances several times in 2019 and raped her in a Los Angeles hotel room that year. The woman also accuses Brooks of attempting to cover up the alleged harassment by deleting texts from her phone and filing a preemptive legal complaint against her. In a statement also from October 3, the 62-year-old musician admitted to anonymously filing the complaint in September but denied the allegations of abuse against him. “For the last two months, I have been hassled to no end with threats, lies, and tragic tales of what my future would be if I did not write a check for many millions of dollars,” Brooks said. “Hush money, no matter how much or how little, is still hush money. In my mind, that means I am admitting to behavior I am incapable of—ugly acts no human should ever do to another.” Garth Brooks is a Grammy-winning country music star known the songs “Friends in Low Places,” “The Dance,” and “If Tomorrow Never Comes.” His third studio effort, Ropin’ the Wind, was the first country album to debut at No. 1 on the mainstream Billboard 200 chart. He is the only artist in history to have won seven CMA Entertainer of the Year awards and to have eight diamond-certified albums, having sold at least 10 million copies each. FULL NAME: Troyal Garth BrooksBORN: February 7, 1962BIRTHPLACE: Tulsa, OklahomaSPOUSES: Sandy Mahl (1986-2001) and Trisha Yearwood (2005-present)CHILDREN: Taylor, August, and AllieASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Aquarius Troyal Garth Brooks, better known as Garth Brooks, was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on February 7, 1962. His father, Troyal Raymond Brooks Jr., worked for an oil company, and his mother, Colleen McElroy Carroll, was a country singer. He grew up with four older half-siblings—Jim, Jerry, Mike, and Betsy—as well as his older sister Kelly. His brother Mike taught Garth how to play guitar, spawning his path to becoming a musician. To start, Brooks sang in bars and clubs while attending Oklahoma State University. In 1987, he moved to Nashville, Tennessee, but struggled to get his career off the ground. He worked at a local boot store to make ends meet. With help from music manager Bob Doyle, Brooks signed to Capitol Records in 1988 and released his self-titled first album the following year. His early hits include “If Tomorrow Never Comes” and “The Dance.” Although sales for the singer’s first album, Garth Brooks (1989), were good, it would have been hard to predict the amazing success of later releases. His second effort, No Fences, released in August 1990 and spent 23 weeks at No. 1 on Billboard’s Top Country Albums chart thanks to his bar anthem “Friends in Low Places” and “The Thunder Rolls,” among other hits. Within a year, No Fences had sold more than 4 million copies before becoming Brooks’ first diamond-certified album in May 1993. According to the most recent sales data, from February 2020, the album has now sold the equivalent of 18 million copies. His third album, Ropin’ the Wind, raked in a record-breaking four million orders before its release in September 1991 and became the first album by a country singer to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. His 1998 release, Garth Brooks Double Live, sold over one million copies in its first week of sales, breaking the previous record. The singer-songwriter’s other hit albums have included The Chase (1992), In Pieces (1993), Fresh Horses (1995), Sevens (1997), and Scarecrow (2001). Brooks’ live concerts have also been extremely successful. An August 7, 1997, concert in New York City’s Central Park drew an estimated 850,000 to 1.2 million people. In 2009, Brooks accepted a three-year stint for a string of performances at the Wynn Las Vegas. The intimate performances Brooks gave—his set only featured himself and his guitar, as he shared personal life experiences and the importance of his family—resonated with audiences and proved to be a huge success for the artist. The country star played sold-out shows throughout the entirety of his residency. In 2011, he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the following year, he became a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame. He was inducted by George Strait, James Taylor, and Bob Seger. For his final show at the Wynn Las Vegas in November 2013, Brooks partnered with CBS for a live broadcast event. The TV special received 9.33 million viewers and claimed the No. 1 spot in the ratings for the night. Years later, the singer inked a record contract with Sony Music Nashville for his first studio album since 2001’s Scarecrow. The album, Man Against Machine, came out in November 2014. In late 2016, Brooks debuted two new projects: his 10th studio album, Gunslinger, as well as a collaboration with his wife Trisha Yearwood on a collection of holiday standards, Christmas Together. The couple hit the road on the Garth Brooks World Tour with Trisha Yearwood. The tour lasted three and a half years and sold over 6.3 million tickets, making it one of the biggest North American tour’s in history. In March 2019, Brooks returned to the road on The Garth Brooks Stadium Tour and was later honored with the Entertainer of the Year Award at the Country Music Association Awards for a record seventh time. That year, he also received iHeart Radio’s inaugural Artist of the Decade Award at the iHeart Radio Awards. Just after receiving Billboard’s Music Icon Award, Brooks released his long awaited album Fun in November 2020 after experiencing production delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic. His most recent album, Time Traveler, came out in November 2023. The singer’s 14th﻿ studio album was sold as part of a seven-disc boxed set exclusively at Bass Pro Shops. After completing his three-and-a-half year Stadium Tour, Brooks returned to Las Vegas to begin a Plus One residency at The Colosseum in Caesar’s Palace in May 2023. The residency is expected to conclude in March 2025. A&E Network’s genre-defining, Emmy Award–winning Biography franchise released the two-part definitive documentary highlighting the prolific career of Brooks, the best-selling solo artist of all time. Garth Brooks: The Road I’m On﻿ premiered over two consecutive nights in early December 2019. The documentary offered an intimate look into Brooks’ life as a musician, father, and man as well as the moments that have defined his decade-spanning career and essential hit songs. Garth Brooks: The Road I’m On chronicled Brooks’ life and career from his early days playing gigs at college bars in Oklahoma and his first unsuccessful trip to Nashville to his record-breaking world tours and balancing family life with global fame. The special highlighted the deeply personal journey and profound legacy of a genre-defining musical figure for the first time. In addition to exclusive interviews with Brooks as he told his life story for the first time, the documentary featured never-before-seen interviews with Trisha Yearwood, Billy Joel﻿, Keith Urban﻿, George Strait﻿, James Taylor﻿, friend and original bandmate Ty England, songwriter Tony Arata, as well as many others from Brooks’ personal and musical family. The documentary also showcased unprecedented access to the seven-time CMA Entertainer of the Year’s current record-setting stadium tour and delved into the stories behind his then-eight diamond-certified albums. “If I was ever going to do a documentary on my life and music, I wanted A&E to do it,” Brooks said. “They have interviewed all of the people who would know what the true stories are so no matter how this turns out, I can’t say it isn’t the truth.” ﻿ Brooks and country singer Trisha Yearwood first crossed paths during a demo recording in 1987. A decade later, the pair collaborated on the 1997 song “In Another’s Eyes,” which later earned them a Grammy. Brooks and Yearwood wen public with their romance in June 2002 when they made their red carpet debut at the Songwriters Hall of Fame. The couple got engaged in May 2005 and married seven months later in December. Brooks was previously married to songwriter Sandy Mahl, with whom he shares three children: Taylor, August, and Allie. The couple separated in 1999, nearly 10 years after their 1986 wedding. At the end of 2000, Brooks announced he was taking a break from music to spend more time with his daughters. His divorce from Mahl was finalized the following year. The Biography.com staff is a team of people-obsessed and news-hungry editors with decades of collective experience.

                "title": "Venezuela - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Venezuela,[c] officially the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,[d] is a country on the northern coast of South America, consisting of a continental landmass and many islands and islets in the Caribbean Sea. It comprises an area of 916,445 km2 (353,841 sq mi), and its population was estimated at 29 million in 2022.[18] The capital and largest urban agglomeration is the city of Caracas. The continental territory is bordered on the north by the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, on the west by Colombia, Brazil on the south, Trinidad and Tobago to the north-east and on the east by Guyana. Venezuela is a presidential republic consisting of 23 states, the Capital District and federal dependencies covering Venezuela's offshore islands. Venezuela is among the most urbanized countries in Latin America;[22][23] the vast majority of Venezuelans live in the cities of the north and in the capital. The territory of Venezuela was colonized by Spain in 1522 amid resistance from Indigenous peoples. In 1811, it became one of the first Spanish-American territories to declare independence from the Spanish and to form part of the first federal Republic of Colombia (Gran Colombia). It separated as a full sovereign country in 1830. During the 19th century, Venezuela suffered political turmoil and autocracy, remaining dominated by regional military dictators until the mid-20th century. From 1958, the country had a series of democratic governments, as an exception where most of the region was ruled by military dictatorships, and the period was characterized by economic prosperity. Economic shocks in the 1980s and 1990s led to major political crises and widespread social unrest, including the deadly Caracazo riots of 1989, two attempted coups in 1992, and the impeachment of a President for embezzlement of public funds charges in 1993. The collapse in confidence in the existing parties saw the 1998 Venezuelan presidential election, the catalyst for the Bolivarian Revolution, which began with a 1999 Constituent Assembly, where a new Constitution of Venezuela was imposed. The government's populist social welfare policies were bolstered by soaring oil prices,[24] temporarily increasing social spending,[25] and reducing economic inequality and poverty in the early years of the regime.[26] However, poverty began to rapidly increase in the 2010s.[27][28] The 2013 Venezuelan presidential election was widely disputed leading to widespread protest, which triggered another nationwide crisis that continues to this day.[29] Venezuela has experienced democratic backsliding, shifting into an authoritarian state.[3] It ranks low in international measurements of freedom of the press and civil liberties and has high levels of perceived corruption.[30] Venezuela is a developing country and has the world's largest known oil reserves and has been one of the world's leading exporters of oil. Previously, the country was an underdeveloped exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and cocoa, but oil quickly came to dominate exports and government revenues. The excesses and poor policies of the incumbent government led to the collapse of Venezuela's entire economy.[31][32] The country struggles with record hyperinflation,[33][34] shortages of basic goods,[35] unemployment,[36] poverty,[37] disease, high child mortality, malnutrition, environmental issues, severe crime and corruption. These factors have precipitated the Venezuelan refugee crisis in which more than 7.7 million people had fled the country by June 2024.[38][39] By 2017, Venezuela was declared to be in default regarding debt payments by credit rating agencies.[40][41] The crisis in Venezuela has contributed to a rapidly deteriorating human rights situation. The 2024 presidential election were not recognized by the Carter Center and Organization of American States due to the lack of granular results, and disputed by the opposition, leading to protests across the country.[42] According to the most popular and accepted version, in 1499, an expedition led by Alonso de Ojeda visited the Venezuelan coast. The stilt houses in the area of Lake Maracaibo reminded the Italian navigator, Amerigo Vespucci, of the city of Venice, Italy, so he named the region Veneziola, or \"Little Venice\".[43] The Spanish version of Veneziola is Venezuela.[44] Martín Fernández de Enciso, a member of the Vespucci and Ojeda crew, gave a different account. In his work Summa de geografía, he states that the crew found Indigenous peoples who called themselves the Veneciuela. Thus, the name \"Venezuela\" may have evolved from the native word.[45] Previously, the official name was Estado de Venezuela (1830–1856), República de Venezuela (1856–1864), Estados Unidos de Venezuela (1864–1953), and again República de Venezuela (1953–1999). Evidence exists of human habitation in the area now known as Venezuela from about 15,000 years ago. Tools have been found on the high riverine terraces of the Rio Pedregal in western Venezuela.[46] Late Pleistocene hunting artifacts, including spear tips, have been found at a similar series of sites in northwestern Venezuela; according to radiocarbon dating, these date from 13,000 to 7,000 BC.[47] It is unknown how many people lived in Venezuela before the Spanish conquest; it has been estimated at one million.[48] In addition to Indigenous peoples known today, the population included groups such as the Kalina (Caribs), Auaké, Caquetio, Mariche, and Timoto–Cuicas. The Timoto–Cuica culture was the most complex society in Pre-Columbian Venezuela, with pre-planned permanent villages, surrounded by irrigated, terraced fields.[49] Their houses were made of stone and wood with thatched roofs. They were peaceful and depended on growing crops. Regional crops included potatoes and ullucos.[50] They left behind art, particularly anthropomorphic ceramics, but no major monuments. They spun vegetable fibers to weave into textiles and mats for housing. They are credited with having invented the arepa, a staple in Venezuelan cuisine.[51] After the conquest, the population dropped markedly, mainly through the spread of infectious diseases from Europe.[48] Two main north–south axes of pre-Columbian population were present, who cultivated maize in the west and manioc in the east.[48] Large parts of the llanos were cultivated through a combination of slash and burn and permanent settled agriculture.[48] In 1498, during his third voyage to the Americas, Christopher Columbus sailed near the Orinoco Delta and landed in the Gulf of Paria.[52] Amazed by the great offshore current of freshwater which deflected his course eastward, Columbus expressed in a letter to Isabella and Ferdinand that he must have reached Heaven on Earth (terrestrial paradise): Great signs are these of the Terrestrial Paradise... for I have never read or heard of such a large quantity of fresh water being inside and in such close proximity to salt water; the very mild temperateness also corroborates this; and if the water of which I speak does not proceed from Paradise then it is an even greater marvel, because I do not believe such a large and deep river has ever been known to exist in this world.[53] Spain's colonization of mainland Venezuela started in 1522, establishing its first permanent South American settlement in the present-day[update] city of Cumaná. In the 16th century, the king of Spain granted a concession to the German Welser family. Klein-Venedig [54] became the most extensive initiative in the German colonization of the Americas from 1528 to 1546. The Welsers were bankers to the Habsburgs and financiers of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, who was King of Spain and had borrowed heavily from them to pay bribes for his Imperial election.[55] In 1528, Charles V granted the Welsers the right to explore, rule and colonize the territory, as well as to seek the mythical golden town of El Dorado.[56][57][58] The first expedition was led by Ambrosius Ehinger, who established Maracaibo in 1529. After the deaths of first Ehinger (1533), then Nikolaus Federmann, and Georg von Speyer (1540), Philipp von Hutten persisted in exploring the interior. In absence of von Hutten from the capital of the province, the crown of Spain claimed the right to appoint a governor. On Hutten's return to the capital, Santa Ana de Coro, in 1546, the Spanish governor Juan de Carvajal had Hutten and Bartholomeus VI. Welser executed. Subsequently, Charles V revoked Welser's concession. The Welsers transported German miners to the colony, in addition to 4,000 African slaves to plant sugar cane plantations. Many German colonists died from tropical diseases, to which they had no immunity, or through wars with the Indigenous inhabitants. Native caciques (leaders) such as Guaicaipuro (c. 1530–1568) and Tamanaco (died 1573) attempted to resist Spanish incursions, but the newcomers ultimately subdued them.[59] In the 16th century, during the Spanish colonization, indigenous peoples such as the Mariches, themselves descendants of the Kalina, were converted to Roman Catholicism. Some resisting tribes or leaders are commemorated in place names, including Caracas, Chacao and Los Teques. The early colonial settlements focused on the northern coast,[48] but in the mid-18th century, the Spanish pushed farther inland along the Orinoco River. Here, the Ye'kuana organized resistance in 1775–76.[60] Spain's eastern Venezuelan settlements were incorporated into New Andalusia Province. Administered by the Royal Audiencia of Santo Domingo from the early 16th century, most of Venezuela became part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada in the early 18th century, and was then reorganized as an autonomous Captaincy General starting in 1777. Caracas, founded in the central coastal region in 1567, was well-placed to become a key location, being near the coastal port of La Guaira and in a valley, in a mountain range, providing defensive strength against pirates and a more fertile and healthy climate.[61] After unsuccessful uprisings, Venezuela, under the leadership of Francisco de Miranda, a Venezuelan marshal who had fought in the American and French Revolutions, declared independence as the First Republic of Venezuela on 5 July 1811.[62] This began the Venezuelan War of Independence. A devastating 1812 Caracas earthquake, together with the rebellion of the Venezuelan llaneros, helped bring down the republic.[63] Simón Bolívar, new leader of the independentist forces, launched his Admirable Campaign in 1813 from New Granada, retaking most of the territory and being proclaimed as El Libertador (\"The Liberator\"). A Second Republic of Venezuela was proclaimed on 7 August 1813, but lasted only a few months before being crushed by royalist caudillo José Tomás Boves and his personal army of llaneros.[64] The end of the French invasion of homeland Spain in 1814 allowed a large expeditionary force to come under general Pablo Morillo, with the goal to regain the lost territory in Venezuela and New Granada. As the war reached a stalemate on 1817, Bolívar reestablished the Third Republic of Venezuela on the territory still controlled by the patriots, mainly in the Guayana and Llanos regions. This republic was short-lived as only two years later, during the Congress of Angostura of 1819, the union of Venezuela with New Granada was decreed to form the Republic of Colombia. The war continued until full victory and sovereignty was attained after the Battle of Carabobo on 24 June 1821.[65] On 24 July 1823, José Prudencio Padilla and Rafael Urdaneta helped seal Venezuelan independence with their victory in the Battle of Lake Maracaibo.[18] New Granada's congress gave Bolívar control of the Granadian army; leading it, he liberated several countries and founded the Republic of Colombia (Gran Colombia).[65] Sucre went on to liberate Ecuador and become the second president of Bolivia. Venezuela remained part of Gran Colombia until 1830, when a rebellion led by José Antonio Páez allowed the proclamation of a newly independent Venezuela, on 22 September;[66] Páez became the first president of the new State of Venezuela.[67] Between one-quarter and one-third of Venezuela's population was lost during these two decades of war (including about half the Venezuelans of European descent),[68] which by 1830, was estimated at 800,000.[69] In the Flag of Venezuela, the yellow stands for land wealth, the blue for the sea that separates Venezuela from Spain, and the red for the blood shed by the heroes of independence.[70] Slavery in Venezuela was abolished in 1854.[69] Much of Venezuela's 19th-century history was characterized by political turmoil and dictatorial rule, including the Independence leader José Antonio Páez, who gained the presidency three times and served 11 years between 1830 and 1863. This culminated in the Federal War (1859–63). In the latter half of the century, Antonio Guzmán Blanco, another caudillo, served 13 years, between 1870 and 1887, with three other presidents interspersed. In 1895, a longstanding dispute with Great Britain about the Essequibo territory, which Britain claimed as part of British Guiana and Venezuela saw as Venezuelan territory, erupted into the Venezuela Crisis of 1895. The dispute became a diplomatic crisis when Venezuela's lobbyist, William L. Scruggs, sought to argue that British behavior over the issue violated the United States' Monroe Doctrine of 1823, and used his influence in Washington, D.C., to pursue the matter. Then, U.S. president Grover Cleveland adopted a broad interpretation of the doctrine that declared an American interest in any matter within the hemisphere.[71] Britain ultimately accepted arbitration, but in negotiations over its terms was able to persuade the U.S. on many details. A tribunal convened in Paris in 1898 to decide the issue and in 1899 awarded the bulk of the disputed territory to British Guiana.[72] In 1899, Cipriano Castro, assisted by his friend Juan Vicente Gómez, seized power in Caracas. Castro defaulted on Venezuela's considerable foreign debts and declined to pay compensation to foreigners caught up in Venezuela's civil wars. This led to the Venezuela Crisis of 1902–1903, in which Britain, Germany and Italy imposed a naval blockade before international arbitration at the new Permanent Court of Arbitration was agreed. In 1908, another dispute broke out with the Netherlands, which was resolved when Castro left for medical treatment in Germany and was promptly overthrown by Juan Vicente Gómez (1908–35). The discovery of massive oil deposits in Lake Maracaibo during World War I[73] proved pivotal for Venezuela and transformed its economy from a heavy dependence on agricultural exports. It prompted a boom that lasted into the 1980s; by 1935, Venezuela's per capita gross domestic product was Latin America's highest.[74] Gómez benefited handsomely from this, as corruption thrived, but at the same time, the new source of income helped him centralize the state and develop its authority. Gómez remained the most powerful man in Venezuela until his death in 1935. The gomecista dictatorship (1935–1945) system largely continued under Eleazar López Contreras, but from 1941, under Isaías Medina Angarita, was relaxed. Angarita granted a range of reforms, including the legalization of all political parties. After World War II, immigration from Southern Europe and poorer Latin American countries markedly diversified Venezuelan society.[75] In 1945, a civilian-military coup overthrew Medina Angarita and ushered in a period of democratic rule (1945–1948) under the mass membership party Democratic Action, initially under Rómulo Betancourt, until Rómulo Gallegos won the 1947 Venezuelan presidential election (the first free and fair elections in Venezuela).[76][77] Gallegos governed until overthrown by a military junta led by the triumvirate Luis Felipe Llovera Páez [es], Marcos Pérez Jiménez, and Gallegos' Defense Minister, Carlos Delgado Chalbaud, in the 1948 Venezuelan coup d'état. The most powerful man in the military junta (1948–58) was Pérez Jiménez and he was suspected of being behind the death of Chalbaud, who died in a bungled kidnapping in 1950. When the junta unexpectedly lost the 1952 presidential election, it ignored the results and Jiménez was installed as president[citation needed] Jiménez was forced out on 23 January 1958.[18] In an effort to consolidate a young democracy, the three major political parties (Acción Democrática (AD), COPEI and Unión Republicana Democrática (URD), with the notable exception of the Communist Party of Venezuela), signed the Puntofijo Pact power-sharing agreement. AD and COPEI dominated the political landscape for four decades. During the presidencies of Rómulo Betancourt (1959–64, his second term) and Raúl Leoni (1964–69), substantial guerilla movements occurred. Most laid down their arms under Rafael Caldera's first presidency (1969–74). Caldera had won the 1968 election for COPEI, the first time a party other than Democratic Action took the presidency through a democratic election. The new democratic order had its antagonists. Betancourt suffered an attack planned by the Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo in 1960, and the leftists excluded from the Pact initiated an insurgency by organizing themselves into the Armed Forces of National Liberation, sponsored by the Communist Party and Fidel Castro. In 1962 they tried to destabilize the military corps, with failed revolts. Betancourt promoted a foreign policy, the Betancourt Doctrine, in which he only recognized elected governments by popular vote.[need quotation to verify] The 1973 Venezuelan presidential election of Carlos Andrés Pérez coincided with an oil crisis, in which Venezuela's income exploded as oil prices soared; oil industries were nationalized in 1976. This led to massive increases in public spending, but also increases in external debts, until the collapse of oil prices during the 1980s crippled the economy. As the government started to devalue the currency in 1983 to face its financial obligations, standards of living fell dramatically. Failed economic policies and increasing corruption in government led to rising poverty and crime, worsening social indicators, and increased political instability.[78] In the 1980s, the Presidential Commission for State Reform (COPRE) emerged as a mechanism of political innovation. Venezuela decentralized its political system and diversified its economy, reducing the size of the state. COPRE operated as an innovation mechanism, also by incorporating issues into the political agenda, that were excluded from public deliberation by the main actors of the democratic system. The most discussed topics were incorporated into the public agenda: decentralization, political participation, municipalization, judicial order reforms and the role of the state in a new economic strategy. The social reality made the changes difficult to apply.[79] Economic crises in the 1980s and 1990s led to a political crisis. Hundreds of people were killed by security forces and the military in the Caracazo riots of 1989, during the second presidential term of Carlos Andrés Pérez (1989–1993) and after the implementation of economic austerity measures.[80] Hugo Chávez, who in 1982 had promised to depose the bipartisanship governments, used the growing anger at economic austerity measures to justify a coup attempt in February 1992;[81][82] a second coup d'état attempt occurred in November.[82] President Carlos Andrés Pérez (re-elected in 1988) was impeached under embezzlement charges in 1993, leading to the interim presidency of Ramón José Velásquez (1993–1994). Coup leader Chávez was pardoned in March 1994 by president Rafael Caldera (1994–1999, his second term), with a clean slate and his political rights reinstated, allowing Chávez to win and maintain the presidency continuously from 1999 until his death in 2013. Chávez won the elections of 1998, 2000, 2006 and 2012 and the presidential referendum of 2004. A collapse in confidence in the existing parties led to Hugo Chávez being elected president in 1998 and the subsequent launch of a \"Bolivarian Revolution\", beginning with a 1999 constituent assembly to write a new Constitution. The Revolution refers to a left-wing populism social movement and political process led by Chávez, who founded the Fifth Republic Movement in 1997 and the United Socialist Party of Venezuela in 2007. The \"Bolivarian Revolution\" is named after Simón Bolívar. According to Chávez and other supporters, the \"Bolivarian Revolution\" sought to build a mass movement to implement Bolivarianism—popular democracy, economic independence, equitable distribution of revenues, and an end to political corruption. They interpret Bolívar's ideas from a populist perspective, using socialist rhetoric. This led to formation of the Fifth Republic of Venezuela, commonly known as the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, that continues to the present day. Venezuela has been considered the Bolivarian Republic following the adoption of the new Constitution of 1999. Following Chávez's election, Venezuela developed into a dominant-party system, dominated by the United Socialist Party of Venezuela. In April 2002, Chávez was briefly ousted from power in the 2002 Venezuelan coup d'état attempt following popular demonstrations by his opponents,[83] but Chavez returned after two days as a result of demonstrations by poor Chávez supporters and actions by the military.[84][85] Chávez remained in power after an all-out national strike that lasted from December 2002 to February 2003, including a strike/lockout in the state oil company PDVSA.[86] Capital flight before and during the strike led to the reimposition of currency controls. In the subsequent decade, the government was forced into currency devaluations.[87][88][89][90] These devaluations did not improve the situation[vague] of the people who rely on imported products or locally produced products that depend on imported inputs, while dollar-denominated oil sales account for the majority of exports.[91] The profits of the oil industry have been lost to \"social engineering\" and corruption, instead of investments needed to maintain oil production.[92] Chávez survived further political tests, including an August 2004 recall referendum. He was elected for another term in December 2006 and for a third term in October 2012. However, he was never sworn in due to medical complications; he died in March 2013.[93] The presidential election that took place in April 2013, was the first since Chávez took office in 1999 in which his name did not appear on the ballot.[94][self-published source?] Under the Bolivarian government, Venezuela went from being one of the richest countries in Latin America to one of the poorest.[95] Hugo Chávez's socioeconomic policies of relying on oil sales and importing goods resulted in large amounts of debt, no change to corruption in Venezuela and culminated into a crisis in Venezuela.[95] As a result, the Venezuelan refugee crisis, the largest emigration of people in Latin America's history,[96] occurred, with over 7 million – about 20% of the country's population – emigrating.[97][98] Chávez initiated Bolivarian missions, programs aimed at helping the poor.[99] Poverty began to increase into the 2010s.[27] Nicolás Maduro was picked by Chavez as his successor, appointing him vice president in 2013.[89][100][101] Maduro has been president of Venezuela since 14 April 2013, when he won the presidential election after Chavez' death, with 51% of the vote, against Henrique Capriles on 49%. The Democratic Unity Roundtable contested Maduro's election as fraud, but an audit of 56% of the vote showed no discrepancies,[102] and the Supreme Court of Venezuela ruled Maduro was the legitimate president.[103] Opposition leaders and some international media consider Maduro's government a dictatorship.[13][14][15] Since February 2014, hundreds of thousands have protested over high levels of criminal violence, corruption, hyperinflation, and chronic scarcity of basic goods due to government policies.[104][105][106] Demonstrations and riots have resulted in over 40 fatalities in the unrest between Chavistas and opposition protesters[107] and opposition leaders, including Leopoldo López and Antonio Ledezma were arrested.[107][108][109] Human rights groups condemned the arrest of López.[110] In the 2015 Venezuelan parliamentary election, the opposition gained a majority.[111] Venezuela devalued its currency in February 2013 due to rising shortages,[90][112] which included milk and other necessities. This led to an increase in malnutrition, especially among children.[113][114] The economy had become dependent on the exportation of oil, with crude accounting for 86% of exports,[115] and a high price per barrel to support social programs. Beginning in 2014 the price of oil plummeted from over $100 to $40. This placed pressure on the economy, which was no longer able to afford vast social programs. The Government began taking more money from PDVSA, the state oil company, resulting in a lack of reinvestment in fields and employees. Production decreased from its height of nearly 3 to 1 million barrels (480 to 160 thousand cubic metres) per day.[116][117][118] In 2014, Venezuela entered a recession,[119] and in 2015, had the world's highest inflation, surpassing 100%.[120] In 2017, Donald Trump's administration imposed more economic sanctions against PDVSA and Venezuelan officials.[121][122][123] Economic problems, as well as crime, were the causes of the 2014–present Venezuelan protests.[124][125] Since 2014, roughly 5.6 million people have fled Venezuela.[126] In January 2016, Maduro decreed an \"economic emergency\", revealing the extent of the crisis and expanding his powers.[127] In July 2016, Colombian border crossings were temporarily opened to allow Venezuelans to purchase food and basic health items.[128] In September 2016, a study[129] indicated 15% of Venezuelans were eating \"food waste discarded by commercial establishments\". 200 prison riots had occurred by October 2016.[130] The Maduro-aligned Supreme Tribunal, which had been overturning National Assembly decisions since the opposition took control, took over the functions of the assembly, creating the 2017 Venezuelan constitutional crisis.[13] In August 2017, the 2017 Constituent National Assembly was elected and stripped the National Assembly of its powers.[citation needed] The election raised concerns of an emerging dictatorship.[131] In December 2017, Maduro declared opposition parties barred from the following year's presidential vote after they boycotted mayoral polls.[132] Maduro won the 2018 election with 68% of the vote. The result was challenged by Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, France and the US who deemed it fraudulent and recognized Juan Guaidó as president.[133][134][135] Other countries continued to recognize Maduro,[136][137] although China, facing financial pressure over its position, began hedging by decreasing loans, cancelling joint ventures, and signaling willingness to work with all parties.[138][139] In August 2019, Trump imposed an economic embargo against Venezuela.[140] In March 2020, Trump indicted Maduro and Venezuelan officials, on charges of drug trafficking, narcoterrorism, and corruption.[141] In June 2020, a report documented enforced disappearances that occurred in 2018–19. 724 enforced disappearances of political detainees were reported. The report stated that security forces subjected victims to torture. The report stated the government used enforced disappearances to silence opponents and other critical voices.[142][143] Maduro ran for a third consecutive term in the 2024 presidential election, while former diplomat Edmundo González Urrutia represented the Unitary Platform (Spanish: Plataforma Unitaria Democrática; PUD), the main opposition political alliance.[144][145] Polls conducted before the election indicated that González would win by a wide margin. After the government-controlled National Electoral Council (CNE) announced partial results showing a narrow Maduro victory on 29 July, world leaders predominantly expressed skepticism of the claimed results and did not recognize the CNE claims[146][147] with only some exceptions.[148] Both González and Maduro proclaimed themselves winners of the election. The results of the election were not recognized by the Carter Center and Organization of American States due to the lack of granular results, and disputed by the opposition, which claimed a landslide victory and released access to vote tallies collected by poll watchers from a majority of polling centers as proof.[149][150][151][152] In the aftermath of the announcement of results by the election authorities, protests broke out across the country. Venezuela is located in the north of South America; geologically, its mainland rests on the South American Plate. It has a total area of 916,445 km2 (353,841 sq mi) and a land area of 882,050 km2 (340,560 sq mi), making Venezuela the 33rd largest country in the world. The territory it controls lies between latitudes 0° and 16°N and longitudes 59° and 74°W. Shaped roughly like a triangle, the country has a 2,800 km (1,700 mi) coastline in the north, which includes numerous islands in the Caribbean and the northeast borders the northern Atlantic Ocean. Most observers describe Venezuela in terms of four fairly well defined topographical regions: the Maracaibo lowlands in the northwest, the northern mountains extending in a broad east–west arc from the Colombian border along the northern Caribbean coast, the wide plains in central Venezuela, and the Guiana Highlands in the southeast. The northern mountains are the extreme northeastern extensions of South America's Andes mountain range. Pico Bolívar, the nation's highest point at 4,979 m (16,335 ft), lies in this region. To the south, the dissected Guiana Highlands contain the northern fringes of the Amazon Basin and Angel Falls, the world's highest waterfall, as well as tepuis, large table-like mountains. The country's center is characterized by the llanos, which are extensive plains that stretch from the Colombian border in the far west to the Orinoco River delta in the east. The Orinoco, with its rich alluvial soils, binds the largest and most important river system of the country; it originates in one of the largest watersheds in Latin America. The Caroní and the Apure are other major rivers. Venezuela borders Colombia to the west, Guyana to the east, and Brazil to the south. Caribbean islands such as Trinidad and Tobago, Grenada, Curaçao, Aruba, and the Leeward Antilles lie near the Venezuelan coast. Venezuela has territorial disputes with Guyana, formerly United Kingdom, largely concerning the Essequibo area and with Colombia concerning the Gulf of Venezuela. In 1895, after years of diplomatic attempts to solve the border dispute, the dispute over the Essequibo River border flared up. It was submitted to a \"neutral\" commission (composed of British, American, and Russian representatives and without a direct Venezuelan representative), which in 1899 decided mostly against Venezuela's claim.[citation needed] Venezuela is entirely located in the tropics over the Equator to around 12° N. Its climate varies from humid low-elevation plains, where average annual temperatures range as high as 35 °C (95.0 °F), to glaciers and highlands (the páramos) with an average yearly temperature of 8 °C (46.4 °F). Annual rainfall varies from 430 mm (16.9 in) in the semiarid portions of the northwest to over 1,000 mm (39.4 in) in the Orinoco Delta of the far east and the Amazonian Jungle in the south. The precipitation level is lower in the period from August through April. These periods are referred to as hot-humid and cold-dry seasons. Another characteristic of the climate is this variation throughout the country by the existence of a mountain range called \"Cordillera de la Costa\" which crosses the country from east to west. The majority of the population lives in these mountains.[153] The country falls into four horizontal temperature zones based primarily on elevation, having tropical, dry, temperate with dry winters, and polar (alpine tundra) climates, amongst others.[154][155][156] In the tropical zone—below 800 m (2,625 ft)—temperatures are hot, with yearly averages ranging between 26 and 28 °C (78.8 and 82.4 °F). The temperate zone ranges between 800 and 2,000 m (2,625 and 6,562 ft) with averages from 12 to 25 °C (53.6 to 77.0 °F); many of Venezuela's cities, including the capital, lie in this region. Colder conditions with temperatures from 9 to 11 °C (48.2 to 51.8 °F) are found in the cool zone between 2,000 and 3,000 m (6,562 and 9,843 ft), especially in the Venezuelan Andes, where pastureland and permanent snowfield with yearly averages below 8 °C (46 °F) cover land above 3,000 meters (9,843 ft) in the páramos. The highest temperature recorded was 42 °C (108 °F) in Machiques,[157] and the lowest temperature recorded was −11 °C (12 °F), reported from an uninhabited high altitude at Páramo de Piedras Blancas (Mérida state).[158] Venezuela lies within the Neotropical realm; large portions of the country were originally covered by moist broadleaf forests. One of 17 megadiverse countries,[159] Venezuela's habitats range from the Andes Mountains in the west to the Amazon Basin rainforest in the south, via extensive llanos plains and Caribbean coast in the center and the Orinoco River Delta in the east. They include xeric scrublands in the extreme northwest and coastal mangrove forests in the northeast.[153] Its cloud forests and lowland rainforests are particularly rich.[160] Animals of Venezuela are diverse and include manatees, three-toed sloth, two-toed sloth, Amazon river dolphins, and Orinoco Crocodiles, which have been reported to reach up to 6.6 m (22 ft) in length. Venezuela hosts a total of 1,417 bird species, 48 of which are endemic.[161] Important birds include ibises, ospreys, kingfishers,[160] and the yellow-orange Venezuelan troupial, the national bird. Notable mammals include the giant anteater, jaguar, and the capybara, the world's largest rodent. More than half of Venezuelan avian and mammalian species are found in the Amazonian forests south of the Orinoco.[162] For the fungi, an account was provided by R.W.G. Dennis[163] which has been digitized and the records made available on-line as part of the Cybertruffle Robigalia database.[164] That database includes nearly 3,900 species of fungi recorded from Venezuela, but is far from complete, and the true total number of fungal species already known from Venezuela is likely higher, given the generally accepted estimate that only about 7% of all fungi worldwide have so far been discovered.[165] Among plants of Venezuela, over 25,000 species of orchids are found in the country's cloud forest and lowland rainforest ecosystems.[160] These include the flor de mayo orchid (Cattleya mossiae), the national flower. Venezuela's national tree is the araguaney. The tops of the tepuis are also home to several carnivorous plants including the marsh pitcher plant, Heliamphora, and the insectivorous bromeliad, Brocchinia reducta. Venezuela is among the top 20 countries in terms of endemism.[166] Among its animals, 23% of reptilian and 50% of amphibian species, including the Trinidad poison frog, are endemic.[166][167] Although the available information is still very small, a first effort has been made to estimate the number of fungal species endemic to Venezuela: 1334 species of fungi have been tentatively identified as possibly endemic.[168] Some 38% of the over 21,000 plant species known from Venezuela are unique to the country.[166] Venezuela is one of the 10 most biodiverse countries on the planet, yet it is one of the leaders of deforestation due to economic and political factors. Each year, roughly 287,600 hectares of forest are permanently destroyed, and other areas are degraded by mining, oil extraction, and logging. Between 1990 and 2005, Venezuela officially lost 8.3% of its forest cover, which is about 4.3 million ha. In response, federal protections for critical habitat were implemented; for example, 20% to 33% of forested land is protected.[162] The country's biosphere reserve is part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves; five wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention.[169] In 2003, 70% of the nation's land was under conservation management in over 200 protected areas, including 43 national parks.[170] Venezuela's 43 national parks include Canaima National Park, Morrocoy National Park, and Mochima National Park. In the far south is a reserve for the country's Yanomami tribes. Covering 32,000 square miles (82,880 square kilometres), the area is off-limits to farmers, miners, and all non-Yanomami settlers. Venezuela was one of the few countries that did not enter an INDC at COP21.[172][173] Many terrestrial ecosystems are considered endangered, specially the dry forest in the northern regions of the country and the coral reefs in the Caribbean coast.[174][175][176] There are 105 protected areas in Venezuela, which cover around 26% of the country's continental, marine and insular surface.[citation needed] The country is made up of three river basins: the Caribbean Sea, the Atlantic Ocean and Lake Valencia, which forms an endorheic basin.[177] On the Atlantic side it drains most of Venezuela's river waters. The largest basin in this area is the extensive Orinoco basin[178] whose surface area, close to one million km2, is greater than that of the whole of Venezuela, although it has a presence of 65% in the country. The size of this basin - similar to that of the Danube - makes it the third largest in South America, and it gives rise to a flow of some 33,000 m3/s, making the Orinoco the third largest in the world, and also one of the most valuable from the point of view of renewable natural resources. The Rio or Brazo Casiquiare is unique in the world, as it is a natural derivation of the Orinoco that, after some 500 km in length, connects it to the Negro River, which in turn is a tributary of the Amazon. The Orinoco receives directly or indirectly rivers such as the Ventuari, the Caura, the Caroní, the Meta, the Arauca, the Apure and many others. Other Venezuelan rivers that empty into the Atlantic are the waters of the San Juan and Cuyuní basins. Finally, there is the Amazon River, which receives the Guainía, the Negro and others. Other basins are the Gulf of Paria and the Esequibo River. The second most important watershed is the Caribbean Sea. The rivers of this region are usually short and of scarce and irregular flow, with some exceptions such as the Catatumbo, which originates in Colombia and drains into the Maracaibo Lake basin. Among the rivers that reach the Maracaibo lake basin are the Chama, the Escalante, the Catatumbo, and the contributions of the smaller basins of the Tocuyo, Yaracuy, Neverí and Manzanares rivers. A minimum drains to the Lake Valencia basin.[179] Of the total extension of the rivers, a total of 5400 km are navigable. Other rivers worth mentioning are the Apure, Arauca, Caura, Meta, Barima, Portuguesa, Ventuari and Zulia, among others. The country's main lakes are Lake Maracaibo[180] -the largest in South America- open to the sea through the natural channel, but with fresh water, and Lake Valencia with its endorheic system. Other noteworthy bodies of water are the Guri reservoir, the Altagracia lagoon, the Camatagua reservoir and the Mucubají lagoon in the Andes. The Venezuelan natural landscape[181] is the product of the interaction of tectonic plates[181] that since the Paleozoic have contributed to its current appearance. On the formed structures, seven physical-natural units have been modeled, differentiated in their relief and in their natural resources. The relief of Venezuela has the following characteristics: coastline with several peninsulas[182] and islands, adenas of the Andes mountain range (north and northwest), Lake Maracaibo (between the chains, on the coast);[183] Orinoco river delta,[184] region of peneplains and plateaus (tepui, east of the Orinoco) that together form the Guyanas massif (plateaus, southeast of the country). The oldest rock formations in South America are found in the complex basement of the Guyanas highlands[185] and in the crystalline line of the Maritime and Cordillera massifs in Venezuela. The Venezuelan part of the Guyanas Altiplano consists of a large granite block of gneiss and other crystalline Archean rocks, with underlying layers of sandstone and shale clay.[186] The core of granite and cordillera is, to a large extent, flanked by sedimentary layers from the Cretaceous,[187] folded in an anticline structure. Between these orographic systems there are plains covered with tertiary and quaternary layers of gravel, sands and clayey marls. The depression contains lagoons and lakes, among which is that of Maracaibo, and presents, on the surface, alluvial deposits from the Quaternary.[188] Also known as the Cordillera de la Costa, stretches along Venezuela's northern coast. This region is known for its lush tropical rainforests, stunning coastal views, and a rich variety of flora and fauna. The intermountain depressions, or valleys, between the mountain ranges are often home to fertile agricultural land and vibrant communities. These valleys offer a stark contrast to the rugged mountains that rise dramatically from the coast. Situated in northwestern Venezuela, the Lara-Falcón Highlands exhibit a terrain defined by plateaus and rolling hills. These highlands provide a significant contrast to the surrounding lowlands and coastal areas. The relief is characterized by gently sloping plateaus that support agriculture, including coffee and cacao cultivation. This region's semi-arid climate and picturesque landscapes make it an important agricultural and tourism center. Encompass the basin of Lake Maracaibo and the plains surrounding the Gulf of Venezuela. This region offers two distinct plains—the northern one is relatively dry, while the southern one is humid and dotted with swamps. The relief here is primarily characterized by flat terrain, with the exception of some elevated areas near the lake. Lake Maracaibo itself sits in a depression, surrounded by oil-rich lands and productive agricultural areas.[183] The Venezuelan Andes, part of the broader Andes mountain range, offer a striking relief with towering peaks, deep valleys, and fertile intermontane basins. Dominated by these corpulent mountain ranges, including Venezuela's highest peak, Bolívar Peak, the region's rugged and picturesque landscapes are defined by its high-altitude terrain. The unique relief of this area finds its origins in the Last Glacial Period, where the interplay of repeated glacier advances and retreats sculpted the landscape, shaped by the cold, high-altitude climate. This glacial heritage has left a lasting imprint, with glaciers carving deep valleys and polishing rugged peaks, while sheltered intramontane valleys offer fertile soils and temperate microclimates, creating ideal conditions for agriculture and human settlement. Los Llanos, or \"the plains\", are expansive sedimentary basins characterized by predominantly flat relief.[189] However, the eastern Llanos feature low-plateaus and the Unare depression, created through mesa erosion, adding diversity to the terrain. This region is subject to seasonal flooding, transforming the flat plains into a vast wetland during the rainy season. The relief here influences the region's unique ecosystems, including extensive grasslands and abundant wildlife. The Guiana Shield boasts a varied relief shaped by geological processes over millions of years. This region encompasses peneplains, rugged mountain ranges, foothills, and the iconic tepuis, or table-top mountains. The tepuis stand as isolated, flat-topped plateaus that rise dramatically from the surrounding terrain. This unique relief contributes to the region's remarkable biodiversity and scientific significance.[185] The Orinoco Delta's relief is characterized by a complex system of lands and waters. It consists of numerous channels, islands, and shifting sedimentary deposits. While the relief may appear relatively uniform, it conceals a dynamic environment influenced by seasonal flooding and sediment deposition. This complex deltaic relief supports diverse aquatic life and the livelihoods of Indigenous communities adapted to its ever-changing landscapes.[184] The valleys are undoubtedly the most important type of landscape in the Venezuelan territory,[190] not because of their spatial extension, but because they are the environment where most of the country's population and economic activities are concentrated. On the other hand, there are valleys throughout almost all the national space, except in the great sedimentary basins of the Llanos and the depression of the Maracaibo Lake, except also in the Amazonian peneplains.[191] By their modeling, the valleys of the Venezuelan territory belong mainly to two types: valleys of fluvial type and valleys of glacial type.[192] Much more frequent, the former largely dominate the latter, which are restricted to the highest parts of the Andes. Moreover, most glacial valleys are relics of a past geologic epoch, which culminated some 10,000 to 12,000 years ago. The deep and narrow Andean valleys are very different from the wide depressions of Aragua and Carabobo, in the Cordillera de la Costa, or from the valleys nestled in the Mesas de Monagas. These examples indicate that the configuration of the local relief is decisive in identifying regional types of valleys. Likewise, due to their warm climate, the Guayana valleys are distinguished from the temperate or cold Andean valleys by their humid environment. Both are, in turn, different from the semi-arid depressions of the states of Lara and Falcón. The Andean valleys, essentially agricultural, precociously populated but nowadays in loss of speed, do not confront the same problems of space occupation as the strongly urbanized and industrialized valleys of the central section of the Cordillera de la Costa. On the other hand, the unpopulated and practically untouched Guiana valleys are another category this area is called the Lost World (Mundo Perdido).[191] The Andean valleys are undoubtedly the most impressive of the Venezuelan territory because of the energy of the encasing reliefs, whose summits often dominate the valley bottoms by 3,000 to 3,500 meters of relative altitude. They are also the most picturesque in terms of their style of habitat, forms of land use, handicraft production and all the traditions linked to these activities.[191] Venezuela has a great diversity of landscapes and climates,[193] including arid and dry areas. The main desert in the country is in the state of Falcon near the city of Coro. It is now a protected park, the Médanos de Coro National Park.[194] The park is the largest of its kind in Venezuela, covering 91 square kilometres. The landscape is dotted with cacti and other xerophytic plants that can survive in humidity-free conditions near the desert. Desert wildlife includes mostly lizards, iguanas and other reptiles. Although less frequent, the desert is home to some foxes, giant anteaters and rabbits. There are also some native bird populations, such as the sparrowhawk, tropical mockingbird, scaly dove and crested quail. Other desert areas in the country include part of the Guajira Desert in the Guajira Municipality in the north of Zulia State[195] and facing the Gulf of Venezuela, the Médanos de Capanaparo[196] in the Santos Luzardo National Park in Apure State, the Medanos de la Isla de Zapara[197] in Zulia State, the so-called Hundición de Yay[198] in the Andrés Eloy Blanco Municipality of Lara State, and the Urumaco Formation also in Falcón State. Two major blocs of political parties are in Venezuela: the incumbent leftist bloc United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), its major allies Fatherland for All (PPT) and the Communist Party of Venezuela (PCV), and the opposition bloc grouped into the electoral coalition Mesa de la Unidad Democrática. This includes A New Era (UNT) together with allied parties Project Venezuela, Justice First, Movement for Socialism (MAS) and others. The Venezuelan president is elected by a vote, with direct and universal suffrage, and is both head of state and head of government. The term of office is six years, and (as of 15 February 2009) a president may be re-elected an unlimited number of times. The president appoints the vice president and decides the size and composition of the cabinet and makes appointments to it with the involvement of the legislature. The president can ask the legislature to reconsider portions of laws he finds objectionable, but a simple parliamentary majority can override these objections. The president may ask the National Assembly to pass an enabling act granting the ability to rule by decree in specified policy areas; this requires a two-thirds majority in the Assembly. Since 1959, six Venezuelan presidents have been granted such powers. The unicameral Venezuelan parliament is the Asamblea Nacional (\"National Assembly\"). The number of members is variable – each state and the Capital district elect three representatives plus the result of dividing the state population by 1.1% of the total population of the country.[199] Three seats are reserved for representatives of Venezuela's Indigenous peoples. For the 2011–2016 period the number of seats is 165.[200] All deputies serve five-year terms. The voting age in Venezuela is 18. Voting is not compulsory.[201] The legal system of Venezuela belongs to the Continental Law tradition. The highest judicial body is the Supreme Tribunal of Justice or Tribunal Supremo de Justicia, whose magistrates are elected by parliament for a single twelve-year term. The National Electoral Council (Consejo Nacional Electoral, or CNE) is in charge of electoral processes; it is formed by five main directors elected by the National Assembly. Supreme Court president Luisa Estela Morales said in December 2009 that Venezuela had moved away from \"a rigid division of powers\" toward a system characterized by \"intense coordination\" between the branches of government. Morales clarified that each power must be independent.[202] Venezuela is divided into 23 states (estados), a capital district (distrito capital) corresponding to the city of Caracas, and the Federal Dependencies (Dependencias Federales, a special territory). Venezuela is further subdivided into 335 municipalities (municipios); these are subdivided into over one thousand parishes (parroquias). The states are grouped into nine administrative regions (regiones administrativas), which were established in 1969 by presidential decree.[citation needed] The country can be further divided into ten geographical areas, some corresponding to climatic and biogeographical regions. In the north are the Venezuelan Andes and the Coro region, a mountainous tract in the northwest, holds several sierras and valleys. East of it are lowlands abutting Lake Maracaibo and the Gulf of Venezuela.[citation needed] The Central Range runs parallel to the coast and includes the hills surrounding Caracas; the Eastern Range, separated from the Central Range by the Gulf of Cariaco, covers all of Sucre and northern Monagas. The Insular Region includes all of Venezuela's island possessions: Nueva Esparta and the various Federal Dependencies. The Orinoco Delta, which forms a triangle covering Delta Amacuro, projects northeast into the Atlantic Ocean.[citation needed] The country maintains a claim on the territory it calls \"Guayana Esequiba\", the territory administered by Guyana west of the Esequibo River. In 1966 the British and Venezuelan governments signed the Geneva Agreement to resolve the conflict peacefully. The Port of Spain Protocol of 1970 set a deadline to try to resolve the issue, without success to date.[citation needed] The 2015 parliamentary elections were held on 6 December 2015 to elect the 164 deputies and three Indigenous representatives of the National Assembly. In 2014, a series of protest and demonstrations began in Venezuela, attributed[by whom?] to inflation, violence and shortages in Venezuela. The protests were largely peaceful.[204][better source needed] The government has accused the protest of being motivated by fascists, opposition leaders, capitalism and foreign influence,[205] President Maduro acknowledged PSUV defeat but attributed the opposition's victory to an intensification of an economic war. Despite this, Maduro said, \"I will stop by hook or by crook the opposition coming to power, whatever the costs, in any way\".[206] In the following months, Maduro fulfilled his promise of preventing the elected National Assembly from legislating. The first steps taken by PSUV and government were the substitution of the entire Supreme Court a day after the parliamentary elections,[207] contrary to the Constitution of Venezuela, acclaimed as a fraud by the majority of the Venezuelan and international press.[208][209][210][211] The Financial Times described the function of the Supreme Court in Venezuela as \"rubber stamping executive whims and vetoing legislation\".[212] The PSUV government used this violation to suspend several elected opponents.[213] Maduro said that \"the Amnesty law (approved by the Parliament) will not be executed\" and asked the Supreme Court to declare it unconstitutional.[214] On 16 January 2016, Maduro approved an unconstitutional economic emergency decree,[215] relegating to his own figure the legislative and executive powers, while also holding judiciary power through the fraudulent designation of judges the day after the election on 6 December 2015.[207][208][209][211] From these events, Maduro effectively controls all three branches of government. On 14 May 2016, constitutional guarantees were in fact suspended when Maduro decreed the extension of the economic emergency decree for another 60 days and declared a State of Emergency,[216] which is a clear violation of the Constitution of Venezuela[217] in the Article 338th: \"The approval of the extension of States of emergency corresponds to the National Assembly.\" Thus, constitutional rights in Venezuela are considered suspended in fact by many publications[218][219][220] and public figures.[221][222][223] On 14 May 2016, the Organization of American States was considering the application of the Inter-American Democratic Charter[224] sanctions for non-compliance to its own constitution. In March 2017, the Venezuelan Supreme Court took over law making powers from the National Assembly[225] but reversed its decision the following day.[226] Throughout most of the 20th century, Venezuela maintained friendly relations with most Latin American and Western nations. Relations between Venezuela and the United States government worsened in 2002, after the 2002 Venezuelan coup d'état attempt during which the U.S. government recognized the short-lived interim presidency of Pedro Carmona. In 2015, Venezuela was declared a national security threat by U.S. president Barack Obama.[227][228][229] Correspondingly, ties to various Latin American and Middle Eastern countries not allied to the U.S. have strengthened.[citation needed] Venezuela seeks alternative hemispheric integration via such proposals as the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas trade proposal and the newly launched Latin American television network teleSUR. Venezuela is one of five nations in the world—along with Russia, Nicaragua, Nauru, and Syria—to have recognized the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Venezuela was a proponent of OAS's decision to adopt its Anti-Corruption Convention[230] and is actively working in the Mercosur trade bloc to push increased trade and energy integration. Globally, it seeks a \"multi-polar\" world based on strengthened ties among undeveloped countries.[citation needed] On 26 April 2017, Venezuela announced its intention to withdraw from the OAS.[231] Venezuelan Foreign Minister Delcy Rodríguez said that President Nicolás Maduro plans to publicly renounce Venezuela's membership on 27 April 2017. It will take two years for the country to formally leave. During this period, the country does not plan on participating in the OAS.[232] Venezuela is involved in a long-standing disagreement about the control of the Guayana Esequiba area. Venezuela may suffer a deterioration of its power in international affairs if the global transition to renewable energy is completed. It is ranked 151 out of 156 countries in the index of Geopolitical Gains and Losses after energy transition (GeGaLo).[233] Venezuela is a charter member of the United Nations (UN), Organization of American States (OAS), Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA), Mercosur, Latin American Integration Association (LAIA) and Organization of Ibero-American States (OEI). The Bolivarian National Armed Forces (Fuerza Armada Nacional Bolivariana, FANB) are the unified military forces of Venezuela. It includes over 320,150 men and women, under Article 328 of the Constitution, in five components of ground, sea and air. The components of the FANB are: the Venezuelan Army, the Venezuelan Navy, the Venezuelan Air Force, the Venezuelan National Guard, and the Venezuelan National Militia. As of 2008[update], a further 600,000 soldiers were incorporated into a new branch, known as the Armed Reserve. The president of Venezuela is the commander-in-chief of the FANB. Its main purposes are to defend the sovereign national territory of Venezuela, airspace, and islands, fight against drug trafficking, search and rescue and, in the case of a natural disaster, civil protection. All male citizens of Venezuela have a constitutional duty to register for the military service at 18, which is the age of majority. In Venezuela, a person is murdered every 21 minutes.[242] Violent crimes have been so prevalent in Venezuela that the government no longer produces the crime data.[243] In 2013, the homicide rate was approximately 79 per 100,000, one of the world's highest, having quadrupled in the past 15 years with over 200,000 people murdered.[244] By 2015, it had risen to 90 per 100,000.[245] The capital Caracas has one of the greatest homicide rates of any large city in the world, with 122 homicides per 100,000 residents.[246] In 2008, polls indicated that crime was the number one concern of voters.[247] Attempts at fighting crime such as Operation Liberation of the People were implemented to crack down on gang-controlled areas[248] but, of reported criminal acts, less than 2% are prosecuted.[249] In 2017, the Financial Times noted that some of the arms procured by the government over the previous two decades had been diverted to paramilitary civilian groups and criminal syndicates.[212] Venezuela is especially dangerous for foreign travelers and investors who are visiting. The United States Department of State and the Government of Canada have warned foreign visitors that they may be subjected to robbery, kidnapping[250] and murder, and that their own diplomatic travelers are required to travel in armored vehicles.[251][252] The United Kingdom's Foreign and Commonwealth Office has advised against all travel to Venezuela.[253] Visitors have been murdered during robberies.[254][255] There are approximately 33 prisons holding about 50,000 inmates.[256] Venezuela's prison system is heavily overcrowded; its facilities have capacity for only 14,000 prisoners.[257] Human rights organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have increasingly criticized Venezuela's human rights record, with the former organization noting in 2017 that the Chavez and subsequently the Maduro government have increasingly concentrated power in the executive branch, eroded constitutional human rights protections and allowed the government to persecute and repress its critics and opposition.[258] Other persistent concerns as noted by the report included poor prison conditions, the continuous harassment of independent media and human rights defenders by the government. In 2006, the Economist Intelligence Unit rated Venezuela a \"hybrid regime\" and the third least democratic regime in Latin America on the Democracy Index.[259] The Democracy index downgraded Venezuela to an authoritarian regime in 2017, citing continued increasingly dictatorial behaviors by the Maduro government.[260] Corruption in Venezuela is high by world standards and was so for much of the 20th century. The discovery of oil worsened political corruption.[261] By the late 1970s, Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonso's description of oil as \"the Devil's excrement\" had become a common expression in Venezuela.[262] The Corruption Perceptions Index has ranked Venezuela as one of the most corrupt countries since the survey started in 1995. The 2010 ranking placed Venezuela at number 164, out of 178 ranked countries in government transparency.[263] By 2016, the rank had increased to 166 out of 178.[264] The World Justice Project ranked Venezuela 99th out of 99 countries surveyed in its 2014 Rule of Law Index.[265] This corruption is shown with Venezuela's significant involvement in drug trafficking, with Colombian cocaine and other drugs transiting Venezuela towards the United States and Europe. In the period 2003–2008 Venezuelan authorities seized the fifth-largest total quantity of cocaine in the world, behind Colombia, the United States, Spain and Panama.[266] In 2006, the government's agency for combating illegal drug trade in Venezuela, ONA, was incorporated into the office of the vice-president. However, many major government and military officials have been known for their involvement with drug trafficking.[267] Almost 82 per cent of Venezuelans live in poverty, with 53 per cent in extreme poverty, unable to buy even basic foodstuffs. – A UN special rapporteur said in February 2024 after visiting the country.[268] Venezuela was \"once among South America's wealthiest countries\" before the economic meltdown under Maduro regime.[269] \"The formerly rich petro-state has seen GDP fall by 80 percent in less than a decade, driving some seven million of its citizens to flee. Most Venezuelans live on just a few dollars a month, with the health care and education systems in total disrepair and biting shortages of electricity and fuel\" as of 2024, according to VOA (report from AFP).[270] The country has a market-based mixed economy dominated by the petroleum sector,[271][272] which accounts for roughly a third of GDP, around 80% of exports, and more than half of government revenues. Per capita GDP for 2016 was estimated to be US$15,100, ranking 109th in the world.[18] Venezuela has the least expensive petrol in the world because the consumer price of petrol is heavily subsidized. The private sector controls two-thirds of Venezuela's economy.[273] A part of the Venezuelan economy depends on remittances. The Central Bank of Venezuela is responsible for developing monetary policy for the Venezuelan bolívar which is used as currency. The president of the Central Bank of Venezuela serves as the country's representative in the International Monetary Fund. The U.S.-based conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation claims Venezuela has the weakest property rights in the world, scoring only 5.0 on a scale of 100; expropriation without compensation is not uncommon. As of 2011, more than 60% of Venezuela's international reserves was in gold, eight times more than the average for the region. Most of Venezuela's gold held abroad was located in London. On 25 November 2011, the first of US$11 billion of repatriated gold bullion arrived in Caracas; Chávez called the repatriation of gold a \"sovereign\" step that will help protect the country's foreign reserves from the turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.[274] However government policies quickly spent down this returned gold and in 2013 the government was forced to add the dollar reserves of state owned companies to those of the national bank to reassure the international bond market.[275] Manufacturing contributed 17% of GDP in 2006. Venezuela manufactures and exports heavy industry products such as steel, aluminium and cement, with production concentrated around Ciudad Guayana, near the Guri Dam, one of the largest in the world and the provider of about three-quarters of Venezuela's electricity. Other notable manufacturing includes electronics and automobiles, as well as beverages, and foodstuffs. Agriculture in Venezuela accounts for approximately 3% of GDP, 10% of the labor force, and at least a quarter of Venezuela's land area. The country is not self-sufficient in most areas of agriculture.[citation needed] Since the discovery of oil in the early 20th century, Venezuela has been one of the world's leading exporters of oil, and it is a founding member of OPEC. Previously an underdeveloped exporter of agricultural commodities, oil quickly came to dominate exports and government revenues. The 1980s oil glut led to an external debt crisis and a long-running economic crisis, which saw inflation peak at 100% in 1996.[278] The 1990s also saw Venezuela experience a major banking crisis in 1994. The recovery of oil prices after 2001 boosted the Venezuelan economy and facilitated social spending. With social programs such as the Bolivarian Missions, Venezuela initially made progress in social development in the 2000s, particularly in areas such as health, education, and poverty. Many of the social policies pursued by Chávez and his administration were jump-started by the Millennium Development Goals, eight goals that Venezuela and 188 other nations agreed to in September 2000.[279] The sustainability of the Bolivarian Missions has been questioned due to the Bolivarian state's overspending on public works and because the Chávez government did not save funds for future economic hardships, with economic issues and poverty rising as a result of their policies in the 2010s.[32][280][281] In 2003 the government of Hugo Chávez implemented currency controls after capital flight led to a devaluation of the currency. This led to the development of a parallel market of dollars in the subsequent years. The Great Recession led to a renewed economic downturn. Despite controversial data shared by the Venezuelan government showing that the country had halved malnutrition following one of the UN's Millennium Development Goals,[114][282] shortages of staple goods began to occur in Venezuela and malnutrition began to increase.[114] In early 2013, Venezuela devalued its currency due to growing shortages in the country.[112][283] The shortages included, and still include, necessities such as toilet paper, milk, and flour.[113] Fears rose so high due to the toilet paper shortage that the government occupied a toilet paper factory, and continued plans to nationalize other industrial aspects like food distribution.[284][285] Venezuela's bond ratings have also decreased multiple times in 2013 due to decisions by the president Nicolás Maduro.[286] In 2016, consumer prices in Venezuela increased 800% and the economy declined by 18.6%, entering an economic depression.[287][288] Venezuela's outlook was deemed negative by most bond-rating services in 2017.[289][290] For 2018 an inflation rate of 1,000,000 percent was projected, putting Venezuela in a similar situation to that in Germany in 1923 or Zimbabwe in the late 2000s.[291] Tourism has been developed considerably in recent decades, particularly because of its favorable geographical position, the variety of landscapes, the richness of plant and wildlife, the culture and the tropical climate. Margarita Island is one of the top tourist destinations. It is an island with a modern infrastructure, bordered by beaches suitable for extreme sports, and features castles, fortresses and churches of great cultural value. Los Roques Archipelago is made up of a set of islands and keys that constitute one of the main tourist attractions in the country. With exotic crystalline beaches, Morrocoy is a national park, formed by small keys very close to the mainland, which have grown rapidly as one of the greatest tourist attractions in the Venezuelan Caribbean.[292] Canaima National Park[293] extends over 30,000 km2 to the border with Guyana and Brazil; due to its size it is considered the sixth largest national park in the world. Its steep cliffs and waterfalls (including Angel Falls, which is the highest waterfall in the world, at 1,002 m) form spectacular landscapes. The state of Mérida[294] is one of the main tourist centers of Venezuela. It has an extensive network of hotels not only in its capital city, but also throughout the state. Starting from the same city of Mérida is the longest and highest cable car in the world, which reaches the Pico Espejo of 4,765 m. Shortages in Venezuela have been prevalent following the enactment of price controls and other policies during the economic policy of the Hugo Chávez government.[295][296] Under the economic policy of the Nicolás Maduro government, greater shortages occurred due to the Venezuelan government's policy of withholding United States dollars from importers with price controls.[297] Shortages occur in regulated products, such as milk, various types of meat, coffee, rice, oil, flour, butter, and other goods including basic necessities like toilet paper, personal hygiene products, and even medicine.[295][298][299] As a result of the shortages, Venezuelans must search for food, wait in lines for hours and sometimes do without certain products.[300][301][302][303][304] A drought, combined with a lack of planning and maintenance, has caused a hydroelectricity shortage. To deal with lack of power supply, in April 2016 the Maduro government announced rolling blackouts[305] and reduced the government workweek to only Monday and Tuesday.[306] A multi-university study found that, in 2016 alone, about 75% of Venezuelans lost weight due to hunger, with the average losing about 8.6 kg (19 lbs) due to the lack of food.[307] In March 2017, Venezuela began having shortages of gasoline in some regions.[308] Venezuela has the largest oil reserves, and the eighth largest natural gas reserves in the world.[310] Compared to the preceding year another 40.4% in crude oil reserves were proven in 2010, allowing Venezuela to surpass Saudi Arabia as the country with the largest reserves of this type.[311] The country's main petroleum deposits are located around and beneath Lake Maracaibo, the Gulf of Venezuela (both in Zulia), and in the Orinoco River basin (eastern Venezuela), where the country's largest reserve is located. Besides the largest conventional oil reserves and the second-largest natural gas reserves in the Western Hemisphere,[312] Venezuela has non-conventional oil deposits (extra-heavy crude oil, bitumen and tar sands) approximately equal to the world's reserves of conventional oil.[313] The electricity sector in Venezuela is one of the few to rely primarily on hydropower, and includes the Guri Dam, one of the largest in the world. In the first half of the 20th century, U.S. oil companies were heavily involved in Venezuela, initially interested only in purchasing concessions.[314] In 1943 a new government introduced a 50/50 split in profits between the government and the oil industry. In 1960, with a newly installed democratic government, Hydrocarbons Minister Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonso led the creation of OPEC, the consortium of oil-producing countries aiming to support the price of oil.[315] In 1973, Venezuela voted to nationalize its oil industry outright, effective 1 January 1976, with Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) taking over and presiding over a number of holding companies; in subsequent years, Venezuela built a vast refining and marketing system in the U.S. and Europe.[316] In the 1990s PDVSA became more independent from the government and presided over an apertura (opening) in which it invited in foreign investment. Under Hugo Chávez a 2001 law placed limits on foreign investment. PDVSA played a key role in the December 2002 – February 2003 national strike. As a result of the strike, around 40% of the company's workforce (around 18,000 workers) were dismissed.[317] Venezuela is connected to the world primarily via air (Venezuela's airports include the Simón Bolívar International Airport in Maiquetía, near Caracas and La Chinita International Airport near Maracaibo) and sea (with major seaports at La Guaira, Maracaibo and Puerto Cabello). In the south and east the Amazon rainforest region has limited cross-border transport; in the west, there is a mountainous border of over 2,213 kilometres (1,375 mi) shared with Colombia. The Orinoco River is navigable by oceangoing vessels up to 400 kilometres (250 mi) inland and connects the major industrial city of Ciudad Guayana to the Atlantic Ocean. Venezuela has a limited national railway system, which has no active rail connections to other countries. The government of Hugo Chávez tried to invest in expanding it, but Venezuela's rail project is on hold due to Venezuela not being able to pay the $7.5 billion[clarification needed] and owing China Railway nearly $500 million.[318] Several major cities have metro systems; the Caracas Metro has been operating since 1983. The Maracaibo Metro and Valencia Metro were opened more recently. Venezuela has a road network of nearly 100,000 kilometres (62,000 mi), placing the country around 45th in the world;[319] around a third of roads are paved. The electricity sector in Venezuela is heavily dependent on hydroelectricity, with this energy source accounting for 64% of the country's electricity generation in 2021.[309] Venezuela is among the most urbanized countries in Latin America;[22][23] the vast majority of Venezuelans live in the cities of the north, especially in the capital Caracas, which is also the largest city. About 93% of the population lives in urban areas in northern Venezuela; 73% live less than 100 kilometres (62 mi) from the coastline.[320] Though almost half of Venezuela's land area lies south of the Orinoco, only 5% of Venezuelans live there. The largest and most important city south of the Orinoco is Ciudad Guayana, which is the sixth most populous conurbation.[321] Other major cities include Barquisimeto, Valencia, Maracay, Maracaibo, Barcelona-Puerto La Cruz, Mérida and San Cristóbal. According to the 2022 revision of the World Population Prospects[322][323] the total population was 28,199,867 in 2021. A 2014 study by sociologists of the Central University of Venezuela found over 1.5 million Venezuelans, or about 4% to 6% of the country's population, have left Venezuela since 1999.[324][325] The people of Venezuela come from a variety of ancestries. It is estimated that the majority of the population is of pardo, or mixed, ethnic ancestry. In the 2011 census, which Venezuelans were asked to identify themselves according to their customs and ancestry, the term pardo was excluded from the answers. The majority claimed to be moreno or white—51.6% and 43.6%, respectively.[1] Slightly more than half of the population claimed to be moreno, a term used throughout Ibero-America that in this case means \"dark-skinned\" or \"brown-skinned\", as opposed to having a lighter skin. Ethnic minorities in Venezuela consist of groups that descend mainly from African or Indigenous peoples; 2.8% identified themselves as \"black\" and 0.7% as afrodescendiente (Afro-descendant), 2.6% claimed to belong to Indigenous peoples, and 1.2% answered \"other races\".[1] Among Indigenous people, 58% were Wayúu, 7% Warao, 5% Kariña, 4% Pemón, 3% Piaroa, 3% Jivi, 3% Añu, 3% Cumanágoto, 2% Yukpa, 2% Chaima and 1% Yanomami; the remaining 9% consisted of other Indigenous nations.[326] According to an autosomal DNA study conducted in 2008 by the University of Brasília, the composition of Venezuela's population is 60.60% European, 23% Indigenous, and 16.30% African.[327] During the colonial period and until after the Second World War, many of the European immigrants to Venezuela came from the Canary Islands[328] and Spain[329] with a relevant amount of Galicians and Asturians. These immigrants from Spain had a significant cultural impact on the cuisine and customs of Venezuela.[330][331][332] These influences on Venezuela have led to the nation being called the 8th island of the Canaries.[333][334] With the start of oil exploitation in the early 20th century, companies from the United States began establishing operations in Venezuela, bringing with them U.S. citizens. Later, during and after the war, new waves of immigrants from other parts of Europe, the Middle East, and China began; many were encouraged by government-established immigration programs and lenient immigration policies.[335] During the 20th century, Venezuela, along with the rest of Latin America, received millions of immigrants from Europe.[336] This was especially true post-World War II, as a consequence of war-ridden Europe.[336][337] During the 1970s, while experiencing an oil-export boom, Venezuela received millions of immigrants from Ecuador, Colombia, and the Dominican Republic.[337] Due to the belief that this immigration influx depressed wages, some Venezuelans opposed European immigration.[337] The Venezuelan government, however, were actively recruiting immigrants from Eastern Europe to fill a need for engineers. Millions of Colombians, as well as Middle Eastern and Haitian populations would continue immigrating to Venezuela into the early 21st century.[335] According to the World Refugee Survey 2008, published by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, Venezuela hosted a population of refugee and asylum seekers from Colombia numbering 252,200 in 2007, and 10,600 new asylum seekers entered Venezuela in 2007.[338] Between 500,000 and one million illegal immigrants are estimated to be living in the country.[339] The total Indigenous population of the country is estimated at 500 thousand people (2.8% of the total), distributed among 40 Indigenous peoples.[340] There are three uncontacted tribes living in Venezuela. The Constitution recognizes the multi-ethnic, pluri-cultural, and multilingual character of the country and includes a chapter devoted to Indigenous peoples' rights, which opened up spaces for their political inclusion at national and local level in 1999. Most Indigenous peoples are concentrated in eight states along Venezuela's borders with Brazil, Guyana, and Colombia, and the majority groups are the Wayuu in the west, the Warao in the east, the Yanomami installed in the south, and the Pemon which are mostly in the southeast of Venezuela. Although most residents are monolingual Spanish speakers, many languages are spoken in Venezuela. In addition to Spanish, the Constitution recognizes more than thirty Indigenous languages, including Wayuu, Warao, Pemón, and many others for the official use of the Indigenous peoples, mostly with few speakers – less than 1% of the total population. Wayuu is the most spoken Indigenous language, with 170,000 speakers.[341] Immigrants, in addition to Spanish, speak their own languages. Chinese (400,000), Portuguese (254,000),[341] and Italian (200,000)[342] are the most-spoken languages in Venezuela after the official language of Spanish. Arabic is spoken by Lebanese and Syrian colonies on Isla de Margarita, Maracaibo, Punto Fijo, Puerto la Cruz, El Tigre, Maracay, and Caracas. Portuguese is spoken not only by the Portuguese community in Santa Elena de Uairén but also by much of the population due to its proximity to Brazil.[343] The German community speaks their native language, while the people of Colonia Tovar speak mostly an Alemannic dialect of German called alemán coloniero. English is the most widely used foreign language in demand and is spoken by many professionals, academics, and members of the upper and middle classes as a result of the oil exploration by foreign companies, in addition to its acceptance as a lingua franca. Culturally, English is common in southern towns like El Callao, and the native English-speaking (English-creole speaking) influence is evident in folk and calypso songs from the region. Various dialects of Eastern-Caribbean English-based creoles were brought to Venezuela by Trinidadian and other British West Indies immigrants,[344] they are collectively referred to as Venezuelan English Creole. A variety of Antillean Creole is spoken by a small community in El Callao and Paria.[345] Italian language teaching is delivered by private Venezuelan schools and institutions. Other languages spoken by large communities in the country are Basque and Galician, among others. Religion in Venezuela (2011)[346] According to a 2011 poll, 88% of the population is Christian, primarily Roman Catholic (71%), and the remaining 17% Protestant, primarily Evangelicals (in Latin America Protestants are usually called \"evangélicos\"). 8% of Venezuelans are irreligious. Almost 3% of the population follow another religion (1% of these people practice Santería).[346] There are small but influential Muslim, Druze,[347][348] Buddhist, and Jewish communities. The Muslim community of more than 100,000 is concentrated among persons of Lebanese and Syrian descent living in Nueva Esparta state, Punto Fijo and the Caracas area. Venezuela is home of the largest Druze communities outside the Middle East,[349] the Druze community are estimated around 60,000,[349] and concentrated among persons of Lebanese and Syrian descent.[350][347] Buddhism is practiced by over 52,000 people. The Buddhist community is made up mainly of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean people. The Jewish community has shrunk in recent years due to rising economic pressures and antisemitism in Venezuela,[351][352][353][354] with the population declining from 22,000 in 1999[355] to less than 7,000 in 2015.[356] Venezuela has a national universal health care system. The current government has created a program to expand access to health care known as Misión Barrio Adentro,[357][358] although its efficiency and work conditions have been criticized.[359][360][361] As of December 2014 an estimated 80% of Barrio Adentro establishments in Venezuela are abandoned.[362][363] Infant mortality in Venezuela was 19 deaths per 1,000 births for 2014 which was lower than the South American average (To compare: The U.S. figure was 6 deaths per 1,000 births in 2013).[18] Child malnutrition was 17%. Delta Amacuro and Amazonas had the nation's highest rates.[364] According to the United Nations, 32% of Venezuelans lacked adequate sanitation, primarily those living in rural areas.[365] Diseases ranging from diphtheria, plague, malaria,[249] typhoid fever, yellow fever, cholera, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis D were present in the country.[366] Obesity was prevalent in approximately 30% of the adult population.[18] Venezuela had a total of 150 sewage treatment plants; 13% of the population lacked access to drinking water, but this number had been dropping.[367][non-primary source needed] During the economic crisis observed under President Maduro's presidency, medical professionals were forced to perform outdated treatments on patients.[368] In 2008, 95.2% of the adult population was literate.[372] The net primary school enrollment rate was at 91% and the net secondary school enrollment rate was at 63% in 2005.[372] Venezuela has a number of universities, of which the most prestigious are the Central University of Venezuela founded in 1721, the University of Zulia, the University of the Andes, Simón Bolívar University, and the University of the East. Currently, many Venezuelan graduates seek a future abroad because of the country's troubled economy and heavy crime rate. Over 1.35 million Venezuelan college graduates have left the country since the beginning of the Bolivarian Revolution.[324][325] It is believed that nearly 12% of Venezuelans live abroad, with Ireland becoming a popular destination for students.[373] According to Claudio Bifano, president of the Venezuelan Academy of Physical, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences, more than half of all medical graduates had left Venezuela in 2013.[374] By 2018, over half of all Venezuelan children had dropped out of school, with 58% of students quitting nationwide while areas near bordering countries saw more than 80% of their students leave.[375][376] Nationwide, about 93% of schools do not meet the minimum requirements to operate and 77% do not have utilities such as food, water or electricity.[376] The culture of Venezuela is a melting pot made up of three main groups: The Indigenous Venezuelans, the Africans, and the Spanish. The Africans brought in many musical influences, especially introduction of the drum. The Spanish influence predominantes due to the colonization process and the socioeconomic structure it created. Spanish influences can be seen in the country's architecture, music, religion, and language. Venezuela was also enriched by immigration streams of Indian and European origin in the 19th century, especially from France. Most recently, immigration from the United States, Spain, Italy, and Portugal has enriched the already complex cultural mosaic.[citation needed] Carlos Raúl Villanueva[378] was the most important Venezuelan architect of the modern era; he designed the Central University of Venezuela, (a World Heritage Site) and its Aula Magna. Other notable architectural works include the Capitolio, the Baralt Theatre, the Teresa Carreño Cultural Complex, and the General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge. In Venezuela, prehistoric man began to build useful architecture from approximately 1000 BC to the 15th century AD, in the period known as the \"Neo-Indian\". Neo-Indian architecture consisted of incipient constructions, such as agricultural terraces and vaults lined by stones, called mintoyes, which were used as tombs and silos for the storage of agricultural products. The Indo-Hispanic architecture is the one that begins to develop from the year 1498 AD.[379] Venezuelan colonial architecture is built from the 16th century, when Venezuela began to be a dependent colony of the Spanish Empire,[380] until 1810, when the process of Venezuelan independence began. The architecture of this period is characterized by its discreet modesty, with the exception of some cities. The explanation lies in the socioeconomic conditions of the country. Venezuela did not offer then to the colonizers the immense riches kept by nature for later times. The simplification of technical problems, the renunciation of most of the decorative elements and variegated ostentations of fanciful baroque, the impossibility of using expensive materials and the consequent lack of craftsmen, contributed to establish a modest but well-defined physiognomy of the colonial architecture of Venezuela. During the colonial period, there were eventually confrontations between the Spanish conquerors and the barbarians and pirates that sailed along the Venezuelan coasts, in order to take over the provinces located on the coasts of the country. Christian temples from the colonial era were constituted by an almost invariable, arrangement consisting of a rectangular plan, three naves separated by arches of alfarje roofing composed of religious architecture in colonial times. The Venezuelan society dedicated a great amount of resources to erect religious monuments comparable to those of other countries of the continent. The XVII century was of reconstruction of the Catholic churches that had been destroyed by the earthquake of 1641. In the 18th century, specifically between 1728 and 1785, the prosperity that Venezuela enjoyed due to the opening of the Compañía Guipuzcoana de Caracas[381] was also reflected in the construction of new architecture, especially of a religious nature. Venezuelan art was initially dominated by religious motifs. However, in the late 19th century, artists began emphasizing historical and heroic representations of the country's struggle for independence.[382][383] This move was led by Martín Tovar y Tovar.[383][384] Modernism took over in the 20th century.[384] Notable Venezuelan artists include Arturo Michelena, Cristóbal Rojas, Armando Reverón, Manuel Cabré; the kinetic artists Jesús Soto, Gego and Carlos Cruz-Diez;[384] and contemporary artists such as Marisol and Yucef Merhi.[385][386] Venezuelan literature originated soon after the Spanish conquest of the mostly pre-literate Indigenous societies.[387] It was originally dominated by Spanish influences. Following the rise of political literature during the Venezuelan War of Independence, Venezuelan Romanticism, notably expounded by Juan Vicente González, emerged as the first important genre in the region. Although mainly focused on narrative writing, Venezuelan literature was advanced by poets such as Andrés Eloy Blanco and Fermín Toro. Major writers and novelists include Rómulo Gallegos, Teresa de la Parra, Arturo Uslar Pietri, Adriano González León, Miguel Otero Silva, and Mariano Picón Salas. The great poet and humanist Andrés Bello was also an educator and intellectual (He was also a childhood tutor and mentor of Simón Bolívar). Others, such as Laureano Vallenilla Lanz and José Gil Fortoul, contributed to Venezuelan Positivism. The Indigenous musical styles of Venezuela are exemplified by groups like Un Solo Pueblo and Serenata Guayanesa. The national musical instrument is the cuatro. Traditional musical styles and songs mainly emerged in and around the llanos region, including \"Alma llanera\" (by Pedro Elías Gutiérrez and Rafael Bolívar Coronado), \"Florentino y el diablo\" (by Alberto Arvelo Torrealba), \"Concierto en la llanura\" by Juan Vicente Torrealba, and \"Caballo viejo\" (by Simón Díaz). The Zulian gaita is also a very popular genre, generally performed during Christmas. The national dance is the joropo.[388] Venezuela has always been a melting pot of cultures and this can be seen in the richness and variety of its musical styles and dances: calipso, bambuco, fulía, cantos de pilado de maíz, cantos de lavanderas, sebucán, and maremare.[389] Teresa Carreño was a world-famous 19th century piano virtuoso. Recently, great classical music performances have come out of Venezuela. The Simón Bolívar Youth Orchestra has hosted a number of excellent concerts in many European concert halls, most notably at the 2007 London Proms, and has received several honors. The orchestra is the pinnacle of El Sistema, a publicly financed, voluntary music education program now being emulated in other countries. In the early 21st century, a movement known as \"Movida Acústica Urbana\" featured musicians trying to save some national traditions, creating their own original songs but using traditional instruments.[390][391] Some groups following this movement are Tambor Urbano,[392] Los Sinverguenzas, C4Trío, and Orozco Jam.[393] Afro-Venezuelan musical traditions are most intimately related to the festivals of the \"black folk saints\" San Juan and St. Benedict the Moor. Specific songs are related to the different stages of their festivals and processions, when the saints start their yearly \"paseo\" – stroll – through the community. The origins of baseball in Venezuela are unclear, although it is known that the sport was being played in the country by the late 19th century.[394] In the early 20th century, North American immigrants who came to Venezuela to work in the nation's oil industry helped to popularize the sport in Venezuela.[395] During the 1930s, baseball's popularity continued to rise in the country, leading to the foundation of the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League (LVBP) in 1945, and the sport would soon become the nation's most popular.[396][397] The popularity of baseball in the country makes Venezuela a rarity among its South American neighbors—association football is the dominant sport in the continent.[395][397][398] However, football, as well as basketball, are among the more popular sports played in Venezuela.[399] Venezuela hosted the 2012 Basketball World Olympic Qualifying Tournament and the 2013 FIBA Basketball Americas Championship, which took place in the Poliedro de Caracas. Although not as popular in Venezuela as the rest of South America, football, spearheaded by the Venezuela national football team is gaining popularity as well. The sport is also noted for having an increased focus during the World Cup.[399] Venezuela is scheduled to host the Copa América every 40 years.[400] Venezuela is also home to former Formula 1 driver, Pastor Maldonado.[401] Maldonado has increased the reception of Formula 1 in Venezuela, helping to popularize the sport in the country.[402] In the 2012 Summer Olympics, Rubén Limardo won a gold medal in fencing.[403] In the Winter Sports, Cesar Baena had represented the country since 2008 in Nordic Skiing, the first South American skier to compete in a FIS Cross Country Ski World Cup on Düsseldorf 2009. Los resultados arrojados por el censo poblacional realizado por el Instituto Nacional de Estadísticas en el 2011 demuestra que las poblaciones indígenas ha aumentado progresivamente con respecto al censo del año 2001. Según los datos estadísticos publicados por el INE, el total de población que se declaró indígena por sexo, arrojó un resultado de 50,46% hombre y 49,54% mujeres representando 365.920 hombres y 359.208 mujeres para un total de 725.148 personas que se declararon indígenas de Venezuela. Así mismo, se tomó el porcentaje de población por entidad donde el estado Zulia es la entidad con más indígenas con un 61%, seguido del estado Amazonas con 10%, Bolívar con un 8%, Delta Amacuro con 6%, Anzoátegui 5%, Sucre 3%, Apure y Monagas 2% mientras que en otras entidades existe un 3% de población indígena. Entre tanto, los pueblos indígenas con mayor población se encuentran los Wayuu 58%, Warao 7%, Kariña 5%, Pemón 4%, Piaroa, Jivi, Añu, Cumanágoto 3%, Yukpa, Chaima 2%, el pueblo Yanomami 1% y otros pueblos con un 9%. 7°N 65°W﻿ / ﻿7°N 65°W﻿ / 7; -65",

                "content": "Venezuela, officially the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, is a country in northern South America. The official language is Spanish, and the capital city is Caracas. Other languages spoken in Venezuela include Carib, Guahibo, Warao, Wayuu, Pemon, and Piaroa. The country has a wide range of geography that includes islands in the Caribbean Sea, coastal areas, highlands, and parts of the Andes Mountains. Venezuela is famous for being the home of Angel Falls, the world's tallest waterfall, in the Bolivar state. Venezuela's economy is based on oil, cotton, cocoa, sugar, coffee, and tobacco. Venezuela has one of the largest oil supplies in the world, and it produces a large amount of oil. It also has a very large supply of fossil fuels, gasoline, and minerals. Ancient Venezuelans came from the east, west, south, and north. Christopher Columbus was the first European to enter Venezuela, but there had been indigenous people living there for a long time. Also see: Colonialism and Atlantic slave trade When white Europeans (like the British, Spanish, and French colonial empires) conquered territory in the Americas, they took their black African slaves to America to work. The Spanish Empire conquered Venezuela and brought in slaves from Africa. At this time, black people had no rights; they just worked for food. Because of the colonial period, Venezuela's population today is very racially mixed. The Spanish taught Roman Catholicism, and many native people converted. Today, almost all Venezuelans (96%) are Catholics; just 2% are Protestant. For a long time, society was headed by white creoles: people in Venezuela who were descended from Spaniards, but considered Venezuela home. Other Venezuelans did not like that, and they started thinking about independence. On July 24, 1823 Venezuela won its independence, led by Simón Bolívar. Venezuela's modern history was shaped by a number of people, including President Romulo Betancourt, who replaced a military dictatorship with a democracy. By the 1970s, Venezuela had become rich from oil revenue, but it had problems in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1999 Hugo Chávez became president and tried to remake Venezuela into a socialist state. While popular at first, the economic changes made by Chavez and the next president, Maduro, caused a massive economic depression in the mid-2010s. The current president is disputed. The population of Venezuela is about 28,000,000 people.[7][8] The ethnicities of the population are:",

                "content": "Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are organizational frameworks which seek to promote the fair treatment and full participation of all people, particularly groups who have historically been underrepresented or subject to discrimination on the basis of identity or disability.[1] These three notions (diversity, equity, and inclusion) together represent \"three closely linked values\" which organizations seek to institutionalize through DEI frameworks.[2] The concepts predate this terminology and other variations sometimes include terms such as belonging, justice, and accessibility. As such, frameworks such as inclusion and diversity (I&D),[3] diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging (DEIB),[4][5][6] justice, equity, diversity and inclusion (JEDI or EDIJ),[7][8] or diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility (IDEA, DEIA or DEAI)[9][10][11] exist. Diversity refers to the presence of variety within the organizational workforce, such as in identity and identity politics. It includes gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, age, culture, class, religion, or opinion.[2][12] Equity refers to concepts of fairness and justice, such as fair compensation and substantive equality.[12] More specifically, equity usually also includes a focus on societal disparities and allocating resources and \"decision making authority to groups that have historically been disadvantaged\",[13] and taking \"into consideration a person's unique circumstances, adjusting treatment accordingly so that the end result is equal.\"[2] Finally, inclusion refers to creating an organizational culture that creates an experience where \"all employees feel their voices will be heard\",[2] and a sense of belonging and integration.[12][14] DEI is most often used to describe certain training efforts, such as diversity training. Although DEI is best known as a form of corporate training, it also finds implementation within many types of organizations, such as within academia, schools, and hospitals.[15][16] Into the 2020s, DEI efforts and policies have generated criticism, some directed at the specific effectiveness of its tools, such as diversity training, and its effect on free speech and academic freedom, as well as more broadly attracting criticism on political or philosophical grounds. In addition, the term \"DEI\" has gained traction as an ethnic slur towards minority groups in the United States.[17][18] DEI policy emerged from Affirmative action in the United States.[19] The legal term \"affirmative action\" was first used in \"Executive Order No. 10925\",[20] signed by President John F. Kennedy on 6 March 1961, which included a provision that government contractors \"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated [fairly] during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin\".[21] It was used to promote actions that achieve non-discrimination. In September 1965, President Lyndon Johnson issued Executive Order 11246 which required government employers to \"hire without regard to race, religion and national origin\" and \"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, color, religion, sex or national origin.\"[22] The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. Neither executive order nor The Civil Rights Act authorized group preferences. The Senate floor manager of the bill, Senator Hubert Humphrey, declared that the bill “would prohibit preferential treatment for any particular group” adding “I will eat my hat if this leads to racial quotas.” [23] However affirmative action in practice would eventually become synonymous with preferences, goals and quotas as upheld or struck down by Supreme Court decisions even though no law had been passed explicitly permitting discrimination in favor of disadvantaged groups. Some state laws explicitly banned racial preferences, and in response some laws have failed attempting to explicitly legalize race preferences. Affirmative action is intended to alleviate under-representation and to promote the opportunities of defined minority groups within a society to give them equal access to that of the majority population.[24] The philosophical basis of the policy has various rationales, including but not limited to compensation for past discrimination, correction of current discrimination, and the diversification of society.[25] It is often implemented in governmental and educational settings to ensure that designated groups within a society can participate in all promotional, educational, and training opportunities.[26] The stated justification for affirmative action by its proponents is to help compensate for past discrimination, persecution or exploitation by the ruling class of a culture,[27] and to address existing discrimination.[28] More recently concepts have moved beyond discrimination to include diversity, equity and inclusion as motives for preferring historically underrepresented groups. In the famous Bakke decision of 1978, Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, diversity now became a factor in constitutional law. The Supreme Court ruled quotas were illegal but it was allowable to consider race as a plus factor when trying to foster \"diversity\" in their classes.[29][30] Diversity themes gained momentum in the mid-1980s. At a time when President Ronald Reagan threatened to dismantle equality and affirmative action laws in the 1980s, equality and affirmative action professionals employed by US firms along with equality consultants, engaged in establishing the argument that a diverse workforce should be seen as a competitive advantage rather than just as a legal constraint. Basically, their message was, do not promote diversity because it is a legal mandate, but because it is good for business. From then on, researchers started to test a number of hypotheses on the business benefits of diversity and of diversity management, known as the business case of diversity.[31] In 2003, corporations spent $8 billion annually on diversity. In 2011 Barack Obama signed Executive Order 13583 concerning Diversity and inclusion.[32] After the election of Donald Trump in 2016 and the ascent of the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements, Time magazine stated in 2019 that the DEI industry had \"exploded\" in size.[33] Within academia, a 2019 survey found that spending on DEI efforts had increased 27 percent over the five preceding academic years.[34] One 2020 estimate placed the size of the global diversity and inclusion market at $7.5 billion, of which $3.4 billion was in the United States, projecting it to reach $17.2 billion by 2027.[35] In 2021, Joe Biden signed several executive orders concerning DEI, including Executive Order 13985 and Executive Order 14035.[32] In 2021, New York magazine stated \"the business became astronomically larger than ever\" after the murder of George Floyd in May 2020.[36] The Economist has also stated that surveys of international companies indicate that the number of people hired for jobs with \"diversity\" or \"inclusion\" in the title more than quadrupled since 2010.[37] As of 2024, affirmative action rhetoric has been increasingly replaced by emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion, while nine states explicitly ban its use in the employment process.[38][39] The Supreme Court in 2023 explicitly rejected affirmative action regarding race in college admissions in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard. The Court held that affirmative action programs \"lack sufficiently focused and measurable objectives warranting the use of race, unavoidably employ race in a negative manner, involve racial stereotyping, and lack meaningful end points. We have never permitted admissions programs to work in that way, and we will not do so today\".[40][41][42] In a 2018 article, proponents of DEI argued that because businesses and corporations exist within a larger world, they cannot be completely separated from the issues that exist in society. Therefore, the authors argue the need for DEI to improve coworker relations and teamwork.[43] Through a DEI plan, organizations outline measures to be taken, including recruiting and retaining personnel, fostering effective communication channels, imparting relevant training, and regulating workplace conduct.[44] As of 2022, many academic institutions in the US have also started making commitments to DEI in different ways, including creating documents, programs and appointing dedicated staff members especially in the US.[45][46] Many accreditation agencies now require supporting DEI.[47][48] As of 2014, information on DEI for both students and professors was widespread in colleges and universities, with many schools requiring training and meetings on the topic. Many scholarships and opportunities at universities even have a secondary purpose of encouraging diversity. Diversity in higher education can be difficult, with diverse students often feeling reduced to fulfilling a 'diversity quota,' which can carry a high emotional tax.[49] Within healthcare, DEI reflective groups have been used to enhance the cultural sensitivity within mental health professionals. Such reflective spaces help improve mental health professionals reflexivity and awareness of DEI-related issues both within direct clinical work with clients, their families, and wider systems, as well as within professional supervision and teams.[50] DEI positions also exist with the goal of creating allies for public school students through resources and staff training, in order to support students facing social disparities.[51][52] Other proponents of allyship consider impromptu speaking a key skill for allies to operate on authenticity in everyday words and reactions.[53] Diversity management as a concept appeared and gained momentum in the US in the mid-1980s. At a time when President Ronald Reagan threatened to dismantle equality and affirmative action laws in the US in the 1980s, equality and affirmative action professionals employed by US firms along with equality consultants, engaged in establishing the argument that a diverse workforce should be seen as a competitive advantage rather than just as a legal constraint. Basically, their message was, do not promote diversity because it is a legal mandate, but because it is good for business.[54] Following the murder of George Floyd in 2020, some companies made substantial commitments to racial equity by establishing dedicated diversity, equity, and inclusion teams.[55] In early 2024, the Washington Post reported that there is a trend in corporate America to reduce DEI positions and delegate the work to external consultants.[55] The number of DEI jobs reached its highest point in early 2023, but subsequently decreased by 5 percent that year and has further shrunk by 8 percent in 2024. The attrition rate for DEI roles has been approximately twice as high as that of non-DEI positions.[55] Companies that rolled back their DEI initiatives cited the 2023 Supreme Court's decision in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard and similar actions of other companies.[56] The scaling back of DEI initiatives has aligned with a rise in legal challenges and political opposition to systematic endeavors aimed at enhancing racial equity. Diversity management can be seen to \"leverage organisational diversity to enhance organisational justice and achieve better business outcomes\".[57] Several reports and academic studies, including one by McKinsey & Company, found a correlation between financial benefits and DEI.[58][59][self-published source?][60][61] The study from McKinsey & Company was criticized in a paper by Jeremiah Green & John R. M. Hand, who found the impact of DEI programs to be statistically insignificant.[62][63] At an aggregate level, a 2013 study found that birth country diversity of the labor force positively impacts a nation's long term productivity and income.[59]Firm-level research has provided conditional support to the proposal that workforce diversity per se brings business benefits with it. In short, whether diversity pays off or not depends on environmental factors, internal or external to the firm.[64][65][66][67] Recent work published in 2024, however, showed that there is a plausibly causal link (not only a correlation) between workforce gender diversity and financial performance in major firms.[68] Research suggests that attempts to promote diversity can provoke defensive responses: One study suggested that even incidental allusions to diversity during interviews promoted defensive reactions in White male applicants. Indeed, after diversity was mentioned, their performance during the interview deteriorated and their physiological arousal increased.[69] DEI can also be one component of environmental, social, and governance (ESG).[70] Since 2023, Republican-dominated state legislatures are considering bills that are against DEI efforts, primarily at state colleges and universities. The downgrading is taking place amid heavy legal pressures. Supreme Court in June 2023 upended established equal protection law with its decision in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard. This ruling, effectively eliminated the use of affirmative action in college admissions but did not directly affect employers. Nevertheless, since then conservative activists have organized in the states to dismantle race-conscious policies in various aspects of the economy. The Chronicle of Higher Education in February 2024 is tracking 73 bills introduced in state legislatures in 2023–2024. Of these 8 have become law, 25 failed to pass, and the rest are pending. Two bills became law in Florida and Texas; and one each in North Carolina, North Dakota, Tennessee, and Utah. Florida now prohibits public colleges from requiring “political loyalty tests” as a condition of employment, admission, or promotion. The other Florida law prohibits public colleges from spending state or federal funds on DEI unless required by federal law. One Texas law prohibits DEI practices or programs, including training, that are not in compliance with the state Constitution regarding equality. The other law bans DEI offices and staff, as well as mandatory diversity training. It also bans identity-based diversity statements that give preference regarding race or sex.[71] Within the film industry, several prominent actors and directors have criticized recently implemented diversity standards, such as at the Academy Awards. Beginning in 2024, to be eligible for a best-picture nomination at the Academy Awards, a film must meet two of four diversity standards in order to qualify.[72] Actor Richard Dreyfuss stated the Academy Award's diversity and inclusion standards \"make me vomit\", arguing that art should not be morally legislated.[73] Several major film directors, who are voting members of the Academy Awards, anonymously expressed their opposition to the new diversity standards to The New York Post, with one describing them as \"contrived\".[74] Film critic Armond White attacked the new standards as \"progressive fascism\", comparing them to the Hays Code.[75] Conservative media sources, such as National Review, have also been frequent critics of DEI, with contributor George Leff arguing it is authoritarian and anti-meritocratic.[76] In the 2020s, DEI came into the spotlight in American politics, especially in state legislatures in Texas and other Republican-controlled states.[77] Several states are considering or have passed legislation targeting DEI in public institutions. In March 2023, the Texas House of Representatives passed a bill with a rider banning the use of state funds for DEI programs in universities and colleges.[78] In May 2023, Texas passed legislation banning offices and programs promoting DEI at publicly funded colleges and universities.[79][80] In Iowa, a bill to ban spending on DEI in public universities was also advanced in March 2023.[81] Several prominent Republicans positioned themselves as critics, including Florida Governor Ron DeSantis,[82] Texas Governor Greg Abbott,[12] and 2024 presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy.[83] In January 2024, the Florida Board of Education banned federal or state money being used toward DEI programs in universities.[84] Another significant point of political controversy has been the implementation of DEI frameworks in the military, with Republican politicians frequently criticizing the efforts as \"divisive\" and as harming military efficiency and recruiting, while Democrats have defended it as beneficial and strengthening.[85] In July 2023, the House of Representatives voted to ban all DEI offices and initiatives within the Pentagon and military along partisan lines, with all Democrats and four Republican members also opposing. The Senate, under Democratic control, has not acted.[86][87] Political opposition to corporate DEI efforts in the United States, particularly marketing criticized as \"woke\", have led to calls for boycotts of certain companies by activists and politicians; with notable examples being Disney, Target, Anheuser-Busch,[88] and Chick-fil-A.[89][90] Commentator Jonathan Turley of The Hill described such boycotts as possessing \"some success\".[91] Some of these companies' responses to the controversies have, in turn, sparked criticism from progressives of \"walking back\" or failing DEI commitments.[92][93] A June 2024 poll by The Washington Post and Ipsos found that 6 in 10 Americans believed that diversity, equity, and inclusion programs are \"a good thing\".[94] A September 2024 poll by the Human Rights Campaign found that 80% of LGBT Americans would boycott a company that repealed its DEI programs and 19% would quit their job if their place of employment did.[95] According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, institutions are making defensive adjustments to the criticism. Some schools are removing the word \"diversity\" from titles of offices and jobs; some are closing campus spaces set up for students according to identity; some are ending diversity training; and some have stopped asking all faculty and staff members for written affirmations of their commitment to diversity.[96] Diversity training, a common tool used in DEI efforts, has repeatedly come under criticism as being ineffective or even counterproductive.[97][37][98][99] The Economist has stated that \"the consensus now emerging among academics is that many anti-discrimination policies have no effect. What is worse, they often backfire.\"[37] A regular claim is that these efforts mainly work to protect against litigation.[37][100] It has also been criticized that there has been limited progress in achieving racial diversity in corporate leadership, particularly for Black professionals, due to a lack of diverse Chief Diversity Officers and a broad DEI focus that overlooks specific issues Black professionals face.[101] A 2007 study of 829 companies over 31 years showed \"no positive effects in the average workplace\" from diversity training, while the effect was negative where it was mandatory.[100] According to Harvard University professor in sociology and diversity researcher Frank Dobbin, \"[O]n average, the typical all-hands-on-deck, 'everybody has to have diversity training' – that typical format in big companies doesn't have any positive effects on any historically underrepresented groups like black men or women, Hispanic men or women, Asian-American men or women or white women.\"[98] The use of mandatory \"diversity statements\" within academia, wherein an applicant or faculty member outlines their \"past contributions\" and plans \"for advancing diversity, equity and inclusion\" if hired, has become controversial and sparked criticism.[102] The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) has called such practices an attack on academic freedom, stating that \"[v]ague or ideologically motivated DEI statement policies can too easily function as litmus tests for adherence to prevailing ideological views on DEI\" and \"penalize faculty for holding dissenting opinions on matters of public concern\".[103] According to a 2022 survey conducted by the American Association of University Professors, one in five American colleges and universities include DEI criteria in tenure standards, including 45.6% of institutions with more than 5000 students.[104] Some universities have begun to weigh diversity statements heavily in hiring processes. For example, University of California, Berkeley eliminated three-quarters of applicants for five faculty positions in the life sciences exclusively on the basis of their diversity statements in the hiring cycle of 2018–2019.[105] Contrary arguments for training are that, \"implicit bias training is crucial for addressing racism, and bypassing it cannot be justified under the First Amendment. While free speech is a fundamental right, it is not absolute and must be balanced against public health needs, including combating systemic racism.\"[106] The Academic Freedom Alliance (AFA) has called for the end of required diversity statements, stating it \"encourages cynicism and dishonesty\" and erases \"the distinction between academic expertise and ideological conformity\".[107] Social psychologist Jonathan Haidt, who resigned from the Society for Personality and Social Psychology in protest against mandatory diversity statements, has stated that \"most academic work has nothing to do with diversity, so these mandatory statements force many academics to betray their quasi-fiduciary duty to the truth by spinning, twisting, or otherwise inventing some tenuous connection to diversity\".[108] Other criticisms include that it \"devalues merit\"; is connected to affirmative action; that it violates the First Amendment; or functions as a loyalty oath.[102][109][110][111] A 1,500-person survey conducted by FIRE reported that the issue is highly polarizing for faculty members, with half saying their view more closely aligns with the description of diversity statements as \"a justifiable requirement for a job at a university\", while the other half saw it as \"an ideological litmus test that violates academic freedom\".[112] According to Professor Randall L. Kennedy at Harvard University, \"many academics at Harvard and beyond feel intense and growing resentment against the DEI enterprise because of features that are perhaps most evident in the demand for DEI statements\", stating \"I am a scholar on the left committed to struggles for social justice. The realities surrounding mandatory DEI statements, however, make me wince\".[113] Several U.S. states have implemented legislation to ban mandatory diversity statements.[112] In 2024, MIT announced that diversity statements \"will no longer be part of applications for any faculty positions\" at the university, becoming the first major university to abandon the practice.[114] According to DEI frameworks, \"equity is different than equality in that equality implies treating everyone as if their experiences are exactly the same.\"[115] A common identification, especially among critics, is of equality as meaning \"equality of opportunities\" and equity as \"equality of outcome\".[116][117] This difference between equity and equality is also called Dilemma of Difference.[118] Some have criticized the focus on equity rather than equality, arguing that the former runs contrary to a focus on merit or non-discrimination. Political scientist Charles Lipson has called \"equity\" a \"mandate to discriminate\", threatening the principle of \"equality under the law\",[119] while Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson, a frequent critic of DEI, has called equity \"the most egregious, self-righteous, historically-ignorant and dangerous\" of the three titular notions of DEI.[120] The debate has also branched into the realm of politics. Commenting on Governor of Texas Greg Abbott calling DEI initiatives \"illegal\", a spokesperson for his office stated: \"The issue is not diversity – the issue is that equity is not equality. Here in Texas, we give people a chance to advance based on talent and merit.\"[12] In the 2020s, high-profile incidents of campus conflict have sparked debate about the effect of DEI on the campus environment, academic freedom, and free speech.[121][122][123] The 2021 cancelling of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) guest lecture by astrophysicist Dorian Abbot after he criticized DEI programs led to media attention and controversy.[124][125][126] As a result, MIT empaneled a committee to investigate the state of academic freedom at the university.[126] The 2023 disruption of a talk by Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Kyle Duncan at Stanford Law School sparked criticism and discussion in the media, with many focusing on the role of Associate DEI Dean Tirien Steinbach, who joined protesters in denouncing Duncan's presence on campus.[127][128][129] In the wake of the incident, the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal opined that DEI offices have \"become weapons to intimidate and limit speech\".[130] Steinbach replied with a piece entitled \"Diversity and Free Speech Can Coexist at Stanford\" that was published in the Journal the following week.[131][132] Dean of Stanford Law School Jenny S. Martínez also published a ten-page document addressing the situation and clarifying Stanford's position on free speech. In it, Martinez stated that the university's commitment to DEI \"can and should be implemented in ways that are consistent with its commitment to academic freedom and free speech\" and that she believed that \"the commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion actually means that we must protect free expression of all views.\"[133] She added that the commitment would not take the form of \"having the school administration announce institutional positions on a wide range of current social and political issues, make frequent institutional statements about current news events, or exclude or condemn speakers who hold views on social and political issues with whom some or even many in our community disagree.\" She criticized this definition of an \"inclusive environment\" by stating it \"can lead to creating and enforcing an institutional orthodoxy.\"[133] The 2023 suicide of former Toronto principal Richard Bilkszto led to a new wave of controversy surrounding DEI in the workplace and its impact on freedom of expression.[134][135] Bilkszto had earlier filed a lawsuit against the Toronto District School Board in the wake of a 2021 incident at a DEI training seminar; Bilkszto was later diagnosed with \"anxiety secondary to a workplace event\", and claimed the session and its aftermath had destroyed his reputation. Bilkszto's lawyer has publicly linked this incident and its aftermath with his death.[134][135] In the wake of Bilkszto's death, Ontario Minister of Education Stephen Lecce stated he had asked for a review and \"options to reform professional training and strengthen accountability on school boards so this never happens again\", calling Bilkszto's allegations before his death \"serious and disturbing\".[134] Bilkszto's death generated international attention and renewed debate on DEI and freedom of speech.[136][137] According to The Globe and Mail, the incident has also been \"seized on by a number of prominent right-wing commentators looking to roll-back [DEI] initiatives.\"[135] The anti-racism trainer involved in the incident has stated they welcome the review by Lecce, and stated that the incident has been \"weaponized to discredit and suppress the work of people committed [to DEI]\".[134][135] DEI has been criticized for not focusing on antisemitism.[138][139][140] According to Andria Spindel of the Canadian Antisemitism Education Foundation, antisemitism has been largely ignored in the DEI curriculum.[141] Tabia Lee, a former DEI director at De Anza College in California and DEI critic, has criticized DEI for what she says is fostering antisemitism.[142][143] According to the Brandeis Center, the DEI committee at Stanford University said that \"Jews, unlike other minority group[s], possess privilege and power, Jews and victims of Jew-hatred do not merit or necessitate the attention of the DEI committee\" after two students complained about antisemitic incidents on campus.[144] Following a wave of antisemitic incidents on American campuses in 2023–2024, several Republican congressmen laid the blame on DEI, with Burgess Owens stating DEI programs \"are anything but inclusive for Jews\".[145] DEI's lack of inclusion of Jews and contribution to antisemitism were similarly criticized by businessman Bill Ackman[146] and columnist Heather Mac Donald.[147] Following the 2023 United States Congress hearing on antisemitism at the University of Pennsylvania, one donor pulled a $100 million donation \"because he thought the school was prioritizing D.E.I. over enhancing the business school's academic excellence.\"[148] DEI has according to some critics[who?] become a distinct ideology or \"political agenda\", leading to a politicization of universities.[149] Fareed Zakaria, a commentator on CNN, has criticized American universities for \"[h]aving gone so far down the ideological path\" that \"these universities and these presidents cannot make the case clearly that at the center of a university is the free expression of ideas.\" He opines that \"[t]he most obvious lack of diversity at universities, political diversity, which clearly affects their ability to analyze many issues, is not addressed.\"[149] Conservative activists in the United States such as Stephen Miller and Edward Blum have alleged that corporate DEI programs are a form of reverse discrimination against whites. While such complaints have historically been a small fraction of employment discrimination litigation, U.S. courts have seen an increase in reverse discrimination claims since 2020, with some individual plaintiffs being awarded damages against companies such as Starbucks and Novant Health.[150] Author Christine Michel Carter coined the term \"dog-whistle diversity\" for Time in 2017.[151] Influenced by the phrase \"dog whistle politics\", dog whistle diversity is defined as the hiring of groups who have historically been underrepresented or subject to discrimination by organizations for the social aspect of environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG). To investors and stakeholders, hiring these groups sends a coded message that the organization is more open to a diverse workforce, but to the groups hired it suggests the organization lacks effective diversity management or inclusion.[151] According to some critics, DEI initiatives inadvertently sideline disabled people. Writing for The Conversation in 2017, college professor Stephen Friedman said that, \"Organizations who are serious about DEI must adopt the frame of producing shared value where business and social goods exist side-by-side\".[152] According to a Time article in 2023, \"People with disabilities are being neglected\".[153] This view has been echoed by a number of DEI leaders and activists. Sara Hart Weir, the former president and CEO of the National Down Syndrome Society and co-founder of the Commission for Disability Employment, argues that when deliberating on the vision of DEI success in the United States, policymakers, and employers need to take proactive measures to engaging with people with disabilities who they historically ignored.[154] Corinne Gray has argued that, \"If you embrace diversity, but ignore disability, you're doing it wrong.\"[155] Diversity hire,[156] equity hire, or DEI hire,[157] are disparaging and controversial labels for persons from underrepresented groups, which are, according to this label, assumed to be less qualified and have supposedly received preferential treatment due to DEI policies. Wording of some DEI initiatives can backfire and contribute to the self-perception of the hired person that they would not have been hired solely based on formal merit and have only been hired due to a combination of their underrepresented identity and formal merit.[158] The term diversity hire can refer to problematic hiring strategies such as tokenism.[156] The term \"DEI\", when used as a term to disparage people (particularly Black Americans), has been described as an ethnic slur.[17][18]",

                "title": "What Does Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Mean in the Workplace? | Built In",
                "content": "Many organizations implement DEI initiatives — here’s what that means, and why it matters. Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) refers to practices and policies intended to support people who come from varying backgrounds and give them the resources they need to thrive in the workplace. DEI frameworks take into account factors like race, gender and sexual orientation, so teams can find ways to help employees from marginalized groups succeed. Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) is a concept and practice used by organizations to recognize and value differences among people, ensure fair opportunities for everyone and foster a work environment where all feel welcomed and respected. DEI (sometimes referred to DE&I or IE&D) stands for diversity, equity and inclusion. As a discipline, DEI is any policy or set of initiatives designed to make people of various backgrounds feel welcome and ensure they have support to perform to the fullest of their abilities in the workplace. “We as employers need to make sure we’re including these individuals and that we’re giving them equity,” said Catalina Colman, former director of HR and inclusion at Built In. “We need to make sure that, not only do they have a job, but they have the same ability to get promoted, to contribute and have the same impact — in the world and in the workplace — as their peers.” This kind of environment is created by following all three aspects of DEI: Diversity is the presence of differences within a given setting. In the workplace, that can mean differences in race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age and socioeconomic class. It can also refer to differences in physical ability, veteran status, whether or not you have kids — all of those are components of diversity. Diversity in the workplace is important because with different backgrounds come different points of view, which ultimately leads to better ideas and solutions. “From a business standpoint, different perspectives directly influence a product — how it’s made, who it serves, how it functions and so on,” Colman said. “More perspectives make for a better product.” People from different backgrounds with varying life experiences will be able to provide new perspectives that help refine and enhance processes. “The more diverse voices there are in your organization, the better your outcomes will be, purely from a business standpoint,” Colman said. Even so, Colman urges employers to look beyond the business case: “I believe that if we give people the equitable opportunity to not only be employed, but to have employment with purpose and passion, our society can and will do great things. It’s a measurable good for everyone.” Equity is the process of ensuring that practices and programs are impartial, fair and provide equal possible outcomes for every individual. In order to ensure equal circumstances for all individuals across the organization, equity requires that employers recognize barriers and advantages. This is the crucial difference between “equity” and “equality.” “Equity takes into account the fact that not everybody is starting at the same level,” explained Colman. “Take home ownership, for example. A bank can make the statement that the loan application process is equal and that they will not discriminate based on race, gender or ethnicity. That doesn’t take into account student loans, familial debt, socioeconomic status.” These limitations are what define barriers and give rise to advantages, ultimately leading to an inequitable process. Inequity permeates every aspect of your business, requiring vigilance and swift action. “You’re not going to be able to build diversity if you’re not taking the steps to be more equitable,” Colman said. Companies that establish equitable environments not only support diverse workforces, but also incentivize employees to invest more energy and passion into their positions. “Equity is why we go to work,” explained Colman. “We want to get compensated fairly for our work, we want to be challenged, to learn and to contribute. People often choose an employer based on those things, which boil down to equity.” Inclusion is the practice of ensuring that people feel a sense of belonging in the workplace. This means that every employee feels comfortable and supported by the organization when it comes to being their authentic selves. While the workplace does require professionalism and etiquette, an inclusive culture should not bar individuals from being themselves. “Employees should not worry about code-switching or shielding part of their identity,” Colman said. “They should be able to walk through the door without feeling like something about them has to change.” Inclusion is what maintains diversity. Without it, employees will simply leave the organization. “If a candidate walks into a workplace and they’re the only woman or BIPOC employee, they’re going to question the employer’s authenticity and values,” Colman said. “People want to belong, plain and simple,” she added. “And marginalized individuals want to know that they’re not going to be the token person to represent a demographic. They shouldn’t have to worry about that in the workplace; they should be focused on how they’re going to have an impact within the company.” Boost your employer brand to the most targeted, most engaged and highest quality tech audience. DEI is vital to creating and maintaining a successful workplace, one founded on the principle that all people can thrive personally and professionally. Bringing together people of various backgrounds leads to new and creative ideas. More importantly, a DEI strategy contributes to a space where all employees feel they have intrinsic worth, not in spite of their differences but because of their differences. Below are a few more benefits businesses can enjoy upon embracing a DEI approach. DEI has grown in popularity among candidates and employees. In fact, three-fourths of job seekers and employees treat DEI as a major factor when weighing job offers and companies. Candidates recognize the positive effects of an environment that welcomes a range of backgrounds and want to join this kind of space. However, employees aren’t the only ones who should be pushing for more diverse and inclusive cultures. Company leaders must also make the effort to implement DEI policies, and there are plenty of incentives for businesses to get started as soon as possible. Once candidates join an organization, DEI can also play a role in convincing them to stick around. Feelings of inclusion make up as much as 35 percent of an employee’s emotional connection to their work and 20 percent of their wanting to remain with their current employer. Companies that take steps to cultivate a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace can then reduce employee turnover and enjoy a more stable workforce through the years. A Harvard Business Review survey of 79 large companies found that a 0.1-point increase in a company’s DEI ratings correlates to a 13-percent increase in that company’s ability to change. When companies construct inclusive teams, employees from diverse backgrounds can offer different ideas and perspectives. This makes it easier to solve problems, develop unorthodox approaches and craft creative solutions to help companies adapt on the fly. Trust hinges on leadership building genuine relationships with employees, and DEI is a key component of this process. When companies make DEI commitments and don’t follow through, 40 percent of workers would think about leaving and 56 percent would no longer recommend their employer as a place to work. Organizations that recruit diverse talent must execute DEI initiatives to make employees of different backgrounds feel respected and safe in the workplace. If businesses neglect their DEI commitments, employees of marginalized backgrounds may believe the company doesn’t care about them and lose the trust they once had in organizational leadership. Companies that listen to DEI advocates’ demands and make changes can benefit from a diverse and inclusive culture as well. According to Forbes, increasing female partners’ shares by 10 percent often leads to a 10 percent rise in revenue. In addition, firms that display culturally and ethnically diverse executive teams are 33 percent more likely to lead their industries in profitability. When people feel welcomed for who they are, they perform at a higher level. It’s a win-win situation for everyone when companies take steps to diversify their workforces. If your industry is ever going to be a place where innovation and ingenuity thrive, diversity, equity and inclusion have to take center stage. Employers must actively work to create meaningful change in spite of the history of injustice that has marginalized underrepresented groups within the workplace. This work is often spearheaded by HR departments. More on DEIWhat Is Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging (DEIB)? For employers and people management professionals alike, the biggest challenge is knowing where to start. “There’s no quick fix,” Colman said. “A lot of people immediately jump to figure out how they can make their company more diverse, but you can’t underestimate the importance of inclusion and equity. Without those two pieces, you’re not going to achieve true diversity.” Understanding how each element of DEI builds upon the others is important to creating a work environment that is equitable and inclusive of all individuals. Just like DEI is a multifaceted process, Colman encourages employers to lean on each other. “It’s not going to be a single HR person that addresses the issue of DEI for a company,” she added. “Lean on your professional community. You’re not going to be able to have all the answers because you don’t have all the perspectives.” The focus on DEI has prompted a huge shift for HR. “I think the mindset has always been to avoid talking about these things,” Colman said. “We typically put them in the handbook and address them in training maybe once a year. We didn’t want to make people uncomfortable. I think right now, the call to action is about understanding how to navigate that discomfort and how to use that to elevate your workforce. It’s about doing the important work that is long overdue and becoming inclusive and equitable.” Boost your employer brand to the most targeted, most engaged and highest quality tech audience. DEI stands for diversity, equity and inclusion. It is based on the idea that recruiting and supporting workers of various backgrounds is integral to a company’s success, and encompasses policies and initiatives designed to help all employees feel welcomed and equipped to perform their jobs at a high level. Intentionally recruiting workers of marginalized backgrounds, hosting DEI workshops and training sessions and offering mentorship and support to employees of diverse backgrounds are a few examples of DEI in the workplace. DEI is important because it contributes to an environment where all employees, regardless of background, have fair opportunities to pursue work they’re passionate about while getting to be themselves in the workplace. By bringing in diverse perspectives, organizations also create a space where multiple voices are heard and innovation can flourish. Not everyone agrees that DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) initiatives are good for workplaces, which has resulted in backlash. Some argue that DEI policies cost too much to implement or are ineffective. Others worry that DEI initiatives lead to poor hiring decisions or even discrimination against people who aren’t from underrepresented groups.",

                "title": "Ronald Reagan - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Ronald Wilson Reagan[a] (February 6, 1911 – June 5, 2004) was an American politician and actor who served as the 40th president of the United States from 1981 to 1989. He was a member of the Republican Party and became an important figure in the American conservative movement. His presidency is known as the Reagan era. Born in Illinois, Reagan graduated from Eureka College in 1932 and was hired the next year as a sports broadcaster in Iowa. In 1937, he moved to California where he became a well-known film actor. During his acting career, Reagan was president of the Screen Actors Guild twice, from 1947 to 1952 and from 1959 to 1960. In the 1950s, he hosted General Electric Theater and worked as a motivational speaker for General Electric. Reagan's \"A Time for Choosing\" speech during the 1964 presidential election launched his rise as a leading conservative figure. After being elected governor of California in 1966, he raised state taxes, turned the state budget deficit into a surplus and implemented harsh crackdowns on university protests. Following his loss to Gerald Ford in the 1976 Republican Party presidential primaries, Reagan won the Republican Party's nomination and then a landslide victory over President Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election. In his first term as president, Reagan began implementing \"Reaganomics\", which involved economic deregulation and cuts in both taxes and government spending during a period of stagflation. On the world stage, he escalated the arms race, increased military spending, transitioned Cold War policy away from the policies of détente with the Soviet Union, and ordered the 1983 invasion of Grenada. He also survived an assassination attempt, fought public-sector labor unions, expanded the war on drugs, and was slow to respond to the AIDS epidemic. In the 1984 presidential election, he defeated former vice president Walter Mondale in another landslide victory. Foreign affairs dominated Reagan's second term, including the 1986 bombing of Libya, the secret and illegal sale of arms to Iran to fund the Contras, and engaging in negotiations with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, which culminated in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. Reagan left the presidency in 1989 with the American economy having seen a significant reduction of inflation, the unemployment rate having fallen, and the U.S. having entered its then-longest peacetime expansion. At the same time, the national debt had nearly tripled since 1981 as a result of his cuts in taxes and increased military spending, despite cuts to domestic discretionary spending. Reagan's foreign policies also contributed to the end of the Cold War.[8] Though he planned an active post-presidency, it was hindered, after he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 1994, and his physical and mental capacities gradually deteriorated, leading to his death in 2004. His tenure constituted a realignment toward conservative policies in the United States, and he is often considered a conservative icon. Historical rankings of U.S. presidents have typically placed Reagan in the upper tier, and his post-presidential approval ratings by the general public are usually high.[9] Ronald Wilson Reagan was born on February 6, 1911, in an apartment in Tampico, Illinois, as the younger son of Nelle Clyde Wilson and Jack Reagan.[10] Nelle was committed to the Disciples of Christ,[11] which believed in the Social Gospel.[12] She led prayer meetings and ran mid-week prayers at her church when the pastor was out of town.[11] Reagan credited her spiritual influence[13] and he became a Christian.[14] According to American political figure Stephen Vaughn, Reagan's values came from his pastor, and the First Christian Church's religious, economic and social positions \"coincided with the words, if not the beliefs of the latter-day Reagan\".[15] Jack focused on making money to take care of the family,[10] but this was complicated by his alcoholism.[16] Reagan had an older brother, Neil.[17] The family lived in Chicago, Galesburg, and Monmouth before returning to Tampico. In 1920, they settled in Dixon, Illinois,[18] living in a house near the H. C. Pitney Variety Store Building.[19] Reagan attended Dixon High School, where he developed interests in drama and football.[20] His first job was as a lifeguard at the Rock River in Lowell Park.[21] In 1928, Reagan began attending Eureka College,[22] which Nelle approved because of its affiliation with the Disciples of Christ.[23] He was a mediocre student[24] who participated in sports, drama, and campus politics. He became student body president and joined a student strike that resulted in the college president's resignation.[25] Reagan was initiated as a member of Tau Kappa Epsilon Fraternity and served as president of the local chapter.[26] Reagan played at the guard position for the 1930 and 1931 Eureka Red Devils football teams and recalled a time when two Black teammates were refused service at a segregated hotel; he invited them to his parents' home nearby in Dixon and his parents welcomed them. At the time, his parents' stance on racial questions was unusually progressive in Dixon.[27] Reagan himself had grown up with very few Black Americans and was oblivious to racial discrimination.[28] After obtaining a Bachelor of Arts in economics and sociology from Eureka College in 1932,[29][30] Reagan took a job in Davenport, Iowa, as a sports broadcaster for four football games in the Big Ten Conference.[31] He then worked for WHO radio in Des Moines as a broadcaster for the Chicago Cubs. His specialty was creating play-by-play accounts of games using only basic descriptions that the station received by wire as the games were in progress.[32] Simultaneously, he often expressed his opposition to racism.[33] In 1936, while traveling with the Cubs to their spring training in California, Reagan took a screen test that led to a seven-year contract with Warner Bros.[34] Reagan arrived at Hollywood in 1937, debuting in Love Is on the Air (1937).[35] Using a simple and direct approach to acting and following his directors' instructions,[36] Reagan made thirty films, mostly B films, before beginning military service in April 1942.[37] He broke out of these types of films by portraying George Gipp in Knute Rockne, All American (1940), which would be rejuvenated when reporters called Reagan \"the Gipper\" while he campaigned for president.[38] Reagan starred in Kings Row (1942) as a leg amputee;[39] this performance was considered his best by many critics.[40] Reagan became a star,[41] with Gallup polls placing him \"in the top 100 stars\" from 1941 to 1942.[40] World War II interrupted the movie stardom that Reagan would never be able to achieve again[41] as Warner Bros. became uncertain about his ability to generate ticket sales. Reagan, who had a limited acting range, was dissatisfied with the roles he received. Lew Wasserman renegotiated his contract with his studio, allowing him to also make films with Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures, and RKO Pictures as a freelancer. Reagan appeared in multiple western films, something that had been denied to him while working at Warner Bros.[42] In 1952, he ended his relationship with Warner Bros.,[43] but went on to appear in a total of 53 films,[37] his last being The Killers (1964).[44] In April 1937, Reagan enlisted in the United States Army Reserve. He was assigned as a private in Des Moines' 322nd Cavalry Regiment and reassigned to second lieutenant in the Officers Reserve Corps.[45] He later became a part of the 323rd Cavalry Regiment in California.[46] As relations between the United States and Japan worsened, Reagan was ordered for active duty while he was filming Kings Row. Wasserman and Warner Bros. lawyers successfully sent draft deferments to complete the film in October 1941. However, to avoid accusations of Reagan being a draft dodger, the studio let him go in April 1942.[47] Reagan reported for duty with severe near-sightedness. His first assignment was at Fort Mason as a liaison officer, a role that allowed him to transfer to the United States Army Air Forces (AAF). Reagan became an AAF public relations officer and was assigned to the 18th AAF Base Unit in Culver City[48] where he felt that it was \"impossible to remove an incompetent or lazy worker\" due to what he felt was \"the incompetence, the delays, and inefficiencies\" of the federal bureaucracy.[49] Despite this, Reagan participated in the Provisional Task Force Show Unit in Burbank[50] and continued to make theatrical films.[51] He was also ordered to temporary duty in New York City to participate in the sixth War Loan Drive before being reassigned to Fort MacArthur until his discharge on December 9, 1945, as a captain. Throughout his military service, Reagan produced over 400 training films.[50] When Robert Montgomery resigned as president of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) on March 10, 1947, Reagan was elected to that position in a special election.[52] Reagan's first tenure saw various labor–management disputes,[53] the Hollywood blacklist,[54] and the Taft–Hartley Act's implementation.[55] Reagan aligned the union with the studios against the Conference of Studio Unions in the aftermath of the Hollywood Black Friday strike. In The Invisible Bridge, Rick Perlstein wrote that Reagan's actions lent legitimacy to the studio's efforts to crush the more radical union by giving liberals in SAG who did not want to strike \"a story that turned them into moral innocents instead of scabs.\"[56] On April 10, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) interviewed Reagan and he provided the names of actors whom he believed to be communist sympathizers.[57] During a House Un-American Activities Committee hearing, Reagan testified that some guild members were associated with the Communist Party[58] and that he was well-informed about a \"jurisdictional strike\".[59] When asked if he was aware of communist efforts within the Screen Writers Guild, he called information about the efforts \"hearsay\".[60] Reagan resigned as SAG president November 10, 1952, but remained on the board.[61] The SAG fought with film producers for the right to receive residual payments,[62] and on November 16, 1959, the board elected Reagan SAG president for the second time.[63] Reagan managed to secure payments for actors whose theatrical films had been released between 1948 and 1959 and subsequently televised. The producers were initially required to pay the actors fees, but they ultimately settled instead for providing pensions and paying residuals for films made after 1959. Reagan resigned from the SAG presidency on June 7, 1960, and also left the board.[64] In January 1940, Reagan married Jane Wyman, his co-star in the 1938 film Brother Rat.[65][66] Together, they had two biological daughters: Maureen in 1941,[67] and Christine in 1947 (born prematurely and died the following day).[68] They adopted one son, Michael, in 1945.[49] Wyman filed for divorce in June 1948. She was uninterested in politics, and occasionally recriminated, reconciled and separated with him. Although Reagan was unprepared,[68] the divorce was finalized in July 1949. Reagan would remain close to his children.[69] Later that year, Reagan met Nancy Davis after she contacted him in his capacity as the SAG president about her name appearing on a communist blacklist in Hollywood; she had been mistaken for another Nancy Davis.[70] They married in March 1952,[71] and had two children, Patti in October 1952, and Ron in May 1958.[72] Reagan has three grandchildren.[73] Reagan became the host of MCA Inc. television production General Electric Theater[43] at Wasserman's recommendation. It featured multiple guest stars,[74] and Ronald and Nancy Reagan, continuing to use her stage name Nancy Davis, acted together in three episodes.[75] When asked how Reagan was able to recruit such stars to appear on the show during television's infancy, he replied, \"Good stories, top direction, production quality\".[76] However, the viewership declined in the 1960s and the show was canceled in 1962.[77] In 1965, Reagan became the host[78] of another MCA production, Death Valley Days.[79] Reagan began his political career as a Democrat, viewing Franklin D. Roosevelt as \"a true hero\".[80] He joined the American Veterans Committee and Hollywood Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions (HICCASP), worked with the AFL–CIO to fight right-to-work laws,[81] and continued to speak out against racism when he was in Hollywood.[82] In 1945, Reagan planned to lead an HICCASP anti-nuclear rally, but Warner Bros. prevented him from going.[83] In 1946, he appeared in a radio program called Operation Terror to speak out against rising Ku Klux Klan activity, calling it a \"capably organized systematic campaign of fascist violence and intimidation and horror\".[84] Reagan supported Harry S. Truman in the 1948 presidential election,[85] and Helen Gahagan Douglas for the U.S. Senate in 1950. It was Reagan's belief that communism was a powerful backstage influence in Hollywood that led him to rally his friends against them.[81] Reagan began shifting to the right when he supported the presidential campaigns of Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 and Richard Nixon in 1960.[86] When Reagan was contracted by General Electric (GE), he gave speeches to their employees. His speeches had a positive take on free markets.[87] In 1961, Reagan adapted his speeches into another speech to criticize Medicare.[88] In his view, its legislation would have meant \"the end of individual freedom in the United States\".[89] In 1962, Reagan was dropped by GE,[90] and he formally registered as a Republican.[86] In the 1964 U.S. presidential election, Reagan gave a speech for presidential contender Barry Goldwater[91] that was eventually referred to as \"A Time for Choosing\".[92] Reagan argued that the Founding Fathers \"knew that governments don't control things. And they knew when a government sets out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose\"[93] and that \"We've been told increasingly that we must choose between left or right\".[94] Even though the speech was not enough to turn around the faltering Goldwater campaign, it increased Reagan's profile among conservatives. David S. Broder and Stephen H. Hess called it \"the most successful national political debut since William Jennings Bryan electrified the 1896 Democratic convention with his famous 'Cross of Gold' address\".[91] In January 1966, Reagan announced his candidacy for the California governorship,[95] repeating his stances on individual freedom and big government.[96] When he met with black Republicans in March,[97] he was criticized for opposing the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Reagan responded that bigotry was not in his nature[98] and later argued that certain provisions of the act infringed upon the rights of property owners.[99] After the Supreme Court of California ruled that the initiative that repealed the Rumford Act was unconstitutional in May, he voiced his support for the act's repeal,[100] but later preferred amending it.[101] In the Republican primary, Reagan defeated George Christopher,[102] a moderate Republican[103] who William F. Buckley Jr. thought had painted Reagan as extreme.[96] Reagan's general election opponent, incumbent governor Pat Brown, attempted to label Reagan as an extremist.[104] Reagan portrayed himself as a political outsider,[105] and charged Brown as responsible for the Watts riots and lenient on crime.[104] In numerous speeches, Reagan \"hit the Brown administration about high taxes, uncontrolled spending, the radicals at the University of California, Berkeley, and the need for accountability in government\".[106] Meanwhile, many in the press perceived Reagan as \"monumentally ignorant of state issues\", though Lou Cannon said that Reagan benefited from an appearance he and Brown made on Meet the Press in September.[107] Reagan won the governorship with 57 percent of the vote compared to Brown's 42 percent.[108] Brown had spent much of California's funds on new programs, prompting them to use accrual accounting to avoid raising taxes. Consequently, it generated a larger deficit,[109] and Reagan called for reduced government spending and tax hikes to balance the budget.[110] He worked with Jesse M. Unruh on securing tax increases and promising future property tax cuts. This caused some conservatives to accuse Reagan of betraying his principles.[111] As a result, taxes on sales, banks, corporate profits, inheritances, liquor, and cigarettes jumped. Kevin Starr states Reagan \"gave Californians the biggest tax hike in their history—and got away with it\".[112] In the 1970 gubernatorial election, Unruh used Reagan's tax policy against him, saying it disproportionally favored the wealthy. Reagan countered that he was still committed to reducing property taxes.[113] By 1973, the budget had a surplus, which Reagan preferred \"to give back to the people\".[114] In 1967, Reagan reacted to the Black Panther Party's strategy of copwatching by signing the Mulford Act[115] to prohibit the public carrying of firearms. The act was California's most restrictive piece of gun control legislation, with critics saying that it was \"overreacting to the political activism of organizations such as the Black Panthers\".[116] The act marked the beginning of both modern legislation and public attitude studies on gun control.[115] Reagan also signed the 1967 Therapeutic Abortion Act that allowed abortions in the cases of rape and incest when a doctor determined the birth would impair the physical or mental health of the mother. He later expressed regret over signing it, saying that he was unaware of the mental health provision. He believed that doctors were interpreting the provision loosely, resulting in more abortions.[117] After Reagan won the 1966 election, he and his advisors planned a run in the 1968 Republican presidential primaries.[118] He ran as an unofficial candidate to cut into Nixon's southern support and be a compromise candidate if there were to be a brokered convention. He won California's delegates,[119] but Nixon secured enough delegates for the nomination.[120] Reagan had previously been critical of former governor Brown and university administrators for tolerating student demonstrations in the city of Berkeley, making it a major theme in his campaigning.[121] On February 5, 1969, Reagan declared a state of emergency in response to ongoing protests and violence at the University of California, Berkeley, and sent in the California Highway Patrol. In May 1969, these officers, along with local officers from Berkeley and Alameda county, clashed with protestors over a site known as the People's Park.[122][123] One student was shot and killed while many police officers and two reporters were injured. Reagan then commanded the state National Guard troops to occupy Berkeley for seventeen days to subdue the protesters, allowing other students to attend class safely. In February 1970, violent protests broke out near the University of California, Santa Barbara, where he once again deployed the National Guard. On April 7, Reagan defended his policies regarding campus protests, saying, \"If it takes a bloodbath, let's get it over with. No more appeasement\".[124] During his victorious reelection campaign in 1970, Reagan, remaining critical of government, promised to prioritize welfare reform.[125] He was concerned that the programs were disincentivizing work and that the growing welfare rolls would lead to both an unbalanced budget and another big tax hike in 1972.[126] At the same time, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates to combat inflation, putting the American economy in a mild recession. Reagan worked with Bob Moretti to tighten up the eligibility requirements so that the financially needy could continue receiving payments. This was only accomplished after Reagan softened his criticism of Nixon's Family Assistance Plan. Nixon then lifted regulations to shepherd California's experiment.[127] In 1976, the Employment Development Department published a report suggesting that the experiment that ran from 1971 to 1974 was unsuccessful.[128] Reagan declined to run for the governorship in 1974 and it was won by Pat Brown's son, Jerry.[129] Reagan's governorship, as professor Gary K. Clabaugh writes, saw public schools deteriorate due to his opposition to additional basic education funding.[130] As for higher education, journalist William Trombley believed that the budget cuts Reagan enacted damaged Berkeley's student-faculty ratio and research.[131] The homicide rate doubled and armed robbery rates rose by even more during Reagan's eight years, even with the many laws Reagan signed to try toughening criminal sentencing and reforming the criminal justice system.[132] Reagan strongly supported capital punishment, but his efforts to enforce it were thwarted by People v. Anderson in 1972.[133] According to his son, Michael, Reagan said that he regretted signing the Family Law Act that granted no-fault divorces.[134] Insufficiently conservative to Reagan[135] and many other Republicans,[136] President Gerald Ford suffered from multiple political and economic woes. Ford, running for president, was disappointed to hear him also run.[137] Reagan was strongly critical of détente and Ford's policy of détente with the Soviet Union.[138] He repeated \"A Time for Choosing\" around the country[139] before announcing his campaign on November 20, 1975, when he discussed economic and social problems, and to a lesser extent, foreign affairs.[140] Both candidates were determined to knock each other out early in the primaries,[141] but Reagan would devastatingly lose the first five primaries beginning with New Hampshire,[142] where he popularized the welfare queen narrative about Linda Taylor, exaggerating her misuse of welfare benefits and igniting voter resentment for welfare reform,[143] but never overtly mentioning her name or race.[144] In Florida, Reagan referred to a \"strapping young buck\",[145] which became an example of dog whistle politics,[146] and attacked Ford for handing the Panama Canal to Panama's government while Ford implied that he would end Social Security.[142] Then, in Illinois, he again criticized Ford's policy and his secretary of state, Henry Kissinger.[147] Losing the first five primaries prompted Reagan to desperately win North Carolina's by running a grassroots campaign and uniting with the Jesse Helms political machine that viciously attacked Ford. Reagan won an upset victory, convincing party delegates that Ford's nomination was no longer guaranteed.[148] Reagan won subsequent victories in Texas, Alabama, Georgia, and Indiana with his attacks on social programs, opposition to forced busing, increased support from inclined voters of a declining George Wallace campaign for the Democratic nomination,[149] and repeated criticisms of Ford and Kissinger's policies, including détente.[150] The result was a seesaw battle for the 1,130 delegates required for their party's nomination that neither would reach before the Kansas City convention[151] in August[152] and Ford replacing mentions of détente with Reagan's preferred phrase, \"peace through strength\".[153] Reagan took John Sears' advice of choosing liberal Richard Schweiker as his running mate, hoping to pry loose of delegates from Pennsylvania and other states,[154] and distract Ford. Instead, conservatives were left alienated, and Ford picked up the remaining uncommitted delegates, earning 1,187 to Reagan's 1,070. Before giving his acceptance speech, Ford invited Reagan to address the convention; Reagan emphasized individual freedom[155] and the dangers of nuclear weapons. In 1977, Ford told Cannon that Reagan's primary challenge contributed to his own narrow loss to Democrat Jimmy Carter in the 1976 presidential election.[156] Reagan emerged as a vocal critic of President Carter in 1977. The Panama Canal Treaty's signing, the 1979 oil crisis, and rise in the interest, inflation and unemployment rates helped set up his 1980 presidential campaign,[157] which he announced on November 13, 1979[158] with an indictment of the federal government.[159] His announcement stressed his fundamental principles of tax cuts to stimulate the economy and having both a small government and a strong national defense,[160] since he believed the United States was behind the Soviet Union militarily.[161] Heading into 1980, his age became an issue among the press, and the United States was in a severe recession.[162] In the primaries, Reagan unexpectedly lost the Iowa caucus to George H. W. Bush. Three days before the New Hampshire primary, the Reagan and Bush campaigns agreed to a one-on-one debate sponsored by The Telegraph at Nashua, New Hampshire, but hours before the debate, the Reagan campaign invited other candidates including Bob Dole, John B. Anderson, Howard Baker and Phil Crane.[163] Debate moderator Jon Breen denied seats to the other candidates, asserting that The Telegraph would violate federal campaign contribution laws if it sponsored the debate and changed the ground rules hours before the debate.[164] As a result, the Reagan campaign agreed to pay for the debate. Reagan said that as he was funding the debate, he could decide who would debate.[165] During the debate, when Breen was laying out the ground rules and attempting to ask the first question, Reagan interrupted in protest to make an introductory statement and wanted other candidates to be included before the debate began.[166] The moderator asked Bob Malloy, the volume operator, to mute Reagan's microphone. After Breen repeated his demand to Malloy, Reagan furiously replied, \"I am paying for this microphone, Mr. Green! [sic]\".[b][168] This turned out to be the turning point of the debate and the primary race.[169] Ultimately, the four additional candidates left, and the debate continued between Reagan and Bush. Reagan's polling numbers improved, and he won the New Hampshire primary by more than 39,000 votes.[170] Soon thereafter, Reagan's opponents began dropping out of the primaries, including Anderson, who left the party to become an independent candidate. Reagan easily captured the presidential nomination and chose Bush as his running mate at the Detroit convention in July.[171] The general election pitted Reagan against Carter amid the multitude of domestic concerns and ongoing Iran hostage crisis that began on November 4, 1979.[172] Reagan's campaign worried that Carter would be able to secure the release of the American hostages in Iran as part of the October surprise,[173] Carter \"suggested that Reagan would wreck Social Security\" and portrayed him as a warmonger,[174] and Anderson carried support from liberal Republicans dissatisfied with Reagan's conservatism.[173][c] One of Reagan's key strengths was his appeal to the rising conservative movement. Though most conservative leaders espoused cutting taxes and budget deficits, many conservatives focused more closely on social issues like abortion and gay rights.[176] Evangelical Protestants became an increasingly important voting bloc, and they generally supported Reagan.[177] Reagan also won the backing of Reagan Democrats.[178] Though he advocated socially conservative viewpoints, Reagan focused much of his campaign on attacks against Carter's foreign policy.[179] In August, Reagan gave a speech at the Neshoba County Fair, stating his belief in states' rights. Joseph Crespino argues that the visit was designed to reach out to Wallace-inclined voters,[180] and some[who?] also saw these actions as an extension of the Southern strategy to garner white support for Republican candidates.[181] Reagan's supporters have said that this was his typical anti-big government rhetoric, without racial context or intent.[182][183][184] In the October 28 debate, Carter chided Reagan for being against national health insurance. Reagan replied, \"There you go again\", though the audience laughed and viewers found him more appealing.[185] Reagan later asked the audience if they were better off than they were four years ago, slightly paraphrasing Roosevelt's words in 1934.[186] In 1983, Reagan's campaign managers were revealed to having obtained Carter's debate briefing book before the debates.[187] On November 4, 1980, Reagan won in a decisive victory in the Electoral College over Carter, carrying 44 states and receiving 489 electoral votes to Carter's 49 in six states and the District of Columbia. He won the popular vote by a narrower margin, receiving nearly 51 percent to Carter's 41 percent and Anderson's 7 percent. Republicans won a majority of seats in the Senate for the first time since 1952[188] while Democrats retained the House of Representatives.[189] Reagan was inaugurated as the 40th president of the United States on January 20, 1981.[190] Chief Justice Warren E. Burger administered the presidential oath of office.[191] In his inaugural address, Reagan commented on the country's economic malaise, arguing, \"In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem\".[192] As a final insult to President Carter, Iran waited until Reagan had been sworn in before announcing the release of their American hostages.[193][194] Reagan advocated a laissez-faire philosophy,[195] and promoted a set of neoliberal reforms dubbed \"Reaganomics\", which included monetarism and supply-side economics.[196] Reagan worked with the boll weevil Democrats to pass tax and budget legislation in a Congress led by Tip O'Neill, a liberal who strongly criticized Reaganomics.[197][d] He lifted federal oil and gasoline price controls on January 28, 1981,[199] and in August, he signed the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981[200] to dramatically lower federal income tax rates and require exemptions and brackets to be indexed for inflation starting in 1985.[201] Amid growing concerns about the mounting federal debt, Reagan signed the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982,[202] one of the eleven times Reagan raised taxes.[203] The bill doubled the federal cigarette tax, rescinded a portion of the corporate tax cuts from the 1981 tax bill,[204] and according to Paul Krugman, \"a third of the 1981 cut\" overall.[205] Many of his supporters condemned the bill, but Reagan defended his preservation of cuts on individual income tax rates.[206] By 1983, the amount of federal tax had fallen for all or most taxpayers, with taxes for higher-income people decreasing the most.[207] The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced the number of tax brackets and top tax rate, and almost doubled personal exemptions.[208] To Reagan, the tax cuts would not have increased the deficit as long as there was enough economic growth and spending cuts. His policies proposed that economic growth would occur when the tax cuts spurred investments. This theoretical relationship has been illustrated by some with the controversial Laffer curve.[209] Critics labeled this \"trickle-down economics\", the belief that tax policies that benefit the wealthy will spread to the poor.[210] Milton Friedman and Robert Mundell argued that these policies invigorated America's economy and contributed to the economic boom of the 1990s.[211] Reagan took office in the midst of stagflation.[212] The economy briefly experienced growth before plunging into a recession in July 1981.[213] As Federal Reserve chairman, Paul Volcker fought inflation by pursuing a tight money policy of high interest rates,[214] which restricted lending and investment, raised unemployment, and temporarily reduced economic growth.[215] In December 1982, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) measured the unemployment rate at 10.8 percent.[216] Around the same time, economic activity began to rise until its end in 1990, setting the record for the longest peacetime expansion.[217] In 1983, the recession ended[218] and Reagan nominated Volcker to a second term in fear of damaging confidence in the economic recovery.[219] Reagan appointed Alan Greenspan to succeed Volcker in 1987. Greenspan raised interest rates in another attempt to curb inflation, setting off the Black Monday stock market crash, although the markets eventually recovered.[220] By 1989, the BLS measured unemployment at 5.3 percent.[221] The inflation rate dropped from 12 percent during the 1980 election to under 5 percent in 1989. Likewise, the interest rate dropped from 15 percent to under 10 percent.[222] Yet, not all shared equally in the economic recovery, and both economic inequality[223] and the number of homeless individuals increased during the 1980s.[224] Critics have contended that a majority of the jobs created during this decade paid the minimum wage.[225] In 1981, in an effort to keep it solvent, Reagan approved a plan for cuts to Social Security. He later backed off due to public backlash.[226] He then created the Greenspan Commission to keep Social Security financially secure, and in 1983 he signed amendments to raise both the program's payroll taxes and retirement age for benefits.[227] He had signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 to cut funding for federal assistance such as food stamps, unemployment benefits, subsidized housing and the Aid to Families with Dependent Children,[228] and would discontinue the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act.[229] On the other side, defense spending doubled between 1981 and 1985.[161] During Reagan's presidency, Project Socrates operated within the Defense Intelligence Agency to discover why the United States was unable to maintain its economic competitiveness. According to program director Michael Sekora, their findings helped the country surpass the Soviets in terms of missile defense technology.[230][231] Reagan sought to loosen federal regulation of economic activities, and he appointed key officials who shared this agenda. William Leuchtenburg writes that by 1986, the Reagan administration eliminated almost half of the federal regulations that had existed in 1981.[232] The 1982 Garn–St. Germain Depository Institutions Act deregulated savings and loan associations by letting them make a variety of loans and investments outside of real estate.[233] After the bill's passage, savings and loans associations engaged in riskier activities, and the leaders of some institutions embezzled funds. The administration's inattentiveness toward the industry contributed to the savings and loan crisis and costly bailouts.[234] The deficits were exacerbated by the early 1980s recession, which cut into federal revenue.[235] The national debt tripled between the fiscal years of 1980 and 1989, and the national debt as a percentage of the gross domestic product rose from 33 percent in 1981 to 53 percent by 1989. During his time in office, Reagan never fulfilled his 1980 campaign promise of submitting a balanced budget. The United States borrowed heavily to cover newly spawned federal budget deficits.[236] Reagan described the tripled debt the \"greatest disappointment of his presidency\".[237] Jeffrey Frankel opined that the deficits were a major reason why Reagan's successor, Bush, reneged on his campaign promise by raising taxes through the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990.[238] On March 30, 1981, Reagan was shot by John Hinckley Jr. outside the Washington Hilton. Although \"right on the margin of death\" upon arrival at George Washington University Hospital, Reagan underwent surgery and recovered quickly from a broken rib, punctured lung, and internal bleeding. Professor J. David Woodard says that the assassination attempt \"created a bond between him and the American people that was never really broken\".[239] Later, Reagan came to believe that God had spared his life \"for a chosen mission\".[240] Reagan appointed three Associate Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States: Sandra Day O'Connor in 1981, which fulfilled a campaign promise to name the first female justice to the Court, Antonin Scalia in 1986, and Anthony Kennedy in 1988. He also elevated William Rehnquist from Associate Justice to Chief Justice in 1986.[241] The direction of the Supreme Court's reshaping has been described as conservative.[242][243] Early in August 1981, the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO) went on strike, violating a federal law prohibiting government unions from striking.[244] On August 3, Reagan said that he would fire air traffic controllers if they did not return to work within 48 hours; according to him, 38 percent did not return. On August 13, Reagan fired roughly 12,000 striking air traffic controllers who ignored his order.[245] He used military controllers[246] and supervisors to handle the nation's commercial air traffic until new controllers could be hired and trained.[247] The breaking of the PATCO strike demoralized organized labor, and the number of strikes fell greatly in the 1980s.[246] With the assent of Reagan's sympathetic National Labor Relations Board appointees, many companies also won wage and benefit cutbacks from unions, especially in the manufacturing sector.[248] During Reagan's presidency, the share of employees who were part of a labor union dropped from approximately one-fourth of the total workforce to approximately one-sixth of the total workforce.[249] Despite Reagan having opposed the Voting Rights Act of 1965,[33] the bill was extended for 25 years in 1982.[250] He initially opposed the establishment of Martin Luther King Jr. Day,[251] and alluded to claims that King was associated with communists during his career, but signed a bill to create the holiday in 1983 after it passed both houses of Congress with veto-proof margins.[252] In 1984, he signed legislation intended to impose fines for fair housing discrimination offenses.[253] In March 1988, Reagan vetoed the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, but Congress overrode his veto. He had argued that the bill unreasonably increased the federal government's power and undermined the rights of churches and business owners.[254] Later in September, legislation was passed to correct loopholes in the Fair Housing Act of 1968.[255][256] Early in his presidency, Reagan appointed Clarence M. Pendleton Jr., known for his opposition to affirmative action and equal pay for men and women, as chair of the United States Commission on Civil Rights. Pendleton and Reagan's subsequent appointees greatly eroded the enforcement of civil rights law, arousing the ire of civil rights advocates.[257] In 1987, Reagan unsuccessfully nominated Robert Bork to the Supreme Court as a way to achieve his civil rights policy that could not be fulfilled during his presidency; his administration had opposed affirmative action, particularly in education, federal assistance programs, housing and employment,[258] but Reagan reluctantly continued these policies.[259] In housing, Reagan's administration saw considerably fewer fair housing cases filed than the three previous administrations.[260] In response to concerns about the increasing crack epidemic, Reagan intensified the war on drugs in 1982.[261] While the American public did not see drugs as an important issue then, the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration and the United States Department of Defense all increased their anti-drug funding immensely.[262] Reagan's administration publicized the campaign to gain support after crack became widespread in 1985.[263] Reagan signed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 and 1988 to specify penalties for drug offenses.[264] Both bills have been criticized in the years since for promoting racial disparities.[265] Nancy Reagan founded the \"Just Say No\" campaign to discourage others from engaging in recreational drug use and raise awareness about the dangers of drugs.[266] A 1988 study showed 39 percent of high school seniors using illegal drugs compared to 53 percent in 1980,[267] but Scott Lilienfeld and Hal Arkowitz say that the success of these types of campaigns has not been affirmatively proven.[268] Reagan ordered a massive defense buildup;[269] he revived the B-1 Lancer program that had been rejected by the Carter administration,[270] and deployed the MX missile.[271] In response to Soviet deployment of the SS-20, he oversaw NATO's deployment of the Pershing missile in Western Europe.[272] In 1982, Reagan tried to cut off the Soviet Union's access to hard currency by impeding its proposed gas line to Western Europe. It hurt the Soviet economy, but it also caused ill will among American allies in Europe who counted on that revenue; he later retreated on this issue.[273] In March 1983, Reagan introduced the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) to protect the United States from space intercontinental ballistic missiles. He believed that this defense shield could protect the country from nuclear destruction in a hypothetical nuclear war with the Soviet Union.[274] There was much disbelief among the scientific community surrounding the program's scientific feasibility, leading opponents to dub the SDI \"Star Wars\",[275] although Soviet leader Yuri Andropov said it would lead to \"an extremely dangerous path\".[276] In a 1982 address to the British Parliament, Reagan said, \"the march of freedom and democracy... will leave Marxism–Leninism on the ash heap of history\". Dismissed by the American press as \"wishful thinking\", Margaret Thatcher called the address a \"triumph\".[277] David Cannadine says of Thatcher that \"Reagan had been grateful for her interest in him at a time when the British establishment refused to take him seriously\", with the two agreeing on \"building up stronger defenses against Soviet Russia\" and both believing in outfacing \"what Reagan would later call 'the evil empire'\",[278] in reference to the Soviet Union, during a speech to the National Association of Evangelicals in March 1983.[233] After Soviet fighters downed Korean Air Lines Flight 007 in September, which included Congressman Larry McDonald and 61 other Americans, Reagan expressed outrage towards the Soviet Union.[279] The next day, reports suggested that the Soviets had fired on the plane by mistake.[280] In spite of the harsh, discordant rhetoric,[281] Reagan's administration continued discussions with the Soviet Union on START I.[282] Although the Reagan administration agreed with the communist government in China to reduce the sale of arms to Taiwan in 1982,[283] Reagan himself was the first president to reject containment and détente, and to put into practice the concept that the Soviet Union could be defeated rather than simply negotiated with.[284] His covert aid to Afghan mujahideen forces through Pakistan against the Soviets has been given credit for assisting in ending the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan;[285] however, the United States was subjected to blowback in the form of the Taliban that opposed them in the war in Afghanistan.[286] In his 1985 State of the Union Address, Reagan proclaimed, \"Support for freedom fighters is self-defense.\"[287] Through the Reagan Doctrine, his administration supported anti-communist movements that fought against groups backed by the Soviet Union in an effort to rollback Soviet-backed communist governments and reduce Soviet influence across the world.[288] The Reagan administration ignored human rights violations in the countries they backed and held a narrow definition of human rights.[289] Other human rights concerns include the genocide in Guatemala,[290] as well as mass killings in Chad.[291] On October 19, 1983, Maurice Bishop was overthrown and murdered by one of his colleagues. Several days later, Reagan ordered American forces to invade Grenada. Reagan cited a regional threat posed by a Soviet-Cuban military build-up and concern for the safety of hundreds of American medical students at St. George's University. Two days of fighting commenced, resulting in an American victory.[292] While the invasion enjoyed public support in the United States, it was criticized internationally, with the United Nations General Assembly voting to censure the American government.[293] Cannon later noted that throughout Reagan's 1984 presidential campaign, the invasion overshadowed the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings,[294] which killed 241 Americans taking part in an international peacekeeping operation during the Lebanese Civil War.[295] Reagan announced his reelection campaign on January 29, 1984, declaring, \"America is back and standing tall\".[228] In February, his administration reversed the unpopular decision to send the United States Marine Corps to Lebanon, thus eliminating a political liability for him. Reagan faced minimal opposition in the Republican primaries,[296] and he and Bush accepted the nomination at the Dallas convention in August.[297] In the general election, his campaign ran the commercial, \"Morning in America\".[298] At a time when the American economy was already recovering,[218] former vice president Walter Mondale[299] was attacked by Reagan's campaign as a \"tax-and-spend Democrat\", while Mondale criticized the deficit, the SDI, and Reagan's civil rights policy. However, Reagan's age induced his campaign managers to minimize his public appearances. Mondale's campaign believed that Reagan's age and mental health were issues before the October presidential debates.[300] Following Reagan's performance in the first debate where he struggled to recall statistics, his age was brought up by the media in negative fashion. Reagan's campaign changed his tactics for the second debate where he quipped, \"I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience\". This remark generated applause and laughter,[301] even from Mondale. At that point, Broder suggested that age was no longer a liability for Reagan,[302] and Mondale's campaign felt that \"the election was over\".[303] In November, Reagan won a landslide reelection victory with 59 percent of the popular vote and 525 electoral votes from 49 states. Mondale won 41 percent of the popular vote and 13 electoral votes from the District of Columbia and his home state of Minnesota.[304] The AIDS epidemic began to unfold in 1981,[305] and AIDS was initially difficult to understand for physicians and the public.[306] As the epidemic advanced, according to White House physician and later physician to the president, brigadier general John Hutton, Reagan thought of AIDS as though \"it was the measles and would go away\". The October 1985 death of the President's friend Rock Hudson affected Reagan's view; Reagan approached Hutton for more information on the disease. Still, between September 18, 1985, and February 4, 1986, Reagan did not mention AIDS in public.[307] In 1986, Reagan asked C. Everett Koop to develop a report on AIDS. Koop angered many evangelical conservatives, both in and out of the Reagan administration, by stressing the importance of sex education including condom usage in schools.[308] A year later, Reagan, who reportedly had not read the report,[309] gave his first speech on the epidemic when 36,058 Americans had been diagnosed with AIDS, and 20,849 had died of it.[310] Reagan called for increased testing (including routine testing for marriage applicants) and mandatory testing of select groups (including federal prisoners).[311] Even after this speech, however, Reagan remained reluctant to publicly address AIDS.[312] Scholars and AIDS activists have argued that the Reagan administration largely ignored the AIDS crisis.[313][314][315] Randy Shilts and Michael Bronski said that AIDS research was chronically underfunded during Reagan's administration, and Bronski added that requests for more funding by doctors at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were routinely denied.[316][317] In a September 1985 press conference (soon after Hollywood celebrity Rock Hudson had announced his AIDS diagnosis) Reagan called a government AIDS research program a \"top priority\", but also cited budgetary constraints.[318] Between the fiscal years of 1984 and 1989, federal spending on AIDS totaled $5.6 billion. The Reagan administration proposed $2.8 billion during this time period, but pressure from congressional Democrats resulted in the larger amount.[319] Popular opposition to apartheid increased during Reagan's first term in office and the disinvestment from South Africa movement achieved critical mass after decades of growing momentum. Criticism of apartheid was particularly strong on college campuses and among mainline Protestant denominations.[322][323] President Reagan was opposed to divestiture because he personally thought, as he wrote in a letter to Sammy Davis Jr., it \"would hurt the very people we are trying to help and would leave us no contact within South Africa to try and bring influence to bear on the government\". He also noted the fact that the \"American-owned industries there employ more than 80,000 blacks\" and that their employment practices were \"very different from the normal South African customs\".[324] The Reagan administration developed constructive engagement[325] with the South African government as a means of encouraging it to gradually move away from apartheid and to give up its nuclear weapons program.[326] It was part of a larger initiative designed to foster peaceful economic development and political change throughout southern Africa.[327] This policy, however, engendered much public criticism, and renewed calls for the imposition of stringent sanctions.[328] In response, Reagan announced the imposition of new sanctions on the South African government, including an arms embargo in late 1985.[329] These sanctions were seen as weak by anti-apartheid activists and as insufficient by the president's opponents in Congress.[328] In 1986, Congress approved the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act, which included tougher sanctions; Reagan's veto was overridden by Congress. Afterward, he remained opposed to apartheid and unsure of \"how best to oppose it\". Several European countries, as well as Japan, also imposed their sanctions on South Africa soon after.[330] Contentious relations between Libya and the United States under President Reagan were revived in the West Berlin discotheque bombing that killed an American soldier and injured dozens of others on April 5, 1986. Stating that there was irrefutable evidence that Libya had a direct role in the bombing, Reagan authorized the use of force against the country. On April 14, the United States launched a series of airstrikes on ground targets in Libya.[331] Thatcher allowed the United States Air Force to use Britain's air bases to launch the attack, on the justification that the United Kingdom was supporting America's right to self-defense under Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations.[332] The attack was, according to Reagan, designed to halt Muammar Gaddafi's \"ability to export terrorism\", offering him \"incentives and reasons to alter his criminal behavior\".[333] The attack was condemned by many countries; by an overwhelming vote, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution to condemn the attack and deem it a violation of the Charter and international law.[334] Reagan authorized William J. Casey to arm the Contras, fearing that Communists would take over Nicaragua if it remained under the leadership of the Sandinistas. Congress passed the 1982 Boland Amendment, prohibiting the CIA and Department of Defense from using their budgets to provide aid to the Contras. Still, the Reagan administration raised funds for the Contras from private donors and foreign governments.[335] When Congress learned that the CIA had secretly placed naval mines in Nicaraguan harbors, Congress passed a second Boland Amendment that barred granting any assistance to the Contras.[336] By mid-1985, Hezbollah began to take American hostages in Lebanon, holding seven of them in reaction to the United States' support of Israel.[337] Reagan procured the release of seven American hostages held by Hezbollah by selling American arms to Iran, then engaged in the Iran–Iraq War, in hopes that Iran would pressure Hezbollah to release the hostages.[338] The Reagan administration sold over 2,000 missiles to Iran without informing Congress; Hezbollah released four hostages but captured an additional six Americans. On Oliver North's initiative, the administration redirected the proceeds from the missile sales to the Contras.[338] The transactions were exposed by Ash-Shiraa in early November 1986. Reagan initially denied any wrongdoing, but on November 25, he announced that John Poindexter and North had left the administration and that he would form the Tower Commission to investigate the transactions. A few weeks later, Reagan asked a panel of federal judges to appoint a special prosecutor who would conduct a separate investigation.[339] The Tower Commission released a report in February 1987 confirming that the administration had traded arms for hostages and sent the proceeds of the weapons sales to the Contras. The report laid most of the blame on North, Poindexter, and Robert McFarlane, but it was also critical of Donald Regan and other White House staffers.[340] Investigators did not find conclusive proof that Reagan had known about the aid provided to the Contras, but the report noted that Reagan had \"created the conditions which made possible the crimes committed by others\" and had \"knowingly participated or acquiesced in covering up the scandal\".[341] The affair damaged the administration and raised questions about Reagan's competency and the wisdom of conservative policies.[342] The administration's credibility was also badly damaged on the international stage as it had violated its own arms embargo on Iran.[343] In the context of the Tanker War on May 17, 1987, an Iraqi fighter jet hit the USS Stark with two Exocet missiles, killing 37 sailors.[344][345] Three days later, President Reagan declared a \"policy of self-defense\" would now be ordered, as he accepted Iraq's official apology:[346] \"Our ships are deployed in the Persian Gulf in order to protect U.S. interests and maintain free access and maintain freedom of navigation and access to the area's oil supplies. It is a vital mission, but our ships need to protect themselves and they will. [From now on] if aircraft approach any of our ships in a way that appears hostile, there is one order of battle. Defend yourselves. Defend American lives.. We're going to do what has to be done to keep the Persian Gulf open. It's international waters. No country there has a right to try and close it off and take it for itself. And the villain in the piece really is Iran. And so they're delighted with what has just happened.\"[347] Although the Soviets did not accelerate military spending in response to Reagan's military buildup,[348] their enormous military expenses, in combination with collectivized agriculture and inefficient planned manufacturing, were a heavy burden for the Soviet economy. At the same time, the prices of oil, the primary source of Soviet export revenues, fell to one third of the previous level in 1985. These factors contributed to a stagnant economy during the tenure of Mikhail Gorbachev as Soviet leader.[349] Reagan's foreign policy towards the Soviets wavered between brinkmanship and cooperation.[350] Reagan appreciated Gorbachev's revolutionary change in the direction of the Soviet policy and shifted to diplomacy, intending to encourage him to pursue substantial arms agreements.[284] They held four summit conferences between 1985 and 1988.[351] Reagan believed that if he could persuade the Soviets to allow for more democracy and free speech, this would lead to reform and the end of communism.[352] The critical summit was in Reykjavík in 1986, where they agreed to abolish all nuclear weapons. However, Gorbachev added the condition that SDI research must be confined to laboratories during the ten-year period when disarmament would take place. Reagan refused, stating that it was defensive only and that he would share the secrets with the Soviets, thus failing to reach a deal.[353] In June 1987, Reagan addressed Gorbachev during a speech at the Berlin Wall, demanding that he \"tear down this wall\". The remark was ignored at the time, but after the wall fell in November 1989, it was retroactively recast as a soaring achievement.[354][355][356] In December, Reagan and Gorbachev met again at the Washington Summit[357] to sign the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, committing to the total abolition of their respective short-range and medium-range missile stockpiles.[358] The treaty established an inspections regime designed to ensure that both parties honored the agreement.[359] In May 1988, the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly voted in favor of ratifying the treaty,[360] providing a major boost to Reagan's popularity in the aftermath of the Iran–Contra affair. A new era of trade and openness between the two powers commenced, and the United States and Soviet Union cooperated on international issues such as the Iran–Iraq War.[361] Upon leaving the presidency on January 20, 1989, at the age of 77, Reagan became the oldest president at the end of his tenure. This distinction will eventually pass to incumbent president Joe Biden who is currently 82 years old.[362][363] In retirement, Ronald and Nancy Reagan lived at 668 St. Cloud Road in Bel Air, in addition to Rancho del Cielo in Santa Barbara.[364] He received multiple awards and honors[365] in addition to generous payments for speaking engagements. In 1989 he supported repealing the Twenty-second Amendment's presidential term limits. In 1991, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library opened. Reagan also addressed the 1992 Republican National Convention \"to inspire allegiance to the party regulars\",[366] and favored a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. Reagan publicly favored the Brady Bill, drawing criticism from gun control opponents.[367] In 1989, in his first public appearance after leaving office and shortly after the Stockton schoolyard shooting, he stated: \"I do not believe in taking away the right of the citizen to own guns for sporting, for hunting, and so forth, or for home defense. But I do believe that an AK-47, a machine gun, is not a sporting weapon or needed for the defense of the home\".[368][369] In March 1991, Reagan wrote an op-ed in the New York Times, titled \"Why I'm for the Brady Bill\".[370][371] In May 1994, Reagan, Gerald Ford, and Jimmy Carter sent a letter to House members, urging them to support the controversial Federal Assault Weapons Ban.[372] His final public speech occurred on February 3, 1994, during a tribute to him in Washington, D.C.; his last major public appearance was at the funeral of Richard Nixon on April 27, 1994.[366] In August 1994, Reagan was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, which he announced through a handwritten letter in November.[373] There was speculation over how long he had demonstrated symptoms of mental degeneration,[374] but lay observations that he suffered from Alzheimer's while still in office have been disputed by medical experts;[375][376][377] his doctors said that he first began exhibiting overt symptoms of the illness in late 1992[378] or 1993.[377] Over time, the disease destroyed Reagan's mental capacity. By 1997, he was reported to recognize few people other than his wife, though he continued to walk through parks and on beaches, play golf, and visit his office in nearby Century City.[377] Eventually, his family decided that he would live in quiet semi-isolation with his wife.[379] By the end of 2003, Reagan had lost his ability to speak and was mostly confined to his bed, no longer able to recognize family members.[380] Reagan died of pneumonia, complicated by Alzheimer's,[381] at his home in Los Angeles, on June 5, 2004.[382] President George W. Bush called Reagan's death \"a sad hour in the life of America\".[381] His public funeral was held in the Washington National Cathedral,[383] where eulogies were given by Margaret Thatcher, Brian Mulroney, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush.[384] Other world leaders attended including Mikhail Gorbachev and Lech Wałęsa.[385] Reagan was interred at his presidential library.[384] Similar to previous presidents, Reagan began his presidency with approval ratings greater than 50 percent,[386][387] peaking above 70 percent shortly after his attempted assassination,[388][389] before declining by the end of his first year.[390] Afterwards, his ratings fluctuated in the mid-30s and mid-40s in his second and third years,[390][391] which has been attributed to the 1981–1982 recession.[390] His approval ratings rebounded after the invasion of Grenada[392][393][394] and by mid-1984 his approval rating neared 60 percent.[395] In the first two years of his second term, his approval ratings were consistently above 60 percent[396] but declined during the Iran–Contra scandal,[397] before beginning to recover in mid-1987.[398] In the Gallup poll, Reagan finished his presidency with an approval rating of 63 percent, the third highest for a departing president in history, behind only Franklin D. Roosevelt and Bill Clinton, both of whom finished at 66 percent.[399][400] In 1990, a year after he left office, a Gallup survey found that 54 percent of Americans said they approved of the overall job Reagan did as president.[401] The number of Americans who approved of the Reagan administration declined to 48 percent in 1992[402] but rebounded two years later to 52 percent.[403] In recent years, favorability of Reagan's presidency reached its highest ever: 71 percent approval in 2006;[404] 74 percent in 2010;[405] 72 percent in 2018;[406] and 69 percent in 2023.[407] He is often found to be second-most popular president since World War II, with only John F. Kennedy having higher ratings.[404][407] Defunct Newspapers Journals TV channels Websites Other Economics Gun rights Identity politics Nativist Religion Watchdog groups Youth/student groups Miscellaneous Other In 2008, British historian M. J. Heale summarized that scholars had reached a broad consensus in which \"Reagan rehabilitated conservatism, turned the country to the right, practiced a 'pragmatic conservatism' that balanced ideology with the constraints of government, revived faith in the presidency and American self-respect, and contributed to critically ending the Cold War\",[408] which ended with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.[409] Many conservative and liberal scholars have agreed that Reagan has been the most influential president since Roosevelt, leaving his imprint on American politics, diplomacy, culture, and economics through his effective communication of his conservative agenda and pragmatic compromising.[410] During the initial years of Reagan's post-presidency, historical rankings placed his presidency in the twenties.[411] Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, his presidency was often placed in the top ten.[412][413] Many proponents, including his Cold War contemporaries,[414][415] believe that his defense policies, economic policies, military policies, and hard-line rhetoric against the Soviet Union and communism, together with his summits with Gorbachev, played a significant part in ending the Cold War.[416][284] Professor Jeffrey Knopf argues that while Reagan's practice of referring to the Soviet Union as \"evil\" probably made no difference to the Soviet leaders, it possibly gave encouragement to Eastern European citizens who opposed their communist regimes.[284] President Truman's policy of containment is also regarded as a force behind the fall of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan undermined the Soviet system itself.[417] Nevertheless, Melvyn P. Leffler called Reagan \"Gorbachev's minor, yet indispensable partner, setting the framework for the dramatic changes that neither anticipated happening anytime soon\".[418] Critics, for example Paul Krugman, note Reagan's tenure as having begun a period of increased income inequality, sometimes called the \"Great Divergence\". Krugman also views Reagan as having initiated the ideology of the current-day Republican Party, which he feels is led by \"radicals\" who seek to \"undo the twentieth century\" gains in income equality and unionization.[419] Others, such as Nixon's Secretary of Commerce Peter G. Peterson, also criticize what they feel was not just Reagan's fiscal irresponsibility, but also the ushering in of an era where tax cutting \"became the GOP's core platform\", with resulting deficits and GOP leaders (speciously in Peterson's opinion) arguing supply-side gains would enable the country to \"grow\" its way out of deficits.[420] Reagan was known for storytelling and humor,[421] which involved puns[422] and self-deprecation.[423] Reagan also often emphasized family values, despite being the first president to have been divorced.[424] He showed the ability to comfort Americans during the aftermath of the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.[425] Reagan's ability to talk about substantive issues with understandable terms and to focus on mainstream American concerns earned him the laudatory moniker the \"Great Communicator\".[426][421] He also earned the nickname \"Teflon President\" in that public perceptions of him were not substantially tarnished by the controversies that arose during his administration.[427][428] Reagan led a new conservative movement, altering the political dynamic of the United States.[429] Conservatism became the dominant ideology for Republicans, displacing the party's faction of liberals and moderates.[430] Men began voting more Republican, and women began voting more Democrat – a gender distinction that has persisted.[429] He was supported by young voters, an allegiance that shifted many of them to the party.[431] He attempted to appeal to Black voters in 1980,[432] but would receive the lowest Black vote for a Republican presidential candidate at the time.[433] Throughout Reagan's presidency, Republicans were unable to gain complete control of Congress.[434] The period of American history most dominated by Reagan and his policies (particularly on taxes, welfare, defense, the federal judiciary, and the Cold War) is known as the Reagan era, which suggests that the \"Reagan Revolution\" had a lasting impact on the United States in domestic and foreign policy. The George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton administrations are often treated as an extension of the era, as is the George W. Bush administration.[435] Since 1988, Republican presidential candidates have invoked Reagan's policies and beliefs.[436]",

Ronald Reagan, originally an American actor and politician, became the 40th President of the United States serving from 1981 to 1989. His term saw a restoration of prosperity at home, with the goal of achieving “peace through strength” abroad. At the end of his two terms in office, Ronald Reagan viewed with satisfaction the achievements of his innovative program known as the Reagan Revolution, which aimed to reinvigorate the American people and reduce their reliance upon Government. He felt he had fulfilled his campaign pledge of 1980 to restore “the great, confident roar of American progress and growth and optimism.” On February 6, 1911, Ronald Wilson Reagan was born to Nelle and John Reagan in Tampico, Illinois. He attended high school in nearby Dixon and then worked his way through Eureka College. There, he studied economics and sociology, played on the football team, and acted in school plays. Upon graduation, he became a radio sports announcer. A screen test in 1937 won him a contract in Hollywood. During the next two decades he appeared in 53 films. From his first marriage to actress Jane Wyman, he had two children, Maureen and Michael. Maureen passed away in 2001. In 1952 he married Nancy Davis, who was also an actress, and they had two children, Patricia Ann and Ronald Prescott. As president of the Screen Actors Guild, Reagan became embroiled in disputes over the issue of Communism in the film industry; his political views shifted from liberal to conservative. He toured the country as a television host, becoming a spokesman for conservatism. In 1966 he was elected Governor of California by a margin of a million votes; he was re-elected in 1970. Ronald Reagan won the Republican Presidential nomination in 1980 and chose as his running mate former Texas Congressman and United Nations Ambassador George Bush. Voters troubled by inflation and by the year-long confinement of Americans in Iran swept the Republican ticket into office. Reagan won 489 electoral votes to 49 for President Jimmy Carter. On January 20, 1981, Reagan took office. Only 69 days later he was shot by a would-be assassin, but quickly recovered and returned to duty. His grace and wit during the dangerous incident caused his popularity to soar. Dealing skillfully with Congress, Reagan obtained legislation to stimulate economic growth, curb inflation, increase employment, and strengthen national defense. He embarked upon a course of cutting taxes and Government expenditures, refusing to deviate from it when the strengthening of defense forces led to a large deficit. A renewal of national self-confidence by 1984 helped Reagan and Bush win a second term with an unprecedented number of electoral votes. Their victory turned away Democratic challengers Walter F. Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro. In 1986 Reagan obtained an overhaul of the income tax code, which eliminated many deductions and exempted millions of people with low incomes. At the end of his administration, the Nation was enjoying its longest recorded period of peacetime prosperity without recession or depression. In foreign policy, Reagan sought to achieve “peace through strength.” During his two terms he increased defense spending 35 percent, but sought to improve relations with the Soviet Union. In dramatic meetings with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, he negotiated a treaty that would eliminate intermediate-range nuclear missiles. Reagan declared war against international terrorism, sending American bombers against Libya after evidence came out that Libya was involved in an attack on American soldiers in a West Berlin nightclub. By ordering naval escorts in the Persian Gulf, he maintained the free flow of oil during the Iran-Iraq war. In keeping with the Reagan Doctrine, he gave support to anti-Communist insurgencies in Central America, Asia, and Africa. Overall, the Reagan years saw a restoration of prosperity, and the goal of peace through strength seemed to be within grasp. Learn more about Ronald Reagan’s spouse, Nancy Davis Reagan.

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Ronald Reagan was born on February 6, 1911, in Tampico, Illinois. Ronald Reagan died on June 5, 2004, in Los Angeles, California. Ronald Reagan attended Eureka College in Eureka, Illinois, where he played gridiron football and was active in the drama society but earned only passing grades. A popular student, he was elected class president in his senior year. Ronald Reagan rose to prominence initially as a film actor, appearing in more than 50 films, notably including Knute Rockne—All American (1940), Kings Row (1942), and The Hasty Heart (1950). Reagan later served as governor of California from 1967 to 1975, before being elected the 40th president of the United States in 1980. Ronald Reagan is largely credited with the demise of Soviet communism during the 1980s. As president, he worked to reduce the threat of war between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., to convince Soviet leaders that cooperation with the U.S. would serve Soviet interests, and to encourage openness and democracy in the U.S.S.R. An assessment of Ronald Reagan’s legacy as U.S. president should take into account his administration’s domestic policies and its record in foreign affairs, including the Iran-Contra Affair, among other factors. Brief summaries of Reagan’s accomplishments are available at ProCon.org. Ronald Reagan (born February 6, 1911, Tampico, Illinois, U.S.—died June 5, 2004, Los Angeles, California) was the 40th president of the United States (1981–89), noted for his conservative Republicanism, his fervent anticommunism, and his appealing personal style, characterized by a jaunty affability and folksy charm. The only movie actor ever to become president, he had a remarkable skill as an orator that earned him the title “the Great Communicator.” His policies have been credited with contributing to the demise of Soviet communism. Ronald Reagan was the second child of John Edward (“Jack”) Reagan, a struggling shoe salesman, and Nelle Wilson Reagan. Reagan’s nickname, “Dutch,” derived from his father’s habit of referring to his infant son as his “fat little Dutchman.” After several years of moving from town to town—made necessary in part because of Jack Reagan’s alcoholism, which made it difficult for him to hold a job—the family settled in Dixon, Illinois, in 1920. Despite their near poverty and his father’s drinking problem, Reagan later recalled his childhood in Dixon as the happiest period of his life. At Eureka College in Eureka, Illinois, Reagan played football and was active in the drama society but earned only passing grades. A popular student, he was elected class president in his senior year. Graduating in 1932 with a bachelor’s degree in economics and sociology, he decided to enter radio broadcasting. He landed a job as a sportscaster at station WOC in Davenport, Iowa, by delivering entirely from memory an exciting play-by-play description of a Eureka College football game. Later he moved to station WHO in Des Moines, where, as sportscaster “Dutch Reagan,” he became popular throughout the state for his broadcasts of Chicago Cubs baseball games. Because the station could not afford to send him to Wrigley Field in Chicago, Reagan was forced to improvise a running account of the games based on sketchy details delivered over a teletype machine. In 1937 Reagan followed the Cubs to their spring training camp in southern California, a trip he undertook partly in order to try his hand at movie acting. After a successful screen test at Warner Brothers, he was soon typecast in a series of mostly B movies as a sincere, wholesome, easygoing “good guy.” (As many observers have noted, the characters that Reagan portrayed in the movies were remarkably like Reagan himself.) During the next 27 years, he appeared in more than 50 films, notably including Knute Rockne—All American (1940), Kings Row (1942), and The Hasty Heart (1950). In 1938, while filming Brother Rat, Reagan became engaged to his costar Jane Wyman, and the couple married in Hollywood two years later. They had a daughter, Maureen, in 1941 and adopted a son, Michael, a few days after his birth in 1945. Their marriage ended in divorce in 1948. Reagan was the first president to have been divorced. Commissioned a cavalry officer at the outbreak of World War II, Reagan was assigned to an army film unit based in Los Angeles, where he spent the rest of the war making training films. Although he never left the country and never saw combat, he and Wyman cooperated with the efforts of Warner Brothers to portray him as a real soldier to the public, and in newsreels and magazine photos he acted out scenes of “going off to war” and “coming home on leave.” After leaving Hollywood, Reagan became known for occasionally telling stories about his past—including stories about his happiness at “coming back from the war”—that were actually based on fictional episodes in movies. Some of Reagan’s detractors pointed to such lapses to suggest that he lacked a basic interest in the truth and that he had trouble distinguishing between reality and fantasy. Reagan had absorbed the liberal Democratic opinions of his father and became a great admirer of Franklin Roosevelt after his election in 1932. Reagan’s father eventually found work as an administrator in a New Deal office established in the Dixon area, a fact that Reagan continued to appreciate even after his political opinion of Roosevelt had dramatically changed. From 1947 to 1952 Reagan served as president of the union of movie actors, the Screen Actors Guild. He fought against communist infiltration in the guild, crossing picket lines to break the sometimes violent strikes. (Such violence and chaos were abhorrent to Reagan, and, when police and students clashed in Berkeley in May 1969, Reagan, as governor of California, called out the National Guard to restore order.) Much to the disgust of union members, he testified as a friendly witness before the House Un-American Activities Committee and cooperated in the blacklisting of actors, directors, and writers suspected of leftist sympathies. Although Reagan was still a Democrat at the time (he campaigned for Harry Truman in the presidential election of 1948), his political opinions were gradually growing more conservative. After initially supporting Democratic senatorial candidate Helen Douglas in 1950, he switched his allegiance to Republican Richard Nixon midway through the campaign. He supported Republican Dwight Eisenhower in the presidential elections of 1952 and 1956, and in 1960 he delivered 200 speeches in support of Nixon’s campaign for president against Democrat John F. Kennedy. He officially changed his party affiliation to Republican in 1962. Reagan met Nancy Davis (Nancy Reagan), a relatively unknown actress, at a dinner party in 1949, and the two were married in a simple ceremony in 1952, at which actor William Holden was best man. The Reagans appeared together in the war movie Hell Cats of the Navy in 1957. Nancy Reagan’s conservative political views encouraged her husband’s drift to the right. After his acting career began to decline in the 1950s, Reagan became the host of a television drama series, General Electric Theater, as well as spokesman for the General Electric Company. In the latter capacity he toured GE plants around the country, delivering inspirational speeches with a generally conservative, pro-business message. Eventually, however, his speeches became too controversial for the company’s taste, and he was fired as both spokesman and television host in 1962.",

Before becoming president, he was the 33rd governor of California from 1967 to 1975. He was also the 9th and 13th president of the Screen Actors Guild from 1947 to 1952 and again from 1959 until 1960. Reagan got a degree from Eureka College in 1932 and became a sports broadcaster in Iowa. In 1937, Reagan moved to California, where he became a movie actor. From 1947 to 1952, Reagan was the president of the Screen Actors Guild. In the 1950s, he worked in television and spoke for General Electric. From 1959 to 1960, he again was the Screen Actors Guild's president. In 1964, \"A Time for Choosing\" gave Reagan attention as a new conservative figure. He was elected governor of California in 1966. During his time as governor, he raised taxes, fixed the state's budget, and ended student protests in Berkeley. After running against and losing to president Gerald Ford in the 1976 Republican presidential primaries, Reagan won the Republican nomination and then a landslide victory over Democratic president Jimmy Carter in the 1980 United States presidential election. In his first term, Reagan created \"Reaganomics\", which included economic deregulation and cuts in both taxes and government spending during a time of stagflation. He grew an arms race and had a more intense response with the Soviet Union. He also survived an assassination attempt, had a problems with public sector labor unions, made the war on drugs bigger, and ordered the invasion of Grenada in 1983. In the 1984 presidential election, Reagan was re-elected over former vice president Walter Mondale in another landslide victory. Foreign policy took over Reagan's second term, including the 1986 bombing of Libya, the Iran–Iraq War, the secret sale of arms to Iran to fund the Contras, and a more calm response in talks with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that led to the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. Reagan left the presidency in 1989 with a lower unemployment rate than when he took office and lowered the country's inflation, however the national deficit grew.[1][2] He also had the government spend more money for the military and lowered taxes.[1] Being diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 1994, it made Reagan's post-presidency difficult and his physical and mental health quickly got worse. He died in June 2004 at the age of 93. His presidency is a part of the Reagan era, and he is thought to be an important conservative figure in the United States.[3] Historians and scholars have ranked Reagan among the upper tier of American presidents, however he remains unpopular by some critics because of his domestic and tax policies.[4][5] Reagan was born to Jack and Nelle Reagan on February 6, 1911, in a small apartment building in Tampico, Illinois.[6][7][8] He had an older brother named Neil.[9] His father was a Roman Catholic of Irish descent.[10] His mother was a Protestant of English and Scottish descent.[11] The family moved to different places in Illinois when Reagan was a child. They moved to Monmouth and Galesburg.[12] His family finally moved to Dixon, Illinois.[7] They lived in a small house in Dixon.[13] His family was very poor and Reagan did not have much as a child.[11] In high school, Reagan enjoyed acting.[14] Reagan was athletic as well and played for the school's football team.[15] He became a lifeguard and saved 77 lives.[16] Reagan studied at Eureka College in Illinois.[8] Between 1930 and 1931, during his college years, Reagan played football with the college team.[17] During this time, two Black teammates were not allowed to stay at a segregated hotel.[17] Reagan invited them to his parents' home nearby in Dixon.[17] He graduated in 1932.[8][18] After college, Reagan became a sports announcer at news radio station WHO.[8][19] Reagan was also a broadcaster for the Chicago Cubs.[19][20] He was good at retelling baseball games.[20] In 1936, Reagan went with the Cubs to practice baseball at Santa Catalina Island in California.[21] While he was in California, Reagan got a seven-year contract with Warner Brothers.[22][23] He left his job as a radio announcer to start acting.[22][24] Ronald Reagan was in fifty-three movies.[8] His first screen credit was the starring role in the 1937 movie Love Is on the Air. He then starred in many movies such as Dark Victory with Bette Davis and Humphrey Bogart.[25] Before the movie Santa Fe Trail with Errol Flynn in 1940, he played the role of George \"The Gipper\" Gipp in the movie Knute Rockne, All American.[25] From his role in the movie, he got the lifelong nickname \"the Gipper\".[25] In 1941, experts voted him the fifth most popular star from the younger generation in Hollywood.[26] Reagan's favorite acting role was as a double amputee in 1942's Kings Row.[27] In the movie, he says the line, \"Where's the rest of me?\" It was later used as the title of his 1965 autobiography. Many movie critics thought Kings Row to be his best movie.[28] Even though the movie was popular, it received bad reviews by New York Times critic Bosley Crowther.[29] Although Reagan called Kings Row the movie that \"made me a star\",[30] he was unable to keep up with his success. This was because he was ordered to active duty with the U.S. Army in San Francisco two months after the movie's release.[31] During World War II, Reagan was separated for four years from his movie career.[32] He served in the First Motion Picture Unit.[32] After the war, Reagan co-starred in movies such as The Voice of the Turtle, John Loves Mary, The Hasty Heart, Bedtime for Bonzo, Cattle Queen of Montana, Juke Girl, This Is the Army, The Winning Team, Tennessee's Partner, and Hellcats of the Navy, in which he worked with his wife, Nancy. Reagan's last movie was a 1964 movie The Killers.[33][34] Throughout his movie career, his mother, Nelle, wrote most of the responses to Reagan's fan mail.[35] Reagan was also a spokesperson. He hosted the General Electric Theater since it was first shown in 1953.[36] He was fired in 1962.[36] In 1957, Reagan won a Hollywood Citizenship Award, which was a special Golden Globe Award.[37] Reagan was first elected to the board of directors of the Screen Actors Guild in 1941.[38] After World War II, he quickly returned to Screen Actors Guild.[38] Reagan became the 3rd vice-president of the Screen Actors Guild in 1946.[38] Reagan was nominated in a special election to become president of the Screen Actors Guild.[38] Reagan was elected in 1947. Reagan was president of the Screens Actors Guild from 1947 to 1952.[38] Reagan was re-elected president in 1959. He served only a year before resigning in 1960.[38] Reagan led the Screen Actors Guild during labor disputes, the Taft–Hartley Act, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) hearings and the Hollywood blacklist era.[38] During the late 1940s, Reagan and his then-wife Jane Wyman gave the FBI names of actors whom they believed were communists.[39] Reagan even spoke at a special meeting at Congress on communism in Hollywood as well.[40] Although Reagan gave out names of actors who were suspected communists, he did not agree with the way people were using these names. Reagan said \"Do they expect us to constitute ourselves as a little FBI of our own and determine just who is a Commie and who isn't?\"[39] Reagan met Jane Wyman while making Brother Rat in 1938.[41] He asked Wyman to marry him at the Chicago Theatre.[42] They were married in January 1940.[41] They had two children: Michael (adopted) and Maureen Reagan.[43] They had a third child, Christine Reagan, but she was stillborn.[43] With Reagan's growing political career and the death of their child, Wyman filed for divorce in 1948. The divorce was final in 1949.[8][43] Reagan was the first United States President to be divorced.[44] In 1949, months after divorcing Wyman, Reagan met Nancy Davis.[45] Davis was an actress who was accidentally listed as a communist and asked Reagan to help.[46] After Reagan helped Davis, the two began dating.[46] Three years later, Reagan asked Davis to marry him in Beverly Hills, California while Nancy was two months pregnant.[47] They were married on March 4, 1952, in Hollywood, California.[8][46] Together, they had two children: Ron and Patti Reagan.[45] Nancy and Reagan were married for 54 years until Reagan died in 2004.[8] Wyman died of natural causes on September 10, 2010.[43] She was aged 90.[43] Nancy died on March 6, 2016 of heart failure.[48] She was aged 94.[48] Reagan was very active in politics near the end of his acting career. Reagan used to be a Democrat.[49] He strongly supported the New Deal. He admired Franklin D. Roosevelt.[50] Over time, Reagan became a conservative Republican. This was because he thought the federal government had too much power and authority. He made a famous speech against socialized medicine (government-run health care).[51] Reagan supported Dwight D. Eisenhower and Richard Nixon for the United States presidency.[52] The last time Reagan supported a Democrat was when Helen Gahagan Douglas ran for the United States Senate.[53] During the 1964 presidential election, Reagan supported Republican candidate Barry Goldwater.[54] He made a famous speech called \"A Time for Choosing\" to support Goldwater.[54] In the speech he spoke against government programs and high taxes. Even though Goldwater did not win the election, Reagan gained popularity from it.[6] In his speech, Reagan said \"You and I have a rendezvous with destiny. We will preserve for our children this, the last best hope of man on earth, or we will sentence them to take the first step into a thousand years of darkness\".[55] After Reagan gave this speech, many business people thought that Reagan could run for Governor of California.[56] After giving a speech for Barry Goldwater's presidential campaign in 1964, he was persuaded to run for governor. Reagan ran as a Republican against the then governor, Pat Brown during the 1966 gubernatorial election.[57] Reagan won the election with 3,742,913 (57.55%) of the vote while Brown won 2,749,174 (42.27%) of the vote.[58] Reagan was inaugurated on January 2, 1967.[56] During his years as Governor, Reagan stopped hiring government workers. He did this to slow the growth of California's workforce. Reagan also approved tax increases to balance the state budget.[56] Reagan worked with the Democratic Party majority in the state legislature to help create a major reform of the welfare system in 1971.[59] The reform helped give money to the poor and increase the pay of the rich.[59] During his term as governor, Reagan served as the President of the Republican Governors Association from 1968 to 1969.[60] In 1967, Reagan signed an act that did not allow the public carrying loaded guns.[61] In 1968, a petition to force Reagan into a recall election failed.[62] Reagan ran briefly for president in 1968.[63] He was not nominated by the Republican Party at the 1968 Republican National Convention as Richard Nixon was nominated.[64] On May 15, 1969, during the People's Park protests at the University of California, Berkeley, Reagan sent the California Highway Patrol and other officers to fight off the protests, in an event that became known as \"Bloody Thursday\".[65] Reagan then called out 2,200 state National Guard troops to occupy the city of Berkeley for two weeks to crack down on the protesters.[66] Reagan ran for re-election in the 1970 gubernatorial election against assemblyman Jesse M. Unruh.[67] Reagan won 3,439,174 (52.83%) of the vote while Unruh won 2,938,607 (45.14%) of the vote.[68] During his final term as governor, he played a major role in California's educational system.[56] He raised student loans. This caused a massive protest between Reagan and the college students.[56] Reagan would soon be criticized of his views of the educational system.[56] Reagan left office on January 6, 1975, when Jerry Brown, Pat Brown's son, succeeded Reagan as governor.[56] In 1976, Reagan said he would run against President Gerald Ford to become the Republican Party's candidate for president.[69] Reagan soon became the conservative candidate with the support of groups such as the American Conservative Union, which became important supporters of his political run, while Ford was seen as a more moderate Republican.[70] During his 1976 campaign, Reagan controversially used the pejorative phrase \"welfare queen\" to talk about Linda Taylor who illegally misused her welfare benefits in 1974.[71] He used Taylor and her criminal activities to defend why he was against social programs in the United States.[72] Reagan picked United States Senator Richard Schweiker of Pennsylvania as his running mate.[73] Reagan won a few primaries early such as North Carolina, Texas and California, but soon failed to win key primaries such as New Hampshire, Florida, and his native Illinois.[74][75] During the 1976 GOP convention, Ford won the nomination with 1,187 delegates to Reagan's 1,070.[74] Ford would go on to lose the 1976 presidential election to the Democratic nominee, Jimmy Carter.[70] Though he lost the nomination, Reagan got 307 write-in votes in New Hampshire, 388 votes as an Independent on Wyoming's ballot, and a single electoral vote from general election from the state of Washington.[76] In November 1979, Reagan announced his plans to run for president again in the 1980 presidential election against President Jimmy Carter.[77] His campaign slogan, \"Make America Great Again\", was heavily used in the 1980 election and in Reagan's 1984 re-election campaign.[78] The slogan would be used by Presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump in their presidential campaigns.[79][80] Reagan also used the slogan \"Morning in America\" in this campaign.[81] Reagan had many people running for the nomination such as former Director George H. W. Bush, United States representatives John B. Anderson and Phil Crane, United States senators Bob Dole, Howard Baker, Larry Pressler and Lowell P. Weicker, Jr., Governor Harold Stassen, former Treasury Secretary John Connally and Republican businessman Ben Fernandez.[82] In May 1980, Reagan won enough delegates to win the Republican Party nomination.[83] At the 1980 Republican National Convention, Reagan named Bush as his running mate.[84] Reagan's presidential campaign focused on lowering taxes to grow the economy,[85] less government in people's lives,[86] states' rights,[87] and a strong national defense.[88] His relaxed and confident appearance during the Reagan-Carter debate on TV on October 28, made him more popular. He increased his lead over Carter in opinion polls.[89] On November 4, Reagan won the election. He won 44 states with 489 electoral votes. Carter won 6 states and the District of Columbia with 49 electoral votes.[90] He also won the popular vote with 50.7% to Carter's 41.0%. Independent John B. Anderson won 6.6%.[89][90] Reagan was first sworn in as president on January 20, 1981.[91] In his inaugural address, he talked about the country's economic problems, saying \"In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problems; government is the problem.\"[92] On the same day, hostages from the Iran hostage crisis were released.[91] During the first two years of his presidency Reagan worked with a conservative majority in Congress. It was estimated that there were 230 votes in the 97th Congress. However, this changed following the midterm elections in 1982, with liberals regaining control of the House of Representatives. In the 98th Congress, there were now only 190 conservatives in the House. [93] Reagan was nearly killed in an assassination attempt that happened on Monday, March 30, 1981.[94][95] 69 days after becoming president, he was leaving after a speaking engagement at the Washington Hilton Hotel in Washington, D.C.[95] He was shot by John Hinckley Jr.[95] Hinckley shot six bullets.[95] White House Press Secretary James Brady was shot in the head.[95] Brady later recovered, but was paralyzed.[96] Another bullet hit officer Thomas Delahanty in the back of the neck, but he survived.[97][98] The third bullet hit Secret Service agent Timothy McCarthy in the chest. McCarthy got shot so another bullet did not hit Reagan.[99] Reagan, Brady, Delahanty and McCarthy were the only ones injured during the event and they all survived.[95][94] Reagan was taken to the George Washington University Hospital, which was the nearest hospital to the hotel and White House.[95] He suffered a punctured lung and a broken rib bone.[95] He lost about 3/4 of his blood.[95] Reagan soon made a fast recovery after doctors performed surgery.[95] It was later said that the bullet was one inch away from his heart.[95] In 1981, Reagan became the first president to propose a constitutional amendment on school prayer.[100] In 1985, Reagan expressed his disappointment that the Supreme Court ruling still bans a moment of silence for public schools, and said he had \"an uphill battle.\"[101] In 1987, Reagan once again wanted Congress to support prayer in schools and end \"the expulsion of God from America's classrooms.\"[102] People who did not support this, with some thinking it was going against the first amendment.[103] Reagan's Attorney General, William French Smith, thought it was unconstitutional.[103] In the summer of 1981, the union of federal air traffic controllers went on strike. They broke a federal law that does not allow government unions to strike.[104] Reagan said that if the air traffic controllers \"do not report for work within 48 hours, they have forfeited their jobs and will be terminated\".[105] They did not return and on August 5, Reagan fired 11,359 striking air traffic controllers who had ignored his order, and used supervisors and military controllers to handle the nation's commercial air traffic until new controllers could be hired and trained.[106] The Reagan administration did not pay attention to the AIDS crisis in the United States in 1981.[107] AIDS research did not have the proper money needed during Reagan's administration. There were requests for more funding by doctors at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), but they were ignored. By the end of the first 12 months of the epidemic, more than 1,000 people had died of AIDS in the United States.[107][108] By the time President Reagan gave his first speech on the epidemic in 1987, 36,058 Americans had been diagnosed with AIDS and 20,849 had died of it.[109] By the end of 1989, the year Reagan left office, 115,786 people had been diagnosed with AIDS in the United States, and more than 70,000 of them had died of it.[107] During his presidency, he also stopped giving out money that was given by the World Health Organization.[110] In 1988, before speaking to the United Nations, Reagan decided to give out the WHO funds.[110] Reagan originally did not support making Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday a national holiday, because of cost concerns.[111][112] But on November 2, 1983, Reagan signed a bill to create a federal holiday honoring King.[113] The bill had passed the Senate by a count of 78 to 22[114] and the House of Representatives by 338 to 90.[115] The holiday was observed for the first time on January 20, 1986.[116] It is observed on the third Monday of January.[116] Reagan believed that the government should be small, not big. This means that the government should not interfere in people's lives very much or interfere with what businesses do.[8] He believed in supply-side economics, which was also called Reaganomics and Voodoo economics by people who did not like it during his term.[117] He lowered everybody's income taxes by 25%[118] and cut government spending.[119] While he was president, inflation went from 13.5% to 4.1%.[2] Reagan's economic plan caused a bad economy during 1982, but the economy recovered in 1983.[120][121] However, people who did not like his economic plan pointed out an increase in the national debt from 31% to 50.8% of the country's GDP.[122] During his time in office, unemployment fell from 7.6% to 5.5% and the economy grew by 40%.[2] Reagan gave his \"Evil empire\" speech to the National Association of Evangelicals in Orlando, Florida on March 8, 1983.[123] He spoke about the nuclear arms race and said how communism would eventually fail.[123][124] Reagan said \"In your discussions of the nuclear freeze proposals, I urge you to beware the temptation of pride, the temptation of blithely declaring yourselves above it all and label both sides equally at fault, to ignore the facts of history and the aggressive impulses of an evil empire, to simply call the arms race a giant misunderstanding and thereby remove yourself from the struggle between right and wrong and good and evil.\"[125] In the \"Evil Empire\" speech, Reagan also said how he wanted NATO to use nuclear-armed intermediate-range ballistic missiles in Western Europe as a response to the Soviets adding new nuclear-armed missiles in Eastern Europe.[124] In 1983, Reagan sent forces to Lebanon to stop the threat of the Lebanese Civil War.[126] On October 23, 1983, American forces in Beirut were attacked.[127] The Beirut barracks bombing killed 241 Americans and hurt more than 60 others by a suicide truck bomber.[128][127] Reagan removed all the Marines from Lebanon.[129] Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, who had told the administration against having U.S. Marines in Lebanon, said there would be no change in the U.S.'s Lebanon policy.[130] Reagan met with his national security team and planned to target the Sheik Abdullah barracks in Baalbek, Lebanon.[131] A joint American–French air assault on the camp where the bombing was planned was also approved by Reagan and French President François Mitterrand, however U.S. Defense Secretary Weinberger successfully told Reagan to go against the mission.[132] In September 1983, Korean Air Lines Flight 007 was shot down by the Soviet Union.[133] It killed one politician and many more Americans. Reagan was angry at the Soviets.[133] Reagan addressed the nation.[133] As a result, Reagan proposed that the American military's GPS would be allowed for civilian use.[134] In his address, Reagan said \"I'm coming before you tonight about the Korean airline massacre, the attack by the Soviet Union against 269 innocent men, women, and children aboard an unarmed Korean passenger plane. This crime against humanity must never be forgotten, here or throughout the world.\"[135] On October 25, 1983, Reagan ordered U.S. forces to invade Grenada, code named Operation Urgent Fury. Reagan said that there was a \"regional threat posed by a Soviet-Cuban military build-up in the Caribbean\" in Grenada.[136] Operation Urgent Fury was the first major military operation done by U.S. forces since the Vietnam War. Some days of fighting started, but it resulted in a U.S. victory.[136] In mid-December, U.S. forces withdrew from Grenada after a new form of government was created there.[136] Reagan was once again nominated for president at the 1984 Republican National Convention.[137] His Democratic opponent was former Vice President Walter Mondale of Minnesota.[138] During the first presidential debate, many said Reagan lost the debate and there were rumors about Reagan's health citing his confusion on stage.[139] Many thought Reagan was showing the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.[140] In the second debate, Reagan improved his performance and when asked about questions of his age, he said \"I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.\"[141] Reagan's statement made the entire audience laugh including the moderators and Mondale himself.[141] Reagan also repeated his 1980 debate phrase: \"There you go again\".[141] Reagan was re-elected in 1984 in a landslide victory. Reagan won 49 out of the 50 states.[138] He carried more electoral votes than any other president in American history.[138] Reagan was sworn in as president once again on January 20, 1985. He was sworn in at the White House due to cold weather.[138] In the weeks after, he changed his staff by moving White House Chief of Staff James Baker to Secretary of the Treasury and naming Treasury Secretary Donald Regan to Chief of Staff.[142] Reagan became friends with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Margaret Thatcher.[138] Both of them held meetings about the Soviet Union's threat and how to end the Cold War. Reagan became the first American president to ever address the British Parliament.[143] In foreign policy, Reagan ended détente (the policy of being friendly to the Soviet Union) by ordering the largest peacetime military buildup in American history.[144][145] The U.S. government had to borrow a lot of money to pay for it. He had many new weapons built. Soon, the U.S. began to research a missile defense system that would destroy missiles. It was to prevent a nuclear war from happening.[146] The program was called Strategic Defense Initiative. It was nicknamed \"Star Wars\".[146] He directed money to anti-communist movements all over the world that wanted to overthrow their communist government. He ordered multiple military operations including the invasion of Grenada and the Libya bombing.[8][147] In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev became the new leader of the Soviet Union (which was in bad shape and soon to collapse). Reagan had many talks with him. Their first meeting together was at the Reykjavík Summit in Iceland.[148] They became good friends.[149][150] In May 1985, Reagan and Chancellor Helmut Kohl were scheduled to visit a military cemetery in Bitburg, Germany to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the end of World War II.[151] The visit caused controversy as the cemetery had members of the Waffen-SS buried there and Reagan did not schedule a visit to a concentration camp.[151] As a result, a trip to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp was added to Reagan's schedule where he made a few remarks about the Holocaust and the end of the war.[151] Reagan responded by saying \"This visit has stirred many emotions in the American and German people too. Some old wounds have been reopened, and this I regret very much, because this should be a time of healing.\"[152] During the Reagan presidency, relations between Libya and the United States were not good. In early April 1986, relations became worse when a bomb exploded in a Berlin discothèque.[153] It resulted in the injury of 63 American military personnel and the death of one serviceman.[153] On April 15, 1986, the United States launched many attacks in Libya.[154][155] British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher allowed the U.S. Air Force to use Britain's air bases to launch the attack.[155] The attack was done to stop Gaddafi's \"ability to export terrorism\", offering him \"incentives and reasons to alter his criminal behavior\".[154] The president addressed the nation from the Oval Office after the attacks started. He said \"When our citizens are attacked or abused anywhere in the world on the direct orders of hostile regimes, we will respond so long as I'm in this office\".[155] Many countries and the United Nations did not like Reagan's decision to bomb Libya.[156] The United Nations said that Reagan broke \"the Charter of the United Nations and of international law\".[156] In the 1980s, apartheid in South Africa was becoming more violent and a global issue.[157] The Democrats in the Senate tried to pass the Anti-Apartheid Act in September 1985, but could not pass because of a Republican filibuster.[158] Reagan created his own sanctions for South Africa, but Democrats thought they were weak.[159] The bill was re-introduced in 1986 and brought up for a vote even though Republican wanted to block it to give Reagan's sanctions time to work.[160] It passed the House with Reagan publicly against it.[161] Later the Senate approved the bill with a 84-14 vote.[162] On September 26, 1986, Reagan vetoed the bill saying that it would cause an \"economic war\".[163] Republican Senator Richard Lugar led the Senate to override Reagan's veto.[164] The veto was reversed by Congress (by the Senate 78 to 21, the House by 313 to 83) on October 2.[165] The veto override was the first one on a presidential foreign policy veto in the 20th century.[163] In response to the veto override, Reagan said \"I believe, are not the best course of action; they hurt the very people they are intended to help. My hope is that these punitive sanctions do not lead to more violence and more repression. Our administration will, nevertheless, implement the law\".[166] Reagan also criticized those who were against apartheid such as the African National Congress (ANC).[157] He thought the ANC was dangerous and supported communism.[157] On a trip to the United States after winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984, Bishop Desmond Tutu said that Reagan's policy was \"immoral, evil and totally un-Christian.\"[157] Reagan's popularity was badly hurt by the political scandal Iran-Contra Affair.[8][167] The government illegally sold weapons to Iran.[167] It later used the profits to support a Nicaraguan terrorist group called the Contras.[167] Reagan told the American people he did not know anything about the scandal.[167] Reagan gave money to the Contras to fight off the Communist rule of Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua, but when it became too expensive, Congress made it illegal to pay the Contras.[167] As a result, members of Reagan's administration began to send money illegally to the Contras.[167] The New York Times said that Reagan's 1980 campaign made a deal with Iran in which they would release American hostages after Jimmy Carter left office.[168] His United States National Security Advisor John Poindexter was charged with multiple felonies and later resigned.[169] Reagan later nominated former Ambassador Frank Carlucci to replace Poindexter.[170] His Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger was thought to be guilty, but resigned before a trial could begin.[171] Reagan later nominated Carlucci to be his Defense Secretary.[170] Oliver North, a member of the United States National Security Council, resigned and was questioned for his role in the affair.[172] In February 1987, White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan also resigned because of personal problems he had with Reagan and First Lady Reagan about his handling of the affair.[173] Soon, he told the American people that it was his fault. In his apology, Reagan said \"Let's start with the part that is the most controversial. A few months ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best intentions still tell me that's true, but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not.\"[174] In the end, fourteen administration officials were indicted and eleven convictions resulted.[174] The rest of those indicted or convicted were all pardoned by President George H. W. Bush, who had been Vice President at the time of the affair.[175] In 1987, Reagan traveled to Berlin to give a speech at the Berlin Wall.[176] That is where he gave one of his well known speeches of his presidency.[176] Former West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he would never forget standing near Reagan when he told Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall. \"He was a stroke of luck for the world, especially for Europe.\"[177] Talking about the Brandenburg Gate and the Berlin Wall he said that Gorbachev should support liberalization and that by tearing down the Berlin Wall it would bring freedom and peace to Germany.[178] During his term as president, Reagan saw the change in the mood of the Soviet leadership with Mikhail Gorbachev.[179] Months after his Berlin Wall speech, Gorbachev said his plans to work with Reagan for a big arms agreement.[180] Reagan and Gorbachev signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty which banned nuclear weapons being launched between the United States and the Soviet Union.[181] When Reagan visited Moscow for the fourth summit in 1988, he was seen as a celebrity by the Soviets.[182] A journalist asked the president if he still thought the Soviet Union the evil empire. \"No\", he replied, \"I was talking about another time, another era\".[182] In November 1989, ten months after Reagan left office, the Berlin Wall was torn down, the Cold War was officially declared over at the Malta Summit on December 3, 1989, and two years later, the Soviet Union collapsed.[183] Reagan announced a War on Drugs in 1982, because he was worried about the growing number of people using crack.[184] Even though Richard Nixon declared a war on drugs during the 1970s, Reagan used more militant policies.[185] First Lady Nancy Reagan created her \"Just Say No\" campaign against drug use to children.[186] In late 1984, Reagan visited Temple Hillel and became the first sitting president since George Washington to visit a synagogue.[187][188] In 1986, Reagan signed a drug enforcement bill that made sure there would be $1.7 billion to fund the War on Drugs. It created a mandatory minimum penalty for drug offenses.[189] The bill was criticized for creating racial inequalities and mass imprisonment of African-Americans.[189] As a result of Reagan's war on drugs, drug abuse became a growing problem among Americans at the time.[190] In 1986, the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded, killing everyone on board. The entire country was shocked. Reagan moved that date to his 1986 State of the Union Address because the tragedy.[191] It was the first time that a President of the United States postponed a State of the Union Address.[191] Afterwards, Reagan addressed the nation,[192] where he said \"We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and 'slipped the surly bonds of Earth' to 'touch the face of God'.\"[193] Reagan ordered for a commission to be created to investigate the explosion.[194] When the commission created a list of recommendations to avoid another explosion, Reagan ordered NASA to start using the new safety measures within thirty days.[195][196] In November 1986, Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act.[197] It helped some immigrants to get jobs and become legal citizens.[197] In that same year, the Statue of Liberty was just re-opened after being renovated. Reagan was at the opening ceremony when he said \"The legalization provisions in this act will go far to improve the lives of a class of individuals who now must hide in the shadows, without access to many of the benefits of a free and open society. Very soon many of these men and women will be able to step into the sunlight and, ultimately, if they choose, they may become Americans.\"[198] In January 1987, U.S. Representative Tom Foley introduced the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 to Congress as a way to give reparation to Japanese-Americans who were interned by the United States during World War II.[199] It passed the House in September 1987 and was sent to the Senate where it was passed in April 1988.[200] Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act into law on August 10, 1988, granting USD $20,000 in payments beginning in 1990.[199][200] A total of 82,219 Japanese-Americans received checks.[201] During his 1980 campaign, Reagan promised that, if elected, he would nominate the first female Supreme Court Associate Justice.[202] On July 7, 1981, he nominated Sandra Day O'Connor to replace the retiring Justice Potter Stewart.[203] Reagan said that O'Connor \"[was] truly a person for all qualities\".[204] O'Connor was confirmed by the United States Senate with a vote of 99–0.[203] In his second term in 1986, Reagan nominated William Rehnquist to replace Warren E. Burger as Chief Justice.[205] He named Antonin Scalia to fill the empty seat left by Rehnquist.[205] After Associate Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. announced his retirement in June 1987, Reagan picked conservative jurist Robert Bork to replace him in 1987.[206] Senator Ted Kennedy was strongly against Bork.[206] Kennedy said Bork was not strong on states', civil or women's rights.[206] Kennedy said that \"Robert Bork's America is a land where women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, police could break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists could be censored at the whim of the Government, and the doors of the Federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of citizens for whom the judiciary is—and is often the only—protector of the individual rights that are the heart of our democracy\".[207] Bork's nomination was not approved by the United States Senate with a vote of 58–42.[208] Reagan then nominated Douglas H. Ginsburg, but Ginsburg ended up not wanting the role as it was revealed he used cannabis.[209] Reagan later nominated Anthony Kennedy to replace Powell, Jr. and he was approved with a vote of 97–0.[210] Reagan left office with high rankings on January 20, 1989, when his Vice President George H. W. Bush became president.[8] Reagan was the oldest president at that time until former President Donald Trump was elected in 2024 at the age of 78.[211] Reagan and his wife, Nancy, soon returned home in Bel Air, Los Angeles, California.[212][6] They also visited their ranch, Rancho del Cielo. Reagan gave a speech at the 1992 Republican National Convention giving his support for Bush's re-election campaign in the 1992 presidential election.[213] Even after when he left office, Reagan had a close friendship with both Thatcher and Gorbachev.[138] In November 1991, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library was dedicated and opened to the public in Simi Valley, California.[214] In June 1989, Reagan was honored with Honorary Knighthood and received the Order of the Bath presented by Queen Elizabeth II.[215] He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1993 by President George H. W. Bush.[216] He was the first former living president to receive the honor.[217] Soon afterwards the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation created the Ronald Reagan Freedom Award for people who made a big change for freedom.[218] In 1990, Reagan wrote an autobiography titled, An American Life.[138] In May 1994, Reagan, along with former presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, wrote to the U.S. House of Representatives in support of banning \"semi-automatic assault guns.\"[219] On April 13, 1992, Reagan was assaulted by an anti-nuclear protester during a speech while accepting an award from the National Association of Broadcasters in Las Vegas.[220] The protester was Richard Paul Springer. He smashed a 2-foot-high (60 cm) 30-pound (13.5 kg) crystal statue of an eagle that the broadcasters had given to Reagan. Pieces of glass hit Reagan, but he was not injured.[221] Springer was the founder of an anti-nuclear group called the 100th Monkey. Following his arrest on assault charges, a Secret Service spokesman did not say how Springer got past the agents.[222] Later, Springer pled guilty to the federal charge of interfering with the Secret Service, but other felony charges of assault and fighting against officers were dropped.[223] Early in his presidency, Reagan started wearing a hearing aid, first in his right ear[224] and later in his left as well.[225][226] In 1985, he had colon cancer and skin cancer removed at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.[227] In 1987, Reagan had surgery to remove a polyp of the nose.[227] Also in that year, Reagan went into surgery for an enlarged prostate.[228] In her memoirs, former CBS White House correspondent Lesley Stahl remembers her final meeting with the president in 1986.[229] She said that \"Reagan didn't seem to know who I was. I have to go out on the lawn tonight and tell my countrymen that the president of the United States is a doddering space cadet.\"[229] At the end of the meeting, Stahl saw that Reagan became focused again. She later said that \"I had come that close to reporting that Reagan was senile.\"[229] On January 7, 1989, Reagan had surgery at the Reed Army Medical Center to fix a Dupuytren's contracture of the ring finger of his left hand.[230] The surgery lasted for more than three hours.[230] Eight months later in September, Reagan had surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota to remove fluid from his brain because of an injury from falling off a horse.[231] The surgery lasted just over an hour.[231] In 1994, Reagan was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.[232][233] On November 5, 1994, Reagan wrote a public letter about having Alzheimer's disease.[232] In the letter, Reagan said that he was \"one of the millions of Americans who will be [affected] with Alzheimer's disease\" and that he will begin \"the journey that will lead me into the sunset of my life\".[234] After announcing his disease, many people sent supporting letters to his California home.[235] There was also an opinion based on unfinished evidence that Reagan had shown symptoms of mental decline while still in office.[236] In 1995, the Ronald and Nancy Reagan Research Institute was dedicated in Chicago, Illinois.[237] It is an institution that can help people with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.[237] Reagan fell at his Bel Air home on January 13, 2001. He broke his hip.[238] The fracture was repaired the next day. Reagan, 89 years old, returned home later that week, but he then had to do difficult physical therapy at home.[238] As the years went on, Alzheimer's disease slowly destroyed Reagan's mental capacity.[239] He was only able to recognize a few people, including his wife, Nancy.[239] He remained active during his last years. He took walks through parks near his home and on beaches, played golf regularly, and until 1999 he often went to his office in nearby Century City.[239] On February 6, 2001, Reagan reached the age of 90, becoming the third former president to do so (the other two being John Adams and Herbert Hoover, with Gerald Ford, George H. W. Bush, and Jimmy Carter later reaching 90).[240] Reagan appeared in public not as much as the disease got worse. His family said that he would live alone with his wife Nancy. Nancy Reagan told CNN's Larry King in 2001 that very few visitors were allowed to see her husband because she felt that \"Ronnie would want people to remember him as he was.\"[241] In that same year, Reagan's daughter, Maureen Reagan, died from melanoma at the age of 60.[242] The USS Ronald Reagan (CVN-76) was finished in 2001.[243] A ceremony was held in March 2001.[243] Reagan's wife, Nancy lead the ceremony.[243] She christened the ship.[243] Reagan could not go because he was very sick.[243] Following her husband's diagnosis and death, Nancy became a stem-cell research advocate. She urged Congress and President George W. Bush to support federal funding for embryonic stem cell research. President Bush opposed the idea. In 2009, she praised President Barack Obama for lifting restrictions on such research.[244] Mrs. Reagan believed that it could lead to a cure for Alzheimer's.[245] Nancy died on March 6, 2016, at the age of 94.[48] On June 5, 2004, Reagan died at the age of 93 of pneumonia, caused by Alzheimer's disease, in his home in Bel Air, Los Angeles, California.[7] A short time after his death, Nancy Reagan released a statement saying, \"My family and I would like the world to know that President Ronald Reagan has died after 10 years of Alzheimer's disease at 93 years of age. We appreciate everyone's prayers.\"[246] Reagan was given a state funeral. His state funeral was the first in the United States since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1973.[247] It was held at the Washington National Cathedral on June 11 and presided by former Missouri United States senator John Danforth.[248] President George W. Bush and former presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, and Bill Clinton went to the funeral.[247] First Lady Laura Bush and former first ladies Betty Ford, Rosalynn Carter, and Barbara Bush also went.[247] Former First Lady Lady Bird Johnson did not go to the funeral because of poor health. Reverend Billy Graham, who was Reagan's first choice to lead the funeral, could not go because he was recovering from surgery.[249] Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor also went to the funeral and delivered a passage from the Bible.[249] The funeral was led by Reagan's close friend and pastor Michael Wenning.[250] Foreign leaders also went to Reagan's funeral, Mikhail Gorbachev, Prime Minister of United Kingdom Tony Blair, German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and interim presidents Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan and Ghazi al-Yawer of Iraq.[247] Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Margaret Thatcher, former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and both former President George H. W. Bush and President George W. Bush gave eulogies.[247] Reagan was buried later that day in an underground vault at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.[247][251] His tomb reads, \"I know in my heart that man is good. That what is right will always eventually triumph. And that there is purpose and worth to each and every life\".[252] Reagan, by public opinion, is one of the most popular American presidents.[253] His legacy is strongly admired among many conservatives and Republicans. According to USA Today, \"Reagan transformed the American presidency in ways that only a few have been able to.\"[254] His role in the Cold War made his image more popular as a different kind of leader as both Reagan and Gorbachev wanted to end nuclear tensions and the war.[255][256] Reagan ranked third of post–World War II presidents in a 2007 Rasmussen Reports poll, fifth in an ABC 2000 poll, ninth in another 2007 Rasmussen poll, and eighth in a late 2008 poll by British newspaper The Times.[257][258][259] In 2011, British historians released a survey to rate American presidents. This poll of British experts in American history and politics said that Reagan is the eighth greatest American president.[260] Some people of the opposite party, the Democratic Party, had some good thoughts about Reagan as well.[261] Democrats who support Reagan are called Reagan Democrats.[261] His presidency is sometimes called the Reagan Era because of the changes it brought during Reagan's time as president.[262] During his presidency, Reagan was known for his witty charm and his warm optimism.[263] Reagan was also supported by young voters, who began to support the Republican party as a result.[7][264] The legacy of his economic policies is still divided between people who believe that the government should be smaller and those who believe the government should take a more active role in regulating the economy.[5] Some saw that his tax cuts only helped the rich and ignored the poor.[5] While some of his foreign policies were not popular, many thank Reagan for peacefully ending the Cold War.[265] In 2019, an audio recording from 1971 of a conversation between Reagan and President Richard Nixon was released in which Reagan called African diplomats at the United Nations \"monkeys\". His quote has been called racist.[266][267][268] Reagan was known as the \"Teflon president\" because any criticism or scandals against him never stuck or affected his popularity.[269] In 2000, Ronald and Nancy Reagan received the Congressional Gold Medal in \"recognition for their service to their nation\".[270] In August 2004, a tribute to Reagan was shown at the 2004 Republican National Convention presented by his son, Michael Reagan.[271] In June 2007, Reagan received the Order of the White Eagle from Poland's president, Lech Kaczyński, for Reagan's work to end communism in Poland.[272] Nancy Reagan traveled to Warsaw to accept the award for her husband.[272] On June 3, 2009, a statue of Reagan was added in the United States Capitol rotunda. The statue represents the state of California in the National Statuary Hall Collection.[273] Following Reagan's death, both major American political parties agreed to place a statue of Reagan instead of that of Thomas Starr King.[274] Also in June 2009, President Obama signed the Ronald Reagan Centennial Commission Act into law.[275] It created a commission to plan activities to mark the upcoming centenary of Reagan's 100 birthday.[275] On July 4, 2011, a statue of Reagan was presented in London. It is outside of the American Embassy in Grosvenor Square.[276] The ceremony was supposed to be attended by Reagan's wife Nancy, but she did not attend. Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice took her place and read a statement from her. British Prime Minister during Reagan's presidency, Baroness Thatcher, was also unable to attend due to poor health.[276] A statue of Reagan was presented in November 2011 in Warsaw, Poland. President of Poland Lech Wałęsa was there.[277] February 6 has been known as Ronald Reagan Day in 21 states across the United States in honor of his birthday.[278] In 2011, Reagan was added to the National Radio Hall of Fame.[279] In 2016, Ronald and Nancy Reagan were honored in the Presidential $1 Coin Program in August 2016.[280] He was the last president honored in the program.[280]",

Ronald Reagan was elected President of the United States on November 4, 1980. His triumph capped the rise of the new right/conservative wing of the Republican Party and ushered in a new era of governing. Reagan served as arguably the first true conservative U.S. president in over 50 years. Reagan advanced domestic policies that featured a lessening of federal government responsibility in solving social problems, reducing restrictions on business, and implementing tax cuts. Internationally, Reagan demonstrated a fierce opposition to the spread of communism throughout the world and a strong distrust of the Soviet Union, which in 1983 he labeled an \"evil empire.\" He championed a rearmed and strong military and was especially supportive of the MX missile system and the Strategic Defense Initiative (\"Star Wars\") program. Economic Policy When Reagan took office the economy was one of double-digit inflation and interest rates near 20%. During the campaign Reagan promised to restore the free market from excessive government regulation and encourage private initiative and enterprise. Reagan's economic policies highlighted his long-standing dislike of high federal income taxes. Reagan embraced the theory of \"supply side economics,\" feeling that tax cuts encouraged economic expansion which would result in increases in federal government revenue at a lower tax rate. Higher revenues would then be used to increase defense spending and balance the federal budget. This overall approach became known as \"Reaganomics,\" or as Republican primary candidate Vice President George H.W. Bush once called it, \"voodoo economics.\" The President also vowed to protect certain entitlement programs (like Medicare and Social Security) while cutting the budgets for other social programs by targeting waste, fraud and abuse. During his first year in office, Reagan engineered the passage of $39 billion in budget cuts into law, as well as a massive 25 percent tax cut spread over three years for individuals, and faster write-offs for capital investment for business. At the same time, he insisted on, and for the most part, was successful in gaining increased funding for defense. Although inflation dropped from 13.5% in 1980 to 5.1% in 1982, a severe recession set in, with unemployment exceeding 10% in October, 1982 for the first time in forty years. The administration modified its economic policy after two years by proposing selected tax increases and budget cuts to control rising deficits and higher interest rates. After the 1982 downturn, the reduced inflation rate (under 5% for the remainder of the administration), lowering interest rates, and added discretionary income from tax cuts sparked record economic growth, and produced one of the lowest unemployment rates in modern U.S. history (unemployment hit a 14 year low in June of 1988). As Reagan left office, the nation was experiencing its sixth consecutive year of economic prosperity. The economic gains, however, came at a cost of a record annual deficit and a ballooning national debt. The budget deficit was exacerbated by a trade deficit. Americans continued to buy more foreign-made goods than they were selling. Reagan, however adhered to his free trade stance, and was the primary proponent of the Free Trade Agreement with Canada, which evolved into the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). He also signed, reluctantly, trade legislation designed to open foreign markets to U.S. goods. Domestic Affairs Reagan's domestic policies had a major impact on the American people and have had for many years. He followed up the passage of the largest tax cut in U.S. history by supporting and signing into law the Tax Reform law of 1986. Reagan led the battle for a Social Security reform bill designed to ensure the long-term solvency of the system, and oversaw the passage of immigration reform legislation, as well as the expansion of the Medicare program to protect the elderly and disabled against \"catastrophic\" health costs. Reagan elevated William Rehnquist to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and appointed three justices to the bench: Anthony Kennedy, Antonin Scalia, and the first woman named to the Supreme Court, Sandra Day O'Connor. Part of the New Right's basic beliefs was that \"judicial activism\" was un-Constitutional and judges should be selected by an adherence to \"judicial restraint.\" Reagan's judicial selections were based on this principle. Reagan consistently received very high approval ratings. He was not popular with some minority groups, particularly African-Americans, many of whom did not benefit from the economic prosperity. In 1986, over 30 percent of the black population had an income below the official poverty level. While many labor leaders disliked Reagan, especially after he fired the air traffic controllers when they refused to end their strike (1981), he was popular with labor union members. Reagan encouraged the development of \"private sector initiatives\" as well as federalism, with the objective of transferring from the federal government some of the responsibilities believed to be better served by private business or state and local government. As the president called for international cooperation to stop the influx of illegal drugs, especially cocaine, into the U.S., First Lady Nancy Reagan led the campaign against drug abuse, urging the nation's youth to \"just say no.\" Foreign Policy At the heart of Reagan's foreign policy was preventing communist expansion in the world. US actions throughout the world demonstrated this including strong financial and military support of the Contras against the communist Nicaraguan government, the aid given to the government of El Salvador in their fight against the communist guerrillas, the U.S invasion of Grenada when that nation was perceived as falling under Cuban domination in 1983, the support given to UNITA anti-communist fighters in the Angolan Civil War involving Cuban proxy troops, and the support given to rebels fighting Soviet troops in Afghanistan. These combined efforts were named \"The Reagan Doctrine.\" While efforts for peace in Central America faltered, the Soviets announced the withdrawal of forces from Afghanistan in 1988, and the Angola conflict was successfully negotiated with a withdrawal of Cuban troops. Reagan believed that the nation should negotiate with the Soviet Union from a position of strength. To such an end, the administration embarked on a strategic modernization program which included the production of an intercontinental missile, a stengthened navy, and a feasibility study for the Strategic Defense Initiative. The increase in military spending, and the rise of Mikhail Gorbachev as General Secretary of the Soviet Union at the beginning of Reagan's second term, opened a new era of relations between the two superpowers. After a number of meetings between Reagan and Gorbachev, the two men signed an Intermediate Nuclear Force (INF) Treaty at the Washington Summit in December, 1987. The agreement promised to eliminate an entire class of intermediate-range nuclear missiles and was the first arms control agreement in history to reduce the nuclear arsenal. In addition, the administration began the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START) which would reduce the strategic nuclear arsenals by 50%, including large multiple warhead missiles. When pro-U.S. dictators in Haiti and the Philippines appeared on the verge of being toppled from power, Reagan engineered their safe removal from their countries, ensuring bloodless coups and new government which, he hoped, would be friendly to the U.S. In Middle East affairs, Reagan reported in his inaugural address that the 52 American hostages held in Iran for 444 days were at that moment being released and would soon return to freedom. The President maintained a firm stance against terrorism, exemplified by the American retaliating against Libya for an air attack in 1981 and again in 1986 for the death of Americans in a Berlin discotheque. Reagan's peacekeeping force in war-torn Lebanon experienced tragedy in 1983 when a truck bomb killed 241 soldiers. Tragedy struck again in 1987 when a missile from an Iraqi warplane killed 37 sailors aboard the U.S.S. Stark, part of a U.S. naval taskforce which had been sent to the Persian Gulf to keep that waterway open during the Iran-Iraq war. The darkest hour of the Reagan administration would become known as the Iran-Contra affair. After lengthy, nationally televised hearings, a special congressional hearings review board reported that Reagan authorized the sale of arms to Iran in exchange for help in freeing U.S. hostages in Lebanon. Investigations revealed the money gained from the arms sale was illegally diverted to aid the Contras, opponents of the Nicaraguan Sandinista government. The congressional report criticized Reagan for his detached, hands-off style of management. In the aftermath of the affair, National Security Advisors Robert McFarlane and John Poindexter, as well as National Security Council aide Colonel Oliver North were indicted by a federal grand jury and convicted of various charges regarding the Iran-Contra operations. McFarlane was later pardoned by President George H.W. Bush and both Poindexter and North's convictions were set aside on appeal for technical reasons. The Reagan Legacy The eight years of the Reagan presidency was one of the most dynamic periods, in recent U.S. history, resulting in a major refocusing of the nation's social, business, and international agenda. More importantly, his election changed the demographic composition of the Republican Party and built the core beliefs still practiced today: lower taxes, less government restrictions on businesses and individuals and a strong military. Few presidents have enjoyed the affection of so many of the American people. Support for Ronald Reagan grew when he was seriously wounded by an assassin's bullet in 1981 and during major surgical procedures in 1985 and 1987. Reagan was known as the \"Great Communicator,\" and often went on television to ask the viewers for their support for a particular piece of legislation. When he ran for a second term in 1984 against former Vice-President Walter Mondale, Reagan stood by his record and asked the voters if they were better off now than they were four years ago. At 73 years of age, Reagan became, at the time, the oldest man ever elected president, receiving 525 electoral votes, the most of any presidential candidate. As his second term ended, polls showed that more than half of the American people gave him a favorable rating. When Ronald Reagan became president, he had a distinct vision of what the nation should be and spelled out the direction he hoped it would take during his administration. Reagan had a clear social, economic, and foreign policy agenda, and with political guile and personal persuasiveness he was able to achieve many of his goals. Early in his presidency, Reagan remarked: \"What I'd really like to do is go down in history as the President who made Americans believe in themselves again.\" A month before the election of his successor, Reagan looked back on his eight years in office: \"I am the same man I was when I came to Washington,\" he said, \"I believe the same things I believed when I came to Washington, and I think those beliefs have been vindicated by the success of the policies to which we hold fast.\" About his foreign policy, he said, \"At every point on the map that the Soviets have applied pressure, we've done all we can to apply pressure against them.\" He went on \"And now we are seeing a sight many believed they would never see in our lifetime: the receding of the tide of totalitarianism.\" Reagan lived to see the dismantling of the Soviet Union's communist empire and it's retreat from surrounding neighboring countries which ultimately resulted in the toppling of the Berlin Wall in the fall of 1989. 40 Presidential Drive Simi Valley, CA 93065 800-410-8354 reagan.library@nara.gov Museum Hours Mon-Sun 10am-5pm Research Room Hours Mon-Fri 9am-5pm Appointments Are Required Holiday and Special Event HoursClosed Thanksgiving Day,Christmas Day, and New Year's Day",

                "content": "Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (Spanish pronunciation: [reˈal maˈðɾið ˈkluβ ðe ˈfuðβol] ⓘ), commonly referred to as Real Madrid, is a Spanish professional football club based in Madrid. The club competes in La Liga, the top tier of Spanish football. Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since its inception. The honorific title real is Spanish for \"royal\" and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 alongside with the crown in the club crest. Real Madrid have played their home matches in the 85,000-capacity Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting clubs, Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout its history. The official Madrid anthem is the \"Hala Madrid y nada más\", written by RedOne and Manuel Jabois.[8] The club is one of the most widely supported in the world and is the most followed football club on social media according to the CIES Football Observatory as of 2023.[9][10] It was estimated to be worth $6.6 billion in 2024, making it the world's most valuable football club.[11] In 2024, Real Madrid become the first football club to make €1 billion ($1.08bn) in revenue according to the club's announcement.[12] Real Madrid are one of the most successful clubs in the sport. In domestic football, the club has won 71 trophies; a record 36 La Liga titles, 20 Copa del Rey, 13 Supercopa de España, a Copa Eva Duarte and a Copa de la Liga.[13] In International football, Real Madrid have won a record 35 trophies: a record 15 European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, a record six UEFA Super Cups, two UEFA Cups, a joint record two Latin Cups, a record one Iberoamerican Cup, and a record nine FIFA Club World championships.[note 1] Madrid was ranked first in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 2000, 2002, 2014, 2017.[17] In UEFA, Madrid ranks first in the all-time club ranking.[18][19] Being one of the three founding members of La Liga that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929 (along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona), Real Madrid has many long-standing rivalries, most notably El Clásico with Barcelona and El Derbi Madrileño with Atlético Madrid. The club established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s and 60s, winning five consecutive and six overall European Cups and reaching a further two finals. This success was replicated on the domestic front, with Madrid winning 12 league titles in 16 years. This team, which included Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás, Paco Gento and Raymond Kopa is considered, by some in the sport, to be the greatest of all time.[20][21] Real Madrid is known for its Galácticos policy, which involves signing the world's best players, such as Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane and David Beckham to create a superstar team.[22] The term 'Galácticos policy' generally refers to the two eras of Florentino Pérez's presidency of the club (2000–2006 and 2009–2018); however, players brought in just before his tenure are sometimes considered to be part of the Galácticos legacy. A notable example is Steve McManaman, who like many other players also succeeded under the policy.[23] On 26 June 2009, Madrid signed Cristiano Ronaldo for a record-breaking £80 million (€94 million);[24] he became both the club's and history's all-time top goalscorer.[25][26][27][28] Madrid have recently relaxed the Galácticos policy, instead focusing on signing young talents such as Vinícius Júnior, Rodrygo, Jude Bellingham[29] and Kylian Mbappé.[30][31] Real Madrid is recognised as the greatest football club of the 20th century by FIFA and as the best European club during the same timeframe by the IFFHS,[32] while also receiving the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit in 2004.[33] Real Madrid has the highest participations in the European Cup/Champions League (55),[18] a tournament in which they hold the overall record for the most wins, most draws and most goals scored.[34] Real Madrid is the only club to have won three consecutive titles (three-peat) in the European Cup/Champions League twice, first in 1955–56, 1956–57, and 1957–58, and second in 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18 and was the first and the only club to win La Decima (in 2013-14).[35] In June 2024, they won a record-extending 15th Champions League title (the sixth in eleven seasons), recognised as such by Guinness World Records.[36] Real Madrid is the first club across all of Europe's top-five leagues to win 100 trophies in all competitions.[37] As of July 2024,[update] Real Madrid are ranked 2nd in the UEFA club rankings and first in last 10 years (2013–2023) overall.[38][39] Real Madrid's origins go back to when football was introduced to Madrid by the academics and students of the Institución Libre de Enseñanza, which included several Cambridge and Oxford University graduates.[40] They founded (Sociedad) Sky Football in 1897, commonly known as La Sociedad (The Society) as it was the only one based in Madrid, playing on Sunday mornings at Moncloa. In 1900, conflict between members caused some of them to leave and create a new club, Nueva Sociedad de Football (New Society of Football), to distinguish themselves from Sky Football. Among the dissenters were Julián Palacios, recognized as the first Real Madrid president, Juan Padrós and Carlos Padrós, the latter two being brothers and future presidents of Real Madrid. In 1901, this new club was renamed as Madrid Football Club. Later, following a restructuring in 1902, Sky was renamed as \"New Foot-Ball Club\".[41][42][43] On 6 March 1902, after a new Board presided by Juan Padrós had been elected, Madrid Football Club was officially founded.[7] The Padrós brothers summoned other football enthusiasts to a meeting in the back room of Al Capricho, the family business. They viewed football as a mass sport that should be accessible to representatives of all social classes, and thought the new club should embody that idea. The brothers proposed the name, Madrid Football Club, which was unanimously accepted. The membership fee was also set, two pesetas a month, and the color of the shirt was chosen to be white in honour of a famous English team Corinthian, which Juan Padrós had met on one of his trips.[44][45] Three years after its founding, in 1905, Madrid FC won its first title after defeating Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Cup final. The club became one of the founding sides of the Royal Spanish Football Federation on 4 January 1909, when club president Adolfo Meléndez signed the foundation agreement of the Spanish FA. After moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912.[46] In 1920, the club's name was changed to Real Madrid after King Alfonso XIII granted the title of Real (Royal) to the club.[47] In 1929, the first Spanish football league was founded. Real Madrid led the first league season until the last match, a loss to Athletic Bilbao, meant they finished runners-up to Barcelona.[48] Real Madrid won its first league title in the 1931–32 season and retained it the following year.[49] On 14 April 1931, the arrival of the Second Spanish Republic caused the club to lose the title Real and the royal crown on its emblem, going back to being named Madrid Football Club until the end of the Spanish Civil War. Football continued during the Second World War, and on 13 June 1943, Madrid beat Barcelona 11–1 in the second leg of the Copa del Generalísimo semi-finals, the Spanish Cup having been renamed in honour of General Franco.[note 2][50] The first leg, played at the Les Corts in Catalonia, had ended with Barcelona winning 3–0. Madrid complained about all the three goals that referee Fombona Fernández had allowed for Barcelona,[51] with the home supporters also whistling Madrid throughout, whom they accused of employing roughhouse tactics, and Fombona for allowing them to. The newspaper Ya reported the whistling as a \"clear intention to attack the representatives of Spain.\"[52] Barcelona fans were banned from traveling to Madrid. The day of the second leg, the Barcelona team were insulted and stones were thrown at their bus as soon as they left their hotel. Barcelona's striker Mariano Gonzalvo said of the incident, \"Five minutes before the game had started, our penalty area was already full of coins.\" Barcelona goalkeeper Luis Miró rarely approached his line—when he did, he was armed with stones. As Francisco Calvet told the story, \"They were shouting: Reds! Separatists!... a bottle just missed Sospedra that would have killed him if it had hit him. It was all set up.\"[53] Real Madrid went 2–0 up within half an hour. The third goal brought with it a sending off for Barcelona's Benito García after he made what Calvet claimed was a \"completely normal tackle\". Madrid's José Llopis Corona recalled: \"At which point, they got a bit demoralized,\" while Ángel Mur countered, \"at which point, we thought: 'go on then, score as many as you want'.\"[54] Madrid made it 8–0 by half-time; two goals were also ruled out for offside, and proceeded to score a further three goals in the second half, to which Barcelona replied with a late consolation goal.[55] According to football writer Sid Lowe, \"There have been relatively few mentions of the game [since] and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid. Indeed, the 11–1 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelona's history. This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims.\"[51] Fernando Argila, Barcelona's reserve goalkeeper from the 1943 match, said: \"There was no rivalry. Not, at least, until that game.\"[56] Santiago Bernabéu became president of Real Madrid in 1943.[57] Under his presidency, the club was rebuilt after the Civil War, and he oversaw the construction of the club's current stadium, Estadio Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (now known as the Santiago Bernabéu), and its training facilities Ciudad Deportiva. Additionally, during the 1950s former Real Madrid Amateurs player Miguel Malbo founded Real Madrid's youth academy, or \"cantera,\" known today as La Fábrica. Beginning in 1953, he embarked upon a strategy of signing world-class players from abroad, the most prominent being Alfredo Di Stéfano.[58] In 1955, acting upon the idea proposed by Gabriel Hanot, a French sports journalist and editor of L'Équipe, Bernabéu, Ernest Bedrignan (deputy chairman of the Ligue de Football Professionnel)[59] and Gusztáv Sebes created the European Cup, a continental tournament for the league champions around Europe, which is today known as the UEFA Champions League.[60] It was under Bernabéu's guidance that Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football. The club won the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included the 7–3 Hampden Park final against Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960.[58] After these five consecutive successes, Real was permanently awarded the original cup and earned the right to wear the UEFA badge of honour.[61] Real Madrid's achievements in Europe were built upon its unprecedented domestic dominance, with the club winning twelve league titles out of sixteen possible from 1953–54 to 1968–69, including a five-in-a-row sequence in 1961–65, and finishing runners-up a further three times.[62] The club won the European Cup for a sixth time in 1966, defeating Partizan Belgrade 2–1 in the final with a team composed entirely of same nationality players, a first in the competition.[63] This team became known as the Yé-yé. The name \"Yé-yé\" came from the \"Yeah, yeah, yeah\" chorus in The Beatles' song \"She Loves You\" after four members of the team posed for Marca and impersonated the Beatles.[64] The Yé-yé generation was also European Cup runners-up in 1962[65] and 1964.[63] In the 1970s, Real Madrid won six league championships and three Spanish Cups.[66] The club competed in its first European Cup Winners' Cup in 1970–71 and progressed all the way to the final, where it lost to English side Chelsea 2–1 in a replay.[67] On 2 July 1978, club president Santiago Bernabéu died while the World Cup was being played in Argentina. FIFA decreed three days of mourning to honour him during the tournament.[68] The following year, the club organized the first edition of the Trofeo Santiago Bernabéu in memory of its former president. Bernabéu had been Real Madrid's president for almost 35 years, during which his club won one Intercontinental Cup, six European Cups, 16 league titles, six Spanish Cups, two Latin Cups and one Copa Eva Duarte.[69] In the early 1980s, Real Madrid had lost its grasp on the La Liga title, until a new cohort of home-grown stars brought domestic success back to the club.[70][71] Spanish sports journalist Julio César Iglesias gave to this generation the name La Quinta del Buitre (\"Vulture's Cohort\"), which was derived from the nickname given to one of its members, Emilio Butragueño. The other four members were Manolo Sanchís, Martín Vázquez, Míchel and Miguel Pardeza. All five footballers were graduates of Real Madrid's youth academy.[70][71] With La Quinta del Buitre (reduced to four members when Pardeza left for Zaragoza in 1986) and notable players like goalkeeper Francisco Buyo, right-back Miguel Porlán Chendo and Mexican striker Hugo Sánchez, Real Madrid had one of the best teams in Spain and Europe during the second half of the 1980s, winning two UEFA Cups, five Spanish championships in a row, one Spanish Cup, and three Spanish Super Cups.[70][71] In the early 1990s, La Quinta del Buitre split up after Martín Vázquez, Emilio Butragueño and Míchel left the club. In 1996, President Lorenzo Sanz appointed Fabio Capello as coach.[72] Although his tenure lasted only one season, Real Madrid were proclaimed league champions, and players like Predrag Mijatović, Davor Šuker, Clarence Seedorf, Roberto Carlos and keeper Bodo Illgner, arrived at the club to strengthen a squad that already boasted the likes of Raúl, Fernando Hierro and Fernando Redondo. As a result, Real Madrid (with the addition of Fernando Morientes in 1997) finally ended its 32-year wait for its seventh European Cup: in 1998, under manager Jupp Heynckes, they defeated Juventus 1–0 in the final with a goal from Mijatović.[73] In November 1999, Vicente del Bosque took over as coach. For the last season of the century, 1999–2000, the squad was still led by the older veterans such as Fernando Hierro, Fernando Redondo, Roberto Carlos and Raúl. Real added the budding young talents of Guti and Iker Casillas, supported by the arrival of Steve McManaman and Nicolas Anelka from the English Premier League, alongside local talents Míchel Salgado and Iván Helguera. In Del Bosque's first season in charge, Real won the Champions League for the eighth time, following a 3–0 victory over Valencia in the final, with goals from Morientes, McManaman and Raúl.[74] This victory marked the beginning of a successful period in Real Madrid's history.[75] In July 2000, Florentino Pérez was elected club president.[76] He vowed in his campaign to erase the club's €270 million debt and modernize the club's facilities. However, the primary electoral promise that propelled Pérez to victory was the signing of Luís Figo from arch-rivals Barcelona.[77] The following year, the club had its training ground rezoned and used the money to begin assembling the Galácticos team by signing a global star every summer, which included Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Luís Figo, David Beckham and Fabio Cannavaro.[78] It is debatable whether the gamble paid off, as despite winning the UEFA Champions League and an Intercontinental Cup in 2002, followed by La Liga in 2003, the club failed to win a major trophy for the next three seasons. Off the pitch, the Zidanes y Pavones policy resulted in increased financial success based on the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, particularly in Asia.[79] The few days after the capturing of the 2003 La Liga title were surrounded with controversy. The first controversial decision came when Pérez sacked winning coach Vicente del Bosque.[80] Over a dozen players left the club, including Madrid captain Fernando Hierro, while defensive midfielder Claude Makélélé refused to take part in training in protest at being one of the lowest-paid players at the club and subsequently moved to Chelsea.[81] \"That's a lot [of players leaving] when the normal rule is: never change a winning team,\" stated Zidane.[82] Real Madrid, with newly appointed coach Carlos Queiroz, started their domestic league slowly after a hard win over Real Betis.[82] The 2005–06 season began with the promise of several new signings: Júlio Baptista (€24 million), Robinho (€30 million), and Sergio Ramos (€27 million).[83] However, Real Madrid suffered from some poor results, including a 0–3 loss at the hands of Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu in November 2005.[84] Madrid's coach Wanderley Luxemburgo was sacked the following month and his replacement was Juan Ramón López Caro.[85] A brief return to form came to an abrupt halt after Madrid lost the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-finals 6–1 to Real Zaragoza,[86] a defeat that was nearly reversed with a 4–0 home victory. Shortly after, Real Madrid were eliminated from the Champions League for a fourth successive year, this time at the hands of Arsenal. On 27 February 2006, Florentino Pérez resigned.[87] Ramón Calderón was elected as club president on 2 July 2006 and subsequently appointed Fabio Capello as the new coach and Predrag Mijatović as the new sporting director. Real Madrid won the Liga title in 2007 for the first time in four years, but Capello was nonetheless sacked at the end of the campaign.[88] The title was won on 17 June, where Real faced Mallorca at the Bernabéu while Barcelona and Sevilla, the other title challengers, faced Gimnàstic de Tarragona and Villarreal, respectively. At half-time, Real were 0–1 down, while Barcelona had surged ahead into a 0–3 lead in Tarragona. However, three goals in the last half-hour secured Madrid a 3–1 win and their first league title since 2003.[89] Real Madrid repeated as league winners in 2007–08, but the following season ended up being one of the most disastrous in the club's history: Real was knocked out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage for the fifth time in a row, losing to Liverpool 0–5 on aggregate, and was embarrassed by Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu with a humiliating 2–6 loss, which all but confirmed the league title for Barça that went on to win the treble.[90] On 1 June 2009, Florentino Pérez regained Real Madrid's presidency amid the outrage over the club's decline.[91][92] Pérez continued with the Galácticos policy pursued in his first term, buying Kaká from Milan for a record-breaking (in pounds sterling) sum of £56 million,[93] and then breaking the record again by purchasing Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United for £80 million.[94] Real Madrid spent in excess of €261 million in the summer of 2009, and the assembled team was soon dubbed the Second Galácticos.[95] The 2009–10 season, however, was a transitional one as Madrid again finished second in the league, although this time amassing 96 points, the club's record at the time, and went out of the Champions League at the hands of Lyon. The season was marred by Cristiano Ronaldo's injury, that sidelined him for seven weeks,[96] although he still topped the goalscoring charts with 33 goals, and Madrid became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals. Real Madrid also had the misfortune to become the runners-up with the highest points total in the history of Europe's top five leagues, until surpassed by Liverpool's 97 points in 2018–19.[97][98] José Mourinho took over as manager in May 2010.[99][100] In the 2010–11 season, the rebuilt Madrid successfully fought on all fronts, going toe to toe with a brilliant Barcelona side which some regard as the greatest team in football history. Ultimately, Madrid finished second in the league, with 92 points and four behind their perennial rivals, defeated them in the Copa del Rey final, and lost to Barça in the Champions League semi-finals, where Real progressed to for the first time since 2002–03. Moreover, from 16 April through 3 May, a rare occurrence happened when, for the first time ever, four Clásicos were to be played in a span of just 18 days. The first fixture was in the league campaign on 16 April (which ended 1–1 with penalty goals for both sides), the second one was in the Copa del Rey final (which was won by Madrid 1–0 a.e.t., bringing them their first trophy in the second Galáctico era) on 20 April and the third and fourth ones in the controversial[101][102] two-legged Champions League semi-finals on 27 April and 3 May (Barcelona won on aggregate with a 2–0 away victory and a 1–1 home draw).[103] Madrid again became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals, repeating its output from the previous season, with Ronaldo scoring 40 and winning the European Golden Shoe. In the 2011–12 season, Real Madrid won La Liga for a record 32nd time in its history, also finishing the season with numerous league records set, including 100 points amassed in a single season, a total of 121 goals scored, a goal difference of +89, 16 away games won, and 32 wins overall.[104] They also competed in the UEFA Champions League for the 15th successive season,[105] losing in the semi-finals to Bayern Munich in a penalty shoot-out after a 3–3 aggregate tie. Madrid entered the Copa del Rey as the defending champions, but lost 3–4 on aggregate in the quarter-finals to Barcelona. In the same season, Cristiano Ronaldo became the fastest player to reach 100 goals scored in Spanish league history. In reaching 101 goals in 92 games, Ronaldo surpassed Real Madrid legend Ferenc Puskás, who scored 100 goals in 105 matches. Ronaldo set a new club mark for individual goals scored in one year (60) and became the first player ever to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single season.[106][107] Real Madrid started the 2012–13 season by winning the Supercopa de España, defeating Barcelona on away goals. However, the super cup turned out to be their only trophy of the season, despite being close to win them all. Real finished runners-up to Barça in La Liga, accumulating 85 points, and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League for the third year in a row, where they were eliminated by Borussia Dortmund 3–4 on aggregate. Madrid also entered the Copa del Rey in the round of 32, going on a memorable run to the final, which saw them defeat Barcelona in the semi-finals before losing to Atlético Madrid 1–2 a.e.t. Real Madrid faced the Blaugrana six times throughout the season, coming away with three wins, two draws, and one loss. A major transfer of the season was the signing of Luka Modrić from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in the region of £33 million.[108] After a loss to Atlético in the Copa del Rey final, Pérez announced the departure of José Mourinho at the end of the season by \"mutual agreement\".[109] On 25 June 2013, Carlo Ancelotti succeeded Mourinho to become the manager of Real Madrid on a three-year deal, with Zinedine Zidane named as one of his assistants.[110] On 1 September 2013, the long-awaited transfer of Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur was announced. The transfer of the Welshman was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer price approximated at €100 million.[111] In Ancelotti's first season at the club, Real Madrid fought on all three fronts for the continental treble. Despite leading in the league campaign on multiple occasions, Madrid ultimately finished in third place (level on points with Barcelona and three behind cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid), collecting 87 points in total and scoring a record 104 goals.[112] By that time, Los Blancos had already secured the Copa del Rey – against rivals Barcelona – in April, with Bale scoring the winner.[113] The major breakthrough came in the UEFA Champions League, where Real returned to the final after twelve years, having beaten defending champions Bayern Munich 5–0 on aggregate in the semi-finals.[114] In the final, they defeated then-recently-league winners Atlético Madrid 4–1 a.e.t. to clinch their tenth European Cup (first since 2002) and become the first team to win ten European Cups/Champions League titles, an achievement known as \"La Décima\" (Spanish: \"The Tenth,\" [la ˈðeθima]).[115] Real's attacking trio of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, dubbed the BBC, finished the season with 97 goals.[116] After winning the 2014 Champions League, Real Madrid signed goalkeeper Keylor Navas, midfielder Toni Kroos and attacking midfielder James Rodríguez.[117] In August, Madrid won the 2014 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, the club's 79th official trophy.[118] During the last week of the 2014 summer transfer window, Real Madrid sold two players key to the previous season's successes: Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich and Ángel Di María to Manchester United. This decision by the club was surrounded by controversy, with Cristiano Ronaldo stating, \"If I was in charge, maybe I would have done things differently,\" while Carlo Ancelotti admitted, \"We must start again from zero.\"[119] After a slow start to the 2014–15 season, Real Madrid went on a record-breaking 22-match winning streak, which included wins against Barcelona and Liverpool, surpassing the previous Spanish record of 18 successive wins set by Frank Rijkaard's Barça in the 2005–06 season.[120] In late December, Real Madrid won their first Club World Cup, defeating San Lorenzo 2–0 in the final.[121] The winning streak came to an end in their opening match of 2015 with a loss to Valencia, leaving the club two short of equalling the world record of 24 consecutive wins.[122] Madrid was in contention for both the La Liga title and the UEFA Champions League until the end but ultimately came up short, finishing with 92 points in the league, two behind treble-winning Barcelona and losing to Juventus 2–3 on aggregate in the Champions League semi-finals.[123] Ronaldo finished the season scoring 48 league goals, winning his fourth European Golden Shoe, and 61 goals in all competitions, breaking his record from 2011 to 2012.[124] Overall, despite playing an attractive attacking football and being the highest scoring team in Europe with 118 league goals,[125] several narrow defeats meant that Real finished the season with two trophies out of six possible, which contributed to the dismissal of Carlo Ancelotti on 25 May 2015.[126][127] On 3 June 2015, Rafael Benítez was confirmed as the new Real Madrid manager for the 2015–16 season, signing a three-year contract.[128] Real Madrid remained unbeaten in the league until a 3–2 loss at Sevilla on the matchday 11. This was followed by a 0–4 home loss in the first Clásico of the season against Barcelona. Perhaps, his reign is best remembered by multiple lopsided wins achieved both in La Liga and the Champions League (6–0 vs Espanyol, 8–0 vs Malmö, 10–2 vs Rayo Vallecano and others). In the Copa del Rey round of 32, Real accidentally fielded an ineligible player in a 3–1 first leg win at Cádiz and was disqualified from the tournament two days later by the competition judge, despite protests from president Pérez.[129][130][131] In the meantime, Madrid comfortably topped their UCL group with 16 points and a +16 goal difference. Benítez was relieved of his duties on 4 January 2016 following allegations of unpopularity with supporters, displeasure with players and a failure to produce good results against top teams.[132] Benítez's departure was announced along with the promotion of Zinedine Zidane to his first head coaching role.[133] Under Zidane, Madrid managed to turn the odds in its favour, ultimately winning the Champions League, something no one expected. The notable results include a 2–1 away victory over reigning treble winners Barcelona, who were on a record-breaking winning streak, a fantastic comeback against Wolfsburg in the Champions League quarter-finals (after losing the away game 0–2, Madrid erased the deficit and won 3–0 at home, courtesy of a Cristiano Ronaldo hat-trick), as well as a 12-game winning streak to conclude the league campaign, meaning Real finished second, with 90 points and just one point behind champions Barcelona, coming agonizingly close to clinching the title and overcoming a 12-point deficit in the process.[134] Finally, on 28 May, Real Madrid's eleventh Champions League title was won thanks to a 5–3 penalty shoot-out victory over rivals Atlético Madrid after a 1–1 draw in the final, with the achievement being termed \"La Undécima\".[135][136][127] Real Madrid began their 2016–17 campaign, which was to be Zidane's first full season in charge of the club, with a victory in the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla.[137] On 10 December 2016, Madrid played their 35th-straight match without a loss, which set a new club record.[138] On 18 December 2016, the club defeated Japanese outfit Kashima Antlers 4–2 in the final of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup.[139] With a 3–3 draw at Sevilla in the second leg of the Copa del Rey round of 16 on 12 January 2017, Madrid progressed to the quarter-finals with a 6–3 aggregate victory and extended its unbeaten run to 40 matches, breaking Barcelona's Spanish record of 39 matches unbeaten in all competitions from the previous season.[140] Their unbeaten streak ended after a 1–2 away loss against the same opposition in La Liga three days later.[141] The team then was knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Celta Vigo 3–4 on aggregate. These slips, however, did not affect the overall trajectory of the season. In May, Madrid won the league title for a record 33rd time, their first title in five years, accumulating 93 points in the process.[142] On 3 June 2017, the club's victory over Juventus in the Champions League final resulted in Real Madrid becoming the first team to successfully defend their title in the UEFA Champions League era, and the first to win consecutive titles in the competition since Milan in 1989 and 1990, when the tournament was known as the European Cup.[143][144] Real Madrid's title was its 12th, extending the record, and its third in four years. The achievement is also known as \"La Duodécima\".[145] The 2016–17 season was the greatest campaign in terms of trophies won (four out of possible five) in the history of Real Madrid, an achievement that would be later equalled in the 2017–18 season.[146] Real kicked off the 2017–18 campaign by winning its second consecutive and fourth overall UEFA Super Cup in a 2–1 victory against Manchester United.[147] Five days later, Real Madrid beat Barcelona at the Camp Nou 3–1 in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de España and then defeated Barça 2–0 in the return leg, ending their 24 consecutive match scoring record in El Clásico matches and winning the second trophy of the season.[148] On 16 December 2017, Real beat Brazilian club Grêmio 1–0 in the FIFA Club World Cup final and became the first team to retain the trophy.[149] In the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, Madrid once again progressed to the final where they defeated Liverpool 3–1 to become the first club to win three straight titles in the Champions League era, as well as the first team to win three consecutive titles in the European Cup/Champions League since Bayern Munich in 1976. The trophy also marked Madrid's fourth win in five years and their eighth consecutive semi-finals appearance. On 31 May, only five days after winning the final, Zidane announced his resignation as Real Madrid manager, citing the club's \"need for change\" as his rationale for departing.[150][151] Zidane's and Ronaldo's departures marked the end of the Second Galáctico Era that yielded four Champions League titles, two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey, two Supercopa de España, three UEFA Super Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cup titles. The team was instrumental in ending Barcelona's dominance, despite the Blaugrana boasting arguably the greatest collection of talent in history,[152] and overshadowed the Catalans on the European stage.[153] Real Madrid was also somewhat notoriously unlucky in its league campaigns throughout these nine years, finishing runners-up with 96, 92 (twice) and 90 points, as well as on 87 points in third place, just three off the league winners.[98] On 12 June 2018, Real Madrid named Julen Lopetegui, the head coach of the Spanish national team, as their new manager. It was announced that he would officially begin his managerial duties after the 2018 FIFA World Cup. However, the Spanish national team sacked Lopetegui a day prior to the tournament, stating that he had negotiated terms with the club without informing them.[154][155] The club then began re-shaping the squad in the summer of 2018, which included the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus for a reported €117 million.[156] Madrid began their 2018–19 campaign by losing to Atlético Madrid 2–4 a.e.t. in the 2018 UEFA Super Cup. After a 1–5 loss to Barcelona in El Clásico on 28 October which left Real Madrid in the ninth place with only 14 points after ten games, Lopetegui was dismissed a day later and replaced by then Castilla coach, Santiago Solari.[157] On 22 December 2018, Real Madrid beat Al Ain 4–1 in the FIFA Club World Cup and became the outright record winners of the Club World Cup with four titles.[158] However, they were then knocked out of the Copa del Rey at the semi-final stage by Barcelona, losing 1–4 on aggregate. On 5 March 2019, Real was defeated by Ajax 1–4 (3–5 on aggregate) at home, crashing out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage after eight consecutive semi-finals appearances. On 11 March 2019, Real Madrid dismissed Solari and reinstated Zidane as the head coach of the club.[159] Madrid finished the season with 68 points and a +17 goal difference, its lowest totals since 2001–02 and 1999–2000 respectively.[160] In the summer of 2019, Madrid signed Eden Hazard, Luka Jović, Éder Militão, Ferland Mendy, Rodrygo, Reinier and other players for a total of more than €350 million.[161] On 12 January 2020, Madrid beat cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid in a penalty shootout in the Supercopa de España final to win their eleventh title.[162] After a three-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, La Liga was restarted in June and Madrid won ten games in a row to capture the team's 34th league title, collecting 87 points in total.[163] From the competition's resumption in June and until the end of the 2020–21 season, Real temporarily played home fixtures at the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium, while the Santiago Bernabéu underwent extensive renovations.[164][165] Zidane left a second time on 27 May 2021 after going trophyless that season,[166] with Carlo Ancelotti returning to coach the team for the 2021–22 season.[167] On the domestic front, he delivered two trophies out of possible three, winning La Liga and the Supercopa de España.[168][169][170] As such, Ancelotti won all six available top trophies at Madrid.[171] In the Champions League, Madrid produced one of the most memorable runs of all time,[172] defeating pre-tournament favourites Paris Saint-Germain,[173][174] defending champions and favourites Chelsea,[175] Premier League champions and heavy favourites Manchester City,[176] all in dramatic fashion,[177] and setting up the final against Liverpool, who were once again widely considered as favourites,[178] in a rematch of their 2018 encounter. A lone Vinícius Júnior goal sealed the 14th European Cup for Los Blancos, their fifth in nine years, and Ancelotti's second in charge.[179][180] Real also claimed their fourth ever European double (after 1956–57, 1957–58, and 2016–17). Despite Real's status as the most decorated team in the history of the Champions League, they were not favoured to win that year's edition, and their improbable run was widely considered a surprise.[181] After a highly successful 2021–22 season, Real Madrid signed German defender Antonio Rüdiger and French midfielder Aurélien Tchouaméni, while club legends Marcelo, Isco, Gareth Bale and Casemiro left the club. Real Madrid's 2022–23 season began with lifting the UEFA Super Cup and later the FIFA Club World Cup. The season ended with Real Madrid winning the 2022–23 Copa del Rey, but losing the La Liga and Spanish Super Cup to FC Barcelona and the Champions League to Manchester City, being defeated 5–1 on aggregate. In 2023, Real Madrid signed Jude Bellingham, who was given the number #5 jersey, previously used by Zinedine Zidane. Real also signed Arda Güler and Fran García. Meanwhile, Vinícius Júnior was given the number #7 jersey, previously used by Raúl and Cristiano Ronaldo; while Rodrygo was given the number #11 jersey, previously used by Gareth Bale. Karim Benzema left the club, while Toni Kroos would later announce that he would retire from football after this season. The 2023-24 season would prove to be another highly successful season for Los Blancos. First, Real Madrid lifted the Spanish Super Cup against Barcelona 4–1, taking revenge of the previous year's 3–0 defeat. Then, Real Madrid lifted the La Liga with relative ease, reaching 95 points, the second-best winning campaign by Real Madrid in La Liga history after the 2011–12 100 points season. In the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League, Real Madrid knocked out RB Leipzig in the Round of 16, then defending champions Manchester City in penalties. In the semifinals, Real Madrid faced Bayern Munich again. The first match was a 2–2 draw, while the second match in the Bernabéu was marked by a double by Joselu in the last few minutes of the game, with Bayern Munich suffering a historic comeback after leading 1–0. Real Madrid faced Borussia Dortmund in the final, and won 2–0, with Dani Carvajal being the man of the match and scoring with a header after a Toni Kroos corner, and Vinícius Júnior once again scoring in a UCL final. Real Madrid won their 15th Champions League without losing a single match during the campaign. Following the conclusion of the 2023–24 season, Real Madrid announced that striker Kylian Mbappé would be joining the club on a free transfer from Paris Saint-Germain in July 2024, concluding one of the most highly anticipated transfer sagas in modern history.[182] On 18 December 2024, Real Madrid clinched their second trophy of the season, uplifting the inaugural 2024 FIFA Intercontinental Cup by beating Pachuca 3-0.[183] The first crest had a simple design consisting of a decorative interlacing of the three initials of the club, \"MCF\" for Madrid Club de Fútbol, in dark blue on a white shirt. The first change in the crest occurred in 1908 when the letters adopted a more streamlined form and appeared inside a circle.[184] The next change in the configuration of the crest did not occur until the presidency of Pedro Parages in 1920. At that time, King Alfonso XIII granted the club his royal patronage which came in the form of the title \"Real Madrid,\" meaning \"Royal.\"[185] Thus, Alfonso's crown was added to the crest and the club styled itself Real Madrid Club de Fútbol.[184] With the dissolution of the monarchy in 1931, all royal symbols (the crown on the crest and the title of Real) were eliminated. The crown was replaced by the dark mulberry band of the Region of Castile.[49] In 1941, two years after Nationalist victory in the Civil War, the Francoist regime restored the crest's \"Real Corona\", or \"Royal Crown\", while the mulberry stripe of Castile was retained as well.[186][57] In addition, the whole crest was made full color, with gold being the most prominent, and the club went back to its honorific name Real Madrid Club de Fútbol.[184] The most recent modification to the crest occurred in 2001 when the club wanted to better situate itself for the 21st century and further standardize its crest. One of the modifications made was changing the mulberry stripe to a more bluish shade.[184] Real Madrid has maintained the white shirt for its home kit throughout the history of the club. There was, however, one season that the shirt and shorts were not both white. It was an initiative undertaken by Juan Padrós in honour of an English team Corinthian, which he had met on one of his trips, one of the most famous teams at the time known for its elegance and sportsmanship.[44] It was decided that Real Madrid would wear black shorts in an attempt to replicate the English team, which had also inspired Madrid's original white kit, but the initiative lasted just one year. After being eliminated from the cup by Barcelona with a 1–5 defeat in Madrid and a 2–0 defeat in Catalonia, President Parages decided to return to an all-white kit, claiming that the other kit brought bad luck.[note 3] By the early 1940s, the manager changed the kit again by adding buttons to the shirt and the club's crest on the left breast, which has remained ever since. On 23 November 1947, in a game against Atlético Madrid at the Metropolitano Stadium, Real Madrid became the first Spanish team to wear numbered shirts.[57] English club Leeds United permanently switched their blue shirt for a white one in the 1960s, to emulate the dominant Real Madrid of the era.[187] Real's traditional away colours are all blue or all purple. Since the advent of the replica kit market, the club has also released various other one colour designs, including red, green, orange and black. The club's kit is manufactured by Adidas, whose contract extends from 1998.[188][189] Real Madrid's first shirt sponsor, Zanussi, agreed for the 1982–83, 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons. Following that, the club was sponsored by Parmalat and Otaysa before a long-term deal was signed with Teka in 1992.[190][191] In 2001, Real Madrid ended their contract with Teka and for one season and used the Realmadrid.com logo to promote the club's website. Then, in 2002, a deal was signed with Siemens and in 2006, the BenQ Siemens logo appeared on the club's shirt.[192] Real Madrid's shirt sponsor from 2007 until 2013 was bwin.com following the economic problems of BenQ Siemens.[193][194] Fly Emirates became their shirt sponsor in 2013, and in 2017 the club renewed the sponsorship with the airliner, signing a deal until 2022 worth €70 million per year.[195] In 2022, the agreement was again extended, until 2026.[196] In 2015, Madrid signed a new ten-year contract with Adidas, believed to be worth a total of £850 million (€1 billion), with the club earning £59 million (€64 million) per season. The contract includes a clause sanctioning penalty or agreement termination anytime, if Real Madrid fails to qualify for the European competitions or is relegated from La Liga.[197] Note: early termination clauses can be activated at any time depending on the team's performance. After moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912, which remained its home stadium for 11 years.[46] After this period, the club moved for one year to the Campo de Ciudad Lineal, a small ground with a capacity of 8,000 spectators. After that, Real Madrid started playing its home matches at the Estadio Chamartín, which was inaugurated on 17 May 1923 with a match against Newcastle United.[203] In this stadium, which hosted 22,500 spectators, Real Madrid celebrated its first Spanish league title.[48] Following his election in 1943, president Santiago Bernabéu decided that the Chamartín was not big enough for the ambitions of the club, and thus a new stadium was built and inaugurated on 14 December 1947.[57][204] Initially knows as Nuevo Chamartín, the stadium was renamed in honour of Bernabéu in 1955 and continues to bear his name to this day.[58] The first match at the Bernabéu was played between Madrid and the Portuguese club Belenenses, with Los Blancos winning 3–1 and Sabino Barinaga scoring the first goal.[57] The capacity has changed frequently, peaking at 120,000 after a 1953 expansion.[205] Since then, there have been a number of reductions due to modernizations (the last standing areas were removed in 1998–99 in response to UEFA regulations which had forbidden standing at matches in European competitions), countered to some extent by expansions.[205] The current capacity is 81,044 spectators. Real Madrid has the fourth-highest average attendance in Europe, behind Borussia Dortmund, Barcelona and Manchester United.[206][207][208][209] The Bernabéu has hosted the 1964 UEFA European Championship final, the 1982 FIFA World Cup final, and the 1957, 1969, 1980 and 2010 European Cup/Champions League finals.[210] The stadium has its own namesake Madrid Metro station along the 10 line.[211] On 14 November 2007, the Bernabéu was upgraded to Elite Football Stadium status by UEFA.[212] On 9 May 2006, the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium, named after club legend Alfredo Di Stéfano, was inaugurated in the Real Madrid City, where Real Madrid usually trains. The inaugural match was played between Real Madrid and Reims, a rematch of the 1956 European Cup final. Real Madrid 6–1, with goals from Sergio Ramos, Antonio Cassano (2), Roberto Soldado (2) and José Manuel Jurado. The venue is now part of the Ciudad Real Madrid, the club's training facility located outside Madrid, in Valdebebas. The stadium's capacity is 5,000 people, and it is Real Madrid Castilla's home ground.[213] For the latter part of the 2019–20 season and throughout the 2020–21 season, the stadium hosted the first team's home games due to a combination of the COVID-19 pandemic-triggered restrictions and an extensive renovation of the Santiago Bernabéu.[214][165] The latest renovation of the Santiago Bernabéu is set to increase the capacity by approximately 4,000 with the addition of an extra tier, bringing it to nearly 85,000.[215][216] Furthermore, the height will also be increased by ten metres and a retractable roof, a retractable pitch and a 360-degree screen will be installed.[217][218] The works have started in 2019, and the renovated stadium was initially planned to be unveiled in 2022; however, the COVID-19 pandemic and Russian invasion of Ukraine caused significant disruption to supply chains, prompting the club to postpone the stadium's inauguration to 2023.[219][220] Raúl holds the record for most appearances with Real Madrid, with 741 appearances from 1994 to 2010. Iker Casillas comes second with 725 appearances, followed by Manuel Sanchis Jr., having played 710 times.[221] The record for a goalkeeper is held by Iker Casillas, with 725 appearances. With 63 goals, Cristiano Ronaldo has scored the most international goals while playing for the club. Meanwhile, Sergio Ramos has accumulated the most caps while playing for the club, with 176. Cristiano Ronaldo (2009–2018) is Real Madrid's all-time top goalscorer, with 450 goals in 438 matches.[222][223] Six other players have also scored over 200 goals for Real: Alfredo Di Stéfano (1953–1964), Santillana (1971–1988), Ferenc Puskás (1958–1966), Hugo Sánchez (1985–1992), Karim Benzema (2009–2023) and the previous goalscoring record-holder Raúl (1994–2010). Cristiano Ronaldo also holds the record for the most league goals scored in one season (48 in 2014–15), alongside being Real's top goalscorer of all time in La Liga history with 311 goals. Di Stéfano's 49 goals in 58 matches was for decades the all-time highest tally in the European Cup, until it was surpassed by Raúl in 2005, and is now held by Cristiano Ronaldo with 105 goals for Madrid and 140 overall. The fastest goal in the history of the club (13 seconds) was scored by the Chilean Iván Zamorano on 3 September 1994 during a league match against Sevilla.[224] Officially, the highest home attendance figure for a Real Madrid match is 129,690, which was for a European Cup match in 1956 against Milan. The current official capacity of the Santiago Bernabéu is 80,000.[225] Real has also set records in Spanish football, most notably the most domestic titles (36 as of 2023–24) and the most seasons won in a row (five, during 1960–65 and 1985–90).[1] With 121 matches (from 17 February 1957 to 7 March 1965), the club holds the record for longest unbeaten run at home in La Liga.[226] The club also holds the record for winning the European Cup/UEFA Champions League fifteen times[227] and for the most semi-finals appearances (33). As of June 2024, Cristiano Ronaldo is the all-time top scorer in the UEFA Champions League, with 140 (141 including qualifiers) goals in total, 105 while playing for Real Madrid. The team has the record number of consecutive participations in the European Cup (before it became the Champions League) with 15, from 1955–56 to 1969–70.[228] Among the club's on-field records is a 22-game winning streak in all competitions during the 2014–15 season, a Spanish record. In September 2017, the club equalled the record of the Brazilian club Santos, starring Pelé, by scoring in their 73rd consecutive game, before Bayern Munich breaks the record in 2021.[229] In June 2009, the club broke its own record for the highest transfer fee ever paid in the history of football after purchasing Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo for €94 million (£80 million).[230][231] The fee of €77.5 million (100 billion lire) for Zinedine Zidane's transfer from Juventus to Real Madrid in 2001 was the previous highest transfer fee ever paid. This record (in pounds sterling) had been broken previously in June 2009, for a few days, when Real Madrid agreed to buy Kaká from Milan for €67 million (£65 million). The transfer of Tottenham Hotspur's Gareth Bale in 2013 was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer fee approximated at around €100 million.[111] In January 2016, documents pertaining to Bale's transfer were leaked which confirmed a world record transfer fee of €100,759,418.[232] Real Madrid equalled their record signing in 2019, when the club signed Eden Hazard from Chelsea for a reported €115 million.[233] The club's record sale occurred on 10 July 2018, when Juventus signed Cristiano Ronaldo for €117 million.[234] During most home matches, the majority of the seats in the stadium are occupied by season-ticket holders, of which the figure is capped at 65,000.[235] To become a season ticket holder one must first be a socio, or club member. In addition to members, the club has more than 1,800 peñas (official, club-affiliated supporters' groups) in Spain and around the world. Real Madrid has the second highest average all-time attendance in Spanish football and regularly attracts over 74,000 fans to the Bernabéu. One of the best supported teams globally, Real Madrid was the first sports team (and first brand) to reach 100 million fans on Facebook in April 2017.[236][237] Real Madrid's hardcore supporters are the so-called Ultras Sur supporters, or simply Ultras. They are known for their extreme right-wing politics, akin to Barcelona's hardcore supporters group Boixos Nois. The Ultras Surs have developed an alliance with other right wing groups, most notably Lazio Irriducibili fans, and have also developed an alliance with left-wing groups. On several occasions, they have racially abused opposing players, and have been investigated by UEFA for doing so.[238][239] Florentino Pérez took it upon himself to ban the Ultras from the Bernabéu and assign their seats to the general public. This decision was controversial with some of the Bernabéu faithful, however, as the lively atmosphere of games would suffer as a result.[240][241] The Ultras have since held protests outside the Bernabéu and have demanded to be reinstated and allowed to enter the grounds.[242] Questioned over Pope Francis' adherence to 2014 FIFA Club World Cup Final opponents San Lorenzo, Madrid captain Sergio Ramos stated: \"In the semi-finals we noticed the love from supporters in Marrakesh and it seemed like we were playing at home. That sums up the greatness of this team. Madrid is God's team and the team of the world\".[243] Among the club's famous supporters is golfer Sergio García, who was invited to take the honorary kickoff for El Clásico at the Bernabeu wearing his green jacket from winning the 2017 Masters.[244] There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Real Madrid and Barcelona is known as \"The Classic\" (El Clásico). From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Castile and Catalonia, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between the Castilians and Catalans, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.[245] Over the years, the record for Real Madrid and Barcelona is 105 victories for Madrid, 101 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws as at December 2024.[246] As early as the 1930s, Barcelona \"had developed a reputation as a symbol of Catalan identity, opposed to the centralising tendencies of Madrid\".[248][249] During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera and especially Francisco Franco, all regional languages and identities in Spain were frowned upon and restrained. As such, most citizens of Barcelona were in strong opposition to Franco's regime. In that period, Barcelona gained their motto Més que un club (English: More than a club) because of its alleged connection to Catalan nationalist as well as to progressive beliefs.[250] There is an ongoing controversy as to what extent Franco's rule (1939–75) influenced the activities and on-pitch results of both Barcelona and Real Madrid. Fans of both clubs tend to exaggerate the myths favouring their narratives. Most historians agree that Franco did not have a preferred football team, but his Spanish nationalist beliefs led him to associate himself with the establishment teams, such as Atlético Aviación and Madrid FC (that recovered its \"royal\" name after the fall of the Republic and again became Real Madrid). On the other hand, he also wanted the renamed Barcelona succeed as \"Spanish team\", rather than a Catalan one. During the early years of Franco's rule, Real Madrid were not particularly successful, winning two Copa del Generalísimo titles and a Copa Eva Duarte; Barcelona claimed three league titles, one Copa del Generalísimo and one Copa Eva Duarte. During that period, Atlético Aviación were believed to be the preferred team over Real Madrid. The most contested stories of the period include Real Madrid's 11–1 home win against Barcelona in the Copa del Generalísimo, where the Catalan team alleged intimidation, and the controversial transfer of Alfredo Di Stéfano to Real Madrid, despite his agreement with Barcelona. The latter transfer was part of Real Madrid chairman Santiago Bernabéu's \"revolution\" that ushered in the era of unprecedented dominance. Bernabéu, himself a veteran of the Civil War who fought for Franco's forces, saw Real Madrid on top, not only of Spanish, but also European football, helping create the European Cup, the first true competition for Europe's best club sides. His vision was fulfilled when Real Madrid not only started winning consecutive league titles, but also swept the first five editions of the European Cup in the 1950s.[251] These events had a profound impact on Spanish football and influenced Franco's attitude. According to historians, during this time he realized the importance of Real Madrid for his regime's international image, and the club became his preferred team until his death. Fernando Maria Castiella, who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs under Franco from 1957 until 1969, noted that \"[Real Madrid] is the best embassy we have ever had\". Franco died in 1975, and the Spanish transition to democracy soon followed. Under his rule, Real Madrid had won 14 league titles, six Copa del Generalísimo titles, one Copa Eva Duarte, six European Cups, two Latin Cups and one Intercontinental Cup. In the same period, Barcelona had won eight league titles, nine Copa del Generalísimo titles, three Copa Eva Duarte titles, three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups and two Latin Cups.[252][186] The rivalry was intensified during the 1950s when the clubs disputed the signing of Alfredo Di Stéfano. Di Stéfano had impressed both Barcelona and Real Madrid while playing for Los Millonarios in Bogotá, Colombia, during a players' strike in his native Argentina. Soon after Millonarios' return to Colombia, Barcelona directors visited Buenos Aires and agreed with River Plate, the last FIFA-affiliated team to have held Di Stéfano's rights, for his transfer in 1954 for the equivalent of 150 million Italian lira (according to other sources 200,000 dollars). This started a battle between the two Spanish rivals for his rights. FIFA appointed Armando Muñoz Calero, former president of the Spanish Football Federation as mediator. Calero decided to let Di Stéfano play the 1953–54 and 1955–56 seasons in Madrid, and the 1954–55 and 1956–57 seasons in Barcelona. The agreement was approved by the Football Association and their respective clubs. Although the Catalans agreed, the decision created various discontent among the Blaugrana members and the president was forced to resign in September 1953. Barcelona sold Madrid their half-share, and Di Stéfano moved to Los Blancos, signing a four-year contract. Real paid 5.5 million Spanish pesetas for the transfer, plus a 1.3 million bonus for the purchase, an annual fee to be paid to the Millonarios, and a 16,000 salary for Di Stéfano with a bonus double that of his teammates, for a total of 40% of the annual revenue of the Madrid club.[253] Di Stéfano became integral in the subsequent success achieved by Real Madrid, scoring twice in his first game against Barcelona. With him, Madrid won the first five editions of the European Cup.[254] The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when Real Madrid and Barcelona met twice in the European Cup, with Madrid triumphing en route to their fifth consecutive title in 1959–60 and Barcelona prevailing en route to losing the final in 1960–61. Ahead of the 1973–74 season, Johan Cruyff arrived to Barcelona for a world record £920,000 from Ajax.[255] Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Francisco Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son \"Jordi\", after the local Catalan Saint George.[256] In 2002, the European encounter between the clubs was dubbed the \"Match of The Century\" by Spanish media, and Madrid's win was watched by more than 500 million people around the world.[257] A fixture known for its intensity and indiscipline, it has also featured memorable goal celebrations from both teams, often involving mocking the opposition.[258] In October 1999, Real Madrid forward Raúl silenced 100,000 Barcelona fans at the Camp Nou when he scored before he celebrated by putting a finger to his lips as if telling the crowd to be quiet.[258][259] In 2009, Barcelona captain Carles Puyol kissed his Catalan armband in front of Madrid fans at the Bernabéu.[258] Cristiano Ronaldo twice gestured to the hostile crowd to \"calm down\" after scoring against Barcelona at the Camp Nou in 2012 and 2016.[258] In April 2017, Messi celebrated his 93rd-minute winner for Barcelona against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu by taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans – with his name and number facing them.[258] Later that year, in August, Ronaldo was subbed on in the first leg of the Supercopa de España, proceeded to score in the 80th minute and took his shirt off before holding it up to Barça's fans with his name and number facing them.[260] The club's nearest neighbour is Atlético Madrid, a rivalry being shared between fans of both football teams. Although Atlético was founded by three Basque students in 1903, it was joined in 1904 by dissident members of \"Madrid FC\". The two teams met for the first time on 2 December 1906 in the regional championship, with Real Madrid winning 2–1. Their first league meeting came on 21 February 1929 in matchday three of the first league championship at the former Chamartín. It was the first official derby of the new tournament, and Real won 2–1.[48] After the Civil War, during the early Francoist period, Atlético became associated with the military air force (and thus renamed Atlético Aviación), although the alleged preference of the regime for the club is subject to discussion. In any case, during this period Atlético became the most successful club in Spain, reducing the historical gap between the two clubs, until the regime preference shifted towards Real Madrid in the 1950s, as Franco sought to make political capital out of Real Madrid's multiple European Cup titles at a time when Spain was internationally isolated; one minister said, \"Real Madrid are the best ambassadors we've ever had.\"[186] Thus, Atlético fans regularly chanted that Real were \"El equipo del gobierno, la vergüenza del país\" – \"The team of the government, the shame of the country\" – and allegedly adopted a more left-wing slant (tempered by the rise of ultras culture and Rayo Vallecano's presence as the \"true\" leftist club in Madrid).[261][262] The rivalry first gained international attention in 1959 during the European Cup when the two clubs met in the semi-finals. Real won the first leg 2–1 at the Santiago Bernabéu, while Atlético won 1–0 at the Metropolitano. The tie went to a replay, which Real won 2–1. Atlético, however, gained some revenge when, led by former Real Madrid coach José Villalonga, it defeated its city rivals in two successive Copa del Generalísimo finals in 1960 and 1961.[263] In the 1970s, Atlético again took the lead as the most successful Spanish club of the decade, which prompted the Real Madrid fanbase to look down on Atlético calling them and their supporters \"Indios\" (Indians, a reference to the Latin American players signed by the Red-and-whites).[264] By then, Real Madrid did not want to sign non-Caucasian players (president Santiago Bernabéu even stated, when he decided not to sign Portuguese star Eusebio at the end of the 1960s, \"Mientras yo viva, aquí no jugará ningún negro ni un blanco con bigote\" (\"As long as I live, no black or white with a mustache will play here\").[265] Atlético's supporters accepted the new \"Indian\" nickname joyfully and have been using it until today. The Santiago Bernabéu, Real Madrid's stadium, is alongside banks and businesses on the upper class Paseo de la Castellana street, while the Vicente Calderón (the stadium that Atlético Madrid used until the 2016–17 season) could be found near a brewery, alongside the Manzanares River and a motorway. Real draw greater support all across the region because of their historically greater resources and success, while Atlético have a relatively working class fan base mainly from the south of the city, with some fans also scattered throughout the city.[266][267] In fact, the Atlético crest includes the Coat of arms of Madrid, whereas Real crest has no such a reference to the city (instead, it includes a reference to the broader Castile region). Between 1961 and 1989, when Real dominated La Liga, only Atlético offered it any serious challenge, winning league titles in 1966, 1970, 1973 and 1977. In 1965, Atlético became the first team to beat Real at the Bernabéu in eight years. Real Madrid's record against Atlético in more recent times has been favourable.[268] A high point came in the 2002–03 season, when Real clinched the La Liga title after a 4–0 victory at the Vicente Calderón. Atlético's first win over its city rivals since 1999 came in the Copa del Rey final in May 2013. In 2013–14, Real and Atlético were finalists of the UEFA Champions League, the first final which hosted two clubs from the same city. Real Madrid triumphed with a 4–1 comeback victory in extra time.[269] On 7 February 2015, Real suffered their first defeat in 14 years at the Vicente Calderón, a 4–0 loss.[270] On 28 May 2016, Real and Atlético again met for the Champions League title, which resulted in a win for Real after a penalty shootout at San Siro.[271] A further minor rivalry exists between Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao. This is known as El Viejo Clásico (the old classic),[272] so named as the two clubs were dominant in the first half of the 20th century, meeting in nine Copa del Rey finals including the first in 1903.[273][274] Until 10 December 2011, this fixture was the most played in the history of Spanish football, when it was surpassed by El Clásico.[275] Athletic Bilbao, who operate a policy of only using local players,[276] have long since ceased to be a competitive rival to clubs such as Real Madrid who scour the globe for the best talent; the Lions won only two of the 26 matches between the teams from 2005–06 to 2016–17.[272][277][278] However, the matches remain keenly fought due to their historical and cultural significance, with some parallels to the political aspect of the Barcelona/Catalonia rivalry as Athletic are the largest club in the Basque region.[279][262][280] Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are two of the most successful clubs in the UEFA Champions League/European Cup competition, with Real winning 15 times and Bayern winning six times.[281][282] Although they have never met in a final, Real Madrid versus Bayern is the match that has historically been played most often in the Champions League/European Cup with 26 matches (twelve wins for Madrid, eleven wins for Bayern, with three draws),[283] with several controversial incidents occurring due to the great importance of most of their meetings.[284][285][286] Real Madrid supporters often refer to Bayern as the \"Bestia negra\" (\"Black Beast\"). During the 2010s, the two teams met in the 2011–12 Champions League semi-finals, which ended 3–3 on aggregate (Bayern won 3–1 on penalties after extra time, but lost the final at their own stadium by the same method), then at the same stage in the 2013–14 edition with Real Madrid winning 5–0 on aggregate,[287] and again in 2017–18 with the Spanish club progressing 4–3;[288] both times they went on to win the competition. Another match that is often played in the European Cup/Champions League is Real Madrid vs Juventus, the most decorated Italian club. They have played each other in 21 matches and have an almost perfectly balanced record (nine wins for Juventus, ten wins for Real Madrid and two draws), as well as nearly the same goal difference (Madrid ahead 26 to 25).[289][290][291] Their first meeting was in the quarter-finals of the 1961–62 European Cup, which Real Madrid won 3–1 in a replay held in Paris.[290] At the quarter-final stage in 1995–96, Juventus prevailed 2–1 over the two legs and went on to lift the trophy.[290] In the 1998 UEFA Champions League Final between the teams in Amsterdam, Real Madrid won 1–0.[290][292] They met again in the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, when both clubs were in their respective 'golden eras'; Juventus won 4–3 on aggregate.[290] By that time, star midfielder Zinedine Zidane, who played for the Bianconeri in the 1998 final, had moved from Turin to Madrid in a world record €77 million deal.[293] The teams met again in the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League group stage, with Madrid winning 2–1 at home and drawing 2–2 away en route to their tenth title. In the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, former Real Madrid player Álvaro Morata scored one goal in each leg to take Juventus to the final, winning 3–2 on aggregate, while Cristiano Ronaldo scored both goals for Madrid.[290] They faced off again in the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final in Cardiff, with Ronaldo scoring twice as Real Madrid won 4–1.[290][294][295] The latest Champions League meeting was in the 2017–18 quarter-finals, which Real Madrid won 4–3 on aggregate; the tie ended in dramatic and controversial fashion, with a debatable penalty awarded to Real Madrid in the last minute of the second leg after Juventus built a 3–0 lead at the Bernabeu to pull level in the tie following a defeat at the Allianz Stadium by the same scoreline.[296][297] Cristiano Ronaldo scored three goals over the two matches including the decisive penalty and a spectacular overhead kick,[298] and having won the Champions League with Madrid for a fourth time,[299] he transferred to Juventus a few months later for a €117 million fee.[300] It was under Florentino Pérez's first presidency (2000–2006) that Real Madrid started its ambition of becoming the world's richest professional football club.[301] The club ceded part of its training grounds to the city of Madrid in 2001, and sold the rest to four corporations: Repsol YPF, Mutua Automovilística de Madrid, Sacyr Vallehermoso and OHL. The sale eradicated the club's debts, paving the way for it to buy the world's most expensive players, such as Zinedine Zidane, Luís Figo, Ronaldo and David Beckham. The city had previously rezoned the training grounds for development, a move which in turn increased their value, and then bought the site.[79] The European Commission started an investigation into whether the city overpaid for the property, to be considered a form of state subsidy.[302] The sale of the training ground for office buildings cleared Real Madrid's debts of €270 million and enabled the club to embark upon an unprecedented spending spree which brought big-name players to the club. In addition, profit from the sale was spent on a state-of-the-art training complex on the city's outskirts.[303] Although Pérez's policy resulted in increased financial success from the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, especially in Asia, it came under increasing criticism for being too focused on marketing the Real Madrid brand and not enough on the performances of the team.[82] By September 2007, Real Madrid was considered the most valuable football brand in Europe by BBDO. In 2008, it was ranked the second-most valuable club in world football, at €951 million (£640 million / $1.285 billion),[304] only beaten by Manchester United, which was valued at €1.333 billion (£900 million).[305] In 2010, Real Madrid had the highest turnover in football worldwide.[306] In September 2009, Real Madrid's management announced plans to open the club's own dedicated theme park by 2013.[307] A study at Harvard University concluded that Real Madrid \"is one of the 20 most important brand names and the only one in which its executives, the players, are well-known. We have some spectacular figures in regard to worldwide support of the club. There are an estimated 287 million people worldwide who follow Real Madrid.\"[308] In 2010, Forbes evaluated Real Madrid's worth to be around €992 million (US$1.323 billion), ranking them second only to Manchester United, based on figures from the 2008–09 season.[309][310] According to Deloitte, Real Madrid had a recorded revenue of €401 million in the same period, ranking first.[311] Along with Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao and Osasuna, Real Madrid is organised as a registered association. This means that the club is owned by its supporters, who elect the president. The president cannot invest his own money,[312] and the club can only spend what it earns, which is mainly derived through sponsorships, commercial partnerships, merchandise sales, television rights, prize money and ticket sales. Unlike a limited company, it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only a membership.[313] The members of Real Madrid, called \"socios\", form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club.[314] As of 2010, the club had 60,000 socios.[315] At the end of the 2009–10 season, the club's board of directors stated that Real Madrid had a net debt of €244.6 million, €82.1 million lower than the previous fiscal year. Real Madrid announced that it had a net debt of €170 million after the 2010–11 season. From 2007 to 2011, the club made a net profit of €190 million.[316][317] During the 2009–10 season, Real Madrid made €150 million through ticket sales, the most of any club in top-flight football.[316] Real Madrid has the highest number of shirt sales per season, around 1.5 million.[316] For the 2010–11 season, Madrid's wage bill totalled €169 million, which was second-highest in Europe behind Barcelona;[318] furthermore, its wage bill to turnover ratio was the best in Europe at 43 percent, ahead of Manchester United and Arsenal at 46 percent and 50 percent, respectively. In 2013, Forbes listed the club as the world's most valuable sports team, worth $3.3 billion.[319] Real Madrid was valued at €3.47 billion ($4.1 billion) in 2018, and in the 2016–17 season it was the second highest-earning football club in the world, with an annual revenue of €674.6 million.[320] In November 2018, the average first-team pay at Madrid was £8.1m ($10.6m) per year, making it the second-highest paid sports team in the world after Barcelona.[321][322] In 2022, Forbes listed Real Madrid as the most valuable football club in the world, at $5.1 billion.[323] Real Madrid was the featured club in the second installment of the Goal! football movie trilogy, Goal! 2: Living the Dream... (2007). The film follows former Newcastle United star Santiago Muñez as he is first scouted and then signed by Real Madrid for the 2005–06 season. The film's creators wanted to put emphasis on the changes in Muñez's life after his move to Madrid. Production was done with the full support of UEFA, allowing the film crew to use many real life players in cameo roles. Real Madrid squad members featured in the film included Iker Casillas, Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Raúl, Sergio Ramos, Robinho, Michael Owen, Míchel Salgado, Júlio Baptista, Steve McManaman and Iván Helguera. Non-Real Madrid players to make cameo appearances included Ronaldinho, Thierry Henry, Lionel Messi, Samuel Eto'o, Andrés Iniesta, Pablo Aimar, Freddie Ljungberg, Cesc Fàbregas and Santiago Cañizares. In the film, both Florentino Pérez and Alfredo Di Stéfano presented the fictional player Muñez to the club after his signing.[324] Real, The Movie is a 2005 part feature, part documentary film that showcases the worldwide passion for Real Madrid. Produced by the club and directed by Borja Manso, it follows five sub-stories of fans from around the world and their love for the club. Along with the fictional portion of the film, it also contains real footage of the squad, during training at Ciudad Real Madrid, matches, and interviews. Although the film mentions all of the squad, it mainly focuses on galácticos such as David Beckham, Zinedine Zidane, Raúl, Luís Figo, Ronaldo, Iker Casillas and Roberto Carlos, among others. The film was originally produced in Spanish, but has been dubbed for their worldwide fanbase. The book White Storm: 100 years of Real Madrid by Phil Ball was the first English-language history of Real Madrid. Published in 2002, it talks about the most successful moments of the club during its first centenary, having been translated into various languages. In late 2011, Real Madrid released a digital music album, entitled Legends, and a remix of the club's anthem, \"Himno del Real Madrid,\" was released as the first single from the album.[325] Real Madrid TV is an encrypted digital television channel, operated by Real Madrid and specialising in the club. The channel is available in Spanish and English. It is located at Ciudad Real Madrid in Valdebebas (Madrid), Real Madrid's training centre. Hala Madrid is a magazine published quarterly for the Real Madrid club members and the Madridistas Fan Club card holders.[326] The phrase Hala Madrid, meaning \"Forward Madrid\" or \"Go Madrid\", is also the title of the club's official anthem, which is often sung by the Madridistas (the club's fans).[6] The magazine includes reports on the club's matches in the previous month, as well as information about the reserve and youth teams. Features often include interviews with players, both past and present, and the club's historic matches.[326] Real Madrid has appeared in many football-based video games, namely in the FIFA, EA Sports FC, and Pro Evolution Soccer series. A Real Madrid player has appeared on the cover of both titles a combined seven times. In 2007, Spanish game publisher Virgin Play signed a deal with the club to make officially licensed Real Madrid video games. The only one released under the deal (due to Virgin Play's liquidation in September 2009) would end up being Real Madrid: The Game, which was developed by Atomic Planet Entertainment and was published under Virgin Play's publishing division V.2 Play in May 2009 for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Windows, Wii and Nintendo DS exclusively in European territories Virgin Play released their products in. The game featured a career mode with a mixture of role-playing and simulation as well as arcade-styled Football gameplay. Spanish teams are limited to three players without EU citizenship. The squad list includes only the principal nationality of each player; several non-European players on the squad have dual citizenship with an EU country. Also, players from the ACP countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement are not counted against non-EU quotas due to the Kolpak ruling.

                "content": "Real Madrid Club de Fútbol, sometimes known as Real Madrid, is a Spanish football club from Madrid, Spain. It was started in 1902 and competes in La Liga (the Spanish top league). The \"Real\" in the club's name is Spanish for \"royal\", because it was blessed by the King of Spain in 1920. Real Madrid has won La Liga 34 times and the Copa del Rey (King's Cup) 19 times, the most out of any team in the league. It has also won the UEFA Champions League a record 15 times and the UEFA Cup twice. Real Madrid was recognised as the FIFA Club of the 20th Century on 11 December 2000, and received the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit on 20 May 2004. In June 2017, the team succeeded in becoming the first club to win the Champions League twice in a row. In 2018, Madrid made history by becoming the first club in recent history to win the Champions League three times in a row. They beat Liverpool F.C. 3–1 in the final.[6][7] Since it began, Real Madrid has since spent all of its history in La Liga, and has never been relegated down to a lower level. This shows how strong they have been just to stay in the top flight of Spanish football. In the 1940s, the club, the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium and the Ciudad Deportiva were rebuilt after the Spanish Civil War. The club became a major force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s. In the 1980s, the club had one of the best teams in Spain and Europe (known as La Quinta del Buitre). They had won two UEFA Cups, five Spanish championships in a row, one Spanish cup and three Spanish Super Cups. The club has bought and had many famous footballers, including Ronaldo, David Beckham, Zinedine Zidane, Michael Owen, Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaká and other very famous footballers. The most expensive player is Gareth Bale who was bought for 85.3 million pounds from Tottenham Hotspur of the English Premier League. The club's traditional home colours are all white. Its crest has been changed several times in attempts to modernise or re-brand. The current crest is a modified version of the one first adopted in the 1920s. Real's home stadium is the 81,044 capacity Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid, where it has played since 1947. Unlike most European football clubs, Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club since it was opened. Real is the world's most valuable club.[8] Real Madrid has won 34 La Liga titles. There is a strong rivalry between the two strongest teams in La Liga, which are Real Madrid and FC Barcelona, where the game between them is known as \"El Clásico\" (\"The Classic\"). The club's nearest neighboring club is Atlético Madrid, and matches between them are known as \"Madrid Derby\". A strong rivalry is shared between fans of both teams.

Brody was born in San Diego, California,[3][4] to Valerie Jill (née Siefman),[5] a graphic artist, and Mark Alan Brody, an attorney.[6] He has younger twin brothers, Sean and Matthew (born 1985).[7] His parents, both Jewish, are originally from Detroit. Brody had a bar mitzvah ceremony and grew up celebrating Jewish holidays.[8][9] Brody grew up in suburban San Diego, where he attended Wangenheim Middle School and Scripps Ranch High School and received \"poor grades\".[10] He spent much of his time surfing,[11] admitting that he \"pretty much lived at the beach\".[10] Brody attended community college at MiraCosta College for one year, dropping out at the age of 19; he then moved to Hollywood to become an actor.[2] After a year of training and auditioning, Brody landed the role of Barry Williams in the television film Growing Up Brady (2000) and appeared in the Canadian comedy series The Sausage Factory.

That year, he was cast in his breakout role as Seth Cohen on the teen drama series The O.C., where he reportedly improvised some of the character's comedic dialogue.[11] The role turned him into a teen idol, with the character described by the Los Angeles Times as \"TV's sexiest geek\"[11] and by Time as having \"redefined\" the screen persona of \"unapologetic\" nerdiness.[2] Brody was the first male on the cover of Elle Girl.[2][13] In 2005, Brody had a supporting role in the film Mr. & Mrs. Smith, and played a Hollywood studio assistant in the film adaptation of Thank You for Smoking (2006).[11] His next film role was in the romantic comedy In the Land of Women (2007), as a writer who returns to his mother's Michigan hometown to take care of his sick grandmother. He did not have to audition for the part, but was almost unable to appear in the film because of scheduling conflicts with the second season of The O.C.; the film's director pushed filming back eight months because he wanted Brody to star.[11][13] The O.C. ended its run in 2007 after four seasons. Brody had said that he was \"not unhappy\" with the show's cancellation,[13] and that although he was \"fortunate\" to be on a successful series, he was also glad to \"not be on it for 10 years\".[2] After the end of The O.C.'s run, Brody turned to a full-time film career.[11] In 2007, he appeared in supporting roles in the films Smiley Face and The Ten.[11] In 2009, he starred in Boaz Yakin's drama Death in Love and in Diablo Cody's horror film Jennifer's Body.

                "title": "Liverpool - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Liverpool is a cathedral and port city and metropolitan borough in Merseyside, England, which had a population of 496,770 in 2022.[3] It is on the eastern side of the Mersey Estuary, near the Irish Sea, 178 miles (286 km) northwest of London. Liverpool is the fifth largest city in the United Kingdom and the administrative headquarters of the Liverpool City Region, a combined authority area with a population of over 1.5 million.[5] Established as a borough in Lancashire in 1207, Liverpool became significant in the late 17th century when the Port of Liverpool was heavily involved in the Atlantic slave trade. The port also imported cotton for the Lancashire textile mills, and became a major departure point for English and Irish emigrants to North America. Liverpool rose to global economic importance at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century and was home to the first intercity railway, the first non-combustible warehouse system (the Royal Albert Dock), and a pioneering elevated electrical railway; it was granted city status in 1880 and was moved from Lancashire to the newly created county of Merseyside in 1974. It entered a period of decline in the mid-20th century, but has experienced regeneration since the European Union selected it as the European Capital of Culture in 2008,[a] which was reported to have generated over £800 million for the local economy within a year.[6][7] The economy of Liverpool is diversified and encompasses tourism, culture, maritime, hospitality, healthcare, life sciences, advanced manufacturing, creative, and digital sectors.[8][9][10] The city is home to the UK's second highest number of art galleries, national museums, listed buildings, and parks and open spaces, with only London having more.[11] It is often used as a filming location due to its architecture, and was the fifth most visited UK city by foreign tourists in 2022.[12] It has produced numerous musicians, most notably the Beatles, and artists from the city have had more UK No. 1 hit singles than anywhere else.[13] It has also produced academics, actors, artists, comedians, filmmakers, poets, scientists, sportspeople, and writers. It is the home of Premier League football teams Everton and Liverpool. The world's oldest still-operating mainline train station, Liverpool Lime Street, is in the city centre; it is also served by the underground Merseyrail network. The city's port was the fourth largest in the UK in 2023, with numerous shipping and freight lines having headquarters and offices there.[14] Residents of Liverpool are often called \"Scousers\" in reference to scouse, a local stew made popular by sailors in the city, while \"Scouse\" is also the most common name given to the local accent. The city's cultural and ethnic diversity is a result of attracting immigrants, especially from Ireland, Scandinavia, and Wales; it is also the home of a large black and Chinese community, and the first mosque in England.[15] The name comes from the Old English lifer, meaning thick or muddy water, and pōl, meaning a pool or creek, and is first recorded around 1190 as Liuerpul.[16][17] According to the Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names, \"The original reference was to a pool or tidal creek now filled up into which two streams drained\".[18] The place appearing as Leyrpole, in a legal record of 1418, may also refer to Liverpool.[19] Other origins of the name have been suggested, including \"elverpool\", a reference to the large number of eels in the Mersey.[20] The adjective \"Liverpudlian\" was first recorded in 1833.[17] Although the Old English origin of the name Liverpool is beyond dispute, claims are sometimes made that the name Liverpool is of Welsh origin, but these are without foundation. The Welsh name for Liverpool is Lerpwl, from a former English local form Leerpool. This is a reduction of the form \"Leverpool\" with the loss of the intervocalic [v] (seen in other English names and words e.g. Daventry (Northamptonshire) > Danetry, never-do-well > ne’er-do-well). In the 19th century, some Welsh publications used the name \"Lle'r Pwll\" (\"(the) place (of) the pool\"), a reinterpretation of Lerpwl, probably in the belief that \"Lle'r Pwll\" was the original form. Another name, which is widely known even today, is Llynlleifiad, again a 19th-century coining. \"Llyn\" is pool, but \"lleifiad\" has no obvious meaning. G. Melville Richards (1910–1973), a pioneer of scientific toponymy in Wales, in \"Place Names of North Wales\",[21] does not attempt to explain it beyond noting that \"lleifiad\" is used as a Welsh equivalent of \"Liver\". A derivative form of a learned borrowing into Welsh (*llaf) of Latin lāma (slough, bog, fen) to give \"lleifiad\" is possible, but unproven. In the Middle Ages, Liverpool existed firstly as farmland within the West Derby Hundred[22] before growing in to a small town of farmers, fishermen and tradesmen and tactical army base for King John of England. The town was planned with its own castle, although due to outbreaks of disease and its subordinance to the nearby Roman port of Chester, the town's growth and prosperity stagnated until the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Substantial growth took place in the mid-late 18th century when the town became the most heavily involved European port in the Atlantic slave trade.[23] King John's letters patent of 1207 announced the foundation of the borough of Liverpool (then spelt as Liuerpul). There is no evidence that the place had previously been a centre of any trade. The creation of the borough was probably due to King John deciding it would be a convenient place to embark men and supplies for his Irish campaigns, in particular John's Irish campaign of 1209.[24][25] The original street plan of Liverpool is said to have been designed by King John near the same time it was granted a royal charter, making it a borough. The original seven streets were laid out in the shape of a double cross: Bank Street (now Water Street), Castle Street, Chapel Street, Dale Street, Juggler Street (now High Street), Moor Street (now Tithebarn Street) and Whiteacre Street (now Old Hall Street).[25] Liverpool Castle was built before 1235, it survived until it was demolished in the 1720s.[26] By the middle of the 16th century, the population was still around 600, although this was likely to have fallen from an earlier peak of 1000 people due to slow trade and the effects of the plague.[27][28][29] In the 17th century, there was slow progress in trade and population growth. Battles for control of the town were waged during the English Civil War, including a brief siege in 1644.[30] In 1699, the same year as its first recorded slave ship, Liverpool Merchant, set sail for Africa,[31] Liverpool was made a parish by Act of Parliament. But arguably, the legislation of 1695 that reformed the Liverpool council was of more significance to its subsequent development.[32] Since Roman times nearby Chester on the River Dee had been the region's principal port on the Irish Sea. However, as the Dee began to silt up, maritime trade from Chester became increasingly difficult and shifted towards Liverpool on the neighbouring River Mersey. The first of the Liverpool docks was constructed in 1715, and the system of docks gradually grew into a large interconnected system.[33] As trade from the West Indies, including sugar, surpassed that of Ireland and Europe, and as the River Dee continued to silt up, Liverpool began to grow with increasing rapidity. The first commercial wet dock was built in Liverpool in 1715.[34][35] Substantial profits from the slave trade and tobacco helped the town to prosper and rapidly grow, although several prominent local men, including William Rathbone, William Roscoe and Edward Rushton, were at the forefront of the local abolitionist movement.[36] The 19th century saw Liverpool rise to global economic importance. Pioneering, world first, technology and civic facilities launched in the city to serve the accelerating population which was fuelled by an influx of ethnic and religious communities from all around the world. By the start of the 19th century, a large volume of trade was passing through Liverpool, and the construction of major buildings reflected this wealth. In 1830, Liverpool and Manchester became the first cities to have an intercity rail link, through the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The population continued to rise rapidly, especially during the 1840s when Irish migrants began arriving by the hundreds of thousands as a result of the Great Famine. While many Irish settled during this time in the city, a large percentage also emigrated to the United States or moved to the industrial centres of Lancashire, Yorkshire and the Midlands.[37] In her poetical illustration \"Liverpool\" (1832), which celebrates the city's worldwide commerce, Letitia Elizabeth Landon refers specifically to the Macgregor Laird expedition to the Niger River, at that time in progress.[38] This is to a painting by Samuel Austin, Liverpool, from the Mersey.[39] Britain was a major market for cotton imported from the Deep South of the United States, which fed the textile industry in the country. Given the crucial place cotton held in the city's economy, during the American Civil War Liverpool was, in the words of historian Sven Beckert, \"the most pro-Confederate place in the world outside the Confederacy itself.\"[40] Liverpool merchants helped to bring out cotton from ports blockaded by the Union Navy, built ships of war for the Confederacy, and supplied the South with military equipment and credit.[41] During the war, the Confederate Navy ship, the CSS Alabama, was built at Birkenhead on the Mersey, and the CSS Shenandoah surrendered there (being the final surrender at the end of the war). The city was also the center of Confederate purchasing war materiel, including arms and ammunition, uniforms, and naval supplies to be smuggled by British blockade runners to the South.[42] For periods during the 19th century, the wealth of Liverpool exceeded that of London,[43] and Liverpool's Custom House was the single largest contributor to the British Exchequer.[44] Liverpool was the only British city ever to have its own Whitehall office.[45] During this century, at least 40% of the world's entire trade passed through Liverpool.[46] In the early 19th century, Liverpool played a major role in the Antarctic sealing industry, in recognition of which Liverpool Beach in the South Shetland Islands is named after the city.[47] As early as 1851, the city was described as \"the New York of Europe\".[48] During the late 19th and early 20th century, Liverpool was attracting immigrants from across Europe. This resulted in the construction of a diverse array of religious buildings in the city for the new ethnic and religious groups, many of which are still in use today. The Deutsche Kirche Liverpool, Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas, Gustav Adolf Church and Princes Road Synagogue were all established in the 1800s to serve Liverpool's growing German, Greek, Nordic and Jewish communities, respectively. One of Liverpool's oldest surviving churches, St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church, served the Polish community in its final years as a place of worship. The 20th century saw Liverpool's established rank as a global economic powerhouse challenged. Its strategic location as an international seaport made it particularly vulnerable in two World wars. Economic depressions (both in the United Kingdom and across the world), changing housing patterns and containerisation in the maritime industry contributed to a downtrend in the city's productivity and prosperity. Despite this, the city's influence on global popular culture excelled and by the end of the century, the continuing process of urban renewal paved the way for the redefined modern city of the 21st century. The period after the Great War was marked by social unrest, as society grappled with the massive war losses of young men, as well as trying to re-integrate veterans into civilian life and the economy. Unemployment and poor living standards greeted many ex-servicemen. Union organising and strikes took place in numerous locations, including a police strike in Liverpool among the City Police. Numerous colonial soldiers and sailors from Africa and India, who had served with the British Armed Forces, settled in Liverpool and other port cities. In June 1919, they were subject to attack by whites in racial riots; residents in the port included Swedish immigrants, and both groups had to compete with native people from Liverpool for jobs and housing. In this period, race riots also took place in other port cities.[49] The Housing Act 1919 resulted in mass council housing being built across Liverpool during the 1920s and 1930s. In the 1920s and 1930s, as much as 15% of the city's population (around 140,000 people) was relocated from the inner-city to new purpose built, lower density suburban housing estates, based on the belief that this would improve their standard of living, though the overall benefits have been contested.[50][51] Numerous private homes were also built during this era. During the Great Depression of the early 1930s, unemployment peaked at around 30% in the city. Liverpool was the site of Britain's first provincial airport, operating from 1930. During the Second World War, the critical strategic importance of Liverpool was recognised by both Hitler and Churchill. The city was heavily bombed by the Germans, suffering a blitz second only to London's.[52] The pivotal Battle of the Atlantic was planned, fought and won from Liverpool.[53] The Luftwaffe made 80 air raids on Merseyside, killing 2,500 people and causing damage to almost half the homes in the metropolitan area. Significant rebuilding followed the war, including massive housing estates and the Seaforth Dock, the largest dock project in Britain. Since 1952, Liverpool has been twinned with Cologne, Germany, a city which also suffered severe aerial bombing during the war. In the 1950s and 1960s, much of the immediate reconstruction that took place in the city centre proved to be deeply unpopular. The historic portions of the city that had survived German bombing suffered extensive destruction during urban renewal. It has been argued that the so-called \"Shankland Plan\" of the 1960s, named after the town planner Graeme Shankland, led to compromised town planning and vast road-building schemes that devastated and divided inner city neighbourhoods. Concrete brutalist architecture, compromised visions, botched projects and grand designs that were never realised became the subject of condemnation. Historian Raphael Samuel labelled Graeme Shankland \"the butcher of Liverpool\".[54][55][56][57] A significant West Indian black community has existed in the city since the first two decades of the 20th century. Like most British cities and industrialised towns, Liverpool became home to a significant number of Commonwealth immigrants, beginning after World War I with colonial soldiers and sailors who had served in the area. More immigrants arrived after World War II, mostly settling in older inner-city areas such as Toxteth, where housing was less expensive. The black population of Liverpool was recorded at 1.90% in 2011. In the 2021 Census, 5.2% described themselves as black African, Caribbean, mixed white and black African, mixed white and Caribbean or 'other black'.[58][59] In the 1960s, Liverpool was the centre of the \"Merseybeat\" sound, which became synonymous with the Beatles and fellow Liverpudlian rock bands. Influenced by American rhythm and blues and rock music, they also in turn strongly affected American music. The Beatles became internationally known in the early 1960s and performed around the world together; they were, and continue to be, the most commercially successful and musically influential band in popular history. Their co-founder, singer, and composer John Lennon was killed in New York City in 1980. Liverpool Airport was renamed after him in 2002, the first British airport to be named in honour of an individual.[60][61] Previously part of Lancashire, and a county borough from 1889, Liverpool became a metropolitan borough within the newly created metropolitan county of Merseyside, in 1974. From the mid-1970s onwards, Liverpool's docks and traditional manufacturing industries declined due to restructuring of shipping and heavy industry, causing massive losses of jobs. The advent of containerisation meant that the city's docks became largely obsolete, and dock workers were made unemployed. By the early 1980s, unemployment rates in Liverpool were among the highest in the UK,[62] standing at 17% by January 1982 although, this was about half the level of unemployment that had affected the city during the Great Depression some 50 years previously.[63] During this period, Liverpool became a hub of fierce left-wing opposition to the central government in London.[64] Liverpool in the 1980s has been labelled as Britain's 'shock city'. Once the acclaimed second city of the British Empire which rivalled the capital city in global significance, Liverpool had collapsed in to its 'nadir' at the depths of post-colonial, post-industrial Britain.[65][66] In the late 20th century, Liverpool's economy began to recover. The late 1980s saw the opening of a regenerated Albert Dock which proved to be a catalyst for further regeneration.[67] In the mid-1990s, the city enjoyed growth rates higher than the national average. At the end of the 20th century, Liverpool was concentrating on regeneration, a process that continues today. Ongoing regeneration combined with the hosting of internationally significant events has helped to re-purpose Liverpool as one of the most visited, tourist orientated, cities in the United Kingdom. City leaders are focussing on long-term strategies to grow the city's population and economy, while national government explores the continuous potential for devolution in the city. In 2002, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh visited Liverpool to mark the Golden Jubilee. On speaking to an audience at Liverpool Town Hall, the Queen recognised Liverpool as \"one of the most distinctive and energetic parts of the United Kingdom\", and paid tribute to the city's \"major orchestras, world-class museums and galleries\". She also acknowledged Liverpool's bid to become the European Capital of Culture.[68][69] To celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 2002, the conservation charity Plantlife organised a competition to choose county flowers; the sea-holly was Liverpool's final choice. The initiative was designed to highlight growing threats to the UK's flower species and also ask the public about which flowers best represented their county.[70] Capitalising on the popularity of 1960s rock groups, such as the Beatles, as well as the city's world-class art galleries, museums and landmarks, tourism and culture have become a significant factor in Liverpool's economy. In 2004, property developer Grosvenor started the Paradise Project, a £920 million development based on Paradise Street. This produced one of the most significant changes to Liverpool's city centre since the post-war reconstruction. Renamed as 'Liverpool One,' the centre opened in May 2008. In 2007, events and celebrations took place in honour of the 800th anniversary of the founding of the borough of Liverpool. Liverpool was designated as a joint European Capital of Culture for 2008. The celebrations included the erection of La Princesse, a large mechanical spider 20 metres high and weighing 37 tonnes, which represented the \"eight legs\" of Liverpool: honour, history, music, the Mersey, the ports, governance, sunshine and culture. La Princesse roamed the streets of the city during the festivities, and concluded by entering the Queensway Tunnel. Spearheaded by the multi-billion-pound Liverpool ONE development, regeneration continued throughout the 2010s. Some of the most significant redevelopment projects included new buildings in the Commercial District, King's Dock, Mann Island, around Lime Street, the Baltic Triangle, RopeWalks, and Edge Lane.[71][72][73] Changes to Liverpool's governance took place in 2014. The local authority of Liverpool City Council decided to pool its power and resources with surrounding boroughs through the formation of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority in a form of devolution. With a devolved budget granted by central government, the authority now oversees and invests in foremost strategic affairs throughout the Liverpool City Region, including major regeneration projects. The authority, along with Liverpool City Council itself, has embarked on long-term plans to grow the population and economy of the city.[74][75][76][77] By the 2020s, urban regeneration throughout the city continues. Liverpool Waters, a mixed-use development in the city's disused northern docklands, has been identified as one of the largest megaprojects in the UK's history. Everton's new stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock was regarded as the largest single-site private sector development in the United Kingdom at the time of construction.[78][79] Major events, business and political conferences regularly take place in the city and form an important part of the economy. In June 2014, Prime Minister David Cameron launched the International Festival for Business in Liverpool, the world's largest business event in 2014,[80] and the largest in the UK since the Festival of Britain in 1951.[81] The Labour Party has chosen Liverpool numerous times since the mid 2010s for their annual Labour Party Conference. Liverpool hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 2023. Liverpool has been a centre of invention and innovation. Railways, transatlantic steamships, municipal trams,[82] and electric trains were all pioneered in Liverpool as modes of mass transit. In 1829 and 1836, the first railway tunnels in the world were constructed under Liverpool (Wapping Tunnel). From 1950 to 1951, the world's first scheduled passenger helicopter service ran between Liverpool and Cardiff.[83] The first School for the Blind,[84] Mechanics' Institute,[85] High School for Girls,[86][87] council house,[88] and Juvenile Court[89] were all founded in Liverpool. Charities such as the RSPCA,[90] NSPCC,[91] Age Concern,[92] Relate, and Citizen's Advice Bureau[93] all evolved from work in the city. The first lifeboat station, public bath and wash-house,[94] sanitary act,[95] medical officer for health (William Henry Duncan), district nurse, slum clearance,[96] purpose-built ambulance,[97] X-ray medical diagnosis,[98] school of tropical medicine (Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine), motorised municipal fire-engine,[99] free school meal,[100] cancer research centre,[101] and zoonosis research centre[102] all originated in Liverpool. The first British Nobel Prize was awarded in 1902 to Ronald Ross, professor at the School of Tropical Medicine, the first school of its kind in the world.[103] Orthopaedic surgery was pioneered in Liverpool by Hugh Owen Thomas,[104] and modern medical anaesthetics by Thomas Cecil Gray. The world's first integrated sewer system was constructed in Liverpool by James Newlands, appointed in 1847 as the UK's first borough engineer.[105][106] Liverpool also founded the UK's first Underwriters' Association[107] and the first Institute of Accountants. The Western world's first financial derivatives (cotton futures) were traded on the Liverpool Cotton Exchange in the late 1700s.[108] In the arts, Liverpool was home to the first lending library (The Lyceum), athenaeum society (Liverpool Athenaeum), arts centre (Bluecoat Chambers),[109] and public art conservation centre (National Conservation Centre).[110] It is also home to the UK's oldest surviving classical orchestra (Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra)[111] and repertory theatre (Liverpool Playhouse).[112] In 1864, Peter Ellis built the world's first iron-framed, curtain-walled office building, Oriel Chambers, which was a prototype of the skyscraper. The UK's first purpose-built department store was Compton House, completed in 1867 for the retailer J.R. Jeffrey.[113] It was the largest store in the world at the time.[114] Between 1862 and 1867, Liverpool held an annual Grand Olympic Festival. Devised by John Hulley and Charles Pierre Melly, these games were the first to be wholly amateur in nature and international in outlook.[115][116] The programme of the first modern Olympiad in Athens in 1896 was almost identical to that of the Liverpool Olympics.[117] In 1865, Hulley co-founded the National Olympian Association in Liverpool, a forerunner of the British Olympic Association. Its articles of foundation provided the framework for the Olympic Charter. A concept devised by retail entrepreneur David Lewis, the first Christmas grotto opened in Lewis's department store in Liverpool in 1879.[118] Sir Alfred Lewis Jones, a shipowner, introduced bananas to the UK via Liverpool's docks in 1884.[119] The Mersey Railway, opened in 1886, incorporated the world's first tunnel under a tidal estuary[120] and the world's first deep-level underground stations (Liverpool James Street railway station). In 1889, borough engineer John Alexander Brodie invented the football goal net. He was also a pioneer in the use of pre-fabricated housing[122] and oversaw the construction of the UK's first ring road (A5058) and intercity highway (East Lancashire Road), as well as the Queensway Tunnel linking Liverpool and Birkenhead. Described as \"the eighth wonder of the world\" at the time of its construction, it was the longest underwater tunnel in the world for 24 years. In 1897, the Lumière brothers filmed Liverpool,[123] including what is believed to be the world's first tracking shot,[124] taken from the Liverpool Overhead Railway, the world's first elevated electrified railway. The Overhead Railway was the first railway in the world to use electric multiple units, employ automatic signalling, and install an escalator. Liverpool inventor Frank Hornby was a visionary in toy development and manufacture, producing three of the most popular lines of toys in the 20th century: Meccano, Hornby Model Railways (both in 1901), and Dinky Toys in 1934.[125] The British Interplanetary Society, founded in Liverpool in 1933 by Phillip Ellaby Cleator, is the world's oldest existing organisation devoted to the promotion of spaceflight. Its journal, the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society, is the longest-running astronautical publication in the world.[126] In 1999, Liverpool was the first city outside London to be awarded blue plaques by English Heritage in recognition of the \"significant contribution made by its sons and daughters in all walks of life\".[127] For the purposes of local government, Liverpool is classified as a metropolitan borough with city status. The metropolitan borough is located within both the county of Merseyside and the Liverpool City Region. Each of these geographical areas is treated as an administrative area with different levels of local governance applying to each. Liverpool City Council is the governing body solely for the Metropolitan Borough of Liverpool and performs functions that are standard of an English Unitary Authority. The Liverpool City Region Combined Authority and the Mayor of the Liverpool City Region reserve major strategic powers over such things as transport, economic development and regeneration for the city along with the 5 surrounding boroughs of the Liverpool City Region. The Combined Authority has competency over areas which have been devolved by national government and are specific to the city region.[128] Nevertheless, there are a few exceptions to local governance apart from these two structures. Liverpool was administered by Merseyside County Council between 1974 and 1986 and some residual aspects of organisation which date back to this time have survived. When the County Council was disbanded in 1986, most civic functions were transferred to Liverpool City Council. However, several authorities such as the police and fire and rescue service, continue to be run at a county-wide level. The county of Merseyside, therefore, continues to exist as an administrative area for a few limited services only, while the capability and capacity of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority is evolving over time.[129] The city also elects five members of Parliament (MPs) to the Westminster Parliament, all Labour as of the 2024 general election. Liverpool City Council operates under a constitution comprising 85 city councillors who are directly elected by the Liverpool electorate every 4 years and represent a variety of different political parties. The city councillors make decisions about local services for the city's people. At each election, the political party that wins the majority of the 85 council seats leads the council for the following 4 years. The local leader of this party assumes the role of Leader of the City Council who then chairs a Cabinet of 9 councillors who are assigned specific responsibilities known as 'portfolios'. The incumbent Leader of Liverpool City Council is Councillor Liam Robinson, who represents the Labour Party, which secured a large majority at the 2023 local election,[131] the Leader is also a member of the Mayor of the Liverpool City Regions cabinet (Separate from the City Council Cabinet), at present Robinson holds the portfolio of Cabinet Member for Innovation. The City Council's decisions and scrutiny of activities are undertaken by a number of different committees and panels which include the Overview and Scrutiny Committees, Scrutiny Panels, Regulatory Committees and other committees. The day-to-day management of the council is carried out by the management team which includes the Chief Executive and several directors and senior officers. The management team works with the Cabinet and councillors to deliver strategic direction and priorities such as the budget and the City Plan.[132][133] Every four years, the city elects 85 councillors from 64 local council wards.[134] During the 2023 Liverpool City Council election, the Labour Party consolidated its control of Liverpool City Council, following on from the previous elections. Out of the total 85 City Council seats up for election, The Labour Party won 61 seats (53.13% of the electorate's total votes), the Liberal Democrats won 15 seats (21.61% of the votes), the Green Party won 3 seats (9.76% of the votes), the Liverpool Community Independents won 3 seats (4.64% of the votes) and the Liberal Party won the remaining 3 seats (3.21% of the votes). The Conservative Party, the political party in power at national government, had no representation on Liverpool City Council. Only 27.27% of the eligible Liverpool electorate turned out to vote.[135] Throughout most of the 19th and early 20th centuries, Liverpool was a municipal stronghold of Toryism. However, support for the Conservative Party in recent times has been among the lowest in any part of Britain, particularly since the monetarist economic policies of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher. After the 1979 general election, many have claimed that her victory contributed to longstanding high unemployment and decline in the city.[136] Liverpool is one of the Labour Party's key strongholds; however, the city has also seen hard times under Labour governments. Particularly in the Winter of Discontent (late 1978 and early 1979) when Liverpool suffered public sector strikes along with the rest of the United Kingdom, but also when it suffered the particularly humiliating misfortune of having grave-diggers going on strike, leaving the dead unburied for long periods.[137] In recent years, Liverpool City Council began an extensive improvement program designed to ensure that the authority makes efficient use of taxpayer's money and to encourage more business and investment in the city. Grosvenor Group, the property company responsible for Liverpool One, commended the changes as an \"opportunity for bold thinking in liverpool\".[138] In 2021, a highly critical government inspection and subsequent report of Liverpool City Council (referred to as the Caller report) identified multiple shortcomings at Liverpool City Council. The Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, Robert Jenrick sent government commissioners to oversee the City Council's highways, regeneration, property management, governance and financial decision-making. The authority was compelled to commit to a three-year improvement plan in which the entire structure of the council would be overhauled. As a result of the intervention, major structural changes at the City Council took place by the 2023 United Kingdom local elections, which were labelled \"the most unpredictable [elections] in the city's history\". The number of electoral wards in the city was doubled from 30 to 64, while the overall number of City Councillors up for election was reduced from 90 to 85. In future, the council would also change to 'all out' elections every four years whereby every single City Councillor would be eligible for re-election at the same time. The role of elected city mayor was also abolished and the Council reverted to the previous Leader and Cabinet style of leadership. The outcome of the elections were seen not only as a test of how the general public would respond to the government intervention in the city, but also to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's government as a whole.[139][140][141][142] Councillor Liam Robinson became the new Leader of Liverpool City Council at the 2023 City Council election. The Liverpool Strategic Futures Advisory Panel, chaired by the Mayor of Liverpool City Region Steve Rotheram, and including several high-profile figures with experience in local government, was established. The panel was tasked with directing the council's long-term future outside of government intervention measures and to advise on plans and priorities that the city should pursue.[143] In February 2008, Liverpool City Council was reported to be the worst-performing council in the country, receiving just a one-star rating (classified as inadequate). The main cause of the poor rating was attributed to the council's poor handling of tax-payer money, including the accumulation of a £20m shortfall while the city held the title of European Capital of Culture.[144] In April 2024, the Office for Local Government released a ranking of local authorities, placing Liverpool City Council 317th out of a possible 318.[145] The Lord Mayor of Liverpool is an ancient ceremonial role. Councillors within Liverpool City Council (not the general public) elect the Lord Mayor annually, who then serves a one-year term. The Lord Mayor is styled as the \"first citizen\" and is chosen to represent the city at civic functions and engagements, promote it to the wider world, support local charities and community groups, attend religious events, meet delegates from Liverpool's twin cities, chair council meetings and confer Honorary Freemen and associations.[146] The Lord Mayor is also the presiding officer for Liverpool City Council full meetings. . Liverpool is one of the six constituent boroughs of the Liverpool City Region. The Mayor of the Liverpool City Region is directly every four years by residents of those six boroughs and oversees the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority. The Combined Authority is the top-tier administrative body for the local governance of the city region and is tasked with taking major strategic decisions on issues such as transport and investment, economic development, employment and skills, tourism, culture, housing and physical infrastructure. The current Mayor is Steve Rotheram. Liverpool is included within five parliamentary constituencies, through which MPs are elected to represent the city in Westminster: Liverpool Riverside, Liverpool Walton, Liverpool Wavertree, Liverpool West Derby and Garston and Halewood.[147] At the last general election, all were won by Labour with representation being from Kim Johnson, Dan Carden, Paula Barker and Ian Byrne respectively.[148] Due to boundary changes prior to the 2010 election, the Liverpool Garston constituency was merged with most of Knowsley South to form the Garston and Halewood cross-boundary seat. At the most recent 2024 election, this seat was won by Maria Eagle of the Labour Party.[148] Liverpool has been described as having \"the most splendid setting of any English city.\"[149] At 53°24′0″N 2°59′0″W﻿ / ﻿53.40000°N 2.98333°W﻿ / 53.40000; -2.98333 (53.4, −2.98), 176 miles (283 kilometres) northwest of London, located on the Liverpool Bay of the Irish Sea, Liverpool is built across a ridge of sandstone hills rising up to a height of around 230 feet (70 m) above sea-level at Everton Hill, which represents the southern boundary of the West Lancashire Coastal Plain. The Mersey Estuary separates Liverpool from the Wirral Peninsula. The boundaries of Liverpool are adjacent to Bootle, Crosby and Maghull in south Sefton to the north, and Kirkby, Huyton, Prescot and Halewood in Knowsley to the east. Liverpool experiences a temperate maritime climate (Köppen: Cfb), like much of the British Isles, with relatively mild summers, cool winters and rainfall spread fairly evenly throughout the year. Rainfall and temperature records had been kept at Bidston Hill since 1867, but records for atmospheric pressure go back as far as at least 1846.[150] Bidston closed down in 2002 but the Met Office also has a weather station at Crosby. Since records began in 1867, temperatures have ranged from −17.6 °C (0.3 °F) on 21 December 2010 to 34.5 °C (94.1 °F) on 2 August 1990, although Liverpool Airport recorded a temperature of 35.0 °C (95.0 °F) on 19 July 2006.[151] The lowest amount of sunshine on record was 16.5 hours in December 1927 whereas the most was 314.5 hours in July 2013.[152][153] Tornado activity or funnel cloud formation is very rare in and around the Liverpool area and tornadoes that do form are usually weak. Recent tornadoes or funnel clouds in Merseyside have been seen in 1998 and 2014.[154][155] During the period 1981–2010, Crosby recorded an average of 32.8 days of air frost per year, which is low for the United Kingdom.[156] Snow is fairly common during the winter although heavy snow is rare. Snow generally falls between November and March but can occasionally fall earlier and later. In recent times, the earliest snowfall was on 1 October 2008[157] while the latest occurred on 15 May 2012.[158] Although historically, the earliest snowfall occurred on 10 September 1908[159] and the latest on 2 June 1975.[160] Rainfall, although light, is quite a common occurrence in Liverpool, with the wettest month on record being August 1956, which recorded 221.2 mm (8.71 in) of rain and the driest being February 1932, with 0.9 mm (0.035 in).[161] The driest year on record was 1991, with 480.5 mm (18.92 in) of rainfall and the wettest was 1872, with 1,159.9 mm (45.67 in).[162] Suburbs and districts of Liverpool include: In 2010, Liverpool City Council and the Primary Care Trust commissioned the Mersey Forest to complete \"A Green Infrastructure Strategy\" for the city.[171] Liverpool is a core urban element of a green belt region that extends into the wider surrounding counties, which is in place to reduce urban sprawl, prevent the towns in the conurbation from further convergence, protect the identity of outlying communities, encourage brownfield reuse, and preserve nearby countryside. This is achieved by restricting inappropriate development within the designated areas and imposing stricter conditions on permitted building.[172] Due to being already highly built up, the city contains limited portions of protected green belt area within greenfield throughout the borough at Fazakerley, Croxteth Hall and country park and Craven Wood, Woodfields Park and nearby golf courses in Netherley, small greenfield tracts east of the Speke area by the St Ambrose primary school, and the small hamlet of Oglet and the surrounding area south of Liverpool Airport.[173] The green belt was first drawn up in 1983 under Merseyside County Council[174] and the size in the city amounts to 530 hectares (5.3 km2; 2.0 sq mi).[175] Since the mid-20th century, Scouser has become the predominant demonym for the inhabitants of Liverpool, and is strongly associated with the Scouse accent and dialect of the city.[176] The Scouse accent is described as progressively diverging from the Lancastrian accent in the late 19th century.[177][178][179][180][181] The etymology of Scouser is derived from the traditional dish Scouse brought to the area by sailors travelling through Liverpool's port.[182][181][183] Prior to the establishment of Scouser as there have been a number of different terms used to refer to inhabitants of Liverpool of varying popularity and longevity: Professor Tony Crowley argues that up until the 1950s, inhabitants of Liverpool were generally referred to by a number of demonyms. He argues that there was a debate in the mid 20th century between the two rival terms of 'Liverpolitan' and 'Liverpudlian'. The debate surrounded the lexicology of these terms and their connotations of social class.[183][187] Professor John Belchem suggests that a series of other nicknames such as 'Dick Liver', 'Dicky Sam' and 'whacker' were used, but gradually fell out of use. Belchem and Philip Boland suggest that comedic radio presenters and entertainers brought the Liverpool identity to a national audience, which in turn encouraged locals to be gradually more known as 'scousers'. By the time that Frank Shaw's My Liverpool, a Celebration of 'Scousetown' was published in 1971, Belchem argues that 'Scouser' had firmly become the dominant demonym.[176][188][189] The city of Liverpool is at the core of a much larger and more populous metropolitan area, however, at the most recent UK Census in 2021, the area governed by Liverpool City Council had a population of 486,100, a 4.2% increase from the previous Census in 2011. This figure increased to 500,500 people by 2022, according to data from Liverpool City Council. Taking in to account how local government is organised within the cities and metropolitan areas of England, the Liverpool was the fifth largest of England's 'core cities' and had the second overall highest population density of those, by 2021.[201][202] The population of the city has steadily risen since the 2001 Census. As well as having a growing population, the population density also grew at the 2021 Census compared to the previous Census. Since 2011, its population size ranked 10th out of 309 local authority areas.[203] The population of the city is comparatively younger than that of England as a whole. Family life in the city is also growing at odds with the North West England region as a whole: At the 2021 Census, the percentage of households including a couple without children increased in Liverpool, but fell across the North West. The percentage of people aged 16 years and over (excluding full-time students) who were employed also increased in Liverpool compared to the overall North West region where it fell. The 2021 Census also showed that Liverpool's ethnic and international population was growing. The number of residents in the city born outside of England has increased since the previous Census, while the number of residents who did not identify with any national identity associated with the UK has also increased at a faster rate than England as a whole. The overall share of the city's population who identified as Asian and Black increased, while the percentage who identified as white decreased in the city compared with previous Census.[204] It has been argued that the city can claim to have one of the strongest Irish heritages in the United Kingdom, with as many as 75 percent (estimated) of Liverpool's population with some form of Irish ancestry.[205] The growing population of Liverpool in the 21st century reverses a trend which took place between the 1930s and 2001, when the population of the city proper effectively halved. At the 1931 United Kingdom census, Liverpool's population reached an all-time high of 846,302. Following this peak, in response to central government policy, the Council authority of Liverpool then built and owned large several 'new town' council estates in the suburbs within Liverpool's metropolitan area. Tens of thousands of people were systematically relocated to new housing in areas such as Halton, Knowsley, St Helens, Sefton, Wirral, Cheshire West and Chester, West Lancashire, Warrington and as far as North Wales. Such a mass relocation and population loss during this time was common practice for many British cities, including London and Manchester, In contrast, satellite towns such as Kirkby, Skelmersdale and Runcorn saw a corresponding rise in their populations (Kirkby being the fastest growing town in Britain during the 1960s).[206][207][204][208] Liverpool is typically grouped with the wider Merseyside (plus Halton) area for the purpose of defining its metropolitan footprint, and there are several methodologies. Sometimes, this metropolitan area is broadened to encompass urban settlements in the neighbouring counties of Lancashire and Cheshire.[209][210] The Office for National Statistics in the United Kingdom uses the international standardised International Territorial Levels (ITLs) to divide up the economic territory of the UK. This enables the ONS to calculate regional and local statistics and data. The ONS uses a series of codes to identify these areas. In order of hierarchy from largest area to smallest area, Liverpool is part of the following regions:[211][212][213] North West England (code TLD) At the 2021 Census, the ITL 1 region of North West England had a usual resident population of 7,417,300.[214] Merseyside (code TLD7) The ITL 2 region of Merseyside is defined as the area comprising East Merseyside (TLD71) plus Liverpool (TLD72), Sefton (TLD73) and Wirral (TLD74). At the 2021 Census, the population of this area was as follows:[215] East Merseyside (TLD71): Liverpool (TLD72) = 486,100 Sefton (TLD73) = 279,300 Wirral (TLD74) = 320,200 Therefore, the total population of the ITL 2 Merseyside region was 1,551,500 based on the 2021 Census. The smallest ITL 3 area classed as Liverpool (code TLD72), therefore, had a population of 486,100 at the 2021 Census. At the 2021 Census, the ONS used a refreshed concept of built-up areas (BUAs) based on the physical built environment, using satellite imagery to recognise developed land, such as cities, towns, and villages. This allows the ONS to investigate economic and social statistics based on actual settlements where most people live. Data from the 2021 Census is not directly comparable with 2011 Census data due to this revised methodology. Using the population figures of BUAs at the 2021 Census (excluding London), Liverpool Built-up Area is the third largest in England with some 506,565 usual residents (behind only Birmingham and Leeds). Liverpool's built-up area is, therefore, larger than the major English cities of Bristol, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne, Nottingham and Sheffield.[216] Excluding London, the Liverpool City Region was the 4th largest combined authority area in England, by 2021. The population is approximately 1.6 million. The Liverpool City Region is a political and economic partnership between local authorities including Liverpool, plus the Metropolitan boroughs of Knowsley, Sefton, St Helens, Wirral and the Borough of Halton. The Liverpool City Region Combined Authority exercises strategic governance powers for the region in many areas. The economic data of the Liverpool city region is of particular policy interest to the Office for National Statistics, particularly as the British Government continuously explores the potential to negotiate increased devolved powers for each combined authority area.[217][218][219][220] A 2011 report, Liverpool City Region – Building on its Strengths, by Lord Heseltine and Terry Leahy, stated that \"what is now called Liverpool City Region has a population of around 1.5 million\", but also referred to \"an urban region that spreads from Wrexham and Flintshire to Chester, Warrington, West Lancashire and across to Southport\", with a population of 2.3 million.[221] In 2006, in an attempt to harmonise the series of metropolitan areas across the European Union, ESPON (now European Observation Network for Territorial Development and Cohesion) released a study defining a \"Liverpool/Birkenhead Metropolitan area\" with an estimated population of 2,241,000 people. The metro area comprised a functional urban area consisting of a contiguous urban sprawl, labour pool, and commuter Travel to work areas. The analysis defined this metropolitan area as Liverpool itself, combined with the surrounding areas of Birkenhead, Wigan/Ashton, Warrington, Widnes/Runcorn, Chester, Southport, Ellesmere Port, Ormskirk and Skelmersdale.[222] Liverpool and Manchester are sometimes considered as one large polynuclear metropolitan area,[223][224][225] or megalopolis. In recent decades, Liverpool's population is becoming more multicultural. According to the 2021 census, 77% of all Liverpool residents described their ethnic group as White English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish or British. The remaining 23% were described as non-White English/British. Between 2011 and 2021, there was population growth across all ethnic groups, except 'White English/British' and 'Any Other', where there were overall losses. The number of 'Other White residents' in Liverpool also increased by almost 12,000 people, with notable increases in the 'Other Asian', 'Arab', and 'Other Mixed/Multiple' population categories. The non-White English/British population as a percentage of the total population across the 'newly organised city electoral wards' ranged from 5% in the Orrell Park ward to 69% in the Princes Park ward. 9 out of 10 Liverpool residents regarded English as their main language. The highest non-English languages in the city were Arabic (5,743 main speakers) followed by Polish (4,809 main speakers). Overall, almost 45,000 residents had a main language that was not English.[226] According to a 2014 survey, the ten most popular surnames of Liverpool and their occurrence in the population are:[228][229] Liverpool is home to Britain's oldest Black community, dating to at least the 1730s. Some Liverpudlians can trace their black ancestry in the city back ten generations.[230] Early Black settlers in the city included seamen, the children of traders sent to be educated, and freed slaves, since slaves entering the country after 1722 were deemed free men.[231] Since the 20th century, Liverpool is also noted for its large African-Caribbean,[4] Ghanaian,[232] and Somali[233] communities, formed of more recent African-descended immigrants and their subsequent generations. The city is also home to the oldest Chinese community in Europe; the first residents of the city's Chinatown arrived as seamen in the 19th century.[234] The traditional Chinese gateway erected in Liverpool's Chinatown is the largest such gateway outside China. Liverpool also has a long-standing Filipino community. Lita Roza, a singer from Liverpool who was the first woman to achieve a UK number one hit, had Filipino ancestry. The city is also known for its large Irish and Welsh populations.[235] In 1813, 10 per cent of Liverpool's population was Welsh, leading to the city becoming known as \"the capital of North Wales.\"[235] During, and in the decades following, the Great Irish Famine in the mid-19th century, up to two million Irish people travelled to Liverpool within one decade, with many subsequently departing for the United States.[236] By 1851, more than 20 per cent of the population of Liverpool was Irish.[237] At the 2001 Census, 1.17 per cent of the population were Welsh-born and 0.75 per cent were born in the Republic of Ireland, while 0.54 per cent were born in Northern Ireland,[238] but many more Liverpudlians are of legacy Welsh or Irish ancestry.[239] Other contemporary ethnicities include Indian,[4] Latin American,[240] Malaysian,[241] and Yemeni[242] communities, which number several thousand each. The thousands of migrants and sailors passing through Liverpool resulted in a religious diversity that is still apparent today. This is reflected in the equally diverse collection of religious buildings,[244] including two Christian cathedrals. Liverpool is known to be England's 'most Catholic city', with a Catholic population much larger than in other parts of England.[245] This is mainly due to high historic Irish migration to the city and their descendants since.[246] The parish church of Liverpool is the Anglican Our Lady and St Nicholas, colloquially known as \"the sailors church\", which has existed near the waterfront since 1257. It regularly plays host to Catholic masses. Other notable churches include the Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas (built in the Neo-Byzantine architecture style), and the Gustav Adolf Church (the Swedish Seamen's Church, reminiscent of Nordic styles). Liverpool's wealth as a port city enabled the construction of two enormous cathedrals in the 20th century. The Anglican Cathedral, which was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott and plays host to the annual Liverpool Shakespeare Festival, has one of the longest naves, largest organs and heaviest and highest peals of bells in the world. The Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral, on Mount Pleasant next to Liverpool Science Park, was initially planned to be even larger. Of Sir Edwin Lutyens's original design, only the crypt was completed. The cathedral was eventually built to a simpler design by Sir Frederick Gibberd. While this is on a smaller scale than Lutyens' original design, it still incorporates the largest panel of stained glass in the world. The road running between the two cathedrals is called Hope Street. The cathedral has long been colloquially referred to as \"Paddy's Wigwam\" due to its shape.[247] Liverpool contains several synagogues, of which the Grade I listed Moorish Revival Princes Road Synagogue is architecturally the most notable. Princes Road is widely considered to be the most magnificent of Britain's Moorish Revival synagogues and one of the finest buildings in Liverpool.[248] Liverpool has a thriving Jewish community with a further two orthodox Synagogues, one in the Allerton district of the city and a second in the Childwall district of the city where a significant Jewish community reside. A third orthodox Synagogue in the Greenbank Park area of L17 has recently closed and is a listed 1930s structure. There is also a Lubavitch Chabad House and a reform Synagogue. Liverpool has had a Jewish community since the mid-18th century. The Jewish population of Liverpool is around 5,000.[249] The Liverpool Talmudical College existed from 1914 until 1990, when its classes moved to the Childwall Synagogue.[citation needed] Liverpool also has a Hindu community, with a Mandir on Edge Lane, Edge Hill. The Shri Radha Krishna Temple from the Hindu Cultural Organisation in Liverpool is located there.[250] Liverpool also has the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Wavertree[251] and a Baháʼí Centre in the same area.[252] The city had the earliest Mosque in England and possibly the UK, founded in 1887 by William Abdullah Quilliam, a lawyer who had converted to Islam who set up the Liverpool Muslim Institute in a terraced house on West Derby Road.[253] Apart from the first mosque in England which now houses a museum,[254][255] the largest and main one, Al-Rahma mosque, was also the third purpose-built mosque in the United Kingdom.[256] The second largest mosque in Liverpool is the Masjid Al-Taiseer.[257] Other mosques in the city include the Bait ul Lateef Ahmadiyya Mosque,[258] Hamza Center (Community Center),[259] Islamic community centre,[260] Liverpool Mosque and Islamic Institute,[261] Liverpool Towhid Centre,[262] Masjid Annour,[263] and the Shah Jalal Mosque.[264] Liverpool forms an integral part of North West England's economy, the third largest regional economy in the United Kingdom. The city is also a major contributor to the economy of Liverpool City Region, worth over £40 billion per year.[268][269][270] The local authority area governed by Liverpool City Council accounts for 39% of the Liverpool city region's total jobs, 40% of its total GVA and 35% of its total businesses. At the local authority level, the city's GVA (balanced) at current basic prices was £14.3 billion in 2021. Its GDP at current market prices was £15.9 billion. This equates to £32,841 per head of the population.[271][272] At the 2021 United Kingdom census, 51.1% of Liverpool's population aged 16 years and over was classed as employed, 44.2% economically inactive and 4.8% unemployed. Of those employed, the most popular industries providing the employment were human health and social work activities (18.7%), wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motor cycles (15%), education (10.8%), public administration and defence; compulsory social security (7.3%), accommodation and food service activities (6.8%), construction (6.5%), transport and storage (5.8%), manufacturing (5.5%) and professional, scientific and technical activities (5.2%).[273] According to the ONS Business Register and Employment Survey 2021, some industries within Liverpool perform strongly compared to other local authorities in Great Britain. In terms of absolute number of jobs per industry in Great Britain's local authority areas, Liverpool features in the national top 10 for human health and social work activities; arts, entertainment and recreation; public administration and defence; compulsory social security; accommodation and food service activities and real estate activities. Liverpool features in the national top 20 for number of jobs in education; construction; wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles; transportation and storage; financial and insurance activities and professional, scientific and technical activities.[274] In 2023, Liverpool City Council set out an economic growth plan for the city over the following 20 years. The City Council will have particular focus on economic sectors such as the visitor economy (tourism), culture, life sciences, digital and creative sectors, and advanced car manufacturing.[275] According to the International passenger Survey, from the ONS, Liverpool was one of the top 5 most visited cities in the UK by overseas tourists in 2022. As of the same year, the city's tourist industry was worth a total of £3.5 billion annually and was part of a larger city region tourist industry worth £5 billion. A consistent calendar of major events, as well as a plethora of cultural attractions, continue to provide a significant draw for tourists. Tourism related to the Beatles is worth an estimated £100m to the Liverpool economy each year alone. Liverpool One, as well as a growing retail offer overall, has led to the city being one of the most prominent destinations for shopping in the UK. Liverpool Cruise Terminal, which is situated close to the Pier Head, enables tourists to berth in the centre of the city.[276][277][278][279][280][281][282] Liverpool is home to the Knowledge Quarter, a 450-acre city centre district that hosts some of the world's most influential institutions in science, health, technology, education, music and the creative performing arts. The UK government has also identified the city as a 'pharmaceutical production superpower' and one of the UK's leading regions for bioprocessing. The accolade led to the government choosing the city for England's second ever 'Investment Zone' in 2023. This will involve millions of pounds being invested over the coming years in to science orientated districts including the Knowledge Quarter and the so-called 'pharma cluster' in the city suburb of Speke. The two clusters form an internationally significant role in infectious disease control. Liverpool City Council also plan to invest in the city's Baltic Triangle, which is renowned in the creative and digital industries.[283][284][285][286][287][288] Car manufacturing also takes place in the city at the Jaguar Land Rover Halewood plant, where the Range Rover Evoque model is assembled. In 2023, Jaguar Land Rover announced that the Halewood plant would begin to shift its focus to electric car production.[289][290] Historically, the economy of Liverpool was centred on the city's port and manufacturing base. Today, the Port of Liverpool is the UK's fourth largest port by tonnage of freight, handling over 30 million tonnes in 2020. The city is also the UK's largest port for transatlantic trade, handling 45% of the country's trade from the United States. In 2023, the city was chosen by the British government to be a designated Freeport to encourage growing international commerce. The Liverpool2 container terminal, completed in 2022, has greatly increased the volume of cargo which Liverpool is able to handle and has facilitated the world's biggest container vessels.[291][292][293][294][295][296][297] Liverpool is also home to numerous UK headquarters, or the major strategic branch offices, of many shipping and freight lines including: Atlantic Container Line,[298] Bibby Line,[299] Borchard Lines Ltd,[300] CMA CGM,[301] Hapag-Lloyd,[302] Independent Container Line,[303] Irish Ferries,[304] Maersk Line,[305] Mediterranean Shipping Company[306] and Zim Integrated Shipping Services.[307] Liverpool's rich architectural base has helped the city become the second most filmed city in the UK outside London. As well as being a featured location in its own right, it often doubles up for Chicago, London, Moscow, New York City, Paris and Rome. The Depot studios, close to the city centre, provide space for film and TV productions.[308][309] Major economic projects planned for the city include the revitalisation of disused land in the North docks/Ten Streets area, Liverpool Waters and a new purpose built TV studio at the former Littlewoods Pools building, adjacent to the Depot.[310][311][312] The Liverpool City Region GDP in 2021 was £40.479 billion. The 6 contributing boroughs to this GDP were as follows:[313] The policy agenda of the British Government is to continuously monitor the economy and productivity of the UK's core cities within the context of their respective city regions. The government's longer-term plan is to assess each area's potential for increased devolution and transfer of additional powers and budgets from central government in Whitehall to their corresponding combined authorities. As such, official statistics about Liverpool's economy within the context of the Liverpool City Region, are closely monitored by the Office for National Statistics. This allows policy and decision makers to more accurately assess the 'functional economic area' of the city, which is not bound by traditional local government geographies.[314][315][316][317][318] As of 2023, there are 10 city regions in England with Combined Authorities. The economy of Liverpool's combined authority area in comparison to the other city regions is as follows: Liverpool's long commercial history has given rise to a considerable variety of architectural styles found within the city, ranging from 16th century Tudor buildings to modern-day contemporary architecture.[320] The majority of buildings in the city date from the late-18th century onwards, the period during which the city grew into one of the foremost powers in the British Empire.[321] There are over 2,500 listed buildings in Liverpool, of which 27 are Grade I listed[322] and 85 are Grade II* listed.[323] The city also has a greater number of public sculptures than any other location in the United Kingdom aside from Westminster and significant number of Georgian houses still exist.[324][325] This richness of architecture has subsequently seen Liverpool described by English Heritage, as England's finest Victorian city.[326] The value of Liverpool's architecture and design was recognised in 2004, when several areas throughout the city were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Known as the Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City, the sites were added in recognition of the city's role in the development of international trade and docking technology.[327] However, this status was revoked in July 2021, when UNESCO resolved that recent and proposed developments, such as the Bramley-Moore Dock Stadium and Liverpool Waters projects, had resulted in the \"serious deterioration\" of the area's significance.[328] As a major British port, the docks in Liverpool have historically been central to the city's development. Several major docking firsts have occurred in the city including the construction of the world's first enclosed wet dock (the Old Dock) in 1715 and the first ever hydraulic lifting cranes.[329] The best-known dock in Liverpool is the Royal Albert Dock, which was constructed in 1846 and today comprises the largest single collection of Grade I listed buildings anywhere in Britain.[330] Built under the guidance of Jesse Hartley, it was considered to be one of the most advanced docks anywhere in the world upon completion and is often attributed with helping the city to become one of the most important ports in the world. Today, the Royal Albert Dock houses restaurants, bars, shops, two hotels as well as the Merseyside Maritime Museum, International Slavery Museum, Tate Liverpool and The Beatles Story. North of the city centre is Stanley Dock, home to the Stanley Dock Tobacco Warehouse, which was at the time of its construction in 1901, the world's largest building in terms of area[331] and today stands as the world's largest brick-work building.[332] One of the most famous locations in Liverpool is the Pier Head, renowned for the trio of buildings – the Royal Liver Building, the Cunard Building and the Port of Liverpool Building – which sit upon it. Collectively referred to as the Three Graces, these buildings stand as a testament to the great wealth in the city during the late 19th and early 20th century. Built in a variety of architectural styles, they are recognised as being the symbol of 'maritime Liverpool' and are regarded by many as contributing to one of the most impressive waterfronts in the world.[333][334][335][336] In the 21st century, several areas along Liverpool's waterfront have undergone significant redevelopment. Among the notable developments are the Museum of Liverpool, the construction of the Liverpool Arena, ACC Liverpool and Exhibition Centre Liverpool on King's Dock, Alexandra Tower and 1 Princes Dock on Prince's Dock and Liverpool Marina around Coburg and Brunswick Docks. The Wheel of Liverpool opened on 25 March 2010.[337][338] However, plans to redevelop parts of Liverpool city centre have been marred by controversy. In December 2016, a newly formed company called North Point Global Ltd. was given the rights to develop part of the docks under the \"New Chinatown\" working name. Though heavily advertised in Liverpool, Hong Kong and Chinese cities with high-profile advertisements and videos, the \"New Chinatown\" development failed to materialise.[339] In January 2018, the Liverpool Echo and Asia Times revealed that the site remained sans any construction. North Point Global as well as its subcontractor \"Bilt\" had both declared bankruptcy, and the small investors (mostly middle class couples) who had already paid money for the apartments had lost most of their savings in them.[340] Liverpool's historic position as one of the most important trading ports in the world has meant that over time many grand buildings have been constructed in the city as headquarters for shipping firms, insurance companies, banks and other large firms. The great wealth this brought then allowed for the development of grand civic buildings, which were designed to allow the local administrators to 'run the city with pride'.[341] The commercial district is centred on the Castle Street, Dale Street and Old Hall Street areas of the city, with many of the area's roads still following their medieval layout. Having developed predominantly over a period of three centuries, the area is regarded as one of the most important architectural locations in the city, as recognised by its inclusion in Liverpool's former World Heritage site.[342] The oldest building in the area is the Grade I listed Liverpool Town Hall, which is located at the top of Castle Street and dates from 1754. Often regarded as the city's finest piece of Georgian architecture, the building is known as one of the most extravagantly decorated civic buildings anywhere in Britain.[343][344] Also on Castle Street is the Grade I listed Bank of England Building, constructed between 1845 and 1848, as one of only three provincial branches of the national bank.[343] Among the other buildings in the area are the Tower Buildings, Albion House (the former White Star Line headquarters), the Municipal Buildings and Oriel Chambers,[345] which is considered to be one of the earliest Modernist style buildings ever built.[346] The area around William Brown Street is referred to as the city's 'Cultural Quarter', owing to the presence of numerous civic buildings, including the William Brown Library, Walker Art Gallery, Picton Reading Rooms and World Museum Liverpool. The area is dominated by neo-classical architecture, of which the most prominent, St George's Hall,[347] is widely regarded as the best example of a neo-classical building anywhere in Europe.[348] A Grade I listed building, it was constructed between 1840 and 1855 to serve a variety of civic functions in the city and its doors are inscribed with \"S.P.Q.L.\" (Latin senatus populusque Liverpudliensis), meaning \"the senate and people of Liverpool\". William Brown Street is also home to numerous public monuments and sculptures, including Wellington's Column and the Steble Fountain. Many others are located around the area, particularly in St John's Gardens, which was specifically developed for this purpose.[349] The William Brown Street area has been likened to a modern recreation of the Roman Forum.[350] While the majority of Liverpool's architecture dates from the mid-18th century onwards, there are several buildings that pre-date this time. One of the oldest surviving buildings is Speke Hall, a Tudor manor house located in the south of the city, which was completed in 1598.[351] The building is one of the few remaining timber framed Tudor houses left in the north of England and is particularly noted for its Victorian interiors, which were added in the mid-19th century.[352] In addition to Speke Hall, many of the city's other oldest surviving buildings are also former manor houses including Croxteth Hall and Woolton Hall, which were completed in 1702 and 1704 respectively.[353] The oldest building within the city centre is the Grade I listed Bluecoat Chambers,[354] which was built between 1717 and 1718. Constructed in British Queen Anne style architecture,[355][356] the building was influenced in part by the work of Christopher Wren[357] and was originally the home of the Bluecoat School (who later moved to a larger site in Wavertree in the south of the city). Since 1908, it has acted as a centre for arts in Liverpool.[355] Liverpool is noted for having two Cathedrals, each of which imposes over the landscape around it.[358] The Anglican Cathedral, which was constructed between 1904 and 1978, is the largest Cathedral in Britain[359] and the fifth largest in the world. Designed and built in Gothic style, it is regarded as one of the greatest buildings to have been constructed during the 20th century[360] and was described by former British Poet Laureate, John Betjeman, as \"one of the great buildings of the world\".[361] The Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral was constructed between 1962 and 1967 and is known as one of the first cathedrals to break the traditional longitudinal design.[362] In the 21st century, many parts of Liverpool's city centre have undergone significant redevelopment and regeneration after years of decline. So far, the largest of these developments has been Liverpool One, which saw almost £1 billion invested in the redevelopment of 42 acres (17 hectares) of land, providing new retail, commercial, residential and leisure space.[363] Around the north of the city centre, several new skyscrapers have also been constructed including the RIBA award-winning Unity Buildings and West Tower, which at 140m is Liverpool's tallest building. Many redevelopment schemes are also in progress including Circus,[364] King's Dock,[365] Paddington Village[366] and Liverpool Waters.[367] There are many other notable buildings in Liverpool, including the art deco former terminal building of Speke Airport, the University of Liverpool's Victoria Building, (which provided the inspiration for the term Red Brick University), and the Adelphi Hotel, which was in the past considered to be one of the finest hotels anywhere in the world.[368] The Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England describes Merseyside's Victorian Parks as collectively the \"most important in the country\".[369] Liverpool has ten listed parks and cemeteries, including two Grade I and five Grade II*, more than any other English city apart from London.[370] Liverpool has an extensive transport infrastructure that connects the city with its metropolitan area, the rest of the United Kingdom, Europe and the world. Various modes of transport provide considerable connections by road, rail, air and sea. The local network of buses, trains and ferries is managed by Merseytravel on behalf of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority and the Metro Mayor of the Liverpool City Region. The Mayor and Combined Authority have control of a devolved transport budget and associated transport powers for this local system. The city's major port and international airport provide global links for both passengers and freight.[371][372] The city sits at the centre of a much larger metropolitan area. The city's suburbs run contiguously into the neighbouring boroughs defined by the ONS as the Liverpool Built-up Area. The wider City Region and Merseyside in general is densely urbanised and divided by several motorways and major roads. The city is served by a network motorways. The three motorways in closest proximity are the M58 to the north, and M62 and M57 to the east. To the north, the M58 motorway runs 12 miles and provides links to the neighbouring counties of Lancashire and Greater Manchester, finally joining with the M6 west of Wigan.[373] To the east, the M62 runs across the north of the UK, ultimately connecting Liverpool with Hull on the opposite coast, and along the route to several large cities including Manchester, Leeds and Bradford. The M62 also provides a connection to both the M6 and M1 motorways, providing indirect links to more distant areas including Birmingham, London, Nottingham, Preston and Sheffield.[374][375] To the east, but running north-south, the M57 acts as a 10-mile ring road for the city itself and links the M62 and M58 motorways, as well as the A580 East Lancashire Road providing a link directly to the A5300 that links to the bridges that cross the Mersey to the south of the city.[376] To the south, Liverpool is connected to Widnes and Warrington via the A562 and A5300 and across the River Mersey to Runcorn in Cheshire, via the Silver Jubilee and Mersey Gateway bridges. The M56 motorway then provides routes into parts of the neighbouring counties, with connections to the Wirral and North Wales, and a direct route to Manchester Airport.[377] The Kingsway and Queensway Tunnels connect Liverpool with the settlements on the Wirral Peninsula across the Mersey to the west, including Birkenhead, and Wallasey. The A41 road and M53 motorway, which both begin in Birkenhead, link to Cheshire and Shropshire and via the A55, to North Wales.[378] Liverpool is served by two separate rail networks. The local rail network is managed and run by Merseyrail and provides links throughout the Liverpool city region and beyond (see Local travel below). The national network, which is managed by Network Rail, provides Liverpool with connections to major towns and cities across England. The city's primary main line station is Lime Street station, which is the terminus for several lines into the city. The station is served by a number of different train operating companies including Avanti West Coast, East Midlands Railway, London North Eastern Railway, Northern Rail, TransPennine Express and West Midlands Trains.[380][381] Between them, the station is connected with direct train services to numerous destinations including London (in 2 hours 8 minutes with Pendolino trains), Birmingham, Glasgow, Hull, Leeds, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne, Norwich, Nottingham, Preston, Scarborough, Sheffield and York.[382][383][384][385] Opened in 1836, Lime Street station is the world's oldest mainline terminus station still in use.[386] In the south of the city, Liverpool South Parkway provides a connection to the city's airport. The Port of Liverpool connects passengers and freight to Liverpool from all around the world. Passenger ferry services depart from the city across the Irish Sea to Belfast and the Isle of Man. Services are provided by several companies, including the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, P&O Ferries and Stena Line. The Liverpool Cruise Terminal handles over 200,000 passengers and crew annually and is located alongside the Pier Head in the city centre. Berthing facilities for long-distance passenger cruises are provided and served by a large number of different cruise lines. Ports in Australia, France, Faroe Islands, Iceland, North America, Norway, Spain and the Caribbean are served by the facility.[387][388][389] The cruise lines that call at Liverpool cruise terminal include the following: As of 2022[update], the Port of Liverpool is the fourth busiest port in the UK by freight tonnage, handling 33 million tonnes of freight cargo.[409] It is the main port in the country for transatlantic trade and the largest port on the west coast of the UK. The Royal Seaforth and Liverpool2 container terminals are the port's two main terminals and handle a wide variety of cargo including containers, liquid and dry bulk cargoes such as coal and grain, biomass and roll-on/roll-off cargoes such as cars and trucks.[410][411][412][413][414][415] Leeds and Liverpool Canal runs into Liverpool city centre via Liverpool Canal Link at Pier Head since 2009.[416] Liverpool John Lennon Airport, which is located in the south of the city, provides Liverpool with direct air connections across the United Kingdom and Europe. It offers direct services to over 60 airports worldwide and to over 100 destinations via one-stop connections in Frankfurt, Dublin and Reykjavík. The airport is primarily served by low-cost airlines namely Aer Lingus, easyJet, Jet2.com, Loganair, Lufthansa, Play, Ryanair, Widerøe and Wizz Air, although it does provide facilities for private aircraft.[417][418][419][420][421] Liverpool's urban railway network, known as Merseyrail, is one of the busiest and most extensive in the country. The network provides approximately 30 million passenger journeys per year, across a system of 69 stations throughout Liverpool's metropolitan area, within the formal boundaries of the Liverpool city region and adjacent areas of Cheshire and Lancashire.[422][423][424][425] The network consists of three lines: the Northern Line, which runs to Southport, Ormskirk, Headbolt Lane and Hunts Cross; the Wirral Line, which runs through the Mersey Railway Tunnel and has branches to New Brighton, West Kirby, Chester and Ellesmere Port; and the City Line, which begins at Lime Street, providing links to St Helens, Wigan, Preston, Warrington and Manchester.[426][427] The network is predominantly electric and covers 75 miles (120 kilometres) of track.[428][429] Trains are owned and operated by the Merseyrail franchise and managed by Merseytravel under the direction of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority. Local services on the City Line are operated by Northern rather than Merseyrail, although the line itself remains part of the Merseyrail network. Within Liverpool city centre, four stations and over 6+1⁄2 miles (10.5 kilometres) of tunnels are underground.[428] Hamilton Square and Liverpool James Street are the oldest deep level underground stations in the world.[430] In 2023, for the first time in UK history, battery-powered passenger trains launched on Merseyrail tracks from the newly opened Headbolt Lane station in Kirkby. The Liverpool City Region Combined Authority's long term \"Merseyrail for All\" plan is to reduce dependency on live third rail and promote battery power in order to further expand Merseyrail to previously inaccessible places across the city region and as far as Manchester, Wrexham, Warrington and Preston.[431][432] Local bus services within and around Liverpool are managed by Merseytravel[433] and are run by several different companies, including Arriva and Stagecoach. The two principal termini for local buses are Queen Square bus station (located near Lime Street railway station) for services north and east of the city, and Liverpool One bus station (located near the Royal Albert Dock) for services to the south and east.[434] Cross-river services to the Wirral use roadside terminus points in Castle Street and Sir Thomas Street. A night bus service also operates on Saturdays providing services from the city centre across Liverpool and wider region.[435] Tour bus services are provided by Maghull Coaches which allow tourists to hop-on-hop-off and view historical landmarks and attractions, as well as Liverpool F.C. and Beatles related locations.[436][437] National Express services operate from the Liverpool One bus station to and from destinations across the UK.[438] In 2023, the Liverpool city region confirmed plans to become the second place outside London to implement bus franchising. Local leaders have argued that it will improve services by transferring control over fares, ticketing and routes from bus companies to the Combined Authority. The full implementation of bus franchising will take place by the end of 2028.[439][440] The cross-river ferry service in Liverpool, known as the Mersey Ferry, is managed and operated by Merseytravel, with services operating between the Pier Head in Liverpool city centre and both Woodside in Birkenhead and Seacombe in Wallasey. Services operate at intervals ranging from 20 minutes, at peak times, to every hour during the middle of the day and at weekends.[441] Despite remaining an important transport link between the city and the Wirral Peninsula, the Mersey Ferry has become an increasingly popular tourist attraction within the city, with daytime River Explorer Cruises providing passengers with an historical overview of the River Mersey and surrounding areas.[442] A scooter-sharing system and electric bicycle scheme operates throughout Liverpool which allows residents and visitors to move around the city on rented scooters and bicycles. The scheme is operated by Swedish technology company Voi, and riders are able to pick up and drop off bikes and scooters at various locations around the city.[443][444][445] National Cycle Route 56, National Cycle Route 62 and National Cycle Route 810 run through Liverpool. As with other large cities, Liverpool is an important cultural centre within the United Kingdom, incorporating music, performing arts, museums and art galleries, literature and nightlife among others. In 2008, the cultural heritage of the city was celebrated with the city holding the title of European Capital of Culture, during which time a wide range of cultural celebrations took place in the city, including Go Superlambananas! and La Princesse. Liverpool has also held Europe's largest music and poetry event, the Welsh national Eisteddfod, three times, despite being in England, in 1884, 1900, and 1929. Liverpool is internationally known for music and is recognised by Guinness World Records as the \"World Capital City of Pop\".[447] Musicians from the city have produced 58 No. 1 singles, more than any other city in the world.[448] Both the most successful male band and girl group in global music history have contained Liverpudlian members. Liverpool is most famous as the birthplace of the Beatles and during the 1960s was at the forefront of the Beat Music movement, which would eventually lead to the British Invasion. Many notable musicians of the time originated in the city including Billy J. Kramer, Cilla Black, Gerry and the Pacemakers and The Searchers. The influence of musicians from Liverpool, coupled with other cultural exploits of the time, such as the Liverpool poets, prompted American poet Allen Ginsberg to proclaim that the city was \"the centre of consciousness of the human universe\".[449] Other musicians from Liverpool include Billy Fury, A Flock of Seagulls, Echo & the Bunnymen, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Frankie Vaughan, Anathema, Ladytron, The Zutons, Cast, Atomic Kitten and Rebecca Ferguson. The La's 1990 hit single \"There She Goes\" was described by Rolling Stone as a \"founding piece of Britpop's foundation.\"[450] The city is also home to the oldest surviving professional symphony orchestra in the UK, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, which is based in the Philharmonic Hall.[451] The chief conductor of the orchestra is Vasily Petrenko.[452] Sir Edward Elgar dedicated his Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1 to the Liverpool Orchestral Society, and the piece had its first performance in the city in 1901.[453] Among Liverpool's curiosities, the Austrian émigré Fritz Spiegl is notable. He not only became a world expert on the etymology of Scouse, but composed the music to Z-cars and the Radio 4 UK Theme. Well established festivals in the city include Africa Oyé and Brazilica which are the UK's largest free African and Brazilian music festivals respectively.[454][455] The dance music festival Creamfields was established by the Liverpool-based Cream clubbing brand which started life as a weekly event at Nation nightclub. There are numerous music venues located across the city, however, the Liverpool Arena is by far the largest. Opened in 2008, the 11,000-seat arena hosted the MTV Europe Music Awards the same year, and since then has played host to world-renowned acts such as Andrea Bocelli, Beyoncé, Elton John, Kanye West, Kasabian, The Killers, Lady Gaga, Oasis, Pink, Rihanna, and UB40. On 7 October 2022, the [[publisherBBCrporation and the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) announced that Liverpool would host the Eurovision Song Contest 2023 on behalf of the previous year's winning country Ukraine, which was unable to meet the demands of hosting the event due to security concerns caused by the Russian invasion of the country. The contest was held at Liverpool Arena, and consisted of two semi-finals on 9 and 11 May and a final on 13 May 2023. This was the first time that the contest took place in the city, and was also a record-extending ninth time that the UK has hosted the contest, having last done so in Birmingham in 1998.[456] Liverpool has more galleries and national museums than any other city in the United Kingdom apart from London.[11] National Museums Liverpool is the only English national collection based wholly outside London.[457] The Tate Liverpool gallery houses the modern art collection of the Tate in the North of England and was, until the opening of Tate Modern, the largest exhibition space dedicated to modern art in the United Kingdom. The FACT centre hosts touring multimedia exhibitions, while the Walker Art Gallery houses one of the most impressive permanent collections of Pre-Raphaelite art in the world.[458] Sudley House contains another major collection of pre-20th-century art.[459] Liverpool University's Victoria Building was re-opened as a public art gallery and museum to display the university's artwork and historical collections which include the largest display of art by Audubon outside the US.[460] A number of artists have also come from the city, including painter George Stubbs who was born in Liverpool in 1724. The Liverpool Biennial festival of arts runs from mid-September to late November and comprises three main sections; the International, The Independents and New Contemporaries although fringe events are timed to coincide.[461] It was during the 2004 festival that Yoko Ono's work \"My mummy was beautiful\" invited controversy when photographs of a woman's breast and crotch were exhibited on the main shopping street.[462] Felicia Hemans (née Browne) was born in Dale Street, Liverpool, in 1793, although she later moved to Flintshire, in Wales. Felicia was born in Liverpool, a granddaughter of the Venetian consul in that city. Her father's business soon brought the family to Denbighshire in North Wales, where she spent her youth. They made their home near Abergele and St. Asaph (Flintshire), and it is clear that she came to regard herself as Welsh by adoption, later referring to Wales as \"Land of my childhood, my home and my dead\". Her first poems, dedicated to the Prince of Wales, were published in Liverpool in 1808, when she was only fourteen, arousing the interest of Percy Bysshe Shelley, who briefly corresponded with her. [463] An engraving of a painting of The Wishing Gate. by S. F. Serres was published in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1834 with a poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon to which she adds the note 'I believe that to this haunted gate, a common superstition is attached, namely, that to wish, and to have that wish fulfilled, is the result of such wish being uttered while passing'. It stood on the North Shore before the docks were built and was a place where farewells could be waved to departing voyagers.[464] A number of notable authors have visited Liverpool, including Daniel Defoe, Washington Irving, Charles Dickens, Thomas De Quincey, Herman Melville, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Gerard Manley Hopkins and Hugh Walpole. Defoe, after visiting the city, described it, as \"one of the wonders of Britain in his 'Tour through England and Wales'\".[465] Melville's novel Redburn deals with the first seagoing voyage of 19 years old Wellingborough Redburn between New York and Liverpool in 1839. Largely autobiographical, the middle sections of the book are set in Liverpool and describe the young merchantman's wanderings, and his reflections.[463] From 1842 to 1869, Dickens visited the city to give public readings of his novels.[466] Hawthorne was stationed in Liverpool as United States consul between 1853 and 1856.[467] Hopkins served as priest at St Francis Xavier Church, Langdale St., Liverpool, between 1879 and 81.[468] Although he is not known to have ever visited Liverpool, Jung famously had a vivid dream of the city which he analysed in one of his works.[469] Her Benny, a novel telling the tragic story of Liverpool street urchins in the 1870s, written by Methodist preacher Silas K. Hocking, was a best-seller and the first book to sell a million copies in the author's lifetime.[470] The prolific writer of adventure novels, Harold Edward Bindloss (1866–1945), was born in Liverpool. The writer, docker and political activist George Garrett was born in Seacombe, on the Wirral Peninsula in 1896 and was brought up in Liverpool's South end, around Park Road, the son of a fierce Liverpool–Irish Catholic mother and a staunch 'Orange' stevedore father. In the 1920s and 1930s, his organisation within the Seamen's Vigilance Committees, unemployed demonstrations, and hunger marches from Liverpool became part of a wider cultural force. He spoke at reconciliation meetings in sectarian Liverpool, and helped found the Unity Theatre in the 1930s as part of the Popular Front against the rise of fascism, particularly its echoes in the Spanish Civil War. Garrett died in 1966.[471] The novelist and playwright James Hanley (1897–1985) was born in Kirkdale, Liverpool, in 1897 (not Dublin, nor 1901 as he generally implied) to a working-class family.[472] Hanley grew up close to the docks and much of his early writing is about seamen. The Furys (1935) is first in a sequence of five loosely autobiographical novels about working-class life in Liverpool. James Hanley's brother, novelist Gerald Hanley (1916–92) was also born in Liverpool (not County Cork, Ireland, as he claimed).[473] While he published a number of novels he also wrote radio plays for the BBC as well as some film scripts, most notably The Blue Max (1966).[474] He was also one of several scriptwriters for a life of Gandhi (1964).[475] Novelist Beryl Bainbridge (1932–2010) was born in Liverpool and raised in nearby Formby. She was primarily known for her works of psychological fiction, often set among the English working classes. Bainbridge won the Whitbread Awards prize for best novel in 1977 and 1996 and was nominated five times for the Booker Prize. The Times newspaper named Bainbridge among their list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\".[476] J. G. Farrell was born in Liverpool in 1935 but left at the outbreak of war in 1939.[477] A novelist of Irish descent, Farrell gained prominence for his historical fiction, most notably his Empire Trilogy (Troubles, The Siege of Krishnapur and The Singapore Grip), dealing with the political and human consequences of British colonial rule. However, his career ended when he drowned in Ireland in 1979 at the age of 44. Helen Forrester was the pen name of June Bhatia (née Huband) (1919–2011),[478][479] who was known for her books about her early childhood in Liverpool during the Great Depression, including Twopence to Cross the Mersey (1974), as well as several works of fiction. During the late 1960s the city became well known for the Liverpool poets, who include Roger McGough and the late Adrian Henri. An anthology of poems, The Mersey Sound, written by Henri, McGough and Brian Patten, has sold well since it was first being published in 1967. Liverpool has produced several noted writers of horror fiction, often set on Merseyside – Ramsey Campbell, Clive Barker and Peter Atkins among them. A collection of Liverpudlian horror fiction, Spook City was edited by a Liverpool expatriate, Angus Mackenzie, and introduced by Doug Bradley, also from Liverpool.[480] Bradley is famed for portraying Barker's creation Pinhead in the Hellraiser series of films. Liverpool also has a long history of performing arts, reflected in several annual theatre festivals such as the Liverpool Shakespeare Festival, which takes place inside Liverpool Cathedral and in the adjacent historic St James' Gardens every summer; the Everyword Festival of new theatre writing, the only one of its kind in the country;[481] Physical Fest, an international festival of physical theatre;[482] the annual festivals organised by Liverpool John Moores University's drama department and the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts; and other festivals by the large number of theatres in the city, such as the Empire, Everyman,[483][484] Playhouse,[485][486] Royal Court, and Unity theatres. Notable actors and actresses from Liverpool include Arthur Askey, Tom Baker, Kim Cattrall, Jodie Comer, Stephen Graham, Rex Harrison, Jason Isaacs, Tina Malone, the McGann brothers (Joe, Mark, Paul, and Stephen), David Morrissey, Elizabeth Morton, Peter Serafinowicz, Elisabeth Sladen, Alison Steadman, and Rita Tushingham. Actors and actresses from elsewhere in the world have strong ties to the city, such as Canadian actor Mike Myers (whose parents were both from Liverpool) and American actress Halle Berry (whose mother was from Liverpool). Liverpool has a thriving and varied nightlife. The majority of the city's late-night restaurants, bars, pubs, nightclubs, music venues and comedy clubs are located in a number of distinct districts. In 2023, figures from global data company Square show that night-time spending in bars and restaurants in Liverpool city centre outperformed all major UK cities, including London.[487] Figures by the Liverpool BID Company suggest that the busiest nights of the week in Liverpool city centre are Friday and Saturday. Using cameras to track the flow of people in key locations between 7 pm and 4 am, at least 1.5 million people pass through the city centre every Friday night and almost 2 million people on Saturday nights. The data demonstrates that Monday night is the quietest night of the week in the city centre and footfall then increases every single night to reach its peak on Saturday nights. 125,889 people worked in the city's night time economy as of 2022, according to the Liverpool BID Company.[488][489][490] Liverpool's nightlife is concentrated in a number of districts including Ropewalks which comprises Concert Square, St. Peter's Square and the adjoining Seel Street and Duke Street. Other popular areas include Hardman Street, the Cavern Quarter, Baltic Triangle, Royal Albert Dock and the city's Pride Quarter, which is home to a large number of LGBT venues.[491][492] In the city's suburbs, Lark Lane in Aigburth is noted for an abundance of bars and late-night venues.[493][494] In Liverpool primary and secondary education is available in various forms supported by the state including secular, Church of England, Jewish, and Roman Catholic. Islamic education is available at primary level, but there is no secondary provision. One of Liverpool's important early schools was The Liverpool Blue Coat School; founded in 1708 as a charitable school. It is now a state grammar school. The Liverpool Blue Coat School is the top-performing school in the city with 100% 5 or more A*-C grades at GCSE resulting in the 30th best GCSE results in the country and an average point score per student of 1087.4 in A/AS levels.[495] Other notable schools include Liverpool College founded in 1840 Merchant Taylors' School founded in 1620.[496] Another of Liverpool's notable senior schools is St. Edward's College situated in the West Derby area of the city. Historic grammar schools, such as the Liverpool Institute High School and Liverpool Collegiate School—both closed in the 1980s—are still remembered as centres of academic excellence. Bellerive Catholic College is the city's top-performing non-selective school, based upon GCSE results in 2007. Liverpool has three universities: the University of Liverpool, Liverpool John Moores University and Liverpool Hope University. Edge Hill University, founded as a teacher-training college in the Edge Hill district of Liverpool, is now located in Ormskirk in South-West Lancashire. Liverpool is also home to the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts (LIPA). The University of Liverpool was established in 1881 as University College Liverpool. In 1884, it became part of the federal Victoria University. Following a Royal Charter and Act of Parliament in 1903, it became an independent university, the University of Liverpool, with the right to confer its own degrees. It was the first university to offer degrees in biochemistry, architecture, civic design, veterinary science, oceanography and social science. Liverpool Hope University, which was formed through the merger of three colleges, the earliest of which was founded in 1844, gained university status in 2005. It is the only ecumenical university in Europe.[497] It is situated on both sides of Taggart Avenue in Childwall and has a second campus in the city centre (the Cornerstone). The Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, founded to address some of the problems created by trade, continues today as a post-graduate school affiliated with the University of Liverpool and houses an anti-venom repository. Liverpool John Moores University was previously a polytechnic, and gained status in 1992. It is named in honour of Sir John Moores, one of the founders of the Littlewoods football pools and retail group, who was a major benefactor. The institution was previously owned and run by Liverpool City Council. It traces it lineage to the Liverpool Mechanics' institute, opened in 1823, making it by this measure England's third-oldest university. The city has one further education college, City of Liverpool College in the city centre. Liverpool City Council operates Burton Manor, a residential adult education college in nearby Burton, on the Wirral Peninsula. There are two Jewish schools in Liverpool, both belonging to the King David Foundation. King David School, Liverpool, is the High School and the King David Primary School. There is also a King David Kindergarten, featured in the community centre of Harold House. These schools are all run by the King David Foundation located in Harold House in Childwall; conveniently next door to the Childwall Synagogue. Liverpool is one of the most successful footballing cities in England, and is home to two top flight Premier League teams. Everton F.C. was founded in 1878 and was one of the twelve founder members of the Football League. It plays at Goodison Park. Liverpool F.C. were founded in 1892 and play at Anfield. Between them, the clubs have won 28 English First Division titles, 12 FA Cup titles, 10 League Cup titles, 6 European Cup titles, 1 FIFA Club World Cup title, 1 European Cup Winners' Cup title, 3 UEFA Cup titles, and 24 FA Charity Shields. The two clubs contest the Merseyside derby, dubbed the 'friendly derby'. Despite the name the fixture is known for its keen rivalry, having seen more sending-offs in this fixture than any other. Unlike many other derbies it is not rare for families in the city to contain supporters of both clubs.[498] Liverpool F.C. is the English and British club with the most European Cup titles with six, the latest in 2019. Liverpool has played at Anfield since 1892, when the club was formed to occupy the stadium following Everton's departure due to a dispute with their landlord. Liverpool are still playing there 125 years later, although the ground has been completely rebuilt since the 1970s. The Spion Kop (rebuilt as an all-seater stand in 1994–95) was the most famous part of the ground, gaining cult status across the world due to the songs and celebrations of the many fans who packed onto its terraces. Anfield as capacity for 54,000 spectators in comfort and is a distinctive landmark in an area filled with smaller and older buildings. Liverpool club also has a multimillion-pound youth training facility called The Academy. After leaving Anfield in 1892, Everton moved to Goodison Park on the opposite side of Stanley Park. The ground was opened on 24 August 1892, by Lord Kinnaird and Frederick Wall of the FA but the first crowds to attend the ground saw a short athletics meeting followed by a selection of music and a fireworks display. Everton's first game there was on 2 September 1892 when they beat Bolton 4–2. It was one of the host venues during the 1966 FIFA World Cup. It now has the capacity for just under 40,000 spectators all-seated, but the last expansion took place in 1994 when a new Park End Stand gave the stadium an all-seater capacity. The Goodison Road Stand dates back to the 1970s, while the Gwladys Street Stand and Bullens Road Stand are refurbished pre-Second World War structures. Everton is currently in the process of relocating, with a stadium move first mooted as early as 1996.[499] In 2003, the club were forced to abandon plans for a 55,000-seat stadium at King's Dock due to financial constraints,[500] with further proposed moves to Kirkby (comprising part of Destination Kirkby, moving the stadium just beyond Liverpool's council boundary into Kirkby) and Walton Hall Park similarly scrapped. The club will relocate to the multimillion-pound Everton Stadium designed by the American architect Dan Meis at the nearby Bramley-Moore Dock on the River Mersey waterfront during the 2025/26 season, with ground broken on the project in August 2021.[501] The new stadium will have a capacity of 52,888 which could be expanded to 62,000 demand permitting and it will be a host venue for the UEFA Euro 2028. Everton also have a multimillion-pound training facility based at Finch Farm. The Everton Women's Team play in the Women's Super League at the Walton Hall Park Stadium. Boxing is massively popular in Liverpool. The city has a proud heritage and history in the sport and is home to around 22 amateur boxing clubs, which are responsible for producing many successful boxers, such as Nel Tarleton, Alan Rudkin, John Conteh, Andy Holligan, Liam Smith, Paul Hodkinson, Tony Bellew and Robin Ried. The city also boasts a consistently strong amateur contingent which is highlighted by Liverpool being the most represented city on the GB Boxing team, as well as at the 2012 London Olympics, the most notable Liverpool amateur fighters include; Jimmy Lloyd, George Turpin, Tony Willis, Robin Reid and David Price who have all medalled at the Olympic Games. Boxing events are usually hosted at the Echo Arena and Liverpool Olympia within the city, although the former home of Liverpool boxing was the renowned Liverpool Stadium. Aintree Racecourse in the adjacent Metropolitan Borough of Sefton is home to the world's most famous steeple-chase, the Randox Grand National which takes place annually in early April. The race meeting attracts horse owners/ jockeys from around the world to compete in the demanding 4-mile (6.5-kilometre) and 30-fence course. There have been many memorable moments of the Grand National, for instance, the 100/1 outsider Foinavon in 1967, the dominant Red Rum and Ginger McCain of the 1970s and Mon Mome (100/1) who won the 2009 meeting. In 2010, the National became the first horse race to be televised in high-definition in the UK. The Royal Liverpool Golf Club, situated in the nearby town of Hoylake on the Wirral Peninsula, has hosted The Open Championship on a number of occasions, most recently in 2023. It also hosted the Walker Cup in 1983. Liverpool once contained four greyhound tracks, Seaforth Greyhound Stadium (1933–1965), Breck Park Stadium (1927–1948), Stanley Greyhound Stadium (1927–1961) and White City Stadium (1932–1973). Breck Park also hosted boxing bouts and both Stanley and Seaforth hosted Motorcycle speedway. Wavertree Sports Park is home to the Liverpool Harriers athletics club, which has produced such athletes as Curtis Robb, Allyn Condon (the only British athlete to compete at both the Summer and Winter Olympics), and Katarina Johnson-Thompson; Great Britain was represented by Johnson-Thompson at the 2012 London Olympics in the women's heptathlon, and she would go on to win the gold medal at the 2019 World Championships, giving Liverpool its first gold medal and breaking the British record in the process. In August 2012, Liverpool gymnast Beth Tweddle won an Olympic bronze medal in London 2012 in the uneven bars at her third Olympic Games, thus becoming the most decorated British gymnast in history. Park Road Gymnastics Centre provides training to a high level. Liverpool has produced several swimmers who have represented their nation at major championships such as the Olympic Games. The most notable of which is Steve Parry who claimed a bronze medal at the 2004 Athens Olympics in the 200m butterfly. Others include Herbert Nickel Haresnape, Margaret Kelly, Shellagh Ratcliffe and Austin Rawlinson. There is a purpose-built aquatics centre at Wavertree Sports Park, which opened in 2008. The City of Liverpool Swimming Club has been National Speedo League Champions 8 out of the last 11 years. The city is the hub of the Liverpool and District Cricket Competition, an ECB Premier League.[502] Sefton Park and Liverpool are the league's founder members based in the city with Wavertree, Alder and Old Xaverians clubs having joined the league more recently.[503] Liverpool plays host Lancashire County Cricket Club as an outground most seasons, including six of eight home County Championship games during Lancashire's 2011[504] title winning campaign[505] while Old Trafford was refurbished.[506][507] Since 2014 Liverpool Cricket Club has played host[508] to the annual Tradition-ICAP Liverpool International tennis tournament, which has seen tennis stars such as Novak Djokovic, David Ferrer, Mardy Fish, Laura Robson and Caroline Wozniacki. Previously this had been held at Calderstones Park, situated in Allerton in the south of the city. Liverpool Tennis Development Programme at Wavertree Tennis Centre is one of the largest in the UK. Professional basketball came to the city in 2007 with the entry of Everton Tigers, later known as Mersey Tigers, into the elite British Basketball League. The club was originally associated with Everton F.C., and was part of the Toxteth Tigers youth development programme, which reached over 1,500 young people every year.[509] The Tigers began to play in Britain's top league for the 2007–08 season, playing at the Greenbank Sports Academy before moving into the newly completed Echo Arena during that season. After the 2009–10 season, Everton F.C. withdrew funding from the Tigers, who then changed their name to Mersey Tigers. The club were expelled from the British Basketball League in 2013 due to financial problems.[510] Liverpool is one of three cities which still host the traditional sport of British baseball and it hosts the annual England-Wales international match every two years, alternating with Cardiff and Newport. Liverpool Trojans are the oldest existing baseball club in the UK. The 2014 Tour of Britain cycle race began in Liverpool on 7 September, using a city centre circuit to complete 130 km (80.8 mi) of racing.[511] The Tour of Britain took nine stages and finished in London on 14 September. A 2016 study of UK fitness centres found that, of the top 20 UK urban areas, Liverpool had the highest number of leisure and sports centres per capita, with 4.3 centres per 100,000 of the city population.[512] The city has one daily newspaper: the Echo, published by Reach plc. The Liverpool Daily Post was also published until 2013. The UK's first online only weekly newspaper called Southport Reporter (Southport and Mersey Reporter), is also one of the many other news outlets that cover the city. The independent media organisation The Post[513] also covers Liverpool, while Nerve magazine publishes articles and reviews of cultural events. Liverpool TV is a local television station serving Liverpool City Region and surrounding areas. The station is owned and operated by Made Television Ltd and forms part of a group of eight local TV stations. It broadcasts from studios and offices in Liverpool. The ITV region which covers Liverpool is ITV Granada. In 2006, the Television company opened a new newsroom in the Royal Liver Building. Granada's regional news broadcasts were produced at the Royal Albert Dock News Centre during the 1980s and 1990s.[514] The BBC also opened a new newsroom on Hanover Street in 2006. ITV's daily magazine programme This Morning was broadcast from studios at Royal Albert Dock until 1996, when production was moved to London. Granada's short-lived shopping channel \"Shop!\" was also produced in Liverpool until it was cancelled in 2002.[515] Liverpool is the home of the TV production company Lime Pictures, formerly Mersey Television, which produced the now-defunct soap operas Brookside and Grange Hill. It also produces the soap opera Hollyoaks, which was formerly filmed in Chester and began on Channel 4 in 1995. All three series were/are largely filmed in the Childwall area of Liverpool. Radio stations include BBC Radio Merseyside, Hits Radio Liverpool, Greatest Hits Radio, Capital Liverpool, In Demand Radio, Liverpool Live Radio,[516] and Melodic Distraction.[517] Hits Radio and Greatest Hits Radio are owned by Bauer and located in St Johns Beacon which, along with the two cathedrals, dominates the city's skyline. Liverpool has also featured in films;[518] see List of films set in Liverpool for some of them. In films the city has \"doubled\" for London, Paris, New York, Chicago, Moscow, Dublin, Venice and Berlin.[43][519] Liverpool is twinned[522] with: Liverpool has friendship links (without formal constitution)[523] with the following cities: The first overseas consulate of the United States was opened in Liverpool in 1790, and it remained operational for almost two centuries.[524] Today, a large number of consulates are located in the city serving Chile, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Romania, Sweden and Thailand. Tunisian & Ivory Coast Consulates are located in the neighbouring Metropolitan Borough of Sefton. The following people and military units have received the Freedom of the City of Liverpool.",

                "title": "Scouse - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Scouse (/skaʊs/ skowss), more formally known as Liverpool English[2] or Merseyside English,[3][4][5] is an accent and dialect of English associated with the city of Liverpool and the surrounding Liverpool City Region. The Scouse accent is highly distinctive as it was influenced heavily by Irish and Welsh immigrants who arrived via the Liverpool docks, as well as Scandinavian sailors who also used the docks,[6] and thus has very little in common with the accents found throughout the rest of England.[7] People from Liverpool are known as Liverpudlians, but are usually called Scousers; the name comes from scouse, a stew originating from Scandinavian lobscouse eaten by sailors and locals.[8][9][10][11] The development of Liverpool since the 1950s has spread the accent into nearby areas such as the towns of Runcorn and Skelmersdale.[12] Variations within Scouse have been noted: the accent of Liverpool's city centre and northern neighbourhoods is usually described as fast, harsh, and nasal,[13] while the \"Beatles-like\" accent found in the southern suburbs of Liverpool is typically referred to as slow, soft, and dark.[14] Popular colloquialisms have shown a growing deviation from the historical Lancashire dialect that was previously found in Liverpool,[12] as well as a growth in the influence of the accent in the wider area.[7][15][16][17][18] Scouse is often considered by other Britons to be one of the country's least popular accents due to its difficulty, but it conversely also performs very well in polls of British accents that people perceive as happy and friendly.[19] The word scouse is a shortened form of lobscouse, the origin of which is uncertain.[20] It is related to the Norwegian lapskaus, Swedish lapskojs, and Danish labskovs (skipperlabskovs), as well as the Low German labskaus and refers to a stew of the same name commonly eaten by sailors. In the 19th century, poorer people in Liverpool, Birkenhead, Bootle and Wallasey commonly ate scouse as it was a cheap dish and familiar to the families of seafarers. Outsiders tended to call these people \"scousers\".[21] In The Lancashire Dictionary of Dialect, Tradition and Folklore, Alan Crosby suggested that the word only became known nationwide with the popularity of the BBC sitcom Till Death Us Do Part (1965–1975), which featured a Liverpudlian socialist and a Cockney conservative in a regular argument.[10] Originally a small fishing village, Liverpool developed as a port. After the 1700s, it developed into a major international trading and industrial centre. The city consequently became a melting pot of several accents and dialects as sailors and traders from different areas (specifically Wales and Ireland) established themselves in the area. Until the mid-19th century, the dominant local accent was similar to that of neighbouring areas of Lancashire. For instance, the comedian and actor Robb Wilton (1881–1957), despite coming from the Everton district of Liverpool, spoke with a dry Lancashire accent rather than a Scouse accent.[22][better source needed] The influence of immigrants from Ireland (especially Dublin) and Northern Wales, as well as visiting Scandinavian sailors, contributed to a distinctive local Liverpool accent.[23][24] The first reference to a distinctive Liverpool accent was in 1890. Linguist Gerald Knowles suggested that the accent's nasal quality may have derived from poor public health in the 19th century, by which the prevalence of colds among many people over a long time resulted in a nasal accent coming to be regarded as the norm and copied by newer incomers learning the dialect of the local area.[25] Scousers tend to speak at a higher pitch than most other English speakers, sometimes approaching falsetto. The Victorian phonetician Alexander John Ellis said that Liverpool and Birkenhead \"had no dialect proper\", as he conceived of dialects as speech that had been passed down through generations from the earliest English speakers. Ellis did research some locations on the Wirral, but these respondents spoke in the traditional Cheshire dialect at the time and not in Scouse.[26] The 1950s Survey of English Dialects recorded traditional Lancastrian dialect from the town of Halewood, finding no trace of Scouse influence. The phonetician John C. Wells wrote that \"the Scouse accent might as well not exist\" in The Linguistic Atlas of England, which was the Survey's principal output.[27] An academic study of Scouse was undertaken by Gerald Knowles at the University of Leeds in 1973. He identified a key problem: that traditional dialect research had focused on developments from a single proto-language, but Scouse (and many other urban dialects) had resulted from interactions between an unknown number of languages.[28] The phonemic notation used in this article is based on the set of symbols used by Watson (2007). Scouse is highly distinguishable from other English dialects. Because of this international recognition, Keith Szlamp made a request to IANA on 16 September 1996 to make it a recognised Internet dialect.[47] After citing a number of references,[48][49][50][51][11] the application was accepted on 25 May 2000 and now allows Internet documents that use the dialect to be categorised as Scouse by using the language tag \"en-Scouse\". Scouse has also become well-known globally as the accent of the Beatles.[52] While the members of the band are famously from Liverpool,[53] their accents have more in common with the older Lancashire-like Liverpool dialect found in the southern suburbs; the accent has evolved into Scouse since the 1960s. Other northern English dialects include:",

Liverpool, a city and seaport in northwestern England, forms an irregular crescent along the north shore of the Mersey estuary a few miles from the Irish Sea. It is the nucleus of the metropolitan county of Merseyside in the historic county of Lancashire. The location that became the city of Liverpool was granted a charter for a planned new town by King John of England in 1207. In 1830 the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, the first in England to link two major cities, was opened. A rail network providing easy and cheap access to all major British industrial centers was soon created. All four of the Beatles—John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr—were born and started their musical careers in Liverpool. Liverpool, city and seaport, northwestern England, forming the nucleus of the metropolitan county of Merseyside in the historic county of Lancashire. The city proper, which is a metropolitan borough of Merseyside, forms an irregular crescent along the north shore of the Mersey estuary a few miles from the Irish Sea. The first significant date in the history of Liverpool is 1207, when King John of England granted a charter for a planned new town there. The town’s medieval growth was slow, but in the 18th century it expanded rapidly as a result of profitable trade with the Americas and the West Indies and became the second most important port in Britain. A major element in the general trading pattern was the Liverpool Triangle—the exchange of manufactured goods from the Mersey hinterland for slaves in West Africa who were in turn traded for sugar, molasses, spices, and other plantation crops in the West Indies. The first dock in Liverpool was built in 1715. By the end of the century, four other docks had been established along the Mersey, so that the port outranked even London in dock space. In 1830 the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, the first in England to link two major cities, was opened. A rail network providing easy and cheap access to all major British industrial centres was soon created, and steam ferry links between Liverpool and the Wirral, across the Mersey estuary, were established. This growth was accompanied by high levels of immigration from surrounding areas and from Ireland, especially during and after the Irish Potato Famine (1845–49). By the beginning of the 20th century, Liverpool had become the centre of 7 miles (11 km) of docks extending along the Mersey from Hornby (1884) in the north to Herculaneum (1866) in the south. Additional improvements were made to the docks, but after World War II Liverpool declined as an exporting and passenger port. That change can be attributed mainly to the decreasing significance, in the economic life of Britain, of Liverpool’s industrial hinterland and its traditional trade with the United States and West Africa. Low capital investment and unemployment in the docks intensified the situation. Liverpool continues to exert a great degree of dominance over the surrounding metropolitan region. Although the traditional activities of transport, communication, distribution, and shipping have declined, they are still important in the economic life of the city. The port, in addition to handling general cargo, has developed as a major facility for containerized shipping, and in 2012 it became a terminus for cruise ships. The docklands and several areas of the historic centre of the city collectively were named a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2004. However, that designation was rescinded in 2021 because of developments that have caused “the irreversible loss of attributes.” Paramount among Liverpool’s important contributions to 20th-century popular culture were the Beatles, who emerged from the Cavern (a nightclub that was part of the city’s musical scene in the 1960s) to become the world’s best-known rock group. Local “performance” poets such as Roger McGough, Adrian Henri, and Brian Patten helped popularize poetry in the 1960s. And from the heyday of the music hall to the radio comedy of Tommy Handley in the 1940s, Liverpudlians contributed to the British comedy tradition. Tourism has grown in importance and includes a rise in interest for visiting locations associated with the Beatles. Architectural landmarks include the 18th-century Town Hall and the 19th-century St. George’s Hall; the Neo-Gothic Anglican cathedral, founded in 1904 and completed in 1978; and the Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral (1967), of strikingly modern design. Tate Liverpool (a branch of the national Tate galleries), Merseyside County Museum and Library, the Walker Art Gallery, the Picton Library, the International Slave Museum, and the University of Liverpool (chartered 1881) are among the many cultural institutions. Liverpool also has a well-known symphony orchestra, and the city is home to two world-class professional football (soccer) teams (Everton and Liverpool FC). Area 43 square miles (112 square km). Pop.

                "content": "The Cleveland Cavaliers, often referred to as the Cavs, are an American professional basketball team based in Cleveland. The Cavaliers compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Central Division of the Eastern Conference. The team began play as an expansion team in 1970, along with the Portland Trail Blazers and Buffalo Braves. Home games were first held at Cleveland Arena from 1970 to 1974, followed by the Richfield Coliseum from 1974 to 1994. Since 1994, the Cavs have played home games at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in downtown Cleveland, which is shared with the Cleveland Monsters of the American Hockey League. Dan Gilbert has owned the team since March 2005. The Cavaliers opened their inaugural season by losing their first 15 games and struggled in their early years, placing no better than sixth in the Eastern Conference during their first five seasons. The team won their first Central Division title in 1976, which also marked the first winning season and playoff appearance in franchise history, where they advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals. The franchise was purchased by Ted Stepien in 1980. Stepien's tenure as owner was marked by six coaching changes, questionable trades and draft decisions, and poor attendance, leading to $15 million in financial losses. The Cavs went 66–180 over the course of those three seasons and endured a 24-game losing streak spanning the 1981–82 and 1982–83 seasons. George and Gordon Gund purchased the franchise in 1983. During the latter half of the 1980s and through much of the 1990s, the Cavs were a regular playoff contender – led by players such as Mark Price and Brad Daugherty – and advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals in 1992. After the team's playoff appearance in the 1997–98 season, however, the Cavs had six consecutive losing seasons with no playoff action. Cleveland was awarded with the top overall pick in the 2003 draft, and they selected LeBron James. Behind James and Zydrunas Ilgauskas, the Cavaliers again became a regular playoff contender by 2005. They made their first appearance in the NBA Finals in 2007 after winning the first Eastern Conference championship in franchise history. After failing to return to the NBA Finals in the ensuing three seasons, James joined the Miami Heat in 2010. As a result, the Cavaliers finished the 2010–11 season last in the conference, enduring a 26-game losing streak, the third-longest in NBA history. Between 2010 and 2014, however, the team won the top pick in the NBA draft lottery three times – first in 2011 where they selected Kyrie Irving, and again in 2013 and 2014. After four seasons with the Heat and having won back-to-back titles in the 2011–12 and 2012–13 seasons, James returned to the Cavs in 2014 and led the team to four straight NBA Finals appearances. In 2016, the Cavaliers won their first NBA Championship, marking Cleveland's first major sports title since 1964. The 2016 NBA Finals victory over the Golden State Warriors marked the first time in Finals history a team had come back to win the series after trailing, 3–1. The Cavaliers have 23 playoff appearances and have won seven Central Division titles, five Eastern Conference titles and one NBA title. The Cavaliers began play in the 1970–71 season as an expansion team.[9] They set losing records in each of their first five seasons before winning their first division title in 1976.[10][11][12][13][14][15][16] The 1976 team was led by Austin Carr, Bobby \"Bingo\" Smith, Jim Chones, Dick Snyder, Nate Thurmond and head coach Bill Fitch.[17] It was remembered for the \"Miracle at Richfield\", in which the Cavaliers defeated the Washington Bullets, 4–3, in the Eastern Conference Semifinals.[18] They won Game 7, 87–85, on a shot by Snyder with four seconds to go.[18] The Cavaliers moved on to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time,[18] but were without Chones after he broke his toe before the series opener.[19] As a result, the Cavaliers went on to lose, 4–2, to the Boston Celtics.[20] They made playoff appearances in the following two seasons before a six-year playoff drought.[21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28] The early 1980s were marked by Ted Stepien's ownership. During Stepien's tenure, the Cavaliers made a practice of trading future draft picks for marginal veteran players.[29] His most notable deal sent a 1982 first-round pick to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for Don Ford and the 22nd overall pick in 1980.[30] As a result of Stepien's dealings, the NBA introduced the \"Stepien Rule\", which prohibits teams from trading first-round draft picks in successive seasons.[29][31] The Cavaliers went 66–180, dropped to the bottom of the league in attendance and lost $15 million during Stepien's three years as the owner.[29] The Cavs went through six coaches during this span, including four during the 1981–82 season.[29] The team finished 15–67, and between March and November 1982, the team had a 24-game losing streak, which, at the time, was the NBA's longest losing streak.[32][33][34][35][36] George and Gordon Gund purchased the Cavaliers from Stepien in 1983.[31][37] The Cavaliers made the playoffs 10 times between 1985 and 1998.[38] The 1988–89 seasons was the Cavaliers' best season to date, finishing the regular season at 57–25 with a team that included Brad Daugherty, Mark Price, Ron Harper and Larry Nance, and head coach Lenny Wilkens.[38][39] They had their second 57-win season in 1991–92 and reached the Eastern Conference Finals that year.[38][40] However, between 1999 and 2005, the Cavaliers failed to make a playoff appearance.[38] The Cavaliers finished the 2002–03 season 17–65, tied for the worst record in the NBA.[41] The Cavaliers had the No. 1 pick in the 2003 NBA draft, selecting future NBA MVP LeBron James, a native of nearby Akron.[42] On January 3, 2005, the team was sold to businessman Dan Gilbert for $375 million,[43][44][45] and the deal was finalized on March 1, 2005.[46] That year, the team also hired head coach Mike Brown and general manager Danny Ferry.[47] The Cavaliers built a team around James and Žydrūnas Ilgauskas by adding players such as Drew Gooden, Larry Hughes and Anderson Varajao.[48][49] Under this new leadership, the Cavaliers made five straight playoffs from 2006 to 2010, advancing to at least the second round each time.[38] The 2006–07 Cavaliers advanced to the franchise's first NBA Finals, but were swept by the San Antonio Spurs.[50][51] The 2008–09 Cavaliers won a franchise-record 66 games, including a franchise-best 39–2 record at home, but lost the Eastern Conference Finals to the Orlando Magic.[38] Despite the addition of four-time NBA champion Shaquille O'Neal,[52] the 2009–10 Cavaliers were unable to return to the Eastern Conference Finals after losing to the Boston Celtics in the second round.[38] With the Cavaliers out of the playoffs, the focus turned to James' impending free agency.[53] On July 8, 2010, James announced in a nationally televised one-hour special titled The Decision that he would be signing with the Miami Heat.[54] The repercussions of this announcement left many in the city of Cleveland infuriated and feeling betrayed.[55] After a 19–win season in 2010–11, the Cavaliers began a rebuild around Kyrie Irving, whom they selected first overall in the 2011 NBA draft.[38][56] In 2014, James returned to the Cavaliers after four seasons in Miami. While the Heat had a 224–88 record during James' four-year tenure and won NBA titles in 2012 and 2013, the Cavaliers went 97–215 and missed the playoffs each season.[57] The Cavaliers made several moves to build a championship-contending team around James, most notably acquiring power forward Kevin Love from the Minnesota Timberwolves, which created what many fans and media referred to as a \"Big Three\" with James, Love and Irving.[58] The Lebron-led Cavaliers made four consecutive Finals appearances from 2015 to 2018 – all against the Golden State Warriors – winning in 2016.[38][59] The 2016 NBA Championship marked the Cavaliers' first title in franchise history, as they became the first team to come back from a 3–1 deficit to win the Finals.[59] It was also Cleveland's first championship in major professional sports since the 1964 Browns, signaling the end of the so-called Cleveland sports curse.[60] The Cavaliers' roster went through many changes in the 2017–18 season, most notably the trade of Irving to the Boston Celtics in exchange for Isaiah Thomas and other assets.[61][62] Thomas was later traded to the Los Angeles Lakers as part of a trade deadline overhaul that saw the Cavaliers add Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance Jr. (son of Cavs legend Larry Nance) and others.[63] The following offseason, James declined his player option to rejoin the team, instead signing with the Lakers.[64] In the following two seasons, the team recorded only 19 wins and failed to make the playoffs.[38] In the first three seasons since James left the second time, the Cavaliers won a total of 60 games, missed the playoffs each season and have had four different head coaches: Tyronn Lue, Larry Drew, John Beilein and by this time, J.B. Bickerstaff, who was promoted to head coach for the 2020–21 season after he had been an assistant on Belien's staff the previous season.[38][65][66] In the 2021–22 season, the Cavs finished 44–38 and eighth in the Eastern Conference, and qualified for the NBA play-in tournament, marking the first time the team played in the event. This also marks the team's first postseason basketball since 2017–18 and the first time a non-LeBron-led team qualified for postseason play since 1997–98. The team, however, did not make it out of the play-in tournament, losing the game to the Brooklyn Nets and then to the Atlanta Hawks, ending their season. On March 26, 2023, the Cavaliers clinched a spot in the NBA playoffs, making this the first time since 2018 that the team entered the playoffs, with a 108–91 win over the Houston Rockets. This was also the first time since 1998 that the team entered the playoffs without LeBron James.[67] They wound up losing their first round playoff series to the New York Knicks four games to one.[68] On October 25, 2023, it was announced that defensive end Myles Garrett of the Cleveland Browns had purchased a minority ownership stake in the Cavaliers. Along with his ownership stake, Garrett would serve as an ambassador for the team.[69] The Cavaliers qualified the 2024 NBA Playoffs as the 4th seed in the Eastern Conference, defeating the Orlando Magic 4–3 in the first round, but losing to the Boston Celtics 4–1 in the Conference semifinals.[70] On November 6th, 2024 the Cavaliers beat their all-time franchise \"season start\" win-streak, beating the New Orleans Pelicans 131-122 for a season record of 9-0. [71] After a 128-114 win against the Charlotte Hornets on November 17, 2024, the Cavaliers achieved a 15-0 start, which is tied for the second-best start in franchise history, and the Cavaliers are the fourth team to achieve this milestone, after the 2015-2016 Golden State Warriors team, the 1993-1994 Houston Rockets team, and the 1948-1949 Washington Capitols team. [72][73] The 15-0 start is also the Cavaliers’ longest winning streak in franchise history. [74] On November 19, 2024, the Boston Celtics ended the Cavaliers 15–0 start and 15 game winning streak when they won 120–117, giving the Cavaliers their first loss of the season.

Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W–L% = Winning percentage When the Cleveland Cavaliers debuted in the NBA in 1970, the team's original jersey colors were wine and gold. The first jerseys featured the feathered treatment of the letter \"C\" in \"Cavaliers\". In 1974, they changed into the classic block lettering and checkerboard pattern that was synonymous to the \"Miracle of Richfield\" team of 1976. In 1980, the gold shade was changed from yellowish to metallic, and the uniforms removed the checkerboard pattern and placed the stripes above \"Cleveland\" and below the uniform number, the only time the city name was featured in both home and away jerseys. The original logo was that of a swashbuckling cavalier looking right with a sword pointing, surrounded by the team name and a basketball. A modernized swashbuckling cavalier logo was later used by the Cavaliers' NBA Development League affiliate, the Canton Charge. The gold checkerboard uniforms were used as throwbacks in the 2004–05 season to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the \"Miracle of Richfield\" team, while the gold \"feathered C\" uniforms were used again in the 2008–09 season as a buildup to the then-upcoming 40th season of the Cavaliers. The \"Miracle of Richfield\" gold uniforms were used again in the 2015–16 season on special \"Hardwood Classic\" nights to commemorate the Miracle of Richfield team's 40th-anniversary celebration. In the 1983–84 season, the colors were changed to burnt orange, blue and white. The first Cavaliers uniform under the new scheme featured the Cavaliers logo (with a \"V\" in the shape of a hoop and circle above as basketball) in an arched pattern and the player name sewn onto the back shoulder as a patch, with orange being the primary color in both the away and home uniforms. However, in the 1987–88 season, orange was relegated as a secondary color, and blue was used instead as the primary for the away and home uniforms; minor changes in the 1989–90 season include the city name on the blue away uniforms. The drop shadows were also removed. The orange version of the uniform was used again in the 2006–07 and 2016–17 seasons, as part of the respective 20th and 30th anniversaries of the 1986–87 team.[78] The blue versions were worn in the 2009–10 season as part of the franchise's 40th anniversary and as a tribute to the 1988–89 team. Coinciding with the move to Gund Arena in the 1994–95 season, the Cavaliers changed logos and uniforms, adding black in addition to the already existing blue, orange and white colors. The uniforms feature a blue splash in the abdomen area in front. From 1994 to 1997, the word \"CAVS\" on the home uniforms was orange with black lines, while the numbers are in black with white lines; \"CLEVELAND\" on the road uniforms was also orange with black lines, while the numbers are in white with a black line. From 1997 to 1999, the numbers and lettering were slightly tweaked: The word \"CAVS\" and the numbers on the home uniforms were black with orange lines, while the word \"CLEVELAND\" and the numbers on the road uniforms were white with orange lines. In the latter iteration, the blue splash was moved from the right leg to the left leg, surrounding \"CLEVELAND\" on the home uniforms and \"CAVS\" on the road uniforms, with a minor change in striping. In the 1999–2000 season, the Cavaliers opted to go for a cleaner look, eliminating the splash and adding an orange and blue line that runs through the shorts. The home jerseys feature the team nickname and the uniform numbers are in blue with black lines, while the away jerseys featured the city name and the uniform numbers in white with blue lines; these jerseys were used until the 2002–03 season. The logo used in this period was of a basketball on its way down a net, surrounded by a black square and the word \"CAVS\" in blue with black line below. The 1994–1996 black uniforms were revived for the 2019–20 season as part of the Cavaliers' 50th season, as well as the 25th anniversary of the move to Gund Arena (now Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse).[79] The Cavaliers switched to a modified version of the team's classic wine-and-gold scheme in the 2003–04 season: metallic gold and a crimson shade of wine with navy blue added. The home uniform was white, with the word \"Cavaliers\" in wine lettering with gold trim on the front, the player's name in wine lettering with gold trim on the back, the player's numbers in navy blue, and wine-and-gold trim on the sides. The team's standard road uniform was wine-colored, with the word \"Cleveland\", the player's name and the player's numbers all in white lettering with gold trim, as well as white and gold trim on the sides. The team's alternate jersey was navy blue with the word \"Cleveland\", the player's name and the player's numbers all in white lettering with gold trim, as well as a wine, gold and navy blue checkerboard trim. The checkerboard trim was a tribute to the original Cavaliers uniforms from the 1970s. The logo used was a gold sword piercing through the words \"Cleveland Cavaliers\" in white and navy trim, with a wine basketball surrounding it. The Cavaliers debuted new uniforms before the start of the 2010–11 NBA season to coincide with the team returning to the original shades of wine and gold used from 1970 to 1983.[80] The home uniform is white with a wine-and-gold horizontal stripe trim on the collar, sleeves, waistband and pant legs, the word \"CAVALIERS\" (in block style lettering) in wine on the front of the jersey with wine lettering for the name and number, and white shoes and socks. The road uniform is wine-colored with the same stripe trim, \"Cleveland\" in gold on the front of the jersey, gold lettering on the name and number, and black shoes and socks. An alternate jersey – gold with \"CAVS\" in wine on the front of the jersey, wine lettering on the name and number, white socks and shoes, and the same stripe trim as the other uniforms[81] – was added for the 2012–13 season. All uniforms have the team motto – \"All for one. One for all.\" – stitched on the inside of the collar and the secondary \"Sword C\" logo on the side of the pant legs. The logo used is the same piercing sword logo, updated to the classic wine-and-gold scheme. For the 2014–15 season, a second alternate jersey – and fourth uniform overall – was added, which is navy blue (a callback to the 1987–1994 style) with \"CAVS\" and the player's number in wine with gold trim, the player's name on the back of the jersey in gold and the \"Sword C\" logo on the side of the pant legs.[82] Two alternate jerseys were unveiled prior to the start of the 2015–16 season.[83] The second wine uniform is similar to their regular road jersey, except that it features the arched mid-1980s Cavs logo and white numerals in gold trim. A black sleeved uniform features the wine \"C\" logo in front and was famously worn in the title-clinching Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals.[84][85] Their logos for the 2017–18 season newly included the color black to commemorate the victory.[86][87] Beginning in the 2017–18 season, all NBA teams switched to Nike-designed white \"Association\" uniforms and \"Icon\" uniforms in the respective team's primary color. The Cavaliers' Icon uniforms were wine-colored with \"Cleveland\" across the front and the player's name in gold lettering with navy blue numerals both in the front and in the back. The white Association uniforms have \"Cavs\" across the front, with wine color letters and numbers both front and back. All teams have the choice of which uniform to wear for any home game. Also included on the Cavs' jerseys is a small Goodyear \"Wingfoot\" logo, as part of a sponsorship deal with the team.[88][89] Nike also provides a third, alternate uniform called the \"Statement\" uniform. The Cavaliers' Statement uniform is black with dark gray pinstripes, a wine-colored \"C\" trimmed in gold on the front, names in gold letters on the back, wine-colored/gold-trimmed numbers on the front and back, and gold-colored Nike and Goodyear logos on the front. In the same vein as the logo on their 2017–18 jerseys, the black jersey is a nod to the team's former black-sleeved jerseys that they wore when they won Game 7 of the 2016 Finals.[90] For the 2022–23 NBA season, the Cavaliers unveiled an updated logo and color scheme, removing navy blue while reverting to the metallic gold first used from 1980 to 1983, and from 2003 to 2010. The \"C-sword\" alternate logo was retired, and an updated \"V-net\" logo, merging the styles of the 1983–1994 and 1994–2003 logos with the current typeface, was also unveiled.[3][4] With the new logo, the team also introduced three coinciding new uniforms. The white Association uniform features a wine-colored \"V-net\" logo trimmed in gold across the front, wine names and numbers trimmed in gold, and a wine primary \"Cavs C\" logo (outlined in gold) on left leg of the shorts. The wine Icon uniform features \"Cleveland\" in gold lettering on the chest, gold names and numbers, and the \"Cavs C\" logo in wine with a gold outline on the left leg of the shorts. The black Statement uniform – a nod to the black uniforms worn during the team's 2016 NBA championship run – displays a wine \"Cavs C\" logo outlined in gold on the front of the jersey, gold names and numbers, and a gold \"V-net\" logo on the left leg of the shorts.[91][92] From the 2008–09 to the 2011–12 season, the Cavaliers wore special \"mash-up\" uniforms – combining the style from one era with the color scheme of another – on select \"CavFanatic Nights\". Nike also provides a fourth uniform known as the \"City Edition\", which honors the city of Cleveland as well as the state of Ohio: Cleveland Clinic Courts, the team's practice facility and team headquarters, is located in suburban Independence. The 50,000-square-foot (4,600 m2) building opened in 2007 and includes two full-size basketball courts, a weight room, a team room, offices, medical facilities, and kitchen and dining facilities. Naming rights are held by the Cleveland Clinic, which is the team's official healthcare partner. Prior to the opening of Cleveland Clinic Courts, the team used the practice court located on the club level of Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.[104][105][106] In honor of the Cavs winning the NBA Championship, the city of Independence renamed the section of Brecksville Road leading to the team's practice facility \"Cavaliers Way\" in November 2016.[107] Roster Last transaction: January 9, 2025 The Cavaliers hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player – either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him – is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.[108] This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. The following is a list of past Cavaliers players and other personnel who have been honored as \"Cavs Legends\" – either by retiring their number or having commemorative banners placed in the rafters at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.[112][113][114] In 2019, the Cavaliers introduced the Wall of Honor, which honors former players and other personnel, and is located in the newly added North Atrium of the renovated Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.[118] Note - All personnel who have had their numbers retired or have a similar banner in the rafters are also inducted into the Wall of Honor The following is a list of players and other personnel who have spent at least part of their careers with the Cavaliers that have been inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.

When Daugherty serves as game analyst, Carr takes Gibson's place on the pregame/halftime/postgame shows. The Cavaliers have two official mascots: Moondog and Sir C.C. The former was inspired by Cleveland radio DJ Alan Freed, who popularized the phrase \"rock and roll\" and had called himself \"Moondog\". Moondog was an NBA All-Star selection in 2003 and 2004, and he made his first appearance on November 5, 2003. Sir C.C., a swashbuckler character, debuted during a game on November 27, 2010.[124] During the 1990s and early 2000s, the Cavs had a polar bear mascot named Whammer, who was introduced on November 9, 1995. He still makes occasional appearances throughout the season at Cavaliers games.",

Mathison told \"Good Morning America\" on Thursday that although he and his family are safe, he has been left with only a few pieces of clothing and a few personal items after losing his Altadena home of a decade. \"I've been up all night. I can't sleep,\" Mathison told \"GMA.\" \"I've lost my home and everything that I own. I have this hoodie and a pair of pants and two pairs of sneakers left. That's it.\" Billy Crystal, Paris Hilton and other celebs lose homes in LA fires The actor and former \"GMA\" contributor said he first noticed the Eaton Fire, which began north of Pasadena, on Tuesday as he was heading out for dinner. The Eaton Fire has since grown to envelop over 10,000 acres and is at 0% containment, with up to 500 structures damaged or destroyed. \"I raced back home and I put a bag together with what I'm wearing ... and I left to come and stay at an apartment here in Pasadena with my daughter and her mom and then as we're watching the news, I realize this could be bad,\" Mathison recalled. Mathison has been sharing on social media what he's seen of the fire damage, writing in an Instagram video caption on Wednesday, \"This is what's left of our beautiful home. Our home where our kids were raised and where they wanted to raise their own someday.\" The video shows still-burning structures and charred trees surrounding the decimated debris of what used to be his home. Mathison described his hometown of Altadena as being \"completely decimated, like completely, as if nothing has been built.\" \"It's so outrageous. So, so many people with so much loss,\" he continued. \"It is still very unsettling and so surreal -- and again, thinking about the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that are going through the same thing, it's just ... devastating.\" As Mathison's family and thousands of other families begin to process and respond to the wildfires' impact, Mathison said he and his community plan to \"help in any way.\" Here's how to help wildfire victims as California blazes explode in size \"Our neighbors are coming together in every way that we can, supporting each other and also trying to help people that still have their homes. Amazingly, there's still homes standing here and there,\" Mathison said. For others looking to help wildfire victims, Mathison said, \"I really believe that prayers make a big difference, but also offering homes.\" © 2025 ABC News",

The Los Angeles wildfires have claimed Cameron Mathison’s home. The All My Children alum shared that his Pacific Palisades residence was destroyed by the fire ravaging Southern California as he posted video footage of the blaze’s aftermath. Thankfully, he noted that he and his family were not harmed in the disaster. “We are safe,” Cameron wrote on Instagram Jan. 8 alongside a video of his property, which showed several flames still burning. “But this is what’s left of our beautiful home.” In the clip, the 55-year-old—who shares kids Lucas, 21, and Leila, 18, with estranged wife Vanessa Arevalo—showed the charred structure and heaps of debris that remained following the devastating fire. “Our home where our kids were raised,” his caption continued, “and where they wanted to raise their own someday.” The soap actor thanked his followers for their well-wishes, adding that he was “sending so many prayers to everyone being affected by these fires.” As the flames rage on, evacuation orders have displaced tens of thousands of Los Angeles residents while over 1,000 homes in Pacific Palisades—roughly 19 miles from downtown L.A.—have burned down, according to NBC News. Cameron is one of many stars who have spoken out about the wildfires. The Hills alums Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt’s Palisades property was also engulfed by the blaze after the couple—who share sons Gunner, 7, and Ryker, 2—were safely evacuated. Spencer confirmed their home was affected in a Jan. 7 Snapchat video, saying, “I'm watching our house burn down on the security cameras.” His sister, Stephanie Pratt, later confirmed the destruction, writing in an Instagram Stories post that she was “heartbroken for my brother, Heidi & the kids,” as well as “all of our friends and neighbors who have lost their houses today.” “We are such a tight community,” the reality star continued. “I’m at a loss for words knowing so many friends have lost their homes today and so quickly.” Keep reading for more stars’ reaction to the devastating fires. Mandy Moore The This Is Us alum—who is mom to three kids with husband Taylor Goldsmith—shared an update on her family after having to evacuate their home. \"We were able to park and walk up our street to bear witness to all the loss,\" she wrote on Instagram Jan. 9. \"Miraculously, the main part of our house is still standing.

                "title": "Video Shows Studio City Home Collapse After Being Engulfed By Wildfire - Newsweek",
                "content": "A dramatic video has surfaced showing a Studio City home collapsing into flames as wildfires tear through the area. Wildfires, caused by powerful Santa Ana winds, are currently engulfing much of Los Angeles. Known for their hot, dry nature, Santa Ana winds rapidly sap moisture from vegetation, leaving grasses, shrubs and trees highly combustible. Under such conditions, any spark—whether from downed power lines, machinery or natural events such as lightning—can ignite an inferno, with containment efforts significantly hindered by the winds' ferocity. So far, at least 5 people have died as a result of the wildfires, and several have been injured, authorities said in a press conference Wednesday. At least 2,000 structures have been destroyed across the city. A large house fire erupted in the Studio City area of Los Angeles on Wednesday night. Video footage of a live broadcast of the fire showed the four-story house collapse as flames engulfed the structure. WATCH: Building collapses during new fire in Studio City, Los Angeles pic.twitter.com/wPD7gw2pZR LAFD reported the fire on the 3000 block of North Sunswept Drive at 8:52 p.m., saying the residence was \"well involved in fire with exposures and vegetation.\" The fire reportedly engulfed the home and spread to the nearby brush and jumped to neighboring houses. Firefighters quickly shifted to a defensive strategy to contain the blaze and prevent it from spreading further into the surrounding vegetation. The flames consumed the stilts supporting the home, causing it to collapse onto the hillside. Meanwhile, embers scattered into nearby brush, prompting crews to act swiftly with water hoses to extinguish them. LAFD deployed over 50 firefighters, who brought the fire under control within two hours. No injuries were reported in the immediate aftermath of the incident. The fire took place shortly after another blaze was reported on the other side of the mountains in Hollywood Hills. The two fires were not related, LAFD said. Studio City is located in Hollywood. Notable residents have included Zac Efron, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Ryan Gosling, among others. The wildfires began on Tuesday around 11 a.m. when fire broke out in the Santa Monica mountains. The exact cause is still under investigation, but it is believed they are being fueled by strong Santa Ana winds and dry conditions after low rainfall this season. By 5 p.m. on Tuesday, the fire had burnt more than 1,260 acres, and hours later the authorities reported that it had spread to 2,900 acres. At least seven fires have occurred in Los Angeles. Those include the Palisades Fire in Pacific Palisades, which has already burned through more than 15,800 acres, as well as the Eaton Fire, which is raging inland close to Pasadena across 10,600 acres. Neither fire has been contained. The third fire, named the Hurst fire, is burning in Sylmar, in the San Fernando Valley northwest of Los Angeles. That has affected 855 acres but is now 10 percent contained. Meanwhile, the Lidia Fire began on Wednesday in Acton, to the northeast of Santa Clarita, and was at nearly 350 acres with 40 percent containment. A fifth fire, the Woodley Fire in the Sepulveda Basin, was quickly brought under control on Wednesday, burning across 30 acres. The Tyler Fire, in Coachella, was fully contained on Wednesday after spreading across 15 acres and destroying 2 structures. The Sunset fire burned across 60 acres in the Hollywood hills on Wednesday night. The wildfires have prompted the mandatory evacuation of more than 130,000 people so far. Evacuation orders are currently in place in Pasadena, Altadena and Sierra Madre, as well as in Calabasas, Malibu, parts of Los Angeles, Pacific Palisades and Topanga Canyon. Los Angeles Fire Department said: \"Over 50 firefighters extinguished the fire with no injuries reported. The fire extended into the surrounding vegetation, created small spot fires and caused some (extent not known at this time) damage to exposed buildings.\" Adam Vangerpen, a spokesperson with LAFD, told KTLA: \"We did just have the winds pick up again so we are seeing some ember casting from that four-story structure. Our hope is to hit it hard, and we're trying to keep it out of the brush right now.\" Firefighters and other emergency workers continue battling the major fires burning in and around Los Angeles and assisting in evacuation efforts. While the potent winds driving the fires to rapidly escalate were expected to die down by Thursday night, the initial causes of all the blazes remain under investigation.

Firefighters prevented flames from spreading in nearby brush, avoiding what authorities said could have been a much larger and more destructive fire in the densely populated hills above Ventura Boulevard in the San Fernando Valley community. 📺 Los Angeles news 24/7: Watch NBC4 free wherever you are The fire broke out as major wildfires burn around Los Angeles County, including the Palisades Fire in Pacific Palisades. \"Our fire department was faced with another massive challenge,\" said LAFD Chief Kristin M. Crowley. \"High winds caused the fire to extend within adjacent brush, potentially causing another brush fire. We were successful in preventing another devastating brush fire.\" The fire extended to about 1 acre of brush. Homeowners described a race to grab what they could as their home burned. \"We heard what seemed to be gunshots and looked outside,\" a homeowner told a photographer at the scene. \"We saw our next-door neighbor's, fire coming out of their home. Took a second, went back out again… and I said, 'Our house is on fire.' \"We grabbed our phones, our computer and our dogs and ran out.\" No injuries were reported. The fire, which burned two homes in the 3600 block of North Sunswept Drive, was knocked down around 10 p.m. Details about how the fire started were not immediately available. On the southern facing side of the hills, a brush fire forced evacuations Wednesday night. Water-dropping helicopters attacked the Sunset Fir, which burned about 60 acres near Runyon Canyon. Evacuation orders were lifted Thursday morning. There was no immediate word on how the fire started.",
