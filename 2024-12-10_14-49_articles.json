                "title": "Who is Luigi Mangione: What we know about healthcare CEO shooting suspect",
                "content": "A profile is emerging of the 26-year-old man charged with murder over last week's fatal shooting of United Healthcare's chief executive, Brian Thompson, in New York City. Police announced on Monday they had arrested Luigi Mangione on firearms charges after he was recognised at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania. The Baltimore, Maryland, native was found in possession of a so-called ghost gun, a largely untraceable firearm, and a three-page handwritten document that indicated \"motivation and mindset\", officials said. Just hours after his arrest, Mr Mangione was charged by New York investigators with murder and four other counts. Here's all that we've learned so far about the suspect. Mr Mangione was born and raised in Maryland and has ties to San Francisco, California, according to New York Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny. He has no prior arrests in New York and his last previous address was in Honolulu, Hawaii, police said. He attended a private, all-boys high school in Baltimore, called the Gilman School, according to school officials. Mr Mangione was named as the valedictorian, which is usually the student with the highest academic achievements in a class. In a statement, the school called the situation \"deeply distressing\". A former classmate, Freddie Leatherbury, told the Associated Press news agency that Mr Mangione came from a wealthy family, even by that private school's standards. \"Quite honestly, he had everything going for him,\" Mr Leatherbury said. Mr Mangione comes from a prominent family in the Baltimore area whose businesses include a country club and nursing homes, according to local media. Shortly after the suspect was charged, Republican state lawmaker Nino Mangione - believed to be his cousin - released a statement saying the family is \"shocked and devastated\". \"We offer our prayers to the family of Brian Thompson and we ask people to pray for all involved\", the statement read, signing off as \"The Mangione Family\". Mr Mangione is also a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, where he received a bachelor's and master's degree in computer science, according to the school, and founded a video game development club. A friend who attended the Ivy League college at the same time as Mr Mangione described him as a \"super normal\" and \"smart person\". Mr Mangione was employed as a data engineer for TrueCar, a digital retailing website for new and used cars, according to his social media profiles. A company spokesman told the BBC he had not worked there since 2023. According to the LinkedIn profile, Mr Mangione previously worked as a programming intern for Firaxis, a video game developer. Mr Mangione was taken into custody at a McDonald's after a customer informed an employee, who tipped off authorities. At the time, he was in possession of a black ghost gun - the kind that could be assembled at home using a 3D printer - a silencer and a loaded magazine with six rounds of 9mm ammunition. Police said he was carrying several IDs, including one with his real identity and another that was fake. These IDs included a US passport and a fraudulent New Jersey ID that was used to check into the New York City hostel, where the suspect was seen before the shooting. When he was told he would be arrested if he had lied about his name, he admitted he was Luigi Mangione. Asked why he lied, he told officers \"I clearly shouldn't have\", according to court papers. He \"became quiet and started to shake\" when asked if he had recently been to New York, according to the criminal complaint filed in Pennsylvania. Police say he was also found with three pages of handwritten documents in which he seemed to express \"ill will towards corporate America\". The document also said \"These parasites had it coming\" and \"I do apologise for any strife and trauma, but it had to be done\", a senior law enforcement official told the New York Times. Police said although his arrest was \"peaceful\", he has since stopped being cooperative. Social media profiles provide some possible clues about Mr Mangione's thinking. A person matching his name and photo had an account on Goodreads, a user-generated book review site, where he gave four stars to a text called Industrial Society and Its Future by Theodore Kaczynski – also known as the Unabomber manifesto. Starting in 1978, Kaczynski carried out a bombing campaign that killed three people and injured dozens of others, until he was arrested in 1996. In his review, Mr Mangione wrote: \"It's easy to quickly and thoughtless[ly] write this off as the manifesto of a lunatic. \"He was a violent individual - rightfully imprisoned - who maimed innocent people. \"While these actions tend to be characterized as those of a crazy luddite, however, they are more accurately seen as those of an extreme political revolutionary.\" His social media profiles also suggest that he had fallen out of touch with family and friends in recent months. In a post on X from October, someone tagged an account believed to be Mr Mangione's and wrote: \"Hey, are you ok? Nobody has heard from you in months, and apparently your family is looking for you.\" The 26-year-old was taken into custody at a McDonald's in Pennsylvania, in connection to the killing of United Health CEO Brian Thompson. The court says Murdoch acted in \"bad faith\" by trying to give control of his empire to his eldest son. A prosecutor says Luigi Mangione, 26, who was denied bail at an initial court appearance, is likely to be charged with homicide. President-elect Donald Trump's daughter-in-law announced the move amid speculation that she could be chosen to fill a potential Senate vacancy.

                "title": "Luigi Mangione’s Hawaiʻi friends shocked by arrest In UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting",
                "content": "Manage your account Luigi Mangione, pictured second from left, lived in Hawaii before becoming a suspect in the shooting death last week of a health insurance executive in New York City. Photo courtesy Surfbreak Hawaii. By Stewart Yerton and Christina Jedra Honolulu Civil Beat Hawaii friends of Luigi Mangione, arrested in the killing of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO, recall him as a natural leader who led a book club where members would share ideas while watching sunsets from a place called Magic Island. “He was just such a thoughtful and deeply compassionate person at everything he did,” said Jackie Wexler, a food technologist in New York. She used to live with Mangione at Surfbreak, a co-living space near Honolulu’s Ala Moana Beach Park. Mangione, 26, suffered chronic back pain from an apparent pinched nerve, said R.J. Martin, Surfbreak’s founder. His friends stopped hearing from him this summer. He said he was stunned by Mangione’s arrest. “I loved this guy,” said Martin. “In some ways I feel like my members are my kids.” Suspect in health care exec shooting is a Md. native, reportedly cousin of state lawmaker Wexler had attended the University of Pennsylvania with Mangione, she says, but didn’t become friends with him until they were both living on Oahu at Surfbreak. Originally envisioned as long-term housing for graduate students, Surfbreak morphed into a sort of adult dorm for, as its website says, “adventurers, remote workers, and mindful travelers united by shared life in our co-living + coworking spaces.” Mangione was arrested in a Pennsylvania McDonald’s restaurant on Monday and charged with five crimes, including carrying gun without a license, forgery, falsely identifying himself to the authorities and possessing “instruments of crime.” He is suspected of shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last week in New York City. Surfbreak residents are expected to contribute to the community, and Mangione played a role by founding the book club with Wexler and Martin. They recall Mangione had recently read Yuval Noah Harari’s “Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind” and was enthusiastic about sharing ideas with friends. The book club’s reading list included “What’s Our Problem,” by Tim Urban, the creator of the blog “Wait But Why,” and “The Ape that Understood the Universe: How the Mind and Culture Evolve,” by Steve Stewart Williams, Wexler and Martin said. Wexler recalls Mangione as a thoughtful man who facilitated discussions by deeply listening. Martin, a former college professor who has a doctorate in history, said Mangione had a rare ability to articulate ideas in the books they read. “I feel like he did a better job of parsing through the nuances of things,” Martin said. Wexler and Martin said they had suggested the book club read the manifesto of Ted Kaczynski, known as the Unabomber, as “a joke.” Mangione reviewed it on a Goodreads account, which had been widely cited on social media on Monday. The rambling Kaczynaki screed proved “painful to read” and so hard to engage with that it led to the demise of the club, Martin said. Mangione was committed to personal development through reading and working out. He got around Oahu by bicycle, and even after he moved out of Surfbreak, he would walk with Wexler from Magic Island to Surfbreak, located in the penthouse of a building near the Hawaii Convention Center. But it wasn’t all idyllic. Mangione was often in pain from a back problem, Martin said, although the two would still rock climb together at at HiClimb, a gym in Kakaʻako near Surfbreak. Martin recalled the problem, which had lingered for years, was a misaligned vertebrae that would pinch Mangione’s spinal cord. Martin did not recall the exact dates Mangione lived at Surfbreak but says they stayed in regular contact after Mangione left. Martin said Mangione later texted him pictures after getting back surgery. “He went radio silent in June or July,” Martin said. Mangione has no significant criminal record in Hawaii. He was criminally cited on Nov. 12 of last year for trespassing in a “closed area” of Nuuanu Pali Lookout, a popular scenic viewpoint frequented by tourists on Oahu. At the time, he told a state parks officer his address was in Towson, Maryland, according to the citation. After pleading no contest to the petty misdemeanor offense, court records show he paid a court-ordered $100 fine. Honolulu police said he had no other run-ins on the island. Mangione had a gun believed to be the one used in last week’s shooting and was taken into custody after police got a tip that he had been spotted at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania. The news has been heartbreaking for his Hawaii friends. “It just makes me sad to think how alone he must feel,” Wexler said. – The Associated Press contributed to this story.",

The reasons for such a distinction didn't have much to do with the game's postseason implications — Cincinnati's playoff hopes are on their last legs, while Dallas' have already evaporated. Rather, this was a spectacle, just the sort that Jerry Jones envisioned when drawing up the plans for AT&T Stadium, the booming metropolis he hoped would house championship-caliber teams. So, how is that plan going along thus far? Well, on Monday, the Cowboys added a new low to a season increasingly filled with them, falling to the Bengals 27-20 under the MNF banner. MORE BENGALS-COWBOYS: A defeat to Cincinnati and its talismanic battery of Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase wouldn't be a cause of much concern in normal circumstances. The pairing was as lively as ever on Monday, with Burrow completing 75 percent of his pass attempts and accounting for 369 yards and three touchdowns worth of passing offense. Chase collected 14 catches for 177 yards and two scores on the night, further cementing his place as a legitimate Offensive Player of the Year contender. For all of Burrow and Chase's heroics, it was Dallas that looked the likelier victors with two minutes left. Nick Vigil burst through the mire, got his harrowing mitts to Ryan Rehkow's attempted punt, and batted it down to a mere trickle off Rehkow's foot. The ball sidled back and forth like a tumbleweed as it bounded harmlessly toward midfield, seemingly foreshadowing some sort of Cowboys win. Right? Not exactly. Gunner Amani Oruwariye attempted to field the bouncing ball, only to mishandle the wild feather. It bounced into Cincinnati's hands afterward. League rules insist that in such a circumstance, the kicking team receives the ball with a full set of downs. Burrow and Chase went to work, chopped down Dallas' secondary in one fell swoop, and walked out fortunate victors. The Cowboys, meanwhile, were left rueing another seemingly incomprehensible defeat.

The Cowboys are going to get the ball back as we sink below two minutes. 10:59 p.m.: Burrow's return to the field coincided with a new fashion choice: after being swept away in Dallas' pass rush last possession, he's sporting a bulky sleeve across his left knee — the same one he injured as a rookie. 10:55 p.m.: Dallas returns the favor, recording a three-and-out of its own. The Bengals will take control with about 5:40 left in the fourth. 10:48 p.m.: Cincinnati is forced to boot the ball away. However, it's fairly apparent that a rusher grab a fistful of Burrow's facemark prior to him getting wrapped in a sack. Nevertheless, the call wasn't made. As such, the Bengals are forced to kick it away. 10:45 p.m.: Tanner Hudson is the latest name to get involved in the offensive action, gobbling up 19 yards after absorbing a Burrow bolt. 10:41 p.m.: Cincinnati's defense bursts into life, stacking the deck to force a Dallas three-and-out.

Rush will look to lead his offense back to its early game best after seeing three straight drives end in three-and-outs. 9:33 p.m.: FIELD GOAL!

Looks to be getting whatever he wants on offense, even when matched up against notable corners Bland and Diggs. 9:22 p.m.: Dallas falls flat on the ensuing drive, with the Bengals forcing a punt following a swift three-and-out. Cincinnati will have a chance to add to its advantage as the first half draws to a close. 9:14 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN!

Just snagged another Burrow dot as Cincinnati gets a new se too downs. He's up to four catches for 46 yards and a score thus far. 8:52 p.m.: INTERCEPTION! Miscommunication between Rush and Lamb ends in heartbreak. Anticipating the slant pattern, Rush fired a ball towards Lamb's general vicinity. Unfortunately for the Dallas signal-caller, Lamb was displaced, caught under the weight of an incidental collision with his marker. The result? A deflected ball that eventually landed in Geno Stone's grasp. Cincinnati's defense records a much-desired turnover to halt Dallas' red zone progress.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) Joe Burrow and the Cincinnati Bengals finally got a break. The Dallas Cowboys had flashbacks to one of the most painful moments in franchise history. Burrow threw a tiebreaking 40-yard touchdown pass to Ja'Marr Chase after Dallas botched a blocked punt to give the ball back to Cincinnati in the final two minutes, and the Bengals beat the Cowboys 27-20 on Monday night. The Cowboys were about to get the ball back with the score tied on the first play after the two-minute warning when Nick Vigil blocked a punt by Cincinnati's Ryan Rehkow. Amani Oruwariye tried to field the bouncing ball when leaving it alone would have given Dallas possession. Oruwariye couldn't hold on, and the Bengals' Maema Njongmeta recovered at the Cincinnati 43-yard line with 1:53 remaining. Three plays later, Burrow threw to Chase, who evaded DaRon Bland and ran untouched the rest of the way for the lead with 1:01 to go as the Bengals (5-8) stopped a three-game losing streak. The second one-score victory in a puzzling season for the defensively challenged Bengals came after all three losses during their second three-game skid - and seven of their eight defeats this season - were by seven points or less. “We needed a break,” Burrow said. “We haven’t got many this year, but it was nice to get that one and nice to come out of this with a win.” For the Cowboys, the scene that set up the Burrow-Chase winner was hauntingly familiar to a snowy Thanksgiving Day in 1993 at Texas Stadium. Leon Lett inexplicably slid in on the snow-covered field to try to recover a blocked field goal in the final seconds that would have given Dallas a victory over Miami. The Dolphins recovered and kicked a field goal on the final play for a 16-14 victory. Oruwariye's gaffe came in his first game back off injured reserve after missing five games with a back injury. Fellow defensive backs Jourdan Lewis and C.J. Goodwin kept reporters away from Oruwariye in the locker room after the game. Special teams coach John Fassel frantically waved from the sideline for all his players to get away from the ball after the block, but Oruwariye never hesitated to try to grab it. “You see why it happened,” Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy said. “He turns and the ball’s there. And he reacted to it. I haven’t seen the video. I saw it live. It’s definitely a tough learning opportunity.” The winning TD secured a fourth consecutive game of at least 300 yards passing and three touchdowns for Burrow, who finished with 369 and three scores, two to Chase. It was the first victory in that stretch. Chase, the NFL leader in yards receiving and touchdowns, had 177 yards on a season-high 14 catches and is up to 15 TDs. Chase easily navigated his way past Bland on the winning play. “Me and Joe were on the same page,” Chase said. “He threw to my inside shoulder so I can turn upfield after the catch.” Cooper Rush threw two TD passes and Rico Dowdle ran for a career-high 131 yards as the Cowboys (5-8) saw the end of a modest two-game winning streak after losing five in a row. A fourth consecutive playoff trip was already a long shot for Dallas, and is all but out of reach now. “We understand that we dug ourselves a hole,” McCarthy said. “We had to have this one tonight. This is a very disappointing loss.” The Bengals ended a five-game losing streak against the Cowboys with their first victory in the series since 2004. The Cowboys lost linebacker DeMarvion Overshown to a right knee injury in the fourth quarter. It came in the first game for Dallas since his spectacular 23-yard interception return for a touchdown in a 27-20 victory over the New York Giants on Thanksgiving. McCarthy said the injury was serious. Overshown missed all of his rookie season in 2023 with a torn ligament in his left knee. Burrow was walking with a limp after the game but said his knee won’t prevent him from playing. “It’s nothing crazy,” Burrow said. “Landed on it a couple times. Probably a bursa (sac). It’ll be sore. We’ll see.” Bengals: LB Joe Bachie was ruled out in the fourth quarter with a right groin injury. Cowboys: Rookie C Cooper Beebe sustained a concussion and was ruled out at halftime. RG Brock Hoffman, the replacement for injured seven-time All-Pro Zack Martin (ankle), moved to center. T.J. Bass took over at right guard. ... Special teams ace C.J. Goodwin was ruled out in the second half with a hamstring injury. Bengals: At Tennessee on Sunday. Cowboys: At Carolina on Sunday. --- AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl Copyright 2024 STATS LLC and Associated Press.

The Bengals entered Monday night’s matchup vs. the Dallas Cowboys with just four wins — and in the final minutes of the game — it looked like they would have another close loss as Burrow was sacked and Cincinnati was forced to punt with just under two minutes remaining. The Cowboys special teams unit found a way to break through and block the punt, but the ball bobbled around the midfield line and a Dallas player attempted to recover it, but it tipped off of his hands and fell into the arms of a Bengals player. And just like that, Burrow and the Bengals offense had a final chance to win the game and this time, they did just that. At the 1:01 mark in the fourth quarter Burrow connected with Ja’Marr Chase for a 40-yard touchdown which proved to be the game-winner. The ESPN cameras found Cowboys’ star pass rusher Micah Parsons on the bench, who was visibility furious, throwing his arms in the air and screaming in anger in disbelief of how they found a way to lose that game. Troy Aikman — who called the game with Joe Buck for ESPN — spoke about Parsons’ outburst with Scott Van Pelt after the game. Watch it here if you missed it during the game. “I would say this, the reaction from Micah Parsons, they say a picture is worth a thousand words,” Aikman said. “It’s pretty obvious what this game meant to Micah Parsons and the entire football team.” While it was a long shot, the Dallas Cowboys were still technically in the playoff hunt heading into Monday night’s game and the loss now officially eliminates them. There’s no doubt it’s been a disappointing season for Dallas and changes are likely coming this offseason. But for a Cincinnati Bengals team that lost their last three games by one score, luck was on their side on Monday night.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Dallas Cowboys appeared to have a shot at getting kicker Brandon Aubrey a game-winning field goal in a 20-20 game, but like much of the 2024 season, their Week 14 game against the Cincinnati Bengals unraveled. Dallas blocked a Bengals punt, but cornerback Amani Oruwariye muffed the football. That allowed Cincinnati to retain possession, and three plays later, it fully cashed in with quarterback Joe Burrow hitting wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase for a go-ahead, 40-yard touchdown with about a minute to play. The Bengals improved to 5-8 and snapped a three-game losing streak, while the Cowboys fell to 5-8 overall and 1-6 at home. The Bengals found the end zone with smooth catches by Chase and Chase Brown, who scored from 5 and 19 yards out, respectively. Chase dominated with a \"Monday Night Football\" record 14 catches -- a record he shares with Cooper Kupp (2022), Jerry Rice (1995) and Herman Moore (1995) -- to go along with 177 yards and two touchdowns. Brown, meanwhile, was Burrow's No. 2 receiver with six catches for 65 yards and a touchdown to go along with 58 yards on 14 carries. Burrow finished with 369 yards, three touchdowns and an interception of 33 of 44 passing. Cowboys wide receiver CeeDee Lamb balled out with 93 yards and a touchdown on six catches despite nursing a shoulder injury. He smoked Bengals cornerback Mike Hilton for an 11-yard score, snapping a five-game streak of games without a receiving touchdown. That was the second-longest streak of games without a touchdown in Lamb's five-year career. His touchdown also marked the Cowboys' first at home in the first quarter this season. Cowboys running back Rico Dowdle put together his second game in a row with a career-high in rushing yards with 131 on 18 carries after rushing for 112 yards on 22 carries in the team's Thanksgiving Day win over the New York Giants. Wide receiver Brandin Cooks also caught a touchdown in consecutive weeks with his short score Monday night. Check out our takeaways from the game below: Joe Burrow, Ja'Marr Chase and one massive, massive break in a big spot. Burrow was pretty close to flawless on the evening. He pretty much missed only one throw, which resulted in an interception after a pass over the middle sailed on him. Otherwise, he was escaping from pressure all night long, and still completed 33 of 44 passes for 369 yards and three touchdowns. Two of his scores went to Chase, who was utterly dominant and picked up the game-winner with just over a minute remaining. As for the massive break, just scroll on down to the \"turning point\" section and you'll see what we mean. Missed opportunities, and a back-breaking blunder. The Cowboys had a chance to take a lead early in the second quarter, but Cooper Rush forced a pass into traffic and got intercepted. They'd fail on another red-zone drive later in the game, settling for a field goal. They turned Cincinnati's two turnovers (one on downs) into only six points, and with two different chances to take a lead with the game tied in the fourth quarter, they gained just 13 total yards and punted it back to Cincinnati twice. And when it looked like the Cowboys would get one final opportunity, disaster struck... The Cowboys were oh-so-close to having a chance to win the game. They even looked like they were going to have just about as good of field position as possible to do it, too. On the first play following the two-minute warning, Nick Vigil broke through the line and blocked a punt. But then... This had shades of the Cowboys' Thanksgiving Day loss to the Miami Dolphins back in 1993, when they blocked a Dolphins field goal, only for Leon Lett to try to pick up the ball and run with it and then fumble it back to Miami. That's essentially what backup cornerback Amani Oruwariye did here, in terms of the ramifications on the specific game. On the ensuing drive after that fumble recovery, Chase went to work. Chase leads the NFL in catches, yards and touchdowns this season, and he added a whole lot to each of those totals Monday night. He saved his best for last, snagging a speed out with just over a minute remaining, planting his foot in the ground, accelerating past Daron Bland and then out-running the rest of the defense into the end zone for a 40-yard, game-winning score. Chase finished the evening with yet another monster game, racking up a \"Monday Night Football\" record 14 catches, on which he totaled 177 yards and two touchdowns. It was his fourth 100-plus-yard, multi-touchdown game of the season. The guy is just outrageous, and he keeps proving it every week. Cincinnati's victory stopped its three-game losing streak and gave the Bengals a 5-8 record. They close out the season with games at Tennessee, home against Cleveland and Denver, and then at Pittsburgh. They need to win out and get some help in order to make a run at a playoff berth. Dallas is also 5-8 after this loss. The Cowboys finish the season with games at Carolina, home against Tampa, at Philadelphia and home against Washington. Like the Bengals, they likely need to win out and get a whole lot of help if they want to make the playoffs. Ja'Marr Chase broke Cowboys cornerback Da'Ron Bland's ankles, and he then accelerated down the sideline for a 40-yard touchdown. Dallas trails 27-20 with 1:01 remaining and all three timeouts. Cowboys cornerback Amani Oruwariye attempted to field Dallas' blocked punt, but he muffed the football. Cincy recovered the football, so they get retain possession at their own 43 in 20-20 game with just under two minutes left to play. Following consecutive holding penalties, Cowboys rookie linebacker Marist Liufau sacked Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow. Cincy will punt the football back to Dallas with two minutes left to play in a 20-20 game. Following a 14-yard run by Rico Dowdle, Cooper Rush threw three consecutive incompletions. Following Dallas punt, the Bengals have the football on their own 14 in 20-20 game with 5:31 left to play. After a forced fumble by Trevon Diggs was changed to an incomplete pass, Cowboys safety Donovan Wilson strip-sacked Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow on third-and-13. Cincy recovered, and they will punt the ball back to Dallas in a 20-20 game. Dallas lost a yard across three plays with a loss of one by Rico Dowdle on the ground followed by consecutive incompletions. The Cowboys punt puts the Bengals at their own 26 with 9:33 left to play in a 20-20 game. The 2023 third round pick suffered a torn ACL in his second preseason game as a rookie, and he was playing high level ball in his first real NFL season. Cowboys cornerback DaRon Bland thwarted a third down end zone shot from Joe Burrow to Tee Higgins, which forced Cincy to settle for three. The game is tied at 20 with 10:24 left to play. Overshown remains down grabbing the back of his leg while being attended to by trainers and the team doctor. Rico Dowdle ripped off a 14-yard run on third-and-24 to get Dallas into a much more comfortable field goal range. Aubrey drilled the kick to return the lead to the host Cowboys 20-17. Dowdle now has consecutive 100-yard rushing games for the first time in his career. He has a career-high 118 rushing yards and counting on 16 carries. Rico Dowdle had his first career 100-yard rushing game, last week against the Giants. He's got another one today. New career high of 118 yards after having 112 against New York. Burrow overthrew Ja'Marr Chase over the middle, and Hooker made a tough, diving interception. The play marks Burrow's sixth interception of the season. Dallas takes over on their own 17 in a 17-17 game with 6:50 left in the third quarter. With a quarter and a half to go, Chase now leads the NFL in receptions, receiving yards and receiving touchdowns. Guy is pretty damn good. After Rico Dowdle's 27-yard run got Dallas down to the six, the Cowboys cashed in on a three-yard touchdown pass from Cooper Rush to Brandin Cooks. Cooks now has a touchdown in both games since he returned from a knee injury. The game is tied at 17 with 10:32 remaining in the third quarter. Brock Hoffman is now in at center, and T.J. Bass is now in at right guard. Dallas punts the football away after consecutive incompletions. Cincinnati heads to halftime with a 17-10 lead, and the Cowboys will start the third quarter with the football. The difference in this game is a Cooper Rush red zone interception when he forced a throw to wide receiver CeeDee Lamb. Both teams have gotten rare red zone stops tonight. Cincinnati is 2 of 3 turning red zone trips into touchdowns and Dallas is just 1 of 3 thanks to Geno Stone's interception of Cooper Rush. Kicker Cade York drilled a 37-yard field goal after a clear miscommunication between Joe Burrow and Ja'amArr Chase on third-and-7. Cincinnati leads 17-10 with 30 seconds left in the half. Dallas get the ball to start the third quarter. Cooper Rush couldn't get a throw off on third-and-7 as he got sacked by Joseph Ossai. The Bengals get the football back on their own 45 with 1:50 left to play in the play. They lead 14-10, and the Cowboys get the ball to start the third quarter. Chase Brown only had 16 catches for 61 yards through the Bengals' first eight games before Zack Moss got injured. He has 25 catches for 216 yards in the 4.5 games since, after that latest touchdown grab. He's become a key part of Cincinnati's passing attack. The officials overturned their original call on the field that Brown stepped out of bounds after Cincinnati challenged the play. The Bengals now have their first lead of the game, 14-10, with 3:30 left in the half. Dallas' drive fizzled out after running back Ezekiel Elliott gets just a yard on first down, which was followed by a four-yard completion from Cooper Rush to tight end Jake Ferguson and a third down incompletion. Brandon Aubrey is good from 35 yards out, which has Dallas up 10-7 with 6:23 left in the half. Demarvion Overshown is having a breakout year for the Cowboys. He missed his entire rookie season with a torn ACL but his been fantastic all year. He's second on the team in both tackles and sacks and first in tackles for loss. He's made plays as a pass rusher and in coverage. He's SO fast. Really good player. The Cowboys defense picks up its offense with Dallas linebacker DeMarvion Overshown breaking up a fourth-and-three pass to Bengals running back Chase Brown on fourth-and-3. The Cowboys get the football back at their own 44 with the game even at seven with 9:51 left in the second quarter. Speaking of career highs in YAC: Ja'Marr Chase is getting over 47% of his yards after the catch this year as well. Rush forced a pass to CeeDee Lamb that Cincinnati cornerback Cam Taylor-Britt tipped into the air, which led to Bengals safety Geno Stone intercepting the pass. Killer red zone interception. Bengals start their next drive at their own four to begin the second quarter in a seven-seven game. Rush forced a pass to CeeDee Lamb that Cincinnati cornerback Cam Taylor-Britt tipped into the air, which led to Bengals safety Geno Stone intercepting the pass. Killer red zone interception. CeeDee's big screen play is a reminder that he has picked up a career-high 44% of his receiving yards this year, after the catch. Without Dak Prescott for the last several weeks, he's had to do more of he work on his own. Per an official announcement in the press box, Smith is set to return to play on the next drive. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "title": "Daniel Penny found not guilty in chokehold death of Jordan Neely",
                "content": "Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Daniel Penny was acquitted Monday of criminally negligent homicide in the chokehold death of Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old homeless man with a history of mental illness whose final moments on a New York City subway train were captured on bystander video that set off weeks of protests and drew national attention. The decision, on the fifth day of deliberations, came after the jury deadlocked Friday on the more serious charge of manslaughter, leading the judge to dismiss it. Penny faced up to four years in prison. As the jury foreperson read the “not guilty” verdict, some observers in the courtroom applauded. Others began to audibly sob and yell, including Neely’s father, Andre Zachery, who was escorted out. “This is America. That is the sound of Black pain,” one person said outside of the courtroom in Lower Manhattan to the reaction. Chants of “no justice, no peace,” could be heard echoing from outside. The case divided people in New York — and beyond — in some cases along political and racial lines. Neely was Black. Penny is white. Some people viewed Penny as callous and his actions as criminal on the day he encountered Neely, who had been shouting and acting erratically when he boarded a subway train in Manhattan on May 1, 2023. Others contend Penny was selfless in his attempt to protect fellow passengers. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said he respected the jury's verdict. The jury deliberated for about an hour on the criminally negligent homicide charge after about four days spent considering the manslaughter charge. “Their lengthy deliberation — and the totality of the facts and the evidence — underscored why this case was put in front of a jury of Mr. Penny's peers,” Bragg said in a statement. The anonymous jury, made up of seven women and five men, were told before they began deliberating that they had to come to a unanimous decision on the top charge of manslaughter in the second degree before moving on to consider criminally negligent homicide. But Judge Maxwell Wiley changed that order Friday after jurors twice sent a note saying they could not reach an agreement. The judge had also instructed jurors to decide whether Penny’s actions caused Neely’s death and, if so, whether he had acted recklessly and in an unjustified manner. Before he encountered Penny, Neely, a former Michael Jackson impersonator, ranted about being hungry and thirsty and said that he wanted to return to jail and didn’t care if he lived or died, witnesses testified. Penny, 26, a former Marine and Long Island native, placed Neely in a chokehold that prosecutors said lasted almost six minutes. A New York City medical examiner ruled that Neely died from compression to his neck as a result of the chokehold. Neely’s uncle, Christopher Neely, said he was “taken aback” as the verdict was announced because he thought the jury would at least convict him on the lesser charge. “At least give him a charge because it should be some type of penalty that should have been been handed down to Danny Penny period. They gave him no penalty, and I feel like the jury gave up on us,” Neely said. Donte Mills, a lawyer representing Neely's family, said at a news conference that he was disheartened by the verdict Monday, as supporters held up a picture of Neely dressed as Jackson. Mills asked that Neely's death have meaning, and urged that others, instead of becoming physical with someone who may be hungry, offer them food. “He had a muffin in his pocket,” Mills said of what police later discovered in Neely's jacket. “Jordan just wanted someone to acknowledge him on the train, but instead, he was choked to death.” Lawyers for Penny could not immediately be reached for comment about the verdict, but had earlier expressed concern Monday to the judge that the jury could be influenced by the demonstrators' chanting coming from outside the courthouse. During the trial, Penny’s attorneys told jurors that he stepped in because he believed Neely might attack other passengers and he intended only to restrain him until police arrived, which Penny also told police. They also argued that Neely was not killed by the chokehold and that it was impossible to measure how much pressure Penny had applied. A forensic pathologist hired by the defense testified that Neely died from a combination of his schizophrenia, synthetic marijuana, sickle cell trait and the struggle from being in Penny’s restraint. But the medical examiner who performed the autopsy on Neely, Dr. Cynthia Harris, told jurors it was her medical opinion “that there are no alternative reasonable explanations” for his death and that those proposed by the defense were “so improbable — that it stands shoulder to shoulder with impossibility.” During cross-examination, one of Penny’s attorneys, Steven Raiser sought to cast doubt on Harris’ testimony about how she and her colleagues had come to a unanimous decision as to Neely’s cause of death. Raiser suggested that they had failed to consider all the facts before making that determination. He revisited that claim in his closing argument last week. “I submit to you there was a rush to judgment, based on something other than medical science,” he told jurors. The case also spurred debates about safety within the city’s subway system and failures in addressing homelessness and mental illness, both of which Neely had struggled with. Jumaane Williams, a Black Democrat who is New York City’s public advocate, was among those who questioned why police let Penny go after questioning him at a precinct hours after Neely’s killing. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, also a Democrat, said Neely had been “murdered.” Prominent Republicans like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Matt Gaetz praised Penny and promoted a fundraiser for his legal fund, which has raised more than $3 million. His defense team includes Thomas Kenniff, a Republican who ran unsuccessfully for Manhattan District Attorney in 2021. Vice President-elect JD Vance said on X in response to the verdict that “justice was done in this case. It was a scandal Penny was ever prosecuted in the first place.” Prosecutors did not dispute that Neely’s actions on the train scared many of the passengers or that he was on synthetic cannabinoids, which were found in his system. In her opening statement, Dafna Yoran, an assistant prosecutor with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, said that Neely had “demanded to be seen” and that despite his not having touched anyone and not having displayed a weapon or threatened to use one, many people in the subway car were frightened of what he might do. She has said Penny’s “initial intent was even laudable,” but that he was reckless when he continued to choke Neely even after he posed no threat, including after the train doors had opened at the next station and passengers could exit. For some of that time, she said and video showed, two other men helped restrain Neely. One of those men testified that he believed Penny had held the chokehold for too long. At times, Yoran said, he even ignored the pleas of bystanders to let Neely go. In her closing argument, Yoran said that “no one had to die” and that Penny was not justified in his use of physical deadly force. “You obviously cannot kill someone because they are crazy and ranting and looking menacing,” Yoran told jurors in her closing argument. “No matter what it is that they are saying.” She also said that Penny “could have easily restrained” Neely “without choking him to death.” In his closing argument, Raiser prompted jurors to imagine that they were on the train the day Neely boarded “filled with rage and not afraid of any consequences.” “With you sitting much as you are now in this tightly confined space, looking up at Mr. Neely,” he said. “You have very little room to move and nowhere to run.” “Danny,” as the defense attorneys referred to Penny throughout the trial, “put his life on the line” and stepped up in the absence of police, Raiser said. But Yoran challenged the portrayal of Penny as a self-sacrificing and benevolent subway rider. In her opening statement she said that Penny failed to acknowledge Neely’s humanity. She continued that thread in her closing argument, playing video of Penny twice referring to Neely as a “crackhead” in an interview with police and telling jurors that he never asked about Neely’s condition. “There is something else that is glaringly missing from his statement. Any regret. Any remorse. Any self reflection,” she said. She added: “He never expresses any sorrow about the man’s death.” During deliberations, jurors asked to rewatch bystander videos of Penny restraining Neely, responding officers’ body camera videos and video of Penny’s subsequent interview with two police detectives at a precinct. They also asked to rehear the medical examiner’s testimony about issuing a death certificate before Neely’s full toxicology reports were completed. They also asked for the judge to read back the definitions of recklessness and criminal negligence and to have the definitions in writing. Penny chose not to testify. During the trial, jurors heard from more than 40 witnesses — subway passengers who witnessed Penny restrain Neely, police officers who responded to the scene, a Marine Corps instructor who taught Penny various chokeholds, the two pathologists, a psychiatric expert and six character witnesses, who included two Marines, Penny’s mother and one of his sisters. On Wednesday, Neely’s father sued Penny accusing him of negligent contact, assault and battery that caused Neely’s death. The civil suit was filed in New York state’s Supreme Court, a trial-level court in New York state. Janelle Griffith is a national reporter for NBC News focusing on issues of race and policing.

                "title": "\n    Daniel Penny found not guilty in NYC subway chokehold death of Jordan Neely - CBS New York",
                "content": "Watch CBS News By Alice Gainer, Dick Brennan, Tim McNicholas Updated on: December 9, 2024 / 11:48 PM EST / CBS New York NEW YORK -- Daniel Penny has been found not guilty of criminally negligent homicide in the chokehold death of Jordan Neely on a New York City subway car in 2023. Penny, a 26-year-old Marine veteran, pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. The judge dismissed the manslaughter charge on Friday after jurors said they could not come to a unanimous decision. The jury could only consider the negligent homicide charge if Penny was cleared of manslaughter. Word of the verdict came after jurors deliberated for more than 20 hours. Penny appeared to smile, as his attorneys hugged each other. \"We couldn't be more pleased that a jury of Danny's peers acquitted him of any wrongdoing. And now New Yorkers can take some comfort in knowing that we can continue to stand up for one another without sacrificing our rights or our freedoms,\" his lawyers said in a statement. His attorneys later shared a photo on social media showing them raise a glass at a bar after the verdict. CBS News New York's Alice Gainer was inside the courtroom when the decision came down. She reported it was chaos, as some cheered in support of Penny, and Neely's father, Andre Zachery, had to leave the room because he stood up and was heard swearing. Penny faced a maximum possible sentence of 15 years in prison on the manslaughter charge, or four years on the negligent homicide charge. There was no minimum sentence. Dozens of protesters lined up outside the courthouse Monday, chanting \"Justice for Jordan Neely!\" Inside, Penny's defense team asked for a mistrial and once again was denied. The defense also raised concerns that jurors could potentially hear some of what the demonstrators were saying. They said the demonstrators were using megaphones and bullhorns, chanting things like, \"Murdered!\" and \"Subway strangler!\" The judge agreed he also heard the commotion and reminded the jury to ignore things they may hear or read about the case. Zachery told CBS News New York, \"My son didn't have to go through this. I didn't have to go through this, either. It hurts. It really, really hurts,\" adding, \"What's going to happen to us now? Had enough of this. System is rigged. Come on, people. Let's do something about this.\" One activist who had been outside demonstrating every morning was inside and yelled something at Penny along the lines of \"It's a small world, buddy.\" \"Our call to action is to take care of each other. We can't rely on outside people. If we see someone asking for food, we have to take the responsibility to give it to them. If we see someone cold, to give them a coat. If we see someone going through something, to ask them if they're OK,\" Donte Mills, attorney for the Neely family, said during a news conference outside the courthouse. \"That's how we help each other, because we can't rely on the system to do it for us.\" Eric Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, also spoke outside the courthouse, saying, \"No one deserves to be choked to death,\" adding, \"I tell this family, do not give up, because that's what they want you to do. They want to discourage you, just like they tried to discourage me. Ten years later, I'm still fighting.\" The Rev. Al Sharpton, who spoke at Neely's funeral, put out a statement, which read, in part, \"This verdict represents the blatant legalization of civilian vigilantism, sending a dangerous message that citizens can now take matters into their own hands, even if it leads to someone's death.\" \"It was foolish of us to think that a Black man would get justice in a system that is designed to keep him oppressed,\" added Chivona Newsome, co-founder of Black Lives Matter Greater New York. The verdict drew praise from Vice President-elect JD Vance and New York Congressman Mike Lawler, who both criticized Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg for prosecuting Penny. Bragg released a statement following the verdict, saying: \"As with every case, we followed the facts and the evidence from beginning to end. A Grand Jury voted to indict, and the Office carefully presented this case to a trial jury. \"Over the course of the trial, we introduced medical records, videos, bodycam footage, and testimony from over 30 witnesses, including from the City's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. \"The jury carefully deliberated for four days. They requested readbacks of testimony and asked for video footage to re-watch, as well as written definitions of the law. Their lengthy deliberation - and the totality of the facts and the evidence -- underscored why this case was put in front of a jury of Mr. Penny's peers. \"The jury has now spoken. At the Manhattan D.A.'s Office we deeply respect the jury process and we respect their verdict. \"Unfortunately, over the duration of this trial, talented career prosecutors and their family members were besieged with hate and threats -- on social media, by phone and over email. Simply put, this is unacceptable, and everyone, no matter your opinion on this case, should condemn it. These are prosecutors who have dedicated decades of their lives to public service and to the safety of Manhattan. I am grateful to them, as well as to the NYPD for their hard work and commitment on not only this matter, but for all they do on behalf of New Yorkers. I also want to thank Judge Wiley for presiding over this case. Finally, I want to thank the members of the jury who took time out of their lives to diligently evaluate the evidence.\" Mayor Eric Adams was asked by reporters if he thinks the verdict says anything about the mood of the city, and if he feels like it could open the door for maybe more of these interactions of people exacting their own justice. \"Good question. And I'll answer the latter first. Of what you see, of what people often do, a lot of people make interpretations, you know, about trials, but juries are in the courtroom. They're hearing every piece of evidence, they are hearing the testimonies. They have to make the decision. And that's the system that we have. And actually, it is probably one of the best systems on the globe. And I think the jury's heard the evidence and made a determination based on the evidence that they heard. And the ... does it impact what's going to happen throughout the city that people are not going to take action or going to take action? I don't think it does. \"I think that oftentimes people make these decisions when they are in the midst of it. And there's a desire of New Yorkers to help out those who are in need. There's a desire of New Yorkers is to always respond when they believe it's necessary. And I don't think that is going to change in any way. This is not the first time, and I'm sure it's not going to be the last time that individuals take actions and people are going to question about those actions that happened. \"But at the cornerstone and at the heart of this is that, of this young man, like so many others that are on our subway systems, I made it clear that's not a place to sleep, to live. That's not a place to be. And when they need help, we need to give them the help of that they have.\" In order to be convicted of manslaughter, prosecutors had to prove: In order to be convicted of criminally negligent homicide, prosecutors had to prove: Police and witnesses said Neely, 30, boarded an F train in SoHo on May 1, 2023 and began shouting, throwing things and making threats. Penny, a passenger on the train, approached Neely from behind and tried to restrain him. Video shows Penny holding Neely in a chokehold on the floor of the train for several minutes until Neely stopped moving. After police arrived, officers administered Narcan to Neely, performed CPR and used an AED, but were unable to revive him. Neely was pronounced dead at the scene. Police said Neely did not have any weapons on him. A medical examiner ruled Neely's death a homicide three days later, with the cause as compression of the neck. Toxicology reports showed Neely had synthetic marijuana in his system when he died. Neely was a street performer and Michael Jackson impersonator who was experiencing homelessness and had struggled with mental illness after his mother was murdered in 2007. Video of Penny holding Neely in the chokehold was widely circulated online. Neely's death sparked protests across New York City, with many raising concerns about the need for better mental health care in the city, and Neely's family called for Penny's arrest. Penny turned himself in on May 12, 2023, and was initially charged with second-degree manslaughter and released on $100,000 bail. He was arraigned in June and pleaded not guilty to criminally negligent homicide and second-degree manslaughter. Penny defended his actions, saying he was trying to protect other passengers on the train by restraining Neely. In late October 2024, a 12-person jury and four alternates were selected and sworn in. They included seven women and five men, with at least seven White people, one Hispanic person, one Filipino person, one Black person and one person of Middle Eastern descent. The trial began Nov. 1. The prosecution argued in their opening statements that Penny, though he had good intentions, recklessly used excessive force without trying any other means of deescalating the situation. The defense, meanwhile, argued Penny was protecting other passengers and there was no other way to deescalate due to Neely's behavior. Jurors heard testimony from multiple witnesses, including police officers, MTA employees, passengers on the train and a bystander who helped Penny restrain Neely. Penny's Marine Corps martial arts instructor and the medical examiner who performed Neely's autopsy also took the stand. The defense called Penny's mother and platoon sergeants as character witnesses, along with a forensic pathologist who said he disagreed with the medical examiner's cause of death. Jurors began their deliberations last Tuesday. They sent two notes back to the judge. The first requested a readback of part of the judge's instructions. The second note asked the judge if they could return for deliberations Wednesday, which is a day they would normally have had off. The judge approved that request. Wednesday morning, jurors sent another note, asking to see a video compilation of police bodycams from the incident, as well as footage of Penny's police station interview. Jurors also asked for readback of the medical examiner's cross-examination. Friday morning, on the fourth day of deliberations, they sent a note to the judge indicating they couldn't reach a unanimous verdict on his manslaughter charge.

                "title": "Daniel Penny found not guilty in NY subway chokehold death of Jordan Neely",
                "content": "A 26-year-old man has been acquitted of homicide for putting an unarmed homeless man in a fatal chokehold, a case that sparked weeks of protests and reignited debates over public safety, mental illness and race. Jurors deliberated for five days before declaring Daniel Penny not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in the death of 30-year-old Jordan Neely on a New York City subway train on 1 May 2023. The verdict comes after prosecutors agreed to drop a more serious charge of second-degree manslaughter on Friday, as jurors could not reach an agreement. The move allowed the jurors to move on to consider the second lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide. The verdict, announced on Monday, was met with loud applause in the Manhattan court. Mr Penny - who served four years in the Marines before studying architecture - appeared to smile while his attorneys hugged. \"We couldn't be more pleased that a jury of Danny's peers acquitted him of any wrongdoing,\" his lawyers said in a statement afterwards. \"New Yorkers can take some comfort in knowing that we can continue to stand up for one another without sacrificing our rights or our freedoms.\" Mr Neely's father, Andre Zachery, was removed from court for shouting after the verdict. Chants of \"no justice, no peace\" could be heard echoing outside. \"It hurts. It really, really hurts,\" Mr Zachery said outside court. \"What's gonna happen to us now? I've had enough of this.\" Mr Neely’s death sparked protests across the city and reignited debates over public transportation safety and how the city cares for those struggling with mental health issues and homelessness. Some also highlighted the issue of race - Mr Neely was black; Mr Penny is white. \"Jordan Neely was murdered,\" New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a left-wing Democrat, wrote on X at the time of his death, adding, \"he was houseless and crying for food in a time when the city is raising rents and stripping services\". But many conservatives defended Mr Penny's actions, saying he had stepped in to keep the public safe. On Monday, following the verdict, Vice-President-elect JD Vance wrote on X that \"it was a scandal Penny was ever prosecuted in the first place\". \"Thank God justice was done in this case,\" he said. Last spring, witnesses said that Mr Neely - who suffered from severe mental illnesses - began shouting at other subway passengers, asking for money and screaming that he was hungry and wanted to go back to jail. One woman on the train said that Mr Neely made lunging movements that scared her enough to shield her young child from him. Prosecutors said Mr Penny placed Mr Neely in a chokehold for six minutes, compressing his neck even after he stopped moving. They argued that Mr Penny had acted \"recklessly\" by restraining Mr Neely for several minutes even after he lost consciousness. \"He's dying,\" said an unseen bystander in one passenger's video. \"Let him go!\" Mr Penny's legal team argued that he only stepped in after Mr Neely began threatening passengers. They also cited testimony from a forensic pathologist who said Mr Neely could have died from other contributing factors. A medical examiner ruled Mr Neely's cause of death as compression to the neck. Mr Neely was a Michael Jackson impersonator who performed in Times Square. He had dozens of previous arrests on charges such as evading fares, theft and assaults on three women. Family members say his mental health issues began more than 15 years earlier, when his mother was strangled to death and stuffed in a suitcase by her boyfriend. In a statement released on Monday afternoon, Neely family attorney Donte Mills said they were \"devastated\". \"Everyone matters. Even if you're homeless, have mental health issues, have an addiction - you matter,\" Mr Mills said. \"This verdict says otherwise. Daniel Penny got away with murder.\" The manslaughter charge against Mr Penny would have carried a 15-year maximum sentence, while the negligent homicide charge carries a four-year-maximum. The 26-year-old was taken into custody at a McDonald's in Pennsylvania, in connection to the killing of United Health CEO Brian Thompson. The court says Murdoch acted in \"bad faith\" by trying to give control of his empire to his eldest son. A prosecutor says Luigi Mangione, 26, who was denied bail at an initial court appearance, is likely to be charged with homicide. President-elect Donald Trump's daughter-in-law announced the move amid speculation that she could be chosen to fill a potential Senate vacancy. The \"person of interest\" was detained on firearms charges at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

                "title": "Daniel Penny Verdict: Not Guilty in Jordan Neely Killing",
                "content": "By Jon Blistein Daniel Penny, the Marine veteran who killed Jordan Neely, a homeless man known as a Michael Jackson impersonator around New York City, was found not guilty on a charge of criminally negligent homicide. The verdict was reached after four days of deliberations, during which the more serious charge against Penny, second-degree manslaughter, was dismissed. Last Friday morning, Dec. 6, after three days of deliberations, the jury sent Judge Maxwell Wiley a note saying they were deadlocked on the manslaughter charge. While Wiley encouraged the jury to keep deliberating, that afternoon they sent a second note saying they still could not reach an unanimous decision. Penny’s lawyers argued the impasse called for a mistrial. But Wiley instead granted a motion from the prosecution to dismiss the manslaughter charge and allow deliberations to continue on the criminally negligent homicide charge. The verdict delivered Monday, Dec. 9, found that Penny’s actions were not criminal when he held Neely in a chokehold for several minutes on the floor of a subway car on May 1, 2023. After the verdict was read, per The New York Times, Penny’s lawyer, Thomas A. Kenniff, reportedly hugged Penny. Neely’s father, Andre Zachery, reportedly started yelling at Penny’s supporters, and the judge had to ask him to leave the room. Penny was accused of killing Neely, who was unhoused and had a history of mental health issues, on May 1, 2023. Neely boarded an uptown F train in Manhattan and reportedly started yelling and acting erratically. Some witnesses said he screamed that he was hungry, that he wanted to go back to jail, and that he did not care if he lived or died. Some on the subway car claimed Neely threatened to hurt others on the train. Others said they didn’t hear Neely make any threats. Penny came up behind Neely and put him in a chokehold that lasted about six minutes. According to reports, Neely stopped moving about five minutes into Penny’s restraint. When police arrived on the scene at the next subway station, Neely reportedly had a faint pulse but was not breathing. Police tried CPR but were unsuccessful. Neely was pronounced dead at a hospital about an hour later. Editor’s picks The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time While Penny was taken into custody and questioned, he was ultimately released. On May 4, the medical examiner ruled Neely’s death a homicide, saying he died of compression to his neck caused by the chokehold. Prosecutors finally brought charges against Penny on May 12, 11 days after Neely’s death. Neely pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. For their case, prosecutors did not try to argue that Penny intentionally killed Neely. In fact, during opening arguments, Assistant District Attorney Dana Yoran said Penny’s initial efforts to restrain Neely may have been “even laudable” (via The New York Times). But prosecutors said Penny acted carelessly and should’ve known his actions could have resulted in Neely’s death. They pointed to his Marine training, that he continued to hold Neely in a chokehold even after Neely had stopped moving, and even cited others on the train who warned Penny that he might kill Neely if he did not let go. “Under the law, deadly physical force such as a chokehold is permitted only when it is absolutely necessary, and only for as long as it is absolutely necessary,” Yoran said in her opening statement. “And here, the defendant went way too far.” For his defense, Penny’s lawyers claimed their client’s actions were a justified use of force to defend himself or others on the train. They also tried to contend that despite the medical examiner’s ruling, it was not Penny’s chokehold that killed Neely, but rather Neely’s schizophrenia, marijuana use, and sickle cell trait that led to his death.

This week on Bella-stone... Bella Hadid stunned Yellowstone viewers by making an unexpected cameo on the Dec. 8 episode of the Paramount+ series' final season alongside her professional cowboy boyfriend Adan Banuelos. The model played the role of Sadie, the girlfriend of horse trainer Travis Wheatley, who is played by series creator Taylor Sheridan. The 28-year-old first appeared in the episode answering the door in a cowboy hat and tank top at Travis' Texas ranch after Kelly Reilly's character Beth Dutton shows up for a horse auction and instead finds the group—which includes Adan—playing strip poker. In a subsequent scene, Beth questions why Sadie is dating Travis, who she deems \"misogynistic,\" \"condescending\" and \"the most arrogant man\" she's ever met. She also notes that he's 25 years older than Bella's character. After Sadie asks her if she's \"ever seen him ride before,\" the duo watches him get on a horse, which prompts Beth to admit, \"OK, yeah, I get it.\" Bella—who used to compete in equestrian competitions—put her own skills on display later in the episode when her character rides around during a horse auction at the Yellowstone ranch. Yellowstone viewers were stunned by the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum's cameo, with one person saying that it \"definitely wasn't on my 2024 bingo card.\" Another person joked that \"bella hadid takes that cowboy s--t for real serious cause why is she playing strip poker with taylor sheridan on yellowstone right now.\" A third user called it \"objectively hilarious\" that Yellowstone's creator cast a model as his character's girlfriend on the show. Bella's cowgirl cameo comes over a year into her relationship with Adan, who she was first linked to when they were spotted making out with one another in October 2023. The Victoria's Secret model made thie relationship Instagram official back in February. Just a couple months later, she revealed that she'd moved to Texas—where Adan lives—after becoming disillusioned with modeling. \"After 10 years of modeling,\" Bella told Allure in April, \"I realized I was putting so much energy and love and effort into something that, in the long run, wasn't necessarily giving it back to me.\" The couple did return to New York for an appearance together, though, when they rode horses alongside one another outside of the Horse Sense premiere in Manhattan. \"My love brought Texas to NYC,\" Bella captioned an Instagram carousel post from the event Sept. 17. \"Lucky me.\" Keep reading for the fate of other fan-favorite shows amid Yellowstone's final season.

                "title": "Bella Hadid Showed Up on ‘Yellowstone’ For Some Reason",
                "content": "Manage your account WE'RE IN CRUNCH time on what just may be the final season of Yellowstone; the only episode left to air is season 5, episode 14, which just might be the series finale (though Paramount Network's marketing has yet to refer to it as that). There are several storylines still open, several mysteries still to be solved, and several characters desperately needing closure. So, with time running out, what does Yellowstone co-creator and showrunner Taylor Sheridan do? Well, of course, he gives the character played by Taylor Sheridan a whole bunch of screen time and a never-before-seen girlfriend played by a famous supermodel, that's what! Look, guys. At this point, you have to kind of realize that with Yellowstone, this is part of the deal. Sheridan is without a doubt a talented screenwriter; his work on movies like Sicario and Hell or High Water proved that without question. If you want tightly-crafted TV stories from Taylor Sheridan, you can look to something like Lioness or the Yellowstone spinoffs 1883 and 1923. For the last couple years, Sheridan has treated Yellowstone kind of like his free jazz project, with storylines and character beats that come out of nowhere and stop as quickly as they start. He's trying things, and doing whatever he wants—and, look, he made this show into a massive hit, so who could blame him? Sheridan's character on Yellowstone is Travis Wheatley, a famous horse trainer and friend of Rip (Cole Hauser) who's been a recurring character on the show since the very first season. He's always popped in and out, but in season 5, episode 13, titled \"Give the World Away,\" we get to see more of Travis than ever before as Beth travels to his ranch as they try to get his help to sell the Dutton Ranch horses for as much as they possibly can. We already knew that Travis was an expert-level horse trainer, but our extended screen time in this episode showed that he also owns and runs his own ranch, plays a seemingly-constant game of strip poker with younger women in various states of undress, is an expert showman and deceptive salesman, and has a girlfriend played by supermodel Bella Hadid. To Sheridan's credit, while he does write his own character as essentially the best and coolest guy in the world, he does at least make Beth (Kelly Reilly) skeptical. While watching Travis ride and showcase the horses being sold, she asks Sadie (the Bella Hadid character) what, exactly she's doing; he's arrogant, condescending, misogynistic, and 25 years older than her. What is the deal? Sadie doesn't hesitate, and also doesn't deny anything Beth said. But she tells her exactly what it is she is drawn to: he's one hell of a horse-rider. And they both look on in awe, unable to deny his talent there. Ok then! Ultimately, Travis proves to be not only a great horse rider and salesman, but—after messing with Beth a little—a good guy who's willing to help out with the Dutton Ranch firesale. By the end of the episode, they've sold off all of their cattle, horses, and assets, making up $30 million, much thanks to Travis without a doubt. While we'll have to wait for the Yellowstone finale to learn the fate of the Duttons and the Yellowstone ranch, we can be sure of one thing: Travis is living the good life. If you thought Travis's girlfriend, Sadie, on Yellowstone looked familiar, that's because she's played by Bella Hadid—one of the most famous supermodels in the world. At the moment she has 61.5 million Instagram followers. If you're wondering why Bella Hadid made a random surprise guest appearance on Yellowstone as Travis's girlfriend, well, that's a pretty good question. But we've also got a pretty good answer. Bella Hadid's current boyfriend, Adan Banuelos, is a cowboy and horse-trainer in real life—and he also made a cameo in season 5, episode 13 of Yellowstone, as one of the dudes playing in Travis's strip poker game. Since the duo have been dating in the last year and change, she's shown up at all sorts of rodeo and horse-riding events, including at the 2024 American Performance Horseman competition that was held in Arlington, Texas back in March. In addition to her Western swing, Hadid has also begun dabbling in acting. While she's an experienced model and has previously appeared in music videos, she made her TV debut back in 2022 when she played a character named Lena in the third season of Hulu's acclaimed series Ramy. We know that Taylor Sheridan is good to his actors—maybe we'll see her again in one of his shows soon?

                "content": "Sections Shows More Follow today More Brands “Yellowstone” fans tuned in to see a surprise guest on the Dec. 8 episode of the hit drama when Bella Hadid made a cameo. Following a flurry of deaths on the show in recent weeks, the supermodel played the girlfriend of Travis Wheatley, a horse trainer portrayed by series creator Taylor Sheridan, who has appeared in nearly a dozen episodes during the show’s run. The pair’s interaction in the series’ penultimate episode before the finale definitely raised viewers’ eyebrows. So, what exactly happened? Hadid first appeared on the episode when Beth Dutton, played by Kelly Reilly, pays Travis a visit. She was taken aback, though, by Hadid’s character, Sadie, who opens the door. “You the masseuse?” Sadie asks, to which Beth fires back, “Do I look like a f------ masseuse?” “A very expensive one,” Sadie replies. Beth walks into the house and sees Travis engaged in a game of strip poker with a bunch of people, including one person played by Hadid’s real-life boyfriend, Adan Banuelos. Beth yells at Travis to go to a horse auction he is hosting where buyers are waiting, which is what brought her to Texas. Beth and Sadie interact again at the auction when Beth, who calls him “the most arrogant I’ve ever met in my life,” asks why Sadie is interested in Travis in the first place. “You ever seen him ride before?” Sadie asks. “OK, yeah, I get it,” Beth responds after watching him in the ring. Hadid appears again in the episode when she’s seen riding a horse. Hadid's role certainly had people talking on X, where the reactions ran the gamut. “Taylor Sheridan making Bella Hadid his girlfriend in ‘Yellowstone’ is objectively hilarious” one person wrote. “Taylor Sheridan writing in Bella Hadid as his girlfriend on Yellowstone is hilarious by the way (realest thing he’s ever done)” another person joked. “Bella Hadid on Yellowstone is the greatest addition to the show,” someone else commented. “I didn’t think Yellowstone could get any better … then I saw Bella Hadid,” another user raved. Other fans commented on Sheridan's appearance. Sheridan began his career as an actor, so stepping in front of the camera isn’t exactly new fare for him. In fact, he has made three appearances as Army Delta Force operator Cody Spears on “Lionness,” another Paramount+ series he created. But \"Yellowstone\" viewers used his appearance to comment on the direction the show is going in under his leadership. “I’ve got to believe that Taylor Sheridan is just as arrogant and obnoxious in real life as is his character on #Yellowstone. I’m not sure he’s acting,” someone chided. “All the abandoned plot-lines and people are still praising Taylor Sheridan like this isn’t the worst last season ever possible for Yellowstone. The show is garbage now,” another person criticized. “The Taylor Sheridan Midlife Crisis Episodes. I know it’s his show but this?? We’ve seen him numerous times on the show work with his horses and now we see his half naked juiced self? Very selfish of him to hog time from the real cast we care about,” a different viewer wrote. In May 2023, Paramount announced \"Yellowstone\" would end after its fifth and final season, although Sheridan is helming other ongoing spinoffs like \"1923.\" Drew Weisholtz is a reporter for TODAY Digital, focusing on pop culture, nostalgia and trending stories.

                "content": "An earthquake – also called a quake, tremor, or temblor – is the shaking of the Earth's surface resulting from a sudden release of energy in the lithosphere that creates seismic waves. Earthquakes can range in intensity, from those so weak they cannot be felt, to those violent enough to propel objects and people into the air, damage critical infrastructure, and wreak destruction across entire cities. The seismic activity of an area is the frequency, type, and size of earthquakes experienced over a particular time. The seismicity at a particular location in the Earth is the average rate of seismic energy release per unit volume. In its most general sense, the word earthquake is used to describe any seismic event that generates seismic waves. Earthquakes can occur naturally or be induced by human activities, such as mining, fracking, and nuclear tests. The initial point of rupture is called the hypocenter or focus, while the ground level directly above it is the epicenter. Earthquakes are primarily caused by geological faults, but also by volcanic activity, landslides, and other seismic events. The frequency, type, and size of earthquakes in an area define its seismic activity, reflecting the average rate of seismic energy release. Significant historical earthquakes include the 1556 Shaanxi earthquake in China, with over 830,000 fatalities, and the 1960 Valdivia earthquake in Chile, the largest ever recorded at 9.5 magnitude. Earthquakes result in various effects, such as ground shaking and soil liquefaction, leading to significant damage and loss of life. When the epicenter of a large earthquake is located offshore, the seabed may be displaced sufficiently to cause a tsunami. Earthquakes can trigger landslides. Earthquakes' occurrence is influenced by tectonic movements along faults, including normal, reverse (thrust), and strike-slip faults, with energy release and rupture dynamics governed by the elastic-rebound theory. Efforts to manage earthquake risks involve prediction, forecasting, and preparedness, including seismic retrofitting and earthquake engineering to design structures that withstand shaking. The cultural impact of earthquakes spans myths, religious beliefs, and modern media, reflecting their profound influence on human societies. Similar seismic phenomena, known as marsquakes and moonquakes, have been observed on other celestial bodies, indicating the universality of such events beyond Earth. An earthquake is the shaking of the surface of Earth resulting from a sudden release of energy in the lithosphere that creates seismic waves. Earthquakes may also be referred to as quakes, tremors, or temblors. The word tremor is also used for non-earthquake seismic rumbling. In its most general sense, an earthquake is any seismic event—whether natural or caused by humans—that generates seismic waves. Earthquakes are caused mostly by the rupture of geological faults but also by other events such as volcanic activity, landslides, mine blasts, fracking and nuclear tests. An earthquake's point of initial rupture is called its hypocenter or focus. The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter. The seismic activity of an area is the frequency, type, and size of earthquakes experienced over a particular time. The seismicity at a particular location in the Earth is the average rate of seismic energy release per unit volume. One of the most devastating earthquakes in recorded history was the 1556 Shaanxi earthquake, which occurred on 23 January 1556 in Shaanxi, China. More than 830,000 people died.[2] Most houses in the area were yaodongs—dwellings carved out of loess hillsides—and many victims were killed when these structures collapsed. The 1976 Tangshan earthquake, which killed between 240,000 and 655,000 people, was the deadliest of the 20th century.[3] The 1960 Chilean earthquake is the largest earthquake that has been measured on a seismograph, reaching 9.5 magnitude on 22 May 1960.[4][5] Its epicenter was near Cañete, Chile. The energy released was approximately twice that of the next most powerful earthquake, the Good Friday earthquake (27 March 1964), which was centered in Prince William Sound, Alaska.[6][7] The ten largest recorded earthquakes have all been megathrust earthquakes; however, of these ten, only the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake is simultaneously one of the deadliest earthquakes in history. Earthquakes that caused the greatest loss of life, while powerful, were deadly because of their proximity to either heavily populated areas or the ocean, where earthquakes often create tsunamis that can devastate communities thousands of kilometers away. Regions most at risk for great loss of life include those where earthquakes are relatively rare but powerful, and poor regions with lax, unenforced, or nonexistent seismic building codes. Tectonic earthquakes occur anywhere on the earth where there is sufficient stored elastic strain energy to drive fracture propagation along a fault plane. The sides of a fault move past each other smoothly and aseismically only if there are no irregularities or asperities along the fault surface that increases the frictional resistance. Most fault surfaces do have such asperities, which leads to a form of stick-slip behavior. Once the fault has locked, continued relative motion between the plates leads to increasing stress and, therefore, stored strain energy in the volume around the fault surface. This continues until the stress has risen sufficiently to break through the asperity, suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault, releasing the stored energy.[8] This energy is released as a combination of radiated elastic strain seismic waves,[9] frictional heating of the fault surface, and cracking of the rock, thus causing an earthquake. This process of gradual build-up of strain and stress punctuated by occasional sudden earthquake failure is referred to as the elastic-rebound theory. It is estimated that only 10 percent or less of an earthquake's total energy is radiated as seismic energy. Most of the earthquake's energy is used to power the earthquake fracture growth or is converted into heat generated by friction. Therefore, earthquakes lower the Earth's available elastic potential energy and raise its temperature, though these changes are negligible compared to the conductive and convective flow of heat out from the Earth's deep interior.[10] There are three main types of fault, all of which may cause an interplate earthquake: normal, reverse (thrust), and strike-slip. Normal and reverse faulting are examples of dip-slip, where the displacement along the fault is in the direction of dip and where movement on them involves a vertical component. Many earthquakes are caused by movement on faults that have components of both dip-slip and strike-slip; this is known as oblique slip. The topmost, brittle part of the Earth's crust, and the cool slabs of the tectonic plates that are descending into the hot mantle, are the only parts of our planet that can store elastic energy and release it in fault ruptures. Rocks hotter than about 300 °C (572 °F) flow in response to stress; they do not rupture in earthquakes.[11][12] The maximum observed lengths of ruptures and mapped faults (which may break in a single rupture) are approximately 1,000 km (620 mi). Examples are the earthquakes in Alaska (1957), Chile (1960), and Sumatra (2004), all in subduction zones. The longest earthquake ruptures on strike-slip faults, like the San Andreas Fault (1857, 1906), the North Anatolian Fault in Turkey (1939), and the Denali Fault in Alaska (2002), are about half to one third as long as the lengths along subducting plate margins, and those along normal faults are even shorter. Normal faults occur mainly in areas where the crust is being extended such as a divergent boundary. Earthquakes associated with normal faults are generally less than magnitude 7. Maximum magnitudes along many normal faults are even more limited because many of them are located along spreading centers, as in Iceland, where the thickness of the brittle layer is only about six kilometres (3.7 mi).[13][14] Reverse faults occur in areas where the crust is being shortened such as at a convergent boundary. Reverse faults, particularly those along convergent boundaries, are associated with the most powerful earthquakes (called megathrust earthquakes) including almost all of those of magnitude 8 or more. Megathrust earthquakes are responsible for about 90% of the total seismic moment released worldwide.[15] Strike-slip faults are steep structures where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other; transform boundaries are a particular type of strike-slip fault. Strike-slip faults, particularly continental transforms, can produce major earthquakes up to about magnitude 8. Strike-slip faults tend to be oriented near vertically, resulting in an approximate width of 10 km (6.2 mi) within the brittle crust.[16] Thus, earthquakes with magnitudes much larger than 8 are not possible. In addition, there exists a hierarchy of stress levels in the three fault types. Thrust faults are generated by the highest, strike-slip by intermediate, and normal faults by the lowest stress levels.[17] This can easily be understood by considering the direction of the greatest principal stress, the direction of the force that \"pushes\" the rock mass during the faulting. In the case of normal faults, the rock mass is pushed down in a vertical direction, thus the pushing force (greatest principal stress) equals the weight of the rock mass itself. In the case of thrusting, the rock mass \"escapes\" in the direction of the least principal stress, namely upward, lifting the rock mass, and thus, the overburden equals the least principal stress. Strike-slip faulting is intermediate between the other two types described above. This difference in stress regime in the three faulting environments can contribute to differences in stress drop during faulting, which contributes to differences in the radiated energy, regardless of fault dimensions. For every unit increase in magnitude, there is a roughly thirty-fold increase in the energy released. For instance, an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 releases approximately 32 times more energy than a 5.0 magnitude earthquake and a 7.0 magnitude earthquake releases 1,000 times more energy than a 5.0 magnitude earthquake. An 8.6-magnitude earthquake releases the same amount of energy as 10,000 atomic bombs of the size used in World War II.[18] This is so because the energy released in an earthquake, and thus its magnitude, is proportional to the area of the fault that ruptures[19] and the stress drop. Therefore, the longer the length and the wider the width of the faulted area, the larger the resulting magnitude. The most important parameter controlling the maximum earthquake magnitude on a fault, however, is not the maximum available length, but the available width because the latter varies by a factor of 20. Along converging plate margins, the dip angle of the rupture plane is very shallow, typically about 10 degrees.[20] Thus, the width of the plane within the top brittle crust of the Earth can reach 50–100 km (31–62 mi) (such as in Japan, 2011, or in Alaska, 1964), making the most powerful earthquakes possible. The majority of tectonic earthquakes originate in the Ring of Fire at depths not exceeding tens of kilometers. Earthquakes occurring at a depth of less than 70 km (43 mi) are classified as \"shallow-focus\" earthquakes, while those with a focal depth between 70 and 300 km (43 and 186 mi) are commonly termed \"mid-focus\" or \"intermediate-depth\" earthquakes. In subduction zones, where older and colder oceanic crust descends beneath another tectonic plate, deep-focus earthquakes may occur at much greater depths (ranging from 300 to 700 km (190 to 430 mi)).[21] These seismically active areas of subduction are known as Wadati–Benioff zones. Deep-focus earthquakes occur at a depth where the subducted lithosphere should no longer be brittle, due to the high temperature and pressure. A possible mechanism for the generation of deep-focus earthquakes is faulting caused by olivine undergoing a phase transition into a spinel structure.[22] Earthquakes often occur in volcanic regions and are caused there, both by tectonic faults and the movement of magma in volcanoes. Such earthquakes can serve as an early warning of volcanic eruptions, as during the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens.[23] Earthquake swarms can serve as markers for the location of the flowing magma throughout the volcanoes. These swarms can be recorded by seismometers and tiltmeters (a device that measures ground slope) and used as sensors to predict imminent or upcoming eruptions.[24] A tectonic earthquake begins as an area of initial slip on the fault surface that forms the focus. Once the rupture has been initiated, it begins to propagate away from the focus, spreading out along the fault surface. Lateral propagation will continue until either the rupture reaches a barrier, such as the end of a fault segment, or a region on the fault where there is insufficient stress to allow continued rupture. For larger earthquakes, the depth extent of rupture will be constrained downwards by the brittle-ductile transition zone and upwards by the ground surface. The mechanics of this process are poorly understood because it is difficult either to recreate such rapid movements in a laboratory or to record seismic waves close to a nucleation zone due to strong ground motion.[25] In most cases, the rupture speed approaches, but does not exceed, the shear wave (S wave) velocity of the surrounding rock. There are a few exceptions to this: Supershear earthquake ruptures are known to have propagated at speeds greater than the S wave velocity. These have so far all been observed during large strike-slip events. The unusually wide zone of damage caused by the 2001 Kunlun earthquake has been attributed to the effects of the sonic boom developed in such earthquakes. Slow earthquake ruptures travel at unusually low velocities. A particularly dangerous form of slow earthquake is the tsunami earthquake, observed where the relatively low felt intensities, caused by the slow propagation speed of some great earthquakes, fail to alert the population of the neighboring coast, as in the 1896 Sanriku earthquake.[25] During an earthquake, high temperatures can develop at the fault plane, increasing pore pressure and consequently vaporization of the groundwater already contained within the rock.[27][28][29] In the coseismic phase, such an increase can significantly affect slip evolution and speed, in the post-seismic phase it can control the Aftershock sequence because, after the main event, pore pressure increase slowly propagates into the surrounding fracture network.[30][29] From the point of view of the Mohr-Coulomb strength theory, an increase in fluid pressure reduces the normal stress acting on the fault plane that holds it in place, and fluids can exert a lubricating effect. As thermal overpressurization may provide positive feedback between slip and strength fall at the fault plane, a common opinion is that it may enhance the faulting process instability. After the mainshock, the pressure gradient between the fault plane and the neighboring rock causes a fluid flow that increases pore pressure in the surrounding fracture networks; such an increase may trigger new faulting processes by reactivating adjacent faults, giving rise to aftershocks.[30][29] Analogously, artificial pore pressure increase, by fluid injection in Earth's crust, may induce seismicity. Tides may trigger some seismicity. Most earthquakes form part of a sequence, related to each other in terms of location and time.[31] Most earthquake clusters consist of small tremors that cause little to no damage, but there is a theory that earthquakes can recur in a regular pattern.[32] Earthquake clustering has been observed, for example, in Parkfield, California where a long-term research study is being conducted around the Parkfield earthquake cluster.[33] An aftershock is an earthquake that occurs after a previous earthquake, the mainshock. Rapid changes of stress between rocks, and the stress from the original earthquake are the main causes of these aftershocks,[34] along with the crust around the ruptured fault plane as it adjusts to the effects of the mainshock.[31] An aftershock is in the same region as the main shock but always of a smaller magnitude, however, they can still be powerful enough to cause even more damage to buildings that were already previously damaged from the mainshock.[34] If an aftershock is larger than the mainshock, the aftershock is redesignated as the mainshock and the original main shock is redesignated as a foreshock. Aftershocks are formed as the crust around the displaced fault plane adjusts to the effects of the mainshock.[31] Earthquake swarms are sequences of earthquakes striking in a specific area within a short period. They are different from earthquakes followed by a series of aftershocks by the fact that no single earthquake in the sequence is the main shock, so none has a notably higher magnitude than another. An example of an earthquake swarm is the 2004 activity at Yellowstone National Park.[35] In August 2012, a swarm of earthquakes shook Southern California's Imperial Valley, showing the most recorded activity in the area since the 1970s.[36] Sometimes a series of earthquakes occur in what has been called an earthquake storm, where the earthquakes strike a fault in clusters, each triggered by the shaking or stress redistribution of the previous earthquakes. Similar to aftershocks but on adjacent segments of fault, these storms occur over the course of years, with some of the later earthquakes as damaging as the early ones. Such a pattern was observed in the sequence of about a dozen earthquakes that struck the North Anatolian Fault in Turkey in the 20th century and has been inferred for older anomalous clusters of large earthquakes in the Middle East.[37][38] It is estimated that around 500,000 earthquakes occur each year, detectable with current instrumentation. About 100,000 of these can be felt.[4][5] Minor earthquakes occur very frequently around the world in places like California and Alaska in the U.S., as well as in El Salvador, Mexico, Guatemala, Chile, Peru, Indonesia, the Philippines, Iran, Pakistan, the Azores in Portugal, Turkey, New Zealand, Greece, Italy, India, Nepal, and Japan.[40] Larger earthquakes occur less frequently, the relationship being exponential; for example, roughly ten times as many earthquakes larger than magnitude 4 occur than earthquakes larger than magnitude 5.[41] In the (low seismicity) United Kingdom, for example, it has been calculated that the average recurrences are: an earthquake of 3.7–4.6 every year, an earthquake of 4.7–5.5 every 10 years, and an earthquake of 5.6 or larger every 100 years.[42] This is an example of the Gutenberg–Richter law. The number of seismic stations has increased from about 350 in 1931 to many thousands today. As a result, many more earthquakes are reported than in the past, but this is because of the vast improvement in instrumentation, rather than an increase in the number of earthquakes. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimates that, since 1900, there have been an average of 18 major earthquakes (magnitude 7.0–7.9) and one great earthquake (magnitude 8.0 or greater) per year, and that this average has been relatively stable.[43] In recent years, the number of major earthquakes per year has decreased, though this is probably a statistical fluctuation rather than a systematic trend.[44] More detailed statistics on the size and frequency of earthquakes is available from the United States Geological Survey.[45] A recent increase in the number of major earthquakes has been noted, which could be explained by a cyclical pattern of periods of intense tectonic activity, interspersed with longer periods of low intensity. However, accurate recordings of earthquakes only began in the early 1900s, so it is too early to categorically state that this is the case.[46] Most of the world's earthquakes (90%, and 81% of the largest) take place in the 40,000-kilometre-long (25,000 mi), horseshoe-shaped zone called the circum-Pacific seismic belt, known as the Pacific Ring of Fire, which for the most part bounds the Pacific plate.[47][48] Massive earthquakes tend to occur along other plate boundaries too, such as along the Himalayan Mountains.[49] With the rapid growth of mega-cities such as Mexico City, Tokyo, and Tehran in areas of high seismic risk, some seismologists are warning that a single earthquake may claim the lives of up to three million people.[50] While most earthquakes are caused by the movement of the Earth's tectonic plates, human activity can also produce earthquakes. Activities both above ground and below may change the stresses and strains on the crust, including building reservoirs, extracting resources such as coal or oil, and injecting fluids underground for waste disposal or fracking.[51] Most of these earthquakes have small magnitudes. The 5.7 magnitude 2011 Oklahoma earthquake is thought to have been caused by disposing wastewater from oil production into injection wells,[52] and studies point to the state's oil industry as the cause of other earthquakes in the past century.[53] A Columbia University paper suggested that the 8.0 magnitude 2008 Sichuan earthquake was induced by loading from the Zipingpu Dam,[54] though the link has not been conclusively proved.[55] The instrumental scales used to describe the size of an earthquake began with the Richter scale in the 1930s. It is a relatively simple measurement of an event's amplitude, and its use has become minimal in the 21st century. Seismic waves travel through the Earth's interior and can be recorded by seismometers at great distances. The surface-wave magnitude was developed in the 1950s as a means to measure remote earthquakes and to improve the accuracy for larger events. The moment magnitude scale not only measures the amplitude of the shock but also takes into account the seismic moment (total rupture area, average slip of the fault, and rigidity of the rock). The Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale, the Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale, and the Mercalli intensity scale are based on the observed effects and are related to the intensity of shaking. The shaking of the earth is a common phenomenon that has been experienced by humans from the earliest of times. Before the development of strong-motion accelerometers, the intensity of a seismic event was estimated based on the observed effects. Magnitude and intensity are not directly related and calculated using different methods. The magnitude of an earthquake is a single value that describes the size of the earthquake at its source. Intensity is the measure of shaking at different locations around the earthquake. Intensity values vary from place to place, depending on the distance from the earthquake and the underlying rock or soil makeup.[56] The first scale for measuring earthquake magnitudes was developed by Charles Francis Richter in 1935. Subsequent scales (seismic magnitude scales) have retained a key feature, where each unit represents a ten-fold difference in the amplitude of the ground shaking and a 32-fold difference in energy. Subsequent scales are also adjusted to have approximately the same numeric value within the limits of the scale.[57] Although the mass media commonly reports earthquake magnitudes as \"Richter magnitude\" or \"Richter scale\", standard practice by most seismological authorities is to express an earthquake's strength on the moment magnitude scale, which is based on the actual energy released by an earthquake, the static seismic moment.[58][59] Every earthquake produces different types of seismic waves, which travel through rock with different velocities: Propagation velocity of the seismic waves through solid rock ranges from approx. 3 km/s (1.9 mi/s) up to 13 km/s (8.1 mi/s), depending on the density and elasticity of the medium. In the Earth's interior, the shock- or P waves travel much faster than the S waves (approx. relation 1.7:1). The differences in travel time from the epicenter to the observatory are a measure of the distance and can be used to image both sources of earthquakes and structures within the Earth. Also, the depth of the hypocenter can be computed roughly. P wave speed S waves speed As a consequence, the first waves of a distant earthquake arrive at an observatory via the Earth's mantle. On average, the kilometer distance to the earthquake is the number of seconds between the P- and S wave times 8.[60] Slight deviations are caused by inhomogeneities of subsurface structure. By such analysis of seismograms, the Earth's core was located in 1913 by Beno Gutenberg. S waves and later arriving surface waves do most of the damage compared to P waves. P waves squeeze and expand the material in the same direction they are traveling, whereas S waves shake the ground up and down and back and forth.[61] Earthquakes are not only categorized by their magnitude but also by the place where they occur. The world is divided into 754 Flinn–Engdahl regions (F-E regions), which are based on political and geographical boundaries as well as seismic activity. More active zones are divided into smaller F-E regions whereas less active zones belong to larger F-E regions. Standard reporting of earthquakes includes its magnitude, date and time of occurrence, geographic coordinates of its epicenter, depth of the epicenter, geographical region, distances to population centers, location uncertainty, several parameters that are included in USGS earthquake reports (number of stations reporting, number of observations, etc.), and a unique event ID.[62] Although relatively slow seismic waves have traditionally been used to detect earthquakes, scientists realized in 2016 that gravitational measurement could provide instantaneous detection of earthquakes, and confirmed this by analyzing gravitational records associated with the 2011 Tohoku-Oki (\"Fukushima\") earthquake.[63][64] The effects of earthquakes include, but are not limited to, the following: Shaking and ground rupture are the main effects created by earthquakes, principally resulting in more or less severe damage to buildings and other rigid structures. The severity of the local effects depends on the complex combination of the earthquake magnitude, the distance from the epicenter, and the local geological and geomorphological conditions, which may amplify or reduce wave propagation.[65] The ground-shaking is measured by ground acceleration. Specific local geological, geomorphological, and geostructural features can induce high levels of shaking on the ground surface even from low-intensity earthquakes. This effect is called site or local amplification. It is principally due to the transfer of the seismic motion from hard deep soils to soft superficial soils and the effects of seismic energy focalization owing to the typical geometrical setting of such deposits. Ground rupture is a visible breaking and displacement of the Earth's surface along the trace of the fault, which may be of the order of several meters in the case of major earthquakes. Ground rupture is a major risk for large engineering structures such as dams, bridges, and nuclear power stations and requires careful mapping of existing faults to identify any that are likely to break the ground surface within the life of the structure.[66] Soil liquefaction occurs when, because of the shaking, water-saturated granular material (such as sand) temporarily loses its strength and transforms from a solid to a liquid. Soil liquefaction may cause rigid structures, like buildings and bridges, to tilt or sink into the liquefied deposits. For example, in the 1964 Alaska earthquake, soil liquefaction caused many buildings to sink into the ground, eventually collapsing upon themselves.[67] Physical damage from an earthquake will vary depending on the intensity of shaking in a given area and the type of population. Underserved and developing communities frequently experience more severe impacts (and longer lasting) from a seismic event compared to well-developed communities.[68] Impacts may include: With these impacts and others, the aftermath may bring disease, a lack of basic necessities, mental consequences such as panic attacks and depression to survivors,[69] and higher insurance premiums. Recovery times will vary based on the level of damage and the socioeconomic status of the impacted community. Earthquakes can produce slope instability leading to landslides, a major geological hazard. Landslide danger may persist while emergency personnel is attempting rescue work.[70] Earthquakes can cause fires by damaging electrical power or gas lines. In the event of water mains rupturing and a loss of pressure, it may also become difficult to stop the spread of a fire once it has started. For example, more deaths in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake were caused by fire than by the earthquake itself.[71] Tsunamis are long-wavelength, long-period sea waves produced by the sudden or abrupt movement of large volumes of water—including when an earthquake occurs at sea. In the open ocean, the distance between wave crests can surpass 100 kilometres (62 mi), and the wave periods can vary from five minutes to one hour. Such tsunamis travel 600–800 kilometers per hour (373–497 miles per hour), depending on water depth. Large waves produced by an earthquake or a submarine landslide can overrun nearby coastal areas in a matter of minutes. Tsunamis can also travel thousands of kilometers across open ocean and wreak destruction on far shores hours after the earthquake that generated them.[72] Ordinarily, subduction earthquakes under magnitude 7.5 do not cause tsunamis, although some instances of this have been recorded. Most destructive tsunamis are caused by earthquakes of magnitude 7.5 or more.[72] Floods may be secondary effects of earthquakes if dams are damaged. Earthquakes may cause landslips to dam rivers, which collapse and cause floods.[73] The terrain below the Sarez Lake in Tajikistan is in danger of catastrophic flooding if the landslide dam formed by the earthquake, known as the Usoi Dam, were to fail during a future earthquake. Impact projections suggest the flood could affect roughly five million people.[74] Earthquake prediction is a branch of the science of seismology concerned with the specification of the time, location, and magnitude of future earthquakes within stated limits.[75] Many methods have been developed for predicting the time and place in which earthquakes will occur. Despite considerable research efforts by seismologists, scientifically reproducible predictions cannot yet be made to a specific day or month.[76] Popular belief holds earthquakes are preceded by earthquake weather, in the early morning.[77][78] While forecasting is usually considered to be a type of prediction, earthquake forecasting is often differentiated from earthquake prediction. Earthquake forecasting is concerned with the probabilistic assessment of general earthquake hazards, including the frequency and magnitude of damaging earthquakes in a given area over years or decades.[79] For well-understood faults the probability that a segment may rupture during the next few decades can be estimated.[80][81] Earthquake warning systems have been developed that can provide regional notification of an earthquake in progress, but before the ground surface has begun to move, potentially allowing people within the system's range to seek shelter before the earthquake's impact is felt. The objective of earthquake engineering is to foresee the impact of earthquakes on buildings, bridges, tunnels, roadways, and other structures, and to design such structures to minimize the risk of damage. Existing structures can be modified by seismic retrofitting to improve their resistance to earthquakes. Earthquake insurance can provide building owners with financial protection against losses resulting from earthquakes. Emergency management strategies can be employed by a government or organization to mitigate risks and prepare for consequences. Artificial intelligence may help to assess buildings and plan precautionary operations. The Igor expert system is part of a mobile laboratory that supports the procedures leading to the seismic assessment of masonry buildings and the planning of retrofitting operations on them. It has been applied to assess buildings in Lisbon, Rhodes, and Naples.[82] Individuals can also take preparedness steps like securing water heaters and heavy items that could injure someone, locating shutoffs for utilities, and being educated about what to do when the shaking starts. For areas near large bodies of water, earthquake preparedness encompasses the possibility of a tsunami caused by a large earthquake. From the lifetime of the Greek philosopher Anaxagoras in the 5th century BCE to the 14th century CE, earthquakes were usually attributed to \"air (vapors) in the cavities of the Earth.\"[83] Thales of Miletus (625–547 BCE) was the only documented person who believed that earthquakes were caused by tension between the earth and water.[83] Other theories existed, including the Greek philosopher Anaxamines' (585–526 BCE) beliefs that short incline episodes of dryness and wetness caused seismic activity. The Greek philosopher Democritus (460–371 BCE) blamed water in general for earthquakes.[83] Pliny the Elder called earthquakes \"underground thunderstorms\".[83] In Norse mythology, earthquakes were explained as the violent struggle of the god Loki. When Loki, god of mischief and strife, murdered Baldr, god of beauty and light, he was punished by being bound in a cave with a poisonous serpent placed above his head dripping venom. Loki's wife Sigyn stood by him with a bowl to catch the poison, but whenever she had to empty the bowl, the poison dripped on Loki's face, forcing him to jerk his head away and thrash against his bonds, which caused the earth to tremble.[84] In Greek mythology, Poseidon was the cause and god of earthquakes. When he was in a bad mood, he struck the ground with a trident, causing earthquakes and other calamities. He also used earthquakes to punish and inflict fear upon people as revenge.[85] In Japanese mythology, Namazu (鯰) is a giant catfish who causes earthquakes. Namazu lives in the mud beneath the earth and is guarded by the god Kashima, who restrains the fish with a stone. When Kashima lets his guard fall, Namazu thrashes about, causing violent earthquakes.[86] In the New Testament, Matthew's Gospel refers to earthquakes occurring both after the death of Jesus (Matthew 27:51, 54) and at his resurrection (Matthew 28:2).[87] Earthquakes form part of the picture through which Jesus portrays the beginning of the end of time.[88] In modern popular culture, the portrayal of earthquakes is shaped by the memory of great cities laid waste, such as Kobe in 1995 or San Francisco in 1906.[89] Fictional earthquakes tend to strike suddenly and without warning.[89] For this reason, stories about earthquakes generally begin with the disaster and focus on its immediate aftermath, as in Short Walk to Daylight (1972), The Ragged Edge (1968) or Aftershock: Earthquake in New York (1999).[89] A notable example is Heinrich von Kleist's classic novella, The Earthquake in Chile, which describes the destruction of Santiago in 1647. Haruki Murakami's short fiction collection After the Quake depicts the consequences of the Kobe earthquake of 1995. The most popular single earthquake in fiction is the hypothetical \"Big One\" expected of California's San Andreas Fault someday, as depicted in the novels Richter 10 (1996), Goodbye California (1977), 2012 (2009), and San Andreas (2015), among other works.[89] Jacob M. Appel's widely anthologized short story, A Comparative Seismology, features a con artist who convinces an elderly woman that an apocalyptic earthquake is imminent.[90] Contemporary depictions of earthquakes in film are variable in the manner in which they reflect human psychological reactions to the actual trauma that can be caused to directly afflicted families and their loved ones.[91] Disaster mental health response research emphasizes the need to be aware of the different roles of loss of family and key community members, loss of home and familiar surroundings, and loss of essential supplies and services to maintain survival.[92][93] Particularly for children, the clear availability of caregiving adults who can protect, nourish, and clothe them in the aftermath of the earthquake and help them make sense of what has befallen them is more important to their emotional and physical health than the simple giving of provisions.[94] As was observed after other disasters involving destruction and loss of life and their media depictions, recently observed in the 2010 Haiti earthquake, it is also believed to be important not to pathologize the reactions to loss and displacement or disruption of governmental administration and services, but rather to validate the reactions to support constructive problem-solving and reflection.[95] Phenomena similar to earthquakes have been observed on other planets (e.g., marsquakes on Mars) and on the Moon (e.g., moonquakes).",

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Over the centuries, earthquakes have been responsible for millions of deaths and an incalculable amount of damage to property. Depending on their intensity, earthquakes (specifically, the degree to which they cause the ground’s surface to shake) can topple buildings and bridges, rupture gas pipelines and other infrastructure, and trigger landslides, tsunamis, and volcanoes. These phenomena are primarily responsible for deaths and injuries. Very great earthquakes occur on average about once per year. Earthquake waves, more commonly known as seismic waves, are vibrations generated by an earthquake and propagated within Earth or along its surface. There are four principal types of elastic waves: two, primary and secondary waves, travel within Earth, whereas the other two, Rayleigh and Love waves, called surface waves, travel along its surface. In addition, seismic waves can be produced artificially by explosions. Magnitude is a measure of the amplitude (height) of the seismic waves an earthquake’s source produces as recorded by seismographs. Seismologist Charles F. Richter created an earthquake magnitude scale using the logarithm of the largest seismic wave’s amplitude to base 10. Richter’s scale was originally for measuring the magnitude of earthquakes from magnitudes 3 to 7, limiting its usefulness. Today the moment magnitude scale, a closer measure of an earthquake’s total energy release, is preferred. Earthquakes can occur anywhere, but they occur mainly along fault lines (planar or curved fractures in the rocks of Earth’s crust), where compressional or tensional forces move rocks on opposite sides of a fracture. Faults extend from a few centimetres to many hundreds of kilometres. In addition, most of the world’s earthquakes occur within the Ring of Fire, a long horseshoe-shaped belt of earthquake epicentres, volcanoes, and tectonic plate boundaries fringing the Pacific basin. earthquake, any sudden shaking of the ground caused by the passage of seismic waves through Earth’s rocks. Seismic waves are produced when some form of energy stored in Earth’s crust is suddenly released, usually when masses of rock straining against one another suddenly fracture and “slip.” Earthquakes occur most often along geologic faults, narrow zones where rock masses move in relation to one another. The major fault lines of the world are located at the fringes of the huge tectonic plates that make up Earth’s crust. (See the table of major earthquakes.) Little was understood about earthquakes until the emergence of seismology at the beginning of the 20th century. Seismology, which involves the scientific study of all aspects of earthquakes, has yielded answers to such long-standing questions as why and how earthquakes occur. About 50,000 earthquakes large enough to be noticed without the aid of instruments occur annually over the entire Earth. Of these, approximately 100 are of sufficient size to produce substantial damage if their centres are near areas of habitation. Very great earthquakes occur on average about once per year. Over the centuries they have been responsible for millions of deaths and an incalculable amount of damage to property. Earth’s major earthquakes occur mainly in belts coinciding with the margins of tectonic plates. This has long been apparent from early catalogs of felt earthquakes and is even more readily discernible in modern seismicity maps, which show instrumentally determined epicentres. The most important earthquake belt is the Circum-Pacific Belt, which affects many populated coastal regions around the Pacific Ocean—for example, those of New Zealand, New Guinea, Japan, the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, and the western coasts of North and South America. It is estimated that 80 percent of the energy presently released in earthquakes comes from those whose epicentres are in this belt. The seismic activity is by no means uniform throughout the belt, and there are a number of branches at various points. Because at many places the Circum-Pacific Belt is associated with volcanic activity, it has been popularly dubbed the “Pacific Ring of Fire.” A second belt, known as the Alpide Belt, passes through the Mediterranean region eastward through Asia and joins the Circum-Pacific Belt in the East Indies. The energy released in earthquakes from this belt is about 15 percent of the world total. There also are striking connected belts of seismic activity, mainly along oceanic ridges—including those in the Arctic Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, and the western Indian Ocean—and along the rift valleys of East Africa. This global seismicity distribution is best understood in terms of its plate tectonic setting. Earthquakes are caused by the sudden release of energy within some limited region of the rocks of the Earth. The energy can be released by elastic strain, gravity, chemical reactions, or even the motion of massive bodies. Of all these the release of elastic strain is the most important cause, because this form of energy is the only kind that can be stored in sufficient quantity in the Earth to produce major disturbances. Earthquakes associated with this type of energy release are called tectonic earthquakes.",

                "content": "An earthquake is when Earth's tectonic plates shake and move Earth's surface. Strong earthquakes damage buildings. Disturbances in the Earth cause earthquakes. Different tectonic plates are slowly moving. When they get stuck, tension builds up in them. Earthquakes occur when tectonic plates suddenly break free, so they start moving quickly. The first point of an earthquake's rupture is called its hypocenter or focus. The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter. People who study earthquakes are called seismologists. Many earthquakes can occur in a small area in a short period of time. The sudden release of stress in the tectonic plates sends waves of energy that travel through the Earth. Seismology studies the cause, recurrence, type and magnitude of earthquakes. The effect of an earthquake can be measured with a seismometer. A seismometer detects the tremors of the earth and plots the tremors on a seismograph. The strength or magnitude of an earthquake can be measured using the Richter scale. The Richter scale was invented by Charles Francis Richter in 1935. The scale is numbered 0-10. A 2 on this scale is a tremor that is not easily recorded. And damage of size 5 (or more) in a wide area. The largest earthquake ever measured had a magnitude of 9.5. No one can tell when an earthquake will happen. But we know where earthquakes are likely to occur in the future, such as near fault lines. An earthquake under the ocean can create a huge wave called a tsunami. Tsunamis can also cause a lot of destruction. Earthquake zones are concentrated in some parts of the world. The first is the Pacific belt, which circles the Pacific Ocean. This part is the biggest seismic belt: it has the most active earthquakes and the most volcanoes.[1] The second part is the Alpide belt. It includes the seismic activities from Sumatra, to the Himalayas, to south Europe and north Africa, to the Atlantic Ocean. These belts are along the edges of tectonic plates. The tectonic plates push on each other and make great amounts of tension. Earthquakes sometimes hit cities and kill hundreds or thousands of people. Most earthquakes happen along the Pacific Ring of Fire but the biggest ones mostly happen in other places. Tectonically active places are places where earthquakes or volcanic eruptions are regularly repeated. Earthquakes are caused by tectonic movements in the Earth's crust. The main cause is when tectonic plates ride one over the other, causing orogeny (mountain building), and severe earthquakes.[2] The boundaries between moving plates form the largest fault surfaces on Earth. When they stick, motion between the plates leads to increasing stress. This continues until the stress rises and breaks, suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault. This releases the stored energy as shock waves. The San Andreas fault in San Francisco, and Rift valley fault in Africa are faults like this. Earthquakes caused by volcanic eruptions can be quite devastating. However, these earthquakes are confined to areas around active volcanoes. Often the causes are not known, except in the most general terms. An example is the largest earthquake in the history of the United States: the 1811–1812 New Madrid earthquakes. These are described as caused by very deep shifts in ancient rock formations. In other words, the cause is not known in detail. In areas of intense mining activity, often the roofs of underground mines collapse and minor tremors take place. These are called collapse earthquakes. There are three main types of geological fault that may cause an earthquake: normal, reverse (thrust) and strike-slip. Normal faults occur mainly in areas where the crust is being extended. Reverse faults occur in areas where the crust is being shortened. Strike-slip faults are steep structures where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other. Most earthquakes form part of a sequence, related to each other in terms of location and time.[3] Most earthquake clusters consist of small tremors which cause little to no damage, but there is a theory that earthquakes can recur in a regular pattern.[4] A foreshock is an earthquake that happens before a larger earthquake, called the mainshock. An aftershock is an earthquake that happens after a previous earthquake, the mainshock. An aftershock is in the same place of the main shock but always of a smaller magnitude. Aftershocks are formed as the crust adjusts to the effects of the main shock.[3] Earthquake swarms are sequences of earthquakes striking in a specific area within a short period of time. They are different from earthquakes followed by a series of aftershocks by the fact that no single earthquake in the sequence is obviously the main shock, therefore none have notably higher magnitudes than the other. An example of an earthquake swarm is the 2004 activity at Yellowstone National Park.[5] Sometimes a series of earthquakes happen in a sort of earthquake storm, where the earthquakes strike a fault in clusters, each triggered by the shaking or stress redistribution of the previous earthquakes. Similar to aftershocks but on adjacent segments of fault, these storms happen over the course of years, and with some of the later earthquakes as damaging as the early ones. Such a pattern happened in the North Anatolian fault in Turkey in the 20th century.[6][7] A tsunami is a chain of fast moving waves in the ocean caused by powerful earthquakes. They are very serious challenges for people's safety and for earthquake engineering. Those waves can flood coastal areas, destroy houses and even swipe away whole towns.[8] This is a danger for the whole mankind. Unfortunately, tsunamis cannot be prevented. However, there are warning systems[9] which may warn the population before the big waves reach the land to let them enough time to rush to safety. Earthquake-proof buildings are constructed to withstand the destructive force of an earthquake. This depends upon its type of construction, shape, mass distribution, and rigidity. Different combinations are used. Square, rectangular, and shell-shaped buildings can withstand earthquakes better than skyscrapers. To reduce stress, a building's ground floor can be supported by extremely rigid, empty columns, while the rest of the building is supported by flexible columns inside the empty columns. Another method is to use rollers or rubber pads to separate the base columns from the ground, allowing the columns to shake parallel to each other during an earthquake. To help prevent a roof from collapsing, builders make the roof out of light-weight materials. Outdoor walls are made with stronger and more reinforced materials such as steel or reinforced concrete. During an earthquake, flexible windows may help hold the windows together so they don't break.",

Latest Earthquakes | Chat Share Social Media Originally written by Lisa Wald (U.S. Geological Survey) for “The Green Frog News” An earthquake is what happens when two blocks of the earth suddenly slip past one another. The surface where they slip is called the fault or fault plane. The location below the earth’s surface where the earthquake starts is called the hypocenter, and the location directly above it on the surface of the earth is called the epicenter. Sometimes an earthquake has foreshocks. These are smaller earthquakes that happen in the same place as the larger earthquake that follows. Scientists can’t tell that an earthquake is a foreshock until the larger earthquake happens. The largest, main earthquake is called the mainshock. Mainshocks always have aftershocks that follow. These are smaller earthquakes that occur afterwards in the same place as the mainshock. Depending on the size of the mainshock, aftershocks can continue for weeks, months, and even years after the mainshock! The earth has four major layers: the inner core, outer core, mantle and crust. The crust and the top of the mantle make up a thin skin on the surface of our planet. But this skin is not all in one piece – it is made up of many pieces like a puzzle covering the surface of the earth. Not only that, but these puzzle pieces keep slowly moving around, sliding past one another and bumping into each other. We call these puzzle pieces tectonic plates, and the edges of the plates are called the plate boundaries. The plate boundaries are made up of many faults, and most of the earthquakes around the world occur on these faults. Since the edges of the plates are rough, they get stuck while the rest of the plate keeps moving. Finally, when the plate has moved far enough, the edges unstick on one of the faults and there is an earthquake. While the edges of faults are stuck together, and the rest of the block is moving, the energy that would normally cause the blocks to slide past one another is being stored up. When the force of the moving blocks finally overcomes the friction of the jagged edges of the fault and it unsticks, all that stored up energy is released. The energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions in the form of seismic waves like ripples on a pond. The seismic waves shake the earth as they move through it, and when the waves reach the earth’s surface, they shake the ground and anything on it, like our houses and us! Earthquakes are recorded by instruments called seismographs. The recording they make is called a seismogram. The seismograph has a base that sets firmly in the ground, and a heavy weight that hangs free. When an earthquake causes the ground to shake, the base of the seismograph shakes too, but the hanging weight does not. Instead the spring or string that it is hanging from absorbs all the movement. The difference in position between the shaking part of the seismograph and the motionless part is what is recorded. The size of an earthquake depends on the size of the fault and the amount of slip on the fault, but that’s not something scientists can simply measure with a measuring tape since faults are many kilometers deep beneath the earth’s surface. So how do they measure an earthquake? They use the seismogram recordings made on the seismographs at the surface of the earth to determine how large the earthquake was (figure 5). A short wiggly line that doesn’t wiggle very much means a small earthquake, and a long wiggly line that wiggles a lot means a large earthquake. The length of the wiggle depends on the size of the fault, and the size of the wiggle depends on the amount of slip. The size of the earthquake is called its magnitude. There is one magnitude for each earthquake. Scientists also talk about theintensity of shaking from an earthquake, and this varies depending on where you are during the earthquake. Seismograms come in handy for locating earthquakes too, and being able to see the P wave and the S wave is important. You learned how P & S waves each shake the ground in different ways as they travel through it. P waves are also faster than S waves, and this fact is what allows us to tell where an earthquake was. To understand how this works, let’s compare P and S waves to lightning and thunder. Light travels faster than sound, so during a thunderstorm you will first see the lightning and then you will hear the thunder. If you are close to the lightning, the thunder will boom right after the lightning, but if you are far away from the lightning, you can count several seconds before you hear the thunder. The further you are from the storm, the longer it will take between the lightning and the thunder. P waves are like the lightning, and S waves are like the thunder. The P waves travel faster and shake the ground where you are first. Then the S waves follow and shake the ground also. If you are close to the earthquake, the P and S wave will come one right after the other, but if you are far away, there will be more time between the two. By looking at the amount of time between the P and S wave on a seismogram recorded on a seismograph, scientists can tell how far away the earthquake was from that location. However, they can’t tell in what direction from the seismograph the earthquake was, only how far away it was. If they draw a circle on a map around the station where the radius of the circle is the determined distance to the earthquake, they know the earthquake lies somewhere on the circle. But where? Scientists then use a method called triangulation to determine exactly where the earthquake was (see image below). It is called triangulation because a triangle has three sides, and it takes three seismographs to locate an earthquake. If you draw a circle on a map around three different seismographs where the radius of each is the distance from that station to the earthquake, the intersection of those three circles is the epicenter! No, and it is unlikely they will ever be able to predict them. Scientists have tried many different ways of predicting earthquakes, but none have been successful. On any particular fault, scientists know there will be another earthquake sometime in the future, but they have no way of telling when it will happen. These are two questions that do not yet have definite answers. If weather does affect earthquake occurrence, or if some animals or people can tell when an earthquake is coming, we do not yet understand how it works. Children's Privacy Policy",

                "title": "Joe Burrow - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Joseph Lee Burrow (born December 10, 1996) is an American professional football quarterback for the Cincinnati Bengals of the National Football League (NFL). After beginning his college football career with the Ohio State Buckeyes, Burrow played for the LSU Tigers, winning the Heisman Trophy and the College Football Playoff National Championship as a senior. He was selected by the Bengals first overall in the 2020 NFL draft. Burrow had a breakout season in 2021 when he led the Bengals to their first playoff win since 1990, ending the longest active drought in the four major North American sports, and an appearance in Super Bowl LVI. The following year, he led the Bengals to their first consecutive division title in franchise history. Burrow has been nicknamed \"Joe Cool\" and \"Joe Brrr\" by sportswriters and other players for his calmness under pressure. Ahead of the 2023 season, Burrow signed an extension with the Bengals, with the contract being the largest in NFL history in terms of annual salary at the time of the signing. Burrow was born in Ames, Iowa, on December 10, 1996,[1][2][3] the son of Robin and Jim Burrow. Jim is a former football player and coach whose career lasted over 40 years.[4] Burrow was born in Ames when his father was on the coaching staff at Iowa State University.[5] According to a 2019 Sports Illustrated story, \"The Burrow athletic lineage dates back nearly a century.\" In the 1940s, his paternal grandmother set a Mississippi state high school record with an 82-point game in basketball.[6][7] His paternal grandfather played basketball at Mississippi State; his uncle, John Burrow, played football at Ole Miss (the University of Mississippi); and two older brothers also played football at Nebraska.[8] He attended the 2002 Rose Bowl at age five, because his father was an assistant coach for the University of Nebraska in Lincoln. Not long after, he began playing in youth football leagues. Unlike his father, uncle, and brothers, who all played on defense, Burrow started out as a quarterback, because his first youth team had no one else who could play the position.[8] The Burrow family moved to North Dakota in 2003 when his father was hired as the defensive coordinator at North Dakota State University in Fargo. One day, while Jim was visiting his office, future Central Michigan head coach Dan Enos commented that the seven-year-old Joe had a future in football.[9] The Burrows spent two years in Fargo before Jim accepted the defensive coordinator position at Ohio University in Athens.[10] Burrow attended Athens High School (2011–14) in The Plains, Ohio, leading the school to three straight playoff appearances and the school's first seven playoff victories in school history.[11] During his career, he passed for 11,416 yards with 157 passing touchdowns and rushed for 2,067 yards with 27 rushing touchdowns.[12] He was awarded the state's Mr. Football Award and Gatorade Player of the Year award as a senior in 2014. He and his Bulldog teammates went 14–1 that season. He was also a standout basketball player, and was named first-team all-state at point guard his senior year.[11] Burrow was rated as a four-star football recruit, and was the eighth-highest ranked dual-threat quarterback in the class of 2015, according to the 247Sports Composite.[13] He committed to Ohio State to play football on May 27, 2014.[14][15] In December 2019, the Athens City School District school board unanimously approved a measure to rename the school's football stadium in honor of Burrow.[16] Burrow's connection with the area remains strong as such that during the 2020 NFL Draft, he wore a T-shirt with the number 740 in reference to the area code for Athens as well as Appalachian Ohio in general.[17] After redshirting his first year at Ohio State in 2015, Burrow spent the next two years as a backup to J. T. Barrett, during which he played in 10 games, completing 29 of 39 passes for 287 yards and two touchdowns.[18] During Ohio State's spring game in 2018, Burrow completed 15 of 22 pass attempts for 238 yards and two touchdowns.[19] The game was further part of Ohio State's competition for the starting quarterback position, contested by Burrow, Barrett, and Dwayne Haskins.[19] Following the game, Burrow told reporters \"I didn't come here to sit on the bench for four years. I know I'm a pretty good quarterback. I want to play somewhere.\"[19] Realizing that Haskins would be named starting quarterback at Ohio State, Burrow transferred to Louisiana State University (LSU) on May 18, 2018.[20][21] Burrow had graduated from Ohio State in three years with a degree in consumer and family financial services, and would be immediately eligible as a graduate transfer.[22] In his first year at LSU, Burrow was named the starting quarterback as a redshirt junior in 2018.[22] In an early season road trip to then-No. 7 Auburn, Burrow threw for 249 yards and a touchdown en route to a 22–21 win. He was named the Southeastern Conference (SEC) Offensive Player of the Week following the victory.[23] He again earned SEC Offensive Player of the Week honors following a 292-yard, three-touchdown performance against Ole Miss two weeks later.[24] Burrow played in LSU's 7-overtime and 5-hour long loss to Texas A&M.[25] After the game, Burrow experienced fatigue and had to be receive IV therapy from trainers.[25] Burrow helped lead the Tigers to a 10–3 record, including a win over UCF in the Fiesta Bowl, and a No. 6 ranking in the final AP Poll.[26][27] Burrow finished the season with 2,894 yards passing, 16 touchdowns, and five interceptions. He added 399 rushing yards and seven rushing touchdowns.[28] Burrow was again named LSU's starting quarterback heading into his redshirt senior season in 2019. In the Tigers' season opener against Georgia Southern, Burrow threw for 278 yards and five touchdowns in a 55–3 win, and was later named SEC Co-Offensive Player of the Week (with Tua Tagovailoa).[29] In a Week 2 road trip to ninth-ranked Texas, Burrow threw for 471 yards, four touchdowns, and an interception in a 45–38 win. His 471 yards were the second-most in school history and the most since Rohan Davey's 528 against Alabama in 2001.[30] He was named Walter Camp National Offensive Player of the Week and SEC Offensive Player of the Week following the performance.[31] Burrow earned his third SEC Offensive Player of the Week honors on September 21 during LSU's game against Vanderbilt. He threw for 398 yards and a school-record six passing touchdowns in the Tigers' 66–38 win.[32] He became the first LSU quarterback to throw for over 350 yards in three consecutive games.[33] In a 42–6 win over Utah State, Burrow threw for 344 yards and five touchdowns, and became the first Tiger quarterback to throw for 300-plus yards in four consecutive games.[34] The streak came to an end the next week against seventh-ranked Florida, but Burrow's 293 yards and three touchdown passes helped lead the Tigers to another win, 42–28.[35] The next week, in LSU's seventh game of the season, Burrow eclipsed the LSU single-season passing touchdowns record of 28 when he added four more in a win against Mississippi State.[36] In their next game, Burrow led LSU against ninth-ranked Auburn and LSU defeated another top 10 opponent, as Burrow's 321-yard, two-total-touchdowns performance set a new school record of eight career 300-yard games.[37] When LSU played Alabama on November 9, the two schools were ranked higher than they had been since they had played in the 2012 BCS National Championship Game; LSU was ranked second and Alabama third when the season's inaugural College Football Playoff rankings had been released the prior week. The game also featured two leading candidates for the Heisman Trophy in Burrow and Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa.[38] Burrow and the Tigers came away victorious in a 46–41 shootout. Burrow passed for 393 yards and three touchdowns in the game,[39] and was again named Walter Camp National Offensive Player of the Week and SEC Co-Offensive Player of the Week, sharing the latter with teammate Clyde Edwards-Helaire.[40] The following week against Ole Miss, Burrow threw for 489 yards and five touchdown passes, and his single-season passing yards surpassed the LSU record set by Rohan Davey in 2001. Burrow also set an LSU record for consecutive completed passes with 17 during the game.[41] On November 30, Burrow and LSU secured an undefeated regular season with a 50–7 win over Texas A&M, in which Burrow threw for 352 yards and three touchdowns. During the game, he broke the SEC record for single-season passing yards – previously set by Kentucky's Tim Couch – and tied the conference record for single-season touchdowns (which had been set by Missouri's Drew Lock).[42] Burrow took sole possession of the SEC single-season touchdown record the following week in the SEC Championship Game, throwing for four touchdowns in LSU's 37–10 win over Georgia that secured the Tigers' place in the College Football Playoff.[43] On December 14, 2019, Burrow was awarded the 2019 Heisman Trophy, receiving 1,846 more votes than runner-up Jalen Hurts.[44] It was the largest victory margin in the history of the award, with Burrow receiving the highest-ever share of available points.[45] Burrow's Heisman acceptance speech referred to the rampant poverty and food insecurity affecting his hometown; shortly after his speech, the Athens County food bank was the recipient of $450,000 in donations.[46] Burrow received many other awards during college football award season, including SEC Offensive Player of the Year,[47] AP Player of the Year,[48] Maxwell Award,[49] Walter Camp Award,[50] Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award,[51] Davey O'Brien Award,[52] Lombardi Award,[53] and Manning Award.[54] He was named as a Consensus All-American.[55] In LSU's College Football Playoff semifinal game against fourth-ranked Oklahoma in the 2019 Peach Bowl, Burrow threw for seven touchdowns during the first half of the contest and had a total of 493 passing yards – along with scoring a rushing touchdown – in a 63–28 victory for the Tigers.[56] Burrow's eight total touchdowns were all scored within the first 35 minutes[57] of the 60-minute game, after which the quarterback was taken out for the sake of giving him rest.[58] Analysts have called the performance one of the greatest in college football history.[59][60] In the 2020 National Championship Game against Clemson, Burrow threw for 463 yards with six total touchdowns, five of which were passing, which led LSU to a 42–25 victory and him being named the game's offensive MVP.[61] He finished his 2019 season with 60 passing touchdowns, which broke the single-season FBS record previously set by Colt Brennan's 58 in 2006.[61][n 1] Burrow also set a FBS single-season record with 65 total touchdowns (which would be tied by Bailey Zappe in 2021).[63][62] His 5,671 passing yards is now tied (with Case Keenum in 2009) for fourth-most in an FBS season.[61] His passer rating of 202 for the season was a record at the time.[61][64] Several sportswriters deemed the season to be the greatest ever by a college quarterback.[65][66][67][68] Burrow was one of 58 players invited to the 2020 NFL draft, where he was selected first overall by the Cincinnati Bengals.[71][72] He was the third-consecutive Heisman-winning quarterback to be selected first overall, following Baker Mayfield and Kyler Murray.[73] Burrow signed his four-year rookie contract, worth $36.1 million, on July 31, 2020.[74] Prior to the season, Burrow was considered the favorite to win the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year award.[75][76][77] Burrow was the only rookie quarterback from his draft class to start on opening week.[78] In his debut, Burrow threw for 193 passing yards and an interception, while adding 46 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown in a 16–13 loss against the Los Angeles Chargers.[79] During the next game against the Cleveland Browns, Burrow threw his first career passing touchdown, a 23-yard pass to tight end C. J. Uzomah. Although the Bengals lost the game, 35–30, he attempted 61 passes, completing 37 of them for 316 yards and three touchdowns, which broke the NFL record for most completions by a rookie quarterback in a single game.[80][81] Two weeks later, Burrow earned his first career win by defeating the Jacksonville Jaguars. He also became the first rookie quarterback to throw for 300 or more yards in three straight games.[82] In a Week 7 game against the Browns, Burrow had 406 passing yards, three passing touchdowns, one rushing touchdown, and one interception in a 37–34 loss.[83] He became the first rookie in NFL history with at least 400 passing yards, three passing touchdowns, and a rushing touchdown in a single game,[84] and had completed more passes (221) than any other player in NFL history during their first eight games.[85] In the second half of a Week 11 game against the Washington Football Team, Burrow was hit low while throwing a pass and subsequently tore his ACL and MCL in his left knee, among other damage to his PCL and meniscus.[86][87] He was later placed on injured reserve, ending his rookie season.[88] Undergoing knee surgery in December, Burrow continued to review game film despite being out for the season.[89] On September 6, the Bengals confirmed Burrow had completed his rehab and would be the starter for Week 1.[90] Burrow returned from his injury and helped lead the Bengals to a 2–1 start. In Week 4, Burrow completed 25 of 32 passes for 348 yards and two touchdowns in a 24–21 win over the Jaguars, earning AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[91] Against the Baltimore Ravens in Week 16, Burrow completed 37 of 46 passes, threw for a career-high 525 yards, while also throwing four touchdowns without an interception, for a career-high 143.2 passer rating in the 41–21 win. Burrow's 525 yards were the fourth most passing yards in a game in NFL history, and broke Boomer Esiason's franchise record for most passing yards in a game as a result.[92] The victory in this game was Cincinnati's ninth of the year, clinching the first winning record for the team since the 2015 season, and put the Bengals in first place of the AFC North. Burrow was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week as a result of his performance.[93] The next week against the Kansas City Chiefs, Burrow threw for 446 yards, four touchdowns, and no interceptions in the 34–31 win. The win helped the Bengals clinch the AFC North and a playoff berth for the first time since 2015.[94] Burrow finished the season playing in 16 games with 4,611 passing yards and 34 passing touchdowns, both franchise records.[95] He also led the league in completion percentage (70.4%) and yards per pass attempt (8.9), but also led the league in sacks taken.[96] He was named Comeback Player of the Year by the Associated Press and the PFWA.[97][98] In his playoff debut, Burrow threw for 244 yards and two touchdowns in the 26–19 win against the Las Vegas Raiders in the Wild Card Round, ending the Bengals' playoff win drought that had been active since the 1990 season.[99] During the Divisional Round against the top-seeded Tennessee Titans, Burrow threw for 348 yards and an interception in the 19–16 win, which was the first time in franchise history the Bengals won a playoff game on the road.[100] The victory occurred despite Burrow being sacked nine times, tying Warren Moon in 1993 for the most times sacked in a playoff game and becoming the most-sacked quarterback to win a playoff game.[101] In the AFC Championship Game against the Chiefs, Burrow threw for 250 yards, two touchdowns, an interception, and helped the Bengals overcome a 21–3 deficit to win 27–24 in overtime. The 18-point comeback was tied with the Indianapolis Colts in 2006 for the largest in a conference championship.[102] With the victory, the Bengals reached Super Bowl LVI, their first appearance since Super Bowl XXIII in 1988.[103] In the Super Bowl, Burrow threw for 263 yards and a touchdown, but was sacked 7 times, ultimately losing to the Los Angeles Rams 23–20.[104] Burrow set a playoff record for most times sacked in a single postseason, being sacked 19 times, surpassing the previous record set by Wade Wilson in 1987, with 14.[105] He was ranked 21st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2022.[106] Burrow underwent emergency surgery to remove his appendix on July 26, 2022 as a result of severe appendicitis.[107] In Week 1 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Burrow committed a career-high five turnovers, which included losing a fumble and throwing four interceptions, along with being sacked seven times in the 23–20 overtime loss.[108] Burrow returned to the state of Louisiana in Week 6 against the New Orleans Saints, returning to the Caesars Superdome for the first time since winning the College National Championship. Burrow threw for 300 yards and three touchdowns in the 30–26 victory, two of which to former college teammate Ja'Marr Chase.[109] The following week against the Atlanta Falcons, Burrow finished the game throwing for 481 yards in the 35–17 win.[110] The game was Burrow's fifth game with over 400 passing yards, setting an NFL record for the most 400-yard games in a player's first three seasons. It was also his second game with over 500 yards of offense and four touchdowns, making him the first player to accomplish this multiple times.[111] Burrow was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week as a result of his performance.[112] In Week 13, Burrow threw for 286 yards and two touchdowns, along with 46 rushing yards and a touchdown in a 27–24 win over the Chiefs, earning AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[113] On December 21, Burrow was selected to the Pro Bowl for the first time in his career.[114] In their Week 15 matchup against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Bengals found themselves down 17–3 at halftime. Burrow orchestrated a remarkable comeback in the second half, leading the team to 31 unanswered points and throwing four touchdown passes to four different receivers to lead the team to a 34–23 win.[115] The next week, Burrow threw for 375 yards and three touchdowns in a 22–18 win over the New England Patriots, earning his third AFC Offensive Player of the Week honor of the season.[116] The Bengals' Week 17 game against the Buffalo Bills was declared a no contest due to Bills' safety Damar Hamlin suffering cardiac arrest in-game. This resulted in the Bengals being declared AFC North champions ahead of their final week match against Baltimore, marking the first time the franchise won consecutive division titles.[117] He finished the season ranked fifth in the NFL in both completions (414) and passing yards (4,475), while his franchise record 35 touchdown passes ranked in 2nd.[118][119] Meanwhile, the Bengals finished 12–4 on the season, their best record since 2015, and won their last eight games consecutively.[120] In the 2022–23 NFL playoffs, Burrow led the Bengals to a narrow win over the Ravens in the Wild Card Round and a decisive victory over the Bills in the Divisional Round en route to their second consecutive AFC Championship appearance.[121][122] In a rematch of the previous AFC Championship Game, the Bengals lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Chiefs 23–20.[123] He was ranked 6th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2023, his first ever top ten on the list.[106] Ahead of the season, Burrow suffered a right calf strain during training camp.[124] Bengals head coach Zac Taylor initially stated that Burrow was to be sidelined for \"several weeks\",[125] with no clear timeline in place for his return, but later made a bold announcement that he was \"better than he's ever looked,\" implying a more positive than expected recovery.[126] On September 7, 2023, Burrow signed a five-year, $275 million contract extension, surpassing Justin Herbert to become the highest-paid player in NFL history on an annual basis, with an average annual salary of $55 million.[127] In Week 8, Burrow threw for 283 yards and three touchdowns while completing 87.5% of passes in a 31–17 win over the 49ers, earning AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors.[128] During the first half of the game, Burrow reset his career high with 19 consecutive completed passes.[129] On November 16, Burrow suffered a torn Scapholunate ligament in his right wrist in the first half of the Bengals' Week 11 game against the Ravens.[130] The next day, the Bengals announced that Burrow was to miss the remainder of the season.[131] Burrow was placed on the injured reserve on November 25,[132] and soon thereafter underwent surgery.[133] On November 17, 2023, NFL launched an investigation into whether the Bengals were compliant with the injury report policy as the Bengals had posted then deleted a video on X of Burrow wearing what appeared to be a soft cast on his right hand the day before.[134] On December 9, 2023, NFL concluded their investigation and found the Bengals were compliant with the league's injury report policy.[135] Burrow continued to be involved with team activities and supported his teammates, particularly backup quarterback Jake Browning, from the sidelines for all remaining games of the 2023 season.[136][137][138] Burrow fully recovered from his wrist surgery in time for the 2024 season. He and the Bengals opened the season 0–2 for the third consecutive season following losses to the Patriots and Chiefs.[139] They dropped to 0–3 following a loss to the Washington Commanders, despite 324 yards, three passing touchdowns, and zero turnovers from Burrow.[140] Before their Week 4 matchup against the Carolina Panthers, Burrow delivered an uncharacteristic pregame speech. The speech resonated with the team as the Bengals won their first game of the season, with Burrow passing for 232 yards and two touchdowns, both of which came in the first half.[141] In Week 5, Burrow threw for 353 yards and a career-high five touchdown passes in a 41–38 overtime loss to the Baltimore Ravens.[142] Sitting at 1–4, Burrow led victories over the New York Giants and Cleveland Browns, including a career-long 47-yard touchdown run against the Giants and two second half touchdowns against the Browns.[143][144] In Week 9, Burrow threw for 251 yards, a career-high-tying five touchdown passes and one interception in a 41–24 win over the Las Vegas Raiders.[145] After beating the Raiders, Burrow threw for 428 yards and four touchdowns against the Ravens, followed by a 356-yard, three-touchdown performance against the Chargers. Despite his efforts, the Bengals lost both games, making Burrow the first player to throw for over 300 yards with at least three touchdowns and no interceptions in consecutive games and lose both in regulation.[146] \"Burrow is considered a relatively quiet, occasionally quirky guy. But he's beloved in the LSU locker room, largely because he plays with a competitiveness that borders on fanatical.\" At the NFL combine, Burrow was measured to be 6 ft 3 in and 221 lbs; his hands were measured to be 9 inches.[70] In 2021, Sports Illustrated writer Mike Santagata wrote that Burrow is \"bigger than he looks at about 230 pounds,\" while also noting his athleticism and strength.[148] Through his junior year at LSU, Burrow \"initial run through the [NFL's] scouting machine resulted in such an underwhelming consensus\".[147] Many scouts viewed Burrow as an \"NFL draft afterthought\", and considered him \"a late-round project and potential backup.\"[147] He was seen as having limited physical traits and average production prior to his senior season.[147] SEC analyst Jordan Rodgers opined that Burrow was \"wildly inconsistent, and frankly very poor against good competition\" in 2018.[149] Burrow's 2019 season was cited as helping draw more attention to scouts to reconsider their evaluation of him,[147] and his football IQ, accuracy, pocket mobility, and playmaking outside of the pocket have all been cited as strengths of his game.[150] The Bengals caught attention of these traits in 2019, making Burrow a top pick in the 2020 NFL draft.[148][150] Burrow's football IQ has often been cited by writers, coaches, coordinators, and other players as a critical aspect of Burrow's game. He has been analyzed as being capable of processing opposing defenses quickly.[148] Burrow participated in game plan meetings during his tenure at LSU to discuss the next opponent, where he pitched game plan ideas with LSU passing game coordinator Joe Brady and offensive coordinator Steve Ensminger.[149] The two coaches also trusted Burrow with presnap play calls and Burrow was noted by Sports Illustrated for his tendency to \"often change receiver routes based on defensive formations.\"[149] College GameDay analyst Kirk Herbstreit likened Burrow to a \"co-offensive coordinator\", stating \"That's the NFL model, when you have a quarterback able to invest and communicate at that level. [Burrow] is the cutting edge of that mold. When I watch LSU, it's not just Joe Brady's offense—it's Joe Brady and Joe Burrow's offense.\"[149] As a Bengal, Burrow was noted to have successfully called his own plays during the 2021 Divisional Round game against Tennessee.[151] Burrow plays chess in his spare time, as well as during game preparation. He keeps a chessboard in his locker.[152] Prior to Super Bowl LVI, Burrow played ten matches of online chess.[153] Bengals cornerback Chidobe Awuzie, who plays chess with Burrow, commented \"The fact that he plays chess lets you know that he's able to prioritize certain things and articulate things very fast and have formation recognition.\"[152] Sportswriters have praised Burrow's accuracy, calling his ball placement elite.[148] Bengals offensive coordinator Brian Callahan has stated that Burrow has \"an uncanny ability to place the ball accurately on the move anywhere on the field.\"[150] Charlie Goldsmith of The Cincinnati Enquirer wrote that Burrow possess elite traits in regards to his \"combination of picking up the blitz and his accuracy outside the pocket\".[150] Burrow's pocket management, particularly his movement and footwork within the pocket to help him avoid sacks, has been noted by sportswriters.[148] The Athletic wrote positively of Burrow's \"ability to work a broken pocket,\" stating that Burrow evades defenders and is able to both find space to deliver a throw or run with the ball himself.[154] Intangibles such as dedication, work ethic, and leadership also contributed to the Bengals' decision to pick him first overall.[89] Former New England Patriots running back Kevin Faulk compared Burrow to Tom Brady, noting the former's poise and competitiveness.[149] Once in the NFL, Burrow drew further comparisons to Brady from Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo.[155] Burrow's leadership has also been noted by teammates and opponents alike; veteran Mike Daniels spoke on Burrow being voted a team captain as a rookie, stating that Burrow earned the respect of his veteran teammates before even playing.[156] Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes has stated \"Not only is he a great football player, I think he's a great leader. He has that special knack where he can lead anybody.\"[155] Mahomes and Baltimore Ravens linebacker Patrick Queen have also noted Burrow's \"swag\" or \"swagger\".[155][157] Indeed, Burrow has been noted by writers for his \"cool\" demeanor both on and off the field.[158][159] ProFootballTalk writer Peter King wrote that \"Burrow's steely mentality and his right arm are putting him on the path to greatness. I wouldn't bet against him.\"[160] Burrow's attitude has been attributed as a factor in his ability to remain calm under pressure in-game, earning him the \"Joe Cool\" and \"Joe Brrr\" nicknames.[161][162][163] Burrow spent one summer during college interning at Goldman Sachs.[25] After signing his rookie contract with the Bengals, Burrow stated that he planned to save all of his contract money and instead live through income received from endorsements.[172] Burrow is a fan of the Super Smash Bros. video game series.[173] In a 2023 interview, Burrow stated that he usually plays Super Smash Bros. Ultimate on flights to road games with his teammates, and that he frequently plays as Ness from Earthbound.[174] Burrow is an avid fan of Kid Cudi, often listening to his music prior to Bengals games.[175] In February 2022, Burrow appeared on-stage with Cudi during a Super Bowl afterparty.[176] Later in the year, Cudi included a bonus track named after Burrow on his Entergalactic album.[177] In January 2023, Burrow was among a coalition of about a dozen athletes, including Blake Griffin and Kevin Gausman, who purchased a 104-acre north Iowa farm with plans to further acquire a diverse set of agricultural assets.[178] In the wake of the Roe v. Wade being overturned in June 2022, Burrow spoke out on Instagram in favor of abortion rights in the United States.[179] Following the Uvalde elementary school shooting, Burrow expressed his support for stricter gun control reforms during a press conference.[180]",

                "content": "Joseph Lee Burrow (born December 10, 1996) is an American quarterback who plays for the NFL's Cincinnati Bengals. He started his college career as a backup quarterback for the Ohio State Buckeyes, before transferring to Louisiana State University (LSU). During his senior year at LSU, he passed for over 5,600 yards and 60 touchdowns, and was awarded the Heisman Trophy. He also led the Tigers to an undefeated season and College Football National Championship. After college, he was drafted first overall by the Bengals in 2020. He led the Bengals to an appearance in Super Bowl LVI. Joseph Lee Burrow was born in Ames, Iowa on December 10, 1996,[1][2][3] the son of Robin and Jim Burrow. Jim is a former football player and coach whose career lasted over 40 years.[4] Burrow was born in Ames when his father was on the staff for the Iowa State Cyclones.[5] Joe's family is notably involved in sports. According to a 2019 Sports Illustrated story, \"the Burrow athletic lineage dates back nearly a century.\"[6] From 2011–2014, Burrow attended Athens High School in The Plains, Ohio, leading the school to three straight playoff appearances and the school's first seven playoff victories in school history.[7] During his high school career, he passed for 11,416 yards and 157 touchdowns, while also rushing for 2,067 yards with 27 rushing touchdowns.[8] He was awarded the state's Mr. Football Award and Gatorade Player of the Year award as a senior in 2014. He and his Bulldog teammates went 14–1 that season. During high school, Burrow also played basketball at a high level and was named first-team all-state at point guard his senior year.[7] Burrow was rated as a four-star football recruit, and was the eighth-highest ranked dual-threat quarterback in the class of 2015 according to the 247SportsmComposite.[9] On May 27, 2014, he committed to Ohio State University to play football for the Buckeyes.[10][11] Joe Burrow played college football at Ohio State University for the Buckeyes. He was a redshirt freshman in 2015, meaning he did not play his first year of college. He was then a backup to J. T. Barrett for the next two years. During that time, he played in 10 games, completing 29-of-39 pass attempts for 287 yards and two touchdowns.[12] Dwayne Haskins was then named the starting quarterback for the Buckeyes. Because of this, Burrow decided to transfer to Louisiana State University (LSU) to play for the Tigers.[13][14] Burrow graduated from Ohio State in three years with a degree in consumer and family financial services, and would be immediately eligible as a graduate transfer.[15] In his first year as a Tiger, in 2018, Burrow was named the starter as a redshirt junior. He earned 2 SEC Player of the Week honors during the season.[16] The Tigers finished the season with a 10–3 record. Burrow has 2,894 passing yards and 16 passing touchdowns to 5 interceptions. While rushing the football, Burrow had 399 yards and 7 touchdowns. The following season, Burrow had what many sportswriters and football experts described as the best season by a college quarterback.[17][18][19][20] In a blowout win against Texas A&M, Burrow set the single-season Southeastern Conference (SEC) record in passing yards and tied the single-season record for passing touchdowns.[21] The following week, Burrow led the Tigers to a 37–10 win in the SEC Championship Game against the Georgia Bulldogs, securing the Tigers' place in the College Football Playoff.[22] He was named the game's Most Valuable Player (MVP) and during the win, Burrow set the single-season SEC record for passing touchdowns.[22] Later, on December 14, 2019, Burrow was awarded the 2019 Heisman Trophy, winning the award by a record-margin of votes.[23] In the playoff semifinal game at the 2019 Peach Bowl, Burrow led the Tigers to a 63–28 win over the fourth-ranked Oklahoma Sooners.[24] In the win, Burrow completed 29-of-39 pass attempts for 493 passing yards and seven passing touchdowns, to go along with five rushes for 22 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown.[24] Burrow's eight total touchdowns were an FBS bowl game record and SEC single game record, and were recorded in just over one half of play before Burrow was rested.[25] Analysts have called Burrow's performance one of the greatest in college football history.[26][27] In the 2020 College Football Playoff National Championship Game against Clemson, Burrow threw for 463 yards and five passing touchdowns. Burrow also ran for a touchdown in the game and was named the game's offensive MVP, as he led LSU to a 42–25 victory.[28] With the win, LSU finished with an undefeated 15–0 season. He finished his 2019 season with 60 passing touchdowns, which set the single-season NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) record.[28] Burrow's record has since been passed by Bailey Zappe of Western Kentucky, who threw for 62 touchdowns in 2021.[29] Burrow also set a new FBS single-season record in combined passing and rushing touchdowns, with 65.[30] Zappe tied this record in 2021.[29] Burrow also finished the year with 5,671 passing yards, which is tied for fourth all-time in an FBS season.[28] His passer rating of 202 for the season was also a record until it was passed by Mac Jones in 2020.[28][31] After his first year at LSU, Burrow was not expected to be a first-round NFL Draft pick.[32] However, after his senior season, Burrow became the heavy favorite to be picked first overall.[33] A Draft Network analysis of Burrow's skill set before the draft complimented Burrow for his \"elite football intelligence,\" but stated Burrow doesn't have \"elite arm strength and throwing power.\" Their final evaluation stated: Coming off the greatest season in SEC quarterback history, Joe Burrow features a high-level skill set with the makeup of being a dynamic franchise quarterback. His blend of accuracy, ability to handle pressure, mechanics and mental processing skills are all bluechip traits that make him NFL ready in Year One. Burrow may lack elite throwing power, but it's a minor knock in an overall impressive package.[3] The Cincinnati Bengals would indeed draft Burrow first overall in the 2020 NFL Draft.[32] Burrow signed his four-year rookie contract, worth $36.1 million, on July 31, 2020.[34] During the off-season and the preseason, Burrow was thought to be the favorite to win the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year award.[35][36][37] Burrow was the only rookie quarterback from his draft class to start in the first week of the 2020 season.[38] In his first game, Burrow threw for 193 passing yards and an interception, and rushed for 46 yards and a touchdown in a 16–13 loss against the Los Angeles Chargers.[39] In their next game, the Bengals went against the Cleveland Browns. In the game, Burrow threw his first career passing touchdown, a 23-yard pass to tight end C. J. Uzomah. The Bengals lost the game 35–30, but Burrow set an NFL rookie record for pass completions, with 37.[40][41] In Week 4 of the season, Burrow earned his first career win as he led the Bengals over the Jacksonville Jaguars. It was also his third straight game throwing for 300 or more passing yards, making him the first rookie quarterback to do so.[42] In the second half of a Week 11 game against the Washington Football Team, Burrow was hit while throwing a pass. This caused tears to his ACL and MCL in his left knee, among other damage to his PCL and meniscus.[43][44] He was later placed on injured reserve, ending his rookie season.[45] Even while injured, Burrow was noted to continue preparing for games by watching game film.[46] He finished his rookie season with a 2–7–1 record as a starter, 2,688 passing yards, and 13 passing touchdowns to 5 interceptions.[47] He also rushed for 142 yards and 3 touchdowns during the season. In Week 4, Burrow completed 25-of-32 passes for 348 yards and two touchdowns in a 24–21 win over the Jaguars.

In 2019, Burrow impressed the Bengals with his competitiveness, his football IQ, his accuracy, his ability to move in the pocket and his ability to make plays outside of the pocket. For every quality the coaching staff saw on Burrow's college tape, there's a throw from the last month that highlights it.[50] The Bengals finished the regular season with a 10–7 record.

However, Burrow helped the Bengals turn it around as the team won the AFC North again and finished with a 12–4 record.[57] This was the first time the Bengals won their division two years in a row.[58] After throwing for 481 yards and 3 touchdowns against the Atlanta Falcons in Week 7, he was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[59] Burrow was also picked for the Pro Bowl.[60] He finished the season passing for 4,475 yards and 35 touchdowns, while also completing 68.3% of his throws.[61] His 35 touchdowns set a new Bengals team record.[62] In the playoffs, Burrow helped the Bengals win over the Ravens and the Buffalo Bills.[63][64] However, the Bengals lost in the AFC Championship game to the Chiefs, 20–23.[65] After signing his rookie contract with the Bengals, Burrow stated that he planned to save all of his contract money and instead live through income received from endorsements.[69] Burrow has been reported to be dating Olivia Holzmacher, who also went to Ohio State.[46][70]",

(Source: Jason Mowry/Getty Images) His exceptional performance that season was pivotal in his selection as the first overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft by the Cincinnati Bengals. Since joining the NFL, Burrow has been recognized for his leadership on and off the field. Despite suffering a major injury in his rookie year (an ACL tear in 2020), he made a quick recovery and helped the Bengals reach Super Bowl LVI in 2022, a milestone the franchise hadn’t achieved in over 30 years. Known for his maturity, decision-making skills, passing accuracy, and on-field leadership, Burrow is considered one of the most promising and talented quarterbacks in the National Football League. Joe Burrow has been in a long-term relationship with Olivia Holzmacher, whom he began dating in 2015 while they were both attending Ohio State University, according to sources like Sports Illustrated and Today.

They made their relationship public in 2017 through Instagram. Olivia is not only a football fan but also a skilled professional. She works as a Senior Process Specialist and Analyst at Kroger, focusing on data analytics related to e-commerce services. Although they prefer to keep their private life under wraps, Holzmacher has been seen cheering on Burrow at several Bengals games and has shared moments from their life together on social media, as well as attending various events. In 2023, rumors of a potential engagement surfaced, but the couple has not publicly confirmed such a development. It would not be a surprise if they soon announced their romantic status, so we’ll have to wait to find out.

                "content": "Peter Morgan Alonso (born December 7, 1994), nicknamed \"Polar Bear\", is an American professional baseball first baseman who is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Mets. He made his MLB debut in 2019. Alonso played college baseball for the Florida Gators before the Mets selected him in the 2016 MLB draft. He made his MLB debut on Opening Day in 2019 and won the National League's Rookie of the Year award that year, setting a major league record for rookies with 53 home runs. Alonso is a four-time MLB All-Star that led the league in homers in 2019 and in RBI in 2022. He has also won the MLB Home Run Derby twice, in 2019 and 2021. Peter Morgan Alonso was born on December 7, 1994, in Tampa, Florida. His father, Peter Matthew Alonso, is the son of Spanish refugees who fled Barcelona during the Spanish Civil War and moved to Queens, a borough of New York City, but later settled in Lancaster, Ohio. His mother, Michelle Lynn Alonso (née Morgan), played college softball at Ohio Wesleyan University.[1][2] Alonso attended Jesuit High School in Tampa for his first two years of high school, and transferred to Henry B. Plant High School in Tampa to finish high school.[3][4] He played lacrosse and football as a freshman before deciding to focus solely on baseball.[5] For the baseball team, he was a third baseman.[6] Alonso enrolled at the University of Florida, where he played college baseball for the Florida Gators as a first baseman. He was named All-Southeastern Conference in his freshman year.[4] In 2014, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Madison Mallards of the Northwoods League,[7] and he was inducted into their Hall of Fame in 2024.[8][9] In the summer of 2015, he played for the Bourne Braves of the Cape Cod Baseball League.[10] In 2016, his junior year, he hit .374/.469/.659 with 14 home runs and 60 RBIs in 58 games.[11] He competed for Florida in the 2015 and 2016 College World Series.[12] The New York Mets selected Alonso in the second round, with the 64th pick overall, of the 2016 Major League Baseball draft.[6][13] He signed with the Mets for a $909,200 signing bonus,[14] and made his professional debut in 2016 with the Brooklyn Cyclones of the Class A-Short Season New York-Penn League. He posted a .322 batting average with five home runs and 21 RBIs in thirty games and was chosen to participate in the league's all-star game.[15] He began the 2017 season with the St. Lucie Mets of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League, and after batting .286 with 16 home runs and 58 RBIs in 82 games, was promoted to the Binghamton Rumble Ponies of the Class AA Eastern League in August,[16] where he batted .311 with two home runs and five RBIs in 11 games.[17] MLB.com ranked Alonso as New York's fourth-best prospect going into the 2018 season.[18] He began the 2018 season in Binghamton,[19] and received a midseason promotion to the Las Vegas 51s of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League. He represented the Mets in the 2018 All-Star Futures Game.[20] In 132 games between Binghamton and Las Vegas, he slashed .285/.395/.579 with 36 home runs and 119 RBIs.[21] He won the Joe Bauman Home Run Award.[22] That season, Alonso was the final batter in Cashman Field history, as he hit a walk-off home run in the bottom of the 9th inning during the last baseball game played at the facility.[23] Alonso made the Mets Opening Day roster in 2019 as the starting first baseman.[24] He was in the team's starting lineup on Opening Day on March 28, and recorded his first major league hit against Washington Nationals pitcher Justin Miller in the eighth inning.[25] First publicized on March 30, third-base coach Gary DiSarcina gave Alonso the endearing nickname \"Polar Bear\" for his power.[26] He hit his first major league home run on April 1 off of Drew Steckenrider of the Miami Marlins.[27] On April 9, Alonso had his first career multi-home run game against the Minnesota Twins.[28] Alonso became the first player in MLB history since 1900 with 11 extra-base hits in his first 10 career games. No other player ever had more than nine.[29] In April, Alonso batted .292 with nine home runs, eight doubles, one triple and 26 RBIs in his first games in the big leagues. He won the National League Rookie of the Month Award for April.[30] Alonso's nine home runs led all MLB rookies and are tied for the most by a Mets player before May 1 with Neil Walker (2016), John Buck (2013), Carlos Delgado (2006) and Dave Kingman (1976).[31] On June 22, Alonso hit his 26th home run, breaking the National League record for most home runs by a rookie before the All-Star break, passing Cody Bellinger. The next day, with his 27th home run, he broke the Mets rookie home run record, previously set by Darryl Strawberry in 1983.[32][33] Alonso was selected as a reserve to the 2019 All-Star Game.[34] He also won the National League Rookie of the Month Award for the month of June.[35] On July 7, Alonso became the second player in Mets history to hit the most home runs (30) before the All-Star break, after Dave Kingman (1976).[36] On July 8, Alonso won the 2019 MLB Home Run Derby, defeating Toronto Blue Jays third baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. 23–22 in the final round, becoming only the second rookie, after Aaron Judge, to win the Derby outright. On the way to the final round, Alonso also beat Carlos Santana and Ronald Acuña Jr., hitting 57 total home runs during the entire Derby.[37] On August 15, Alonso hit his 39th home run, tying Bellinger for the most home runs by a rookie in National League history. Alonso finished the game with a career-high five hits and six RBIs.[38] He broke Bellinger's record on August 18 with his 40th home run in an 11–5 win against the Kansas City Royals.[39] On August 27, Alonso hit his 42nd home run to become the Mets all-time single-season home run leader, surpassing Carlos Beltrán and Todd Hundley. He is the first rookie to set his franchise's single-season home run record since Johnny Rizzo did it for the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1938.[40] On September 27, Alonso hit his 52nd home run of the season, tying Aaron Judge for the most home runs by a rookie in MLB history.[41] He hit his 53rd the next day to break Judge's record.[42] His 53 home runs led all of Major League Baseball for the 2019 season. On November 11, Alonso was awarded the National League Rookie of the Year, receiving 29 of 30 first-place votes.[43][44] On December 10, Alonso was named to the first team of the inaugural All-MLB Team.[45] In the 2020 season shortened by COVID-19, Alonso played in 57 of the 60 games and batted .231/.326/.490 with 16 home runs and 35 RBIs.[46] On September 3, 2020, Alonso hit his first career walk-off home run.[47] Alonso's sophomore season was a step back from his breakout rookie year; Danny Abriano of Yahoo Sports called it \"a season to forget.\"[48] However, he had the highest maximum exit velocity of all major league hitters, at 118.4 miles per hour (190.5 km/h).[49] Alonso's sophomore slump coupled with a second consecutive breakout season from Dominic Smith led some talent evaluators to favor the latter as the team's starting first baseman heading into the 2021 season.[50] On July 12, Alonso won his second straight Home Run Derby after defeating Baltimore Orioles first baseman Trey Mancini 23–22 in the final round.[51] He became the third player ever to win back-to-back Home Run Derbys, as well as the fourth player to win two Home Run Derbys (after Ken Griffey Jr., Prince Fielder, and Yoenis Céspedes). Newsday Mets beat writer Tim Healey noted Alonso has earned $2 million from winning the Home Run Derby twice while making $1.47 million from 2019–2021 in base salary while playing for the Mets.[52] On September 7, Alonso hit his 100th career home run, off of Miami Marlins pitcher Edward Cabrera. He accomplished the feat in 347 games, becoming the second-fastest player to reach 100 career home runs behind Ryan Howard, who did it in 325 games.[53] Alonso played in 152 games for the Mets in 2021, batting .262/.344/.519 with 37 home runs and 94 RBIs. On March 22, 2022, Alonso signed a $7.4 million contract with the Mets, avoiding salary arbitration.[54] He hit his first career grand slam on April 9 against the Washington Nationals, off of pitcher Joan Adon.[55] On July 10, Alonso was named to the 2022 MLB All-Star Game, the second selection of his career,[56] He participated in the Home Run Derby, making it to the semifinals.[57] In a September 25 game against the Oakland Athletics, Alonso drove in five runs, setting a new Mets' single-season RBI record with 125.[58] He broke the record on a 451-foot (137 m) two-run home run in the fourth inning off of pitcher Norge Ruiz. The Mets previous RBI record was held by Mike Piazza (1999) and David Wright (2008).[59] On September 27 against the Miami Marlins, Alonso hit his 40th home run of the season, becoming the first Mets player to accomplish the feat twice.[60] In 2022, Alonso batted .271/.352/.518 with 40 home runs and 131 RBIs, breaking the franchise record and tying Aaron Judge for the most RBI in the major leagues.[61] Alonso and the Mets agreed to a $14.5 million salary for the 2023 season during the arbitration period.[62] On April 7, during a game against the Miami Marlins, Alonso hit his 150th career home run, passing Carlos Beltrán for sixth place on the Mets all-time home run list. He also became the second fastest player to 150 home runs (in 538 games) since Ryan Howard (495 games).[63] On June 7, Alonso was placed on the injured list when he suffered a bone bruise and left wrist sprain after being hit by a pitch.[64] He was expected to miss three to four weeks due to the injury, but recovered in just eleven days and was activated from the injured list on June 18.[65] On September 3, during a game against the Seattle Mariners, Alonso homered twice and drove in four runs, reaching 40-plus home runs and 100 RBIs for the second consecutive season. Alonso's two-run shot made him the fifth player in Major League history with at least three 40-home run seasons in his first five seasons of their career, joining Ralph Kiner (four seasons), Eddie Mathews, Ryan Howard, and Albert Pujols (each with 3 seasons).[66] On September 27, Alonso hit his 46th home run of the season in an 11–2 win over the Miami Marlins. His 192nd career homer made him tie Howard Johnson for 4th place on the Mets all-time home run list.[67][68] Alonso finished the 2023 season batting .217/.318/.504 with 46 home runs and 118 RBI.[69] The Mets and Alonso agreed on a one-year, $20.5 million contract to avoid salary arbitration on January 11, 2024.[70] On April 4, during a game against the Detroit Tigers, Alonso recorded his 500th career RBI on a game-tying home run off of pitcher Alex Faedo, becoming the 10th and fastest player in Mets history to achieve the milestone.[71][72] He then won NL Player of the Week honors on April 15.[73] On April 27 against the St. Louis Cardinals, Alonso hit his 200th career home run, off of pitcher Sonny Gray. He became the fourth-fastest player in MLB history to hit 200 home runs and the 4th Met to hit 200 career home runs.[74][75] On May 13, it was reported online that the Mets made an attempt to extend Alonso the previous season but they were unsuccessful, as he turned down a seven-year, $158 million contract extension from the team.[76] Alonso hit his 220th career home run on August 27 against the Arizona Diamondbacks, tying Mike Piazza for 3rd-place on the Mets all-time home run list.[77] Two days later, he would hit his 221st career homer, passing Piazza.[78][79] In 2024, Alonso appeared in 162 games for the Mets, making him the second player in Mets history to appear in every game in a single-season. He finished the season batting .240/.329/.459 with 34 home runs and 88 RBI.[80] On October 3, in Game 3 the 2024 National League Wild Card Series against the Milwaukee Brewers, with the Mets down 2–0 in the top of the 9th inning, Alonso hit a go-ahead, three-run home run to give the Mets a 3–2 lead. They would then go on to win 4–2 and eliminate the Brewers from the playoffs.[81] With that home run, Alonso became the first major league player in history to hit a go-ahead homer while trailing in the ninth inning or later of a winner-take-all postseason game.[82] In the 2024 MLB postseason, Alonso played in 13 games for the Mets, batting .273/.431/.568 with 4 home runs and 10 RBI.[83] After the 2024 season, Alonso's contract with the Mets expired and became a free agent for the first time in his career.[84] The Mets offered him a qualifying offer on November 2, which he declined on November 19.[85] On August 17, 2022, Alonso announced that he would also join the United States national baseball team in the 2023 World Baseball Classic.[86] Alonso went 2-for-14 across five games, most notably starting an eighth inning rally with a base hit against Venezuela in the quarterfinals, and later hitting an RBI single against Cuba in the semifinals.[87][88] Alonso first got his \"Polar Bear\" nickname when he was a top prospect. He made such a big impression during spring training in 2019 that Mets third baseman Todd Frazier, who was known for giving players nicknames, is the one who first coined it. Frazier said to Alonso, \"You look like a big, damn polar bear.\" \"And then it just kind of stuck,\" Alonso said during his rookie season.[89][90] Alonso married Haley Walsh on November 12, 2021, at Sacred Heart Catholic Church in downtown Tampa. She is originally from Boston; they met in the summer of 2015 while he was playing in the Cape Cod collegiate summer league. They carried on a long-distance relationship while he continued at the University of Florida and she attended Michigan State University. They were engaged in November 2018.[91][92] In 2020, the couple formed The Alonso Foundation, a charitable organization that supports youth, veteran, and animal causes.[93] On March 13, 2022, Alonso was involved in a car accident in Tampa, Florida, which he described as a \"really close experience to death.\" A driver ran a red light and struck Alonso's vehicle, which flipped over three times. Neither Alonso nor anyone else involved in the incident was injured.[94] An avid outdoorsman, he enjoys hunting and fishing. He was also featured in a season 9 episode of MeatEater in which he hunted mule deer in Colorado with Steven Rinella.[95]",

                "title": "Pete Alonso learning Spanish for Mets teammates",
                "content": "Anthony DiComo PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. -- A month after the Mets drafted him, in his debut for what was then Class A Short-Season Brooklyn, Pete Alonso experienced a bit of Minor League culture shock. Starting pitcher Harol González, a 21-year-old Spanish-speaking prospect, was in a jam. As the infield gathered around for a mound visit, Spanish-speaking catcher Ali Sánchez and English-speaking pitching coach Bill Bryk began trying to communicate with González. No one could follow the conversation. In what would become a regular occurrence in his life as a big leaguer, Alonso did his best to translate -- relatively unsuccessfully that day, but far more adequately in the months and years to come. Over his career, Alonso, who homered in the Mets' 8-4 win over the Marlins on Wednesday, has endeavored to achieve a level of fluency in Spanish, seeing it not only as an on-field skill but as a way to bond with teammates. He uses it regularly on first base and in the clubhouse, in situations both serious and casual. As Alonso puts it, “I don’t know if I can talk my way out of an arrest, but I’m pretty decent.” “I appreciate that he’s trying to find a way to interact with us,” said bilingual teammate Francisco Lindor. Alonso’s education began in childhood, during visits with his grandfather and great-aunt who emigrated from Spain in the 1930s. As they grew elderly, those two began losing the English skills they had picked up after coming to America, which forced Alonso to use more of his primitive Spanish to communicate with them. By the fourth grade, Alonso was learning formally at his Florida school, where students were not given the choice to learn French, Italian or Latin. Spanish, for its prominence in the general population, was a requirement. But it was not until Alonso’s years in the Minor Leagues that he “really started to get pretty decent.” Immersed in a clubhouse with players from the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and beyond, Alonso saw Spanish as a tool to learn about his teammates. Prospects from those countries typically take classes in English, but their American counterparts are not expected to reciprocate. As a result, cliques tend to form in the lower Minors. “The majority of these guys don’t know Spanish,” Alonso said, gesturing from one end of the room to the other, “and the majority of these guys don’t know English. How do you make that work?” Practice helps. Alonso hasn’t tried any language learning software in his free time, but his daily work environment features plenty of conversation partners -- more than one-third of those on the Mets’ spring roster are fluent in Spanish. He has used it to conduct interviews with Latino media outlets. On a recent vacation to Italy, Alonso tried communicating with both the Italian he learned in college as well as some Spanish, which is more widely understood than English in parts of that country. “When someone is trying to learn another language, it starts selfishly -- like you want to learn the other language, you want to expand your vocabulary,” Lindor said. “But it turns into a form of trying to bond with your teammates, trying to understand them.\" Other North American players have endeavored to learn Spanish over the years -- Cincinnati’s Joey Votto is one prominent example -- but such cases are relatively few and far between. Lindor could recall only one other Minor League teammate who took the time to do it with any level of thoroughness. Alonso is the exception. Even when talking to truly bilingual teammates such as Lindor, he doesn’t shy away from Spanish, despite the fact that he still struggles with complex sentences and conjugation. He credits some of the friendships he’s made in pro ball to his ability to speak the language or even just to his willingness to try. Younger players see it and appreciate the effort. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. “If you can help a few guys out here and there, I think it’s beneficial,” Alonso said. “Not only is it a language barrier, but it’s a huge cultural change where guys have to adjust to living in the United States. I think [speaking their language] helps a lot.” These days, however, English and Spanish are no longer the only tongues one can hear in the clubhouse. The Mets have a new player in Kodai Senga, who isn’t fluent in either. Challenge accepted, says Alonso: “Now, I’ve got to brush up on my Japanese.\"",

                "title": "Dave Parker - Wikipedia",
                "content": "David Gene Parker (born June 9, 1951), nicknamed \"the Cobra\",[1] is an American former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a right fielder from 1973 to 1991. A seven-time All-Star, Parker won two National League batting titles and was the 1978 National League Most Valuable Player. He was a member of two World Series championship teams, winning with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1979 and the Oakland Athletics in 1989. Parker was the second professional athlete to earn an average of $1 million per year, having signed a five-year, $5 million contract in January 1979. Parker's career achievements include 2,712 hits, 339 home runs, 1,493 runs batted in and a lifetime batting average of .290. Parker was also known as a solid defensive outfielder during the first half of his career with a powerful arm, winning three straight Gold Gloves during his prime. From 1975 to 1979, he threw out 72 runners, including 26 in 1977. In 2025, Parker will be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.[2] Parker grew up in Cincinnati near Crosley Field, where he learned to play baseball on the stadium's parking lots. His father, Dick Parker, was a shipping clerk in a foundry.[3] Dave Parker attended Courter Tech High School. He has said his favorite sport was football, and he starred at tailback but injured a knee in a game during his senior year and gave up the game. Also a baseball star, one of his fondest memories is playing at Western Hills High School (alma mater of Pete Rose), where he hit a home run that landed on the roof of a Frisch's restaurant.[4] In 1973, as a member of the Pirates Triple–A minor league affiliate, the Charleston Charlies, legend has it that Parker hit a home run that landed on a coal car on a passing train and the ball was later picked up in Columbus, Ohio.[5] However, in a 1975 interview, Parker stated, \"When I played for Charleston I always had the ambition to hit a home run onto a moving train. I really used to shoot for that. I hit a few on the tracks, but never as a train was going by.\"[6] He began his major league career on July 12, 1973, with the Pittsburgh Pirates, for whom he played from 1973 to 1983. His first full season came in 1975, when he led the National League in slugging percentage (.541) and finished third in NL MVP voting. In 1977, he was National League batting champion, a feat he repeated in 1978 when he was named the National League MVP. This was in spite of a collision at home plate with John Stearns during a game against the Mets on June 30, 1978, in which Parker fractured his jaw and cheekbone; he wore a specially constructed facemask in order to minimize his time away from the lineup.[7] The Pirates rewarded him with baseball's first million-dollar-per-year contract.[8][9] The following year, he was an instrumental part of the Pirates' World Series championship team.[10] During a game in 1979, a powerful hit he made to right field was very difficult to throw into the infield, because he had \"knocked the cover off the ball.\" One of the seams on the ball ruptured, making nearly half of the cover come loose.[11] Pirate fans angered by his million-dollar contract threw \"nuts and bolts and bullets and batteries\" at him, as pitcher Kent Tekulve stated. A typo in a news story made it appear they threw car batteries.[12] In 1981 at a point in his career when it looked as if he would one day rank among the game's all-time greats, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time.[13] The authors, noting that Parker had succeeded Roberto Clemente at the position, wrote, \"Someone must have a fondness for right field in Pittsburgh.\" Parker took after his Pirates teammate Willie Stargell in warming up in the on-deck circle with a sledgehammer (when most batters would use a simple lead-weighted bat).[14] In the early 1980s, however, Parker's hitting suffered due to injuries, weight problems and his increasing cocaine use.[15] He became one of the central figures in a drug scandal that spread through the major leagues. At the end of the 1983 season, Parker became a free agent and signed with the Cincinnati Reds. In Cincinnati, his hometown, he returned to the form that made him an All-Star in Pittsburgh.[12] In 1985, he enjoyed his best season since he won the 1978 MVP with a .312 batting average and 34 home runs; he also led the National League with 125 RBIs, 42 doubles, 80 extra-base hits and 350 total bases. Parker finished second in 1985 MVP voting to Willie McGee. Parker was also the winner of the league's first-ever Home Run Derby in 1985. Following the season, Parker was among several players who testified against a dealer in the Pittsburgh drug trials. Named as \"regular users\", Parker and six other players were suspended for the following season. The sentences were commuted, however, in exchange for donating ten percent of their base salaries to drug-related community service, submitting to random drug testing, and contributing 100 hours of drug-related community service.[16][17] After the 1987 season, Cincinnati traded Parker to the Oakland Athletics for José Rijo and Tim Birtsas. In Oakland, Parker was able to extend his career by spending most of his time as a designated hitter. Although injuries and age caught up to him to a degree – he hit just .257 with 12 homers in 377 at-bats in 1988 and .264 with 22 homers in 553 at-bats in 1989 – his veteran leadership was a significant factor in the A's consecutive World Series appearances which included another World Series title for Parker 1989, exactly 10 years after his first one with the Pirates in '79. Parker signed with the Milwaukee Brewers for the 1990 season and had a solid year as the Brewers' DH with a .289 average and 21 home runs in 610 at-bats. He was even selected as a reserve for the 1990 All-Star Game. Milwaukee opted for youth however, at the end of the year and traded the aging Parker to the Angels for Dante Bichette. Parker's last season was 1991. He played for the California Angels until late in the season before being released. The Toronto Blue Jays then signed him as insurance for the pennant race, and Parker hit .333 in limited action. Since he was acquired too late in the season, he did not qualify for inclusion on the post-season roster and was unable to play in the American League Championship Series against the Minnesota Twins, which the Blue Jays lost in five games. Parker retired at end of the season. Source:[1][2] In 30 postseason games, Parker batted .234 (26-for-111) with 11 runs, 5 doubles, 3 home runs, 11 RBI and 7 walks. Parker has served as a first-base coach for the Anaheim Angels, a batting coach for the St. Louis Cardinals in 1998, and a special hitting instructor for Pittsburgh. He owned several Popeyes Chicken franchises in Cincinnati[18] until selling his interest in them in 2012 after 25 years.[19] Parker never got more than 24% of votes on Baseball Hall of Fame ballots, and his 15-year Baseball Writers' Association of America eligibility was exhausted on the 2011 ballot. Supporters of Parker's candidacy argue that his involvement with the Pittsburgh drug trials has contributed to his not being voted into the Hall of Fame, which may have also harmed the candidacies of Keith Hernandez (who never received more than 10.8% and fell off the writers' ballot on his ninth try) and Tim Raines (debuted at 24.3%, but was elected on his tenth year on the ballot), serving as a precursor to those listed on the Mitchell Report not being voted into the Hall of Fame due to steroid abuse.[20][21] Parker appeared on the Classic Baseball Era Committee's 2025 ballot and was elected with 87.5% of the vote on December 8, 2024. He will be formally inducted on July 27, 2025.[22][2] Parker has had both of his knees replaced due to injuries from his playing career.[23] In 2013, he confirmed to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.[24] He is involved in raising money to find a cure for Parkinson's disease through the Dave Parker 39 Foundation.[25] Parker has six children. He currently resides in Loveland, Ohio, near Cincinnati, with his wife, Kellye.[4][19] Parker was elected to the Reds Hall of Fame Class of 2014, which also included fellow Cincinnati natives Ron Oester and Ken Griffey Jr.[26] In 2012, he was inducted into the Cincinnati Public Schools Athletic Hall of Fame.[4] On September 3, 2022, he was inducted into the Pittsburgh Pirates Hall of Fame as part of its inaugural class.",

                "content": "Cade York (born January 27, 2001) is an American professional football placekicker for the Cincinnati Bengals of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the LSU Tigers, winning the 2019 national championship prior to being selected by the Cleveland Browns in the fourth round of the 2022 NFL draft. York attended Prosper High School in Texas, where he played both soccer and football, and was one of the top kicking prospects in the nation in the latter sport.[1] He committed to playing college football at LSU, and had set an Under Armour All-America Game record for longest field goal, hitting a 59-yard field goal, besting his career long in high school of 47 yards.[2][3][4] York was named the Tigers' starting kicker before the start of the 2019 season. He got off to a shaky start in the season, missing an extra point against Northwestern State and field goals against Utah State and Florida, but rebounded to make the Southeastern Conference (SEC) All-Freshman team, as well as second-team All-SEC as the Tigers won the 2020 College Football Playoff.[5] York finished his sophomore season perfect on extra points (36-for-36), hit 85.7% of his field goal attempts (18-for-21), and was a semi-finalist for the Lou Groza Award, given to the top placekicker in college football.[6] In the December 12 game against Florida, York hit his career-long field goal of 57 yards with 27 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter to put LSU ahead 37–34, leading to the Tigers' upset of the then-No. 6 ranked team in the country.[7][8] York was named a first-team All-SEC by the coaches and second-team All-SEC by the Associated Press (AP) at the end of the season. He was also named a second-team All-American by the AP and the Football Writers Association of America.[9] York was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 124th overall pick in the fourth round of the 2022 NFL draft.[12] He began his career converting all four field goal attempts and both extra point attempts against the Carolina Panthers, including a game-winning 58 yard field goal in the 26–24 win.[13] York's performance in his first professional game led to American Football Conference Special Teams Player of the Week honors.[14] York finished his rookie season converting 35 of 37 extra-point attempts and 24 of 32 field goal attempts.[15] After struggling in the 2023 preseason and the Browns acquiring Dustin Hopkins from the Los Angeles Chargers via trade, York was waived on August 29, 2023.[16][17] On August 31, 2023, York was signed to the practice squad of the Tennessee Titans.[18] On November 3, 2023, York was signed by the New York Giants off the Titans practice squad.[19] He was waived on November 22 and re-signed to the practice squad two days later.[20][21] After suffering a quad injury in practice, the Giants placed him on injured reserve on December 23.[22] He was not signed to a reserve/future contract and thus became a free agent at the end of the season.[23] On March 23, 2024, York signed a contract to return to the Cleveland Browns.[24] On August 22, 2024, York was traded to the Washington Commanders for a conditional seventh-round pick in the 2025 NFL draft.[25] He was released on September 9, 2024, after missing two field goals in the season opener against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.[26] On December 4, 2024, York was signed to the Cincinnati Bengals practice squad following an injury to starting kicker Evan McPherson.[27]",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. When you're a cheerleader for the Dallas Cowboys, it's pretty clear who you're rooting for every time you're on the field. However, one cheerleader may actually be rooting for the Cincinnati Bengals on Monday night, at least if the game comes down to a field goal. The Cowboys are hosting Cincinnati in Week 14, and when the Bengals arrived in town, they did so with a new kicker. With Evan McPherson on injured reserve, the Bengals went out and signed Cade York. The Bengals' new kicker met with the media Thursday, and during that session he revealed a very interesting fact about himself: He's dating a Cowboys cheerleader. \"My girlfriend is actually a cheerleader for the Cowboys,\" York said, via Fox 19. York's girlfriend is Zoe, who's been a Cowboys cheerleader since the start of the 2023 season. York's significant other was shown breathing a sigh of relief after York made his point-after attempt following the Bengals' first score. Bengals kicker and Dallas native Cade York drills they extra point, despite a delay of game penalty.His girlfriend Zoe Dale happens to be a Dallas Cowboys cheerleader: \"Praise God. Praise God.\" pic.twitter.com/pn7IIyUhrH With the Bengals and Cowboys both underperforming this year, the Monday night game isn't exactly must-see TV. However, this game might be worth watching for two reasons. First, ESPN is turning everyone into Simpsons characters. .@bengals & @dallascowboys...but make them Simpsons characters 👀@TheSimpsons Funday Football – December 9 at 8 PM on Disney+ and ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/Fnlpt4Z9GH Oh, and we also have a cheerleader on one team dating the kicker for the other team. That sounds like the plot of a Hallmark movie. A post shared by Zoë Dale (@zoedale__) York was hanging out with his girlfriend on Sunday, Dec. 1, and at that point, he had no idea he would be kicking for the Bengals this week. \"She got baptized on Sunday. So it was awesome getting to do that, and all her teammates got to come watch,\" York said. \"And then, literally, the next day I get a call that I'm going to work out for the Bengals, and they're playing on Monday, and I was like, 'Well, Zoe, I will see you at home no matter what.' So yeah, it's pretty cool.\" During his interview, York was asked who Zoe would be cheering for a Monday night and he didn't hesitate with his answer. \"She's going to be cheering for me,\" York said. For Zoe, the best-case scenario in this game would probably be a Cowboys win with York making all of his field goals and extra points. However, there is a very real chance that she could be forced to root for the Cowboys to lose if the game comes down to a field goal attempt by York in the final seconds. No matter what happens, York is planning to make sure he stays on good terms with his girlfriend during the game. \"She's already told me second quarter and fourth quarter is when she's on the visitor's side, so I'll have to sneak her a couple of smiles,\" York said. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

The emotional highlight came early in the game when York nailed an extra point to tie the score at 7-7. Cameras captured Dale, visibly anxious and then relieved, whispering, \"Praise God,\" as the kick sailed through the uprights. Her reaction, aired on ESPN, immediately resonated with viewers and quickly went viral. York later shared with CBS Sports that the weekend had been a whirlwind for both him and Dale. Just one day before his unexpected call from the Bengals, Dale celebrated her baptism, an event York described as \"awesome.\" \"All her teammates got to come watch,\" he said, adding that her newfound faith added a layer of significance to the week. By Monday night, York was not only stepping into a high-pressure role for Cincinnati but also playing with the support of Dale in a unique way. The Bengalsrode York's early success to a 17-10 halftime lead, and while York's kicks were crucial, it was Dale's support that drew headlines. The juxtaposition of her Cowboys uniform and her obvious joy for York turned her into an instant social media favorite. Fans took to Twitter to praise her authenticity and to comment on the rare vulnerability captured in a sport known for its stoicism. As York reflected post-game, he expressed gratitude not just for the opportunity to play but for the serendipity of sharing the moment with Dale. \"She's always cheering for me,\" he said with a smile, a sentiment that transcended team loyalties on this unforgettable night. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U.

The Cincinnati Bengals and Dallas Cowboys have evoked plenty of laughs this NFL season, if unintentionally: Cincy has racked up video-game offensive marks while struggling to stay afloat in the AFC North, while Dallas has battled injuries to remain relevant in the NFC East. On Monday, head to head in a pivotal matchup for last-gasp playoff hopes, they'll get some help on the comedic front from Springfield's most beloved yellow family. Following in the footsteps of CBS, which debuted an alternate Nickelodeon NFL broadcast during the 2020 playoffs, ESPN will present \"The Simpsons Funday Football\" for Bengals-Cowboys, taking \"Monday Night Football\" into the animated world of \"The Simpsons,\" the longest-running scripted series on prime-time American TV. Bart Simpson will be weaved into the programming in support of the Bengals, while Homer Simpson is set to pull for the Cowboys, with other \"Simpsons\" and Springfield elements packaged into the broadcast.

                "title": "The Simpsons on Monday Night Football: What to Expect, Where to Watch",
                "content": "By Michael Schneider Variety Editor at Large Not only does Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow look like Bart Simpson, but he’s starting to do some Bart Simpson-like things. Specifically, Burrow just spent $3 million on a Batmobile from the Christopher Nolan “Dark Knight” trilogy. “This is a very Bart move, to get a bunch of money and buy the Batmobile,” said “The Simpsons” executive producer Matt Selman. “Bart is the bad boy who’s almost like Joe Burrow. They both have spiky blonde hair too. It’s almost too beautiful to be true.” He’s why it’s a bit serendipitous: Bart Simpson will serve as Burrow’s Bengals coach on tonight’s NFL “Monday Night Football.” Well, sort of. In the latest unique NFL alt cast geared toward kids and families, Disney+, ESPN and “The Simpsons” producers have collaborated to “Simpsons”-ize the Monday night matchup between the Bengals and the Dallas Cowboys. While the game plays as usual on ABC and ESPN (and via the “Manningcast” on ESPN2), it will be animated “Simpsons”-style as “The Simpsons Funday Football” livestream Dec. 9 at 8 p.m. ET on Disney+ and ESPN+. Related Stories VIP+ Why Netflix’s Global Content Strategy Is Doubly Effective 'A Complete Unknown' Welcomes Timothée Chalamet to the Oscar Race (and Monica Barbaro, Too) “The whole thing is what I call an irresistible challenge, in that we are big NFL fans in ‘The Simpsons’ writers room , and love ESPN and all their big personalities,” Selman said. “How can we make a ‘Simpsons’ version of a live football game that feels ‘Simpsons’-y and also football-y? You want to balance the football with ‘The Simpsons,’ and that is the fun and the challenge.” Popular on Variety The three-hour event will incorporate the actual matchup with a “Simpsons” storyline, and unfurl in real time as the game transpires. After its initial live airing on Disney+ and ESPN+, “The Simpsons Funday Football” will be available 12 hours later on demand (for 30 days, only on Disney+). And in case you don’t have that kind of time, an edited highlights cutdown of “The Simpsons Funday Football” that clocks in closer to 40 minutes will be available soon after on Disney Channel, Disney XD, FX and FXX. The ambitious takeover will start off with a regular, 2-D “Simpsons” storyline, spearheaded by “Simpsons” writer Joel Cohen, in which Homer has a “hot dog fever dream” in which he imagines he’s coaching the Cowboys, facing off with Bart on the Bengals side. “Homer is mad at Bart and wants to beat Bart,” Selman said. “That’s the story, but you don’t need much more than that.” From that wrap-around, which includes a half-time cartoon segment as well, the ESPN production team has created thousands of different computer-generated moments featuring the citizens of Springfield, all of which will be peppered throughout the broadcast. Game play will appear in “Simpsons”-style animation thanks to motion-enabled tracking technology from NFL’s Next Gen Stats, Sony’s Beyond Sports and optical tracking from Sony’s Hawk-Eye Innovations. The tech will even allow “Simpsons” characters to take over at times for Bengals and Cowboys players. Michael “Spike” Szykowny, ESPN vice president, edit and animation, and ESPN senior creative director David “Sparky” Sparrgrove will be at the controls on Monday night, adding all of those “Simpsons” elements to the live game. It’s something they’ve been working on for months. “The ESPN producers really have the attitude of, ‘we’re going to work 24 hours a day’ to jam into as much ‘Simpsons’ content into this CGI football game as can possibly be done,” Selman said. “Spike and Sparky are going to sit there, like the Phantom of the Opera, plugging in all these visual sight gags and references and Easter eggs and predictions and jokes and visuals as the game progresses, in real time. “There’s all these fun, surprising pre-tapes that it’s up to the seasoned NFL ESPN producers to know when to insert those into the game during commercial breaks and timeouts and stuff like that,” he added. “I trust in Spike and Sparky. This is their time. They’re in the booth, at the control panel with the idea that, ‘if I got this button, ten different Ralph Wiggum things happen. If I hit this button, Krusty does a thing.’” Viewers will see the game play out at the Springfield Atoms stadium. On Homer’s side, “Moe’s Juice Bar” (family friendly, after all) has set up shop. On Bart’s side, it’s a version of Kamp Krusty, complete with video games and skateboard ramps. Other pre-produced pieces include inspiring half-time speeches by “Simpsons” characters like Moe, Krusty and Lisa. An animated version of ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith has some funny rants in store. Expect to see a reference to the now-infamous “Simpsons” ability to predict the future. And Selman promised a surprise guest star from the world of sports. Also, Marge and Lisa have banked interviews with the actual Cowboys and Bengals players — and “the football players were adorable in their answers,” Selman said. “They were very cute.” There’s still a game going on, but analysts Mina Kimes and Dan Orlovsky, as well as play-by-pay announcer Drew Carter, will be animated too, and call the game with “The Simpsons” in mind. “We gave them a ‘Simpsons’ reference cheat sheet, and peppered them with ‘Simpsons’ references for the game,” Selman said. “If I had to give the biggest ‘Simpsons’ nerd award, it would have to go to Mina. We’ve been emailing back and forth all week, ideas for deep cut ‘Simpsons’ references that she can jam into the game. Hopefully it’s a fun challenge for them to do a ‘Simpsons’-ified version of play-by-play and color commentary.” Selman said ESPN originally expected the Cowboys-Bengals matchup to be higher stakes at this point in the season. But with Cincinnati currently at 4-8 and Dallas at 5-7, the pressure is off a bit. But in a way, Selman said he expects more tune-in to the “Simpsons” version as a result. “Now it’s just a fun, great game with two teams that didn’t really hit their thresholds of excellence,” he said. And if Bart is like Burrow, then Homer bears a bit of a resemblance to Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy, he added. “The Simpsons” writers plan to watch the game on Monday in their offices — with a taco truck in tow. It’s a big week for the show and Disney+: On Friday, “The Simpsons” will hold a red carpet premiere event for “O C’mon All Ye Faithful,” a new holiday special that reps the first of several new exclusive installments of “The Simpsons” for Disney+. In this special, which launches Dec. 17, British mentalist Derren Brown hypnotizes Homer, who then believes he is Santa Claus. The two-part episode features music from Patti LaBelle and Pentatonix — and premieres 35 years to the day that the very first episode of “The Simpsons,” “Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire,” premiered in 1989. “We’ve never done a single, 40-minute long Christmas story with this much kind of emotional intensity,” Selman said. “It really feels like a movie. It has the deep emotion of cinema, in addition to being very funny. It’s almost Capra-esque. It’s a pretty sweet special.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment",

                "title": "More mysterious drones spotted over New Jersey's Bergen County",
                "content": "More mysterious drones were spotted “pacing back and forth” above New Jersey, new video shows — as government officials assured Garden State residents that there’s nothing to fear. The footage, captured by a New Jersey mom and shared on X, shows blinking lights buzzing over Bergen County on Sunday night. “They’re just pacing back and forth going very slow,” the mom said in the clip. “It doesn’t sound like a plane… no, no, it’s too quiet. That’s a drone,” she said, adding that she counted five or six flying machines hovering overhead. The spate of drone sightings across New Jersey has raised alarms among locals — who in recent weeks have filmed and posted countless videos of the unidentified aircraft to social media — and left local officials scratching their heads. But even as the sightings continue to confound authorities, Gov. Phil Murphy said residents need not worry — the drones pose “no known threat to the public at this time,” he wrote last week in a social media statement. “We are actively monitoring the situation and in close coordination with our federal and law enforcement partners on this matter,” he added. That provided little comfort to the frazzled residents of the Garden State, including Rachel Campos-Duffy, wife of Sean Duffy, President-elect Donald Trump’s next nominee for transportation secretary. “If you live in Morristown, Mendham, Summit, Bedminster, Far Hills — that whole area, that’s all you’re talking about,” she told Ainsley Earhardt on Fox & Friends on Monday, referencing a cluster of wealthy Morris County suburbs. “I think what you’re seeing is, first of all, no answers — whatever the governor put out was a non-answer, and it didn’t make me feel any better,” Campos-Duffy said. “And I don’t feel good — they’re flying low. They’re not up high like an airplane. They’re flying low, you can see them. And they’re large. They’re huge. These are not hobby drones.” “People are outraged,” she added. “Three weeks, no answers.” The feds have said they are looking into the mysterious sightings that began on Nov. 18, when cops first responded to calls about them hovering over Morris County. Since then, drones have appeared in the night over homes, neighborhoods and military installations across the state. “Unfortunately, we don’t have many answers, and we don’t want to guess or hypothesize about what’s going on,” FBI spokeswoman Amy J. Thoreson told NJ.com on Wednesday. “We are doing all we can to figure it out.” Meanwhile, conspiracy theorists are doing their best to fill in the gaps. Some say criminals are using the drones to case houses for future robberies, while others say they might be the eyes and ears of terrorists lurking in our midst, according to NJ.com. Still others say the Chinese or other hostile foreign nations are controlling the devices — while some go off the deep end completely and claim aliens have engineered the whole thing. Although cops haven’t commented on the slew of silliness, Pramod Abichandani, a professor who directs the Advanced Air Mobility Lab at New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark, told the outlet those explanations are unlikely. If the drones had a nefarious purpose, he said, they probably wouldn’t be so loud and visible. “It would be extremely careless on the part of people who are working for foreign powers to just expose themselves like that,” Abichandani said, adding that the machines probably belong to commercial or US military operators. “It takes an incredible amount of competence to do something nefarious with drones.” There have already been real-world consequences for the mechanical joyrides — such as when one of the drones disrupted a medevac helicopter set to airlift a patient. The scores of sightings also led the Federal Aviation Administration to restrict drone flights over Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County and the Trump National Golf Club in Somerset. “It’s a complete mystery,” Mark Chiarolanza, spokesman for the Morris County Sheriff’s Office, told NJ.com. “The best way we’re going to figure this out is if somebody can get a good, solid picture of these things,” he said, adding that some of the drones’ large size indicates a recreational group isn’t behind this. “We can’t knock these things out of the sky,” he continued. Meanwhile, more drones were spotted above Staten Island Thursday, prompting politicians to urge the feds to figure out their origin, according to the Staten Island Advance. People have seen them in eight counties since they were first spotted — from Bergen in the east to Hunterdon in the west, and near the Pennsylvania border — according to the Bergen Record.

Phil Murphy over the mysterious drones that have been spotted flying overhead in recent weeks. Since mid-November, large drones of uncertain origin have been repeatedly spotted in the sky at night over central and northern New Jersey. The drones, which are larger than the type typically used by hobbyists, have raised concerns due to their proximity to both a military installation and President-elect Donald Trump's Bedminster golf course. In the letter, the mayors in Morris County called for a full investigation into the drones \"to determine the origin, purpose and compliance with applicable regulations.\" They also demanded the \"implementation of measures to prevent unauthorized or unsafe drone operations\" in Morris County going forward, and \"clear communication to local officials, law enforcement and residents regarding the findings of this investigation.\" \"While the benefits of drone technology are widely recognized when used responsibly and transparently, the lack of information and clarity regarding these operations has caused fear and frustration among our constituents,\" the mayors wrote. \"Despite inquiries made to relevant authorities, we have yet to receive satisfactory answers about the purpose, operators, or safety protocols governing these flights.\" The Federal Aviation Administration has imposed drone flight restrictions while authorities investigate. Local police previously said there is no known threat to public safety. \"Morris County Sheriff James M. Gannon would like to inform everyone that the recent drone activity observed by many in our communities is being actively investigated. There is no advisable immediate danger to the public at this time,\" the Morris County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. Last week, multiple Morris and Somerset county officials said in a joint statement they would continue to monitor the drone activity. \"County and local law enforcement agencies are aware of the recurring reports of drone activity around Morris and Somerset counties, and acknowledge the public's concern about these repeated sightings,\" they said. On Monday, a spokesperson for the FBI said the agency is \"doing all we can figure out what's going on.\" \"The public can continue to call our 800 line, or submit a tip online, we are acting on every substantive lead that we get,\" the FBI spokesperson said. In an interview on Fox News Monday, New York Rep. Nicole Malliotakis said members of the public \"deserve and demand answers\" about the drones. \"I've also reached out to FAA, to the Department of Homeland Security and to the FBI asking for answers, and they are aware of these aircrafts. They are either unmanned aircrafts or drones and they are still trying to figure out where they are coming from and who's behind them.

Since mid-November, local residents in several counties in New Jersey have reported seeing clusters of drones – and in recent days, additional drone sightings have been reported in parts of Pennsylvania and New York’s Staten Island. Local residents in the regions have been capturing and sharing footage online that appears to show drones in the sky. Last week, the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Newark office announced it was actively investigating these sightings and was seeking information from the public. “Witnesses have spotted the cluster of what look to be drones and a possible fixed wing aircraft,” the FBI said. “We have reports from the public and law enforcement dating back several weeks.” While authorities investigate the reports, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has implemented temporary flight restrictions in the areas over Picatinny Arsenal military base and Trump National Golf Club Bedminster. The origin of the drones remains unknown. However, state leaders and elected officials have said that they are monitoring the sightings and have assured residents that the drones do not pose any immediate threat to the public. In a post on social media last week, Phil Murphy, New Jersey’s governor, said that he convened with officials from the Department of Homeland Security as well as local authorities and officials in New Jersey to discuss the reported drone activity. “We are actively monitoring the situation and in close coordination with our federal and law enforcement partners on this matter,” the governor said.

They also called for improved communication with residents and law enforcement, among other things.

In response to reports of drones over Staten Island’s airspace, the congresswoman Nicole Malliotakis said she asked the FAA to impose temporary drone flight restrictions in the area and had requested immediate briefings from the homeland security department and FBI. Two weeks ago, drones flying in New Jersey reportedly prevented a medical helicopter from picking up an injured individual after a car crash, according to USA Today. The police chief of Florham Park, New Jersey, Joseph Orlando, said in a statement on social media last week that several drone sightings had been reported above “critical infrastructure such as water reservoirs, electric transmission lines, rail stations, police departments and military installations. “Members of the local law enforcement community have been pressuring our partners for answers regarding this activity as their presence around our critical infrastructure is concerning,” the statement reads. “While we currently have no evidence or information to indicate these drones pose an imminent threat at this time, their presence appears nefarious in nature.” In the statement, authorities urged all residents to remain vigilant and report any drone sightings directly to the FBI.",

                "content": "West Ham United's Jarrod Bowen struck midway through the second half to secure a deserved 2-1 Premier League home win on Monday over Wolverhampton Wanderers, whose poor defending cost them again as they languish second-bottom in the standings. Wolves conceded three minutes after equalising to stay in 19th spot on nine points from 15 games, while West Ham are 14th with 18 points. The 38 goals Wolves have conceded is the highest total in the top flight this season. The game featured a minute's applause after the ninth minute for 34-year-old Hammers striker Michail Antonio, who is recovering in hospital following surgery on a fractured leg sustained in a car crash on Saturday. With both managers -- West Ham's Julen Lopetegui and Wolves' Gary O'Neil -- struggling to turn things around after their teams' disappointing starts to the season, the pre-match talk was all about whose job was most at risk. After forcing a slew of set pieces in a scoreless first half, it was Lopetegui's Hammers who broke the deadlock in the 54th minute through Tomás Soucek from their 10th corner. The Wolves defence left the Czech midfielder unmarked at the far post to send a looping header across goal into the net. The goal was the eighth Wolves have conceded from a corner and the 15th from a set piece excluding penalties this season, more than any other top flight team. Wolves managed to level through Matt Doherty in the 69th minute with a superbly taken scooped volley into the corner shortly after they had a strong penalty appeal turned town. The lead was short-lived asWolves' defensive frailties were exposed again, with Bowen jinking onto his left foot in the box before burying the ball in the corner three minutes later. Deflated after conceding so soon following their equaliser, Wolves struggled to create any momentum and, a few harmless off-target shots aside, they barely threatened the West Ham goal in the final minutes as the hosts held on comfortably to win. Soucek revealed after the game that the team had spoken to Antonio on a video call earlier on Monday. \"The goal was for him. I dedicated it to him. I said before the game I really wanted to score even more today. He's been here since I came here. He's really my favourite,\" he told Sky Sports, adding he could not wait to visit his recovering teammate. Wolves coach O'Neil admitted he was under pressure, but insisted that his team were still giving it their all. \"I'm bit disappointed for them, really, because it was a decent away performance under a lot of pressure,\" he told Sky Sports. \"I can only ask them to give what they give, and they're giving absolutely everything, so I hope the supporters are still proud of what they see from the players.\"",

                "content": "The Minnesota Timberwolves (often referred to as the Wolves) are an American professional basketball team based in Minneapolis. The Timberwolves compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Northwest Division of the Western Conference.[8] The team was founded in 1989. Its majority owner is Glen Taylor, who also owns the WNBA's Minnesota Lynx.[9] Currently, Taylor is in a legal battle over ownership of the team with Alex Rodriguez, Marc Lore, and Michael Bloomberg.[10] The Timberwolves play their home games at Target Center, their home since 1990.[11] Like most expansion teams, the Timberwolves struggled in their early years, but after the acquisition of Kevin Garnett in the 1995 NBA draft, the team qualified for the playoffs in eight consecutive seasons from 1997 to 2004. Despite losing in the first round in their first seven attempts, the Timberwolves won their first division championship in 2004 and advanced to the Western Conference finals that same season. Garnett was also named the NBA Most Valuable Player for that season.[12] The team then went into rebuilding mode for more than a decade after missing the postseason in 2005, and trading Garnett to the Boston Celtics in 2007.[13] Garnett returned to the Timberwolves in a February 2015 trade and finished his career there, retiring in the 2016 off-season. The Timberwolves ended a 14-year playoff drought when they returned to the postseason in 2018. NBA basketball returned to the Twin Cities in 1989 for the first time since the Minneapolis Lakers (1947–1960) departed to Los Angeles in 1960. The NBA had granted one of its four new expansion teams on April 22, 1987 (the others being the Orlando Magic, Charlotte Hornets, and the Miami Heat) to original owners Harvey Ratner and Marv Wolfenson to begin play beginning in the 1989–90 season. There were two previous American Basketball Association (ABA) franchises that played in between the Lakers' departure and the Timberwolves arrival: the Minnesota Muskies (1967–68), and the Minnesota Pipers (1968–69). The Timberwolves have worn throwback uniforms for each of the previous franchises.[14][15] The franchise conducted a \"name the team\" contest[16] and eventually selected two finalists, \"Timberwolves\" and \"Polars\", in December 1986. The team then asked the 842 city councils in Minnesota to select the winner and \"Timberwolves\" prevailed by nearly 2–1.[17][18] The team was officially named the \"Minnesota Timberwolves\" on January 23, 1987. Minnesota is home to the largest population of timberwolves in the contiguous 48 states.[19] The Timberwolves debuted on November 3, 1989, losing to the Seattle SuperSonics on the road 106–94. Five days later, they made their home debut at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, losing to the Chicago Bulls 96–84. Two nights later on November 10, the Wolves got their first win, beating the Philadelphia 76ers at home 125–118. The Timberwolves, led by Tony Campbell with 23.2 ppg, went on to a 22–60 record, finishing in sixth place in the Midwest Division. Playing in the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, the expansion Timberwolves set an NBA record by drawing over 1 million fans to their home games.[20] This included a crowd of 49,551 on April 17, 1990, which saw the Timberwolves lose to the Denver Nuggets 99–88 in the final home game of the season.[21] The next season, the team moved into their permanent home, the Target Center, and improved somewhat, finishing 29–53. However, they fired their head coach, Bill Musselman. They fared far worse in the 1991–92 NBA season under Musselman's successor, ex-Celtics coach Jimmy Rodgers, finishing with an NBA-worst 15–67 record. Looking to turn the corner, the Wolves hired former Detroit Pistons general manager Jack McCloskey to the same position, but even with notable first-round selections such as Christian Laettner and Isaiah Rider, the Timberwolves were unable to duplicate McCloskey's \"Detroit Bad Boys\" success in the Twin Cities, finishing 19–63 and 20–62 the next two seasons. One of the few highlights from that era was when the Target Center served as host of the 1994 All-Star Game where Rider won the Slam Dunk Contest with his between-the-leg \"East Bay Funk Dunk\".[22] As winning basketball continued to elude the Wolves, Ratner and Wolfenson nearly sold the team to New Orleans interests in 1994 before NBA owners rejected the proposed move. Eventually, Glen Taylor bought the team and named Kevin McHale general manager. The Wolves finished 21–61 in 1994–95, and the future looked bleak.[23] In the 1995 NBA draft, the Timberwolves selected high school standout Kevin Garnett in the first round (5th overall),[24] and Flip Saunders was named head coach. Christian Laettner was traded along with Sean Rooks to the Atlanta Hawks for Andrew Lang and Spud Webb. Also, first-round pick Donyell Marshall was traded the previous season for Golden State Warriors' forward Tom Gugliotta. These trades paved the way for rookie Kevin Garnett to become the go-to player inside. Garnett went on to average 10.4 ppg in his rookie season as the Wolves finished in 5th place in the Midwest Division, with a 26–56 record.[23] In 1996, the Wolves added another star player in the draft, trading Ray Allen to the Milwaukee Bucks for the rights to Stephon Marbury, the 4th overall pick. The addition of Marbury had a positive effect on the entire team, as Garnett and Gugliotta became the first Wolves to be selected to the All-Star team. Gugliotta and Garnett led the Timberwolves in scoring as the team made the playoffs for the first time in franchise history with a record of 40–42. However, in the playoffs the Timberwolves made a quick exit as they were swept by the Houston Rockets in three straight games.[25] The T-Wolves also decided to change their image by changing their team logo and color scheme, adding black to the team colors and replacing the original logo with one featuring a snarling wolf looming over a field of trees. It was also during this season that Minnesota began to play on a parquet floor. In 1997, Garnett and Marbury established themselves as two of the brightest rising stars in the NBA. Garnett averaged 18.5 ppg and 9.6 rebounds per game, while Marbury averaged 17.7 ppg and dished out 8.6 assists per game. Despite losing leading scorer Tom Gugliotta for half the season, the Timberwolves went on to post their first winning season at 45–37, making the playoffs for the second straight season. After dropping Game 1 of the playoffs on the road to the Seattle SuperSonics, the Timberwolves won their first postseason game in Game 2, winning in Seattle 98–93. As the series shifted to Minnesota, the Timberwolves had an opportunity to pull off the upset as they won Game 3 by a score of 98–90. However, the Wolves dropped Game 4 at home as the Sonics went on to win the series in five games.[26] In 1998, a year after signing Kevin Garnett to a six-year, $126 million contract, the Timberwolves were then used as the poster child of irresponsible spending as the NBA endured a four-month lockout that wiped out much of the season. With an already cap-heavy payroll, the Wolves let Tom Gugliotta walk, partially because the team wanted to save money in order to sign Stephon Marbury to a long-term contract, and in part because Gugliotta did not want to play with the young player. This move proved unsuccessful, however, as Stephon Marbury wanted to be the biggest star on a team and subsequently forced an in-season trade by refusing a contract extension. In the three-team mid-season deal that sent Marbury to the New Jersey Nets, the Wolves got Terrell Brandon in return and a first-round draft pick in the 1999 draft (which turned out to be the sixth pick). The Wolves made the playoffs for the third straight season by finishing in fourth place with a 25–25 record. In the playoffs, the Timberwolves were beaten by the eventual champion San Antonio Spurs in four games.[27] In 1999, the Timberwolves drafted Wally Szczerbiak with the sixth pick in the draft.[28] He had a solid season, finishing third on the team in scoring with 11.6 points per game. Led by Kevin Garnett, who averaged 22.9 points per game and 11.8 rebounds per game, the Timberwolves had their first 50-win season and finished in 3rd place with a record of 50–32. However, in the playoffs the Wolves again fell in the first round, losing to the Portland Trail Blazers in four games.[29] The Wolves opened the 1999–2000 regular season with two home games against the Sacramento Kings at the Tokyo Dome on November 6 and 7. In the summer of 2000, guard Malik Sealy was killed in a car accident by a drunk driver. Sealy's number has since been retired: the number 2 jersey memorialized with Sealy's name on a banner hanging from the rafters of Target Center. It remains the only number retired by the team.[30] Also in that season, a free agent deal signed by Joe Smith was voided by the NBA, who ruled that the Timberwolves violated proper procedure in signing the contract. The league stripped the Timberwolves of five draft picks (first round 2001–2005), but it was eventually reduced to three first-round picks (2001, 2002, and 2004). The league also fined the Timberwolves $3.5 million and suspended general manager Kevin McHale for one year. Smith eventually signed with the Detroit Pistons before re-signing with the Timberwolves in 2001. Despite those setbacks, the Timberwolves made the playoffs for the fifth straight season with a 47–35 record.[31] In the playoffs, the Timberwolves were eliminated in the first round again by the San Antonio Spurs in four games in the spring of 2001.[32] A number of newcomers arrived prior to the start of the next season, including Gary Trent, Loren Woods and Maurice Evans and the return of Joe Smith. The Timberwolves started the season by winning their first six games and went on to achieve a franchise-best start of 30–10. The Timberwolves had a franchise-record 53-point win over Chicago in November. They finished with a 50–32 record: their second-ever 50-win season that was highlighted by another All-Star appearance by Garnett and a breakout season by Wally Szczerbiak, who earned his first All-Star appearance. Once again, Minnesota lost in the first round of the playoffs, where they were swept by the Dallas Mavericks in three straight games.[33] The 2002–03 season seemed to look up for the Timberwolves. Garnett had a great season where he finished second in MVP voting with 23.0 points per game and 13.4 rebounds per game and the Timberwolves finished in third place with a 51–31 record. As a result, they were awarded home-court advantage for the first time when facing the three-time defending champion Los Angeles Lakers. After losing at home in Game 1, the Timberwolves had a chance to take a 3–1 series lead heading into the 4th quarter of Game 4 in Los Angeles, but the Lakers came back to win the game and eventually won the series in six games. In the end, the Timberwolves were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs for the seventh straight year.[34] In 2003, Rob Babcock was promoted to vice-president of player personnel. He and general manager Kevin McHale made a series of strong off-season moves in an attempt to get the team over the hump and beyond the first round of the playoffs. They made two important trades, sending away forward Joe Smith and guard Terrell Brandon in a multi-player deal for Ervin Johnson, Sam Cassell and embattled guard Latrell Sprewell. They also signed sharp-shooter Fred Hoiberg, and former first overall pick Michael Olowokandi as free agents, with both becoming key contributors during the season. The Timberwolves rounded out their bench by signing veteran role players Trenton Hassell, Troy Hudson, and Mark Madsen. Despite injuries to a revitalized Olowokandi (who missed half the season) and 6th man Wally Szczerbiak (who only played in 28 games), the revamped Timberwolves became the team to beat during the 2003–04 NBA season, finishing the season as the top seed in the Western Conference with a record of 58–24. Garnett had his best season to date, and both Sprewell and Cassell had career years as well. Garnett and Cassell both made the all-star team, and after the season, Garnett was named 1st Team All NBA, and earned his first MVP award averaging 24.2 points, 13.9 rebounds and 5.0 assists per game.[35] During the 2004 NBA playoffs, the Wolves won their first-ever playoff series against the Denver Nuggets, before beating the Sacramento Kings in a hard-fought seven-game series to advance to the franchise's first Western Conference finals. Kevin Garnett leapt upon the scorer's table upon the winning Game 7 in the Sacramento series, which became one of the more iconic moments in Minnesota sports history. The Timberwolves' run ended in the Western Conference finals as the team lost to the Los Angeles Lakers. Sam Cassell injured his groin during Game 7 against the Kings, doing his infamous big balls dance after knocking down the series-clinching bucket, and as a result, played only sparingly during the Lakers series. Many around the NBA, including both Flip Saunders and Phil Jackson believe that had he been healthy, the Wolves would have advanced to the finals.[36][37] Going into the 2004–05 season, the Wolves roster remained virtually the same from the previous season; however, Babcock left to become the general manager of the Toronto Raptors, and the team was also plagued with contract disputes and the complaining of key players Latrell Sprewell, Sam Cassell, and Troy Hudson during the off-season. After a disappointing start to the season, head coach Flip Saunders was replaced by general manager and long-time friend Kevin McHale, who took over as coach for the rest of the season. Despite a strong finish, the Timberwolves missed the playoffs for the first time in eight years, by one game, to the Memphis Grizzlies, ending the season with a record of 44–38. During the 2005 off-season, McHale and the Wolves started their search for a head coach. McHale interviewed Seattle SuperSonics assistant coach Dwane Casey, San Antonio Spurs assistant P. J. Carlesimo, former coach John Lucas and Wolves assistants Randy Wittman, Sidney Lowe and Jerry Sichting, among others. On June 17, 2005, the Timberwolves hired Casey as the new head coach. It was Casey's first head coaching job, making him the Wolves' seventh head coach in their 16-year history.[38] In the 2005 draft, the Timberwolves selected Rashad McCants, a shooting guard from North Carolina with the 14th overall pick of the first round.[39] The Timberwolves also selected Bracey Wright, a guard from Indiana, with the 17th pick of the second round (47th overall).[40] During the off-season, they traded All-Star Sam Cassell and a protected future first-round draft pick to the Los Angeles Clippers for Marko Jarić and Lionel Chalmers. They also signed free agent Nikoloz Tskitishvili.[41] On January 26, 2006, the Wolves traded forward Wally Szczerbiak, centers Dwayne Jones and Michael Olowokandi, and a future first-round draft pick to the Boston Celtics. In return, they received forward-guard Ricky Davis, center Mark Blount, forward Justin Reed, guard Marcus Banks, and two second-round draft picks. In a separate trade on the same day, the Timberwolves traded Tskitishvili to the Phoenix Suns for a 2006 second-round draft pick. The Timberwolves finished 33–49, missing the playoffs for the second consecutive year.[42] In the 2006 NBA draft, the Timberwolves selected future NBA Rookie of the Year Brandon Roy with the 6th overall pick, Craig Smith with the 36th pick, forward Bobby Jones with the 37th pick and center Loukas Mavrokefalidis with the 57th pick. The Timberwolves traded Roy to the Portland Trail Blazers for Randy Foye and cash considerations. The Timberwolves then traded Bobby Jones to the Philadelphia 76ers for a 2007 second-round pick and cash. On January 23, McHale fired head coach Casey and replaced him with Randy Wittman. McHale explained in a news conference that it was inconsistency by Casey that led to the firing. Casey had compiled an overall record of 53–69. They finished the 2006–07 season with a record of 32–50, allowing them to keep their 2007 first-round pick.[43] On July 31, 2007, the Minnesota Timberwolves reached a deal to trade All-Star Kevin Garnett to the Boston Celtics for Al Jefferson, Theo Ratliff, Gerald Green, Sebastian Telfair, Ryan Gomes, two first-round draft picks, and cash considerations. This is the largest combination of players and picks ever traded for a single player in NBA history.[44][45] Garnett and the Celtics went on to win the 2008 NBA Finals in six games over the Los Angeles Lakers. That summer, the Timberwolves traded Mike James and Justin Reed to the Houston Rockets for Juwan Howard.[46] In October of the same year, the Timberwolves waived Howard after reaching a contractual buyout agreement, worth $10 million of roughly $14.25 million which Minnesota would have owed him. The team also traded Ricky Davis and Mark Blount to the Miami Heat in exchange for the Heat's Antoine Walker, Michael Doleac, Wayne Simien, and a 2008 protected first-round draft pick. In the 2007 NBA draft the Timberwolves selected Corey Brewer, with the 7th pick, and Chris Richard with the 41st overall pick, both being from the two-time NCAA national champion Florida Gators.[47] Minnesota began the NBA preseason with two games in London and Istanbul, as part of NBA Europe Live 2007. On October 10, The Wolves lost to Garnett and the revamped Celtics, 92–81. To start the season, the Wolves began 0–5 before ending the drought with a home win over the Sacramento Kings. That drought also brought about speculation of the possible dismissal of coach Wittman. The youngest team in the NBA began adjusting to life after trading franchise star Garnett to Boston, meanwhile playing without budding talent Randy Foye for the first half of the season. Guards Sebastian Telfair and Marko Jarić were deputized as starting point guards during Foye's injury absence. The Timberwolves finished the season 22–60.[48] On a handful of occasions during the season, the team showed flashes of its potential in wins or very close contests with top-tier teams. In the 2008 NBA draft, the Timberwolves selected O. J. Mayo of USC with the third overall pick. When the draft concluded, the Timberwolves traded Mayo, Antoine Walker, Greg Buckner, and Marko Jarić to the Memphis Grizzlies in exchange for fifth overall pick Kevin Love, Mike Miller, Jason Collins, and Brian Cardinal in a move that Jim Stack called, \"a deal we couldn't pass up.\"[49] In 2008, in celebration of the franchise's 20th anniversary, the team unveiled an updated version of its logo and uniforms.[50] The new designs first appeared in the first preseason game against the Chicago Bulls at United Center on October 14, 2008. They also refurbished the floor at Target Center, returning to the traditional floor pattern and added touches of varnish while exposing most of the hardwood. On December 8, 2008, after a 23-point loss to the Los Angeles Clippers that dropped the team to 4–15, the Timberwolves fired head coach Wittman and McHale took over. McHale also relinquished his vice president of basketball operations duties. It was unclear whether McHale's future with the team was dependent on the success or progress of the team which he had put together over the previous four years. Those questions seemed to be answered when the Timberwolves went 10–4 for the month of January, giving McHale the coach of the month honors. But on February 8, 2009, the team's main star Al Jefferson tore his ACL in his right knee in a game at New Orleans, sidelining him for the rest of the season. At the time of the injury, Jefferson was having his best season to date, averaging 23 points, 11 rebounds and 2 blocks.[51] Without Jefferson and Corey Brewer (who also suffered a season-ending injury), the Wolves sputtered, to finish with a 24–58 record.[52] On June 17, 2009, new president of basketball operations David Kahn announced that McHale would not be returning to the team as head coach. Kahn did not give a specific reason for McHale's dismissal, only saying \"this is going to be a transition period.\" For his part, McHale said he wanted to come back but was not offered a contract. Later, in August, the Timberwolves announced the signing of Kurt Rambis, then an assistant for the Los Angeles Lakers, to a four-year, $8 million contract to be their new head coach. In Rambis's first season, the team stumbled to the second-worst record in the league, as their 15–67 record was only surpassed by that of the New Jersey Nets, who finished at 12–70.[53] On July 12, 2010, Minnesota traded for Miami Heat forward Michael Beasley, the second pick from the 2008 NBA draft.[54] In a locally untelevised game on November 12, 2010, Kevin Love grabbed a franchise-record 31 rebounds and scored 31 points in a win over the New York Knicks, the NBA's first 30–30 game in 28 years.[55] Love was later named an All Star for the 2010–11 NBA season, the franchise's first All Star selection since Kevin Garnett in 2007. Love would later break Garnett's team record of 37 straight double-doubles on February 8, 2011, in a win over the Houston Rockets. On March 8, 2011, Love acquired his 52nd straight double-double, surpassing the mark of Moses Malone for the most consecutive double-doubles since the NBA-ABA merger in a win over the Indiana Pacers. The streak eventually reached 53 games and came to an end with a six-point, 12-rebound performance in a 100–77 loss to the Golden State Warriors on March 13. In October 2011, Love was ranked 16th among active players by ESPN.[56] On February 21, 2011, Corey Brewer and Kosta Koufos were traded to the New York Knicks and Denver Nuggets respectively for Knicks Anthony Randolph and Eddy Curry (plus $3 million in cash from New York and a 2015 second-round draft pick from Denver) as part of a larger trade that sent all-star Carmelo Anthony from Denver to New York.[57] On the downside, with a 121–102 loss to the Houston Rockets, the Timberwolves fell to 17–65, finishing last in the Western Conference for the second straight year. They also clinched the 2010–11 NBA season's worst record. During the off-season, the Timberwolves were finally able to bring 2009 fifth overall pick Ricky Rubio over from Spain. In the 2011 NBA draft, with the second overall pick, the Timberwolves selected Derrick Williams of Arizona. The Timberwolves then traded guard Jonny Flynn and the draft rights to Donatas Motiejūnas (No. 20) to the Houston Rockets for center Brad Miller, the draft rights to Nikola Mirotić (No. 23), Chandler Parsons (No. 38) and a future first-round pick. The Timberwolves traded Mirotic's rights to the Chicago Bulls for the rights to Norris Cole (No. 28) and Malcolm Lee (No. 43). The Timberwolves then sold the rights to Parsons back to the Rockets. The Timberwolves traded Norris Cole (No. 28) to the Miami Heat for the draft rights to Bojan Bogdanovic (No. 31), a future second-round pick and cash considerations. The Timberwolves then traded Bogdanovic's rights to the New Jersey Nets for a future second-rounder and cash. The Trail Blazers traded the draft rights to Tanguy Ngombo (No. 57) to the Timberwolves.[58] On July 12, 2011, Kurt Rambis was fired as coach of the team after compiling a 32–132 record in two seasons with the team. On September 13, 2011, the team announced that they had hired Rick Adelman to be the team's new head coach.[59][60] The Timberwolves began the 2011–12 NBA season with a 17–17 record before the All-Star break.[61] On March 9, 2012, Rubio tore his left ACL and LCL in a collision with Kobe Bryant. The injury ended his season and severely hurt the Timberwolves' chances of making the playoffs. Despite being in contention at mid-season, the team ultimately failed to reach the postseason for the eighth straight year due to injuries to a number of key players.[62][63][64] The team finished with a record of 26–40, with the only win of the team's final 14 games coming against the Detroit Pistons. The team traded the 18th overall pick of the 2012 NBA draft to the Houston Rockets for Chase Budinger.[65][66][67][68] On June 26, 2012, the Timberwolves selected Robbie Hummel with the 58th overall pick, the team's only selection during the draft.[69] During the off-season, the team signed former Timberwolves draft pick Brandon Roy to a two-year, $10 million contract.[70] The deal was announced on July 31.[71] With the inclusion of Roy in the shooting guard position, players that also signed during the off-season included Andrei Kirilenko, Alexey Shved and Louis Amundson. While technically in playoff contention early, multiple injuries began to plague the team. Roy, Budinger, Lee and free-agent signing Josh Howard succumbed to knee injuries. The mood of despair was shortly lifted by the splashy return of Rubio.[72] But not long after, Love, who missed the first nine games of the season after fracturing the third and fourth metacarpals in his right hand in a preseason home workout, suffered a recurrence of the injury in a win over the Denver Nuggets on January 3.[73] One of the few highlights in the second half of the season was Rubio's triple-double performance during a surprising win over the then-first place San Antonio Spurs, albeit without Spurs stars Tony Parker and Tim Duncan playing due to injury.[74] On April 6, in a game against the Detroit Pistons, Adelman won his 1000th game as a head coach.[75] This season marked the first time the franchise had won at least 30 games without Kevin Garnett on the roster.[76] The team decided to part ways with David Kahn after the season ended, with Flip Saunders being brought in to replace him.[77] In the 2013 NBA draft, the team traded the 9th overall pick Trey Burke for Shabazz Muhammad (14th pick) and Gorgui Dieng (21st pick) in the first round from the Utah Jazz.[78] On March 28, 2014, the Timberwolves set a franchise record for points in a regular season game with a 143–107 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. The win also marked the Timberwolves' first season-series win over the Lakers since the 2005–06 season.[79] The team accumulated 40 wins for the first time since the 2004–05 season, but missed the playoffs for the tenth consecutive year, despite holding the league's highest point differential at the end of the season.[80] On April 21, 2014, Rick Adelman announced his retirement from coaching in the NBA. Adelman acquired a 97–133 record in three seasons with the team. On August 23, 2014, the Timberwolves, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Philadelphia 76ers agreed on a three-way trade that would send Kevin Love to the Cavaliers to join LeBron James and Kyrie Irving. Minnesota received Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, Thaddeus Young, and a trade exception as part of the deal. The 76ers received Alexey Shved, Luc Mbah a Moute, and a 2015 first-round pick via the Miami Heat.[81] The 2014–15 season marked a new era for the Timberwolves, beginning with the Kevin Love trade. Flip Saunders was promoted to head coach, making it his second stint with the Timberwolves after coaching the team from 1995 to 2005. The Timberwolves started the new season with a 105–101 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies, with Wiggins making his debut. The team recorded its first win the following game, a 97–91 victory over the Detroit Pistons.[82] On November 12, 2014, the Timberwolves played an international home game at Mexico City Arena against the Houston Rockets. The Timberwolves had a 16–66 record for the season and missed the playoffs for the 11th consecutive year. Despite this, Wiggins was selected as the NBA Rookie of the Year, the first player in franchise history to be so honored. Draft pick Zach LaVine gained league notoriety after winning the Slam Dunk Contest. LaVine and Wiggins, dubbed \"The Bounce Brothers\", were seen as being the future of the franchise.[83] Due to having the worst record in the NBA for the 2014–15 season, the Timberwolves had the highest chance, at 25%, to receive the first pick in the 2015 NBA draft at the 2015 NBA draft lottery. On May 19, the Timberwolves received the first overall pick in the 2015 NBA draft for the first time in franchise history. On June 25, the Timberwolves selected Karl-Anthony Towns as the number one pick and acquired Minnesota's own Tyus Jones through a trade with the Cleveland Cavaliers. The 2015 season also saw the return of Kevin Garnett. In February, Garnett, at the time with the Brooklyn Nets, waived his no-trade clause to enable a trade back to Minnesota which sent Thaddeus Young to Brooklyn. In his first game back, Garnett resumed wearing the No. 21 jersey that had not been worn by any other Timberwolves player since his departure and the team defeated the Washington Wizards 97–77 at the Target Center. On June 6, 2014, Flip Saunders was named the head coach of the Minnesota Timberwolves, returning to the franchise for a second stint.[84] During his second stint with the Timberwolves, Saunders was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. As a result, during his recovery, he would delegate his coaching position over to assistant coach and former NBA Coach of the Year winner Sam Mitchell. On October 25, 2015, Saunders died at age 60. Mitchell took over as head coach. In honor of Saunders, the team announced that they would wear a patch reading \"FLIP\" on their uniforms for the duration of the 2015–16 season.[85] On April 20, 2016, the Timberwolves agreed to sign Tom Thibodeau to be their head coach and president of basketball operations. He was previously an assistant coach for the team from 1989 to 1991.[86] On September 23, 2016, Kevin Garnett announced his retirement after 21 seasons in the NBA. He expressed interest in playing one more year for the Timberwolves but felt that his knees would be unable to hold up for the duration of the season. The Timberwolves ended their season with a 31–51 record, having only a two-game improvement from their previous season. On June 22, 2017, the Timberwolves acquired Jimmy Butler and the 16th overall pick in the 2017 draft in trade for Zach Lavine, Kris Dunn and the 7th overall pick in the draft (used to select Lauri Markkanen).[87] This trade marked the end of the LaVine and Wiggins duo, dubbed \"Bounce Brothers\". Later that night, the Timberwolves selected center Justin Patton with the 16th overall pick in the draft. Later, the team added Taj Gibson, Jeff Teague, Jamal Crawford and Derrick Rose during free agency. The Timberwolves ended their season with a 47–35 record, which became the first winning season since the 2004–05 season, and secured the last spot in the playoffs on the final day of the regular season with a 112–106 win over the Denver Nuggets. The 2017–18 season also ended the longest streak without a playoff appearance at 13 seasons. The Timberwolves would be eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Houston Rockets in five games. On November 12, 2018, the Timberwolves traded Butler and Justin Patton to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for Robert Covington, Dario Šarić, Jerryd Bayless and a 2022 second-round draft pick.[88] On January 6, 2019, Thibodeau was fired as head coach and president of basketball operations. After Thibodeau's firing, it was announced that Ryan Saunders would serve as interim head coach until a permanent head coach is found.[89] On May 1, it was announced that the Timberwolves had hired Gersson Rosas, who previously served as the Houston Rockets' executive vice president of basketball operations, as their new president of basketball operations.[90] On May 20, after conducting interviews with several candidates, the Timberwolves announced that Ryan Saunders had been hired to a multi-year deal to become the team's permanent head coach, removing his \"interim\" status.[91][92] With Rosas' hiring, the Timberwolves also made several front office changes in the organization. The Timberwolves held both a first- and second-round draft pick in the 2019 NBA draft. The 11th pick (which was Cameron Johnson) along with Dario Šarić was traded to the Suns in exchange for the 6th pick in Jarrett Culver, a small forward from Texas Tech. With the 43rd pick, the Timberwolves selected Jaylen Nowell, a point guard from Washington. They would also sign Naz Reid, and undrafted center from Louisiana State.[93] On February 6, 2020, The Timberwolves traded Andrew Wiggins to the Golden State Warriors for Karl-Anthony Towns' longtime friend D'Angelo Russell. At the season's end the Timberwolves got the 1st pick in the 2020 NBA draft.[94] With that pick, the team drafted Anthony Edwards out of Georgia.[95] In that same draft, they would trade up to select Jaden McDaniels with the 28th pick.[96] On February 21, 2021, head coach Ryan Saunders was fired, and Toronto Raptors assistant coach Chris Finch was hired to replace him.[97][98] The Timberwolves finished the season 23-49 and missed the playoffs.[99] In April 2021, the Timberwolves announced that owner Glen Taylor had reached a deal with Marc Lore and Alex Rodriguez to sell the team. According to the deal, Lore and Rodriguez would become majority owners over the course of two years. On July 21, 2021, it was announced that Lore and Rodriguez had purchased 20% of the team. They went on to purchase 20% more in 2022 before the deal stalled in 2024. The transaction also includes ownership in the Timberwolves' WNBA sister-club, the Minnesota Lynx.[100] The deal valued the team at $1.5 billion.[101] In the off-season the Wolves traded guard Ricky Rubio to the Cleveland Cavaliers for forward Taurean Prince.[102] The Wolves then acquired guard Patrick Beverley in exchange for Juancho Hernangomez and former first round pick Jarrett Culver.[103] The final move they made was signing former 2020 draft pick Leandro Bolmaro to a 4-year, 11.8-million-dollar rookie contract.[104] On September 22, 2021, after Gersson Rosas was relieved of his President of Basketball Operations duties,[105] Sachin Gupta was promoted as the new interim president of basketball operations, while keeping his role as EVP of basketball operations.[106] The Timberwolves finished the 2021–22 season with a 46–36 record, the second-most regular season wins since making the conference finals in 2004. Despite All-Star Karl-Anthony Towns fouling out with 11 points in 24 minutes, the Wolves beat the Los Angeles Clippers in the play-in game to secure their spot in the 2022 NBA playoffs. The Timberwolves were eliminated by the Memphis Grizzlies in the first round in six games.[107] On May 23, 2022, it was announced that the Timberwolves had hired Tim Connelly, who previously served as the Denver Nuggets' president of basketball operations, as their president of basketball operations, taking over Gupta's job. He was reportedly signed to a 5-year, $40 million contract by the Timberwolves, that includes ownership equity.[108] On July 1, 2022, the Timberwolves traded Malik Beasley, Patrick Beverley, Jarred Vanderbilt, Leandro Bolmaro, and 2022 22nd pick Walker Kessler and 4 future first round draft picks for 3x NBA DPOY Rudy Gobert from the Utah Jazz.[109] The Timberwolves began the 2022–23 season with high expectations following the Gobert trade. They were dealt a blow on November 28, 2022, when Karl-Anthony Towns suffered a severe calf strain that cost him 52 games.[110] The injury pushed Anthony Edwards into a leadership role,[111] with the first-time All-Star guiding the team to a 42–40 finish and a play-in tournament berth. After falling to the Los Angeles Lakers in the first game, the Timberwolves secured the 8th seed with a 25-point win over the Oklahoma City Thunder.[112] They went on to lose to the first seed (and eventual NBA champion), the Denver Nuggets, in the first round in five games.[113] The 2023–24 season was their best since 2004, as they recorded 56 wins and landed the third seed in the Western Conference. They were the no. 1 defense in the league,[114] anchored by eventual DPOY winner Rudy Gobert and All-Defensive selection Jaden McDaniels. Anthony Edwards made his first All-NBA Team, Karl-Anthony Towns made his fourth All-Star Appearance, and fan favorite[115] Naz Reid was named Sixth Man of the Year.[116] On March 28, 2024, Glen Taylor announced that the sale of the team to prospective owners Marc Lore and Alex Rodriguez was off.[117] Lore and Rodriguez were expected to make their third and final payment installment to Taylor on March 27, 2024, raising their ownership interest from 40% to 80% in both the Timberwolves and Lynx, stemming from the April 2021 agreement to purchase the team.[118] However, Lore and Rodriguez's payment was not made by the deadline. It is unclear what exactly transpired leading to the deal falling through. On March 20, 2024, it was reported the Lore and Rodriguez lost the financial backing of the Carlyle Group that had previously pledged $300 million towards the final installment.[119] On March 21, 2024, it appeared as if Lore and Rodriguez had secured the backing of Blue Owl Capital to keep the sale on track.[120] Lore and Rodriguez state they filed the necessary paperwork for league approval prior to the March 27, 2024, payment deadline, which should have granted them a ninety-day extension to submit the funds to Taylor.[118] The parties met to mediate the dispute on May 1, 2024, but no agreement was reached.[118] On June 6, 2024, it was announced that Michael Bloomberg would join Rodriguez and Lore's ownership group.[121] In the first round of the 2024 playoffs, the Timberwolves swept the Phoenix Suns 4–0. It was their first series win since 2004, and the first series sweep in Minnesota men's professional sports history. The series saw Anthony Edwards ascend into rarefied air, becoming the 2nd player under 22 to record a 30/5/5 statline in multiple playoff games.[122] His performance spurred widespread comparisons to a young Michael Jordan,[123] even from Jordan himself.[124] In the conference semifinals, the Timberwolves squared off with the Denver Nuggets in a highly anticipated rematch of their 2023 first round series. After a nailbiter Game 1, the teams spent the next five games trading blowouts, leaving things 3–3 heading back to Denver for Game 7. Down 15 points at half, the Timberwolves led a miraculous comeback, winning the game 98–90 and securing a spot in the Western Conference finals — 20 years to the day of their last conference finals appearance.[125] Their run ended when they lost to the Dallas Mavericks in five games.[126] In the 2024 NBA Draft, they traded up to select Kentucky guard Rob Dillingham with the 8th pick.[127] During the 2024 offseason, the Timberwolves traded All-Star Karl-Anthony Towns to the New York Knicks for fellow big man All-Star Julius Randle, sharpshooter Donte DiVincenzo and a first round pick, ending an era for the Timberwolves.[128] Reigning Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert was signed to a 3-year, $110 million extension.[129] In their inaugural season in 1989, the Timberwolves (or \"Wolves\" as it said on their jerseys) debuted blue road uniforms with green lettering and numbers with white. Their home uniforms featured blue lettering and numbers with green outlining. The creation of both uniforms was led by head designer, Brian Mulligan.[130] There was going to be a green alternate jersey with blue lettering to go with the uniforms, but the idea was dropped. It would've followed a similar move the Dallas Mavericks took when they switched back to blue in the early 1990s, opting the Wolves a chance to use green for a jersey color instead.[130] The Timberwolves would resurrect the blue uniforms from this era during the 2009–10 season, as part of the franchise's 20th anniversary.[131] After drafting Kevin Garnett, the Timberwolves design team, under guidance from Brian Mulligan, changed their uniforms in 1996.[130] This time, the team added black and gray to the mix, and changing to a darker shade of blue.[130] The front of the jerseys then said the team's full name \"Timberwolves\" in a different font. For the 1997–98 season, a black alternate uniform was introduced. Those uniforms were used until the 2007–08 season.[130] The Timberwolves unveiled a new alternate logo on June 25, 2008.[132] The uniforms changed again in the 2008 off-season, this time with the road jerseys reading \"Minnesota\" and the home jerseys reading \"Wolves\", similar to that of the team's early years. Both uniforms had green, black, gray and blue on the pits and sides of the shorts.[133] The Timberwolves unveiled modified uniforms on August 16, 2010. The new uniforms eliminated the green from the collar, jersey and shorts, and the team also adjusted its number font again.[134] On November 23, 2010, the Timberwolves unveiled a black alternate uniform.[135][136] On November 27, 2013, the team changed their black road alternate jersey to a short sleeved jersey. The change came about due to the NBA's introduction of sleeved jerseys.[137] On April 11, 2017, the team unveiled a new logo to coincide with the massive roster turnaround of the past few years.[138][4] The Timberwolves revealed four new uniforms for the 2017–18 season as a part of a Nike-sponsored, league-wide initiative to redesign team uniforms.[139][140] All four uniforms used \"Wolves\" for the team name and included the Nike Swoosh and Fitbit logos. The Association Edition uniform, revealed on August 10, 2017, consisted of a white uniform with navy and blue stripes and lettering.[139][141] The Icon Edition uniform, which was revealed alongside its Association counterpart, has a navy body with white stripes and lettering.[139][141] On September 15, the Timberwolves revealed their Statement Edition uniform which is primarily neon green with navy stripes, navy lettering for the team and player names, and white text with a navy stroke for the jersey numbers.[142][143] The City Edition uniform, which is primarily gray with white lettering, was the last to be revealed on December 27.[144][145] On August 30, 2018, the Timberwolves unveiled their first \"Classic\" edition uniforms based on the black alternates used from 1997 to 2008.[146] They also unveiled a dark purple \"City\" uniform inspired by Prince's 1984 album Purple Rain, as well as a white \"Earned\" version that was exclusive only to the 16 teams that made the 2018 playoffs.[147][148] The Timberwolves' 2019–20 \"City\" uniform, which was unveiled on November 20, 2019, featured a sky blue base with white letters and trim that paid homage to the waters of the Mississippi River and the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area (the \"Twin Cities\").[149] For the 2020–21 season, the Timberwolves' \"City\" uniform paid homage to the North Star, featuring a midnight black base and aurora green trim. A green star is affixed below the neckline and above the abbreviation \"MINN\" in gray.[150] As part of the NBA's 75th anniversary, the Timberwolves' \"City\" uniform in the 2021–22 season mixed various elements from the franchise's previous uniforms. The royal blue base recalled the original 1989–1996 uniforms. The tree accents and lettering visually honored the 1996–2008 uniforms. The dark blue accents were inspired by the 2017–18 \"City\" uniforms. The original 1989–1996 logo was placed on the right leg, while the current logo was affixed on the left leg.[151] Beginning with the 2022–23 season, the Timberwolves unveiled a new \"Statement\" uniform, relegating neon green to trim color and featured a dark gray base. The full name \"Timberwolves\" was featured in front along with green-trimmed gray numbers.[152] Also during the season, a new \"City\" uniform was unveiled, featuring a white base, black letters and stripes, and rainbow palette to represent Minnesota's colorful community.[153] The \"City\" uniform in the 2023–24 season featured a mostly blue base with white lake water gradients; the design represented the fun summertime activities of Minnesota's citizens, from camping to fishing and swimming.[154] A special alternate court for the 2023 NBA in-season tournament was also unveiled to go with this uniform, featuring a light blue base with a lakewater blue strip in the middle.[155] Also for the season, the Timberwolves brought back the original 1989–1996 white uniform for its \"Classic\" edition, this to celebrate the franchise's 35th season. This was paired with a modernized version of the original court used at the Target Center.[156] The 2024–25 \"City\" uniform served as the inverse of last season's \"City\" uniform, this time with a mostly white base, ice blue gradients and black accents. The design was meant to capture Minnesota's winter landscape, with white and ice blue gradients representing the state's frozen lakes during winter.[157] Crunch the Wolf is the official mascot of the Minnesota Timberwolves, According to the team's official website, \"Crunch was born in the northernmost part of Minnesota’s wilderness areas. Deep in the forest, he grew with a love for something never before seen by others in his pack. Crunch's love for the game of basketball puzzled his mother and father, for he seemed to pick up the game on his own. With a makeshift basket built of pine-cones and birch bark, Crunch began to refine his game when he was still just a young pup. He learned the rules and techniques that make the game of basketball so great. He studied players and coaches alike, and soon would find himself on a journey like no other. Years later, when Minnesota’s expansion team, the Timberwolves, came to town, Crunch said goodbye to all he had known growing up in the woods, and migrated south to the Twin Cities where the team was to be based. No one is quite sure where Crunch lives, but legend has it he has a den somewhere deep inside the Target Center. He is lured out on game-days by the deafening howl made by Wolves fans. This howl creates an atmosphere in the Target Center that reminds Crunch of his days back in the forest, and yet keeps him here in Minneapolis, with the pursuit of helping the team to a victory.\"[158] List of the last five seasons completed by the Timberwolves. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Minnesota Timberwolves seasons. Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W–L% = Winning percentage Roster Last transaction: November 29, 2024 The Timberwolves hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.[159] This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. As of 2023, the Minnesota Timberwolves air all of their games on the iHeartRadio app, with select games airing on KFXN-FM 100.3 FM within the Twin Cities.[166] WCCO had been the team's radio home from 2011 until the end of the 2022–23 season.[167] Before that, KFAN/KFXN had been the Timberwolves' Twin Cities flagship station since the team's inception, except for a brief two-year hiatus to KLCI BOB 106.1 FM for the 2006–07 and 2007–08 seasons. Alan Horton has been the team's radio play-by-play announcer since the 2007–08 season.[168] The Timberwolves' games are broadcast primarily on Bally Sports North. But if the Minnesota Twins and Minnesota Wild occupy both Bally Sports North and Bally Sports North Extra, the game will be aired on WUCW as Bally Sports North Extra on The CW Twin Cities, and the Bally Sports app for viewers outside of WUCW's coverage area.[169] The broadcasters are Michael Grady and Jim Petersen.[170][171][172] 2022–2023",

He quickly joined the Nationals’ Dominican Academy and immediately began to immerse himself in English by using the Rosetta Stone language-learning software lessons. Soto initially practiced English for one hour a day, five days a week. After the Dominican Academy, Soto joined the Nationals’ Class A affiliate, the Hagerstown Suns. He met Suns catcher Tres Barrera, who was born in Texas to Mexican parents. Soto told Barrera that he only wanted the two of them to converse in English. Barrera told the Washington Post that he remembered how Soto would go to a McDonald’s near the Hagerstown ballpark every day to practice his English by ordering from the menu. When Soto was called up to the Nationals, he told manager Dave Martinez, “No Spanish, only English.” Soto himself also recalled the role that his mother played in his English lessons. “I remember her telling me that if I wanted to be a star, I had to know the language in the country I wanted to play in,” he reflected. “She was right.

                "title": "Juan Soto: Nationals outfielder, mastering English in addition to MLB",
                "content": "WASHINGTON — Juan Soto figures he was probably 12 years old when he returned home one day, after completing three levels of English courses, and told his mom he was done. He didn't want to learn the new language anymore. He didn't need to learn it anymore. \"She tells me if I want to be a baseball player, I have to learn,\" Soto recalled. \"I said, ‘No, I just have to play baseball.'\" But as Soto kept just playing baseball, his perspective changed. The Washington Nationals signed him to a contract in 2015 and gave him a $1.5-million signing bonus. They shipped the then-16-year-old Dominican outfielder to their academy in Boca Chica, a complex about an hour east of his hometown of Santo Domingo and a few miles from the beach. He started to think of English not as a chore, but as another skill to be mastered on his way to the big leagues. \"If you want to be a superstar,\" Soto told USA TODAY Sports, \"you’ve got to be ready in every spot.\" All things Nationals: Latest Washington Nationals news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more. Soto, now 20, has emerged as one of baseball's bright young stars over the past year – and one of the main reasons the Nationals felt comfortable letting Bryce Harper walk in free agency. But beyond his patience at the plate and ability to crush fastballs, he has most impressed teammates and staff with the dedication he's put into English – not just learning the language, but perfecting it. \"He was first to graduate at the (Dominican) academy, speaking English,\" Nationals manager Dave Martinez told USA TODAY Sports. \"He’s very adamant about fitting in and being a part of this culture, as well as back at home.\" According to statistics provided by MLB, more than 25 percent of players on Opening Day rosters this season hailed from Spanish-speaking countries, including more than 100 players from the Dominican Republic alone. Some players prefer to stick to their native tongues. Others work to pick up conversational English, to better communicate with their teammates and fans. Few pick it up as quickly as Soto has. \"It’s tough, definitely. It’s really tough,\" said Venezuelan-born pitcher Anibal Sanchez, who explained that he spoke zero English when he first joined the Boston Red Sox organization in 2001. \"When I came to the U.S., as soon as I got out of the plane, they asked me where I was from. And the answer was my name. The guy started laughing at me, but it is what it is at that point.\" Sanchez said he's taken online classes with a private teacher even in recent years to improve his English. For Soto, the process really started when he signed with the team less than four years ago – though he admits he did have a slight head start, thanks to his mom. When he arrived in Boca Chica, the staff gave Soto a log-in for Rosetta Stone and required him, like other prospects at the academy, to study English for at least one hour a day, five days per week. Soto met that daily requirement – and then some. \"Everybody goes to sleep and all this stuff, and I stayed awake and said ‘oh, let’s do some English,'\" Soto said. \"I started working. I (did) like two hours, one (more) hour every day. That’s why I finished really fast.\" The following year, when Soto graduated to the Gulf Coast League – the lowest rung of the minors – he used it as an opportunity to pick up more real-world experience. He spoke with his American teammates often, and found a safe learning space at a nearby McDonald's, where employees didn't judge him for saying the incorrect word or phrase. Soto became so articulate so quickly that by the time the Nationals called him up last spring, at 19, he was already able to conduct interviews in English. \"I didn’t even know we’ve got to talk with the media every day. So I was like… Wow,\" Soto said with a smile. \"I was a little nervous, but every word I said, I was like ‘Oh, I can do it in English.’ So I started doing it in English since the first day.\" Octavio Martinez, the Nationals' translator, flanked Soto during interviews with reporters when he was called up. And he's still on hand now, in case Soto misses a word or doesn't understand a question. But Martinez said he's rarely needed. \"I’m definitely very impressed – the fact that at such a young age, he’s able to comprehend it so well,\" Martinez said. \"I think the biggest thing is just his confidence, which shows on the field. He’s so confident. It’s the same thing with him talking to the media – he’s confident in what he’s going to say.\" Now, even two months into his second big-league season, Soto is the fourth-youngest player in the majors. He finished second in National League Rookie of the Year voting last season and has already racked up six home runs and 22 RBI this year, despite spending the past eight days on the injured list with back spasms. (He is eligible to return Saturday.) Soto said he's still working on his English every day, mostly by talking with teammates. The language has become important to him on the field, and even more so beyond it. He wants to be able to communicate with reporters in interviews, but also feel comfortable interacting with fans who might approach him at a restaurant and ask for an autograph. \"You’ve got to be comfortable to talk with them, and they’ve got to be comfortable with you talking, to ask everything they want,\" Soto explained. \"That’s why (stars) are stars. They’re good in every spot.\" Contact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad.",

                "content": "National Football League (1970–present) The Kansas City Chiefs are a professional American football team based in Kansas City, Missouri. The Chiefs compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) West division. The Chiefs started playing in 1959 as the Dallas Texans by businessman Lamar Hunt and was a charter member of the American Football League (AFL).[12] In 1963, the team moved to Kansas City,[13][14] and kept its current name.[15][16] The Chiefs joined the NFL as a result of the 1970 AFL–NFL merger; entering the 2024 season, the team is valued at over US$4.85 billion. After Hunt's death in 2006, his wife, Norma, and children became legal owners of the team. After Norma's death in 2023, the Hunt children inherited her stake in the franchise. Clark Hunt, one of the Hunts' children, has served as chairman and CEO since 2006 and is the ultimate authority over personnel decisions. He is also the team representative at league owner meetings. The Chiefs were victorious and won three AFL championships, in 1962, 1966, and 1969,[17][18] and were the second AFL team (after the New York Jets) to defeat an NFL team in a Super Bowl when they defeated the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl IV, which was the final game before the league merger went into full effect. The Chiefs were also the second team, after the Green Bay Packers (whom they played in Super Bowl I), to appear in more than one Super Bowl (and the first AFL team to do so) and the first to appear in the championship game in two different decades. Despite this post-season success, the team failed to find success in the playoffs for decades, including losing ten of eleven playoff games from 1993 to 2018, which included an eight-game losing streak. Since then, the Chiefs have risen to dynastic performance under head coach Andy Reid, quarterback Patrick Mahomes, tight end Travis Kelce, and defensive tackle Chris Jones, appearing in four Super Bowls since 2019 and being victorious in three: LIV, LVII, and LVIII.[19][20][21] In 1959, Lamar Hunt began discussions with other businessmen to establish a professional football league that would rival the National Football League.[17][22][23] Hunt's desire to secure a football team was heightened after watching the 1958 NFL Championship Game between the New York Giants and Baltimore Colts.[22][24] After unsuccessful attempts to purchase and relocate the NFL's Chicago Cardinals to his hometown of Dallas, Texas,[17][25] Hunt went to the NFL and asked to create an expansion franchise in Dallas. The NFL turned him down, so Hunt then established the American Football League and started his own team, the Dallas Texans, to begin play in 1960. Hunt hired a little-known assistant coach from the University of Miami football team, Hank Stram, to be the team's head coach[22] after the job offer was declined by Bud Wilkinson and Tom Landry.[22] After Stram was hired, Don Klosterman was hired as head scout, and was credited by many for bringing a wealth of talent to the Texans after luring it away from the NFL, often hiding players and using creative means to land them. The Texans shared the Cotton Bowl with the NFL's Dallas Cowboys for three seasons. The Texans were to have exclusive access to the stadium until the NFL put an expansion team, the Dallas Cowboys, there.[22] While the team averaged a league-best 24,500 at the Cotton Bowl, the Texans gained less attention due to the AFL's relatively lower profile compared to the NFL's.[22] In the franchise's first two seasons, the team managed only an 8–6 and 6–8 record, respectively.[26] In their third season, the Texans tallied an 11–3 record and a berth in the team's first American Football League Championship Game, against the Houston Oilers.[25][26] The game was broadcast nationally on ABC and the Texans defeated the Oilers 20–17 in double overtime.[25] The game lasted 77 minutes and 54 seconds, which, at the time, was the longest game in the history of professional American Football. It is still the longest championship game in American Football League history.[25] It turned out to be the last game the team would play as the Dallas Texans. Despite competing against a Cowboys team that managed only a 9–28–3 record in their first three seasons, Hunt decided that the Dallas–Fort Worth media market just couldn't sustain two professional football franchises.[25][27] He considered moving the Texans to either Atlanta or Miami for the 1963 season.[25] He was ultimately swayed by an offer from Kansas City Mayor Harold Roe Bartle.[25][27][28] Bartle promised to triple the franchise's season ticket sales and expand the seating capacity of Municipal Stadium to accommodate the team.[25][27][28] Hunt agreed to relocate the franchise to Kansas City on May 22, 1963,[13][14] and on May 26, the team was renamed the Kansas City Chiefs.[15][25][27][28] Hunt and head coach Hank Stram initially planned to retain the Texans name, but a fan contest determined the new \"Chiefs\" name in honor of Mayor Bartle's nickname that he acquired in his professional role as Scout Executive of the St. Joseph and Kansas City Boy Scout Councils, and founder of the Scouting Society, the Tribe of Mic-O-Say.[25][28] Despite the historical use of Native American features, it has been acknowledged that the team's naming was not a direct reference to Native Americans but only to Bartle's nickname \"Chief\".[29][30] Business Insider journalist Meredith Cash even stated in January 2020 that Bartle \"insisted on the team being named after himself\" and that \"Bartle was known as Chief Lone Bear within Mic-O-Say circles, and eventually the nickname \"Chief\" caught on among people throughout Kansas City.\"[31] The franchise became one of the strongest teams in the now thriving American Football League,[17] with the most playoff appearances for an AFL team (tied with the Oakland Raiders), and the most AFL Championships (three).[25] The team's dominance helped Lamar Hunt become a central figure in negotiations with NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle to agree on an AFL–NFL merger.[25][32] In the meetings between the two leagues, a merged league championship game was agreed to be played in January 1967 following the conclusion of the leagues' respective 1966 seasons. Hunt insisted on calling the game the \"Super Bowl\" after seeing his children playing with a popular toy at the time, a Super Ball.[25][32][33] While the first few games were designated the \"AFL–NFL World Championship Game\", the Super Bowl name became its officially licensed title in years to come.[34] The Chiefs cruised to an 11–2–1 record in 1966, and defeated the defending AFL Champion Buffalo Bills in the AFL Championship Game.[35] The Chiefs were invited to play the NFL's league champion Green Bay Packers in the first AFL–NFL World Championship Game. Kansas City and Green Bay played a close game for the first half, but Green Bay took control in the final two quarters, winning the game by a score of 35–10.[36] The Chiefs lost the game but gained the respect of several Packers opponents following the game.[37] The Chiefs' inter-league match-up with the Packers was not the last time that they would face an NFL opponent, especially on the championship stage.[25] The following August, Kansas City hosted the NFL's Chicago Bears in the 1967 preseason and won the game 66–24.[25] Despite losing to the division rival Oakland Raiders twice in the regular season in 1969, the two teams met for a third time in the AFL Championship Game, where Kansas City won 17–7.[26] Backup quarterback Mike Livingston led the team in a six-game winning streak after Len Dawson suffered a leg injury which kept him out of most of the season's games.[25] While getting plenty of help from the club's defense, Dawson returned from the injury and led the Chiefs to Super Bowl IV.[25] Against the NFL champion Minnesota Vikings,[17] who were favored by 12+1⁄2, the Chiefs dominated the game 23–7 to claim the team's first Super Bowl championship.[25] Dawson was named the game's Most Valuable Player after completing 12-of-17 passes for 142 yards and one touchdown, with 1 interception.[38] The following season, the Chiefs and the rest of the American Football League merged with the National Football League after the AFL–NFL merger became official.[25] The Chiefs were placed in the American Football Conference's West Division.[26] From 1960 to 1969, the Chiefs/Texans won 87 games, which is the most in the ten-year history of the AFL.[39] In 1970, the Chiefs went 7–5–2 and missed the playoffs.[40] The following season, the Chiefs tallied a 10–3–1 record and won the AFC West Division.[41] Head coach Hank Stram considered his 1971 Chiefs team as his best, but they failed to capture their championship dominance from 1969.[41] Most of the pieces of the team which won Super Bowl IV two years earlier were still in place for the 1971 season.[41] The Chiefs tied with the Miami Dolphins for the best record in the AFC, and both teams met in a Christmas Day playoff game which the Chiefs lost 27–24 in double overtime.[41] The Dolphins outlasted the Chiefs with a 37-yard field goal.[41] The game surpassed the 1962 AFL Championship Game as the longest ever at 82 minutes and 40 seconds.[41] The game was also the final football game at Kansas City's Municipal Stadium.[41] In 1972, the Chiefs moved into the newly constructed Arrowhead Stadium at the Truman Sports Complex outside of downtown Kansas City.[41] The team's first game at Arrowhead was against the St. Louis Cardinals, a preseason game that the Chiefs won 24–14.[41] Linebacker Willie Lanier and quarterback Len Dawson won the NFL Man of the Year Award in 1972 and 1973, respectively.[42] The Chiefs did not return to the post-season for the remainder of the 1970s, and the 1973 season was the team's last winning season for seven years.[41] Hank Stram was fired following a 5–9 season in 1974, and many of the Chiefs' future Hall of Fame players departed by the middle of the decade.[41] From 1975 to 1988, the Chiefs had become a team that rarely won, which provided Chiefs fans with nothing but futility.[43][44] Five head coaches struggled to achieve the same success as Stram, compiling an 81–121–1 record.[43] In 1980, Coach Marv Levy cut future Hall of Fame Kicker Jan Stenerud for little-known Nick Lowery, who would become the most accurate kicker in NFL history over the next fourteen years. In 1981, running back Joe Delaney rushed for 1,121 yards and was named the AFC Rookie of the Year.[45] The Chiefs finished the season with a 9–7 record and entered the 1982 season with optimism.[45] The NFL Players Association strike curbed the Chiefs' chances of returning to the postseason for the first time in over a decade.[45] The Chiefs tallied a 3–6 record[26] and in the off-season, Joe Delaney died while trying to save several children from drowning in a pond near his home in Louisiana.[46] The Chiefs drafted quarterback Todd Blackledge over future greats such as Jim Kelly and Dan Marino in the 1983 NFL draft.[47][48] Blackledge never started a full season for Kansas City while Kelly and Marino played Hall of Fame careers.[48] While the Chiefs struggled on offense in the 1980s, they had a strong defensive unit consisting of Pro Bowlers such as Bill Maas, Albert Lewis, Art Still and Deron Cherry.[45] John Mackovic took over head coaching duties for the 1983 season after Marv Levy was fired.[45] Over the next four seasons, Mackovic coached the Chiefs to a 30–34 record, but took the team to its first postseason appearance in 15 years in the 1986 NFL playoffs.[26] They lost to the New York Jets in the wild-card round.[45] Despite leading the Chiefs to only their third winning season and second playoff appearance since the merger, Mackovic was fired for what Hunt described as a lack of chemistry.[49] Frank Gansz served as head coach for the next two seasons, but won only eight of 31 games.[50][51] On December 19, 1988, owner Lamar Hunt hired Carl Peterson as the team's new president, general manager, and chief executive officer. Peterson fired head coach Frank Gansz two weeks after taking over and hired Marty Schottenheimer as the club's seventh head coach.[45] In the 1988 and 1989 NFL Drafts, the Chiefs selected both defensive end Neil Smith and linebacker Derrick Thomas, respectively.[45][53] The defense that Thomas and Smith anchored in their seven seasons together was a big reason why the Chiefs reached the postseason in six straight years.[54] In Schottenheimer's ten-season tenure as head coach, the Chiefs became a perennial playoff contender, featuring offensive players including Steve DeBerg, Christian Okoye, Stephone Paige and Barry Word, a strong defense, anchored by Thomas, Smith, Albert Lewis and Deron Cherry, and on special teams, Nick Lowery, who was then the most accurate kicker in NFL History.[17] The team recorded a 101–58–1 record, and clinched seven playoff berths.[55] The Chiefs' 1993 season was the franchise's most successful in 22 years.[53] With newly acquired quarterback Joe Montana and running back Marcus Allen, two former Super Bowl champions and Most Valuable Player Award winners, the Chiefs further strengthened their position in the NFL.[53] The 11–5 Chiefs defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers and Houston Oilers on their way to the franchise's first AFC Championship Game appearance against the Buffalo Bills.[53] The Chiefs were overwhelmed by the Bills and lost the game by a score of 30–13.[53] The Chiefs' victory on January 16, 1994, against the Oilers remained the franchise's last post-season victory for 22 years until their 30–0 victory over the Houston Texans on January 9, 2016.[56] In the 1995 NFL playoffs, the 13–3 Chiefs hosted the Indianapolis Colts in a cold, damp late afternoon game at Arrowhead Stadium.[26][53] Kansas City lost the game 10–7 against the underdog Colts, after kicker Lin Elliot missed three field-goal attempts and quarterback Steve Bono threw three interceptions.[53] The Chiefs selected tight end Tony Gonzalez with the 13th overall selection in the 1997 NFL draft, a move which some considered to be a gamble being that Gonzalez was primarily a basketball player at California. During a 1997 season full of injuries to starting quarterback Elvis Grbac, backup quarterback Rich Gannon took the reins of the Chiefs' offense as the team headed to another 13–3 season.[26][53] Head coach Marty Schottenheimer chose Grbac to start the playoff game against the Denver Broncos despite Gannon's successes in previous weeks.[53] Grbac's production in the game was lacking, and the Chiefs lost to the Broncos 14–10.[53] Denver went on to capture their fifth AFC Championship by defeating Pittsburgh, and then defeated the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XXXII. Coach Schottenheimer announced his resignation from the Chiefs following the 1998 season.[57] Following Schottenheimer's resignation, defensive coordinator Gunther Cunningham took over coaching duties for the next two seasons, compiling a 16–16 record.[53] By the end of the Chiefs' decade of regular-season dominance, Gannon had signed with the Oakland Raiders, Neil Smith signed with the Denver Broncos, and Derrick Thomas was paralyzed in a car accident on January 23, 2000.[53] Thomas died from complications of his injury weeks later.[53] After allegedly reading online that he would be relieved of duties, head coach Gunther Cunningham was fired.[58][59] Looking to change the Chiefs' game plan which relied on a tough defensive strategy for the past decade, Carl Peterson contacted Dick Vermeil about the Chiefs' head coaching vacancy for the 2001 season.[58] Vermeil previously led the St. Louis Rams to a victory in Super Bowl XXXIV.[59] Vermeil was hired on January 12.[60] The Chiefs then traded a first-round draft pick in the 2001 NFL draft to St. Louis for quarterback Trent Green and signed free agent running back Priest Holmes to be the team's cornerstones on offense.[61][62] In Vermeil's first season with the Chiefs, he led the team to a 6–10 record.[63] The team improved to a 8–8 record in 2002 but still missed the postseason.[64] In 2003, Kansas City began the season with nine consecutive victories, a franchise record.[65] They finished the season with a 13–3 record and the team's offense led the NFL in several categories under the direction of USA Today's Offensive Coach of the Year honoree, Al Saunders.[59] Running back Priest Holmes surpassed Marshall Faulk's single-season touchdown record by scoring his 27th rushing touchdown against the Chicago Bears in the team's regular-season finale.[59][66] The team clinched the second seed in the 2003 NFL playoffs and hosted the Indianapolis Colts in the AFC Divisional Playoffs.[67] In a game where neither team punted, the Chiefs lost the shoot-out 38–31.[68] It was the third time in nine seasons that the Chiefs went 8–0 at home in the regular season, only to lose their post-season opener at Arrowhead. After a disappointing 7–9 record in 2004, the 2005 Chiefs finished with a 10–6 record but no playoff berth.[69][70] They were the fourth team since 1990 to miss the playoffs with a 10–6 record.[59] Running back Larry Johnson started in place of the injured Priest Holmes and rushed for 1,750 yards in only nine starts.[71] Prior to the Chiefs' final game of the season, head coach Dick Vermeil announced his retirement.[72] The Chiefs won the game 37–3 over the playoff-bound Cincinnati Bengals.[73] Within two weeks of Vermeil's retirement, the Chiefs returned to their defensive roots with the selection of its next head coach.[59] The team introduced Herm Edwards, a former Chiefs scout and head coach of the New York Jets, as the team's tenth head coach after trading a fourth-round selection in the 2006 NFL draft to the Jets.[74] Quarterback Trent Green suffered a severe concussion in the team's season opener to the Cincinnati Bengals which left him out of play for eight weeks.[75] Backup quarterback Damon Huard took over in Green's absence and led the Chiefs to a 5–3 record.[76] Kansas City was awarded a Thanksgiving Day game against the Denver Broncos in response to owner Lamar Hunt's lobbying for a third Thanksgiving Day game.[59] The Chiefs defeated the Broncos 19–10 in the first Thanksgiving Day game in Kansas City since 1969.[59] Hunt was hospitalized at the time of the game and died weeks later on December 13 due to complications of prostate cancer.[32][59] The Chiefs honored their owner for the remainder of the season, as did the rest of the league.[59] Trent Green returned in the middle of the season, but struggled in the final stretch,[59] and running back Larry Johnson set an NFL record with 416 carries in a season.[77] Kansas City managed to clinch their first playoff berth in three seasons with a 9–7 record and a bizarre sequence of six losses from other AFC teams on New Year's Eve, culminating with a Broncos loss to the 49ers.[59] The Indianapolis Colts hosted the Chiefs in the Wild Card playoffs and defeated Kansas City 23–8.[78] In 2007, Trent Green was traded to the Miami Dolphins[79] leaving the door open for either Damon Huard or Brodie Croyle to become the new starting quarterback.[59] After starting the season with a 4–3 record, the Chiefs lost the remaining nine games when running back Larry Johnson suffered a season-ending foot injury and the quarterback position lacked stability with Huard and Croyle.[59] Despite the team's 4–12 record, tight end Tony Gonzalez broke Shannon Sharpe's NFL record for touchdowns at the position (63) and defensive end Jared Allen led the NFL in quarterback sacks with 15.5.[80][81] The Chiefs began their 2008 season with the youngest team in the NFL.[82] The starting lineup had an average of 25.5 years of age.[82] By releasing several veteran players such as cornerback Ty Law and wide receiver Eddie Kennison and trading defensive end Jared Allen,[83] the Chiefs began a youth movement.[82][84] The Chiefs had a league-high thirteen selections in the 2008 NFL draft and chose defensive tackle Glenn Dorsey and offensive lineman Branden Albert in the first round. Analysts quickly called Kansas City's selections as the best of the entire draft.[83][85][86][87] Entering the season, the Chiefs were unsure if injury-prone quarterback Brodie Croyle, who was the incumbent starter, could be their quarterback in the long-term.[87] Croyle was injured in the team's first game of the season and Damon Huard started in Croyle's absence.[88] Tyler Thigpen become the third Chiefs starting quarterback in as many games for a start against the Atlanta Falcons.[89][90] After a poor performance by Thigpen, in which he threw three interceptions against the Falcons defense,[90] Huard was retained as the starting quarterback.[91] The Chiefs struggled off the field as much as on as tight end Tony Gonzalez demanded a trade and running back Larry Johnson was involved in legal trouble.[92][93][94][95] Croyle returned for the Chiefs' game against the Tennessee Titans, but both he and Damon Huard suffered season-ending injuries in the game.[96] The Chiefs reorganized their offense to a new spread offense game plan focused around Tyler Thigpen.[84][88][97][98] The Chiefs' new offense was implemented to help Thigpen play to the best of his abilities and also following the absence of Larry Johnson, who was suspended for his off-field conduct.[93][97][98][99] The Chiefs made a huge gamble by using the spread offense, as most in the NFL believe that it cannot work in professional football, and also head coach Herm Edwards was traditionally in favor of more conservative, run-oriented game plans.[98] The 2008 season ended with a franchise worst 2–14 record, where the team suffered historic blowout defeats nearly week-in and week-out,[26][90][100] a 34–0 shut-out to the Carolina Panthers,[101] and allowed a franchise-high 54 points against the Buffalo Bills.[102] The team's general manager, chief executive officer, and team president Carl Peterson resigned at the end of the season,[103] and former New England Patriots vice president of player personnel Scott Pioli was hired as his replacement for 2009.[104] On January 23, 2009, Herm Edwards was fired as head coach,[105][106] and two weeks later Todd Haley signed a four-year contract to become Edwards' successor.[107][108] Haley had a background with Pioli, which made him an attractive hire for Pioli's first coach in Kansas City. In April 2009, Tony Gonzalez was traded to the Atlanta Falcons after failed trade attempts over the previous two seasons.[109] Notably, head coach Todd Haley fired offensive coordinator Chan Gailey just weeks before the start of the 2009 season and chose to take on the coordinator duties himself. Throughout 2009 the Chiefs acquired veterans to supplement the Chiefs' young talent including Matt Cassel, Mike Vrabel, Bobby Engram, Mike Brown, Chris Chambers, and Andy Alleman.[110][111][112] The team finished with a 4–12 record, just a two-game improvement upon their record from the 2008 season. For the 2010 season, the Chiefs made significant hires for their coaching staff, bringing on former Patriots assistant coaches Charlie Weis and Romeo Crennel to coach the offense and defense, respectively.[113] The coaching additions proved to be very successful, as the Chiefs would go on to secure their first AFC West title since 2003. Their ten victories in the 2010 season combined for as many as the team had won in their previous three seasons combined.[114] On January 9, 2011, the Chiefs lost their home Wild Card playoff game to the Baltimore Ravens 30–7.[115] Six players were chosen for the Pro Bowl: Dwayne Bowe, Jamaal Charles, Brian Waters, Tamba Hali, Matt Cassel, and rookie safety Eric Berry. Jamaal Charles won the FEDEX ground player of the year award and Dwayne Bowe led the NFL in touchdown receptions.[116] For their first pick in the 2011 NFL draft, the team selected Jon Baldwin.[117] After a poor start, Haley was relieved of duties as head coach on December 12. Clark Hunt made note of \"bright spots at different points this season,\" but felt that overall the Chiefs were not progressing.[118] The highest point of the 2011 season was an upset win against the Packers, who at that time, were undefeated with a 13–0 record.[119] Defensive coordinator Romeo Crennel would be named the team's interim head coach for the remaining three games of the season, including the aforementioned Packers game.[120] On January 9, 2012, Crennel was named the 11th full-time head coach in Chiefs history.[121] The 2012 Chiefs became the first team since the 1929 Buffalo Bisons to not lead in regulation through any of their first nine games.[122] The Chiefs tied their franchise-worst record of 2–14 and clinched the No. 1 overall pick in the 2013 NFL draft.[123] It is the first time since the merger they have held the first overall pick.[124] Following the 2012 season, the Chiefs fired head coach Romeo Crennel and general manager Scott Pioli.[125][126] Former Philadelphia Eagles head coach Andy Reid was brought in as head coach to work with new general manager John Dorsey, a former Green Bay Packers head scout.[127][128] The Chiefs acquired quarterback Alex Smith from the San Francisco 49ers for the Chiefs' second-round pick, 34th overall, in the 2013 draft and a conditional pick in the 2014 draft.[129] Matt Cassel was released shortly after.[130] The Chiefs selected Eric Fisher with the first overall pick of the 2013 NFL draft.[131] In 2013, the Chiefs started 9–0 for the second time in team history.[132] The team finished with a 11–5 record and made the playoffs.[133] They led in their wildcard game against the Indianapolis Colts 38–10 shortly after halftime, but collapsed late and lost 45–44.[134] In 2014, the Chiefs attempted to make the playoffs for the second straight season for the first time since 1995, finishing 9–7 and getting eliminated in Week 17.[135] After a promising win for the Chiefs against Houston in Week 1, Kansas City went on a five-game losing streak culminating in a 16–10 loss to Minnesota and the loss of Jamaal Charles to a torn ACL.[136] They made one of the most improbable season comebacks in the NFL and won ten straight to improve their record from 1–5 to 11–5. The team clinched a playoff berth after a 17–13 win over Cleveland in Week 16 to become only the second post-merger NFL team to make the playoffs following a 1–5 start.[137] The streak achieved by the Chiefs broke a franchise record for nine straight (2003, 2013) and second nine plus game win streak under Reid. After a Week 17 win over Oakland 23–17, the Chiefs achieved their longest winning streak in franchise history at ten games. They qualified for the playoffs, playing in the 2015 AFC Wild-Card playoff game, held at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas on January 9, 2016. The Chiefs defeated the Houston Texans 30–0 to earn their first NFL playoff win in 23 seasons, dating back to the 1993–94 NFL playoffs, a win that also came in Houston. The Chiefs' Wild-Card playoff victory ended what was at the time the third-longest drought in the NFL, and it also ended a then NFL record eight-game playoff losing streak.[138] Riddled with injuries, they were defeated by the New England Patriots 27–20 in the AFC Divisional Round.[139] The Chiefs first game of the 2016 season was against their division rival, the San Diego Chargers. After facing a 24–3 deficit with six minutes left in the 3rd quarter, the Chiefs engineered a 33–27 comeback win ending with a two-yard touchdown run by Alex Smith in overtime to give the Chiefs their largest regular season comeback to start the season at 1–0.[140] On Christmas Day, the Chiefs defeated the Denver Broncos 33–10 to give Kansas City their tenth straight win against divisional opponents. On January 1, 2017, the Chiefs clinched the AFC West and the second seed going into the playoffs that year, where they fell to the Pittsburgh Steelers 18–16 in the divisional round as Chris Boswell hit six field goals.[141] The Chiefs finished the 2017 season with a 10–6 record, and won the AFC West.[142] This was the first time in Chiefs history that they won the AFC West in back-to-back years.[143] In the Wild Card round, the Chiefs lost a tight game to the Tennessee Titans 22–21, allowing Derrick Henry to rush for 156 yards. The loss extended their NFL record for most consecutive home playoff losses to six.[144] The game marked the end of Alex Smith's five-year tenure with the Chiefs, as he was traded to the Washington Redskins a few weeks later.[145] Patrick Mahomes made his NFL debut and first career start in the December 31, 2017, game against the Denver Broncos. The Chiefs won the game 27–24, with Mahomes going 22 for 35 with 284 yards and one interception.[146] The Chiefs began the 2018 season with first-year starter Mahomes as their quarterback and finished the regular season with a record of 12–4, clinching the AFC West for the third year in a row and the AFC's top seed. This included victories over division rivals Los Angeles Chargers, Oakland Raiders and Denver Broncos (twice), along with important conference victories over the Pittsburgh Steelers, Cincinnati Bengals, and Jacksonville Jaguars. Their first loss of the season came at the hands of the New England Patriots with a last-second field goal.[147] Their second loss of the season came against the Los Angeles Rams with a final score of 51–54, in which the Kansas City Chiefs made history by becoming the first NFL team to lose a game after scoring more than 50 points.[148] Mahomes finished the season with 5,097 yards and 50 touchdowns, both team records.[149] He became the 11th quarterback to throw for 5,000 yards and the third to throw for 50 touchdowns.[150] He joined Peyton Manning as only the 2nd player in NFL history to throw for 5,000 yards and 50 touchdowns.[151] For his performance during the season, he was named AP NFL MVP, the first Chief to ever win the award.[152] In the AFC Divisional round on January 12, 2019, the Chiefs defeated the Indianapolis Colts 31–13 to move on to the AFC Championship Game.[153] This marked the Chiefs' first playoff win in Arrowhead Stadium in 25 years.[154] This also enabled the Chiefs to host the AFC Championship Game for the first time ever.[155] The next week, Kansas City's bid for its first Super Bowl berth in 49 years ended with a 37–31 overtime loss to the New England Patriots.[156] The Chiefs finished the 2019 regular season with a 12–4 record, winning the AFC West division title for the fourth straight year, and clinched the AFC's second seed behind the Baltimore Ravens.[157] The Chiefs defeated the Houston Texans 51–31 in the AFC Divisional Game after falling behind 24–0 at the start of the second quarter with Mahomes throwing for five touchdowns.[158] The Chiefs hosted their second AFC Championship game in consecutive years facing the sixth-seed Tennessee Titans. The Chiefs then defeated the Titans 35–24 and advanced to Super Bowl LIV.[159] This marked their first Super Bowl appearance in 50 years, since Super Bowl IV.[160] On February 2, 2020, in Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, the Chiefs played against the NFC's top seed, the San Francisco 49ers. Following halftime when both teams were tied at ten points, Mahomes threw 2 interceptions in back to back drives in the 3rd and 4th quarters, resulting in the 49ers having a 20–10 lead with under 12 minutes remaining in the game. Sparked by a 44-yard completion to Tyreek Hill on 3rd and 15, the Chiefs scored touchdowns on their next two possessions, with Mahomes throwing touchdowns to Travis Kelce and Damien Williams.[161] With a 24–20 lead with under two minutes remaining, Williams had a 38-yard touchdown run to effectively seal the game for the Chiefs. This marked the first time in NFL postseason history that a team faced ten point deficits in three straight games and won all three by double-digit margins. Mahomes won the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award, ending the Chiefs' Super Bowl drought dating back to the AFL-NFL Merger.[162] On July 6, 2020, Mahomes signed a record ten–year, $503 million contract extension keeping him under contract until the conclusion of the 2031 season. The contract is the largest ever signed in North American sports, more than tripling the value of the previous largest contract signed (although said contract was for a shorter 5 years, signed by Matt Ryan of the Atlanta Falcons).[163] With their week 14 victory over the Miami Dolphins, the Chiefs clinched their fifth consecutive division title. The victory also gave the Chiefs their first 12–1 record in franchise history. They would later win 14 games for the first time in franchise history. In the playoffs they defeated the Cleveland Browns and Buffalo Bills to win the AFC Championship for the second consecutive year.[164][165] The Chiefs would face the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Super Bowl LV at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, ultimately losing 9–31, failing to score a touchdown in the game.[166] In their 2021 season, the Chiefs beat the Pittsburgh Steelers 36–10, earning the team's sixth straight AFC West title on December 26, 2021.[167] The Chiefs began their playoff slate with a win against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the Wild Card round, and advanced to play the Buffalo Bills in the divisional round. Their 42–36 victory over Buffalo came in a game sports commentators and analysts dubbed as one of the greatest modern day NFL playoff games.[168][169][170][171][172][173] Despite being the first team to host the AFC Championship game for four consecutive seasons, the team finished the season losing 24–27 in overtime to the Cincinnati Bengals. The Chiefs began their 2022 season by trading Tyreek Hill to the Miami Dolphins,[174] and instead opting to stock up on picks in the 2022 NFL draft. They finished the season with a 14–3 regular season record, with losses coming from the Colts, Bills, and Bengals. All three losses were by margins of less than four points. The Chiefs won their seventh consecutive AFC West division championship, and secured the #1 seed in the AFC playoffs.[175] The team hosted their fifth consecutive AFC Championship Game,[176] and second consecutive against the Cincinnati Bengals, winning 23–20 on a game-winning field goal from Harrison Butker.[177] In Super Bowl LVII, the Chiefs defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 38–35 again on a field goal from Butker.[178] With the victory, Mahomes became the first player since Kurt Warner in 1999 to win both the NFL MVP Award and Super Bowl MVP Award in the same season.[179] Head coach Andy Reid won his second Super Bowl championship over the Eagles, the team he had previously led to a Super Bowl appearance.[180] Entering the 2023 season as defending champions, the Chiefs failed to improve on their 14–3 record from the previous season, despite this they secured their eleventh consecutive winning season and became division champions for the eighth consecutive season.[181][182][183] Their overall record was 11–6, their least successful record under quarterback Patrick Mahomes. In the playoffs, the Chiefs defeated the Miami Dolphins 26–7 in the wildcard round in frigid weather. In the divisional round, the team held on to a narrow 27–24 win over the Buffalo Bills on the road. This was the Chiefs third playoff win in four years over the Bills. They made their sixth consecutive AFC Championship Game appearance, but their first on the road, defeating the Baltimore Ravens 17–10 to advance to their fourth Super Bowl in five years. In a rematch of Super Bowl LIV, the Chiefs overtime defeat of the San Francisco 49ers 25–22 in Super Bowl LVIII moved the franchise to four Super Bowl titles, becoming the seventh franchise to accomplish that number. This was only the second overtime game in Super Bowl history.[184] This marked the first back-to-back Super Bowl wins since Super Bowl XXXIX, making it three Super Bowl wins in five years and cementing them as a dynasty.[185][186] The Chiefs have won four Super Bowl Championships and three AFL Championships – the latter of which were won twice as the Kansas City Chiefs and once under their original name, the Dallas Texans.[187][188] When the Texans began playing in 1960, the team's logo consisted of the state of Texas in white with a yellow star marking the location of the city of Dallas. Originally, Hunt chose Columbia blue and orange for the Texans' uniforms, but Bud Adams chose Columbia blue and scarlet for his Houston Oilers franchise.[5] Hunt reverted to red and gold for the Texans' uniforms, which even after the team relocated to Kansas City, remain as the franchise's colors to this day.[5] The state of Texas on the team's helmet was replaced by an arrowhead design originally sketched by Lamar Hunt on a napkin.[5] Hunt's inspiration for the interlocking \"KC\" design was the \"SF\" inside of an oval on the San Francisco 49ers helmets.[5] Unlike the 49ers' logo, Kansas City's overlapping initials appear inside a white arrowhead instead of an oval and are surrounded by a thin black outline.[5] From 1960 to 1973, the Chiefs had grey facemask bars on their helmets, but changed to white facemasks in 1974, making them one of the first teams (alongside the San Diego Chargers, who introduced a yellow facemask that same year) in the NFL to use a non-gray facemask.[5] The Chiefs' uniform design has essentially remained the same throughout the club's history with only four minor changes occurring.[5] It consists of a red helmet, and either red or white jerseys with the opposite color numbers and names.[5] White pants were used with both jerseys from 1960 to 1967, and 1989 to 1999.[5] Beginning in 2009, during the Pioli/Haley era, the team has alternated between white and red pants for road games during the season. Prior to September 15, 2013, the Chiefs always wore white pants with their red jerseys. The Chiefs do not have an official alternate jersey, although unofficial alternate jerseys are sold for retail. The Chiefs wore their white jerseys with white pants at home for the 2006 season opener against the Cincinnati Bengals. The logic behind the uniform selection that day was that the Bengals would have to wear their black uniform on a day when hot temperatures were forecast.[189] In 2007, the Kansas City Chiefs honored Lamar Hunt and the AFL with a special patch.[190] It features the AFL's logo from the 1960s with Hunt's \"LH\" initials inside the football.[190] In 2008, the patch became permanently affixed to the left chest of both Kansas City's home and away jerseys.[190] In select games for the 2009 season, the Chiefs, as well as the other founding teams of the American Football League, wore a \"throwback\" uniform to celebrate the AFL's 50th anniversary.[191] For the first time in team history, the Chiefs wore red jerseys with red pants, forming an all-red combo in their home opener against the Dallas Cowboys on September 15, 2013.[192] The all-red uniform is now an official uniform combination and has been used multiple times since. It is commonly used for prime-time games at home. The all-red look also served as the basis for the Chiefs' Color Rush design. Arrowhead Stadium has been the Chiefs' home field since 1972 and has a capacity of 76,416,[193] which makes it the fifth-largest stadium in the NFL. The stadium underwent a $375 million renovation, completed in mid-2010, which included new luxury boxes, wider concourses and enhanced amenities.[194][104] The stadium renovation was paid for by $250 million in taxpayer money and $125 million from the Hunt Family.[108] The stadium cost $53 million to build in 1972, and an average ticket in 2009 costs $81.[194] Aramark serves as the stadium's concession provider and T-Mobile, Anheuser-Busch and Coca-Cola are major corporate sponsors.[194] Dating back to the Chiefs' home opener in 1991 to mid-2009, the Chiefs had 155 consecutive sellout games.[194] The streak ended with the final home game of the 2009 season against the Cleveland Browns, resulting in the first local TV blackout in over 19 years.[195] Arrowhead has been called one of the world's finest stadiums[17] and has long held a reputation for being one of the toughest and loudest outdoor stadiums for opposing players to play in.[104][196][197][198] All noise is directly attributed to its fans[199] and was once measured at 116 decibels by the Acoustical Design Group of Mission, Kansas.[200] By way of comparison, take-off of aircraft may lead to a sound level of 106 decibels at the ground.[200] Sports Illustrated named Arrowhead Stadium the \"toughest place to play\" for opposing teams in 2005.[201] The tailgate party environment outside the stadium on gameday has been compared to a \"college football\" atmosphere.[202] Arrowhead Stadium features frequent fly-overs from a B-2 Spirit stealth bomber from nearby Whiteman Air Force Base. Since the 1994 NFL season, the stadium has had a natural grass playing surface.[203] From 1972 to 1993, the stadium had an artificial AstroTurf surface.[203] During the game against the Oakland Raiders on October 13, 2013, Arrowhead Stadium once again became the loudest stadium in the world when the fans set the Guinness Book of World Records record for loudest crowd in an outdoor stadium (137.5 dB), breaking the record set by the Seattle Seahawks just four weeks prior. A few weeks after, Seattle re-gained the record by reaching a noise level of 137.6 decibels.[204][205] Chiefs fans have reclaimed the record once again on September 29, 2014, on ESPN's Monday Night Football against the New England Patriots, the fans recorded a sound reading of 142.2 decibels.[206] The stadium has been officially named GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium (pronounced G.E.H.A.) since 2021. The stadium was renamed after GEHA signed a naming rights deal with the Chiefs.[207] When the franchise was based in Dallas, the team conducted their inaugural training camp at the New Mexico Military Institute in Roswell, New Mexico.[25] They moved camp to Southern Methodist University, owner Lamar Hunt's alma mater, for 1961 and continued to practice there until 1965.[25] From 1966 to 1971, the Chiefs practiced in Swope Park in Kansas City,[208] and from 1972 to 1991 held camp at William Jewell College in Clay County, Missouri–where Lamar Hunt had extensive business dealings including Worlds of Fun, Oceans of Fun and SubTropolis.[53] From 1992 to 2009 the Chiefs conducted summer training camp at the University of Wisconsin–River Falls in River Falls, Wisconsin.[209] The Chiefs' 2007 training camp was documented in the HBO/NFL Films documentary reality television series, Hard Knocks.[210] Following the passage of a $25 million state tax credit proposal, the Chiefs moved their training camp to Missouri Western State University in St. Joseph, Missouri, in 2010.[211] The bulk of the tax credits went for improvements to Arrowhead Stadium with $10 million applied to the move to Missouri Western.[212] A climate-controlled, 120-yard NFL regulation grass indoor field, and office space for the Chiefs was constructed at Missouri Western adjacent to the school's Spratt Stadium before the 2010 season.[213] Outside of training camp and during the regular season, the Chiefs conduct practices at their own training facility nearby Arrowhead Stadium. The facility is located near the Raytown Road entrance to the Truman Sports Complex just east of Interstate 435 and features three outdoor fields (two grass and one artificial turf) as well as an indoor facility with its own full-size field. The rivalry between the Chiefs and the Las Vegas Raiders is considered as one of the NFL's most bitter, extending back into the infancy of the AFL.[214] Most notably during the era; both the Chiefs and Raiders appeared in the first two Super Bowl games.[215][216][217] Since the AFL was established in 1960, the Chiefs and Raiders have shared the same division, first being the AFL Western Conference, and since the AFL–NFL merger, the AFC West. The Chiefs lead the regular season series 73–55–2 as of the end of the 2023 season, including a 2–1 playoff record against Las Vegas.[218] A historic divisional battle for the Chiefs; the rivalry with the Los Angeles Chargers reignited during the 2020s as matchups would feature an offensive battle between Patrick Mahomes and Chargers' pro-bowl quarterback Justin Herbert.[219] The Chiefs lead 69–58–1 as of the end of the 2023 season,[220] but the Chargers won 17–0 in the only playoff meeting between the two teams, a 1992 AFC wild card game.[221] Chiefs lead 72–56 as of the 2023 season, which included a run of 16 straight wins,[222] but the Broncos won the only playoff game between the two teams, a 1997 AFC Divisional game.[223][224] The series originated during the American Football League's inaugural season in 1960, as both the Kansas City Chiefs, then known as the Dallas Texans, and Buffalo Bills were charter teams in the league.[225] Despite being in two different divisions since their founding in 1960, the Bills and Chiefs have had many notable moments in NFL postseason history, most notably the 1966 AFL Championship Game, the 2021 AFC Divisional playoff game (known especially for the infamous '13 Seconds'), and the 2024 AFC Divisional playoff game (known as 'Wide Right II'). Since 2020, the rivalry has redeveloped as both teams consistently contended for the AFC title. A rivalry has also developed between Bills quarterback Josh Allen and Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, with many comparing it to the former rivalry between Tom Brady and Peyton Manning.[226] As of 2023, Buffalo leads the series 29–25–1, but Kansas City leads the playoff series 4–2. Of the six playoff meetings the teams have contested, three were AFL/AFC championship games.[227] A relatively new rivalry for the Chiefs has formed in the 2020s with the Cincinnati Bengals. Prior to 2021, the rivalry was nonexistent. By 2021 though, the Bengals became a rising team in the AFC with the arrival of a healthy top tier quarterback in Joe Burrow, the #1 pick in the 2020 NFL draft, who could go toe to toe with Patrick Mahomes.[228] The Bengals beat the Chiefs in the 2021 regular season in Cincinnati 34–31, and then followed that up with a victory in that year's AFC Championship Game at Arrowhead, a game in which the Cincinnati defense shut the Kansas City offense down in the second half and kicker Evan McPherson hit a game winning field goal in overtime to advance to Super Bowl LVI. In 2022, the Chiefs and Bengals again met in the regular season, with the Bengals prevailing 27–24 and sealing the game off of a rare Travis Kelce fumble. The Chiefs again met the Bengals in the AFC Championship game that season. The Chiefs won the game on a walk off field goal and advanced to Super Bowl LVII thanks to Bengals defensive end Joseph Ossai hitting Patrick Mahomes out of bounds when Mahomes was scrambling for a first down, leading to an unnecessary roughness penalty.[229] The two teams met again in 2023, but did not face Joe Burrow due to Burrow suffering a season ending wrist injury earlier in the season. To date, the Joe Burrow led Bengals are the only AFC team to have a winning record against the Chiefs since Patrick Mahomes became their starting quarterback. As of 2023, the Bengals lead the all-time series 18–16.[230] When St. Louis, Missouri had NFL teams, namely the Cardinals and later the Rams, a cross-state rivalry existed with the Chiefs; with a trophy being awarded to the winner of each game. The series was active with the Cardinals from 1960 to 1988 prior to their relocation to Arizona. The series found new life from 1995 to 2015 after the Rams played in St. Louis for a 20-year tenure. Despite this, the series ended permanently following the Rams' relocation back to Los Angeles in 2016. Though, following the Rams' return to Los Angeles; the two teams would play each other during the 2018 season in a historic matchup which set the record for the third-highest scoring game of all time,[231] hailed by many as one of the greatest games in league history.[232][233] As of the 2023 season, the Chiefs lead the all-time series 8–5.[234] The Chiefs' first mascot was Warpaint, a nickname given to several breeds of pinto horse. Warpaint served as the team's mascot from 1963 to 1988.[24][235][236] The first Warpaint (born in 1955, died in 1992) was ridden bareback by rider Bob Johnson who wore a full Native American headdress.[24][235] Warpaint circled the field at the beginning of each Chiefs home game and performed victory laps following each Chiefs touchdown.[24][235] On September 20, 2009, a new Warpaint horse was unveiled at the Chiefs' home opener.[237] Warpaint was ridden by a cheerleader in its return.[238] The Chiefs again retired Warpaint in 2021 as a part of their commitment to stop the use of Native American imagery.[239] In the mid-1980s, the Chiefs featured a short-lived unnamed \"Indian man\" mascot which was later scrapped in 1988.[235] Since 1989 the cartoon-like K. C. Wolf, portrayed by Dan Meers in a wolf costume, has served as the team's mascot.[24][240] The mascot was named after the Chiefs' \"Wolfpack\", a group of rabid fans from the team's days at Municipal Stadium.[235] K. C. Wolf is one of the most popular NFL mascots and was the league's first mascot inducted into the Mascot Hall of Fame in 2006.[241] The Chiefs have employed a cheerleading squad since the team's inception in 1960.[242] In the team's early days, the all-female squad was referred to as the Chiefettes.[243] In addition to the Cheerleaders, in the early 1970s, there was also a dance/drill team that performed for pre-game and halftime. From 1986 to 1992, the cheerleader squad featured a mix of men and women.[242] From 1993 to 2019, the all-female squad has been known as the Chiefs Cheerleaders, and in 2020, one male joined the team.[235][242][243] Running backs (RB) Wide receivers (WR) Tight ends (TE) Defensive linemen (DL) Defensive backs (DB) Special teams Reserve 53 active, 12 reserve, 14 practice squad (+1 exempt) Twenty-five members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame spent at least some portion of their career with the Chiefs. Thirteen spent the majority of the career with the Chiefs. Ten of the Chiefs in the Hall of Fame were involved with the Chiefs during their Super Bowl Championship season of 1969. The Chiefs have 3 contributors, 3 coaches, and 18 players in the Hall of Fame. Derrick Thomas is the only Chief in the Hall of Fame that was inducted posthumously. Listed below are only people whose tenure with the Chiefs is their reason for induction, not former Chiefs coaches inducted as a player, the only exception being Emmitt Thomas who was inducted as a player for the Chiefs and later become an assistant coach for the team. Established in 1970, the Chiefs Hall of Fame has inducted a new member, with the exception of the 1983 and 2020 seasons, every year to honor their players, coaches, and contributors in an annual ceremony.[244][245] The requirements for induction are that a player, coach, or contributor must have been with the Chiefs for four seasons and been out of the NFL for four seasons at the time of induction.[244] There are some exceptions, such as Joe Delaney and Derrick Thomas, Delaney was with the team for only two seasons before his death, Thomas was inducted 1 year after his death in January 2000 (2 years after his final season). The Chiefs have the second-most enshrinees of any NFL team in their team Hall of Fame behind the Green Bay Packers, who have enshrined over 100 players and team contributors over the years in the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame.[244] Nineteen players and the coach of the Super Bowl IV championship team have been inducted into the ring of honor. Three players were posthumously inducted, Derrick Thomas, Joe Delaney, and Mack Lee Hill. *Posthumous induction†Hall's primary position was wide receiver and is listed in the Chiefs Hall of Honor as a receiver. However, he was inducted because of his accomplishments as a return specialist. Three Chiefs players own major NFL records. Patrick Mahomes owns the record for career quarterback rating with a minimum of 1,500 attempts with 103.9,[246] Derrick Thomas owns the record for sacks in a single game with 7 which he accomplished in 1990,[247] and Travis Kelce owns the record for career receptions in the playoffs.[248] Additionally, Tony Gonzalez, who spent the majority his career with the Chiefs, is the career receiving yards and receptions leader among tight ends. Chiefs players own several less notable records, for example, Mahomes owns the record for fastest quarterback to 100 career passing touchdowns. For a list of franchise records, see List of Kansas City Chiefs records Thirteen head coaches have served the Texans/Chiefs franchise since their first season in 1960.[249] Hank Stram, the team's first head coach, led the Chiefs to three AFL championship victories and two appearances in the Super Bowl.[250] Stram was the team's longest-tenured head coach, holding the position from 1960 to 1974.[41] Marty Schottenheimer was hired in 1989 and led Kansas City to seven playoff appearances in his ten seasons as head coach.[45][53] Schottenheimer had the best winning percentage (.634) of all Chiefs coaches.[55] Gunther Cunningham was on the Chiefs' coaching staff in various positions from 1995 to 2008, serving as the team's head coach in between stints as the team's defensive coordinator.[58][59] Dick Vermeil coached the team to a franchise-best 9–0 start in the 2003 season.[251] Of the ten Chiefs coaches, Hank Stram, Marv Levy, and Dick Vermeil have been elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, Levy is more well known for his time with the Buffalo Bills.[252] Herm Edwards served as the team's head coach from 2006 to 2008, compiling a 15–33 record and a franchise worst 6–26 record over a two-year span.[105][106][253][254] Todd Haley compiled a 19–26 record with the team from 2009 to 2011, including an AFC West division title in 2010.[107] Haley was fired with three games left in the 2011 season. Romeo Crennel was named interim coach, and was promoted to full-time coach in January 2012. Crennel was fired on Monday, December 31, 2012, after finishing the 2012 season with a 2–14 record. On January 5, 2013, the Chiefs hired Andy Reid to be their next head coach. In Reid's tenure, the Chiefs have never had a sub-.500 season, making the playoffs in 10 of his 11 seasons as head coach, winning the division six times, and twice having two consecutive Super Bowl appearances, and three wins. With a 21–14 victory over the Miami Dolphins, on November 5, 2023, in Frankfurt Germany, Andy Reid tied former Chiefs head coach Hank Stram on the franchise's all-time regular season wins list with 124 victories.[255][256] The franchise was founded in 1959 by Lamar Hunt after a failed attempt by Hunt to purchase an NFL franchise and relocate them to Texas.[257] Hunt remained the team's owner until his death in 2006.[257] The Hunt family kept ownership of the team following Lamar's death and Clark Hunt, Lamar's son, represents the family's interests.[194] While Hunt's official title is CEO and Chairman of the Board, he represents the team at all owner meetings.[258][259] In 2010, Hunt assumed role as CEO alongside his role as chairman of the board.[260] According to Forbes, the team began the 2024 season valued at $4.85 billion USD, ranking them 24th among the 32 NFL teams.[261] Owner Lamar Hunt served as the team's president from 1960 to 1976. Because of Lamar Hunt's contributions to the NFL, the AFC Championship trophy is named after him.[262] He promoted general manager Jack Steadman to become the team's president in 1977.[262] Steadman held the job until Carl Peterson was hired by Hunt in 1988 to replace him.[262] Peterson resigned the title as team president in 2008.[263] Denny Thum became the team's interim president following Peterson's departure and was officially given the full position in May 2009.[263][264] Thum resigned from his position on September 14, 2010.[260] Don Rossi served as the team's general manager for half of the 1960 season, resigning in November 1960.[25] Jack Steadman assumed duties from Rossi and served in the position until 1976.[25][41][262] Steadman was promoted to team president in 1976 and despite being relieved of those duties in 1988,[262] he remained with the franchise until 2006 in various positions.[41][45] Jim Schaaf took over for Steadman as general manager until being fired in December 1988.[45] Carl Peterson was hired in 1988 to serve as the team's general manager, chief executive officer and team president.[45][262] Peterson remained in the position for nineteen years until he announced his resignation from the team in 2008.[263][265] Denny Thum served as interim general manager[263] until January 13, 2009, when the Chiefs named New England Patriots executive Scott Pioli the team's new general manager.[104][266] Pioli was released in early January after the hiring of Andy Reid, and was replaced by John Dorsey. Pioli's record as the Chief's general manager was 23–41. On June 22, 2017, the Chiefs fired Dorsey.[267] They hired Brett Veach as the new general manager on July 10, 2017.[268] → Coaching staff → Front office → More NFL staffs Kansas City radio station WDAF-FM (106.5) is the flagship station for The Chiefs Football Radio Network. The network has affiliates across Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, and Texas, and national reach through desktop and mobile devices. AFC Championship and Super Bowl broadcasts are exclusive to KCSP and WDAF-FM due to NFL rules surrounding the exclusivity of Westwood One's coverage outside of the immediate Kansas City area. As part of the newest television contracts, non-primetime games are broadcast on CBS or Fox with the biggest markets being the metropolitan areas of Kansas City, Wichita, and Omaha. The Chiefs' owned production company is named 65 Toss Power Trap Productions, after a play from the Chiefs Super Bowl IV victory which led to a five-yard touchdown run by Mike Garrett.[269] The Chiefs boast one of the most loyal fan bases in the NFL.[195][270] Kansas City is the sixth-smallest media market with an NFL team, but they have had the second-highest attendance average over the last decade.[199] Studies by Bizjournals in 2006 gave the Chiefs high marks for consistently drawing capacity crowds in both good seasons and bad.[271] The Chiefs averaged 77,300 fans per game from 1996 to 2006, second in the NFL behind the Washington Redskins.[271] The franchise has an official fan club called Chiefs Kingdom which gives members opportunities to ticket priority benefits and VIP treatment.[272][273] At the end of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" before home games, many Chiefs fans intentionally yell out \"CHIEFS!\" rather than singing \"brave\" as the final word.[274] This can also occasionally be heard in road games[275] and even at sporting events for the nearby University of Kansas.[276] In 1996, general manager Carl Peterson said \"We all look forward, not only at Arrowhead, but on the road, too, to when we get to that stanza of the National Anthem... Our players love it.\"[274] After the September 11, 2001 attacks, Chiefs fans refrained from doing so in honor of those who lost their lives in the tragedy and continued to do so for the remainder of the 2001 season.[277] At the Chiefs' September 23, 2001, home game against the New York Giants, fans gave the opposing Giants a standing ovation.[198] In the past, fans would chant while pointing in the direction of the visiting team, \"We're gonna beat the hell outta you...you...you, you, you, you!\" over the song \"Rock and Roll Part 2\".[278] The chant starts after the third \"hey!\" in the song.[278] The original version of the song by Gary Glitter was previously used until the NFL banned his music from its facilities in 2006 following the British rocker's conviction on sexual abuse charges in Vietnam.[278] A cover version of the song played by Tube Tops 2000[278] was used from 2006 until the 2015 season.[279] The practice was later completely discontinued prior to the 2015 season after Glitter was arrested again.[280] The team would eventually adopt Beastie Boys' \"(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)\" after Travis Kelce shouted the main chorus while celebrating victories in the AFC Championship Game and Super Bowl.[281] Notable fans include Brad Pitt, Paul Rudd, Jason Sudeikis, Henry Cavill, David Koechner, Rob Riggle, Taylor Swift, Heidi Gardner, John Amos, Melissa Etheridge, and Eric Stonestreet.[282] Arrowhead Stadium is also recognized by Guinness World Records as having the loudest outdoor stadium in the world. This was achieved on September 29, 2014, in a Monday Night Football game against the New England Patriots when the crowd achieved a roar of 142.2 decibels[283] which is comparable to standing 100 feet (30 m) from a jet engine, which even with short term exposure, can cause permanent damage.[284] The NFL introduced the league's international home marketing area program in 2021,[285] which sees teams secure international marketing rights in countries beyond the United States. The Chiefs were designated as a home team to Germany alongside the Carolina Panthers, New England Patriots, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In 2023 the NFL also granted the Chiefs permission to expand its marketing and fan outreach to Austria and Switzerland.[286] The Chiefs hosted a game in Germany during their 2023 season against the Miami Dolphins.[287][288] The Chiefs have played international regular season games against Detroit in 2015 in London, and against the LA Chargers in 2019 in Mexico City. The team participated in preseason exhibition games dubbed the American Bowl in Berlin (1990), Tokyo (1994 and 1998), and Monterrey, Mexico (1996).[287] The Chiefs' fan base has expanded across the world like many other NFL teams. A Twitter account is dedicated to Chiefs fans in the UK and has been recognized by the Kansas City Chiefs and is their official UK fan page. They have many dedicated fans writing articles and interviewing players of the team such as Tamba Hali.[289] From various periods between 1963 and the 2008 season, trumpeter Tony DiPardo and The T.D. Pack Band played live music at every Chiefs home game.[290][291] The band was known as The Zing Band when the team was located at Municipal Stadium. DiPardo was honored by head coach Hank Stram in 1969 with a Super Bowl ring for the team's victory in Super Bowl IV.[290] When his health was declining, DiPardo took a leave of absence from the band from 1983 to 1988.[291] DiPardo's daughter took over as bandleader in 1989, by which time DiPardo returned to the band by popular demand.[291][292] For the 2009 season, due to renovations at Arrowhead Stadium, the band did not return to perform at the stadium. DiPardo died on January 27, 2011, at age 98. He had been hospitalized since December 2010 after suffering a brain aneurysm.[293] For various reasons, the team has faced charges of racism and anti-Indigenous cultural appropriation and misuse of names, symbols, and practices.[294][295] The name comes from the nickname of former Kansas City mayor Harold Roe Bartle, who nicknamed himself \"Chief\" as part of creating the Tribe of Mic-O-Say, a group affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America.[296] Over the life of the franchise the following have also been displayed: an arrowhead logo, fans' \"tomahawk chop\" gestures during games, a horse named Warpaint, the use of a large drum, and the wearing of face paint, headdresses, and other Native American symbols.[297][298] Chiefs fans also carry on a tradition that began at Florida State University in the mid-1980s by using the Seminole WarChant as a rallying cry during key moments in their football games.[299][300] Prior to each home game, a former Chiefs player[301] or a famous Chiefs fan (such as NASCAR driver Clint Bowyer[302] or rapper Tech N9ne[303]), called the honorary drum leader, bangs on a drum with a large drum stick to start the Tomahawk chop. The Chiefs' and their fans' use of Native American imagery and stereotypes has been the source of controversy, as some decry usage of symbols like the \"war drum,\" songs and spectacles like the \"Tomahawk Chop,\" and stereotypical dress of fans in faux war paint and headdresses. In 2016, Native American groups asked the Kansas City Chiefs to stop doing the tomahawk chop.[304] In the same year a similar request was made of Exeter Chiefs.[305] The editorial board of the Kansas City Star newspaper called for the cessation of the \"Tomahawk Chop\" in late 2019, noting opposition from Native Americans and Tribes, and stating that the practice stereotypes and dehumanizes Native Americans.[306] The National Congress of American Indians and the Kansas City Indian Center have called for the mascot to be retired.[307] The Chiefs have escaped the more intense criticism of other teams, such as the Washington Redskins and Cleveland Indians who changed their names beginning with their 2022 seasons, for using Native American names and logos. Attention increased in 2020 in advance of their appearance in Super Bowl LIV.[308] While there have been efforts to address other issues, such as fans wearing warpaint and headdresses, the tomahawk chop and the accompanying chant is defended, including by some local Native Americans. In a national survey, half of Native Americans said the \"tomahawk chop\" bothered or offended them, rising to 65% among those more engaged in Native traditions.[309]",

                "content": "Shawn Corey Carter (born December 4, 1969), known professionally as Jay-Z,[a] is an American rapper, businessman, and record executive.[8][9][10] Rooted in East Coast hip-hop, he was named the greatest rapper of all time by Billboard and Vibe in 2023, and topped Forbes list of \"The 50 Top Rappers of All Time\" in 2024.[11][12] Known for his complex lyrical ability—which often uses double entendres and word play—and braggadocio, his music is built upon a rags to riches narrative. He served as president and chief executive officer of Def Jam Recordings from 2004 to 2007, and founded the entertainment company Roc Nation the following year.[13] A protégé of fellow New York City-based rapper Jaz-O, Jay-Z began his musical career in the late 1980s; he co-founded the record label Roc-A-Fella Records in 1994 to release his first two studio albums Reasonable Doubt (1996) and In My Lifetime, Vol. 1 (1997), both of which were met with critical acclaim. Each of his eleven subsequent albums, including The Blueprint (2001), The Black Album (2003), American Gangster (2007), and 4:44 (2017), debuted atop the Billboard 200; Jay-Z holds the record for the most number-one albums (14) of any solo artist on the chart.[14][15][16] He has also released the collaborative albums The Best of Both Worlds (2002) and Unfinished Business (2004) with singer R. Kelly,[17] Collision Course (2004) with Linkin Park, Watch the Throne (2011) with Kanye West, and Everything Is Love (2018) with his wife Beyoncé.[18] He peaked the Billboard Hot 100 on four occasions: once as a lead artist with his 2009 single \"Empire State of Mind\" (featuring Alicia Keys), and thrice with his guest performances on the singles \"Heartbreaker\" by Mariah Carey, \"Crazy in Love\" by Beyoncé, and \"Umbrella\" by Rihanna.[19] Through his business ventures, Jay-Z became the first hip-hop billionaire in 2019.[20][21] In 1999, he co-founded the clothing retailer Rocawear[22] and later founded the 40/40 Club, a luxury bar chain, in 2003. As both grew into multi-million-dollar businesses, he launched Roc Nation, a multi-disciplinary entertainment agency in 2008. In 2015, he acquired the technology company Aspiro and led the expansion of Tidal, the company's media streaming service.[23][24][25] As of 2024, he is the wealthiest musical artist in the world with a net worth of US$2.5 billion.[26] One of the world's best-selling music artists with 140 million records sold, Jay-Z has won 24 Grammy Awards, the tenth-most of all time and most awarded for any hip hop artist jointly with Kanye West.[27] He has been awarded the NAACP's President's Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, a Sports Emmy Award, and been nominated for a Tony Award. Ranked by Billboard and Rolling Stone as one of the 100 greatest artists of all time,[28][29] Jay-Z was the first rapper to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame[30] and the first solo living rapper inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2013.[8] Shawn Corey Carter was born on December 4, 1969, in Brooklyn, New York City.[31] He was raised in Marcy Houses, a public housing project in Brooklyn's Bedford–Stuyvesant neighborhood.[32] His father, Adnis Reeves,[33] abandoned the family when Jay-Z was 11 years old, and Jay-Z and his three older siblings were raised by his mother, Gloria Carter. Reeves later met and reconciled with Jay-Z prior to his death in 2003. Jay-Z claims in his lyrics to \"You Must Love Me\", the closing track on his 1997 album In My Lifetime, Vol. 1, that in 1982, at age 12, he shot his older brother Eric in the shoulder for stealing his jewelry.[34][35] He attended Eli Whitney High School and George Westinghouse Career and Technical Education High School, both in Brooklyn, and then Trenton Central High School in Trenton, New Jersey. He did not graduate, dropping out during his sophomore year at Trenton Central High School.[36] According to his interviews and lyrics, he sold crack cocaine[35] and was shot at three times during this period.[34] His former friend was sentenced to prison for possessing drugs and weapons.[37][38] Known as \"Jazzy\" around the neighborhood, he later adopted the stage name \"Jay-Z\" in homage to his mentor Jaz-O.[32][39] Jay-Z can be briefly heard on several of Jaz-O's early recordings in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including \"H. P. Gets Busy\", \"The Originators\" and \"Hawaiian Sophie\".[40][41] Jay-Z became embroiled in several battles with rapper LL Cool J in the early 1990s.[42] He first became known to a wide audience on the posse cut \"Show and Prove\" on the 1994 Big Daddy Kane album Daddy's Home. Jay-Z has been referred to as Big Daddy Kane's hype man during this period,[43] although Kane explains that he did not fill the traditional hype man role, and was instead basically making cameo appearances on stage. \"When I would leave the stage to go change outfits, I would bring out Jay-Z and Positive K and let them freestyle until I came back to the stage.\"[44][45] According to his second verse on \"99 Problems\", released in 2003, Jay-Z was allegedly stopped by an NYPD detective in 1994 while en route to I-95, possibly for a search of drugs in his car. Detection dogs were called, but another police car had passed; Jay-Z was let go soon after.[46] Jay-Z appeared on a popular song by Big L, \"Da Graveyard\", and on Mic Geronimo's \"Time to Build\", which also featured early appearances by his former Murder Inc. colleagues Ja Rule and DMX in 1995. His first official rap single was \"In My Lifetime\", which was released with an accompanying music video in 1995. An unreleased music video was also produced for the B-side \"I Can't Get with That.\"[47] With no major label to give him a record deal, Jay-Z sold burned CDs out of his car,[34] and with Damon \"Dame\" Dash and Kareem \"Biggs\" Burke, created Roc-A-Fella Records as an independent label in 1995. After striking a distribution deal with Priority, Jay-Z released his 1996 debut album Reasonable Doubt with beats from acclaimed producers such as DJ Premier and Super DJ Clark Kent and an appearance by The Notorious B.I.G. The album reached number 23 on the Billboard 200, and was generally favored by critics.[32] This album would later be included in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time as No. 248 and eventually reach platinum status.[48] After reaching a new label distribution deal with Def Jam in 1997, Jay-Z released his follow-up In My Lifetime, Vol. 1. Featuring production by Sean \"Puff Daddy\" Combs, DJ Premier, and Ski, it earned platinum status in the United States.[48] In 1998, Jay-Z released Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life which spawned the biggest hit of his career at the time, \"Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)\". He relied more on flow and wordplay, and he continued with his penchant for mining beats from the popular producers of the day such as Swizz Beatz, an upstart in-house producer for Ruff Ryders, and Timbaland.[49] Other producers included DJ Premier, Erick Sermon, The 45 King, and Kid Capri. Charting hits from this album included \"Can I Get A...\", featuring Ja Rule and Amil, and \"Nigga What, Nigga Who\", featuring Amil and Jaz-O. Vol. 2 would eventually become Jay-Z's most commercially successful album; it was certified 5× Platinum in the United States and has to date sold over five million copies.[48] The album went on to win a Grammy Award, although Jay-Z boycotted the ceremony protesting DMX's failure to garner a Grammy nomination and the academy's decision to not broadcast urban music categories.[50] In 1999, Jay-Z collaborated with Mariah Carey on \"Heartbreaker\", a song from her seventh album, Rainbow. The song became Jay-Z's first chart-topper in the U.S., spending two weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100.[51] In that same year, Jay-Z released Vol. 3... Life and Times of S. Carter. The album proved successful and sold over 3 million copies.[48] Vol. 3's most successful single was \"Big Pimpin\", featuring UGK. In 2000, Jay-Z released The Dynasty: Roc La Familia, which was originally intended to become a compilation album for Roc-A-Fella artists but Def Jam turned into a Jay-Z album.[52] The album helped to introduce newcomer producers The Neptunes, Just Blaze, Kanye West, and Bink, which have all gone on to achieve notable success. This is also the first album where Jay-Z utilizes a more soulful sound than his previous albums. The Dynasty sold over two million units in the U.S. alone.[48] In 2001, Jay-Z spoke out against Prodigy after he took an issue with a Jay-Z line from \"Money, Cash, Hoes\" that he felt alluded disparagingly to Mobb Deep and Prodigy's dispute with Tupac Shakur, Snoop Dogg, and Death Row Records. He later performed the song \"Takeover\", at Summer Jam 2001, which initially attacked Prodigy and revealed photos of Prodigy dressed like Michael Jackson.[53] A line at the end of \"Takeover\" referred to Nas, who criticized him on \"We Will Survive\".[54] Nas responded with a diss of his own, and Jay-Z straightaway added a verse to \"Takeover\" which dissed Nas and would start a feud between the two rappers. The feud had ended by 2005; Jay-Z stated that record producer Mark Pitts had helped them settle their differences.[55] On September 11, 2001, Jay-Z released his sixth studio album, The Blueprint, which received a five-mic review from hip-hop magazine The Source. Written in just two days,[56] the album sold more than 427,000 copies, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200[57] and reached double platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America.[48] Eminem guest performed and produced its song, \"Renegade\". Four tracks were produced by Kanye West. The Blueprint includes the songs \"Izzo (H.O.V.A.)\", \"Girls, Girls, Girls\", \"Jigga That Nigga\", and \"Song Cry\". As of February 2012[update], the album had sold 2.7 million copies worldwide.[58] In 2019, The Blueprint was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[59] In October 2001, Jay-Z pleaded guilty to aggravated assault for stabbing record producer Lance Rivera at the Kit Kat Klub in New York City in 1999.[60] Despite Jay-Z's sentence of three years probation for the crime, Rivera later recanted the allegations in 2023.[61][62] Jay-Z then collaborated with Chicago singer R. Kelly to release collaborative studio album, The Best of Both Worlds in March 2002. In November of that year, Jay-Z released his seventh studio album The Blueprint2: The Gift & The Curse—a double album. The album debuted on the Billboard 200 at number one, selling over 3 million units solely in the U.S.[48] and surpassing The Blueprint.[63] It yielded a single-disc re-issue, The Blueprint 2.1, which retained half of the songs from the original. Its original release spawned two hit singles, \"Excuse Me Miss\" and \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\", which features Jay-Z's then-girlfriend, Beyoncé, and contained the track \"A Dream\", featuring Faith Evans and the late Notorious B.I.G.; the re-issue spawned the single \"La-La-La\", which was a sequel to \"Excuse Me Miss\" and failed to match its commercial success. After visiting the south of France,[64] Jay-Z announced work on his eighth studio album, The Black Album at the opening of the 40/40 Club.[65] He worked with several producers including Just Blaze, The Neptunes, Kanye West, Timbaland, Eminem, DJ Quik, 9th Wonder, The Buchanans, and Rick Rubin. Notable songs on the album included \"What More Can I Say\", \"Dirt off Your Shoulder\", \"Change Clothes\", and \"99 Problems\". The Black Album has sold over 3 million copies in the U.S.[48] On November 25, 2003, Jay-Z held a concert—billed as a \"retirement party\" at Madison Square Garden in New York City, which was later the focus of his 2004 documentary, Fade to Black. All proceeds went to charity. Other performers included collaborators the Roots (in the form of his backing band), Missy Elliott, Memphis Bleek, Beanie Siegel, Freeway, Mary J. Blige, Beyoncé, Twista, Ghostface Killah, Foxy Brown, Pharrell Williams and R. Kelly, with appearances by Voletta Wallace and Afeni Shakur, the mothers of the Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur, respectively.[66] While Jay-Z had attested to a retirement from making new studio albums, various side projects and appearances soon followed. Included in these were a greatest hits record, as well as the release and tour of Unfinished Business, the second collaborative album between Jay-Z and R. Kelly. In 2004, Jay-Z collaborated with rock group Linkin Park, in which they released their collaborative remix EP Collision Course, which featured mashups of both artists' songs, as well as a concert DVD. The album's only single, \"Numb/Encore\", went on to win a Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration, and was performed with Linkin Park live at the Grammys, with a special appearance by Paul McCartney, who added verses from the song \"Yesterday\". The EP sold over 1 million copies in the U.S.[48] Jay-Z was the executive producer of The Rising Tied, the debut album of Fort Minor, the hip hop side project of Linkin Park rapper Mike Shinoda. Jay-Z also planned to retire in 2004.[67] Later in 2004, Jay-Z was named president of Def Jam Records, which led to Jay-Z, Dash and Biggs selling their remaining interests in Roc-A-Fella Records and Jay-Z taking control of both of the companies.[68] Reportedly this major industry move was prompted by disagreements between Jay-Z and Dash as to what direction Roc-A-Fella could undertake.[69] On October 27, 2005, Jay-Z headlined New York's Power 105.1 annual concert, Powerhouse. The concert was entitled the \"I Declare War\" concert leading to intense speculation in the weeks preceding the event on whom exactly Jay-Z would declare war. As he had previously \"declared war\" on other artists taking lyrical shots at him at other events, many believed that the Powerhouse show would represent an all-out assault by Jay-Z upon his rivals.[70] The theme of the concert was Jay-Z's position as president and CEO of Def Jam, complete with an on-stage mock-up of the Oval Office. Many artists made appearances such as the old roster of Roc-A-Fella records artists, as well as Ne-Yo, Teairra Marí, T.I., Young Jeezy, Akon, Kanye West, Paul Wall, The LOX, and Diddy.[71] At the conclusion of the concert, Jay-Z put many arguments to rest to the surprise of hip hop fans. The most significant development in this show was closure to the infamous hip hop rivalry between Jay-Z and Nas. The two former rivals shook hands and shared the stage together to perform Jay-Z's \"Dead Presidents\" blended with Nas's song \"The World is Yours\".[72] Jay-Z returned with his comeback album on November 21, 2006, titled Kingdom Come.[73] Jay-Z's comeback single, \"Show Me What You Got\", was leaked on the Internet in early October 2006, scheduled to be released later on that month, received heavy air-play after its leak, causing the FBI to step in and investigate.[74] Jay-Z worked with video director Hype Williams, and the single's video was directed by F. Gary Gray. The album features production from Just Blaze, Pharrell, Kanye West, Dr. Dre and Coldplay's Chris Martin (single entitled \"Beach Chair\").[75][76] The first week saw 680,000 sales of the CD, enough to be his \"biggest sales week ever\" as Billboard reported.[77] This album has sold 2 million copies in the U.S.[48] Jay-Z released his tenth album entitled American Gangster on November 6, 2007. After viewing the Ridley Scott film of the same name, Jay-Z was heavily inspired to create a new \"concept\" album that depicts his experiences as a street-hustler.[78] The album is not the film's official soundtrack, although it was distributed by Def Jam.[79] Jay-Z's American Gangster depicts his life in correlation to the movie American Gangster. At the start of the album's first single, \"Blue Magic\", Jay-Z offers a dealer's manifesto while making references to political figures of the late 1980s with the lyric: \"Blame Reagan for making me to into a monster, blame Oliver North and Iran-Contra, I ran contraband that they sponsored, before this rhymin' stuff we was in concert.\"[80] Also notable about the \"Blue Magic\" music video was Jay-Z flashing €500 notes; Harvard Business School professor Rawi Abdelal called this a \"turning point in American pop culture's response to globalization.\" The album has sold 1 million copies in the U.S.[48] On January 1, 2008, Jay-Z resigned as president of Def Jam.[81] In winter 2008, it was announced that Jay-Z would become the first major hip hop artist to headline Britain's Glastonbury Festival.[82][83] Tickets sold out quickly. Former headliner Noel Gallagher of Oasis condemned the festival organizers for choosing Jay-Z to headline a traditionally guitar-driven festival. \"I'm sorry, but Jay-Z?\" Gallagher asked, swearing. \"No chance. Glastonbury has a tradition of, kind of, guitar music, do you know what I mean? And even when they throw the odd curve balls in on a Sunday night—you go, 'Kylie Minogue? I don't know about that', do you know what I mean?—but I'm not having hip hop at Glastonbury, no way, no, no. It's wrong.\"[84] As controversy mounted, Jay-Z replied, \"We don't play guitars, Noel, but hip hop has put in its work like any other form of music. This headline show is just a natural progression. Rap music is still evolving. We have to respect each other's genre of music and move forward.\"[85] Jay-Z opened his Glastonbury set with a tongue-in-cheek cover of Oasis's iconic song \"Wonderwall\",[86] and went on to deliver a performance heralded as a successful response to pre-festival criticism.[87] He also headlined many other summer festivals in 2008, including Roskilde Festival in Denmark,[88] Hove Festival in Norway[89] and O2 Wireless Festival in London.[90] During Kanye West's concert of August 6, 2008, at Madison Square Garden, Jay-Z came out to perform a new song and he and West proclaimed that it was to be on The Blueprint 3.[91] On May 21, 2009, Jay-Z announced he would be parting ways with Def Jam, and had struck a multi-million-dollar deal to sign with Live Nation, with whom he would start his Roc Nation imprint which would serve as a record label, talent/management agency, and music publishing company[92] and also partnered with production team Stargate to start a record label called StarRoc.[93][94] Jay-Z's 11th studio album The Blueprint 3 was originally to be released on September 11, 2009,[95] but was instead released in North America on September 8, 2009, due to increasing anticipation.[96] Its international release followed on September 14.[97] It is his 11th album to reach No. 1 on the Billboard 200[98] and has surpassed Elvis Presley's previous record, making him the current solo-artist record holder.[99] On October 9, 2009, Jay-Z kicked off his tour for The Blueprint 3, during which he supported his new album in North America. In a Shave Magazine review of his performance at Rexall Place in Edmonton, Jake Tomlinson expressed that \"It was the type of smooth performance you would expect from the hip-hop superstar.\" The review gave this performance 4 stars. His North American tour continued until November 22, 2009.[100] At his concert on November 8, 2009, at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion, Rihanna joined him on stage and performed \"Hard\" for the first time, then performed \"Run This Town\" with Jay-Z.[101] Among his success, Jay-Z has ventured into producing Broadway shows. Along with Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith, Jay-Z helped produce the play Fela!, a musical celebrating the work of the late Nigerian star Fela Kuti.[102] Jay-Z said he was inspired by the power of Kuti's work and his life story, which resulted in his interest to help produce the musical.[102] Fela! is a story about an African pioneer and political activist who made his first moves on the scene during the 1970s.[102] On January 23, 2010, Jay-Z released a track, \"Stranded (Haiti Mon Amour)\", with Rihanna, and U2's Bono and The Edge, as well as performing it at the Hope For Haiti Now telethon.[103] In June 2010, Eminem and Jay-Z announced they would perform together in a pair of concerts in Detroit and New York. The event was dubbed The Home & Home Tour. The first two concerts rapidly sold out, prompting the scheduling of an additional show at each venue.[104] Jay-Z was the supporting act for U2 on the Australian and New Zealand leg of their U2 360° Tour, beginning in Auckland, New Zealand, in November 2010, followed by Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Perth in December.[105] Jay-Z also appeared on stage during U2 performances of \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\", and in Auckland also on a five-track EP entitled Watch the Throne, although it was later revealed by West that the project had become a full-length LP. Recording sessions for the album took place at various recording locations and began in November 2010. The first single released for the project was \"H•A•M\". The track was co-produced by Lex Luger and West himself. The track ended up being on the deluxe edition of the album. The follow-up to that was the second single \"Otis\", which premiered on Funkmaster Flex's Hot 97 radio show, and was later released to the iTunes Store eleven days later. The song's existence, along with several other tracks from the album, was confirmed during a listening session hosted by Jay-Z.[106] The album was first released on the iTunes Store, five days prior to its being released in physical format, a strategy Jay-Z later said was used to block an internet leak. It debuted at No. 1 on the iTunes Store in 23 countries. It also broke Coldplay's record for most albums sold in one week on the online retailer, selling 290,000 copies on iTunes alone. It held that record until Lil Wayne's Tha Carter IV was released twenty-one days later, selling 10,000 copies more. It debuted on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart at No. 1, selling 436,000 copies in its first week. The album received generally positive reviews. Jay-Z and West later gave a surprise performance of \"Otis\" at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards. Jay-Z collaborated with M.I.A on her single \"XXXO\", which achieved a fair level of success and went on to become remixed by several producers worldwide. In May 2012, Jay-Z and former Philadelphia mayor Michael A. Nutter announced Jay-Z as the curator and the headliner for the first annual \"Budweiser Made in America\" festival at Fairmount Park in Philadelphia on September 1 and 2, 2012. The performance was produced by Live Nation and assembled an eclectic lineup of \"rock, hip hop, R&B, Latin music and dance\" musicians.[107] Jay-Z and Rihanna were the two main headlining acts for BBC Radio 1's 2012 Hackney Weekend music festival on June 23 to 24.[108] Jay-Z opened his set with an appearance from Rihanna, they performed \"Run this Town\". On September 6, \"Clique\" was released, a single from the album \"Cruel Summer\", by GOOD Music. Kanye West and Big Sean starred alongside Jay-Z on the track. Jay-Z took the subway to his sold-out show at The Barclays Center on October 6, 2012.[109] On November 12, 2012, Coldplay announced that they will be playing with Jay-Z at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn on December 31.[110] On September 23, 2010, Q-Tip confirmed working on Jay-Z's follow-up album to The Blueprint 3, saying the album was to hit stores by spring 2011.[111] In May 2012 it was reported that Jay-Z would work on new music with Roc Nation producer Jahlil Beats. Beats told XXL magazine: \"Me and Jay-Z been going back and forth. He picked a couple of my joints that he's working on. I don't even wanna say too much about Jay, but we definitely working on some stuff. I haven't even sent him a bunch of beats. I sent him my favorite stuff. He hit me right back like, 'Yo, I'ma go in on this,' or, 'I like this.'\"[112] The album has been named one of the most anticipated albums of 2013 by Complex Magazine, MTV, and XXL. Production will come from Jahlil Beats, Kanye West, Rick Rubin, Swizz Beatz, Timbaland, and Pharrell Williams.[113][114] Jay-Z also made an appearance on Justin Timberlake's comeback single \"Suit & Tie\" from his third studio album The 20/20 Experience, the song itself was produced by both Jay-Z and Timberlake's mutual friend, Timbaland.[115] Timberlake and Jay-Z embarked on the co-headlining Legends of the Summer Stadium Tour.[116] During the fifth game of the 2013 NBA Finals, Carter announced his twelfth studio album, Magna Carta Holy Grail, and was released on July 4, 2013. Not long after, Jay-Z confirmed that the hyphen in his stage name would be left out and officially stylized in all capital letters.[117] Magna Carta Holy Grail debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and sold 528,000 copies in its first week, which bypassed its predicted debut in the range of 350,000 to 400,000.[118] In December 2013, it was announced that Jay-Z had received nine nominations at the 2014 Grammy Awards, more than any other artist.[119] Jay-Z appeared on his wife Beyoncé's self-titled fifth studio album, Beyoncé, with a feature on the song \"Drunk in Love\". They performed this song together at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards opening.[120] The song and its accompanying album would later win three Grammy Awards including Best R&B Performance at the 2015 ceremony. In 2016, he won a lawsuit for the song \"Made in America\" with Kanye West featuring Frank Ocean against Joel McDonald.[121] In early June 2017, posters were displayed in New York City and Los Angeles, and banner ads were placed on the Internet promoting a Tidal-related project titled 4:44.[122] A teaser ad was aired during the NBA Finals on June 7 featuring actors Mahershala Ali, Lupita Nyong'o and Danny Glover in a one-minute video, ending in \"4:44 – 6.30.17, Exclusively on Tidal\". On June 18, the project was confirmed to be a new Jay-Z album, and a clip featuring a song titled \"Adnis\" was posted on Sprint's YouTube page.[122] 4:44 was released through Roc Nation and Universal Music Group, as an exclusive to Sprint and Tidal customers. The album is the first in a planned series of music exclusives from the Sprint–Tidal partnership. For a short time, on July 2, the album was made available for free digital download in Tidal's site. A physical edition was released on July 7, including three additional tracks. On the same day, the album was made available to other streaming platforms, such as Apple Music, Google Play Music and Amazon Music. The album received widespread acclaim from critics, who praised its emotional and personal content. On July 5, the album was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), in recognition of one million copies purchased by Sprint and offered to consumers as free downloads.[123] It debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, making it Jay-Z's 13th consecutive studio album to top the chart. The album spawned two singles, the title track \"4:44\" and \"Bam\", as well as several music videos, directed by a variety of high-profile collaborators. The album received a Grammy Award nomination for Album of the Year, while the title track was nominated for Song of the Year and \"The Story of O.J.\" was nominated for Record of the Year at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards.[124] On June 6, 2018, Jay-Z and Beyoncé kicked-off the On the Run II Tour in Cardiff, United Kingdom. Ten days later, at their final London performance, the pair unveiled Everything Is Love, their much-awaited joint studio album, credited under the name The Carters. The pair also released the video for the album's lead single, \"Apeshit\", on Beyoncé's official YouTube channel.[125][126] The song won two awards from eight nominations at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards.[127] In 2021, Jay-Z was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame along with fellow rapper LL Cool J.[128][129] He also appeared on the song \"Jail\" on Kanye West's 2021 album Donda,[130] which went on to win Grammy Award for Best Rap Song at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards[131] and on the song \"Love All\" from Drake's 2021 album Certified Lover Boy.[132] In 2022, his first feature was a collaboration with fellow rapper Pusha T, \"Neck & Wrist\" featuring Pharrell Williams from Pusha T's album, It's Almost Dry.[133] His feature was succeeded by a four-minute guest appearance on DJ Khaled's album title track, \"God Did\".[134][135] He also was awarded the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Special (Live), as a producer for the Super Bowl LVI halftime show.[136] Jay-Z says his earliest exposure to music was through his parents' record collection, which was mostly of soul artists such as Marvin Gaye and Donny Hathaway. He says \"I grew up around music, listening to all types of people... I'm into music that has soul in it, whether it be rap, R&B, pop music, whatever. As long as I can feel their soul through the wax, that's what I really listen to.\"[137] He often uses excerpts from these artists as samples in his work, particularly in the Kanye West productions included on The Blueprint.[137] Known for his lyrical prowess which often utilises double entendres, witty wordplays, and mixes messages with braggadocio, his music often describes his rise from poverty to vast wealth.[138][139][140][141][142] Royce da 5'9\" and Fredro Starr of Onyx both describe Jay-Z's emphasis on flow in the book How to Rap—Starr says that Jay-Z is \"a master of the flow—he can flow fast, he can flow slow\".[143] The book describes how Jay-Z uses 'rests' to provide structure to a verse[144] and how he uses 'partial linking' to add more rhymes to a verse.[145] Jay-Z's early style is described by Vibe as \"a distinctly Das EFX-type, stiggety style\" on his 12\" single \"Can't Get With That\",[146] referring to the fast rhythms and vocal delivery of the group Das EFX. He is also known to write lyrics in his head, as described by Pusha T of Clipse in How to Rap,[147] a style popular with many MCs such as The Notorious B.I.G.,[147] Everlast,[148] Bobby Creekwater[149] and Guerilla Black.[149] Shock G of Digital Underground describes Jay-Z's live performance style, saying he \"rarely breaks a sweat, and instead uses smoothness and clever wordplay to keep the audience interested and entertained\".[150] Jay-Z's fast rapping technique, also known as the \"triplet rhyme\", was developed during his early years of creating music with former mentor Jaz-O.[151][152] Jay-Z has also established himself as a successful entrepreneur with a business empire spanning a variety of industries from clothing lines, beverages, real estate, sport teams, and record labels.[153] In an interview, he stated that \"my brands are an extension of me. They're close to me. It's not like running GM, where there's no emotional attachment.\"[154] Jay-Z and Damon Dash are the founders of the urban clothing brand Rocawear.[155] Rocawear has clothing lines and accessories for men, women and children. The line was taken over by Jay-Z in early 2006 following a falling out with Dash. In March 2007, Jay-Z sold the rights to the Rocawear brand to Iconix Brand Group for $204 million. He retains his stake in the company and continues to oversee the marketing, licensing and product development.[155][156] Jay-Z became the first rapper in Reebok's history to endorse the company's footwear, signing a three-year endorsement deal.[157] He later appeared in a 2003 Reebok collection advertising his S. Carter Collection.[158] Later that year, he and frenemy 50 Cent appeared in a commercial to promote their S. Carter and G-Unit footwears for the company, with a Just Blaze-produced song made for it.[159] In 2006, Jay-Z's deal with Reebok expired with no renewal.[157] In 2014, Jay-Z invested $200 million in Armand de Brignac champagne—owned at the time by Sovereign Brands, a New York–based wine and spirits company—for a 100 percent stake, making it the second alcoholic product acquisition in his financial investment portfolio.[160][161] The brand is known for its popularity with high-profile artists as being the gold bottles often referred to in media.[162][163][164][165][166] His ties to the company date back to 2006, and he received millions of dollars per year for his association with Armand de Brignac before he bought the entire company.[167] Jay-Z serves as co-brand director for Budweiser Select and collaborates with the company on strategic marketing programs and creative ad development. He provides direction on brand programs and ads that appear on TV, radio, print, and high-profile events.[168] In March 2015, Jay-Z completed the $56 million acquisition of Aspiro, a Norwegian media technology company that operates the subscription-based music streaming service Tidal, which has been in operation since October 2014.[169] The music service was acquired through his company Project Panther Bidco Ltd. (an entity indirectly owned by Jay-Z's S. Carter Enterprises a company holding interests in leading international music, media and entertainment companies).[170][171] The music service combines audio and music videos with curated editorial. The main idea of the service is to bring major revenue streams back to the music artists themselves as the idea of an artist-owned streaming platform was stated as to \"restore the value to music by launching a service owned by artists.\" Jay-Z currently[when?] is a major shareholder in the company.[172][173] In July 2015, Carter made a significant investment to JetSmarter, an app helping people book private executive plane flights. The app was built by Sergey Petrossov.[174] From 2005 to 2007, Jay-Z was inaugurated as the president of Def Jam Recordings. Under Jay-Z's leadership, Def Jam launched the successful careers of contemporary R&B singers Rihanna and Ne-Yo. At the end of 2007, after he released American Gangster, Jay-Z decided not to renew his contract as the president and CEO of Def Jam. Shortly after, he started his Live Nation venture, Roc Nation.[175] In April 2011, it was reported that Jay-Z had outbid executives at Universal Music and Jive Records to acquire independent record label Block Starz Music.[176][177] For a decade (2003–2013), Jay-Z enjoyed his role as a part-owner of the Brooklyn Nets NBA team, having paid a reported $1 million for his share, which declined in value to $350,000 in April 2013, based on Forbes magazine's valuation of the team.[178] He encouraged the team's relocation to Brooklyn's Barclays Center (from New Jersey) in the 2012–2013 season, at which point the team took on the Brooklyn Nets moniker.[179][180] On April 18, 2013, Jay-Z officially announced through his Life + Times website in a press release that he would be relinquishing his ownership in the Brooklyn Nets.[181] The shares were eventually sold to singer, rapper, actor and entrepreneur Will Pan, making Pan the first American of Taiwanese descent to own a U.S. professional sports franchise.[182][183] Jay-Z's cited Pan's athletic background (he was a team captain of his high school basketball team and played in college), his multitude of musical styles, his influence in the Taiwanese American community, and his business acumen and portfolio (including being the founder and chief executive of software company Camigo Media and a co-founder of streetwear boutique N.P.C [New Project Center]), as reasons why his bid was successful.[182][183] In September 2013, his stake in Barclays Center was sold for $1.5 million.[184] On April 2, 2013, ESPN reported Jay-Z's plans to launch his own sports agency, Roc Nation Sports, with a focus on the representation of various professional athletes. The sport management group is a partnership with Creative Artists Agency.[185] In conjunction with the agency's launch, New York Yankees's second baseman Robinson Canó left agent Scott Boras to sign with the company. ESPN also mentioned that Jay-Z himself was planning to be a certified sports agent, first in baseball and eventually in basketball and football. In order to represent clients in basketball, he would have to give up his small share of the Brooklyn Nets.[185][186] In October 2005, he was reported in English media as considering buying a stake of Arsenal F.C., an English soccer team.[187] Through his conglomerate company Gain Global Investments Network LLC, he had an interest estimated between 2 and 7% in the Aqueduct Entertainment Group (AEG) consortium, which in January 2010 was awarded a contract to operate a 4,500-slot-machine racino at the Aqueduct Race Track. Jay-Z became interested in the project after New York Governor David Paterson who awarded the contract said there had to be an affirmative action component to the ownership. Jay-Z was initially approached by casino mogul Steve Wynn, who was also bidding on the contract. On March 9, 2010, Jay-Z and Flake withdrew from the project, and Paterson recused himself from further involvement.[188][189] On April 5, 2011, Jay-Z launched the popular culture and lifestyle online magazine Life + Times. It features content that showcases his high-end tastes in clothing, appliances, and cars. The site design is aesthetically aimed at the upwardly mobile young male demographic, with sports and music-related posts accompanying those about fashion and design.[190] Among the music content is the Decoded series, originating from Jay-Z's memoir of the same name and featuring a select rapper deciphering their own lyrics.[191] In January 2015, after being contacted by the webzine, the DJ and radio host Funkmaster Flex revealed that he had been contacted in 2013 for a story about a digital app he made at the time, but alleged that the information was instead used to help launch the Magna Carta Samsung app for the release of Jay-Z's album of the same name. \"But I was good with that. I ate that. Everybody's out here hustling\", Flex reasoned to Vibe.[192] In 2016, he signed a two-year exclusive film and TV Deal with Weinstein Company and with the deal gives them first-look options to create scripted and unscripted TV projects and film projects, and those projects were in works.[193] As part of his deal with Weinstein company, he produced a documentary series on the life of Kalief Browder who was imprisoned for three years and committed suicide upon his release. He also addressed racial profiling and police brutality in a conscious manner.[194] Jay-Z also co-owns the 40/40 Club, an upscale sports bar that started in New York City, and has since expanded to Atlantic City and Chicago. In 2008, the 40/40 Club in Las Vegas was closed down and bought back by the hotel after attendance steadily declined.[195] In 2005, Jay-Z became an investor in Carol's Daughter, a line of beauty products, including products for hair, skin, and hands.[196] In 2010, he announced plans to expand his 40/40 Club sports bar chain into as many as 20 airports, joining his Roc Nation business partners, husband and wife Juan and Desiree Perez, in a deal with Delaware North.[197] On November 16, 2010, Jay-Z published a memoir entitled Decoded.[198][199] The memoir was co-signed by Dream Hampton.[200] Parlux fragrances sued Jay-Z for $18 million for the failure of his cologne, Gold. They claim the cologne's failure is due to Jay-Z not doing social media posts and interviews about the cologne. Parlux claims they projected selling $15 million the first year, and $35 million the second, and subsequent years after the launch. The fragrance sold $14 million the first year and $6.1 million the second.[201] Parlux lost money on the venture and have had constant returns of unsold inventory.[202] Jay-Z collaborated with Cohiba to launch his own cigars.[203] In August 2020, Jay-Z's Roc Nation partnered with Brooklyn's Long Island University to establish the Roc Nation School of Music, Sports & Entertainment.[204] In November 2020, it was announced that Jay-Z would be join TPCO Holding Corp., a newly formed cannabis products company, in the role of \"Chief Visionary Officer\".[205] On December 5, 2022, Jay-Z and the Roc Nation announced their partnership with Caesars Entertainment to build and operate a casino property at Times Square.[206] In 2002, Jay-Z and singer Beyoncé collaborated on the song \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\". He also appeared on Beyoncé's hit single, \"Crazy in Love\" the following year, as well as the song \"That's How You Like It\" from her debut album Dangerously in Love (2003). On her second album, B'Day, he made appearances on the hits \"Déjà Vu\" and \"Upgrade U\". In the video for the latter song, she comically imitates his appearance.[207] They kept a low profile while dating, and were married on April 4, 2008, in a private ceremony in Tribeca, New York City.[208] Their relationship became a matter of public record on April 22, 2008,[209] although Beyoncé did not publicly debut her US$5 million Lorraine Schwartz-designed wedding ring until the Fashion Rocks concert on September 5, 2008.[210] Since their marriage, they generally avoid discussing their relationship,[211] and Beyoncé has stated her belief that this has helped them, while Jay-Z agreed in a People article that they do not \"play with [their] relationship\".[212] In 2006, Beyoncé and Jay-Z were listed as the most powerful couple for Time magazine's 100 most influential people.[213] In January 2009, Forbes ranked them as Hollywood's top-earning couple, with a combined total of $162 million.[214] They made it to the top of the list the following year, with a combined total of US$122 million between June 2008 and June 2009.[214] At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Beyoncé revealed that she was pregnant with their first child.[215][216] Their daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, was born at New York's Lenox Hill Hospital on January 7, 2012.[217] Jay-Z released \"Glory\", a song dedicated to Blue Ivy, through his Life+Times website on January 9, 2012.[218] The song, produced by frequent collaborators the Neptunes, detailed the couple's pregnancy struggles, including a miscarriage Beyoncé had suffered.[218] Blue Ivy's cries were included at the end of the song, and she was officially credited on the song as \"B.I.C\"; she became the youngest person in Billboard history (at two days old) have a chart entry when \"Glory\" debuted at No. 74 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs.[219] On June 18, 2017, Beyoncé's father Mathew Knowles confirmed that she had given birth to twins with Jay-Z, a daughter named Rumi and a son named Sir.[220] In the following months, they purchased a US$88 million home in the Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles.[221] In 2023, the couple bought a house in Malibu, California, designed by the architect Tadao Ando, for $200 million. It established a record for the most expensive residence sold in California.[222] On December 2, 1999, Jay-Z, who had come to believe that record executive Lance \"Un\" Rivera was behind the bootlegging of Vol. 3..., allegedly stabbed him at the Kit Kat Klub, a now-defunct night club in Times Square, New York City, during a release party for Q-Tip's album Amplified.[223] Jay-Z's associates at the party were accused of causing a commotion within the club, which Jay-Z allegedly used as cover while he stabbed Rivera in the stomach with a five-inch (127 mm) blade.[224] He surrendered to police the following evening and was placed under arrest, although he was soon released on $50,000 bail.[225][226] When he was indicted in Manhattan Criminal Court in late January 2000, he pleaded not guilty; he and his lawyers contended that they had witnesses and videotapes proving he had been nowhere near Rivera during the incident. Nevertheless, he later pleaded guilty to third-degree assault and accepted a three-year probation sentence.[227] Jay-Z later addressed the case in his 2010 book Decoded: One night I went to Q-Tip's solo album release party and at some point in the night, I ran into the guy everyone's been telling me is behind the bootleg. So I approached him. When I told him what I suspected, to my surprise, he got real loud with me right there in the middle of the club. It was strange. We separated and I went over to the bar. I was sitting there like, \"No the fuck this nigga did not...\" I was talking to people, but I was really talking to myself out loud, just in a state of shock. Before I even realized what I was doing, I headed back over to him, but this time I was blacking out with anger. The next thing I knew, all hell had broken loose in the club. That night the guy went straight to the police and I was indicted. [...] There was no reason to put my life on the line, and the lives of everyone who depends on me, because of a momentary loss of control. [...] I vowed to never allow myself to be in a situation like that again.[228] In 2023, Rivera stated that Jay-Z lied, and was not the one that stabbed him: \"No. Jay-Z was not the guy that actually stabbed me that night (...) it's never been his history\".[229][230][231] In December 2024, Jay-Z, along with Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, was accused in a civil lawsuit of raping a 13-year-old girl at an MTV Video Music Awards after-party in 2000. Jay-Z denied the allegations and described it as a blackmail attempt.[232] Jay-Z responded to the plaintif's lawyer Tony Buzbee on social media that \"No sir, it had the opposite effect! It made me want to expose you for the fraud you are in a VERY public fashion. So no, I will not give you ONE RED PENNY!!\"[233] Combs' legal team described this allegation as another in a long line of lies about Combs.[234] On 9 December, Jay-Z filed both a motion requesting that the accuser identify themself and a lawsuit against the accuser's attorney.[235] During his first retirement from music,[failed verification] Jay-Z became involved in philanthropy. In 2003, along with his mother, Jay-Z founded the Shawn Carter Foundation, which assists eligible students facing socio-economic hardships attend and get through college.[236] In August 2006, he met with Kofi Annan, then Secretary-General of the United Nations at the organization's New York City headquarters, where he pledged to use his upcoming world tour to raise awareness of the global water shortage, a challenge he learned about following a visit to Africa by Bono, the lead singer of U2.[237] The effort took place in partnership with the UN,[238] as well as MTV, which produced a documentary entitled Diary of Jay-Z: Water for Life, first airing in November 2006.[239] Along with Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, Jay-Z pledged $1 million to the American Red Cross's relief effort after Hurricane Katrina.[240] Jay-Z supported Kanye West after West's outburst against President George W. Bush during a live Katrina charity telethon.[241] He also addressed the Katrina disaster and the federal government's response in his one-verse song \"Minority Report\".[242] Jay-Z has said that \"the greatest form of giving is anonymous to anonymous\". In 2013, author dream hampton, who co-wrote Jay-Z's book Decoded, revealed that Jay-Z had established a trust fund for Sean Bell's children.[243] Jay-Z donated to bail out protestors arrested during 2015 activism against police brutality.[244][245] In March 2020, Jay-Z donated $1 million through the Shawn Carter Foundation to aid in relief during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York.[246] In April 2020, along with Meek Mill, he donated over 100,000 face masks to U.S. prisons to assist in protecting prison inmates from COVID-19.[247] In 2006, Jay-Z appeared with Russell Simmons in a public service announcement denouncing racism and anti-Semitism, sponsored by the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding.[248] In 2008, Jay-Z was involved in the 2008 United States presidential election, supporting enhanced voter participation.[249] He supported the 2008 presidential candidacy of Barack Obama and performed voter-drive concerts financed by the Democrats' campaign.[250] He also became acquainted with Obama, who in June 2008 said, \"Every time I talk to Jay-Z, who is a brilliant talent and a good guy, I enjoy how he thinks. That's somebody who is going to start branching out and can help shape attitudes in a real positive way.\"[251] During the 2010 mid-term elections, Jay-Z appeared with other artists in a HeadCount advertisement, urging voters, especially younger ones, to register and vote.[252] In May 2012, Jay-Z endorsed President Obama's support of same-sex marriage[253] and participated in his re-election campaign.[254] Musician and civil rights activist Harry Belafonte was critical of Jay-Z and Beyoncé for what he saw as their safe political stances, saying that they \"have turned their back on social responsibility\".[255] In the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Jay-Z and Beyoncé appeared at a Hillary Clinton rally in Cleveland.[256] Clinton praised Jay-Z for addressing racism, oppression, and the criminal justice system.[257] He described Donald Trump as a \"superbug\" and condemned remarks he perceived as racist,[258] but later said that Trump's rhetoric forced people to come together and address difficult issues such as white privilege.[259] Solo studio albums Collaborative albums In 2006, he was enstooled as the Sarkin Waka of Kwara in the Nigerian chieftaincy system.[266]",

                "content": "Shawn Corey Carter (born December 4, 1969), known professionally as Jay-Z (stylized as JAY-Z),[a] is an American rapper, songwriter, record producer, record executive, actor, and entrepreneur. He is the former CEO of Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records. Jay-Z co-owns The 40/40 Club and the Brooklyn Nets NBA team. He is one of the most financially successful hip-hop artists and businessmen in America.[8] Jay-Z has several nicknames, \"Jigga\", \"Hova\" and \"El Presidente\". In June 2019, it was reported that Jay-Z had become the first billionaire rapper.[9] Jay-Z was born as Shawn Corey Carter in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. He was raised in Marcy Houses, a housing project in Brooklyn's Bedford–Stuyvesant. After their father Adnis Reeves abandoned the family, Jay-Z and his three siblings were raised by their mother, Gloria Carter. Reeves would later meet and reconcile with Jay-Z shortly before dying in 2003. Jay-Z claims in his lyrics that in 1982, at age 12, he shot his older brother in the shoulder for stealing his jewelry. Along with rapper AZ he attended Eli Whitney High School in Brooklyn until it was closed. He then attended nearby George Westinghouse Career and Technical Education High School with rappers The Notorious B.I.G. and Busta Rhymes, followed by a stint at Trenton Central High School in Trenton, New Jersey, though he did not graduate. According to his interviews and lyrics, he sold crack cocaine and was shot at three times during this period. According to his mother, Jay-Z used to wake up his siblings at night banging out drum patterns on the kitchen table. She bought him a boombox for his birthday, sparking his interest in music, and he began freestyling and writing lyrics. Known as \"Jazzy\" around the neighborhood, he later adopted the stage name \"Jay-Z\" in homage to his mentor Jaz-O. Jay-Z can be briefly heard on several of Jaz-O's early recordings in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including \"H. P. Gets Busy\", \"The Originators\" and \"Hawaiian Sophie\". Jay-Z became embroiled in several battles with rapper LL Cool J in the early 1990s. He first became known to a wide audience on the posse cut \"Show and Prove\" on the 1994 Big Daddy Kane album Daddy's Home. Jay-Z has been referred to as Big Daddy Kane's hype man during this period, although Kane explains that he did not fill the traditional hype man role, and was instead basically making cameo appearances on stage. \"When I would leave the stage to go change outfits, I would bring out Jay-Z and Positive K and let them freestyle until I came back to the stage.\" The young Jay-Z appeared on a popular song by Big L, \"Da Graveyard\", and on Mic Geronimo's \"Time to Build\", which also featured early appearances by DMX and Ja Rule in 1995. His first official rap single was called \"In My Lifetime\", for which he released a music video in 1995. An unreleased music video was also produced for the B-side \"I Can't Get with That.\" In 2003, Jay-Z stopped rapping, because he found that there were not enough good rappers to compete with him. He said that the game was too easy for him. He decided to concentrate more on his producer career than his rap career. He became the president of Def Jam Recordings. He signed a lot of great artists such as Rihanna, Ne-Yo and Kanye West. He also became a businessman by creating his own clothing company, Rocawear, and owning a part of the Brooklyn Nets, an NBA basketball team. After a step back in his career, he made a decision in 2006 to come back into the game. He created the albums \"Kingdom Came\" and the year after \"American Gangster\". In 2009, he released Blue print 3, but in 2011 he teamed up with Kanye West to do an LP called Watch the Throne. This album went triple hit, made the top rap charts for August and also nominated for the Grammy for the best rap Album. Now, he is known to be one of the best rappers of all time. In April 2011 Jay-Z started a website called Life+ Times. He also took part in Barack Obama’s last elections.[10] Jay-Z's twelfth album, Magna Carta Holy Grail, was released in July 2013. The album topped the chart to number one. It was nominated for Album of the Year at the 2013 BET Hip Hop Awards. The first single on the album, \"Holy Grail\", features Justin Timberlake singing in it. It reached number four on the US Billboard 100.[11] In South Korea it reached number one. Jay-Z's wife Beyoncé sings on \"Part II (On the Run)\". In December 2013 Jay-Z was nominated for nine Grammy Awards. This was more than anyone else that year.[12] He rapped on his wife Beyoncé Knowles' fifth album Beyoncé. Together with Beyoncé, Jay-Z has three children: daughter Blue Ivy (born January 7th, 2012)[13] and twins Rumi and Sir Carter.[14] JAY-Z has released the following albums during his career:",

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. JAY-Z (born December 4, 1969, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.) is an American rapper and entrepreneur, one of the most influential figures in hip-hop in the 1990s and early 21st century. Shawn Carter grew up in Brooklyn’s often dangerous Marcy Projects, where he was raised mainly by his mother. His firsthand experience with illicit drug dealing would inform his lyrics when he began rapping under the stage name Jazzy, soon shortened to Jay-Z (a name that may also have been derived from the proximity of the J and Z subway lines to the Marcy Projects). Jay-Z and two friends founded their own company, Roc-A-Fella Records, to release his debut album, Reasonable Doubt (1996), which eventually sold more than a million copies in the United States. A string of successful albums followed at a rate of at least one per year through 2003. Vol. 2: Hard Knock Life (1998) not only was the first of Jay-Z’s releases to top the Billboard 200 album chart but also won him his first Grammy Award, for best rap album. The critically acclaimed The Blueprint (2001), featuring the triumphant hit “Izzo (H.O.V.A.),” solidified his status as one of the preeminent voices in hip-hop at the dawn of the 21st century. Shortly after its release, Jay-Z pleaded guilty to assault relating to a 1999 nightclub stabbing and received three years’ probation, but the incident did little to derail his career. Ahead of the release of The Black Album (2003), however, Jay-Z announced his retirement as a performer. The ostensible farewell recording proved to be one of his most popular, with the brash single “99 Problems,” produced by Rick Rubin, attracting considerable attention. In 2004 he assumed the presidency of Def Jam Recordings, making him one of the most highly placed African American executives in the recording industry at the time. Postretirement, Jay-Z stayed remarkably active in music. He collaborated with the rock group Linkin Park in 2004, and he appeared as a guest vocalist on the recordings of numerous other artists, including Kanye West, whose career he had helped foster, and Beyoncé, whom he had begun dating. (The two were married in 2008.) Jay-Z also developed a large portfolio of business ventures and investments, including a film-production company, a clothing line, and a stake in the New Jersey Nets of the National Basketball Association, which he later helped relocate to his hometown of Brooklyn. He formally returned to recording in 2006 with Kingdom Come. In 2007, shortly after releasing the album American Gangster, he stepped down as Def Jam president. He founded a new label, Roc Nation, in 2008, and it soon became a full-service entertainment conglomerate. Jay-Z proved that he remained one of rap’s most-bankable acts when he embarked on a highly successful tour with Mary J. Blige in 2008. The following year he released The Blueprint 3, which bore the sound of some of his most frequent producers, including West and Timbaland. The album generated such hits as “Empire State of Mind,” a musical love letter to New York City adorned with soaring guest vocals by Alicia Keys, and the determined “Run This Town,” which featured West and Rihanna. Both songs won Grammy Awards, as did two other singles from the album. Watch the Throne (2011), an ambitious and highly regarded collaboration with West, proved to be similarly fruitful, with the singles “Otis,” “Niggas in Paris,” and “No Church in the Wild” capturing Grammys as well. In between the two releases, Jay-Z published a memoir, Decoded (2010). Jay Z (having dropped the hyphen from his name) returned in 2013 with Magna Carta Holy Grail, which, in an exclusive deal with Samsung, was made available for free to users of the company’s smartphones several days ahead of its official release. Although the album, on which the rapper reflected on his massive wealth and fame, was greeted with mostly lukewarm reviews, it became his 13th release to land at number one on the Billboard 200. It also produced two Grammy wins: one for best rap/sung collaboration for “Holy Grail” and another for best music video for “Suit & Tie.” He received two more Grammys a year later for his collaboration on Beyoncé’s song “Drunk in Love.” In 2017 JAY-Z (having capitalized the letters and reinstated the hyphen in his name) released his 13th studio solo album, 4:44, an extremely candid album that was, in part, a response to Beyoncé’s Lemonade (2016), on which she accused her husband of adultery. He admitted to infidelity on various tracks and also addressed racism and politics. The couple’s albums were both released exclusively on TIDAL—a subscription-based music streaming service that JAY-Z owned alongside other artists. JAY-Z had acquired the service in 2015 when he purchased its parent, the Norwegian technology company Aspiro AB. Also in 2017 JAY-Z became the first rapper to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2018 he and Beyoncé, billed as the Carters, unveiled the collaborative effort Everything Is Love, for which they won the Grammy for best urban contemporary album. In 2021 JAY-Z was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.",
