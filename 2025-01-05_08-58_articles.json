                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Baltimore Ravens are AFC North champions and will enter the playoffs as the No. 3 seed in the conference. This division title comes as Baltimore came away with a 35-10 win over the Cleveland Browns at home to wrap up the regular season. This loss drops Cleveland to 3-14 to end its 2024 campaign. The Ravens were a bit slow to jump out to their lead, as the offense took a few drives to get moving. However, that didn't stop John Harbaugh's team from getting points on the scoreboard early. During Cleveland's second offensive possession of the night, rookie corner Nate Wiggins picked off Browns starter Bailey Zappe for his first career interception and returned it 26 yards for a touchdown. From there, Jackson led a touchdown drive in the opening minutes of the second quarter to build up a two-score lead at the break. Then the Ravens opened up the third quarter with a seven-play, 70-yard touchdown drive where Jackson found a wide-open Rashod Bateman to extend the lead. The second half -- particularly the fourth quarter -- was where Baltimore blew the doors open. After Zappe scored Cleveland's lone touchdown of the game on a pass to Jordan Akins, Baltimore scored back-to-back touchdowns to make it a 25-point lead. Derrick Henry was the catalyst of that run as he piled up 130 yards rushing and two touchdowns in the second half en route to the win and the division title. Lamar Jackson finished his night completing 16 of his 32 passes for 217 yards and two touchdowns. He also rushed for 63 yards. Thanks to those totals, Jackson became the first quarterback ever with 4,000 yards passing and 800 yards rushing in a single season. As for Zappe, he concluded his game 16 of 31 for 170 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions. From here, the Ravens will stick around M&T Bank Stadium as the No. 3 seed and gear up for the opening round of the playoffs. They'll also wait to see how the rest of the Week 18 slate unfolds to see who they'll host on Super Wild Card Weekend. As for the Browns, they'll be scoreboard-watching on Sunday as well. This loss locked them into a top-three pick at the 2025 NFL Draft, but wins by both the Patriots and Titans on Sunday would shoot them up to the No. 1 overall pick. As the clock hits zeros, the Baltimore Ravens clinch the AFC North and will be the No. 3 seed in the conference. Meanwhile, the Browns have clinched a top-three pick at the 2025 NFL Draft. And we have ourselves a big man interception! Defensive tackle Michael Pierce picks off Bailey Zappe! And there's your exclamation point! Derrick Henry lays the hammer down with a 43-yard touchdown run. I'm pretty surprised the Ravens still have their starters out there at this point, if we're being honest. It's an 18-point lead with under five minutes to go. The birthday boy gets into the end zone. Derrick Henry barrels in for a 2-yard touchdown to help make it a 28-10 lead for Baltimore with just under seven minutes to play in regulation. Bateman is having himself a day. He's up to 76 yards on five catches to go with a touchdown to begin the second half. As we noted, Lamar Jackson, Derrick Henry and Co. come back onto the field for this drive. That touchdown was the first for the Browns in the last 25 offensive drives. Another wrinkle to that score to make it an 11-point game is that the Ravens will likely keep their starters on the field. The Cleveland Browns are in the end zone. Bailey Zappe finds Jordan Akins for a 16-yard touchdown. Those Ravens -20 bettors are likely sweating quite a bit right now. Upon review, the call is reversed. It's an incomplete pass. This might be too close to reverse, but I did think that the ball was knocked free before that third foot was down. The Ravens biggest opponent tonight has mostly been themselves. They've been called for nine penalties for 78 yards. On his sixth target of the day, Jerry Jeudy records his first reception. That's a great well-timed hit by Humphrey to knock the ball out of Jerry Jeudy's hands. Jeudy is without a catch currently. With the Ravens inching closer to locking up the AFC North and No. 3 seed, it's worth noting that they could either play the Pittsburgh Steelers or the Los Angeles Chargers. Some would say it's a \"slow\" day for Derrick Henry, but that 20-plus yard rush now has him averaging 5.7 yards per carry. The Baltimore Ravens need to be careful here. Now it's Kyle Hamilton who is down on the field. John Harbaugh may soon consider resting some key players with a 21-3 lead. Rashod Bateman was WIDE open on that touchdown. That's No. 41 for Lamar Jackson through the air this season. That's such a tiny window for Lamar Jackson to fit that ball into and a remarkable sliding catch by Mark Andrews. This duo has heated up over the second half of the season and will be a force in the playoffs. Per CBS Research, Derrick Henry is the fourth player in NFL history with 1,800+ rush yards in multiple seasons. The cart is coming out for Hall, who is being put in an air cast.

                "content": "BALTIMORE â The Baltimore Ravens are AFC North champions. The Cleveland Browns are waiting to see if they'll pick No. 1 overall in April's draft. Cleveland lingered around for the better part of three quarters before the Ravens opened things up in the fourth quarter. The result was a 35-10 Baltimore win that ends the Browns' season at 3-14. It's the worst mark for Cleveland since going 0-16 in 2017. Baltimore, which clinched the division title with the win, is 12-5. Bailey Zappe was 16 of 31 for 171 yards with a touchdowns and two interceptions, one of which was returned for a Ravens touchdown, in his first start for the Browns. Dorian Thompson-Robinson was 2 of 3 for 13 yards in his only series. The Browns need both the New England Patriots and Tennessee Titans to lose on Sunday in order to jump to No. 1 in the draft. They can't draft any lower than No. 3. Here's how today's season finale in Charm City unfolded for the Browns: Wide receiver Jerry Jeudy took two short passes to open the Browns' drive to pass Ozzie Newsome and Kellen Winslow II for the franchise record for receptions with 90. His total passes Ozzie Newsome, who did it twice, and Kellen Winslow II in 2006, for the mark. The Ravens now lead 35-10 with 3:04 remaining after Derrick Henry got loose for a 43-yard touchdown run. Henry has 138 yards, 130 of those in the second half, on 20 carries with two touchdowns. The Ravens had a forceful answer to the Browns' touchdown. Running back Derrick Henry's 2-yard touchdown run with 6:44 remaining capped an eight-play, 70-yard scoring drive to make it 28-10 Baltimire. It was Henry's 15th rushing touchdown of the season, setting a new Baltimore single-season record. The former mark of 14 was set by Jamal Lewis in 2003. The Browns have reached double figures for the first time since their Week 14 loss in Pittsburgh. Quarterback Bailey Zappe hit tight end Jordan Akins for a 16-yard touchdown with 11:33 remaining, cutting the Ravens lead to 21-10. Jamari Thrash grabbed a pass down the left sideline from quarterback Bailey Zappe. The rookie wide receiver was credited with a touchdown, even though the ball came loose after he was in the end zone. Replay showed Thrash never completed the catch, making it second and 10 from the Ravens 30 with 13:42 remaining. The Ravens lead by 18 points going into the final 15 minutes. The Browns currently face a third and 16 at their own 38. The Browns announced cornerback Martin Emerson Jr. has an ankle injury. He is questionable to return. Cornerback Mike Ford Jr. went to the locker room after a visit to the medical tent for the Browns. He was shaken up on a 2-yard run by Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson. Ford is questionable to return with a forearm injury. Lamar Jackson fired a strike to a wide-open Rashod Bateman for a 7-yard touchdown pass with 10:42 remaining in the third quarter. It gave the Ravens a 21-3 lead. Browns rookie Mike Hall Jr. sustained an injury to his right knee that required him to have an air cast placed on it. He was carted off the field after the injury, which occurred with 13:27 remaining in the third quarter. Hall, the Streetsboro High School and Ohio State product, spent four weeks on injured reserve after an MCL in his right knee prior to the Week 11 game against the New Orleans Saints. He also lost five games to a suspension for a domestic violence charge he was arrested for in August. The Browns announced he was out shortly afterward. The Ravens will take an 11-point lead into the locker room for halftime. Baltimore will also have the second-half kickoff to receive. Bailey Zappe was 5-of-11 passing for 55 yards with an interception and a 22.9 passer rating. Dorian Thompson-Robinson was 2-of-3 passing for 13 yards and a 75.7 rating in his one series for the Browns. Baltimore's Lamar Jackson was 10-of-21 passing for 108 yards with a touchdown and a 79.1 rating. He's also gained 59 yards on six rushing attempts. The Browns defense bowed up again, this time on a fourth and 3 from their own 23. Quarterback Lamar Jackson was pressured by multiple defensive linemen and threw a pass to tight end Mark Andrews that was broken up by cornerback Cameron Mitchell. The deflected ball nearly was caught by a diving wide receiver Rashod Bateman, but he couldn't hold on with 2:55 remaining in the second quarter. Dustin Hopkins made a 23-yard field goal to get Cleveland on the board. The Browns trail the Ravens 14-3 with 6:33 remaining in the second quarter. Two penalties on Baltimore nose tackle Travis Jones helped set up the Browns at the Ravens 10. One was a roughing the passer on third and 3 from the Baltimore 33, the other a holding call after a 3-yard D'Onta Foreman run on second and 10 from the Baltimore 18. Bailey Zappe returned to quarterback for the Browns to start their fifth possession. Dorian Thompson-Robinson was in for one series, going 2 of 3 for 13 yards. The Ravens have pushed their lead to 14-0 as quarterback Lamar Jackson found tight end Mark Andrew on a 12-yard touchdown pass. Baltimore suffered a significant injury on the drive as wide receiver Zay Flowers sustained a knee injury on a 12-yard catch and run and is questionable to return. The Ravens have a 7-0 lead over the Browns at the end of one quarter. Cleveland has a third and 14 from its own 16 to start the second quarter. The Browns made a quarterback change on their fourth possession, going to Dorian Thompson-Robinson. Bailey Zappe was 1 of 3 for 21 yards with an interception returned for a touchdown. The Browns defense managed to turn the Ravens away. But not without Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson almost pulling another sensational play out. On fourth and 1 from the Browns 9, Jackson took off running to the right. Just as he was getting hit by safety Grant Delpit, he threw what looked like almost a baby hook of a pass to running back Derrick Henry, who was in the end zone. Henry got a finger on the pass, but couldn't bring it in. That gave the Browns the ball back with 2:41 remaining in the first quarter. The Browns tried to go for it on fourth and 1 from their own 39. They faked a run and quarterback Bailey Zappe threw a deep slant to wide receiver Jerry Jeudy that cornerback Marlon Humphrey broke up. Ravens first-round draft pick, cornerback Nate Wiggins, picked off Bailey Zappe on the second play of the second Browns possession. He returned it 26 yards for a Baltimore touchdown and a 7-0 lead with 8:32 left in the first quarter. That was the 22nd interception thrown by a Browns quarterback this season. Cleveland has intercepted four passes as a defense. The Ravens had to punt on their first drive, but not before reaching the Browns 47. It was also after they failed to connect on two potential big plays. On first down from the Baltimore 47, tight end Mark Andrews beat cornerback Martin Emerson Jr., but the pass was too long. On third and 5 from the Cleveland 47, a slant pass to Zay Flowers was dropped. The Browns may have lost another running back before he even carried the ball. John Kelly Jr. was questionable to return after the first Cleveland series due to a groin injury. Kelly was signed to the active roster on Tuesday due to injuries to Jerome Ford and Pierre Strong. Here's the first 11 on the field for the Browns defense: The Ravens won the toss and deferred. The Browns took the football and started with these 11 players: Shortly before the start of the season finale, Browns cornerback Martin Emerson Jr. was fined $8,012 for a facemask in the third quarter of last Sunday's loss to the Miami Dolphins. He was flagged for the penalty, which occurred with 14:09 remaining in the third quarter when he grabbed Miami's Tyreek Hill's facemask. Devin Bush was a late addition to the Browns injury report on Saturday. Turns out, the thigh injury the linebacker sustained will keep him out of the game. Bush was the only real surprise to the inactive list, only because of the late nature of the injury. He wasn't on the injury list before Saturday. The rest of the inactive players for the Browns are About four hours before kickoff, the Browns added another player to their injury list. This time, it was linebacker Devin Bush, who was questionable with a thigh injury. Kickoff is at 4:30 p.m. Tickets for Saturday's game on StubHub can be purchased on StubHub from $32 before fees. It's a mostly but chilly January afternoon in Baltimore, with the temperature at kickoff expected to be a high near 34, according to the National Weather Service. Breezy, with a west wind 13 to 20 mph, with gusts as high as 32 mph. Cleveland fell to 3-13 for the season with a 20-3 loss to the Miami Dolphins last Sunday afternoon in Cleveland. The Browns failed to score on three red-zone trips, while quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson threw an interception and also fumbled on a sack. The Ravens improved to 11-5 by beating the Houston Texans 31-2 on Christmas Day in Houston. Derrick Henry rushed for 147 yards and a touchdowns for the Ravens, while Lamar Jackson threw for 168 yards and a score, along with 87 rushing yards and a score. So what should we expect from the Browns this afternoon against the Ravens? Click here to see what our writers project as the score of today's game. Today is the 52nd all-time regular-season or playoff meeting between the Browns and the Ravens, which dates back to 1999, when Cleveland was awarded an expansion franchise to replace the former one which had moved to Baltimore in 1996 to become the Ravens. Here's a look at the series between the Browns and Ravens. The Browns announced Friday they were placing running backs Jerome Ford and Pierre Strong and tight end David Njoku on injured reserve. They also announced defensive tackle Dalvin Tomlinson, originally listed as questionable on Thursday with a knee injury, has been downgraded to out for the finale. The corresponding roster additions involved signing wide receiver Kaden Davis, defensive tackle Michael Dwumfour and safety Christopher Edmonds to the active roster from the practice squad. They also did standard game day elevations for cornerback Kahlef Hailassie and running back Jacob Kibodi from the practice squad. Chris Easterling can be reached at ceasterling@thebeaconjournal.com.

                "title": "Premier League - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Premier League is a professional association football league in England and the highest level of the English football league system. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League (EFL). Seasons usually run from August to May, with each team playing 38 matches: two against each other team, one home and one away.[1] Most games are played on weekend afternoons, with occasional weekday evening fixtures.[2] The competition was founded as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992, following the decision of First Division (the top-tier league from 1888 until 1992) clubs to break away from the English Football League. However, teams may still be relegated to and promoted from the EFL Championship. The Premier League is a corporation managed by a chief executive, with member clubs acting as shareholders.[3] The Premier League takes advantage of a Â£5 billion television rights deal, with Sky and BT Group securing the domestic rights to broadcast 128 and 32 games, respectively.[4][5] This deal will rise to Â£6.7 billion for the four seasons from 2025 to 2029.[6] The league is projected to earn $7.2 billion in overseas TV rights from 2022 to 2025.[7] Clubs were apportioned central payment revenues of Â£2.4 billion in 2016â17, with a further Â£343 million in solidarity payments to EFL clubs.[8] The Premier League is the most-watched sports league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes, with a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people.[9][10] For the 2023â24 season, the average Premier League match attendance was 38,375,[11] second to the German Bundesliga's 39,512,[12] whilst aggregated attendance across all matches in a 38-game season is the highest of any association football league.[13] Most stadium occupancies are near capacity.[14] As of 2023[update], the Premier League is ranked first in the UEFA coefficient rankings based on performances in European competitions over the past five seasons, ahead of Spain's La Liga.[15] The English top-flight has produced the second-highest number of European Cup / UEFA Champions League titles, with a record six English clubs having won fifteen European championships in total.[16] Fifty-one clubs have competed in the Premier League since its inception in 1992: 49 from England and 2 from Wales. Seven of them have won the title: Manchester United (13), Manchester City (8), Chelsea (5), Arsenal (3), Blackburn Rovers (1), Leicester City (1), and Liverpool (1).[17] Only six clubs have played in every season to date: Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United, and Tottenham Hotspur.[18] Despite significant European success in the 1970s and early 1980s, the late 1980s marked a low point for English football. Stadiums were deteriorating, supporters endured poor facilities, hooliganism was rife, and English clubs had been banned from European competition for five years following the Heysel Stadium disaster between the fans of Liverpool Football Club and the fans of Juventus in 1985.[19] The Football League First Division, the top level of English football since 1888, was behind leagues such as Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga in attendance and revenues, and several top English players had moved abroad.[20] By the turn of the 1990s, the downward trend was starting to reverse. At the 1990 FIFA World Cup, England reached the semi-finals; UEFA, European football's governing body, lifted the five-year ban on English clubs playing in European competitions in 1990, resulting in Manchester United lifting the Cup Winners' Cup in 1991. The Taylor Report on stadium safety standards, which proposed expensive upgrades to create all-seater stadiums in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster; between the fans of Liverpool and the fans of Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield, Yorkshire on 15 April 1989, was published in January 1990.[21] During the 1980s, major English clubs began to transform into business ventures, applying commercial principles to club administration to maximise revenue. Martin Edwards of Manchester United, Irving Scholar of Tottenham Hotspur, and David Dein of Arsenal were among the leaders in this transformation.[22] The commercial imperative led to the top clubs seeking to increase their power and revenue: the clubs in Division One threatened to break away from the Football League, and in doing so, they managed to increase their voting power and gain a more favourable financial arrangement, taking a 50% share of all television and sponsorship income in 1986.[22] They demanded that television companies should pay more for their coverage of football matches,[23] and revenue from television grew in importance. The Football League received Â£6.3 million for a two-year agreement in 1986, but by 1988, in a deal agreed with ITV, the price rose to Â£44 million over four years, with the leading clubs taking 75% of the cash.[24][25] According to Scholar, who was involved in the negotiations of television deals, each of the First Division clubs received only around Â£25,000 per year from television rights before 1986, this increased to around Â£50,000 in the 1986 negotiation, then to Â£600,000 in 1988.[26] The 1988 negotiations were conducted under the threat of ten clubs leaving to form a \"super league\", but they were eventually persuaded to stay, with the top clubs taking the lion's share of the deal.[24][27][28] The negotiations also convinced the bigger clubs that, in order to receive enough votes, they needed to take the whole of the First Division with them instead of a smaller \"super league\".[29] By the beginning of the 1990s, the big clubs again considered breaking away, especially now that they had to fund the cost of stadium upgrades as proposed by the Taylor Report.[30] In 1990, the managing director of London Weekend Television (LWT), Greg Dyke, met with the representatives of the \"big five\" football clubs in England (Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur, Everton, and Arsenal) over a dinner.[31] The meeting was to pave the way for a breakaway from the Football League.[32] Dyke believed that it would be more lucrative for LWT if only the larger clubs in the country were featured on national television and wanted to establish whether the clubs would be interested in a larger share of television rights money.[33] The five clubs agreed with the suggestion and decided to press ahead with it; however, the league would have no credibility without the backing of the Football Association, and so David Dein of Arsenal held talks to see whether the FA were receptive to the idea. The FA did not have an amicable relationship with the Football League at the time and considered it a way to weaken the Football League's position.[34] The FA released a report in June 1991, Blueprint for the Future of Football, that supported the plan for the Premier League, with the FA as the ultimate authority that would oversee the breakaway league.[29] At the close of the 1990â1991 season, a proposal was tabled for the establishment of a new league that would bring more money into the game overall. The Founder Members Agreement, signed on 17 July 1991, by the game's top-flight clubs, established the basic principles for setting up the FA Premier League.[35] The newly formed top division was to have commercial independence from the Football Association and the Football League, giving the FA Premier League licence to negotiate its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements. The argument given at the time was that the extra income would allow English clubs to compete with teams across Europe.[20] Although Dyke played a significant role in the creation of the Premier League, he and ITV (of which LWT was part) lost out in the bidding for broadcast rights: BSkyB won with a bid of Â£304 million over five years, with the BBC awarded the highlights package broadcast on Match of the Day.[31][33] Luton Town, Notts County, and West Ham United were the three teams relegated from the old First Division at the end of the 1991â92 season, and did not take part in the inaugural Premier League season. They were replaced by Ipswich Town, Middlesbrough, and Blackburn Rovers, promoted from the old Second Division.[36] The 22 First Division clubs resigned en masse from the Football League in 1992, and on 27 May that year, the FA Premier League was formed as a limited company, working out of an office at the Football Association's then headquarters in Lancaster Gate.[20] The 22 inaugural members of the new Premier League were:[37] This meant a break-up of the 104-year-old Football League that had operated until then with four divisions; the Premier League would operate with a single division and the Football League with three. There was no change in competition format; the same number of teams competed in the top flight, and promotion and relegation between the Premier League and the new First Division remained the same as the old First and Second Divisions, with three teams relegated from the league and three promoted.[28] The league held its first season in 1992â93. It was composed of 22 clubs for that season (reduced to 20 in the 1995â96 season). The first Premier League goal was scored by Brian Deane of Sheffield United in a 2â1 win against Manchester United.[38] Manchester United won the inaugural edition of the new league, ending a twenty-six year wait to be crowned champions of England. Bolstered by this breakthrough, United immediately became the competition's dominant team, winning seven of the first nine trophies, two League and FA Cup 'doubles' and a European treble, initially under a team of hardened veterans such as Bryan Robson, Steve Bruce, Paul Ince, Mark Hughes, and Eric Cantona, before Cantona, Bruce, and Roy Keane led a young, dynamic new team filled with the Class of 92, a group of young players including David Beckham who came through the Manchester United Academy. Between 1993 and 1997, Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United came close to challenging Manchester United's early dominance; Blackburn won the 1994â95 FA Premier League and Newcastle led the title charge over United for much of the 1995â96 season. As the decade closed, Arsenal replicated Manchester United's dominance by winning the League and FA Cup double in 1997â98, and together they would form a duopoly over the league between 1997 and 2003. The 2000s saw the rise of Liverpool alongside the \"Big 2\", followed by Chelsea finally breaking the ArsenalâMan United duopoly by winning the league in 2004â05. The dominance of the so-called \"Big Four\" clubs â Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, and Manchester United[39][40] â saw them finish at the top of the table for most of the decade, thereby guaranteeing qualification for the UEFA Champions League. Only three other clubs managed to qualify for the competition during this period: Newcastle United (2001â02 and 2002â03), Everton (2004â05), and Tottenham Hotspur (2009â10) â each occupying the final Champions League spot, with the exception of Newcastle in the 2002â03 season, who finished third. Following the 2003â04 season, Arsenal acquired the nickname \"The Invincibles\" as they became the first and, to date, only club to complete a Premier League campaign without losing a single game.[41][42] In May 2008, Kevin Keegan stated that \"Big Four\" dominance threatened the division: \"This league is in danger of becoming one of the most boring but great leagues in the world.\"[43] Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said in defence: \"There are a lot of different tussles that go on in the Premier League depending on whether you're at the top, in the middle, or at the bottom that make it interesting.\"[44] Between 2005 and 2012, there was a Premier League representative in seven of the eight Champions League finals, with only the \"Big Four\" clubs reaching that stage. Liverpool (2005), Manchester United (2008), and Chelsea (2012) won the competition during this period, with Arsenal (2006), Liverpool (2007), Chelsea (2008), and Manchester United (2009 and 2011) all losing Champions League finals.[45] Leeds United were the only non-\"Big Four\" side to reach the semi-finals of the Champions League, in the 2000â01 season. There were three Premier League teams in the Champions League semi-finals in 2006â07, 2007â08, and 2008â09, a feat only ever achieved five times (along with Serie A in 2002â03 and La Liga in 1999â2000). Additionally, between the 1999â2000 and 2009â10 seasons, four Premier League sides reached the UEFA Cup or Europa League finals, with only Liverpool managing to win the competition in 2001. Arsenal (2000), Middlesbrough (2006), and Fulham (2010) all lost their finals.[46] Although the group's dominance was reduced to a degree after this period with the emergence of Manchester City and Tottenham, in terms of all-time Premier League points won, they remain clear by some margin. As of the end of the 2021â22 season â the 30th season of the Premier League â Liverpool, in fourth place in the all-time points table, were over 300 points ahead of the next team, Tottenham Hotspur. They are also the only teams to maintain a winning average of over 50% throughout their entire Premier League tenures.[47] The years following 2009 marked a shift from the \"Big Four\" with Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City breaking into the top four places on a regular basis, turning the \"Big Four\" into the \"Big Six\".[48] In the 2009â10 season, Tottenham finished fourth and became the first new team to finish in the top four since Everton five years prior.[49] Criticism of the gap between an elite group of \"super clubs\" and the majority of the Premier League has continued, nevertheless, due to their increasing ability to spend more than the other Premier League clubs.[50] Manchester City won the title in the 2011â12 season, becoming the first club outside the \"Big Four\" to win since Blackburn Rovers in the 1994â95 season. That season also saw two of the \"Big Four\" (Chelsea and Liverpool) finish outside the top four places for the first time since that season.[48] With only four UEFA Champions League qualifying places available in the league, greater competition for qualification now exists, albeit from a narrow base of six clubs. In the five seasons following the 2011â12 campaign, Manchester United and Liverpool both found themselves outside of the top four three times, whilst Chelsea finished 10th in the 2015â16 season. Arsenal finished 5th in 2016â17, ending their record run of 20 consecutive top-four finishes.[51] In the 2015â16 season, underdogs Leicester City won the Premier League. With 5000/1 odds of winning the league at the beginning of the season, Leicester became the first club outside the \"Big Six\" to win the Premier League since Blackburn Rovers in the 1994â95 season.[52] Off the pitch, the \"Big Six\" wield significant financial power and influence, with these clubs arguing that they should be entitled to a greater share of revenue due to the greater stature of their clubs globally and the attractive football they aim to play.[53] Objectors argue that the egalitarian revenue structure in the Premier League helps to maintain a competitive league which is vital for its future success.[54] The 2016â17 Deloitte Football Money League report showed the financial disparity between the \"Big Six\" and the rest of the division. All of the \"Big Six\" had revenues greater than â¬350 million, with Manchester United having the largest revenue in the league at â¬676.3 million. Leicester City was the closest club to the \"Big Six\" in terms of revenue, recording a figure of â¬271.1 million for that season â helped by participation in the Champions League. The eighth-largest revenue generator, West Ham â who did not play in European competition â had revenues of â¬213.3 million, less than half of those of the club with the fifth-largest revenue, Liverpool (â¬424.2 million).[55] A substantial part of the clubs' revenue by then came from television broadcast deals, with the biggest clubs each taking from around Â£150 million to nearly Â£200 million in the 2016â17 season from such deals.[56] In Deloitte's 2019 report, all the \"Big Six\" were in the top ten of the world's richest clubs.[57] From the 2019â20 season, video assistant referees were used in the league.[58] The 2019â20 season saw Liverpool win their first Premier League trophy, their first top-flight trophy in 30 years.[59] Project Big Picture was announced in October 2020 that described a plan to reunite the top Premier League clubs with the English Football League, proposed by leading Premier League clubs Manchester United and Liverpool.[60] It has been criticised by the Premier League leadership and the UK government's Department for Culture, Media and Sport.[61] On 26 April 2021, play was stopped during a match between Leicester City and Crystal Palace to allow players Wesley Fofana and Cheikhou KouyatÃ© to break Ramadan fast. It is believed to be the first time in Premier League history that a game was paused to allow Muslim players to eat and drink after the sun had set in accordance with the rules of the faith.[62] The 2022â23 season was the first to take a six-week break between November and December 2022 to allow for the first winter World Cup,[63] with a return for the Boxing Day fixtures.[64] The Premier League players decided to take the knee at selected \"significant moments\". They assured to \"remain resolutely committed to eradicate racial prejudice\".[65] That season was notable for Newcastle United and Brighton & Hove Albion breaking the traditional \"Big Six\" as they finished fourth and sixth, respectively, whilst \"Big Six\" teams Tottenham and Chelsea finished eighth and twelfth.[66][67] Meanwhile, 2015â16 champions Leicester City were relegated, becoming the second league-winning club to suffer relegation since 1992, after Blackburn Rovers in the 2011â12 season.[68] In the 2023â24 season, Manchester City won the Premier League for the sixth time in seven years to become the first top-flight team to win four consecutive league titles in English football history.[69] Meanwhile, non-Big Six club Aston Villa finished fourth and qualified for the 2024â25 UEFA Champions League.[70] The Football Association Premier League Ltd (FAPL)[71][72][73] is operated as a corporation and is owned by the 20 member clubs. Each club is a shareholder, with one vote each on issues such as rule changes and contracts. The clubs select a chairman, chief executive, and board of directors to oversee the daily operations of the league.[74] The Football Association is not directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the Premier League, but has veto power as a special shareholder during the election of the chairman and chief executive and when new rules are adopted by the league.[75] The current chief executive is Richard Masters, who was appointed in December 2019.[76] The chair is currently Alison Brittain, who took over the role in early 2023.[77] The Premier League sends representatives to UEFA's European Club Association, the number of clubs and the clubs themselves chosen according to UEFA coefficients. For the 2023â24 season, the Premier League has 13 representatives in the Association: Arsenal, Aston Villa, Brighton & Hove Albion, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Newcastle United, Nottingham Forest, Tottenham Hotspur, West Ham United, and Wolverhampton Wanderers.[78] The European Club Association is responsible for electing three members to UEFA's Club Competitions Committee, which is involved in the operations of UEFA competitions such as the Champions League and UEFA Europa League.[79] The Premier League has faced criticism of its governance due to an alleged lack of transparency and accountability. Following the Premier League's blocking of the attempted takeover of Newcastle United by a PIF-backed consortium through the league's Owners' and Directors' test, many MPs, Newcastle United fans and related parties to the deal denounced the Premier League for its perceived lack of transparency and accountability throughout the process.[80][81][82] On 6 July 2021, consortium member Amanda Staveley of PCP Capital Partners said that \"fans surely deserve absolute transparency from the regulators across all their processes â to best ensure that they act responsibly. They (the Premier League) are performing a function like that of a government regulator â but without the same systems for accountability.\"[82] On 22 July 2021, Tracey Crouch MP â chair of the fan-led review into the UK's football governance â announced in the review's interim findings that the Premier League had \"lost the trust and confidence\" of fans. The review also recommended that a new independent regulator be created to oversee matters such as club takeovers.[83][84] Premier League chief executive Richard Masters had earlier spoken out against the implementation of an independent regulator, saying in May 2021, \"I don't think that the independent regulator is the answer to the question. I would defend the Premier League's role as regulator of its clubs over the past 30 years.\"[85] [The Premier League] is very tough and is different. If you compare this league to another league, it's like playing another sport. In [The Premier League] you never really know what is going to happen, there is very little between the teams. There are 20 clubs in the Premier League. During the course of a season (from August to May) each club plays the others twice (a double round-robin system), once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents, for 38 games. Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw. No points are awarded for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, then goal difference, and then goals scored. If still equal, teams are deemed to occupy the same position. If there is a tie for the championship, for relegation, or for qualification to other competitions, the head-to-head record between the tied teams is taken into consideration (points scored in the matches between the teams, followed by away goals in those matches.) If two teams are still tied, a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank.[88] A system of promotion and relegation exists between the Premier League and the EFL Championship. The three lowest placed teams in the Premier League are relegated to the Championship, and the top two teams from the Championship promoted to the Premier League,[89] with an additional team promoted after a series of play-offs involving the third, fourth, fifth and sixth placed clubs.[90] The number of clubs was reduced from 22 to 20 in 1995, when four teams were relegated from the league and only two teams promoted.[91][92] The top flight had only been expanded to 22 teams at the start of the 1991â92 season â the year prior to the formation of the Premier League.[92] On 8 June 2006, FIFA requested that all major European leagues, including Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga, be reduced to 18 teams by the start of the 2007â08 season. The Premier League responded by announcing their intention to resist such a reduction.[93] Ultimately, the 2007â08 season kicked off again with 20 teams.[94] Video assistant referee (VAR), was introduced to the Premier League at the beginning of the 2019â20 season. It uses technology and officials to assist the referee in making decisions on the pitch.[95] However, its use has been met with mixed receptions from fans and pundits, with some praising its accuracy whilst others criticise its impact on the flow of the game and consistency of decision-making. The on-field referee still makes the final decision, but VAR can assist the referee in the decision-making process. VAR can only be used for four types of decisions: goals, penalty decisions, direct red card incidents, and cases of mistaken identity. VAR officials review the video footage and communicate with the on-field referee via a headset. The VAR officials are located in a central control room, which is equipped with multiple camera angles and the ability to replay footage at various speeds. A study evaluating fan reception of VAR in the Premier League was made by Otto Kolbinger and Melanie Knopp and was done by analysing Twitter data.[96] The researchers used sentiment analysis to measure the overall positive or negative attitudes towards VAR, as well as topic modelling to identify specific issues that fans are discussing related to VAR. The study found that the reception of VAR on Twitter is largely negative, with fans expressing frustration and criticism of the technology's impact on the flow of the game and the inconsistency of decisions. The researchers also identified specific issues, such as handball and offside decisions, that fans are particularly critical of. The study concludes that VAR has not been well received by fans in the Premier League, and that efforts to improve the technology and increase transparency in decision-making are needed to address these concerns. Fifty-one clubs have played in the Premier League from its inception in 1992, up to and including the 2023â24 season.[97] Titles won by club (%) Italics indicate former Premier League champions that are currently outside the Premier League. Twenty clubs are competing in the 2024â25 season â top seventeen from the previous season and three promoted from the Championship. In 2011, after Swansea City gained promotion, a Welsh club participated in the Premier League for the first time.[98][99] The first Premier League match to be played outside England was Swansea City's home match at Liberty Stadium against Wigan Athletic on 20 August 2011.[100] The number of Welsh clubs in the Premier League increased to two in 2013â14, as Cardiff City gained promotion,[101] but they were relegated after their maiden season.[102] Cardiff were promoted again in 2017â18 but the number of Welsh clubs remained the same for the 2018â19 Premier League season, as Swansea City had been relegated from the Premier League in 2017â18.[103] Following Cardiff City's relegation after the 2018â19 season, there are currently no Welsh clubs participating in the Premier League.[104] Because they are members of the Football Association of Wales (FAW), the question of whether clubs like Swansea should represent England or Wales in European competitions has caused long-running discussions in UEFA. Swansea took one of England's three available places in the Europa League in 2013â14 by winning the League Cup in 2012â13.[105] The right of Welsh clubs to take up such English places was in doubt until UEFA clarified the matter in March 2012, allowing them to participate.[106] Participation in the Premier League by some Scottish or Irish clubs has sometimes been discussed, but without result. The idea came closest to reality in 1998, when Wimbledon received Premier League approval to relocate to Dublin, Ireland, but the move was blocked by the Football Association of Ireland.[107][108][109][110] Additionally, the media occasionally discusses the idea that Scotland's two biggest teams, Celtic and Rangers, should or will take part in the Premier League, but nothing has come of these discussions.[111] The top four teams in the Premier League qualify automatically for the subsequent season's UEFA Champions League league phase. The champions of the Champions League and UEFA Europa League may earn an additional qualification for the subsequent season's Champions League league phase if did not finish in the top four. If this means six Premier League teams qualify, then the fourth-placed team in the Premier League is instead entered in the Europa League, as any single nation is limited to a maximum of five teams in the Champions League. However, starting from the 2024â25 UEFA Champions League there are additional berths for the two best associations in the previous season's ranking, which may result in a maximum of six teams from one association in the Champions League. The fifth-placed team in the Premier League, as well as the winners of the FA Cup, qualify for the subsequent season's Europa League league phase, but if the winner of the FA Cup also finishes in the top five places in the Premier League or has won one of UEFA's major tournaments, then this place reverts to the team that finished sixth. The winner of the EFL Cup qualifies for the subsequent season's UEFA Conference League, but if the winner had already qualified for a UEFA competition via their performance in another competition, then this place reverts to the team that finished sixth in the Premier League, or seventh if the FA Cup result had already caused the sixth-placed team to qualify.[112] The number of places allocated to English clubs in UEFA competitions is dependent upon the position the country holds in the UEFA coefficient rankings, which are calculated based on the performance of teams in UEFA competitions over the previous five years. Currently, England is ranked first, ahead of Spain. As of 26 September 2024, the coefficients for are as follows (only top five European leagues are shown):[113][114] An exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions League the season before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers.[115] The governing body subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that if the Champions League winners finished outside the top four in its domestic league, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team. At that time, no association could have more than four entrants in the Champions League.[116] This occurred in 2012, when Chelsea â who had won the Champions League that summer, but finished sixth in the league â qualified for the 2012â13 Champions League in place of Tottenham Hotspur, who went into the Europa League.[117] From 2015â16, the Europa League champions qualify for the Champions League, increasing the maximum number of participants per country to five.[118] This took effect in England in 2016â17, when Manchester United finished sixth in the Premier League and won the Europa League, giving England five Champions League entrants for 2017â18.[119] In these instances, any Europa League berth vacated is not handed down to the next-best Premier League finisher outside of a qualifying place. If both Champions League and Europa League winners are of the same association and both finish outside the top four, then the fourth-placed team is transferred to the Europa League. With 48 continental trophies won, English clubs are the third-most successful in European football, behind Italy (50) and Spain (67). In the top-tier UEFA Champions League, a record six English clubs have won a total of 15 titles and lost a further 11 finals, behind Spanish clubs with 20 and 11, respectively.[120] In the second-tier UEFA Europa League, English clubs are third, with nine victories and eight losses in the finals.[121] In the former second-tier UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, English teams won a record eight titles and had a further five finalists.[122] In the non-UEFA organised Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, English clubs provided four winners and four runners-up, the second-most behind Spain with six and three, respectively.[123] In the newly created third-tier UEFA Conference League, English clubs have won a joint-record one title so far.[124] In the former fourth-tier UEFA Intertoto Cup, England won four titles and had a further final appearance, placing it fifth in the rankings, although English clubs were notorious for treating the tournament with disdain, either sending \"B\" squads or withdrawing from it altogether.[125][126][127] In the one-off UEFA Super Cup, England has ten winners and ten runners-up, the second-most behind Spain with 17 and 15, respectively.[128] Similarly to the Intertoto Cup, English teams did not take the former Intercontinental Cup seriously enough, despite its international status of the Club World Championship. They a made a total of six appearances in the one-off competition, winning only one of them, and withdrew a further three times.[129] English clubs have won the FIFA-organised Club World Cup four times, tied for the second-most with Brazil, and behind only Spain, with eight.[130][127] After an inaugural season with no sponsorship, the Premier League was sponsored by Carling from 1993 until 2001, during which time it was known as the FA Carling Premiership. In 2001, a new sponsorship deal with Barclaycard saw the league rebranded the FA Barclaycard Premiership, which was changed to the FA Barclays Premiership in time for the 2004â05 season. For the 2007â08 season, the league was rebranded the Barclays Premier League.[131][132] Barclays' deal with the Premier League expired at the end of the 2015â16 season. The organisation announced on 4 June 2015 that it would not pursue any further title sponsorship deals for the Premier League, arguing that they wanted to build a \"clean\" brand for the competition more in line with those of major U.S. sports leagues.[134] As well as sponsorship for the league itself, the Premier League has a number of official partners and suppliers.[135] The official ball supplier for the league is Nike who have had the contract since the 2000â01 season when they took over from Mitre.[136] Under its Merlin brand, Topps held the licence to produce collectables for the Premier League between 1994 and 2019 including stickers (for their sticker album) and trading cards.[137] Launched in the 2007â08 season, Topps' Match Attax, the official Premier League trading card game, is the best selling boys collectable in the UK, and is also the biggest selling sports trading card game in the world.[137][138] In October 2018, Panini were awarded the licence to produce collectables from the 2019â20 season.[139] The chocolate company Cadbury has been the official snack partner of the Premier League since 2017, and sponsored the Golden Boot, Golden Glove and Playmaker of the Season awards from the 2017â18 season to 2019â20 season.[140][141] The Coca-Cola Company (under its Coca-Cola Zero Sugar product line) sponsored these awards during the 2020â21 season with Castrol being the current sponsor as of the 2021â22 season.[142] The Premier League has the highest revenue of any association football league in the world, with total club revenues of â¬2.48 billion in 2009â10.[143][144] In 2013â14, due to improved television revenues and cost controls, the Premier League clubs collectively made a net profit in excess of Â£78 million, exceeding all other football leagues.[145] In 2010 the Premier League was awarded the Queen's Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category for its outstanding contribution to international trade and the value it brings to English football and the United Kingdom's broadcasting industry.[146] The Premier League includes some of the richest football clubs in the world. Deloitte's \"Football Money League\" listed seven Premier League clubs in the top 20 for the 2009â10 season,[147] and all 20 clubs were in the top 40 globally by the end of the 2013â14 season, largely as a result of increased broadcasting revenue.[148] In 2019, the league generated around Â£3.1 billion per year in domestic and international television rights.[4] Premier League clubs agreed in principle in December 2012, to radical new cost controls. The two proposals consist of a break-even rule and a cap on the amount clubs can increase their wage bill by each season. With the new television deals on the horizon, momentum has been growing to find ways of preventing the majority of the cash going straight to players and agents.[149] Central payments for the 2016â17 season amounted to Â£2,398,515,773 across the 20 clubs, with each team receiving a flat participation fee of Â£35,301,989 and additional payments for TV broadcasts (Â£1,016,690 for general UK rights to match highlights, Â£1,136,083 for each live UK broadcast of their games and Â£39,090,596 for all overseas rights), commercial rights (a flat fee of Â£4,759,404) and a notional measure of \"merit\" which was based upon final league position.[8] The merit component was a nominal sum of Â£1,941,609 multiplied by each finishing place, counted from the foot of the table (e.g., Burnley finished 16th in May 2017, five places counting upwards, and received 5 Ã Â£1,941,609 = Â£9,708,045 merit payment).[8] Since its split with the Football League, established clubs in the Premier League have a funding disparity from counterparts in lower leagues. Revenue from television rights between the leagues has played a part in this.[150] Promoted teams have found it difficult to avoid relegation in their first Premier League season. One Premier League newcomer has been relegated back to the Football League every season, save the 2001â02, 2011â12, 2017â18 & 2022â23 seasons. In the 1997â98 and 2023â24 seasons, all three promoted clubs were relegated by the season's end.[151] The Premier League distributes a portion of its television revenue as \"parachute payments\" to relegated clubs for adjustment to television revenue loss. The average Premier League team receives Â£41 million[152] whilst the average Championship club receives Â£2 million.[153] Starting with the 2013â14 season, these payments are in excess of Â£60 million over four seasons.[154] Critics maintain that the payments widen the gap between teams that have reached the Premier League and those that have not,[155] leading to the common occurrence of teams \"bouncing back\" soon after their relegation. Clubs which have failed to win immediate promotion back to the Premier League have seen financial problems, in some cases administration or liquidation. Further relegations down the footballing ladder have occurred for multiple clubs unable to cope with the gap.[156][157] Television has played a major role in the history of the Premier League. The League's decision to assign broadcasting rights to Sky in 1992 was at the time a radical decision, but one that has paid off. At the time, paid television was an almost untested proposition in the UK market as was charging fans to watch live televised football. However, a combination of Sky's strategy, the quality of Premier League football and the public's appetite for the game has seen the value of the Premier League's TV rights soar.[25] The Premier League sells its television rights on a collective basis. This is in contrast to some other European leagues, including La Liga, in which each club sells its rights individually, leading to a much higher share of the total income going to the top few clubs.[159] The money is divided into three parts:[160] half is divided equally between the clubs; one quarter is awarded on a merit basis based on final league position, the top club getting twenty times as much as the bottom club, and equal steps all the way down the table; the final quarter is paid out as facilities fees for games that are shown on television, with the top clubs generally receiving the largest shares of this. The income from overseas rights is divided equally between the twenty clubs.[161] Not all Premier League matches are televised in the United Kingdom, as the league upholds the long-standing prohibition on telecasts of any association football match (domestic or otherwise) that kicks off between 2:45 p.m. and 5:15 p.m. on Saturday matchdays.[162][163][164] The first Sky television rights agreement was worth Â£304 million over five seasons.[165] The next contract, negotiated to start from the 1997â98 season, rose to Â£670 million over four seasons.[165] The third contract was a Â£1.024 billion deal with BSkyB for the three seasons from 2001 to 2004. The league brought in Â£320 million from the sale of its international rights for the three-year period from 2004 to 2007. It sold the rights itself on a territory-by-territory basis.[166] Sky's monopoly was broken from August 2006 when Setanta Sports was awarded rights to show two out of the six packages of matches available. This occurred following an insistence by the European Commission that exclusive rights should not be sold to one television company. Sky and Setanta paid Â£1.7 billion, a two-thirds increase which took many commentators by surprise as it had been widely assumed that the value of the rights had levelled off following many years of rapid growth. Setanta also hold rights to a live 3 pm match solely for Irish viewers. The BBC retained the rights to show highlights for the same three seasons (on Match of the Day) for Â£171.6 million, a 63 per cent increase on the Â£105 million it paid for the previous three-year period.[167] Sky and BT Group (via its new channel BT Sport, now TNT Sports) agreed to jointly pay Â£84.3 million for delayed television rights to 242 games (that is the right to broadcast them in full on television and over the internet) in most cases for a period of 50 hours after 10 p.m. on matchday.[168] Overseas television rights fetched Â£625 million, nearly double the previous contract.[169] The total raised from those deals was more than Â£2.7 billion, giving Premier League clubs an average media income from league games of around Â£40 million-a-year from 2007 to 2010.[170] The TV rights agreement between the Premier League and Sky faced accusations of being a cartel, and a number of court cases arose as a result.[171] An investigation by the Office of Fair Trading in 2002 found BSkyB to be dominant within the pay TV sports market, but concluded that there were insufficient grounds for the claim that BSkyB had abused its dominant position.[172] In July 1999 the Premier League's method of selling rights collectively for all member clubs was investigated by the UK Restrictive Practices Court, which concluded that the agreement was not contrary to the public interest.[173] The BBC's highlights package on Saturday and Sunday nights, as well as other evenings when fixtures justify, ran until 2016.[174] Television rights alone for the period 2010 to 2013 were purchased for Â£1.782 billion.[175] On 22 June 2009, due to troubles encountered by Setanta Sports after it failed to meet a final deadline over a Â£30 million payment to the Premier League, ESPN was awarded two packages of UK rights containing 46 matches that were available for the 2009â10 season as well as a package of 23 matches per season from 2010 to 2013.[176] On 13 June 2012, the Premier League announced that BT had been awarded 38 games a season for the 2013â14, 2014â15 and 2015â16 seasons at Â£246 million-a-year. The remaining 116 games were retained by Sky, which paid Â£760 million-a-year. The total domestic rights raised Â£3.018 billion, an increase of 70.2% over the 2010â11 to 2012â13 rights.[177] The value of the licensing deal rose by another 70.2% in 2015, when Sky and BT paid Â£5.136 billion to renew their contracts with the Premier League for another three years up to the 2018â19 season.[178] A new rights cycle began in the 2019â20 season, with the domestic package increasing to 200 matches overall; in February 2018, BT were awarded the package of 32 lunchtime fixtures on Saturdays, whilst Sky was awarded four of the seven packages, covering the majority of weekend fixtures (including eight new prime time fixtures on Saturdays), as well as Monday and Friday matches. Two remaining packages of 20 fixtures each were to be sold at a later date, including three rounds of mid-week fixtures and a bank holiday round. As Sky already owned the maximum number of matches it could hold without breaching a 148-match cap, it was speculated that at least one of the new packages could go to a new entrant, such as a streaming service. The five packages sold to BT and Sky were valued at Â£4.464 billion.[179] In June 2018, it was announced that Amazon Prime Video and BT had acquired the remaining two packages; Amazon acquired rights to 20 matches per-season, covering a mid-week round in December, and all Boxing Day fixtures.[180] The Amazon telecasts are produced in association with Sunset + Vine and BT Sport.[181] With the resumption of play in the 2019â20 Premier League due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, the Premier League announced that all remaining matches would be carried on British television, split primarily across Sky, BT, and Amazon. A large number of these matches were also scheduled for free-to-air broadcasts, with Sky airing 25 on Pick, Amazon streaming its four matches on Twitch, and the BBC â for the first time in league history â carrying four live matches.[182][183][184][185] As matches would continue to be played without spectators upon the start of the 2020â21 Premier League, its clubs voted on 8 September to continue broadcasting all matches through at least September (with the BBC and Amazon each holding one additional match), and \"appropriate arrangements\" being made for October.[186][187] It was later announced that matches not selected for broadcast would be carried on pay-per-view via BT Sport Box Office and Sky Box Office at a cost of Â£14.95 per-match. The PPV scheme was poorly received; the Football Supporters' Federation felt that the price was too high, and there were concerns that it could encourage piracy. There were calls from supporters to boycott the pay-per-views, and make donations to support charitable causes instead (with Newcastle's \"Charity Not PPV\" campaign raising Â£20,000 for a local food bank, and Arsenal fans raising Â£34,000 for Islington Giving). On 13 November, amid the reintroduction of measures across the UK, the Premier League officially announced that the non-televised matches would be assigned to its main broadcast partners, and again including additional matches for the BBC and Amazon Prime.[188][189][190][191] The next cycle of rights between 2022â23 and 2024â25 season was renewed without tender due to compelling and exceptional circumstances in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, rights remained as they were since the 2019â20 season.[192] UK highlights In August 2016, it was announced the BBC would be creating a new magazine-style show for the Premier League entitled The Premier League Show.[193] The Premier League is the most-watched football league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people.[9] The Premier League's production arm, Premier League Productions, is operated by IMG Productions and produces content for its international television partners.[194] On 22 November 2024, the Premier League announced plans to end its agreement with IMG and take Premier League Productions in-house beginning in 2026â27.[195] The Premier League is the most widely distributed sports programme in Asia.[196] In the Indian subcontinent, the matches are broadcast live on STAR Sports.[197] In MENA region, BeIN Sports holds exclusive rights to the Premier League.[198] In China, the broadcast rights were awarded to iQiyi, Migu and CCTV that began in the 2021â22 season.[199][200][201] SCTV broadcast the matches for Indonesia, and Astro for Malaysia. In Australia, Optus telecommunications holds exclusive rights to the Premier League, providing live broadcasts and online access (Fox Sports formerly held rights).[202] As of the 2022â23 season, Canadian media rights to the Premier League are owned by FuboTV,[203] after having been jointly owned by Sportsnet and TSN, and most recently DAZN.[204] The Premier League is broadcast in the United States by NBC Sports, a division of Sky parent Comcast.[205] Acquiring the rights to the Premier League in 2013 (replacing Fox Soccer and ESPN), NBC Sports has been widely praised for its coverage.[206][207][208] NBC Sports reached a six-year extension with the Premier League in 2015 to broadcast the league until the end of the 2021â22 season in a deal valued at $1 billion (Â£640 million).[209][210] In November 2021, NBC reached another six-year extension through 2028 in a deal valued at $2.76 billion (Â£2 billion).[211][212] The Premier League is broadcast by SuperSport across sub-Saharan Africa.[213] Broadcasters to continental Europe until 2025 include Canal+ for France,[214] Sky Sport Germany for Germany and Austria,[215] Match TV for Russia,[216] Sky Sport Italy for Italy,[217] Eleven Sports for Portugal,[218] DAZN for Spain,[219] beIN Sports Turkey to Turkey,[220] Digi Sport for Romania,[221] and NENT to Nordic countries (Sweden, Denmark and Norway),[222] Poland and the Netherlands.[223] In South America, ESPN covers much of the continent,[224] with coverage in Brazil shared between ESPN Brasil and ESPN4.[225][226] Paramount+ broadcasts the league in Central America.[227] As of the 2023â24 season, Premier League football has been played in 61 stadiums since the formation of the division.[228] The Hillsborough disaster in 1989 and the subsequent Taylor Report saw a recommendation that standing terraces should be abolished. As a result, all stadiums in the Premier League are all-seater.[229][230] Since the formation of the Premier League, football grounds in England have seen constant improvements to capacity and facilities, with some clubs moving to new-build stadiums.[231] Eleven stadiums that have seen Premier League football have now been demolished. The stadiums for the 2023â24 season show a large disparity in capacity. For example, Old Trafford, the home of Manchester United, has a capacity of 74,031 whilst Dean Court, the home of Bournemouth, has a capacity of 11,307. The combined total capacity of the Premier League in the 2023â24 season is 787,002 with an average capacity of 39,350. Stadium attendances are a significant source of regular income for Premier League clubs.[232] For the 2022â23 season, average attendances across the league clubs were 40,235 for Premier League matches with an aggregate attendance of 15,289,340.[233] This represents an increase of 19,109 from the average attendance of 21,126 recorded in the Premier League's first season (1992â93).[234] However, during the 1992â93 season, the capacities of most stadiums were reduced as clubs replaced terraces with seats in order to meet the Taylor Report's 1994â95 deadline for all-seater stadiums.[235][236] The 2022â23 season also set a competition record for total attendance with more than 15 million spectators, with average attendance also reaching record levels, surpassing the previous record of 39,989 set in the 2021â22 season, which in turn broke over 70 years old record set in 1948â49 season.[237] In October 2024 it was reported that the government is planning to grant the independent regulator authority to stop Premier League clubs from selling their stadiums to affiliated or third-party companies.[238] I have never known this level before. Of course, there are managers in Germany, Italy, and Spain, but in the Premier League, these are the best managers, the elite managers. The quality, the preparation. The level is so high. Managers in the Premier League are involved in the day-to-day running of the team, including the training, team selection and player acquisition. Their influence varies from club-to-club and is related to the ownership of the club and the relationship of the manager with fans.[240] Managers are required to have a UEFA Pro Licence which is the final coaching qualification available, and follows the completion of the UEFA 'B' and 'A' Licences.[241] The UEFA Pro Licence is required by every person who wishes to manage a club in the Premier League on a permanent basis (i.e., more than 12 weeks, the amount of time an unqualified caretaker manager is allowed to take control).[242] Caretaker appointments are managers that fill the gap between a managerial departure and a new appointment. Several caretaker managers have gone on to secure a permanent managerial post after performing well as a caretaker, including Paul Hart at Portsmouth, David Pleat at Tottenham Hotspur and Ole Gunnar SolskjÃ¦r at Manchester United. ArsÃ¨ne Wenger is the longest-serving manager, having been in charge of Arsenal in the Premier League from 1996 to his departure at the conclusion of the 2017â18 season, and holds the record for most matches managed in the Premier League with 828, all with Arsenal. He broke the record set by Alex Ferguson, who had managed 810 matches with Manchester United from the Premier League's inception to his retirement at the end of the 2012â13 season. Ferguson was in charge of Manchester United from November 1986 until his retirement at the end of the 2012â13 season, meaning he was manager for the last five years of the old Football League First Division and all of the first 21 seasons of the Premier League.[243] Notably, since its creation the Premier League has never been won by an English manager. There have been several studies into the reasoning behind, and effects of, managerial sackings. Most famously, Sue Bridgewater of the University of Liverpool and Bas ter Weel of the University of Amsterdam, performed two separate studies which helped to explain the statistics behind managerial sackings. Bridgewater's study found clubs generally sack their managers upon dropping below an average of one point per match.[244] Player transfers may only take place within transfer windows set by the Football Association. The two transfer windows run from the last day of the season to 31 August and from 31 December to 31 January. Player registrations cannot be exchanged outside these windows except under specific licence from the FA, usually on an emergency basis.[246] As of the 2010â11 season, the Premier League introduced new rules mandating that each club must register a maximum 25-man squad of players aged over 21, with the squad list only allowed to be changed in transfer windows or in exceptional circumstances.[247][248] This was to enable the \"home grown\" rule to be enacted, whereby the Premier League would also from 2010 require at least eight members of the named 25-man squad to be \"home-grown players\".[247] At the inception of the Premier League in 1992â93, just 11 players named in the starting line-ups for the first round of matches hailed from outside of the United Kingdom or Ireland.[249] By 2000â01, the number of foreign players participating in the Premier League was 36% of the total. In the 2004â05 season, the figure had increased to 45%. On 26 December 1999, Chelsea became the first Premier League side to field an entirely foreign starting line-up,[250] and on 14 February 2005, Arsenal were the first to name a completely foreign 16-man squad for a match.[251] By 2009, under 40% of the players in the Premier League were English.[252] By February 2020, 117 different nationalities had played in the Premier League, and 101 nationalities had scored in the competition.[253] In 1999, in response to concerns that clubs were increasingly passing over young English players in favour of foreign players, the Home Office tightened its rules for granting work permits to players from countries outside of the European Union.[254] A non-EU player applying for the permit must have played for his country in at least 75 per cent of its competitive 'A' team matches for which he was available for selection during the previous two years, and his country must have averaged at least 70th place in the official FIFA world rankings over the previous two years. If a player does not meet those criteria, the club wishing to sign him may appeal.[255] Following the implementation of Brexit in January 2021, new regulations were introduced which require all foreign players to obtain a Governing Body Endorsement (GBE) in order to play football in the United Kingdom, regardless of EU status.[256] Italics denotes players still playing professional football,Bold denotes players still playing in the Premier League. The Premier League Golden Boot is awarded each season to the top scorer in the division. Former Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United striker Alan Shearer holds the record for most Premier League goals with 260.[258] Thirty-three players have reached the 100-goal mark.[259] Since the first Premier League season in 1992â93, 23 players from 11 clubs have won or shared the top scorer title.[260] Thierry Henry won his fourth overall scoring title by scoring 27 goals in the 2005â06 season. Erling Haaland holds the record for most goals in a Premier League season (38 matches) with 36 goals as of 15 May 2023.[261] Ryan Giggs of Manchester United holds the record for scoring goals in consecutive seasons, having scored in the first 21 seasons of the league.[262] Giggs also holds the record for the most Premier League assists, with 162.[263] There is no team or individual salary cap in the Premier League. As a result of the increasingly lucrative television deals, player wages rose sharply following the formation of the Premier League, when the average player wage was Â£75,000 per year.[264] In the 2018â19 season the average annual salary stood at Â£2.99 million. The total salary bill for the 20 Premier League clubs in the 2018â19 season was Â£1.62 billion; this compares to Â£1.05 billion in La Liga, Â£0.83 billion in Serie A, Â£0.72 billion in Bundesliga, and Â£0.54 billion in Ligue 1. The club with the highest average wage is Manchester United at Â£6.5 million. This is smaller than the club with the highest wage bill in Spain (Barcelona Â£10.5 million) and Italy (Juventus Â£6.7 million), but higher than in Germany (Bayern Munich Â£6.4 million) and France (Paris Saint-Germain Â£6.1 million). For the 2018â19 season, the ratio of the wages of the highest-paid team to lowest-paid in the Premier League is 6.82 to 1. This is much lower than in La Liga (19.1 to 1), Serie A (16 to 1), Bundesliga (20.5 to 1), and Ligue 1 (26.6 to 1). Because of the lower differential between team wage bills in the Premier League, it is often regarded as being more competitive than other top European leagues.[265] The record transfer fee for a Premier League player has risen steadily over the lifetime of the competition. Before the start of the first Premier League season, Alan Shearer became the first British player to command a transfer fee of more than Â£3 million.[266] The record has increased steadily and Enzo FernÃ¡ndez is now the most expensive transfer fee paid by a Premier League club at Â£106.8 million, whilst Philippe Coutinho is the biggest transfer involving a Premier League club at Â£105 million. The Premier League maintains two trophies â the genuine trophy (held by the reigning champions) and a spare replica. Two trophies are held for the purpose of making the award within minutes of the title being secured, in the event that on the final day of the season two clubs are still within reach of winning the League.[293] In the rare event that more than two clubs are vying for the title on the final day of the season, a replica won by a previous club is used.[294] The current Premier League trophy was created by Royal Jewellers Garrard & Co/Asprey of London and was designed in house at Garrard & Co by Trevor Brown and Paul Marsden. It consists of a trophy with a golden crown and a malachite plinth base. The plinth weighs 33 pounds (15 kg) and the trophy weighs 22 pounds (10.0 kg).[295] The trophy and plinth are 76 cm (30 in) tall, 43 cm (17 in) wide and 25 cm (9.8 in) deep.[296] Its main body is solid sterling silver and silver gilt, whilst its plinth is made of malachite, a semi-precious stone. The plinth has a silver band around its circumference, upon which the names of the title-winning clubs are listed. The green of the malachite represents the green field of play.[296] The design of the trophy is based on the heraldry of Three Lions that is associated with English football. Two of the lions are found above the handles on either side of the trophy â the third is symbolised by the captain of the title-winning team as he raises the trophy, and its gold crown, above his head at the end of the season.[297] The ribbons that drape the handles are presented in the team colours of the league champions that year. In 2004, a special gold version of the trophy was commissioned to commemorate Arsenal winning the title without a single defeat.[298] In addition to the winner's trophy and the individual winner's medals awarded to players who win the title, the Premier League also issues other awards throughout the season. A man-of-the-match award is awarded to the player who has the greatest impact in an individual match. Monthly awards are also given for the Manager of the Month, Player of the Month and Goal of the Month.[299] These are also issued annually for Manager of the Season,[300] Player of the Season[301] and Goal of the Season. The Young Player of the Season award is given to the most outstanding U-23 player starting from the 2019â20 season.[302] The Golden Boot award is given to the top goalscorer of every season, the Playmaker of the Season award is given to the player who makes the most assists of every season,[141] and the Golden Glove award is given to the goalkeeper with the most clean sheets at the end of the season.[303] Starting with the 2021â22 season, four new awards are given. The Save of the Season is awarded to the goalkeeper deemed to have made the most impressive save.[304] The Game Changer of the Season is earned by the player with the single most game-changing performance over the course of the campaign.[305] The Most Powerful Goal is given to the player whose goal-scoring shot had the highest average velocity from the time it was struck to the time it crossed the goal line, and the Most Improbable Comeback award is meant for the team that, based on calculations performed by Oracle Corporation, goes behind and overcomes a deficit to win their respective match.[306] From the 2017â18 season, players receive a milestone award for 100 appearances and every century there after and also players who score 50 goals and multiples thereof. Each player to reach these milestones is to receive a presentation box from the Premier League containing a special medallion and a plaque commemorating their achievement.[307] In 2012, the Premier League celebrated its second decade by holding the 20 Seasons Awards:[308] Bibliography",

                "content": "1943 due to loss of players during World War II (temporary merger with Philadelphia Eagles): 1944 due to loss of players during World War II (temporary merger with Chicago Cardinals): The Pittsburgh Steelers are a professional American football team based in Pittsburgh. The Steelers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) North division. Founded in 1933, the Steelers are the seventh-oldest franchise in the NFL, and the oldest franchise in the AFC.[6] In contrast with their status as perennial also-rans in the pre-merger NFL, where they were the oldest team never to have won a league championship, the Steelers of the post-merger (modern) era are among the most successful NFL franchises, especially during their dynasty in the 1970s.[7][8][9] The team is tied with the New England Patriots for the most Super Bowl titles at six, and they have both played in (16 times) and hosted (11 times) more conference championship games than any other team in the NFL. The Steelers have also won eight AFC championships, tied with the Denver Broncos, but behind the Patriots' record 11 AFC championships. The team is tied with the Broncos, Dallas Cowboys, and San Francisco 49ers for the second-most Super Bowl appearances with eight. The Steelers, whose history may be traced to a regional pro team that was established in the early 1920s, joined the NFL as the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 8, 1933. The team was owned by Art Rooney and took its original name from the baseball team of the same name, as was common practice for NFL teams at the time.[6] To distinguish them from the baseball team, local media took to calling the football team the Rooneymen, an unofficial nickname that persisted for decades after the team had adopted its current nickname. The ownership of the Steelers has remained within the Rooney family since the organization's founding.[10] Art Rooney's son, Dan Rooney, owned the team from 1988 until his death in 2017. Much control of the franchise has been given to Dan Rooney's son, Art Rooney II. The Steelers enjoy a large, widespread fanbase nicknamed Steeler Nation.[11] They currently play their home games at Acrisure Stadium on Pittsburgh's North Side in the North Shore neighborhood, which also hosts the University of Pittsburgh Panthers. Built in 2001 as Heinz Field, the stadium replaced Three Rivers Stadium, which had hosted the Steelers for 31 seasons. Prior to Three Rivers, the Steelers had played their games in Pitt Stadium and at Forbes Field. The Pittsburgh Steelers of the NFL first took to the field as the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 20, 1933, losing 23â2 to the New York Giants.[6] Through the 1930s, the Pirates never finished higher than second place in their division, or with a record better than .500 (1936).[12] Pittsburgh did make history in 1938 by signing Byron White, a future Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, to what was at the time the biggest contract in NFL history, but he played only one year with the Pirates before signing with the Detroit Lions.[6][13] Prior to the 1940 season, the Pirates renamed themselves the Steelers.[14] During World War II, the Steelers experienced player shortages. They twice merged with other NFL franchises to field a team. During the 1943 season, they merged with the Philadelphia Eagles forming the \"Phil-Pitt Eagles\" and were known as the \"Steagles\". This team went 5â4â1.[15] In 1944, they merged with the Chicago Cardinals and were known as Card-Pitt (or, mockingly, as the \"Carpets\").[6] This team finished 0â10, marking the only winless team in franchise history.[16] The Steelers made the playoffs for the first time in 1947, tying for first place in the division at 8â4 with the Philadelphia Eagles. This forced a tie-breaking playoff game at Forbes Field, which the Steelers lost 21â0.[17] That would be Pittsburgh's only playoff game in the pre-merger era; they did qualify for a \"Playoff Bowl\" in 1962 as the second-best team in their conference, but this was not considered an official playoff.[18] In 1970, the year they moved into Three Rivers Stadium and the year of the AFLâNFL merger, the Pittsburgh Steelers were one of three old-guard NFL teams to switch to the newly formed American Football Conference (the others being the Cleveland Browns and the Baltimore Colts), in order to equalize the number of teams in the two conferences of the newly merged league.[19] The Steelers also received a $3 million ($23.5 million today) relocation fee, which was a windfall for them; for years they rarely had enough to build a true contending team.[20] The Steelers' history of bad luck changed with the hiring of coach Chuck Noll from the NFL champion Baltimore Colts for the 1969 season.[21] Noll's most remarkable talent was in his draft selections, taking Hall of Famers \"Mean\" Joe Greene in 1969, Terry Bradshaw and Mel Blount in 1970, Jack Ham in 1971, Franco Harris in 1972,[22] and finally, in 1974, pulling off the incredible feat of selecting five Hall of Famers in one draft year, Lynn Swann, Jack Lambert, John Stallworth, Donnie Shell and Mike Webster.[23] The Pittsburgh Steelers' 1974 draft was their best ever; no other team has ever drafted five future Hall of Famers in one year, and only very few (including the 1970 Steelers) have drafted two or more in one year.[24] The players drafted in the early 1970s formed the base of an NFL dynasty, making the playoffs in eight seasons and becoming the only team in NFL history to win four Super Bowls in six years, as well as the first to win more than two.[25] They also enjoyed a regular-season streak of 49 consecutive wins (1971â1979) against teams that would finish with a losing record that year. The Steelers suffered a rash of injuries in the 1980 season and missed the playoffs with a 9â7 record.[26] The 1981 season was no better, with an 8â8 showing.[27] The team was then hit with the retirements of all their key players from the Super Bowl years. \"Mean\" Joe Greene retired after the 1981 season, Lynn Swann and Jack Ham after 1982's playoff berth, Terry Bradshaw and Mel Blount after 1983's divisional championship, and Jack Lambert after 1984's AFC Championship Game appearance.[28] After those retirements, the franchise skidded to its first losing seasons since 1971. Though still competitive, the Steelers would not finish above .500 in 1985, 1986, and 1988. In 1987, the year of the players' strike, the Steelers finished with a record of 8â7, but missed the playoffs.[29] In 1989, they would reach the second round of the playoffs on the strength of Merrill Hoge and Rod Woodson before narrowly missing the playoffs in each of the next two seasons, Noll's last seasons.[30] Noll's career record with Pittsburgh was 209â156â1.[31] In 1992, Chuck Noll retired and was succeeded by Kansas City Chiefs defensive coordinator Bill Cowher, a native of the Pittsburgh suburb of Crafton.[32] Cowher led the Steelers to the playoffs in each of his first six seasons, a feat that had been accomplished only by legendary coach Paul Brown of the Cleveland Browns. In those first six seasons, Cowher coached them as deep as the AFC Championship Game three times and following the 1995 season an appearance in Super Bowl XXX on the strength of the \"Blitzburgh\" defense. However, the Steelers lost to the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl XXX, two weeks after a thrilling AFC Championship victory over the Indianapolis Colts.[33][34] Cowher produced the franchise's record-tying fifth Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XL over the NFC champion Seattle Seahawks ten years later.[35] With that victory, the Steelers became the third team to win five Super Bowls, and the first sixth-seeded playoff team to reach and win the Super Bowl since the NFL expanded to a 12-team post-season tournament in 1990. He coached through the 2006 season which ended with an 8â8 record, just short of the playoffs. Overall Cowher's teams reached the playoffs 10 of 15 seasons with six AFC Championship Games, two Super Bowl berths and a championship. Cowher's career record with Pittsburgh was 149â90â1 in the regular season and 161â99â1 overall, including playoff games.[36] On January 7, 2007, Cowher resigned from coaching the Steelers, citing a need to spend more time with his family. He did not use the term \"retire\", leaving open a possible return to the NFL as coach of another team.[37] A three-man committee consisting of Art Rooney II, Dan Rooney, and Kevin Colbert was set up to conduct interviews for the head coaching vacancy.[38] On January 22, 2007, Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator Mike Tomlin was announced as Cowher's successor as head coach.[39] Tomlin is the first African-American to be named head coach of the team in its 75-year history.[40] In his first season, he led the Steelers to a 10â6 record and AFC North title.[41] The team fell to the Jacksonville Jaguars 31â29 in the Wild Card Round to end the season.[42] The following year, he led the Steelers to a 12â4 mark and a division title.[43] With wins over the San Diego Chargers in the Divisional Round and the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship,[44][45] Tomlin became the third consecutive Steelers Head Coach to go to the Super Bowl, equaling the Dallas Cowboys (Tom Landry, Jimmy Johnson and Barry Switzer) in this achievement. On February 1, 2009, Tomlin led the Steelers to their second Super Bowl of this decade, and went on to win 27â23 against the Arizona Cardinals.[46] At age 36, he was the youngest head coach to ever win the Super Bowl, and he is only the second African-American coach to ever win the Super Bowl (Tony Dungy was the first).[47] In their title defense, the Steelers went 9â7 and missed the postseason in the 2009 season.[48] In the 2010 season, Tomlin led the team to a 12â4 record and an AFC North title.[49] The team defeated the Baltimore Ravens in the Divisional Round and the New York Jets in the AFC Championship.[50][51] Tomlin became the only coach to reach the Super Bowl twice before the age of 40 as he took the team to Super Bowl XLV on February 6, 2011. However, the Steelers were defeated by the Green Bay Packers, 31â25.[52] In the 2011 season, the Steelers made the postseason with a 12â4 record. They lost in overtime to the Denver Broncos in the Wild Card Round.[53] The Steelers recorded their 400th victory in Week 8 of the 2012 season after defeating the Washington Redskins.[54] Overall, the Steelers went 8â8 and missed the postseason in 2012.[55] In the 2013 season, the Steelers went 8â8 and missed the postseason.[56] In the 2014 season, the Steelers won the AFC North with a 11â5 record.[57] They lost 30â17 to the Baltimore Ravens in the Wild Card Round.[58] The Steelers finished with a 10â6 record and made the playoffs in the 2015 season.[59] They defeated the Cincinnati Bengals in the Wild Card Round and lost to the Denver Broncos in the Divisional Round.[60][61] In the 2016 season, the Steelers won the AFC North with a 11â5 record.[62] They defeated the Miami Dolphins in the Wild Card Round and the Kansas City Chiefs in the Divisional Round before falling to the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship.[63][64][65] In the 2017 season, the Steelers won the AFC North with a 13â3 mark.[66] Their postseason was short lived with a 45â42 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars.[67] Despite a 9â6â1 record in the 2018 season, the Steelers missed the playoffs.[68] The Steelers went 8â8 and missed the postseason in the 2019 season.[69] The 2020 season saw the Steelers have franchise-best 11â0 start.[70] However, the team faded at the end of the season to finish 12â4.[71] The team lost in the Wild Card Round to the Cleveland Browns 48â37.[72] The 2021 season saw the team go 9â7â1 and make the postseason.[73] The Steelers lost 42â21 to the Kansas City Chiefs in the Wild Card Round.[74] Longtime quarterback Ben Roethlisberger retired following the 2021 season.[75] Through the end of the 2021 season, Tomlin's record is 162â94â2 (.632), including playoffs. He is the first Pittsburgh coach to never post a losing season. The 2013â17 seasons were noted for record performances from the \"Killer B's\". This trio consisted of Antonio Brown, Ben Roethlisberger and Le'Veon Bell.[76] Occasionally, the \"Killer B's\" has also included kicker Chris Boswell due to his ability to hit game-winning field goals.[77] Prior to the 2022 season, the team drafted Pitt quarterback Kenny Pickett with their first round pick in the 2022 NFL Draft.[78] Pickett started 12 games as the Steelers went 9â8 and missed the postseason in the 2022 season.[79] In the 2023 season, the team finished 10â7 and third in the AFC North.[80] They made the playoffs and were defeated by the Buffalo Bills in the Wild Card Round 31â17.[81] Prior to the 2024 season, the Steelers traded Pickett to the Philadelphia Eagles.[82] The team traded for Justin Fields from the Chicago Bears and signed Russell Wilson, who was released from the Denver Broncos.[83][84] Since the NFL merger in 1970, the Pittsburgh Steelers have compiled a regular-season record of 444â282â2 (.635) and an overall record of 480â305â2 (.635) including the playoffs, reached the playoffs 30 times, won their division 22 times, played in 16 AFC championship games, and won six of eight Super Bowls. They are also the only NFL team not to have a season with 12 or more losses since the league expanded to a 16-game schedule in 1978.[85] Since 2008, the Rooney family has brought in several investors for the team while retaining control of the team itself. This came about so that the team could comply with NFL ownership regulations.[86] Dan Rooney, and his son, Art Rooney II, president of the franchise, wanted to stay involved with the franchise, while two of the brothers â Timothy and Patrick â wanted to further pursue racetracks that they own in Florida and New York.[87] Since 2006, many of the racetracks have added video slot machines, causing them to violate \"NFL policy that prohibits involvement with racetrack and gambling interests\".[88] Upon Dan Rooney's death in 2017, he and Art Rooney II retained control of the team with the league-minimum 30%, the following made up the other investors at the time: Three minority investors in the Steelers have since became majority owners of other NFL teams:[93] Through the end of the 2023 season, the Steelers have an all-time record of 707â606â22, including playoffs. In recent seasons the Steelers have generally performed well, qualifying for the playoffs six times in the past ten seasons, while winning their division four times.[94] In the NFL's \"modern era\" (since the AFLâNFL merger in 1970) the Steelers have posted the best record in the league. The franchise has won the most regular-season games, the most playoff games (33 playoff wins; the Dallas Cowboys are second with 32), won the most divisional titles (20), has played in the most conference championship games (15), hosted the most conference championship games (11), and is tied with the Dallas Cowboys, the Denver Broncos and the New England Patriots for the most Super Bowl appearances (8).[95] The Steelers have the best winning percentage (including every expansion team), earned the most All-Pro nominations, and have accumulated the most Super Bowl wins (6) since the modern game started in 1970. In 2017, they became the first team to reach 450 victories in the regular season since the 1970 merger.[96][97] The Steelers are 36â26 (.580) in the postseason, with all but one (the 1947 playoff) having been played since the merger.[98] The franchise, along with the Rooney family have for generations been strong advocates for equality of opportunity for both minorities and women. Among these achievements of the Steelers was the first to hire an African-American assistant coach (September 29, 1957, with Lowell Perry), the first to start an African-American quarterback (December 3, 1973, with Joe Gilliam),[a] the first team to boast of an African-American Super Bowl MVP (January 12, 1975, with Franco Harris), the first to hire an African-American Coordinator (September 2, 1984, with Tony Dungy), the first owner to push for passage of an \"equal opportunity\" mandating that at least one minority candidate is given an interview in all head coach hiring decisions throughout the league (the Rooney Rule in the early 2000s), and the first to hire a female as full-time athletic trainer (Ariko Iso on July 24, 2002).[99] The Steelers were a part of the NFL Eastern Division from 1933 to 1943 and were briefly in the Western Division in 1944, before returning to the Eastern Division until 1949. The team was then in the American Conference from 1950 to 1952, and the Eastern Conference from 1953 to 1966. They were then placed in the Century Division of the Eastern Conference in 1967. When the league reformed into the NFC and AFC in 1970, the Steelers were placed in the AFC Central until 2001 when they were realigned into the AFC North Division. The Steelers have used black and gold as their colors since the club's inception, the lone exception being the 1943 season when they merged with the Philadelphia Eagles and formed the \"Steagles\"; the team's colors at that time were green and white as a result of wearing Eagles uniforms. Originally, the team wore solid gold-colored helmets and black jerseys. The Steelers' black and gold colors are now shared by all major professional teams in the city, including the Pittsburgh Pirates in baseball and the Pittsburgh Penguins in ice hockey. The shade of gold differs slightly among teams: the Penguins have previously used \"Vegas Gold\", a color similar to metallic gold, and the Pirates' gold is a darker mustard yellow-gold, while the Steelers \"gold\" is more of a bright canary yellow. Black and gold are also the colors of the city's official flag. The Steelers logo was introduced in 1962 and is based on the \"Steelmark\", originally designed by Pittsburgh's U.S. Steel and now owned by the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI). In fact, it was Cleveland-based Republic Steel that suggested the Steelers adopt the industry logo. It consists of the word \"Steelers\" surrounded by three astroids (hypocycloids of four cusps). The original meanings behind the astroids were, \"Steel lightens your work, brightens your leisure, and widens your world.\" Later, the colors came to represent the ingredients used in the steel-making process: yellow for coal, red for iron ore, and blue for scrap steel.[100] While the formal Steelmark logo contains only the word \"Steel\", the team was given permission to add \"ers\" in 1963 after a petition to AISI. The Steelers are the only NFL team that puts its logo on only one side of the helmet (the right side). Longtime field and equipment manager Jack Hart was instructed to do this by Art Rooney as a test to see how the logo appeared on the gold helmets; however, its popularity led the team to leave it that way permanently.[101] A year after introducing the logo, they switched to black helmets to make it stand out more. The Steelers, along with the New York Giants, are one of only two teams in the National Football League to have the players' uniform numbers on both the front and back of the helmets. The current uniform designs were introduced in 1968. The design consists of gold pants and either black jerseys or white jerseys, except for the 1970 and 1971 seasons when the Steelers wore white pants with their white jerseys. In 1997, the team switched to rounded numbers on the jersey to match the number font (Futura Condensed) on the helmets, and a Steelers logo was added to the left side of the jersey. The 2007â2011 third uniform, consisting of a black jersey with gold lettering, white pants with black and gold stripes, and a gold helmet were first used during the Steelers' 75th anniversary season in 2007. They were meant to evoke the memory of the 1963â1964 era uniforms. The uniforms were so popular among fans that the Steelers' organization decided to keep them and use them as a third option during home games only. In 2012, the Steelers introduced a new third uniform, consisting of a yellow jersey with black horizontal lines (making a bumble bee like pattern) with black lettering and black numbers placed inside a white box, to represent the jerseys worn by the Steelers in their 1934 season. The rest of the uniform consists of beige pants, yellow with black horizontal stripped socks, and the Steelers regular black helmet. The uniforms were used for the Steelers' 80th anniversary season. Much like the previous alternate these jerseys were so popular that they were used up through the 2016 season. The jerseys were nicknamed the \"bumblebee jerseys\" due to looking like the pattern of a bumblebee. The jerseys were retired after the 2016 season.[102] Also in 2016, the Steelers introduced its alternate black Color Rush uniforms. These were based on the uniforms they wore from 1946 to 1965, but with black pants in place of either gold or white pants. In 2018, the Steelers unveiled a third uniform based on those worn from 1968 to 1997, coinciding with the Steel Curtain teams of the 1970s. It is similar to the current uniforms but without the Steelers logo on the left chest and use block lettering and numbers in place of Futura Condensed.[103] In 1979, the team owners were approached by then-Iowa Hawkeyes Head Coach Hayden Fry about designing his fading college team's uniforms in the image of the Steelers.[104] Three days later, the owners sent Fry the reproduction jerseys (home and away versions) of then quarterback Terry Bradshaw. Today, the Hawkeyes still retain the 1979 Steelers uniforms as their home, and away colors. The Pittsburgh Steelers have three primary rivals, all within their division: (Cleveland Browns, Baltimore Ravens, and Cincinnati Bengals). They also have rivalries with other teams that arose from post-season battles in the past, most notably the Las Vegas Raiders, Dallas Cowboys, Denver Broncos, New England Patriots, and Tennessee Titans. They also have an intrastate rivalry with the Philadelphia Eagles, but under the current scheduling the teams play each other only once every four years.[105][106][107] The Steelers and Cleveland Browns have been divisional rivals since the two cities' teams began playing against each other in 1950. After posting a 9â31 record in the first 40 games of the series between the two cities, the Steelers have gone 66â27â1 (including 42â6 in games played in Pittsburgh) since 1970 and currently lead the series 75â58â1;[108] The Steelers have particularly dominated the Browns since their return to the NFL in 1999 and won twelve straight meetings between 2003 and 2009. Additionally, the Browns posted losing streaks of 16 (1970â85) and 15 (2004âpresent) games in Pittsburgh. Former Steelers head coach Bill Cowher coached the Browns special teams and secondary before following Marty Schottenheimer for a brief tenure as Kansas City Chiefs defensive coordinator, and then hired by Pittsburgh. This has only intensified the rivalry. The teams have met three times in the postseason (1994, 2002, and 2021) with the Steelers winning the first two meetings, but losing the most recent in 2021.[109][110] Pittsburgh's rivalry with the Baltimore Ravens has had several memorable match-ups and has escalated into a fierce divisional rivalry. Both teams handed the other their first losses at their current home stadiums. The Steelers won the inaugural game played at Baltimore's M&T Bank Stadium in 1998, 20â13, and three years later the Ravens handed the Steelers their first-ever loss at Heinz Field, 13â10. Later that season (2001) Pittsburgh won a divisional playoff game 27â10 against Baltimore, who was the defending Super Bowl champion. During their NFL championship season in 2000, the Ravens defeated the Steelers in Pittsburgh, 16â0, in the season opener with the Steelers later exacting revenge, 9â6, in Baltimore (the Ravens' final loss of the season). During the Steelers 2008 Championship run, they beat the Ravens three times, including a win in the AFC Championship game. The two teams complement each other by consistently fielding strong defenses. The Steelers lead the all-time series (including playoffs), 32â24.[111] The teams have met four times in the postseason, with the Steelers owning a 3â1 record.[112] The Steelers' rivalry with the Cincinnati Bengals dates from the 1970 season, when the AFLâNFL merger was completed. In 1976, the Steelers kept their playoff hopes alive (they later won the division) with a late-season 7â3 win in snowy Cincinnati. One of the most memorable games was the 2005 AFC Wildcard playoff game, in which the Steelers, en route to a Super Bowl title, won a 31â17 come-from-behind victory after Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer was forced to leave the game with a knee injury. The injury happened when nose tackle Kimo von Oelhoffen contacted Palmer's knee during a passing play.[113] The Bengals players called this a dirty play; the NFL ruled that it was accidental and did not fine von Oelhoffen for the hit. The incident led to an intensifying of the rivalry. The Bengals beat the Steelers in Week 13 of the 2005 season 38â31, and wide receiver T. J. Houshmandzadeh used a Terrible Towel to polish his cleats while walking up the tunnel after the game, fueling the rivalry. The Steelers and Bengals finished 2005 and 2006 with identical records (11â5 and 8â8 respectively), splitting both regular-season series, the Bengals winning the tiebreaker both years due to having a superior division record. The Steelers also are responsible for ending the Bengals' season in Cincinnati two years in a row, eliminating them from the playoffs in 2005 and taking them out of contention in 2006. The rivalry has become more intense again since the 2015 season. A central figure is Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict, often inflicting brutal hits, resulting in serious injuries to several Steelers on multiple occasions. In the 2015 Wild Card playoff game in Cincinnati, Burfict was the culprit of a late penalty directly responsible for an extremely unlikely 18â16 Steelers comeback victory.[114] The Steelers lead the all-time series, 63â35.[115] The teams have met twice in the postseason, with the Steelers winning both times.[116] The New England Patriots emerged as a prominent rival in league circles when the Patriots upset the Steelers in the 2001 AFC Championship Game at Heinz Field, though the two teams had met in the postseason twice before; the Patriots defeated the Steelers in 1996 28â3 while the Steelers won 7â6 in 1997; both times, the Patriots fielded players with Pittsburgh-area roots in Ty Law and Curtis Martin. Martin's final game with the Patriots was in the 1997 playoffs before he departed to the rival New York Jets. Following the 2001 AFC title upset, the Patriots defeated the Steelers 30â14 at the start of the 2002 season. Pittsburgh did not exact revenge for the two losses until ending the Patriots' record-setting 21-game winning streak in week 6 of the 2004 NFL season. Later that season, the Steelers lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Patriots in the AFC Championship game after a 15â1 regular season. The Patriots won six of seven meetings over a ten-year period (1998â2007) before the Steelers broke through with a 33â10 victory at Foxborough in 2008, after Matt Cassel turned the ball over five times. The Patriots in 2013 then made history by becoming the first opponent to score 55 points on the Steelers, winning 55â31. The Patriots won again in 2015 (28â21) and 2016's regular season (27â16), and then won 36â17 in the 2016 AFC Championship Game. They also won in 2017 when a go-ahead touchdown reception by Steelers' tight end Jesse James was controversially called back.[117] Though they ultimately missed the playoffs, the Steelers defeated the Patriots by a score of 17â10 on December 16, 2018, in Pittsburgh. In the postseason, the Patriots have outscored the Steelers 135â75, with the Patriots maintaining a 4â1 record. The only other franchises with winning AFC playoff records against Steelers include the Los Angeles Chargers (2â1), the Jacksonville Jaguars (2â0), and the Broncos (5â3). The Steelers have an all-time regular-season record of 15â13 against the Patriots.[118] In the Bill Belichick era, the main period of the rivalry, the Patriots have a 12â4 record against the Steelers. In their last matchup, the Patriots beat the Steelers 33â3 on Sunday Night Football. Pittsburgh also has a rivalry with the Houston Oilers/Tennessee Titans franchise. The Oilers were aligned into the AFC Central with the Steelers in 1970 and were division rivals for 32 seasons. The Steelers dominated the rivalry during the Houston era and defeated the Oilers in all three of their playoff matchups. However, since the franchise moved to Tennessee in 1997, the rivalry shifted, with the Titans winning 13 of 22 meetings (including a bitter 34â31 playoff showdown in 2002); the Titans won seven in a row in the 1997â2001 period, the longest win streak by either team in the series. The Steelers have won 47 of 79 career meetings following their 27â24 win at Nissan Stadium in 2020.[119] The Denver Broncos in 2011 broke a tie with the Oakland Raiders for the most playoff meetings versus the Steelers and added yet another meeting in 2015 (the Broncos have met Pittsburgh eight times to Oakland's six). The Steelers' rivalry with the Broncos dates from 1970, but the first notable contest came in 1973, when Denver dealt Pittsburgh its first regular-season defeat at Three Rivers Stadium, 23â13. The following year, they met in the NFL's first regular-season overtime game, which ended in a 35â35 tie. Denver's first playoff game had them hosting the Steelers in the 1977 divisional round; the Broncos won 34â21. The following year, the Steelers hosted and defeated Denver 33â10 in the divisional round. Their next playoff matchup was the 1984 divisional round in Mile High Stadium; the Steelers pulled the upset 24â17. They nearly pulled the upset again 5 years later in Denver, but the Broncos prevailed in the divisional playoff, 24â23. In 1997, the two teams met in Pittsburgh for the AFC Championship Game, where Denver squeaked out at 24â21 win.[120] Eight years later, the Steelers advanced to Super Bowl XL by beating Denver 34â17 in Colorado. In 2011, after appearing in Super Bowl XLV, the Steelers had their campaign to repeat as AFC Champions dashed in Denver after a stunning overtime upset by the Tim Tebow-led Broncos in January 2012, in what would become known as the \"316 game\". The following September the Steelers were defeated in Denver 31â19 in Peyton Manning's debut as Broncos quarterback. The two clubs met twice in 2015, as the Steelers defeated the Broncos in the regular season but fell in the Divisional Round of the AFC playoffs; through the 2021 season, Denver leads the series 20â13â1, including 5â3 in the playoffs.[121] Neither team has beaten the other more than three times in a row. In their last matchup, the Steelers beat the Broncos on October 10, 2021, in Pittsburgh by the score of 27â19. The Steelers' rivalry with the Raiders was one of the most heated battles of the 1970s and early to mid-1980s. The Steelers' first playoff victory in franchise history came against the Raiders, which occurred on December 23, 1972, in a 13â7 victory over the Raiders; the victory occurred when Terry Bradshaw threw a pass intended for John Fuqua that was deflected into the hands of Franco Harris, who scooped the ball from nearly hitting the ground and carried the ball in for a touchdown, which was later referred to as the Immaculate Reception, while attracting controversy from Raiders players and coaches, who alleged that the ball had bounced off Fuqua, which would have made it an illegal play per the rules of the time.[122] The victory sent Pittsburgh to their first ever AFC Championship Game. The following year, the two teams met in the Divisional Round again, and the Raiders responded with a 33â14 victory to advance to the AFC title game. However, Pittsburgh fired back with two straight AFC Championship victories over the Raiders in 1974 (24â13) and 1975 (16â10) to reach the Super Bowl. Oakland responded with a victory over Pittsburgh in the 1976 AFC Championship game 24â7 (the third consecutive AFC title game between the two teams), but not before Chuck Noll referred to Oakland's George Atkinson as part of the NFL's \"criminal element\" after his alleged cheap-shot on Lynn Swann during a regular-season matchup. Atkinson and the Raiders later filed a defamation of character lawsuit against Noll, but lost. Following the 1983 regular season, the Los Angeles Raiders defeated the Steelers 38â10 in the AFC Divisional round which turned out to be the last NFL game for Steeler Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw who did not play due to injury. While the rivalry has dissipated over the years (mostly due to Oakland's decline after 2002), the teams have had notable games against each other including an upset Steelers victory towards the end of the 2000 season to prevent the Raiders from obtaining homefield advantage in the playoffs, and an upset Raiders victory in week 8 of the 2006 NFL season (20â13), which helped cost the Steelers a playoff berth. In Week 13 of the 2009 season, another Raiders upset victory happened; the game lead changed five times on five touchdowns in the fourth quarter until Raiders QB Bruce Gradkowski's third touchdown of the quarter won it with nine seconds to go. The 27â24 loss cost the Steelers another playoff run. The teams met at Pittsburgh in 2010, where the Steelers blew out the Raiders 35â3, and ended their 3-game winning streak; the game was further notable for a punch thrown by Richard Seymour of the Raiders against Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. The Raiders then hosted the Steelers in 2012 and erased a 31â21 gap to win 34â31. The two clubs met again in 2013 and the Raiders won again, 21â18. In 2015, the Steelers defeated the Raiders 38â35 at Heinz Field. In their most recent matchups, the Raiders defeated the Steelers 24â21 on December 9, 2018, in Oakland, which, ironically, would cost Pittsburgh another playoff berth.[123] The Raiders won at Pittsburgh September 19, 2021, 26â17, then fell on Christmas Eve 2022 at Pittsburgh 13â10 on a last-minute touchdown by rookie Steelers quarterback Kenny Pickett. A lifeless performance in a 23â18 loss at Vegas September 23, 2023, contributed to the later firing of Raiders coach Josh McDaniels and GM Dave Ziegler. As of the 2023 season, the Raiders lead the all-time series 17â15.[124] The Steelers once took part in a historic rivalry with the Dallas Cowboys[125] started with the Cowboys' first game as a franchise in 1960 (against the Steelers) at the Cotton Bowl with the Steelers coming away with a 35â28 victory. These teams hold a record for the most times (three) that two teams have met in a Super Bowl. The first two times the favored Steelers and Cowboys met came with Pittsburgh victories in the Orange Bowl Super Bowl X 21â17 and Super Bowl XIII 35â31. The Cowboys never won a regular-season game in the Orange Bowl and lost three Super Bowl games (once to the Baltimore Colts and twice to the Steelers). Between the Cowboys and Steelers, Super Bowl XIII had the greatest number of future Pro Football Hall of Fame players participating, which as of 2021 numbered 25 â 16 players and nine coaches/front office, including Ernie Stautner, defensive coordinator for the Cowboys who was a HoF defensive tackle for the Steelers. The teams featured an all-star matchup at quarterback between the Steelers' Terry Bradshaw and the Cowboys' Roger Staubach, both of whom are in the Hall of Fame. In 1977, Staubach and the Cowboys won Super Bowl XII, their second and last loss of their season being inflicted by Bradshaw and the Steelers, 28â13 at Three Rivers Stadium in November. In 1979, Staubach's final season, the two defending conference champs met again at Three Rivers, the Steelers winning 14â3 en route to winning their fourth Super Bowl title. The Steelers won six of eight meetings during the 1970s and 80s, before the Cowboys won all four meetings during the 1990s, including the teams' record third Super Bowl meeting in 1996, as this time the heavily favored Cowboys beat the Steelers 27â17. Dallas cornerback Larry Brown intercepted Pittsburgh quarterback Neil O'Donnell twice and was named the game's MVP. The teams' first two meetings of the 21st century (2004 and 2008) were won by the Steelers, including a come from behind victory on December 7, 2008, in Pittsburgh, when the Steelers drove the length of the field to tie the game 13â13, then cornerback Deshea Townsend returned an intercepted pass from Tony Romo for the game's final score, Steelers 20, Cowboys 13. The Cowboys won on December 16, 2012, at Cowboys Stadium by a 27â24 margin in overtime and won 35â30 at Heinz Field on November 13, 2016. The all-time series is led by the Dallas Cowboys, 17â16.[126] The Pittsburgh/Dallas rivalry served as a backdrop to the 1977 film Black Sunday, parts of which were filmed during Super Bowl X. Most recently, the Steelers beat the Cowboys by a 24â19 margin. The Philadelphia Eagles and Steelers are both located in Pennsylvania and began play in 1933. From that season through 1966, this was a major rivalry for both teams, as both were part of the same division. In 1967, they were placed in separate divisions, but remained in the same conference for three years. In 1970 the Steelers (along with the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Colts) moved to the American Football Conference, while the Eagles stayed with the rest of the old-line NFL teams in the National Football Conference. As a result, the Eagles and Steelers no longer played each other every year; instead, they are scheduled to meet once every four years in the regular season. The most recent meeting was in 2022 at Lincoln Financial Field due to the addition of a regular season game based on opposing conference divisional finish from the season before, with the Eagles winning 35â13. The Steelers have lost ten straight games on the road against the Eagles dating back to 1966, which was also the start of the Super Bowl era. The Eagles lead the all-time series 49â29â3.[127] Prior to the 2007 season, the Steelers introduced Steely McBeam as their official mascot.[128] As part of the 75th anniversary celebrations of the team, his name was selected from a pool of 70,000 suggestions submitted by fans of the team.[128] Diane Roles of Middlesex Township, submitted the winning name which was \"meant to represent steel for Pittsburgh's industrial heritage, \"Mc\" for the Rooney family's Irish roots, and Beam for the steel beams produced in Pittsburgh, as well as for Jim Beam, her husband's favorite alcoholic beverage.\"[129] Steely McBeam is visible at all home games and participates in the team's charitable programs and other club-sponsored events.[128] Steely's autograph is known to be drawn with an oversized S, and the L is drawn to look like a beam of steel.[128] The Steelers have a tradition of having a large fanbase, which has spread from Pittsburgh. In August 2008, ESPN.com ranked the Steelers' fans as the best in the NFL, citing their \"unbelievable\" sellout streak of 299 consecutive games.[11][130] The team gained a large fan base nationally based on its success in the 1970s, but many consider the collapse of the city's steel industry at the end of the 1970s dynasty into the 1980s (and the resulting diaspora) to be a large catalyst for the size of the fan base in other cities.[131] The Steelers have sold out every home game since the 1972 season.[132] The Pittsburgh Steelers have numerous unofficial fan clubs in many cities throughout the country, that typically meet in bars or taverns on game days. This phenomenon is known to occur for other NFL teams as well, but \"Steeler bars\" are more visible than most, including representative establishments even in cities that field their own NFL teams. The Terrible Towel has been described by the Associated Press as \"arguably the best-known fan symbol of any major pro sports team\".[132] Conceived of by broadcaster Myron Cope in 1975,[132] the towel's rights have since been given to the Allegheny Valley School in Coraopolis, which cares for over 900 people with intellectual disability and physical disabilities, including Cope's autistic son.[133] Since 1996, proceeds from the Terrible Towel have helped raise more than $2.5 million for the school.[133] The Steelers have no official fight song, but many fan versions of \"Here We Go Steelers\" and the \"Steelers Polka\" (the latter a parody of \"Pennsylvania Polka\") by ethnic singer Jimmy Pol, both originating in the 1970s, have been recorded. Since 1994, the song \"Here We Go\" by local singer Roger Wood has been popular among fans.[134] Since 2002, the 1979 Styx song \"Renegade\" is played near the end of the third quarter or the start of the fourth quarter at the start of a defensive stand to rally the crowd, featuring a compilation of recent Steelers defensive highlights. Another song from hometown rapper Wiz Khalifa, \"Black and Yellow\", which is an ode to growing up in Pittsburgh, is also a standard part of the Steelers home game experience.[135] The Steelers were the first NFL team to have a cheerleading squad, they were known as the Steelerettes. Their run only lasted from 1961 to 1969. To this day, they were the only cheerleaders the team had in their history.[136] During the offseason, the Steelers have long participated in charity basketball games throughout Western Pennsylvania and neighboring areas. The games usually feature six active players as well as their player-coach playing against a group of local civic leaders.[137] The players, whose participants aren't announced until the day of the game, sign free autographs for fans during halftime.[138] In 2001, the Steelers moved into Heinz Field.[139] The franchise dating back to 1933 has had several homes.[140] For 31 seasons, the Steelers shared Forbes Field with the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1933 to 1963. In 1958, though they started splitting their home games at Pitt Stadium three blocks away at the University of Pittsburgh. From 1964 to 1969, the Steelers played exclusively at the on-campus facility before moving with the Pirates to Three Rivers Stadium on the city's Northside. The team moved to what was then known as Heinz Field in 2001. In February 2022, after Heinz declined to sign a new deal after naming rights expired, the Steelers signed a deal with Acrisure and renamed the stadium to Acrisure Stadium.[141] The Steelers hold training camp east of the city at Saint Vincent College in Latrobe.[142] The site is one of the most storied in the league with Peter King of SI.com describing it as: \"... I love the place. It's the perfect training-camp setting, looking out over the rolling hills of the Laurel Highlands in west-central Pennsylvania, an hour east of Pittsburgh. On a misty or foggy morning, standing atop the hill at the college, you feel like you're in Scotland. Classic, wonderful slice of American culture. If you can visit one training camp, this is the one to see.\"[143] The team has its headquarters and practice facilities at the state-of-the-art University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Sportsplex on Pittsburgh's Southside. Constructed in 2000, the facility combines the vast expertise of sports medical professionals and researchers as well as hosting the University of Pittsburgh Panthers football team.[144] In 2020 and 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Steelers held their training camp at Heinz Field. They returned to Saint Vincent College for the 2022 season.[145] The Rooney family has long had a close relationship with Duquesne University in the city and from the teams founding in the 1930s to the late 1990s used Art Rooney Field and other facilities on campus as either its primary or secondary in-season training site as well as Greenlee Field during the 1930s.[146] In the 1970s and 1980s, the team had season scrimmages at South Park in the suburban south hills of Pittsburgh. During various seasons including the strike season of 1987, the Steelers used Point Stadium in nearby Johnstown for game week practices.[147] During the 1950s St. Bonaventure University (where Art Rooney's brother Silas was serving as athletic director)[148][149] and suburban Ligonier[150] also served as a pre-season training camp sites.

The team retired Greene's #75 in 2014 and left the possibility open that they would retire other players' jersey numbers at later dates. However, several numbers have not been reissued since the retirement of the players who wore them, including:[154] The Steelers boast the third most \"primary\" inductees into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, i.e. inductees that spent most or all of their NFL careers in Pittsburgh. They also can claim the most honorees of any franchise founded on or after 1933 and the only franchise with three members of ownership in the Hall of Fame.[155] The following Steelers players have been named to the Pro Bowl:[195] The following Steelers were named to NFL All-Decade Teams (and 75th and 100th Anniversary All-Time Teams, selected in 1994 and 2019, respectively). Only those who spent time with Pittsburgh during the respective decades are listed. Bold indicates those elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. In 2007, in celebration of the franchise's 75th season, the team announced an updated All-Time team of the 33 best players who have ever played for the Steelers.[198] This team supplanted the previous All-Time team of 24 players named as part of the 50th anniversary commemoration in 1982.[199] A \"Legends team\" consisting of the club's best pre-1970s players was released concurrently with the latest All-Time team.[200] The regional Dapper Dan Charities has since 1939 named the \"Sportsman of the Year\" in the Pittsburgh region. 19 Steelers have won the award in 23 events: The Pittsburgh Steelers Hall of Honor was established on August 1, 2017.[206] There have been 57 inductees.[207][208][209][210][211][212][213][214] The Steelers have had 16 coaches through their history.[215] They have cycled through the fewest head coaches in the modern NFL history.[216] Their first coach was Forrest Douds, who coached them to a 3â6â2 record in 1933. Chuck Noll had the longest term as head coach with the Steelers; he is one of only four coaches to coach a single NFL team for 23 years.[6] Hired prior to the 2007 season, the Steelers current coach is Mike Tomlin.[217] â Coaching staff â Front office â More NFL staffs Source:[218] Source:[218] As of 2006, the Steelers' flagship radio stations were WDVE 102.5 FM and WBGG 970 AM. Both stations are owned by iHeartMedia. Games are also available on 51 radio stations in Pennsylvania, Western Maryland, Ohio, and Northern West Virginia.[219] The announcer is Tunch Ilkin. Craig Wolfley is the sideline reporter. Myron Cope, the longtime color analyst and inventor of the \"Terrible Towel\", retired after the 2004 season, and died in 2008. Longtime lead announcer Bill Hillgrove retired after the 2023 season. Pre-season games not shown on one of the national broadcasters are seen on CBS O&O KDKA-TV, channel 2; independent sister station WPKD-TV, channel 19; and AT&T SportsNet Pittsburgh. KDKA-TV's Bob Pompeani and former Steelers quarterback Charlie Batch do the announcing for the pre-season games, as well as the two hosting the pre-game program Steelers Kickoff during the regular season prior to the national airing of The NFL Today. Pompeani and former Steelers lineman Chris Hoke also host the Xfinity Xtra Point following the game on days when CBS does not have that week's NFL doubleheader. When CBS has a week's doubleheader, the show airs on WPKD-TV. Coach Mike Tomlin's weekly press conference is shown live on AT&T SportsNet Pittsburgh. Both Batch and Hoke replaced former Steelers lineman Edmund Nelson, who retired from broadcasting in 2015.[220] Thursday Night Football broadcasts are shown locally on Fox affiliate WPGH-TV, channel 53 (along with home games with NFC opponents and some flexed interconference games), while ESPN Monday Night Football broadcasts are shown locally on WTAE-TV, channel 4. (WTAE-TV is owned by the Hearst Corporation, which owns a 20% stake in ESPN.) By virtue of being members of the AFC, most of the Steelers' games air on CBS and KDKA. NBC Sunday Night Football games are carried by WPXI, channel 11, in the market. The Steelers hold a national contract with Grupo Imagen for radio rights to their games in Mexico; Imagen broadcasts the Steelers on their stations in 17 Mexican cities. The Steelers franchise has a rich history of producing well-known sportscasters over the years. The most famous of these is probably Myron Cope, who served as a Steelers radio color commentator for 35 seasons (1970â2004).[221] Several former Steelers players have gone on to careers in media after completing their playing careers. The Steelers Digest is the only official newspaper for the Pittsburgh Steelers.[222] It has been published for 22 years and is currently published by Dolphin/Curtis Publishing in Miami, Florida, which also handles several other publications. The newspaper is very widely acknowledged by Steelers fans. Issues are mailed out to paying subscribers weekly through the season after every regular-season game and continue through playoffs as long as the Steelers do. After a Super Bowl victory, a bonus issue is published, which is followed by a draft preview, draft recap, and training camp edition every other month, then leading into the pre-season. There are typically 24 issues of the paper within a publishing year. The newspaper is listed on the official Steelers.com page. The Steelers' success over several decades has permeated film and literature. The Steelers are portrayed in the following big-budget Hollywood films: The protagonist of John Grisham's novel The Associate is a staunch Steelers fan.[235] In the summer of 2019, the Kennywood theme park located near Pittsburgh, opened a new land themed to the Pittsburgh Steelers, Steelers Country, featuring a major record-breaking coaster, the Steel Curtain.[236] The land, in addition to this ride, features a Steelers-themed experience, and an 'End Zone Restaurant'. The Steelers helped launch the Chuck Noll Foundation for Brain Injury Research in November 2016 by donating $1 million.[237] The Foundation, started by Steelers president Art Rooney II, focuses on education and research regarding brain injuries and sports-related concussions.[238] In June 2017, the Steelers announced an inaugural charity walk to raise money for the foundation.[239]",

Pittsburgh plays in the AFC North with Baltimore, the Cincinnati Bengals, and the Cleveland Browns. The Steelers are most famous for their defense. In the 1970s, their defense was nicknamed the \"Steel Curtain\". It helped the Steelers to four Super Bowl wins. Other well-known Steelers defenses include the 1990s \"Blitzburgh\" defense and the 2000s defense (which was not nicknamed).

                "content": "The History of the Steelers Logo When it comes to dates in Steelers history, none is more significant than July 8, 1933, because that was when the franchise was founded by Art Rooney Sr. For the first 7 years of its existence, Rooney's franchise was known as the Pirates, but before the start of the 1940 season he renamed it the Steelers. To commemorate that, Rooney was given a plaque featuring a football-shaped image honoring the city's steel industry with the words \"Pittsburgh Steelers Football Club\" around the edge. Even though NFL team logos didn't exist back then, Rooney appreciated the gift and liked the design, and so starting in 1940 that became the first logo identifying the Steelers. It was used almost exclusively as letterhead. As the NFL clawed for a bigger piece of the professional sports pie after the end of World War II, teams explored ways to attract more attention. As Dan Rooney became more involved in his father's franchise during the late 1950s, he planted the seed for the idea that blossomed into a logo that newspapers used to spruce up its coverage of the team. The \"Man on the Beam\" logo developed a public profile during the late 1950s, and in 1998 when the NFL instituted a program to promote throwback merchandise the league chose that to represent the Steelers. In 1948, logos became much more visible when the Los Angeles Rams allowed running back Fred Gehrke, an art major at the University of Utah, to paint horns on their helmets â mainly because he offered to do it for free. The Steelers featured each player's jersey number on both sides of a gold helmet, but things all came together in 1962 when Rooney was approached by Republic Steel, headquartered in Cleveland, and offered the Steelmark as a helmet logo. The Steelmark is a symbol created by the American Iron and Steel Institute, and it's in the form of a circle that encloses three hypocycloids and the word \"Steel.\" The hypocycloids are three different colors, which eventually came to represent the three elements used to make steel: yellow for coal, orange for ore, and blue for steel scrap. When the first batch arrived, Rooney wasn't certain they looked all that good on a solid gold helmet. Equipment manager Jackie Hart was instructed to put them only on one side of the helmet as a visual test. The 1962 Steelers finished 9-5 to become the winningest team in franchise history and qualified for the Playoff Bowl, which was a postseason exhibition pitting the second-place teams from each of the NFL's two conferences. Wanting to commemorate that success, in advance of the Playoff Bowl the Steelers switched to black helmets and ended up liking how the logo popped against a dark background. Rooney's final step was to petition the American Iron and Steel Institute for permission to change the word \"Steel\" to \"Steelers,\" and when the orange hypocycloid was changed to red, the look was complete and remains unchanged.",

                "content": "George Soros[a] HonFBA (born GyÃ¶rgy Schwartz; August 12, 1930)[1][2] is an American[b] investor and philanthropist.[7][8] As of October 2023[update], he had a net worth of US$6.7 billion,[9][10] having donated more than $32 billion to the Open Society Foundations,[11] of which $15 billion has already been distributed, representing 64% of his original fortune. In 2020, Forbes called Soros the \"most generous giver\" (in terms of percentage of net worth).[12] He is a resident of New York.[13] Born in Budapest to a non-observant Jewish family, Soros survived the Nazi occupation of Hungary and moved to the United Kingdom in 1947. He studied at the London School of Economics and was awarded a BSc in philosophy in 1951, and then a Master of Science degree, also in philosophy, in 1954.[14][15][16] Soros started his career working in British and American merchant banks, before setting up his first hedge fund, Double Eagle, in 1969.[17] Profits from this fund provided the seed money for Soros Fund Management, his second hedge fund, in 1970. Double Eagle was renamed Quantum Fund and was the principal firm Soros advised. At its founding, Quantum Fund had $12 million in assets under management, and as of 2011[update] it had $25 billion, the majority of Soros's overall net worth.[18] Soros is known as \"The Man Who Broke the Bank of England\" as a result of his short sale of US$10 billion worth of pounds sterling, which made him a profit of $1 billion, during the 1992 Black Wednesday UK currency crisis.[19] Based on his early studies of philosophy, Soros formulated the General Theory of Reflexivity for capital markets, to provide insights into asset bubbles and fundamental/market value of securities, as well as value discrepancies used for shorting and swapping stocks.[20] Soros supports progressive and liberal political causes, to which he dispenses donations through the Open Society Foundations.[21] Between 1979 and 2011, he donated more than $11 billion to various philanthropic causes;[22][23] by 2017, his donations \"on civil initiatives to reduce poverty and increase transparency, and on scholarships and universities around the world\" totaled $12 billion.[24] He influenced the fall of communism in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s,[25] and provided one of Europe's largest higher education endowments to the Central European University in his Hungarian hometown.[26] Soros's extensive funding of political causes has made him a \"bugaboo of European nationalists\".[27] Numerous far-right theorists have promoted claims that characterize Soros as a dangerous \"puppet master\" behind alleged global plots.[28][29][30] Criticisms of Soros, who is of Jewish descent, have often been called antisemitic.[31][32][33] In 2018, The New York Times reported that \"conspiracy theories about him have gone mainstream, to nearly every corner of the Republican Party\".[28] GyÃ¶rgy Schwartz was born on 12 August 1930 in Budapest in the Kingdom of Hungary to a prosperous non-observant Jewish family, who, like many upper-middle class Hungarian Jews at the time, were uncomfortable with their roots. Soros has wryly described his home as a Jewish antisemitic home.[34] The family of his mother ErzsÃ©bet (also known as Elizabeth) operated a successful silk store.[35] His father Tivadar (also known as Teodoro Åvarc) was a lawyer and a well-known Esperanto author who edited the Esperanto literary magazine Literatura Mondo and raised his son to speak the language.[35][36] Tivadar had also been a prisoner of war during and after World War I until he escaped from Russia and rejoined his family in Budapest.[37][38] His parents married in 1924. In 1936, Soros's family changed their name from the German-Jewish \"Schwartz\" to \"Soros\", as protective camouflage in increasingly antisemitic Hungary.[39][40] Tivadar liked the new name because it is a palindrome and because of its meaning. In Hungarian, soros means \"next\"; in Esperanto it means \"will soar\".[41][42][43] Soros was 13 years old in March 1944 when Nazi Germany occupied Hungary.[44] The Nazis barred Jewish children from attending school, and Soros and the other schoolchildren were made to report to the Judenrat (\"Jewish Council\"), which had been established during the occupation. Soros later described this time to writer Michael Lewis: The Jewish Council asked the little kids to hand out the deportation notices. I was told to go to the Jewish Council. And there I was given these small slips of paper ... I took this piece of paper to my father. He instantly recognized it. This was a list of Hungarian Jewish lawyers. He said, \"You deliver the slips of paper and tell the people that if they report they will be deported\". I'm not sure to what extent he knew they were going to be gassed. I did what my father said.[45][46] Soros did not return to that job; his family survived the war by purchasing documents to say that they were Christians.[47] Later that year at age 14, Soros posed as the Christian godson of an official of the collaborationist Hungarian government's Ministry of Agriculture, who himself had a Jewish wife in hiding. On one occasion, rather than leave the 14-year-old alone, the official took Soros with him while completing an inventory of a Jewish family's confiscated estate. Tivadar saved not only his immediate family, but also many other Hungarian Jews, and Soros later wrote that 1944 had been \"the happiest [year] of his life\", for it had given him the opportunity to witness his father's heroism.[48][49] In 1945, Soros survived the Siege of Budapest, in which Soviet and German forces fought house-to-house through the city. George and his mother also spent some time hiding with the family of Elza Brandeisz and even attended their Lutheran church with them.[50] When he was 17, Soros relocated to Paris before eventually moving to England.[51] There he became a student at the London School of Economics.[52] While a student of the philosopher Karl Popper, Soros worked as a railway porter and as a waiter, and once received Â£40 from a Quaker charity.[53] Soros would sometimes stand at Speakers' Corner lecturing about the virtues of internationalism in Esperanto, which he had learned from his father.[54] Soros obtained his Bachelor of Science in philosophy in 1951 and a Master of Science in philosophy in 1954 from the London School of Economics.[14] After graduating, he wanted to stay in the university and work as a professor, but his grades were not high enough, prompting him to work for an investment firm in London.[51] In a discussion at the Los Angeles World Affairs Council in 2006, Alvin Shuster, former foreign editor of the Los Angeles Times, asked Soros, \"How does one go from an immigrant to a financier? ... When did you realize that you knew how to make money?\". Soros replied, \"Well, I had a variety of jobs and I ended up selling fancy goods on the seaside, souvenir shops, and I thought, that's really not what I was cut out to do. So, I wrote to every managing director in every merchant bank in London, got just one or two replies, and eventually that's how I got a job in a merchant bank.\"[55] In 1954, Soros began his financial career at the merchant bank Singer & Friedlander of London. He worked as a clerk and later moved to the arbitrage department. A fellow employee, Robert Mayer, suggested he apply at his father's brokerage house, F.M. Mayer of New York.[56] In 1956, Soros moved to New York City, where he worked as an arbitrage trader for F. M. Mayer (1956â59). He specialized in European stocks, which were becoming popular with U.S. institutional investors following the formation of the Coal and Steel Community, which later became the Common Market.[57] In 1959, after three years at F. M. Mayer, Soros moved to Wertheim & Co. He planned to stay for five years, enough time to save $500,000, after which he intended to return to England to study philosophy.[58] He worked as an analyst of European securities until 1963. During this period, Soros developed the theory of reflexivity to extend the ideas of his tutor at the London School of Economics, Karl Popper.[59] Reflexivity posits that market values are often driven by the fallible ideas of participants, not only by the economic fundamentals of the situation. Ideas and events influence each other in reflexive feedback loops. Soros argued that this process leads to markets having procyclical \"virtuous\" or \"vicious\" cycles of boom and bust, in contrast to the equilibrium predictions of more standard neoclassical economics.[60][61] From 1963 to 1973, Soros's experience as a vice president at Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder resulted in little enthusiasm for the job; business was slack following the introduction of the Interest Equalization Tax, which undermined the viability of Soros's European trading. He spent the years from 1963 to 1966 with his main focus on the revision of his philosophy dissertation. In 1966, he started a fund with $100,000 of the firm's money to experiment with his trading strategies. In 1969, Soros set up the Double Eagle hedge fund with $4m of investors' capital including $250,000 of his own money.[62] It was based in CuraÃ§ao, Dutch Antilles.[63] Double Eagle itself was an offshoot of Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder's First Eagle fund established by Soros and that firm's chairman Henry H. Arnhold in 1967.[64][65] In 1973, the Double Eagle Fund had $12 million and formed the basis of the Soros Fund. George Soros and Jim Rogers received returns on their share of capital and 20 percent of the profits each year.[57] In 1970, Soros founded Soros Fund Management and became its chairman. Among those who held senior positions there at various times were Jim Rogers, Stanley Druckenmiller, Mark Schwartz, Keith Anderson, and Soros's two sons.[66][67][68] In 1973, due to perceived conflicts of interest limiting his ability to run the two funds, Soros resigned from the management of the Double Eagle Fund. He then established the Soros Fund and gave investors in the Double Eagle Fund the option of transferring to that or staying with Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder. It was later renamed the Quantum Fund, after the physical theory of quantum mechanics. By that time the value of the fund had grown to $12m, only a small proportion of which was Soros's own money. He and Jim Rogers reinvested their returns from the fund, and also a large part of their 20% performance fees, thereby expanding their stake.[56] By 1981, the fund had grown to $400m, and then a 22% loss in that year and substantial redemptions by some of the investors reduced it to $200m.[69] In July 2011, Soros announced that he had returned funds from outside investors' money (valued at $1 billion) and instead invested funds from his $24.5 billion family fortune, due to changes in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure rules, which he felt would compromise his duties of confidentiality to his investors. The fund had at that time averaged over 20% per year compound returns.[70] In 2013, the Quantum Fund made $5.5 billion, making it again the most successful hedge fund in history. Since its inception in 1973, the fund has generated $40 billion.[71] The fund announced in 2015 that it would inject $300 million to help finance the expansion of Fen Hotels, an Argentine hotel company. The funds will develop 5,000 rooms over the next three years throughout various Latin American countries.[72] Soros had been building a huge short position in pounds sterling for months leading up to the Black Wednesday of September 1992. Soros had recognized the unfavorable position of the United Kingdom in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. For Soros, the rate at which the United Kingdom was brought into the European Exchange Rate Mechanism was too high, their inflation was also much too high (triple the German rate), and British interest rates were hurting their asset prices.[73] By September 16, 1992, the day of Black Wednesday, Soros's fund had sold short more than $10 billion in pounds,[66] profiting from the UK government's reluctance to either raise its interest rates to levels comparable to those of other European Exchange Rate Mechanism countries or float its currency. Finally, the UK withdrew from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, devaluing the pound. Soros's profit on the bet was estimated at over $1 billion.[74] He was dubbed \"the man who broke the Bank of England\".[75] The estimated cost of Black Wednesday to the UK Treasury was Â£3.4 billion.[76] Stanley Druckenmiller, who traded under Soros, originally saw the weakness in the pound and stated: \"[Soros's] contribution was pushing him to take a gigantic position\".[77][78] On October 26, 1992, The New York Times quoted Soros as saying: \"Our total position by Black Wednesday had to be worth almost $10 billion. We planned to sell more than that. In fact, when Norman Lamont said just before the devaluation that he would borrow nearly $15 billion to defend sterling, we were amused because that was about how much we wanted to sell.\" Soros was believed to have traded billions of Finnish markkas on February 5, 1996, in anticipation of selling them short. The markka had been put floating as a result of the early 1990s depression. The Bank of Finland and the Finnish Government commented at the time they believed that a \"conspiracy\" was impossible.[79] During the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the prime minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad, accused Soros of using the wealth under his control to punish the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) for welcoming Myanmar as a member. With a history of antisemitic remarks, Mahathir made specific reference to Soros's Jewish background (\"It is a Jew who triggered the currency plunge\")[80] and implied Soros was orchestrating the crash as part of a larger Jewish conspiracy. Nine years later, in 2006, Mahathir met with Soros and afterward stated that he accepted that Soros had not been responsible for the crisis.[81] In 1998's The Crisis of Global Capitalism: Open Society Endangered, Soros explained his role in the crisis as follows: The financial crisis that originated in Thailand in 1997 was particularly unnerving because of its scope and severity ... By the beginning of 1997, it was clear to Soros Fund Management that the discrepancy between the trade account and the capital account was becoming untenable. We sold short the Thai baht and the Malaysian ringgit early in 1997 with maturities ranging from six months to a year. (That is, we entered into contracts to deliver at future dates Thai baht and Malaysian ringgit that we did not currently hold.) Subsequently, Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia accused me of causing the crisis, a wholly unfounded accusation. We were not sellers of the currency during or several months before the crisis; on the contrary, we were buyers when the currencies began to declineâwe were purchasing ringgits to realize the profits on our earlier speculation. (Much too soon, as it turned out. We left most of the potential gain on the table because we were afraid that Mahathir would impose capital controls. He did so, but much later.)[82] In 1999, economist Paul Krugman was critical of Soros's effect on financial markets: [N]obody who has read a business magazine in the last few years can be unaware that these days there really are investors who not only move money in anticipation of a currency crisis, but actually do their best to trigger that crisis for fun and profit. These new actors on the scene do not yet have a standard name; my proposed term is \"Soroi\".[83] In an interview concerning the late-2000s recession, Soros referred to it as the most serious crisis since the 1930s. According to Soros, market fundamentalism with its assumption that markets will correct themselves with no need for government intervention in financial affairs has been \"some kind of an ideological excess\". In Soros's view, the markets' moodsâa \"mood\" of the markets being a prevailing bias or optimism/pessimism with which the markets look at realityâ\"actually can reinforce themselves so that there are these initially self-reinforcing but eventually unsustainable and self-defeating boom/bust sequences or bubbles\".[84] In reaction to the Great Recession, he founded the Institute for New Economic Thinking in October 2009. This is a think tank composed of international economic, business, and financial experts, who are mandated to investigate radical new approaches to organizing the international economic and financial system. In 1988, Soros was contacted by a French financier named Georges PÃ©bereau, who asked him to participate in an effort to assemble a group of investors to purchase a large number of shares in SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale, a leading French bank that was part of a privatization program (something instituted by the new government under Jacques Chirac).[85] Soros eventually decided against participating in the group effort, opting to personally move forward with his strategy of accumulating shares in four French companies: SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale, as well as Suez, Paribas, and the Compagnie GÃ©nÃ©rale d'ÃlectricitÃ©. In 1989, the Commission des OpÃ©rations de Bourse (COB, the French stock exchange regulatory authority) conducted an investigation of whether Soros's transaction in SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale should be considered insider trading. Soros had received no information from the SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale and had no insider knowledge of the business, but he did possess knowledge that a group of investors was planning a takeover attempt. Initial investigations found Soros innocent, and no charges were brought forward.[86] However, the case was reopened a few years later, and the French Supreme Court confirmed the conviction on June 14, 2006,[87] although it reduced the penalty to â¬940,000.[87] Soros denied any wrongdoing, saying news of the takeover was public knowledge[88] and it was documented that his intent to acquire shares of the company predated his own awareness of the takeover.[87] In December 2006, he appealed to the European Court of Human Rights on various grounds, including that the 14-year delay in bringing the case to trial precluded a fair hearing.[89] On the basis of Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights, stating that no person may be punished for an act that was not a criminal offense at the time that it was committed, the court agreed to hear the appeal.[85] In October 2011, the court rejected his appeal in a 4â3 decision, saying that Soros had been aware of the risk of breaking insider trading laws.[90] Until the 2004 presidential election, Soros had not been a large donor to U.S. political campaigns. According to OpenSecrets, during the 2003â2004 election cycle, Soros donated $23,581,000 to various 527 Groups (tax-exempt groups under the United States tax code, 26 U.S.C. Â§ 527). The groups aimed to defeat President George W. Bush. After Bush's reelection, Soros and other donors backed a new political fundraising group called Democracy Alliance, which supports progressive causes and the formation of a stronger progressive infrastructure in America.[91] In August 2009, Soros donated $35 million to the state of New York to be earmarked for underprivileged children and given to parents who had benefit cards at the rate of $200 per child aged 3 through 17, with no limit as to the number of children that qualified. An additional $140 million was put into the fund by the state of New York from money they had received from the 2009 federal recovery act.[53] Soros was an initial donor to the Center for American Progress, and he continues to support the organization through the Open Society Foundations. In October 2011, a Reuters story, \"Soros: not a funder of Wall Street Protests\", was published after several commentators pointed out errors in an earlier Reuters story headlined \"Who's Behind the Wall St. Protests?\" with a lead stating that the Occupy Wall Street movement \"may have benefited indirectly from the largesse of one of the world's richest men [Soros]\". Reuters's follow-up article also reported a Soros spokesman and Adbusters' co-founder Kalle Lasn both saying that Adbustersâthe reputed catalyst for the first Occupy Wall Street protestsâhad never received any contributions from Soros, contrary to Reuters's earlier story that reported that \"indirect financial links\" existed between the two as late as 2010.[92][93] On September 27, 2012, Soros announced that he was donating $1 million to the super PAC backing President Barack Obama's reelection Priorities USA Action.[94] In October 2013, Soros donated $25,000 to Ready for Hillary, becoming a co-chairman of the super PAC's national finance committee.[95] In June 2015, he donated $1 million to the Super PAC Priorities USA Action, which supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race. He donated $6 million to the PAC in December 2015 and $2.5 million in August 2016.[96] Soros launched a new super PAC called Democracy PAC for the 2020 election cycle. By July 2019, he had donated $5.1 million to it.[97] Since 2016, Soros has been donating sums exceeding $1 million to the campaigns of progressive criminal justice reform proponents through the Safety and Justice PAC in local district attorney elections. In many districts, such large contributions were unprecedented and the campaigning strategy was \"turned on its head\" with a focus on incarceration, police misconduct and bail system, according to the Los Angeles Times.[98][99] Larry Krasner was elected as the District Attorney of Philadelphia with the help of a $1.5 million ad campaign funded by Soros in 2017.[100] Soros was the largest donor supporting the campaign of George GascÃ³n for Los Angeles County District Attorney in 2020, contributing $2.25 million to superPACs in GascÃ³n's favor.[101] Soros gave $2 million to a PAC supporting Kim Foxx's campaign for Cook County State's Attorney in 2020.[102] In the second quarter of 2020, Soros gave at least $500,000 to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, becoming one of the campaign's largest donors.[103] For the 2022 United States elections, Soros was the country's largest donor. He donated $128.5 million to support the Democratic Party in the election cycle.[104] According to Waldemar A. Nielsen, an authority on American philanthropy,[105] \"[Soros] has undertaken... nothing less than to open up the once-closed communist societies of Eastern Europe to a free flow of ideas and scientific knowledge from the outside world\".[106] From 1979, as an advocate of 'open societies', Soros financially supported dissidents including Poland's Solidarity movement, Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia and Andrei Sakharov in the Soviet Union.[107] In 1984, he founded his first Open Society Institute in Hungary with a budget of $3 million.[108] Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Soros's funding has played an important role in the newly independent countries. A 2017 study found that a grant program by George Soros which awarded funding to over 28,000 scientists in the former Soviet republics shortly after the end of the Soviet Union \"more than doubled publications on the margin, significantly induced scientists to remain in the science sector, and had long-lasting [beneficial] impacts\".[109] His funding of pro-democratic programs in Georgia was considered by Georgian nationalists to be crucial to the success of the Rose Revolution, although Soros has said that his role has been \"greatly exaggerated\".[110] Alexander Lomaia, secretary of the Georgian Security Council and former Minister of Education and Science, is a former executive director of the Open Society Georgia Foundation (Soros Foundation), overseeing a staff of 50 and a budget of $2.5 million.[111] Former Georgian foreign minister SalomÃ© Zourabichvili wrote that institutions like the Soros Foundation were the cradle of democratization and that all the NGOs that gravitated around the Soros Foundation undeniably carried the revolution. She opines that after the revolution the Soros Foundation and the NGOs were integrated into power.[112] Some Soros-backed pro-democracy initiatives have been banned in Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.[113] Ercis Kurtulus, head of the Social Transparency Movement Association (TSHD) in Turkey, said in an interview 2006 that \"Soros carried out his will in Ukraine and Georgia by using these NGOs ... Last year Russia passed a special law prohibiting NGOs from taking money from foreigners. I think this should be banned in Turkey as well.\"[114] In 1997, Soros closed his foundation in Belarus after it was fined $3 million by the government for \"tax and currency violations\". According to The New York Times 1997, the Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko has been widely criticized in the West and in Russia for his efforts to control the Belarus Soros Foundation and other independent NGOs and to suppress civil and human rights. Soros called the fines part of a campaign to \"destroy independent society\".[115] In June 2009, Soros donated $100 million to Central Europe and Eastern Europe to counter the impact of the Great Recession on the poor, voluntary groups and non-government organisations.[116] Since 2012, the Hungarian Fidesz government has labelled George Soros as an enemy of the state. The government has disagreed with Soros's involvement in the 2015 European migrant crisis. The government has attacked OSF, the international civil support foundation created by George Soros, and tried to revoke the licence of Central European University (Budapest) (which failed mostly due to significant public outrage).[117] In response, Soros called the government \"a mafia state\".[118] As the 2018 election period started, the government introduced public posters with a photo of Soros[119] to create hostility in the general public towards him, using statements such as \"Soros wants millions of migrants to live in Hungary\", and \"Soros wants to dismantle the border fence\". The government also prepared a three-part law plan called the \"Stop Soros package\" (which followed other various law changes[120] in the same year, hindering the workings of several international NGOs in Hungary), which would include various steps against NGOs doing volunteer work related to the refugee crisis. In March 2017, six US senators sent a letter to then secretary of state Rex Tillerson[121] asking that he look into several grants the State Department and the US Agency for International Development (USAID) have given to groups funded by \"left-wing\" Soros. In the same context, the conservative group Judicial Watch has filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit against the U.S. Department of State and USAID compelling them to release records regarding $5 million transferred from USAID to Soros's Open Society branch in Macedonia. The suit alleges that the money was deliberately used to destabilize the Macedonian government.[122] The Open Society Foundation has said its activities in Macedonia were aimed at ethnic reconciliation with the Albanian minority and other forms of assistance since the collapse of Yugoslavia.[123] In January 2017, the \"Stop Operation Soros\" (SOS) initiative was launched in Macedonia. SOS seeks to present \"questions and answers about the way Soros operates worldwide\" and invites citizens to contribute to the research. In a press conference held during the same month, Nenad Mircevski, one of the founders of the initiative, stated that SOS would work towards the \"de-Soros-ization\" of Macedonia.[124] On May 16, 2018, Soros's Open Society Foundations announced they would move its office from Budapest to Berlin, blaming the move on an \"increasingly repressive\" environment in Hungary.[125][126][127] The Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa is a Soros-affiliated organization.[128] In November 2005, Soros said: \"My personal opinion is there's no alternative but to give Kosovo independence\".[129] Soros has helped fund the non-profit group Independent Diplomat, established by the former British diplomat Carne Ross.[130] Soros has funded worldwide efforts to promote drug policy reform. In 2008, Soros donated $400,000 to help fund a successful ballot measure in Massachusetts known as the Massachusetts Sensible Marijuana Policy Initiative which decriminalized possession of less than 1 oz (28 g) of marijuana in the state. Soros has also funded similar measures in California, Alaska, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Nevada and Maine.[131] Among the drug decriminalization groups that have received funding from Soros are the Lindesmith Center and Drug Policy Foundation.[132] Soros donated $1.4 million to publicity efforts to support California's Proposition 5 in 2008, a failed ballot measure that would have expanded drug rehabilitation programs as alternatives to prison for persons convicted of non-violent drug-related offenses.[133] In October 2010, Soros donated $1 million to support California's Proposition 19.[134] According to remarks in an interview in October 2009, it is Soros's opinion that marijuana is less addictive[compared to?] but not appropriate for use by children and students. He himself has not used marijuana for years.[135] Soros has been a major financier of the Drug Policy Alliance â an organization that promotes cannabis legalization â with roughly $5 million in annual contributions from one of his foundations.[136] The Project on Death in America, active from 1994 to 2003,[137] was one of the Open Society Institute's projects, which sought to \"understand and transform the culture and experience of dying and bereavement\".[138] In 1994, Soros delivered a speech in which he reported that he had offered to help his mother, a member of the right-to-die advocacy organization Hemlock Society, commit suicide.[139] In the same speech, he also endorsed the Oregon Death with Dignity Act,[140] proceeding to help fund its advertising campaign.[141] Because of his Jewish identity, wealth, and philanthropy, Soros has been described as \"the perfect code word\" for conspiracy theories that unite antisemitism and Islamophobia. One prominent Soros-related conspiracy theory is that he is behind the 2015 European migrant crisis or importing migrants to European countries. The Hungarian government spent millions of dollars on a poster campaign demonizing Soros. According to anthropologist Ivan Kalmar, \"Many of his most outspoken enemies inside and outside Hungary saw him as leading an international cabal that included other Jews such as the Rothschilds, as well as Freemasons and Illuminati\".[142][143] A pipe bomb was placed in the mailbox at Soros's home in Katonah, New York, on October 22, 2018, as part of the October 2018 United States mail bombing attempts. The package was discovered by a caretaker,[144] who removed it and notified authorities. It was photographed and exploded by the FBI, which launched an investigation.[145][146] For several days afterward, similar bombs were mailed to Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and other Democrats and liberals.[147] On October 26, 2018, Cesar Sayoc Jr. was arrested in Aventura, Florida, on suspicion of mailing the bombs.[148] In August 2019, Sayoc was sentenced to 20 years in prison for mailing 16 pipe bombs to 13 victims. None of the devices exploded.[149] Soros's writings focus heavily on the concept of reflexivity, where the biases of individuals enter into market transactions, potentially changing the fundamentals of the economy. Soros argues that different principles apply in markets depending on whether they are in a \"near to equilibrium\" or a \"far from equilibrium\" state. He argues that, when markets are rising or falling rapidly, they are typically marked by disequilibrium rather than equilibrium, and that the conventional economic theory of the market (the \"efficient market hypothesis\") does not apply in these situations. Soros has popularized the concepts of dynamic disequilibrium, static disequilibrium, and near-equilibrium conditions.[61] He has stated that his own financial success has been attributable to the edge accorded by his understanding of the action of the reflexive effect. Reflexivity is based on three main ideas:[61] A recent example (circa 2008) of reflexivity in modern financial markets is that of the debt and equity of housing markets.[61] Lenders began to make more money available to more people in the 1990s to buy houses. More people bought houses with this larger amount of money, thus increasing the prices of these houses. Lenders looked at their balance sheets, which not only showed that they had made more loans, but that the collaterals backing the loans â the value of the houses â had gone up (because more money was chasing the same amount of housing, relatively). Thus they lent out more money because their balance sheets looked good, and prices rose higher still. This was further amplified by public policy. In the US, home loans were guaranteed by the Federal government. Many national governments saw home ownership as a positive outcome and so introduced grants for first-time home buyers and other financial subsidies, such as the exemption of a primary residence from capital gains taxation. These further encouraged house purchases, leading to further price rises and further relaxation of lending standards. The concept of reflexivity attempts to explain why markets moving from one equilibrium state to another tend to overshoot or undershoot. Soros's theories were originally dismissed by economists,[150] but have received more attention after the 2008 crash including becoming the focus of an issue of the Journal of Economic Methodology.[151] The notion of reflexivity provides an explanation of the theories of complexity economics, as developed at the Santa Fe Institute, although Soros had not publicized his views at the time the discipline was originally developed there in the 1980s.[152][153][154] Although the primary manifestation of the reflexive process that Soros discusses is its effects in the financial markets, he has also explored its effects in politics. He has stated that whereas the greatest threats to the \"open society\" in the past were from communism and fascism (as discussed in The Open Society and Its Enemies by his mentor Karl Popper), the largest current threat is from market fundamentalism. He has suggested that the contemporary domination of world politics and world trade by the United States is a reflexive phenomenon, insofar as the success of military and financial coercion feeds back to encourage increasingly intense applications of the same policies to the point where they will eventually become unsustainable.[155] Soros argues that the current system of financial speculation undermines healthy economic development in many underdeveloped countries. He blames many of the world's problems on the failures inherent in what he characterizes as market fundamentalism.[156] Soros's book The New Paradigm for Financial Markets (May 2008), described a \"superbubble\" that had built up over the past 25 years and was ready to collapse. This was the third in a series of books he has written that have predicted disaster. As he states: I have a record of crying wolf ... I did it first in The Alchemy of Finance (in 1987), then in The Crisis of Global Capitalism (in 1998), and now in this book. So it's three books predicting disaster. [After] the boy cried wolf three times ... the wolf really came.[157] He ascribes his own success to being able to recognize when his predictions are wrong: I'm only rich because I know when I'm wrong ... I basically have survived by recognizing my mistakes. I very often used to get backaches due to the fact that I was wrong. Whenever you are wrong you have to fight or [take] flight. When [I] make the decision, the backache goes away.[157] In February 2009, Soros said the world financial system had in effect disintegrated, adding that there was no prospect of a near-term resolution to the crisis.[158] \"We witnessed the collapse of the financial system ... It was placed on life support, and it's still on life support. There's no sign that we are anywhere near a bottom.\" In January 2016, at an economic forum in Sri Lanka, Soros predicted a financial crisis akin to the 2007â2008 financial crisis based on the state of the global currency, stock and commodity markets as well as the sinking Chinese yuan.[159][160] When asked what he thought about Israel, in The New Yorker, Soros replied: \"I don't deny Jews the right to a national existence â but I don't want to be a part of it\".[161] According to hacked emails released in 2016, Soros's Open Society Foundation has a self-described objective of \"challenging Israel's racist and anti-democratic policies\" in international forums, in part by questioning Israel's reputation as a democracy.[162] He has funded NGOs which have been actively critical of Israeli policies[163][164][165] including groups that campaign for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel.[163] Speaking before a 2003 conference of the Jewish Funders Network, Soros said that the administrations of George W. Bush in the U.S. and Ariel Sharon in Israel, and even the unintended consequences of some of his own actions, were partially contributing to a new European antisemitism. Soros, citing accusations that he was one of the \"Jewish financiers\" who, in antisemitic terms, \"ruled the world by proxy\", suggested that, if the direction of those policies were changed, then anti-Semitism would diminish. Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League later said that Soros's comments held a simplistic view, were counterproductive, biased and a bigoted perception of the situation, and \"blamed the victim\" when holding Jews responsible for antisemitism. Jewish philanthropist Michael Steinhardt, who arranged for Soros's appearance at the conference, clarified that \"George Soros does not think Jews should be hated any more than they deserve to be\".[166] Soros has also said that Jews can overcome antisemitism by \"giv[ing] up on the tribalness\".[167] In a subsequent article for The New York Review of Books, Soros emphasized that: I do not subscribe to the myths propagated by enemies of Israel and I am not blaming Jews for anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism predates the birth of Israel. Neither Israel's policies nor the critics of those policies should be held responsible for anti-Semitism. At the same time, I do believe that attitudes toward Israel are influenced by Israel's policies, and attitudes toward the Jewish community are influenced by the pro-Israel lobby's success in suppressing divergent views.[168] In 2017, Israeli businessman Beny Steinmetz filed a $10-million lawsuit against Soros, alleging that Soros had influenced the government of Guinea to freeze Steinmetz's company BSG Resources out of iron ore mining contracts in the African country due to \"long-standing animus toward the state of Israel\".[169][170][171] Steinmetz claims that Soros engaged in a \"smear\" campaign against him and his companies and blames Soros for scrutiny of him by American, Israeli, Swiss, and Guinean authorities.[172] Soros called Steinmetz's suit \"frivolous and entirely false\" and said that it was \"a desperate PR stunt meant to deflect attention from BSGR's mounting legal problems across multiple jurisdictions\".[173] During an award ceremony for Imre KertÃ©sz, Soros said that the victims of violence and abuse were becoming \"perpetrators of violence\", suggesting that this model explained Israel's behavior towards the Palestinians, which led to walkouts and Soros being booed.[174] In July 2017, a Hungarian billboard campaign backed by Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n, which was considered to be anti-semitic by the country's Jewish groups, vilified Soros as an enemy of the state, using the slogan \"Let's not allow Soros to have the last laugh\".[175] The campaign was estimated to have cost 5.7bn forints (then US$21 million).[176] According to the Israeli ambassador, the campaign \"evokes sad memories but also sows hatred and fear\", a reference to Hungary's role in the deportation of 500,000 Jews during the Holocaust.[177] Lydia Gall of Human Rights Watch asserted that it was reminiscent of Nazi posters during the Second World War featuring \"'the laughing Jew'\".[178] OrbÃ¡n and his government's representative said they had a \"zero tolerance\" of antisemitism, explaining the posters were aiming to persuade voters that Soros was a \"national security risk\".[175] Hours later, in an apparent attempt to ally Israel with Hungary, Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a \"clarification\", denouncing Soros, stating that he \"continuously undermines Israel's democratically elected governments by funding organizations that defame the Jewish state and seek to deny it the right to defend itself\".[179] Soros's son Alexander said in an interview that his father cares about Israel, and that he \"would like to see Israel in Yitzhak Rabin's image. His views are more or less the common views in Meretz and in the Labor Party.\" According to Alexander, Soros supports a two-state solution. The younger Soros recounts that after his bar mitzvah in 1998, his father told him: \"If you're serious about being Jewish, you might want to consider immigrating to Israel\".[180] In a 2018 interview with The New York Times, Alex Soros, the son of George Soros, when asked why his father fights for an open society, Soros replied that in a non-Jewish state, a Jew can only feel safe when other minorities are protected, which is one of the most important driving forces why his father has been active in his philanthropy: But he had always \"identified firstly as a Jew\", and his philanthropy was ultimately an expression of his Jewish identity, in that he felt a solidarity with other minority groups and also because he recognized that a Jew could only truly be safe in a world in which all minorities were protected. Explaining his father's motives, he said, \"The reason you fight for an open society is because that's the only society that you can live in, as a Jewâunless you become a nationalist and only fight for your own rights in your own state\".[181] In December 2023, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan, accused Soros of supporting pro-Palestinian organizations \"that seek the destruction of the State of Israel as a Jewish state\".[182] Soros' son Alexander dismissed accusations of anti-Semitism as \"distorted and dishonest right-wing attacks.\"[183] On November 11, 2003, in an interview with The Washington Post, Soros said that removing President George W. Bush from office was the \"central focus of my life\" and \"a matter of life and death\". He said he would sacrifice his entire fortune to defeat Bush \"if someone guaranteed it\".[184][185] Soros gave $3 million to the Center for American Progress, $2.5 million to MoveOn.org, and $20 million[186] to America Coming Together. These groups worked to support Democrats in the 2004 election. On September 28, 2004, he dedicated more money to the campaign and kicked off his own multistate tour with a speech, \"Why We Must Not Re-elect President Bush\",[187] delivered at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. The online transcript of this speech received many views after Dick Cheney accidentally referred to FactCheck.org as \"factcheck.com\" in the vice presidential debate, causing the owner of that domain to redirect all traffic to Soros's site.[188] His 2003 book, The Bubble of American Supremacy,[189] was a forthright critique of the Bush administration's \"War on Terror\" as misconceived and counterproductive, and a polemic against the re-election of Bush. He explains the title in the closing chapter by pointing out the parallels in this political context with the self-reinforcing reflexive processes that generate bubbles in stock prices. When Soros was asked in 2006 about his statement in The Age of Fallibility that \"the main obstacle to a stable and just world order is the United States\", he responded that \"it happens to coincide with the prevailing opinion in the world. And I think that's rather shocking for Americans to hear. The United States sets the agenda for the world. And the rest of the world has to respond to that agenda. By declaring a 'war on terror' after September 11, we set the wrong agenda for the world ... When you wage war, you inevitably create innocent victims.\"[190] In 2017, Soros described Donald Trump as a con man, and predicted Trump would fail because he believed Trump's ideas were self-contradictory.[191] Soros also said he believed Trump was preparing for a trade war and expected financial markets to do poorly.[192] In October 2011, Soros drafted an open letter entitled \"As concerned Europeans we urge Eurozone leaders to unite\",[193] in which he calls for a stronger economic government for Europe using federal means (Common EU treasury, common fiscal supervision, etc.) and warns against the danger of nationalistic solutions to the Great Recession. The letter was co-signed by Javier Solana, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, Andrew Duff, Emma Bonino, Massimo D'Alema, and Vaira VÄ«Ä·e-Freiberga. In October 2015, Soros criticized Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n and his handling of the 2015 European migrant crisis: \"His plan treats the protection of national borders as the objective and the refugees as an obstacle. Our plan treats the protection of refugees as the objective and national borders as the obstacle.\"[194] Soros expected that Brexit would fail and the Premiership of Theresa May would last only a short time.[192] Soros is opposed to Brexit and donated Â£400,000 to the anti-Brexit 'Best for Britain' group.[195] Soros also hosted a dinner for Conservative donors at his London home to encourage them to follow his lead. Soros's Open Society Foundations also donated a total of Â£303,000 to two pro-EU organizations, the European Movement UK and Scientists for EU, and a center-right think-tank, Bright Blue.[196] In 2018, Soros highlighted that Europe faces major challenges related to immigration, austerity, and nations leaving the EU.[197] He holds that Europe is facing an existential crisis, in view of the rise of populism, the refugee crisis and a growing rift between Europe and the United States.[198] Soros has also stated that \"the euro has many unresolved problems\" which \"must not be allowed to destroy the European Union\". He advocated replacing the notion of a multi-speed Europe by the aim of a \"multi-track Europe\" that would allow member states a wider variety of choices.[199] In view of the possibility of a further increase of the number of refugees from Africa to Europe, Soros proposes that the European Union devise a \"Marshall Plan for Africa\" (see Marshall Plan), fostering education and employment in Africa in order to reduce emigration.[197][199] Soros has expressed concern about the growth of Chinese economic and political power, saying, \"China has risen very rapidly by looking out for its own interests ... They have now got to accept responsibility for world order and the interests of other people as well\". Regarding the political gridlock in America, he said, \"Today, China has not only a more vigorous economy but actually a better functioning government than the United States\".[200] In July 2015, Soros stated that a \"strategic partnership between the US and China could prevent the evolution of two power blocks that may be drawn into military conflict\".[201] In January 2016, during an interview at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Soros stated that \"[a] hard landing is practically unavoidable\". Chinese state media responded by stating \"Soros' challenge to the RMB and Hong Kong dollar are doomed to fail, without any doubt\".[202] In January 2019, Soros used his annual speech at the World Economic Forum, in Davos, to label Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and President of China, as the \"most dangerous opponent of open societies\", saying: \"China is not the only authoritarian regime in the world but it is the wealthiest, strongest and technologically most advanced\". He also urged the United States not to allow the Chinese technology companies Huawei and ZTE to dominate the 5G telecommunications market as this would present an \"unacceptable security risk for the rest of the world\".[203][204] Soros also criticized the newest form of China's Big Brother-like system of mass surveillance called the Social Credit System, saying it would give Xi \"total control\" over the people of China.[205] Additionally, Soros is very critical of American companies that ignore Chinese human rights violations for business reasons, for example slamming BlackRock's decision to invest big in China as detrimental to worldwide democracy and US national security.[206] In May 2014, Soros told CNN's Fareed Zakaria: \"I set up a foundation in Ukraine before Ukraine became independent from Russia. And the foundation has been functioning ever since and played an important part in events now.\"[207] In January 2015, he said that \"Europe needs to wake up and recognize that it is under attack from Russia\" and urged Western countries to expand economic sanctions against Russia for its support of separatists in eastern Ukraine.[208] In January 2015, Soros called on the European Union to give $50 billion of bailout money to Ukraine.[209] In July 2015, Soros stated that Putin's annexation of Crimea was a challenge to the \"prevailing world order\", specifically the European Union. He hypothesized that Putin wants to \"destabilize all of Ukraine by precipitating a financial and political collapse for which he can disclaim responsibility, while avoiding occupation of a part of eastern Ukraine, which would then depend on Russia for economic support\".[201] In November 2015, Russia banned the Open Society Foundations (OSF) and the Open Society Institute (OSI)âtwo pro-democracy charities founded by Sorosâstating they posed a \"threat to the foundations of the constitutional system of the Russian Federation and the security of the state\".[210][211] In January 2016, 53 books related to Soros's \"Renewal of Humanitarian Education\" program were withdrawn at the Vorkuta Mining and Economic College in the Komi Republic, with 427 additional books seized for shredding. A Russian intergovernmental letter released in December 2015 stated that Soros's charities were \"forming a perverted perception of history and making ideological directives, alien to Russian ideology, popular\". Most of these books were published with funds donated by Soros's charities.[212][213] In May 2022, Soros stated that the Russian invasion of Ukraine may be the start of \"a third world war\" and that Putin must be defeated \"as soon as possible\". He also stated that \"Other issues that concern all of humanityâfighting pandemics and climate change, avoiding nuclear war, maintaining global institutionsâhave had to take a back seat to that struggle. That's why I say civilization may not survive.\"[214] In February 2023, Soros criticized Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his alleged Islamophobia, cronyism and authoritarianism, saying that \"India is...a democracy. But its leader, Narendra Modi, is no democrat. Inciting violence against Muslims was an important factor in his meteoric rise.\"[215] Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party accused Soros of trying to undermine Indian democracy.[216] Indian foreign minister S. Jaishankar claimed that Soros is a \"dangerous\" person.[217] India allegedly ran a disinformation campaign against Soros.[218] As of March 2020[update], Forbes magazine listed Soros as the 162nd richest person in the world, with a net worth of $8.3 billion.[219] He has also donated 64% of his original fortune, and distributed more than $15 billion through his Open Society Foundations (an international grantmaking network that supports advancing justice, education, public health and independent media). Forbes has called him the most generous giver (when measured as a percentage of net worth).[12] Soros has been active as a philanthropist since the 1970s, when he began providing funds to help black students attend the University of Cape Town in apartheid South Africa,[107] and began funding dissident movements behind the Iron Curtain.[citation needed] Soros's philanthropic funding includes efforts to promote non-violent democratization in the post-communist states. These efforts, mostly in Central and Eastern Europe, occur primarily through the Open Society Foundations (originally Open Society Institute or OSI) and national Soros Foundations, which sometimes go under other names (such as the Stefan Batory Foundation in Poland). As of 2003, PBS estimated that he had given away a total of $4 billion.[88] The OSI says it has spent about $500 million annually in recent years. In 2003, former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker wrote in the foreword of Soros's book The Alchemy of Finance: George Soros has made his mark as an enormously successful speculator, wise enough to largely withdraw when still way ahead of the game. The bulk of his enormous winnings is now devoted to encouraging transitional and emerging nations to become \"open societies\", open not only in the sense of freedom of commerce butâmore importantâtolerant of new ideas and different modes of thinking and behavior.[220] Time magazine in 2007 cited two specific projectsâ$100 million toward Internet infrastructure for regional Russian universities, and $50 million for the Millennium Promise to eradicate extreme poverty in Africaânoting that Soros had given $742 million to projects in the U.S., and given away a total of more than $7 billion.[221] Other notable projects have included aid to scientists and universities throughout central and eastern Europe, help to civilians during the siege of Sarajevo, and Transparency International. Soros also pledged an endowment of â¬420 million to the Central European University (CEU). According to National Review Online[222] the Open Society Institute gave $20,000 in September 2002 to the Defense Committee of Lynne Stewart, the lawyer who has defended controversial, poor, and often unpopular defendants in court and was sentenced to 2â 1/3â  years in prison for \"providing material support for a terrorist conspiracy\" via a press conference for a client. An OSI spokeswoman said \"it appeared to us at that time that there was a right-to-counsel issue worthy of our support\", but claimed later requests for support were declined.[citation needed] In September 2006, Soros pledged $50 million to the Millennium Promise, led by economist Jeffrey Sachs to provide educational, agricultural, and medical aid to help villages in Africa enduring poverty. The New York Times termed this endeavor a \"departure\" for Soros whose philanthropic focus had been on fostering democracy and good government, but Soros noted that most poverty resulted from bad governance.[223] In May 2011, Soros donated $60 million to Bard College, establishing the Bard College Center for Civic Engagement.[224] Soros played a role in the peaceful transition from communism to democracy in Hungary (1984â89)[25] and provided a substantial endowment to Central European University in Budapest.[225] The Open Society Foundations has active programs in more than 60 countries around the world with total expenditures currently averaging approximately $600 million a year.[3][226] On October 17, 2017, it was announced that Soros had transferred $18 billion to the Open Society Foundations.[227] In October 2018, Soros donated $2 million to the Wikimedia Foundation via the Wikimedia Endowment program.[228] In January 2020, Soros announced a $1 billion endowment donation at the World Economic Forum, establishing the Open Society University Network a global network of educational institutions in partnership with Bard College and the Central European University.[229] Bard College president Leon Botstein serves as chancellor of the Open Society University Network.[230] In July 2020, Soros's Foundations announced plans to give $220 million in grants for racial justice groups, criminal justice reform and civic engagement.[231] In July 2020, Soros donated $100 million to Bard College, to strengthen and expand Bard's Center for Civic Engagement initiatives, and its leadership role as a founding partner of the Open Society University Network.[232] In April 2021, Soros pledged $500 million to the endowment of Bard College. The donation sits among the largest ever made to higher education in the United States.[233] Following the $500 million donation Soros donated $25 million to the Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College in August 2021,[234] as well as an additional $25 million donation to Bard in September 2022.[235] Soros has been married three times and divorced twice. In 1960, he married Annaliese Witschak (born January 3, 1934). Annaliese was an ethnic German immigrant, who had been orphaned during the war. Although she was not Jewish, she was well-liked by Soros's parents, as she had also experienced the privation and displacement brought about by World War II.[236] They divorced in 1983. They had three children: In 1983, George Soros married Susan Weber. They divorced in 2005. They have two children: As a child, Soros fantasized about being a God.[242] In his book Underwriting Democracy, he wrote, \"If truth be known, I carried some rather potent messianic fantasies with me from childhood, which I felt I had to control, otherwise they might get me in trouble.\"[243] He later elaborated on that passage in an interview saying, \"It is a sort of disease when you consider yourself some kind of god, the creator of everything, but I feel comfortable about it now since I began to live it out.\"[244] In a 1998 interview with CBS News, Soros said he was not religious and does not believe in God.[245] In 2008, Soros met Tamiko Bolton;[246] they married on September 21, 2013.[247] His older brother, Paul Soros, a private investor and philanthropist, died on June 15, 2013.[248] As of 2022[update], Soros owned homes on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, in The Hamptons on Long Island, and in Katonah, New York, within Westchester County.[13] In December 2023, Soros was swatted during a period of similar harassment targeting American political figures.[249] Soros has received honorary doctoral degrees from the New School for Social Research in New York, the University of Oxford in 1980, the Corvinus University of Budapest, and a Doctor of Humane Letters from Yale University in 1991.[250][251] He received an honorary laurea degree in economics from the University of Bologna in 1995.[252][251] In 2005, Soros was a minority partner in a group that tried to buy the Washington Nationals, a Major League baseball team. Some Republican lawmakers suggested that they might move to revoke Major League Baseball's antitrust exemption if Soros bought the team.[253] In 2008, Soros's name was associated with AS Roma, an Italian association football team, but the club was not sold. Soros was a financial backer of Washington Soccer L.P., the group that owned the operating rights to Major League Soccer club D.C. United when the league was founded in 1995, but the group lost these rights in 2000.[254] On August 21, 2012, BBC reported SEC filings showing Soros acquired roughly a 2% stake in English football club Manchester United through the purchase of 3 million of the club's Class-A shares.[255] In 2008, Soros was inducted into Institutional Investors Alpha's Hedge Fund Manager Hall of Fame along with Alfred Jones, Bruce Kovner, David Swensen, Jack Nash, James Simons, Julian Roberston, Kenneth Griffin, Leon Levy, Louis Bacon, Michael Steinhardt, Paul Tudor Jones, Seth Klarman, and Steven A. Cohen.[256] In January 2014, Soros was ranked number 1 in LCH Investments list of top 20 managers having posting gains of almost $42 billion since the launch of his Quantum Endowment Fund in 1973.[257] In July 2017, Soros was elected an Honorary Fellow of the British Academy (HonFBA), the United Kingdom's national academy for the humanities and social sciences.[258] Soros was the Financial Times Person of the Year for 2018, with the FT describing him as \"a standard bearer for liberal democracy, an idea under siege from populists\".[259] In April 2019, Soros was awarded the Ridenhour Prize for Courage.[260] In his acceptance address Soros said: \"In my native Hungary, the government of [Prime Minister] Viktor OrbÃ¡n has turned me into the super villain of an alleged plot to destroy the supposed Christian identity of the Hungarian nation... [I] donate the prize money associated with this award to the Hungarian Spectrum, an online English-language publication that provides daily updates on Hungarian politics. It renders an important service by exposing to the world [in English] what Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n is telling his own people [in Hungarian]. It [Hungarian Spectrum] deserves to be better known and supported.\"[261] In January 2025, United States President Joe Biden awarded Soros the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[262]",

                "content": "Receive George Sorosâs articles and essays by mail. George Soros is one of the worldâs foremost philanthropists. He has given away more than $32 billion of his personal fortune to fund the Open Society Foundationsâ work around the world. He is also the founder and primary funder of the Central European University in Budapest, a leading regional center for the study of the social sciences. Under his leadership, the Open Society Foundations have supported individuals and organizations across the globe fighting for freedom of expression, accountable government, and societies that promote justice and equality. The foundations have also provided school and university fees for thousands of promising students who would otherwise have been excluded from opportunities because of their identity or where they live. This giving has often focused on those who face discrimination purely for who they are. He has supported groups representing Europeâs Roma people, and others pushed to the margins of mainstream society, such as drug users, sex workers, and LGBTI people. Soros has experienced such intolerance firsthand. Born in Hungary in 1930, he lived through the Nazi occupation of 1944â1945, which resulted in the murder of over 500,000 Hungarian Jews. His own Jewish family survived by securing false identity papers, concealing their backgrounds, and helping others do the same. Soros later recalled that âinstead of submitting to our fate, we resisted an evil force that was much stronger than we wereâyet we prevailed. Not only did we survive, but we managed to help others.â As the Communists consolidated power in Hungary after the war, Soros left Budapest in 1947 for London, working part-time as a railway porter and as a night-club waiter to support his studies at the London School of Economics. In 1956, he emigrated to the United States, entering the world of finance and investments, where he was to make his fortune. In 1970, he launched his own hedge fund, Soros Fund Management, and went on to become one of the most successful investors in the history of the United States. Soros used his fortune to create the Open Society Foundationsâa network of foundations, partners, and projects in more than 100 countries. Their name and work reflect the influence on Sorosâs thinking of the philosophy of Karl Popper, which Soros first encountered at the London School of Economics. In his book Open Society and Its Enemies, Popper argues that no philosophy or ideology is the final arbiter of truth, and that societies can only flourish when they allow for democratic governance, freedom of expression, and respect for individual rightsâan approach at the core of the Open Society Foundationsâ work. Soros began his philanthropy in 1979, giving scholarships to black South Africans under apartheid. In the 1980s, he helped promote the open exchange of ideas in Communist Hungary, by funding academic visits to the West, and supporting fledgling independent cultural groups and other initiatives. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, he created the Central European University as a space to foster critical thinkingâat that time an alien concept at most universities in the former Communist bloc. With the Cold War over, he gradually expanded his philanthropy to the United States, Africa, Latin America, and Asia, supporting a vast array of new efforts to create more accountable, transparent, and democratic societies. He was one of the early prominent voices to criticize the war on drugs as âarguably more harmful than the drug problem itself,â and helped kick-start Americaâs medical marijuana movement. In the early 2000s, he became a vocal backer of same-sex marriage efforts. Though his causes evolved over time, they continued to hew closely to his ideals of an open society.

Under George Sorosâs leadership, the Open Society Foundations support individuals and organizations across the globe fighting for freedom of expression, accountable government, and societies that promote justice and equality. George Soros experienced ethnic and political intolerance firsthand. Born in Hungary in 1930, he lived through the Nazi occupation of 1944â1945, which resulted in the murder of over 500,000 Hungarian Jews. His own Jewish family survived by securing false identity papers, concealing their backgrounds, and helping others do the same. Soros later recalled that ânot only did we survive, but we managed to help others.â â1944, the year of the German occupation, was my formative experience. Instead of submitting to our fate we resisted an evil force that was much stronger than we wereâyet we prevailed.â âGeorge Soros As the Communists consolidated power in Hungary after the war, Soros left Budapest in 1947 for London, working part-time as a railway porter and as a night-club waiter to support his studies at the London School of Economics. In 1956, he emigrated to the United States, entering the world of finance and investments, where he made his fortune. In 1970, he launched his own hedge fund and went on to become one of the most successful investors in the history of the United States. George Soros used his fortune to create the Open Society Foundationsâa network of foundations, partners, and projects in more than 120 countries. Our name and work reflect the influence on Sorosâs thinking of the philosophy of Karl Popper, which Soros first encountered at the London School of Economics. In his book Open Society and Its Enemies, Popper argues that no philosophy or ideology is the final arbiter of truth, and that societies can only flourish when they allow for democratic governance, freedom of expression, and respect for individual rightsâan approach at the core of the Open Society Foundationsâ work. George Soros began his philanthropy in 1979, giving scholarships to Black South Africans under apartheid. In the 1980s, he helped promote the open exchange of ideas in Communist Hungary by funding academic visits to the West and supporting fledgling independent cultural groups, as well as other initiatives. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, he created Central European University as a space to foster critical thinkingâwhich at that time was an alien concept for most universities in the former Communist bloc. With the Cold War over, he gradually expanded his philanthropy to Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the United States, supporting a vast array of new efforts to create more accountable, transparent, and democratic societies. He was one of the early prominent voices to criticize the war on drugs as âarguably more harmful than the drug problem itself,â and helped kick-start Americaâs medical marijuana movement. In the early 2000s, he became a vocal backer of same-sex marriage efforts. Though his causes have evolved over time, they continue to hew closely to his ideals of an open society. His giving has reached beyond his own Foundations, supporting independent organizations such as Global Witness, the International Crisis Group, the European Council on Foreign Relations, and the Institute for New Economic Thinking.

In 2017, the Open Society Foundations announced that Soros had transferred $18 billion of his fortune towards funding the future work of the Foundations, bringing his total giving to the Foundations since 1984 to over $32 billion. âI believe that in philanthropy one should do the right thing, whether or not it succeeds.â âGeorge Soros Throughout Sorosâs philanthropic career, one thing has remained constant: a commitment to fighting the worldâs most intractable problems. He has been known to emphasize the importance of tackling losing causes. Indeed, many of the issues Soros has taken onâand he would be the first to admit thisâare the types of issues for which a complete solution might never emerge. âMy success in the financial markets has given me a greater degree of independence than most other people,â Soros once wrote.

                "title": "George Soros | Biography & Facts | Britannica Money",
                "content": "George Soros (born August 12, 1930, Budapest, Hungary) is a Hungarian-born American financier, author, philanthropist, and activist whose success as an investor made him one of the wealthiest men in the world. He is also known as a powerful and influential supporter of liberal social causes. Soros, who was born into a prosperous Jewish family, had his upbringing disrupted by the Nazisâ arrival in Hungary in 1944. The family split up and used false papers to avoid being sent to concentration camps. In 1947 they moved to London. Soros studied philosophy under Karl Popper at the London School of Economics, but he abandoned his plans to become a philosopher. He joined the London merchant bank Singer & Friedlander. In 1956 he moved to New York City, where he worked initially as an analyst of European securities and rapidly made his mark. In 1973 Soros established the Soros Fund (later Quantum Endowment Fund), a hedge fund that subsequently spawned a range of associated companies. His daring investment decisions caused the funds to grow rapidly, but not all his gambles succeeded. He correctly foresaw the worldwide stock market crash of October 1987âbut wrongly predicted that Japanese stocks would fall hardest of all. Sorosâs status as an almost mythical financier was established in September 1992 when the British government devalued the pound sterling. Through his Quantum group of companies, Soros had sold billions of pounds during the days preceding devaluation, much of it purchased with borrowed money. Afterward Soros bought back pounds, repaid the money he had borrowed, and made a profit of about $1 billion. Others also profited from the poundâs fall, but the scale of Sorosâs operations dwarfed those of everyone else, and the gambit earned him the nickname âthe man who broke the Bank of England.â In 1994, however, his instincts appeared to fail himâat least temporarilyâas he speculated that the dollar would rise in value against the Japanese yen. Instead, the dollar fell all year, and the Quantum Fund reportedly lost hundreds of millions on a single day in February. Although he denied involvement in speculative attacks on the Thai baht in 1997, Sorosâs name was soon linked with the financial crisis that swept Asia the following year. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad singled out Soros, stating that he was responsible for the decline of the ringgit. In reality, Sorosâs funds had lost billions as a result of the crisis. Soros recovered with early gains on Internet stocks in 1999, but his investment style became more conservative in the wake of the implosion of the technology bubble in 2000. In December 2002 a French court convicted Soros of insider trading for a 1988 stock deal involving financial services company SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale, and he was fined â¬2.2 million ($2.9 million). Soros appealed the ruling, but it was upheld by the Cour de Cassation (Franceâs highest court) in 2006. Facing new federal regulations concerning hedge funds, Soros announced in July 2011 that the Quantum Endowment Fund would no longer manage the money of outside investors. Instead, it would only handle the assets of Soros and his family. In 1984 Soros used some of his profits to create the Open Society Foundations, a philanthropic organization that included a network of foundations. Much of the initial work focused on eastern Europeâstarting with Hungary, where he awarded scholarships, provided technical assistance, and helped modernize schools and businesses. Even though Hungary was still a communist state, Soros obtained guarantees that his foundation could operate without government interference. As the Cold War ended and the Soviet regime collapsed, Soros established foundations in Czechoslovakia, Poland, Russia, and Yugoslavia. Some critics argued that he was being inconsistentâcondemning âshort-termismâ in Western governments while making money from short-term currency speculation. However, he continued to spend significant sums to help establish democracy in eastern Europe and elsewhere. In the early 21st century Open Society Foundations was active in more than 70 countries. In 2017 it was reported that Soros had given some $18 billion to the organization in recent years, making it one of the worldâs largest philanthropic groups. Soros was also involved in political activism and other philanthropic efforts. In 2003 he provided start-up funding for the liberal think tank the Center for American Progress, and he pledged millions of dollars to groups such as MoveOn.org to oppose the reelection of Pres. George W. Bush, a Republican, in 2004. He later was a prominent supporter of Democratic Sen. Barack Obamaâs presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2012, and he donated to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election and to Joe Biden in 2020. In 2010 Soros gave $100 million to the nongovernmental organization Human Rights Watch. With his support of Democrats and liberal causes, Soros frequently drew criticism from Republicans and conservatives, and he was often the focus of unfounded conspiracy theories. Soros wrote several books, including The Alchemy of Finance (1987), The Crisis of Global Capitalism: Open Society Endangered (1998), and The New Paradigm for Financial Markets: The Credit Crisis of 2008 and What It Means (2008). He was the subject of the documentary Soros (2019).",

                "title": "Barbastro 0-4 FC Barcelona: Comfortably through",
                "content": "First Team Club Tickets & Museum Download the official FC Barcelona App FC Barcelona are through to the last sixteen of the Copa del Rey after a comfortable victory over lower league outfit Barbastro on Saturday. A rather lop-sided affair only ever looked like having one winner with goals from Eric GarcÃ­a, Robert Lewandowski (2) and Pablo Torre securing a 4-0 win that is the ideal send-off for the players, who will now be jetting off to Saudi Arabia to play in the Spanish Super Cup. The draw for the next round, also to be played over a single leg, is next Wednesday 8 and the matches themselves are being played the week after. There were already two highlights in Hansi Flickâs starting XI. The first was the presence of Wojciech SzczÄsny in goal for the very first time and the second was the return from a 181-day absence injury of Ronald Araujo, and wearing the captainâs armband no less. Whatâs more, Ansu Fati made his own comeback from a fitness issue as a second half substitute. And towards the end of the game, BarÃ§a AtlÃ¨ticâs16-year-old Toni Fernandez came on for his first ever minutes with the senior team, and in his short time on pitch managed to get involved in a number of promising plays. The only downside of BarÃ§aâs commanding display is that SzczÄsny never really got the chance to show us what he is made of. The Polish stopper barely had to make a single intervention of consequence as BarÃ§a utterly dominated an opponent that plays four tiers below them in Segunda FederaciÃ³n. But Araujo made an immediate impact. Moments after having a great chance brilliantly saved by the home keeper, the Uruguayan rose to meet a Frenkie de Jongâs long cross and set up a diving header from Eric GarcÃ­a to score BarÃ§aâs first goal of 2025 on 21 minutes. While Barbastro had put up an impressive fight in this same fixture 12 months earlier, this time they were very much made to look second best. The playing surface wasnât perfect, but BarÃ§a were circulating the ball at ease and turning almost every possession into chances. Ten minutes after taking the lead, Lewandowski doubled up by heading home a Pablo Torre free kick. The Barbastro supporters may have been dreaming of a cupset all week, but the way BarÃ§a were controlling this game, the chances of that happening were already looking slim when a third goal as good as ended the contest with 45 minutes of football still to play. Fermin Lopez, who had already hit the crossbar earlier threaded an assist to Lewandowski, and the Poleâs composed finish made it 3-0. And then a horrendous error from the home goalkeeper left Pablo Torre alone with the ball in front of goal, and free to tap home the easiest goal he is ever likely to score. Now it was four. A gift of a goal, maybe, but thoroughly deserved by a player whose performance this evening will surely have made an impression on Hansi Flick. From there on, it was just a question of playing out the final minutes. Barbastro were outclassed in their attempts to at least delight their fans with a consolation goal, and despite a heavily rotated bench, BarÃ§a continued to press for a fifth that never came. The game did produced one moment of major concern when IÃ±igo Martinez clashed heads with Jaime Ara of the home side. The latter came off the worst and was stretchered off to an ovation from the home fans. Here at BarÃ§a we also wish the player a rapid recovery. And on a cheerier note, we also wish all the best to Barbastro's Israel Garcia, who following the final whistle went over and proposed to his girlfriend! That's not something we get too often in BarÃ§a matches! Next stop for BarÃ§a, Saudi Arabia!",

                "content": "Manchester City thrashed West Ham United 4-1 in the Premier League on Saturday for their first back-to-back wins since October thanks to two goals from Erling Haaland and one of their best all-around performances in weeks. The reigning champions are sixth in the table on 34 points, 11 behind leaders Liverpool who have two games in hand. The Hammers, who were coming off a 5-0 rout by Liverpool six days earlier, are 13th with 23 points. City got on the scoresheet in the 10th minute when United defender Vladimir Coufal deflected Savinhoâs angled shot into the far corner. Haaland bagged his first in the 42nd minute when Savinho whipped in a long cross that the big Norwegian leapt sideways to head in. Haaland notched his second shortly after the break when Savinho sent a through ball that the 24-year-old nonchalantly chipped over goalkeeper Alphonse Areola. Phil Foden padded Cityâs lead in the 58th minute before Niclas Fullkrug pulled a late goal back for the Hammers, but the game was already well out of reach.

Despite looking the more dynamic side in the opening period of play, the Hammers were punished for a lack of clinical finishing and were undone at the other end just 10 minutes in, when Savinhoâs shot was turned past Areola by an unwitting Coufal. Despite more good work from Lopeteguiâs side in the interim, they were pegged back once again three minutes from half-time, with Haaland leaping to connect with Savinhoâs cross to double Cityâs advantage. Within a quarter-hour of the restart, West Ham found themselves 4-0 behind, thanks to a second goal from Haaland - and assist from Savinho - before a mistake in possession allowed De Bruyne to set Foden up with a close-range finish. The visitors did manage to pull one back through Fullkrugâs second goal of the season with 19 minutes to play but it was too little, too late for the Irons, who lose by three goals despite closer-than-expected xG totals, with Guardiolaâs team leading the way 1.97 to 1.19. The three points keeps Manchester City in sixth place in the league, and theyâll host Salford City next weekend in the FA Cup. West Ham stay 13th and have Premier League opponents coming up in the FA cup, as they travel to play Aston Villa in six days. That concludes our commentary of the Premier League fixture between Manchester City and West Ham - we hope youâve enjoyed it! 16:56 Manchester City are looking to run out the clock in an effort to see out the three-goal victory, with Guardiola eager to register back-to-back victories in any competition for the first time since October 2024. West Ham, on the other hand, will likely fall to two-consecutive losses for the first time since the beginning of December, when they were defeated by Arsenal and Leicester City. 16:56 FULL-TIME: MANCHESTER CITY 4-1 WEST HAM 16:53 Foden plays a pass across the face of the 18-yard box for Grealish with Silva running the opposite direction to draw defenders away, but the England international is unable to hit the target after stepping inside, with his right-footed shot blocked behind for a corner by a combination of Coufal and Mavropanos. 16:50 The fourth official indicates six minutes will be added to the end of the match for stoppages. 16:50 Haaland has scored nine goals in just six Premier League games against West Ham including today, with 33.3 per cent of those strikes coming at the Etihad Stadium. 16:45 Substitution Edson Omar Ãlvarez VelÃ¡zquez Daniel William John Ings 16:45 JUST WIDE! Alvarez shows off his footwork, dribbling past Walker in a tight area before leaving the ball for Paqueta, whose first-time shot is blazed wide of the post! 16:43 Paquetaâs outswinging corner finds the unmarked Soucek 14 yards from goal, but the captain fails to hit the target with his header. 16:43 Substitution Erling Braut Haaland Jack Peter Grealish 16:42 Paqueta plays a long ball over the top of the Manchester City defence from inside his own half for Fullkrug, who latches onto it before holding up play ahead of two centre-backs and laying it off to Summerville. The winger attempts an acrobatic, off-balance effort from close range but it fails to come off, with Ortega not called into action. 16:39 McAtee is given 10 minutes to impress, with Savinho given an early rest after an impressive performance. 16:39 Guilhermeâs cross towards the penalty spot is chested down by Fullkrug, allowing Wan-Bissaka to strike the ball from 20 yards out, but the full-back drives his wild effort wide of the near post. 16:37 Carson has retaken his place on the bench as Ortega looks capable of continuing - at least for now - with the starting goalkeeper keen to see out the game. 16:35 With Ortega on the ground receiving treatment, and Ederson unavailable due to injury, 39-year-old Carson is getting prepared to warm up on the touchline, with his presence a potential necessity in the last quarter-hour of the game. The situation draws a wry smile from the backup goalkeeper, who hasnât featured since the 2020/21 season. 16:33 Looking to capitalise on the momentum, Coufal gets forward down the right and hangs an inviting cross to the far post for Soucek, who nods the ball back into the six-yard box for Fullkrug. Ortega is first on the scene and gets two hands to the ball but leaps over the back of the striker to do so, before landing awkwardly. 16:30 Substitution Mohammed Kudus Luis Guilherme Lira dos Santos 16:29 Goal Niclas FÃ¼llkrug 16:29 Summerville floats a cross-cum-shot towards the back post but he fails to hit the target while also sending the ball just above the head of the awaiting Kudus - giving Ortega a goal-kick. 16:27 Paqueta cleverly chips a pass over the top of the Manchester City defence for Soucek, who lunges forward to poke the ball towards goal. Ortega manages to time his step to perfection though and blocks the effort with his chest, while also pushing it to safety to prevent a follow-up chance. 16:24 JUST OVER! Paqueta steps up and curls his left-footed free-kick up and over the wall, but the ball fails to come back down in time and lands on the roof of the goal! 16:23 In 2024, West Ham conceded more goals than any other Premier League side (79), finishing the year with a 5-0 home defeat against Liverpool. 16:22 Yellow Card Kyle Andrew Walker 16:21 It looks to be a long way back for West Ham, who havenât been able to replicate any of the positives from the first half, while making a number of mistakes that has led to an even greater deficit. Theyâve seen more of the ball since the restart but done less with it, firing just three shots to an xG of 0.09 in the quarter-hour since the second-half kicked off. 16:20 Substitution Nathan Benjamin AkÃ© Kyle Andrew Walker 16:20 Substitution Mateo KovaÄiÄ Ä°lkay GÃ¼ndoÄan 16:17 Assist Kevin De Bruyne 16:17 Haaland has scored his 16th goal of the Premier League this season, more than any other Manchester City player, while netting twice in the same game for the first time since September 14 against Brentford. 16:16 Goal Philip Walter Foden 16:14 Goal Erling Braut Haaland 16:13 Play is brought to a halt for Haaland, who is down on the pitch holding a very sensitive area after holding the ball up for Silva in midfield. Heâs eventually able to climb back to his feet but he looks to be in some discomfort as he attempts to run off the issue. 16:12 Substitution Jean-Clair Dimitri Roger Todibo Konstantinos Mavropanos 16:10 Coufal fires a first-time shot towards the goal after Kudusâ shot is blocked from close range by Gvardiol, but Ortega throws up an arm to block the strike, while keeping the ball in play. 16:08 West Ham have conceded 21 first-half goals in 20 games, only Southampton (22) and Leicester City (22) have conceded more in the Premier League this season. 16:06 Alvarezâs cross from a central position to the edge of the six-yard box is headed on by Summerville ahead of Lewis, but the winger can only pop his effort up to provide Ortega with an easy catch. 16:04 West Ham get the match restarted from the kick-off! 15:52 West Ham are left with little alternative but to open up and attack as they continue to search for a way back in the game. The absence of Bowen is an issue for the attack, but Soler and Ings - who could make his 400th appearance in club football - are options off the bench for Lopetegui; especially as Fullkrug has already been booked. Guardiola will be keen for a second clean sheet in-a-row and could introduce veterans Gundogan and Walker to see out the result in the second half, while Doku is a likely entrant to stretch the pitch late in place of Foden. 15:50 Manchester City take a two-goal advantage into the half-time interval at the Etihad Stadium, leading West Ham 2-0, though it has been a much tighter match than the score line suggests. The visitors started the brighter of the two sides and fashioned two half-chances within the first nine minutes, with Kudus looking a lively outlet on the right flank, but they were unable to make the most of their opportunities, and were duly punished at the other end with Coufalâs own goal at the 10th minute following Savinhoâs shot. While the lead seemed to give the hosts confidence, they were unable to completely shut down their opponents, who continued to trouble on the counter-attack , only to be let down by their finishing. Areola made a couple of good saves to end the half but it wasnât enough, as Haaland popped up with three minutes to go and outjumped Kilman to win a back-post header and double Cityâs lead. Despite being outproduced in xG for large parts of the half, Guardiolaâs side lead in the metric 0.95 to 0.52, after having taken the lead with an expected goals of just 0.02. 15:48 HALF-TIME: MANCHESTER CITY 2-0 WEST HAM 15:47 The fourth official indicates one minute will be added to the end of the half for stoppages. 15:43 Assist SÃ¡vio Moreira de Oliveira 15:43 Wan-Bissaka curls a deep cross to the far post from the left wing for Soucek, but itâs easily cleared by the head of Gvardiol. 15:41 GOOD SHOT - BETTER SAVE! Savinho uses close control to dribble into the penalty area before playing a square pass to an unmarked Lewis 20 yards from goal. With time and space, the full-back winds up and places a powerful shot to the top corner but Areola leaps across his line and claws the ball away with two hands! 15:38 Manchester City have won all eight of their Premier League home games against West Ham under Pep Guardiola â only Arsene Wenger has a better 100 per cent home win rate against an opponent in the competition (11/11 vs Leicester, 10/10 vs Stoke). 15:37 Having worked out Manchester Cityâs tactics, Summerville immediately charges forward after De Bruyne plays his corner short to Savinho and intercepts the return before sprinting away on the counter. After spotting Kudus in support, he squares the ball to his team-mate, who fails to hit the target with his shot thanks in part to Foden closing down the angle. 15:35 GREAT WORK FROM AREOLA! De Bruyne threads a pass through the West Ham defence for Haaland, who gets into the penalty area before cutting back to play the ball square to Silva. Unmarked, the Portugal international lashes a first-time effort towards goal through the legs of Wan-Bissaka, but Areola gets down quickly and manages to make the save with his legs! 15:33 Savinho gets to the edge of Areolaâs penalty area and looks to have a shot but he slips during his dispatch, which provides the West Ham goalkeeper with an easy save. 15:30 CHANCE! Paqueta finds himself in a pocket of space 20 yards from goal and turns before dragging a left-footed shot through the crowd of bodies and wide of the far post! 15:29 Kovacicâs poorly timed sliding challenge through the back of Summerville inside the centre-circle earns the Croatia international a yellow card. 15:28 West Ham have conceded at least once in each of their last 24 Premier League games against Manchester City â only against Sunderland have they had a longer run without a clean sheet in their league history (25 between 1923 and 1968), a run they ended with an 8-0 win with Geoff Hurst scoring six goals. 15:26 Wan-Bissaka and Paqueta play a lovely give-and-go inside Manchester Cityâs 18-yard box, with the full-back teasing a lovely pass back to the penalty spot, but no West Ham player in the area gambles to attack the delivery, allowing Savinho to calmly dribble the ball away. 15:24 Summerville looks to be through on goal, with the entire Manchester City half at his mercy after the winger storms through to steal the ball from Akanji following a free-kick, but referee Michael Salisbury blows his whistle for a foul during the tackle - much to the frustration of the visiting players. 15:23 West Ham again look to play it out from the back, taking a risk as they draw in the Manchester City press, but again Kudus is a lively outlet down the flank, attacking Soucekâs hurried pass before beating Kovacic to the ball to force a sliding clearance. 15:20 Despite taking the lead after just 10 minutes, Manchester City still technically havenât had a shot on target, creating an xG of just 0.02 for their lead, while West Ham are forced to search for an equaliser after an output of 0.33. 15:18 From the left, De Bruyne this time plays a pass to Savinho from the corner-kick before sweeping a first-time cross into the 18-yard box thatâs met by Kilmanâs clearing header. 15:17 Savinho again gets the better of Coufal and plays a low pass into the penalty area looking for the run of Silva at the near post, but a sliding Soucek puts it behind for a third Manchester City corner. 15:15 Yellow Card Niclas FÃ¼llkrug 15:14 De Bruyne and Silva attempt a short-corner routine, but Coufal and Soucek are quick to leave their posts and defend, eventually poking the ball behind for a second set-piece. 15:11 SOUCEK CANâT TEST ORTEGA! Again Kudus is causing issues down the right flank, providing an option for Coufal as he drives towards the byline before cutting back a low cross to the penalty spot for the unmarked Soucek. With time and space, the Czechia international goes for it at the first time of asking but drags his effort wide! 15:10 Own goal VladimÃ­r Coufal 15:08 SIDE-NETTING! Building out from the back, West Ham manage to suck their opponents in before hitting on the counter, with Fullkrug and Summerville linking up to play Kudus into the penalty area, but the Ghana international is unable to find the target with his right-footed shot from close range, sending his effort into the side of the goal! 15:07 Paquetaâs volleyed pass out to the right flank for Kudus is tracked down by the winger, who takes on Gvardiol before attempting a cross thatâs easily blocked by the recovering defender. 15:04 Haaland drops back to receive Akeâs pass and play one-touch football with Kovacic, but the offside flag is immediately raised - giving West Ham a chance to regain possession in midfield. 15:03 Foden slips a pass to the byline from a position deep on the right wing looking for the incisive run of Lewis, who keeps the ball in play before digging out an off-balance cross that hits the side-netting. 15:01 Manchester City get the match under way from the kick-off! 14:48 West Ham make four alterations from the side that lost 5-0 to Liverpool on Sunday. Todibo is preferred to Mavropanos in defence, while Soucek gets the nod in midfield ahead of Soler. Summerville replaces the uninvolved Emerson Palmieri on the left flank and in attack, an injury to Jarrod Bowen sees Fullkrug lead the line. 14:48 Manchester City name an unchanged XI from the side that beat Leicester City six days ago. Ortega keeps his place between the posts behind a defence consisting of Gvardiol, Ake, Akanji and Lewis. Kovacic sits in midfield behind Silva and De Bruyne, while Savinho and Foden look to supply Haaland from the wings. 14:48 WEST HAM SUBS: Aaron Cresswell, Carlos Soler, Konstantinos Mavropanos, Luis Guilherme, Danny Ings, Wes Foderingham, Guido Rodriguez, Andy Irving, Ollie Scarles. 14:48 WEST HAM XI (4-2-3-1): Alphonse Areola; Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Maximilian Kilman, Jean-Clair Todibo, Vladimir Coufal; Tomas Soucek, Edson Alvarez; Crysencio Summerville, Lucas Paqueta, Mohammed Kudus; Niclas Fullkrug. 14:48 MANCHESTER CITY SUBS: Kyle Walker, Jack Grealish, Jeremy Doku, Ilkay Gundogan, Matheus Nunes, Scott Carson, Jahmai Simpson-Pusey, Nico OâReilly, James McAtee. 14:48 MANCHESTER CITY XI (4-1-4-1): Stefan Ortega; Josko Gvardiol, Nathan Ake, Manuel Akanji, Rico Lewis; Mateo Kovacic; Savinho, Bernardo Silva, Kevin De Bruyne, Phil Foden; Erling Haaland. 14:48 With 15 minutes to go before kick-off, letâs take a look at how the two sides are lining up - starting with our hosts! 14:37 West Ham's 5-0 defeat at the hands of Liverpool ended a run of four straight games without defeat for Julen Lopetegui's side, who managed eight points in that time. Sitting in 13th position - just one above Manchester United - the Hammers will be eager to take to the pitch after Tottenham's loss earlier today, which gives them the opportunity to finish the day in 11th should they manage a first league win against Manchester City since September 2015. 14:32 Manchester City's 2-0 win over Leicester City last time out was just their second victory in their last 14 fixtures in all competitions and left them in sixth place; four points behind Chelsea for the final Champions League spot and 14 off league-leading Liverpool. Looking to get back to the form that saw them win the Premier League each of the last four seasons, Pep Guardiola could not have hand-picked a better opponent, as Manchester City have beaten todayâs opponents in every one of their last five meetings, with each of the last three games ending 3-1. 14:32 Hello and welcome to our LIVE commentary of the Premier League fixture between Manchester City and West Ham! 13:51 , Mike Jones Man City XI: Ortega Moreno, Lewis, Akanji, Ake, Gvardiol, Kovacic, De Bruyne, Bernardo, Savinho, Foden, Haaland Your first City XI of 2025 ð©µXI | Ortega Moreno, Lewis, Akanji, Ake, Gvardiol, Kovacic, De Bruyne (C), Bernardo, Savinho, Foden, HaalandSUBS | Carson, Walker, Grealish, Doku, Gundogan, Nunes, Simpson-Pusey, O'Reilly, McAtee#ManCity | @etihad pic.twitter.com/lxOUCTmSLw â Manchester City (@ManCity) January 4, 2025 West Ham XI: Areola, Coufal, Todibo, Kilman, Wan-Bissaka, Alvarez, Soucek, Paqueta, Kudos, Fullkrug, Summerville Starting 2025 like this ð pic.twitter.com/z7SojQ32oW â West Ham United (@WestHam) January 4, 2025 13:00 Follow all the goals and latest action from the Premier League here with The Independent.

A fortuitous 2-0 win at Leicester City last weekend did little to mask a stark decline from English football's dominant force of the current era. It was a similar story here despite the scoreline, with City staggeringly easy to play through in transition during the opening stages. Mohammad Kudus and Tomas Soucek each wasted good chances for West Ham before Vladimir Coufal deflected Savinho's drilled cross into his own net. Savinho belatedly scored his first City goal last time out and the resurgent Brazil winger brilliantly created the second in the 42nd minute, taking poor Coufal to the cleaners before hanging up a cross to the back post for Haaland to head gleefully home.

Niclas Fullkrug MORE: All the latest Man City news | Premier League schedule for 2024/25 | Latest Premier League top scorer rankings West Ham then self-destructed before the hour. A rampaging Savinho drove at a tentative defence and Kostas Mavropanos â only just introduced in place of Jean-Clair Tobido â was welcomed to the game by the sight of Haaland running off the back of him to create the angle for a dinked finish past Alphonse Areola. Kudus then added to his list of culpabilities by spinning a suicidal pass back towards his own penalty area and into Kevin De Bruyne's path. The Belgian playmaker had the simple task of giving Phil Foden a simple finish. That felt like an invitation for City to relocate their old swagger but a double change to protect Mateo Kovacic and Nathan Ake saw them return to their skittish ways. Not for the first time since his return from Barcelona, the game completely passed Ilkay Gundogan by. Fellow replacement Kyle Walker was simply by-passed by West Ham time and again. Niclas Fullkrug interspersed his laboured efforts with a goal from Soucek's low ball into the box and Lucas Paqueta and Crysensio Summerville both had chances to set up a nerve-jangling finish. On the back of a 5-0 defeat to Liverpool, this is a bad look for Hammers boss Julen Lopetegui, but his players certainly appeared to still be playing for him during the closing stages. A couple of months into their winter malaise and at least with back-to-back wins for the first time since October, City are somehow still a little harder to fathom right now. Haaland ð¥Foden ð¯Man City get goals number three and four as they cruise to victory. pic.twitter.com/XaArj9ij6Y Manchester City are definitely not out of the woods so far as their recent form goes, but that's a 4-1 victory and back-to-back wins for the first time since October. Not to be sniffed at and Pep Guardiola will prefer addressing problems on the training pitch and (surely) in the transfer market with points on the board. The champions remain sixth and in-touch with fifth-placed Newcastle, who won earlier today. Julen Lopetegui might not have enough credit in the bank to convince anyone his West Ham team were unlucky here, but they kind of were. Thanks for joining us. 90+2 mins: Grealish looking to add gloss to the scoreline has his shot deflected behind by Coufal. A keep-ball short corner ensues. 90 mins: The fourth official has just signalled six minutes of stoppage time. A punter in front of the press box responded by complaining: \"IT'S FREEZING!\". As a man who can no longer feel his toes, I hear you my friend. 86 mins: Deft work from Paqueta, who ghosts past Walker and shoots just wide. West Ham are going to run out of time here but it's remarkable the scoreline isn't closer. 84 mins: Grealish comes on for Haaland, who can be happy with his work today. 83 mins: A lay-off, a pass and again Manchester City's midfield doesn't exist defensively. Walker manages to block Sumemrville's cross. Soucek almost smuggles one in at the near post from the corner. City are winning 4-1, on their way to back-to-back victories for he first time since October and yet it's very hard to call this a good performance. 81 mins: Long ball over the top for Fullkrug, who holds off Gvardiol and tees up Summerville. The winger is stretching, though, loses his footing and clatters his attempt into orbit. 78 mins: The substitution City make is McAtee on for the excellent Savinho and therefore entirely devoid of Barclaysmen. 77 mins: If West Ham get another here, an improbable comeback is on. Wan-Bissaka yahooing one left-footed from 30 yards probably isn't the optimum route to that scenario. Hang about... Scott Carson is warming up. This is not a drill. 76 mins: Ortega still having treatment after said whack. Seems to be a bit winded. The concern on the City bench does not appear to have extended to Scott Carson warming up. Jack Grealish is. Maybe he fancies a go in goal? 74 mins: City at sixes and sevens again. West Ham have men over. Coufal digs out a deep cross for Soucek, who heads back across goal. Ortega gets there ahead of Fullkrug but has taken a whack for his troubles. 70 mins: GOOOOOAAAAAALLLLLL!!!! Niclas Fullkrug West Ham deservedly have one back. City have completed switched off since the hour. They carve down the left flank and Fullkrug tucks Soucek's low ball past his compatriot Ortega into the bottom left corner. 66 mins: A bouncing ball gets into the City box. Soucek is on the end of it but Ortega is out to make a brave save. 65 mins: Lovely effort from the free-kick by Paqueta that ripples the top of Ortega's netting. 64 mins: Summerville darts past Walker, who shoves the winger over and is booked. Again, welcome to the game. 61 mins: Double change for City. Guardiola wishes not to take a chance on Ake's fitness or Kovacic's yellow card. Walker and Gundogan come on. Lewis shuffles over to left-back. 58 mins: GOOOOOAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLL!!!!! Phil Foden Kudus, who botched those chances for West Ham during the first-half, remember, spins a pass back towards his own penalty area. Straight to De Bruyne. Not ideal. He picks out Foden for a simple finish. West Ham have self-destructed here and are suddenly on the way to another hiding. Haaland ð¥Foden ð¯Man City get goals number three and four as they cruise to victory. pic.twitter.com/XaArj9ij6Y 55 mins: GOOOOOAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLL!!!!! Erling Haaland!!!! Savinho, Haaland, goal! It's a nice new trick for Guardiola to have in his arsenal. Savinho darts inside this time, a backpedalling West Ham defence don't fancy it and a he slots a lovely little pass through to Haaland. He gets ahead of Mavropanos - welcome to the game - and creates an angle to dink home. 53 mins: First West Ham chance as Mavropanos comes on for Todibo. You'd assume the Frenchman is injured but after a brief chat with Lopetegui he takes his place on the bench. 51 mins: Haaland has room to stretch his legs on the break. He can't find Savinho though. 50 mins: Nice centre-forward play from Fullkrug to bring it down in the City box. Kudus finds Coufal and Ortega claws away what might have been a mis-hit cross from under his crossbar. 49 mins: Savinho there, who's enjoying dribbling at Coufal so much he actually ran out of pitch. Here we go again. No changes for either side, which means Fullkrug has clearly had some magic spray and is ambling on. Like at Leicester last weekend, this unchanged Manchester City side were not particularly good just then and were terrifyingly easy to play through. Like at Leicester last weekend, Erling Haaland has headed Manchester City into a 2-0 lead. Perhaps Pep Guardiola is onto something. 45+1 mins: Into the only added minutes and West Ham will be relieved it isn't any more as Wan-Bissaka just gets to Gvardiol's cross ahead of Haaland and there's no one there to capitalise for City. 43 mins: GOOOOOAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLL!!!!! Erling Haaland!!!! A classic centre-forward's goal from Haaland, who starts the move with a smart lay-off to Foden. The England man switches play out to Savinho, who has poor old Coufal for breakfast, lunch and dinner before hanging a cross up to the back post for the big Norwegian to head home his 15th Premier League goal of the season. Savinho's silky skill and pinpoint cross to Haaland leads to Man City's second. ð¥ðº Peacock | #MCIWHU pic.twitter.com/7LMPtrVJFl 42 mins: Paqueta tries a pass for Kudus that was almost impossible to pull off given the space he had to work with and it runs out for a goalkick. Lopetegui has some thoughts 38 mins: Excellent save from Areola! Lewis unleashes an absolute rip-snorter from outside the box and the West Ham keeper pushes it out of the top corner. That was travelling. The Hammers deal with he corner but they might have an issue with Fullkrug, who has been moving in laboured fashion since jumping for a header a few moments ago. 35 mins: Savinho has put in another bright showing and an excellent cross forces Wan-Bissaka to clear behind. Foden's delivery is a good one but Gvardiol can't contort himself to get the header on goal. 34 mins: Good spell for the hosts there, but of course there's a West Ham break. Foden sticks with Kudus this time, though and the former Ajax star shanks his shot. 33 mins: Really should be 2-0 to City! Foden plays Lewis into the box, he bears down on Areola before his cutback is too far ahead of Haaland. 32 mins: Should be 2-0 to City! Haaland makes a nuisance of himself and finds Silva, who should score but it's on his weaker foot and he shoots at Areola's legs. 31 mins: Fullkrug gets up to meet Coufal's cross but is crowded out. 30 mins: Gvardiol with a lung-bursting dribble. It's City's best route into West Ham territory because their passing has been insipid. Case in point, the attack loses momentum and Savinho's attempt is gathered by Areola. 29 mins: Fullkrug with a knockdown into the middle of the City area. Like with Wan-Bissaka's cutback earlier there's no one there. Now Paqueta shoots wide. 28 mins: Kovacic blunders into the back of Summerville. That was the only way he was likely to stop him and he's burned through his booking. 24 mins: Kudus again, his shot deflects up and spins into Ortega's arms. How are Manchester City winning this game? They've been awful! 23 mins: Paqueta tries a ridiculous backheel outside his own box. Handily for him. Foden's backheel is also rubbish. West Ham break and do so again nicely until no one is there for a Wan-Bissaka cruback that's screaming to be converted. 22 mins: Oh, now then. Summerville bundles Akanji off the ball and is through on ball before the referee calls play back for a foul on the Swiss defender. Akjanji is pretty lucky there. 17 mins: Gvardiol drives City forward. Coufal's block goes behind for a corner, which is a marked improvement on his last one. In-swinger comes out to Foden via Kovacic, who swivels nicely to volley into a forest of legs. 14 mins: Guardiola anguished as West Ham saunter through the middle of his team again. Kovacic scampers back to pick Kudus' pocket. If the holding midfielder didn't keep getting caught ahead of the play then such evasive action wouldn't be so necessary. 13 mins: West Ham now struggling to get out after a couple of nifty City short corners. Foden, De Bruyne, Savinho and Silva all enjoying themselves before the latter is penalised for a foul. 10 mins: GOOOOOAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLL!!!!!! Vladimir Coufal (OG)!!!! West Ham rue their wastefulness as City go in front with a huge slice of fortune. Credit to Savinho for his persistence after Wan-Bissaka headed his initial cross away. The Brazil winger retrieved possession via a pass from Silva and drilled his next cross, which deflected off Coufal and left Areola with no chance. Savinho's cross deflects in for an own goal as Man City strike first against West Ham. ððº USA Network | #MCIWHU pic.twitter.com/Ngwc6vRu92 9 mins: Kudus in down the City left again. He cuts back for Soucek, whose finish is as bad as the home team's defending. 7 mins: Horrible mistake from Akanji, who hesitates instead of making a simple interception on halfway. Summerville is there ahead of Ake and here's Kudus. He shoots wastefully into the side netting. 5 mins: Foden gets around Alvarez but the cross with his weaker right foot is tame and straight to Areola. 4 mins: That now standard move against this Manchester City. Wan-Bissaka cracks a pass out to the wing for Kudus to chase into the wide-open space. The cross is snuffed out but that's where the threat will be for West Ham down the right and with Summerville over on this near side. 2 mins: Lewis has started in central midfield when City have the ball. Foden looks to slot him into the West Ham box with a cute reverse pass but there's a bit too much on it. De Bruyne gets us underway, Ortega booms one into midfield and City have a free-kick on halfway. 4 mins before kickoff: There's just been a lovely tribute to former City goalkeeper Joe Corrigan, who made 603 appearances for the club. Corrigan was awarded an MBE in the New Year's Honours list. The teams are out there now and we're almost ready to go. 20 mins before kickoff: The teams are warming up, which is easier said than done in Manchester today. It's freezing. Erling Haaland has just spent an extended stint in the middle of a Manchester City rondo. Safe to say it's not the big man's natural habitat. Now he's onto shooting practice and has popped his first effort past veteran backup goalkeeper Scott Carson. 40 mins before kickoff: Losing to Liverpool this season can happen to anyone, but what made last weekend's thrashing such a blow for West Ham is it brought an encouraging run of eight points from four unbeaten games to a shuddering halt. City are not the formidable threat they once were, but if Guardiola's men get on top early here it could turn into another long winter outing for Julen Lopetegui's side. 1 hr 5 mins before kickoff: This is how the West Ham team looks. Crysensio Summerville comes in on the wing to replace injured captain Jarrod Bowen and it looks like Aaron Wan-Bissaka will fill in at left-back with Emerson missing from the matchday squad. Starting 2025 like this ð pic.twitter.com/z7SojQ32oW 1 hr 15 mins before kickoff: The teams are in and Manchester City are unchanged. This is surprising because Guardiola doesn't often do that and the performance at Leicester was nothing to write home about. So James McAtee remains on the bench alongside Jack Grealish and club captain Kyle Walker. Matheus Nunes is fit again and in the matchday squad for the first time since his errors cost City a Manchester derby victory in the middle of last month. Your first City XI of 2025 ð©µXI | Ortega Moreno, Lewis, Akanji, Ake, Gvardiol, Kovacic, De Bruyne (C), Bernardo, Savinho, Foden, HaalandSUBS | Carson, Walker, Grealish, Doku, Gundogan, Nunes, Simpson-Pusey, O'Reilly, McAtee#ManCity | @etihad pic.twitter.com/lxOUCTmSLw 1 hr 40 mins before kickoff: When these sides last met on this ground, City claimed a 3-1 victory to wrap up a fourth consecutive Premier League title. The men behind the victory and what's happened to them since feels instructive when it comes to assessing the champions' overall malaise. Phil Foden scored a screamer inside the first minute and soon doubled City's lead, while Rodri wrapped up the points after halftime. Foden has struggled badly for form and fitness this season and scored more Premier League goals in that West Ham game than he has managed over the course of this term so far, while Rodri is sidelined for the long-term due to ACL surgery. 2 hours before kickoff: Hello and welcome to The Sporting News' live coverage of Manchester City vs. West Ham. Usually at this stage of the season, City would be lumbering up for their long march to the finish line, but things look very different this time around. After complete collapse in form over the past couple of months, Pep Guardiola's side lie sixth. How will they adjust to this new reality and adjusted priorities in 2025? The Premier League match kicks off in Manchester, UK at 3 p.m. local time. Here's how that time translates across some of the major territories: Nathan Ake was substituted with 20 minutes remaining at Leicester on his second game back from a hamstring injury. Guardiola has previously conceded City are carefully monitoring the Dutchman's fitness and fatigue levels but he is ready to helm an injury-hit defence once more with Ruben Dias and John Stones still sidelined. James McAtee produced a standout cameo at the King Power Stadium, living up to the clamour from City fans for him to be granted more minutes. Guardiola also offered fulsome praise afterwards, but he's on the bench once again alongside Jack Grealish and Kyle Walker as the home XI is unchanged. Matheus Nunes is back from a two-week lay-off and among the substitutes.

                "content": "Barcelona (/ËbÉËrsÉËloÊnÉ/ â BAR-sÉ-LOH-nÉ; Catalan: [bÉÉ¾sÉËlonÉ] â; Spanish: [baÉ¾Î¸eËlona] â) is a city on the northeastern coast of Spain. It is the capital and largest city of the autonomous community of Catalonia, as well as the second-most populous municipality of Spain. With a population of 1.6 million within city limits,[8] its urban area extends to numerous neighbouring municipalities within the province of Barcelona and is home to around 5.3 million people,[3] making it the fifth most populous urban area of the European Union after Paris, the Ruhr area, Madrid and Milan.[3] It is one of the largest metropolises on the Mediterranean Sea, located on the coast between the mouths of the rivers Llobregat and BesÃ²s, bounded to the west by the Serra de Collserola mountain range. According to tradition, Barcelona was founded by either the Phoenicians or the Carthaginians, who had trading posts along the Catalonian coast.[9] In the Middle Ages, Barcelona became the capital of the County of Barcelona. After joining with the Kingdom of Aragon to form the confederation of the Crown of Aragon, Barcelona, which continued to be the capital of the Principality of Catalonia, became the most important city in the Crown of Aragon and the main economic and administrative centre of the Crown, only to be overtaken by Valencia, wrested from Moorish control by the Catalans, shortly before the dynastic union between the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon in 1492. Barcelona became the centre of Catalan separatism, briefly becoming part of France during the 17th century Reapers' War and again in 1812 until 1814 under Napoleon. It was the capital of Revolutionary Catalonia during the Spanish Revolution of 1936, and the seat of government of the Second Spanish Republic later in the Spanish Civil War, until its capture by the fascists in 1939. After the Spanish transition to democracy in the 1970s, Barcelona once again became the capital of an autonomous Catalonia. Barcelona has a rich cultural heritage and is today an important cultural centre and a major tourist destination. Particularly renowned are the architectural works of Antoni GaudÃ­ and LluÃ­s DomÃ¨nech i Montaner, which have been designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The city is home to two of the most prestigious universities in Spain: the University of Barcelona and Pompeu Fabra University. The headquarters of the Union for the Mediterranean are located in Barcelona. The city is known for hosting the 1992 Summer Olympics as well as world-class conferences and expositions. In addition, many international sport tournaments have been played here. Barcelona is a major cultural, economic, and financial centre in southwestern Europe,[10] as well as the main biotech hub in Spain.[11] As a leading world city, Barcelona's influence in global socio-economic affairs qualifies it for global city status (Beta +).[12] Barcelona is a transport hub, with the Port of Barcelona being one of Europe's principal seaports and busiest European passenger port,[13] an international airport, BarcelonaâEl Prat Airport, which handles over 50-million passengers per year,[14] an extensive motorway network, and a high-speed rail line with a link to France and the rest of Europe.[15] The name Barcelona comes from the ancient Iberian BaÅkeno, attested in an ancient coin inscription found on the right side of the coin in Iberian script as ,[16] in Ancient Greek sources as ÎÎ±ÏÎºÎ¹Î½ÏÎ½, Barkiná¹n;[17][18] and in Latin as Barcino,[19] Barcilonum[20] and Barcenona.[21][22][23] Other sources suggest that the city may have been named after the Carthaginian general Hamilcar Barca, who was supposed to have founded the city in the 3rd century BC,[9][24] but there is no evidence its name in antiquity, Barcino, was connected with the Barcid family of Hamilcar.[25] During the Middle Ages, the city was variously known as Barchinona, BarÃ§alona, Barchelonaa, and Barchenona. An abbreviated form sometimes used by locals for the city is Barna. BarÃ§a is only applied to the local football club FC Barcelona, not to the city. Another common abbreviation is 'BCN', which is also the IATA airport code of the Barcelona-El Prat Airport. The city is referred to as the Ciutat Comtal in Catalan and Ciudad Condal in Spanish (i.e., \"Comital City\" or \"City of Counts\"), owing to its past as the seat of the Count of Barcelona.[26] The origin of the earliest settlement at the site of present-day Barcelona is unclear. The ruins of an early settlement have been found, including different tombs and dwellings dating to earlier than 5000 BC.[27][28] In Greek mythology, the founding of Barcelona had been attributed to the mythological Hercules. According to tradition, Barcelona was founded by Punic (Phoenician) settlers, who had trading posts along the Catalonian coast.[9][29][30] In particular, some historians attribute the foundation of the city directly to the historical Carthaginian general, Hamilcar Barca, father of Hannibal, who supposedly named the city Barcino after his family in the 3rd century BC,[9][31] but this theory has been questioned.[25] Archeological evidence in the form of coins from the 3rd century BC have been found on the hills at the foot of MontjuÃ¯c with the name BÃ¡rkeno written in an ancient script in the Iberian language[citation needed]. Thus, we can conclude[clarification needed] that the Laietani[citation needed], an ancient Iberian (pre-Roman) people of the Iberian peninsula, who inhabited the area occupied by the city of Barcelona around 3â2 BC[clarification needed], called the area BÃ rkeno, which means \"The Place of the Plains\" (Barrke = plains/terrace).[32][better source needed] In about 15 BC, the Romans redrew the town as a castrum (Roman military camp) centred on the \"Mons Taber\", a little hill near the Generalitat (Catalan Government) and city hall buildings. The Roman Forum, at the crossing of the Cardo Maximus and Decumanus Maximus, was approximately placed where current PlaÃ§a de Sant Jaume is. Thus, the political centre of the city, Catalonia, and its domains has remained in the same place for over 2,000 years. Under the Romans, it was a colony with the surname of Faventia,[33] or, in full, Colonia Faventia Julia Augusta Pia Barcino[34] or Colonia Julia Augusta Faventia Paterna Barcino. Pomponius Mela[35] mentions it among the small towns of the district, probably as it was eclipsed by its neighbour Tarraco (modern Tarragona), but it may be gathered from later writers that it gradually grew in wealth and consequence, favoured as it was with a beautiful situation and an excellent harbour.[36] It enjoyed immunity from imperial burdens.[37] The city minted its own coins; some from the era of Galba survive. Important Roman vestiges are displayed in PlaÃ§a del Rei underground, as a part of the Barcelona City History Museum (MUHBA); the typically Roman grid plan is still visible today in the layout of the historical centre, the Barri GÃ²tic (Gothic Quarter). Some remaining fragments of the Roman walls have been incorporated into the cathedral.[38] The cathedral, Catedral BasÃ­lica Metropolitana de Barcelona, is also sometimes called La Seu, which simply means cathedral (and see, among other things) in Catalan.[39][40] It is said to have been founded in 343. The city was conquered by the Visigoths in the early 5th century, becoming for a few years the capital of all Hispania. After being conquered by the Umayyads in the early 8th century, it was conquered after a siege in 801 by Charlemagne's son Louis, who made Barcelona the seat of the Carolingian \"Hispanic March\" (Marca Hispanica), a buffer zone ruled by the Count of Barcelona.[41] The Counts of Barcelona became increasingly independent and expanded their territory to include much of modern Catalonia, although in 985, Barcelona was sacked by the army of Almanzor.[42] The sack was so traumatic that most of Barcelona's population was either killed or enslaved.[43] In 1137, Aragon and the County of Barcelona merged in dynastic union[44][45] by the marriage of Ramon Berenguer IV and Petronilla of Aragon, their titles finally borne by only one person when their son Alfonso II of Aragon ascended to the throne in 1162. His territories were later to be known as the Crown of Aragon, which conquered many overseas possessions and ruled the western Mediterranean Sea with outlying territories in Naples and Sicily and as far as Athens in the 13th century. Barcelona was the leading slave trade centre of the Crown of Aragon up until the 15th century, when it was eclipsed by Valencia.[46] It initially fed from eastern and Balkan slave stock later drawing from a Maghribian and, ultimately, Subsaharan pool of slaves.[47] The Bank or Taula de canvi de Barcelona, often viewed as the oldest public bank in Europe, was established by the city magistrates in 1401. It originated from necessities of the state, as did the Bank of Venice (1402) and the Bank of Genoa (1407).[48] In the beginning of the Early Modern period, Barcelona lost political primacy, but the economy managed to achieve a balance between production capacity and imports.[49] In the context of the wider early recovery of Catalonia from the 17th-century crisis in the second half of the century, increasing maritime activity since 1675 doubled traffic in the port of Barcelona compared to figures from the beginning of the 17th century.[50] In the late 17th and early 18th century, Barcelona repeatedly endured the effects of war, including the 1691 bombing, the sieges of 1697, 1704, 1705, 1706, and the 1713 blockade and ensuing 1714 siege and assault.[51] In the 18th century, the population grew from 30,000 to about 100,000 inhabitants, as the city became one of the key mercantile centres in the Western Mediterranean, with inland influence up to Zaragoza, and to the south up to Alicante.[52] A fortress was built at MontjuÃ¯c that overlooked the harbour. Much of Barcelona was negatively affected by the Napoleonic wars, but the start of industrialization saw the fortunes of the province improve. In the mid-1850s, Barcelona was struggling with population density as it became an industrial, port city and European capital. The city's density was at 856 people per hectare, more than double that of Paris. Mortality rates were on the rise and any outbreaks of disease would devastate the population. To solve the issue, a civil engineer named Ildefons CerdÃ  proposed a plan for a new district known as the Eixample. The citizens of Barcelona had begun to demolish the medieval wall surrounding and constricting the city. CerdÃ  thought it best to transform the land outside the walls into an area characterized by a scientific approach to urbanization. His proposal consisted of a grid of streets to unite the old city and surrounding villages. There would also be wide streets to allow people to breathe clean air, gardens in the centre of each street block, integration of rich and poor giving both groups access to the same services, and smooth-flowing traffic. Urban quality, egalitarianism, hygiene, sunlight, and efficiency were all major keys for CerdÃ 's vision. Not everything he imagined would be realized within the Eixample district, but the iconic octagonal superblocks with chamfered corners for better visibility are his direct brainchild and remain immensely helpful even 170 years later. The district and its ideals were not appreciated at the time. The city council awarded the design of the extension plan to another architect. The Spanish government was the one to step in and impose CerdÃ 's plan, laying the groundwork for many more tensions between the Spanish and Catalan administrations. Regardless, some of the upper class citizens of Barcelona were excited by the new plan and began a race to build \"the biggest, tallest, most attractive house\" in the district. Their interest and money fueled the rich diversity that we now see in the district's architecture. In the end, CerdÃ 's ideas would have a lasting impact on Barcelona's development, earning it international recognition for its highly efficient approach to urban planning and design.[53][54] During the Spanish Civil War, the city, and Catalonia in general, were resolutely Republican. Many enterprises and public services were collectivized by the CNT and UGT unions. As the power of the Republican government and the Generalitat diminished, much of the city was under the effective control of anarchist groups. The anarchists lost control of the city to their own allies, the Communists and official government troops, after the street fighting of the Barcelona May Days. The fall of the city on 26 January 1939, caused a mass exodus of civilians who fled to the French border. The resistance of Barcelona to Franco's coup d'Ã©tat was to have lasting effects after the defeat of the Republican government. The autonomous institutions of Catalonia were abolished,[57] and the use of the Catalan language in public life was suppressed. Barcelona remained the second largest city in Spain, at the heart of a region which was relatively industrialized and prosperous, despite the devastation of the civil war. The result was a large-scale immigration from poorer regions of Spain (particularly Andalusia, Murcia and Galicia), which in turn led to rapid urbanization. In 1992, Barcelona hosted the Summer Olympics. The after-effects of this are credited with driving major changes in what had, up until then, been a largely industrial city. As part of the preparation for the games, industrial buildings along the sea-front were demolished and 3 km (2 mi) of beach were created. New construction increased the road capacity of the city by 17%, the sewage handling capacity by 27% and the amount of new green areas and beaches by 78%. Between 1990 and 2004, the number of hotel rooms in the city doubled. Perhaps more importantly, the outside perception of the city was changed making, by 2012, Barcelona the 12th most popular city destination in the world and the 5th amongst European cities.[58][59][60][61][62] The death of Franco in 1975 brought on a period of democratization throughout Spain. Pressure for change was particularly strong in Barcelona, which considered that it had been punished during nearly forty years of Francoism for its support of the Republican government.[63] Massive, but peaceful, demonstrations on 11 September 1977 assembled over a million people in the streets of Barcelona to call for the restoration of Catalan autonomy. It was granted less than a month later.[64] The development of Barcelona was promoted by two events in 1986: Spanish accession to the European Community, and particularly Barcelona's designation as host city of the 1992 Summer Olympics.[65][66] The process of urban regeneration has been rapid, and accompanied by a greatly increased international reputation of the city as a tourist destination. The increased cost of housing has led to a slight decline (â16.6%) in the population over the last two decades of the 20th century as many families move out into the suburbs. This decline has been reversed since 2001, as a new wave of immigration (particularly from Latin America and from Morocco) has gathered pace.[67] In 1987, an ETA car bombing at Hipercor killed 21 people. On 17 August 2017, a van was driven into pedestrians on La Rambla, killing 14 and injuring at least 100, one of whom later died. Other attacks took place elsewhere in Catalonia. The Prime Minister of Spain, Mariano Rajoy, called the attack in Barcelona a jihadist attack. Amaq News Agency attributed indirect responsibility for the attack to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).[68][69][70] During the 2010s, Barcelona became the focus city[citation needed] for the ongoing Catalan independence movement, its consequent standoff between the regional and national government and later protests.[71] In July 2023, Barcelona was announced as the UNESCO-UIA World Capital of Architecture for the 2024â2026 term. This means it will be the hub for discussion around global challenges including culture, heritage, urban planning and architecture. In addition to being the capital through 2026, it will also host the UIA World Congress of Architects for that year. The honour is befitting of Barcelona, as its history is peppered with architectural achievement and various iconic styles and influences. From its ancient Roman roots, to the Gothic and Modernisme movements, Barcelona has thrived through the way it ties together architecture and culture.[72] Barcelona is located on the northeast coast of the Iberian Peninsula, facing the Mediterranean Sea, on a plain approximately 5 km (3 mi) wide limited by the mountain range of Collserola, the Llobregat river to the southwest and the BesÃ²s river to the north.[73] This plain covers an area of 170 km2 (66 sq mi),[73] of which 101 km2 (39.0 sq mi)[74] are occupied by the city itself. It is 120 km (75 mi) south of the Pyrenees and the Catalan border with France. Tibidabo, 512 m (1,680 ft) high, offers striking views over the city[75] and is topped by the 288.4 m (946.2 ft) Torre de Collserola, a telecommunications tower that is visible from most of the city. Barcelona is peppered with small hills, most of them urbanized, that gave their name to the neighbourhoods built upon them, such as Carmel (267 m or 876 ft), Putxet (es) (181 m or 594 ft) and Rovira (261 m or 856 ft). The escarpment of MontjuÃ¯c (173 m or 568 ft), situated to the southeast, overlooks the harbour and is topped by MontjuÃ¯c Castle, a fortress built in the 17â18th centuries to control the city as a replacement for the Ciutadella. Today, the fortress is a museum and MontjuÃ¯c is home to several sporting and cultural venues, as well as Barcelona's biggest park and gardens. The city borders on the municipalities of Santa Coloma de Gramenet and Sant AdriÃ  de BesÃ²s to the north; the Mediterranean Sea to the east; El Prat de Llobregat and L'Hospitalet de Llobregat to the south; and Sant Feliu de Llobregat, Sant Just Desvern, Esplugues de Llobregat, Sant Cugat del VallÃ¨s, and Montcada i Reixac to the west. The municipality includes two small sparsely-inhabited exclaves to the north-west. According to the KÃ¶ppen climate classification, Barcelona has a hot summer Mediterranean climate (Csa), with mild winters and warm to hot summers,[76] while the rainiest seasons are autumn and spring. The rainfall pattern is characterized by a short (3 months) dry season in summer, as well as less winter rainfall than in a typical Mediterranean climate. However, both June and August are wetter than February, which is unusual for the Mediterranean climate. This subtype, labelled as \"Portuguese\" by the French geographer George Viers after the climate classification of Emmanuel de Martonne[77] and found in the NW Mediterranean area (e.g. Marseille), can be seen as transitional to the humid subtropical climate (Cfa) found in inland areas. Barcelona is densely populated, thus heavily influenced by the urban heat island effect. Areas outside of the urbanized districts can have as much as 2 Â°C of difference in temperatures throughout the year.[78] Its average annual temperature is 21.2 Â°C (70.2 Â°F) during the day and 15.1 Â°C (59.2 Â°F) at night. The average annual temperature of the sea is about 20 Â°C (68 Â°F). In the coldest month, January, the temperature typically ranges from 12 to 18 Â°C (54 to 64 Â°F) during the day, 6 to 12 Â°C (43 to 54 Â°F) at night and the average sea temperature is 13 Â°C (55 Â°F).[79] In the warmest month, August, the typical temperature ranges from 27 to 31 Â°C (81 to 88 Â°F) during the day, about 23 Â°C (73 Â°F) at night and the average sea temperature is 26 Â°C (79 Â°F).[79] Generally, the summer or \"holiday\" season lasts about six months, from May to October. Two months â April and November â are transitional; sometimes the temperature exceeds 20 Â°C (68 Â°F), with an average temperature of 18â19 Â°C (64â66 Â°F) during the day and 11â13 Â°C (52â55 Â°F) at night. December, January and February are the coldest months, with average temperatures around 15 Â°C (59 Â°F) during the day and 9 Â°C (48 Â°F) at night. Large fluctuations in temperature are rare, particularly in the summer months. Because of the proximity to the warm sea plus the urban heat island, frosts are very rare in the city of Barcelona. Snow is also very infrequent in the city of Barcelona, but light snowfalls can occur yearly in the nearby Collserola mountains, such as in the Fabra Observatory located in a nearby mountain.[80] Barcelona averages 78 rainy days per year (â¥ 1 mm), and annual average relative humidity is 72%, ranging from 69% in July to 75% in October. Rainfall totals are highest in late summer and autumn (SeptemberâNovember) and lowest in early and mid-summer (JuneâAugust), with a secondary winter minimum (FebruaryâMarch). Sunshine duration is 2,524 hours per year, from 138 (average 4.5 hours of sunshine a day) in December to 310 (average 10 hours of sunshine a day) in July.[81] According to Barcelona's City Council, the city's population as of 1 January 2016[update] was 1,608,746 people,[86] on a land area of 101.4 km2 (39 sq mi). It is the main component of an administrative area of Greater Barcelona, with a population of 3,218,071 in an area of 636 km2 (246 sq mi) (density 5,060 inhabitants/km2). The population of the urban area was 4,840,000.[3] It is the central nucleus of the Barcelona metropolitan area, which relies on a population of 5,474,482.[4] In 1900, Barcelona had a population of 533,000,[73] which grew steadily but slowly until 1950, when it started absorbing a high number of people from other less-industrialized parts of Spain. Barcelona's population peaked in 1979 at 1,906,998, and fell throughout the 1980s and 1990s as more people sought a higher quality of life in outlying cities in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area. After bottoming out in 2000 with 1,496,266 residents, the city's population began to rise again as younger people started to return, causing a great increase in housing prices.[87] Spanish is the most spoken language in Barcelona (according to the linguistic census held by the Government of Catalonia in 2013) and it is understood almost universally. Catalan is also very commonly spoken in the city: it is understood by 95% of the population, while 72.3% can speak it, 79% can read it, and 53% can write it.[88] Knowledge of Catalan has increased significantly in recent decades thanks to a language immersion educational system. After Catalan and Spanish, the most spoken languages in Barcelona are those from North Africa, such as Amazigh and Arabic, followed by Bengali, Urdu, Panjabi, Mandarin Chinese, Romanian, English, Russian and Quechua, according to data collected by the University of Barcelona.[89] Barcelona is one of the most densely populated cities in Europe. For the year 2008 the city council calculated the population to 1,621,090 living in the 102.2 km2 sized municipality, giving the city an average population density of 15,926 inhabitants per square kilometre with Eixample being the most populated district.[90][full citation needed] In the case of Barcelona though, the land distribution is extremely uneven. Half of the municipality or 50.2 km2, all of it located on the municipal edge is made up of the ten least densely populated neighbourhoods containing less than 10% of the city's population, the uninhabited Zona Franca industrial area and MontjuÃ¯c forest park. Leaving the remaining 90% or slightly below 1.5 million inhabitants living on the remaining 52 km2 (20 sq mi) at an average density close to 28,500 inhabitants per square kilometre.[90][full citation needed] Of the 73 neighbourhoods in the city, 45 had a population density above 20,000 inhabitants per square kilometre with a combined population of 1,313,424 inhabitants living on 38.6 km2 at an average density of 33,987 inhabitants per square kilometre. The 30 most densely populated neighbourhoods accounted for 57.5% of the city population occupying only 22.7% of the municipality, or in other words, 936,406 people living at an average density of 40,322 inhabitants per square kilometre. The city's highest density is found at and around the neighbourhood of la Sagrada FamÃ­lia where four of the city's most densely populated neighbourhoods are located side by side, all with a population density above 50,000 inhabitants per square kilometre.[90][full citation needed] In 1900, almost a third (28.9 percent) of the population were children (aged younger than 14 years). In 2017, this age group constituted only 12.7% of the population. In 2017, people aged between 15 and 24 years made up 9 percent of the population; those aged between 25 and 44 years made up 30.6 percent of the population; while those aged between 45 and 64 years formed 56.9% of all Barcelonans. In 1900, people aged 65 and older made up just 6.5 percent of the population. In 2017, this age group made up 21.5 percent of the population.[91][92] In 2016, about 59% of the inhabitants of the city were born in Catalonia and 18.5% coming from the rest of the country. In addition to that, 22.5% of the population was born outside of Spain, a proportion which has more than doubled since 2001 and more than quintupled since 1996 when it was 8.6% and 3.9% respectively.[86] The most important region of origin of migrants is Europe, with many coming from Italy (26,676) or France (13,506).[86] Moreover, many migrants come from Latin American nations such as Bolivia, Ecuador or Colombia. Since the 1990s, and similar to other migrants, many Latin Americans have settled in northern parts of the city.[94] There exists a relatively large Pakistani community in Barcelona with up to twenty thousand nationals. The community consists of significantly more men than women. Many of the Pakistanis are living in Ciutat Vella. First Pakistani migrants came in the 1970s, with increasing numbers in the 1990s.[95] Other significant migrant groups come from Asia as from China and the Philippines.[86] There is a Japanese community clustered in Bonanova, Les Tres Torres, Pedralbes, and other northern neighbourhoods, and a Japanese international school serves that community.[96] In 2007, most of the inhabitants stated they are Roman Catholic (208 churches).[97] In a 2011 survey conducted by InfoCatÃ³lica, 49.5% of Barcelona residents of all ages identified themselves as Catholic.[98] This was the first time that more than half of respondents did not identify themselves as Catholic Christians.[98] The numbers reflect a broader trend in Spain whereby the numbers of self-identified Catholics have declined.[98] In 2019, a survey by Centro de Investigaciones SociolÃ³gicas showed that 53.2% of residents in Barcelona identified themselves as Catholic (9.9% practising Catholics, 43.3% non-practising Catholics).[99] The province has the largest Muslim community in Spain, 322,698 people in Barcelona province are of Muslim religion.[100] A considerable number of Muslims live in Barcelona due to immigration (169 locations, mostly professed by Moroccans in Spain).[97] In 2014, 322,698 out of 5.5 million people in the province of Barcelona identified themselves as Muslim,[100] which makes 5.6% of the total population. The city also has the largest Jewish community in Spain, with an estimated 3,500 Jews living in the city.[101] There are also a number of other groups, including Evangelical (71 locations, mostly professed by Roma), Jehovah's Witnesses (21 Kingdom Halls), Buddhists (13 locations),[102] and Eastern Orthodox.[103] The Barcelona metropolitan area comprises over 66% of the people of Catalonia, one of the richer regions in Europe and the fourth richest region per capita in Spain, with a GDP per capita amounting to â¬28,400 (16% more than the EU average). The greater Barcelona metropolitan area had a GDP amounting to $177 billion (equivalent to $34,821 in per capita terms, 44% more than the EU average), making it the 4th most economically powerful city by gross GDP in the European Union, and 35th in the world in 2009.[104] Barcelona city had a very high GDP of â¬80,894 per head in 2004, according to Eurostat.[105] Furthermore, Barcelona was Europe's fourth best business city and fastest improving European city, with growth improved by 17% per year as of 2009[update].[106] Barcelona was the 24th most \"livable city\" in the world in 2015 according to lifestyle magazine Monocle.[107] Similarly, according to Innovation Analysts 2thinknow, Barcelona occupies 13th place in the world on Innovation Citiesâ¢ Global Index.[108] At the same time it is according to the Global Wealth and Lifestyle Report 2020 one of the most affordable cities in the world for a luxury lifestyle.[109] Barcelona has a long-standing mercantile tradition. Less well known is that the city industrialized early, taking off in 1833, when Catalonia's already sophisticated textile industry began to use steam power. It became the first and most important industrial city in the Mediterranean basin. Since then, manufacturing has played a large role in its history. Borsa de Barcelona (Barcelona Stock Exchange) is the main stock exchange in the northeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula. Barcelona was recognized as the Southern European City of the Future for 2014/15, based on its economic potential,[110] by FDi Magazine in their bi-annual rankings.[111] It also has several congress halls, notably Fira de Barcelona â the second largest trade fair and exhibition centre in Europe, that host a quickly growing number of national and international events each year (at present above 50). The total exhibition floor space of Fira de Barcelona venues is 405,000 m2 (41 ha), not counting Gran Via centre on the Plaza de Europa. However, the Eurozone crisis and deep cuts in business travel affected the council's positioning of the city as a convention centre. An important business centre, the World Trade Center Barcelona, is located in Barcelona's Port Vell harbour. The city is known for hosting well as world-class conferences and expositions, including the 1888 ExposiciÃ³n Universal de Barcelona, the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition (Expo 1929), the 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures and the 2004 World Urban Forum.[112] Barcelona was the 20th-most-visited city in the world by international visitors and the fifth most visited city in Europe after London, Paris, Istanbul and Rome, with 5.5 million international visitors in 2011.[113] By 2015, both Prague and Milan had more international visitors.[114] With its popular tree-lined pedestrian street, Les Rambles (Las Ramblas), Barcelona is ranked the most popular city to visit in Spain.[115] Barcelona is an internationally renowned tourist destination, with numerous recreational areas, one of the best beaches in the world,[116][117] mild and warm climate, historical monuments, including eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites, 519 hotels as of March 2016[update][118] including 35 five-star hotels,[119] and developed tourist infrastructure. Due to its large influx of tourists each year, Barcelona, like many other tourism capitals, has to deal with pickpockets, with wallets and passports being commonly stolen items. Despite its moderate pickpocket rate, Barcelona is considered one of the safest cities in terms of security and personal safety,[120] mainly because of a sophisticated policing strategy that has dropped crime by 32% in just over three years and has led it to be considered the 15th safest city in the world by Business Insider in 2016.[121] While tourism produces economic benefits, according to one report,[citation needed] the city is \"overrun [by] hordes of tourists\". In early 2017, over 150,000 protesters warned that tourism is destabilizing the city. Slogans included \"Tourists go home\", \"Barcelona is not for sale\" and \"We will not be driven out\". By then, the number of visitors had increased from 1.7 million in 1990 to 32 million in a city with a population of 1.62 million, increasing the cost of rental housing for residents and overcrowding the public places. While tourists spent an estimated â¬30 billion in 2017, they are viewed by some as a threat to Barcelona's identity.[122] A May 2017 article in the British online daily The Independent included Barcelona among the \"Eight Places That Hate Tourists the Most\" and included a comment from Mayor Ada Colau, \"We don't want the city to become a cheap souvenir shop\", citing Venice as an example.[123] To moderate the problem, the city has stopped issuing licenses for new hotels and holiday apartments; it also fined AirBnb â¬30,000. The mayor has suggested introducing a new tourist tax and setting a limit on the number of visitors.[123] One industry insider, Justin Francis, founder of the Responsible Travel agency, stated that steps must be taken to limit the number of visitors that are causing an \"overtourism crisis\" in several major European cities. \"Ultimately, residents must be prioritised over tourists for housing, infrastructure and access to services because they have a long-term stake in the city's success\", he said.[124] \"Managing tourism more responsibly can help\", Francis later told a journalist, \"but some destinations may just have too many tourists, and Barcelona may be a case of that\".[125] Industry generates 21% of the total gross domestic product (GDP) of the region,[126] with the energy, chemical and metallurgy industries accounting for 47% of industrial production.[127] The Barcelona metropolitan area had 67% of the total number of industrial establishments in Catalonia as of 1997.[128] Barcelona has long been an important European automobile manufacturing centre. Formerly there were automobile factories of AFA, Abadal, Actividades Industriales, Alvarez, America, ArtÃ©s de Arcos, BalandrÃ¡s, Baradat-Esteve, BiscÃºter, J. Castro, ClÃºa, David, DelfÃ­n, DÃ­az y GrillÃ³, Ebro trucks, Edis [ca], Elizalde, AutomÃ³viles EspaÃ±a, Eucort, Fenix, FÃ¡brica Hispano, Auto Academia Garriga, FÃ¡brica EspaÃ±ola de AutomÃ³viles Hebe, Hispano-Suiza, HuracÃ¡n Motors, Talleres Hereter, Junior SL, Kapi, La Cuadra, M.A., AutomÃ³viles Matas, Motores y Motos, Nacional Custals, National Pescara, Nacional RG, Nacional Rubi, Nacional Sitjes, AutomÃ³viles Nike, Orix, Otro Ford, Patria, Pegaso, PTV, Ricart, Ricart-EspaÃ±a, Industrias Salvador, Siata EspaÃ±ola, Stevenson, Romagosa y CompaÃ±Ã­a, Garaje Storm, Talleres Hereter, Trimak, AutomÃ³viles Victoria, Manufacturas MecÃ¡nicas Aleu.[129][130] Today, the headquarters and a large factory of SEAT (the largest Spanish automobile manufacturer) are in one of its suburbs. There is also a Nissan factory in the logistics and industrial area of the city.[131] The factory of Derbi, a large manufacturer of motorcycles, scooters and mopeds, also lies near the city.[132] As in other modern cities, the manufacturing sector has long since been overtaken by the services sector, though it remains very important. The region's leading industries are textiles, chemical, pharmaceutical, motor, electronic, printing, logistics, publishing, in telecommunications industry and culture the notable Mobile World Congress, and information technology services. The traditional importance of textiles is reflected in Barcelona's drive to become a major fashion centre. There have been many attempts to launch Barcelona as a fashion capital, notably Gaudi Home.[citation needed] Beginning in the summer of 2000, the city hosted the Bread & Butter urban fashion fair until 2009, when its organizers announced that it would be returning to Berlin. This was a hard blow for the city as the fair brought â¬100 m to the city in just three days.[133][134] From 2009, The Brandery, an urban fashion show, was held in Barcelona twice a year until 2012. According to the Global Language Monitor's annual ranking of the world's top fifty fashion capitals Barcelona was named as the seventh most important fashion capital of the world right after Milan and before Berlin in 2015.[135] As the capital of the autonomous community of Catalonia, Barcelona is the seat of the Catalan government, known as the Generalitat de Catalunya; of particular note are the executive branch, the parliament, and the High Court of Justice of Catalonia. The city is also the capital of the Province of Barcelona and the BarcelonÃ¨s comarca (district). Barcelona is governed by a city council formed by 41 city councillors, elected for a four-year term by universal suffrage. As one of the two biggest cities in Spain, Barcelona is subject to a special law articulated through the Carta Municipal (Municipal Law). A first version of this law was passed in 1960 and amended later, but the current version was approved in March 2006.[136] According to this law, Barcelona's city council is organized in two levels: a political one, with elected city councillors, and one executive, which administers the programs and executes the decisions taken on the political level.[137] This law also gives the local government a special relationship with the central government and it also gives the mayor wider prerogatives by the means of municipal executive commissions.[138] It expands the powers of the city council in areas like telecommunications, city traffic, road safety and public safety. It also gives a special economic regime to the city's treasury and it gives the council a veto in matters that will be decided by the central government, but that will need a favourable report from the council.[136] The ComissiÃ³ de Govern (Government Commission) is the executive branch, formed by 24 councillors, led by the Mayor, with 5 lieutenant-mayors and 17 city councillors, each in charge of an area of government, and 5 non-elected councillors.[139] The plenary, formed by the 41 city councillors, has advisory, planning, regulatory, and fiscal executive functions.[140] The six Commissions del Consell Municipal (City council commissions) have executive and controlling functions in the field of their jurisdiction. They are composed by a number of councillors proportional to the number of councillors each political party has in the plenary.[141] The city council has jurisdiction in the fields of city planning, transportation, municipal taxes, public highways security through the GuÃ rdia Urbana (the municipal police), city maintenance, gardens, parks and environment, facilities (like schools, nurseries, sports centres, libraries, and so on), culture, sports, youth and social welfare. Some of these competencies are not exclusive, but shared with the Generalitat de Catalunya or the central Spanish government. In some fields with shared responsibility (such as public health, education or social services), there is a shared Agency or Consortium between the city and the Generalitat to plan and manage services.[142] The executive branch is led by a Chief Municipal Executive Officer which answers to the Mayor. It is made up of departments which are legally part of the city council and by separate legal entities of two types: autonomous public departments and public enterprises.[143] The seat of the city council is on the PlaÃ§a de Sant Jaume, opposite the seat of Generalitat de Catalunya. Since the coming of the Spanish democracy, Barcelona had been governed by the PSC, first with an absolute majority and later in coalition with ERC and ICV. After the May 2007 election, the ERC did not renew the coalition agreement and the PSC governed in a minority coalition with ICV as the junior partner. After 32 years, on 22 May 2011, CiU gained a plurality of seats at the municipal election, gaining 15 seats to the PSC's 11. The PP hold 8 seats, ICV 5 and ERC 2. Since 1987, the city has been divided into 10 administrative districts (districtes in Catalan, distritos in Spanish): The districts are based mostly on historical divisions, and several are former towns annexed by the city of Barcelona in the 18th and 19th centuries that still maintain their own distinct character. Each district has its own council led by a city councillor. The composition of each district council depends on the number of votes each political party had in that district, so a district can be led by a councillor from a different party than the executive council. Barcelona has a well-developed higher education system of public universities. Most prominent among these are the University of Barcelona (established in 1450) and the more modern Pompeu Fabra University.[144][145] Barcelona is also home to the Polytechnic University of Catalonia, and in the private sector the EADA Business School (founded in 1957), which became the first Barcelona institution to run manager training programmes for the business community. IESE Business School, as well as the largest private educational institution, the Ramon Llull University, which encompasses schools and institutes such as the ESADE Business School. The Autonomous University of Barcelona, another public university, is located in Bellaterra, a town in the Metropolitan Area. Toulouse Business School and the Open University of Catalonia (a private Internet-centred open university) are also based in Barcelona. The city has a network of public schools, from nurseries to high schools, under the responsibility of a consortium led by city council (though the curriculum is the responsibility of the Generalitat de Catalunya). There are also many private schools, some of them Roman Catholic. Most such schools receive a public subsidy on a per-student basis, are subject to inspection by the public authorities, and are required to follow the same curricular guidelines as public schools, though they charge tuition. Known as escoles concertades, they are distinct from schools whose funding is entirely private (escoles privades). The language of instruction at public schools and escoles concertades is Catalan, as stipulated by the 2009 Catalan Education Act. Spanish may be used as a language of instruction by teachers of Spanish literature or language, and foreign languages by teachers of those languages. An experimental partial immersion programme adopted by some schools allows for the teaching of a foreign language (English, generally) across the curriculum, though this is limited to a maximum of 30% of the school day. No public school or escola concertada in Barcelona may offer 50% or full immersion programmes in a foreign language, nor does any public school or escola concertada offer International Baccalaureate programmes. Barcelona's cultural roots go back 2000 years. Since the arrival of democracy, the Catalan language (very much repressed during the dictatorship of Franco) has been promoted, both by recovering works from the past and by stimulating the creation of new works. Barcelona is designated as a world-class city by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network.[146] It has also been part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a City of Literature since 2015.[147] Barcelona has many venues for live music and theatre, including the world-renowned Gran Teatre del Liceu opera house, the Teatre Nacional de Catalunya, the Teatre Lliure and the Palau de la MÃºsica Catalana concert hall. Barcelona also is home to the Barcelona Symphony and Catalonia National Orchestra (Orquestra SimfÃ²nica de Barcelona i Nacional de Catalunya, usually known as OBC), the largest symphonic orchestra in Catalonia. In 1999, the OBC inaugurated its new venue in the brand-new Auditorium (L'Auditori). It performs around 75 concerts per season and its current director is Eiji Oue.[148] It is home to the Barcelona Guitar Orchestra, directed by Sergi Vicente. The major thoroughfare of La Rambla is home to mime artists and street performers. Yearly, two major pop music festivals take place in the city, the SÃ³nar Festival and the Primavera Sound Festival. The city also has a thriving alternative music scene, with groups such as The Pinker Tones receiving international attention.[149] Barcelona is an international hub of highly active and diverse nightlife with bars, dance bars and nightclubs staying open well past midnight.[150] El PeriÃ³dico de Catalunya, La Vanguardia and Ara are Barcelona's three major daily newspapers (the first two with Catalan and Spanish editions, Ara only in Catalan) while Sport and El Mundo Deportivo (both in Spanish) are the city's two major sports daily newspapers, published by the same companies. The city is also served by a number of smaller publications such as Ara and El Punt Avui (in Catalan), by nationwide newspapers with special Barcelona editions such as El PaÃ­s (in Spanish, with an online version in Catalan) and El Mundo (in Spanish), and by several free newspapers like 20 minutos and QuÃ¨ (all bilingual). Barcelona's oldest and main online newspaper VilaWeb is also the oldest one in Europe[citation needed] (with Catalan and English editions). Several major FM stations include Catalunya RÃ dio, RAC 1, RAC 105 and Cadena SER. Barcelona also has a local TV station, BetevÃ©, owned by city council. The headquarters of TelevisiÃ³ de Catalunya, Catalonia's public network, are located in Sant Joan DespÃ­, in Barcelona's metropolitan area. Barcelona has a long sporting tradition and hosted the highly successful 1992 Summer Olympics as well as several matches during the 1982 FIFA World Cup (at the two stadiums). It has hosted about 30 sports events of international significance.[citation needed] FC Barcelona is a sports club best known worldwide for its football team, one of the largest and the wealthiest in the world.[151] It has 74 national trophies (while finishing 46 times as runners-up) and 17 continental prizes (with being runners-up 11 times), including five UEFA Champions League trophies out of eight finals and three FIFA Club World Cup wins out of four finals. The club won six trophies in a calendar year in 2009, becoming one of only 2 male football teams in the world to win the coveted sextuple, apart from FC Bayern Munich in 2020. FC Barcelona also has professional teams in other sports like FC Barcelona Regal (basketball), FC Barcelona Handbol (handball), FC Barcelona Hoquei (roller hockey), FC Barcelona Ice Hockey (ice hockey), FC Barcelona Futsal (futsal) and FC Barcelona Rugby (rugby union), all at one point winners of the highest national or European competitions. The club's museum is the second most visited in Catalonia. The matches against cross-town rivals RCD Espanyol are of particular interest, but there are other Barcelonan football clubs in lower categories, like CE Europa and UE Sant Andreu. FC Barcelona's basketball team has a noted rivalry in the Liga ACB with nearby Joventut Badalona. Barcelona has three UEFA elite stadiums: FC Barcelona's Camp Nou, the largest stadium in Europe with a capacity of 99,354; the publicly owned Estadi OlÃ­mpic LluÃ­s Companys, with a capacity of 55,926; used for the 1992 Olympics; and Estadi CornellÃ -El Prat, with a capacity of 40,500. Furthermore, the city has several smaller stadiums such as Mini Estadi (also owned by FC Barcelona) with a capacity of 15,000, Camp Municipal NarcÃ­s Sala with a capacity of 6,563 and Nou Sardenya with a capacity of 7,000. The city has a further three multifunctional venues for sports and concerts: the Palau Sant Jordi with a capacity of 12,000 to 24,000 (depending on use), the Palau Blaugrana with a capacity of 7,500, and the Palau dels Esports de Barcelona with a capacity of 3,500. Barcelona was the host city for the 2013 World Aquatics Championships, which were held at the Palau San Jordi.[152] Several road running competitions are organized year-round in Barcelona: the Barcelona Marathon every March with over 10,000 participants in 2010, the Cursa de Bombers in April, the Cursa de El Corte InglÃ©s in May (with about 60,000 participants each year), the Cursa de la MercÃ¨, the Cursa Jean Bouin, the Milla Sagrada FamÃ­lia and the San Silvestre. There is also the Ultratrail Collserola which passes 85 km (53 mi) through the Collserola forest. The Open Seat GodÃ³, a 50-year-old ATP World Tour 500 Series tennis tournament, is held annually in the facilities of the Real Club de Tenis Barcelona. Each year on Christmas Day, a 200-meter swimming race across the Old Port of Barcelona takes place.[153] Near Barcelona, in MontmelÃ³, the 107,000 capacity Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya racetrack hosts the Formula One Spanish Grand Prix, the Catalan motorcycle Grand Prix, the Spanish GT Championship and races in the GP2 Series. Skateboarding and cycling are also very popular in Barcelona; in and around the city there are dozens of kilometers of bicycle paths.[citation needed] Barcelona is also home to numerous social centres and illegal squats that effectively form a shadow society mainly made up of the unemployed, immigrants, dropouts, anarchists, anti-authoritarians and autonomists.[154] Peter Gelderloos estimates that there around 200 squatted buildings and 40 social centres across the city with thousands of inhabitants, making it one of the largest squatter movements in the world. He notes that they pirate electricity, internet and water allowing them to live on less than one euro a day. He argues that these squats embrace an anarcho-communist and anti-work philosophy, often freely fixing up new houses, cleaning, patching roofs, installing windows, toilets, showers, lights and kitchens. In the wake of austerity, the squats have provided a number of social services to the surrounding residents, including bicycle repair workshops, carpentry workshops, self-defense classes, free libraries, community gardens, free meals, computer labs, language classes, theatre groups, free medical care and legal support services.[155] The squats help elderly residents avoid eviction and organize various protests throughout Barcelona. Notable squats include Can Vies and Can Masdeu.[citation needed] Barcelona is served by Barcelona-El Prat Airport, about 17 km (11 mi) south-west of the centre of Barcelona. It is the second-largest airport in Spain, and the largest on the Mediterranean coast, which handled more than 50.17 million passengers in 2018, showing an annual upward trend.[156] It is a main hub for Vueling Airlines and Ryanair, and also a focus for Iberia and Air Europa. The airport mainly serves domestic and European destinations, although some airlines offer destinations in Latin America, Asia and the United States. The airport is connected to the city by highway, metro (Airport T1 and Airport T2 stations), commuter train (Barcelona Airport railway station) and scheduled bus service. A new terminal (T1) has been built, and entered service on 17 June 2009. Some low-cost airlines, also use Girona-Costa Brava Airport, about 90 km (56 mi) to the north, Reus Airport, 77 km (48 mi) to the south, or Lleida-Alguaire Airport, about 150 km (93 mi) to the west, of the city. Sabadell Airport is a smaller airport in the nearby town of Sabadell, devoted to pilot training, aerotaxi and private flights. The Port of Barcelona has a 2000-year-old history and a great contemporary commercial importance. It is Europe's ninth largest container port, with a trade volume of 1.72 million TEU's in 2013.[157] The port is managed by the Port Authority of Barcelona. Its 10 km2 (4 sq mi) are divided into three zones: Port Vell (the old port), the commercial port and the logistics port (Barcelona Free Port). The port is undergoing an enlargement that will double its size thanks to diverting the mouth of the Llobregat river 2 km (1 mi) to the south.[158] The Barcelona harbour is the leading European cruiser port and a very important Mediterranean turnaround base.[159] In 2013, 3.6 million pleasure cruise passengers used the Port of Barcelona.[157] The Port Vell area also houses the Maremagnum (a commercial mall), a multiplex cinema, the IMAX Port Vell and one of Europe's largest aquariums â Aquarium Barcelona, containing 8,000 fish and 11 sharks contained in 22 basins filled with 4 million litres of sea water. The Maremagnum, being situated within the confines of the port, is the only commercial mall in the city that can open on Sundays and public holidays. Barcelona is a major hub for the Spanish rail network. The city's main Inter-city rail station is Barcelona Sants railway station, whilst EstaciÃ³ de FranÃ§a terminus serves a secondary role handling suburban, regional and medium distance services. Freight services operate to local industries and to the Port of Barcelona. RENFE's AVE high-speed rail system, which is designed for speeds of 310 km/h (193 mph), was extended from Madrid to Barcelona in 2008 in the form of the MadridâBarcelona high-speed rail line. A shared RENFE-SNCF high-speed rail connecting Barcelona and France (Paris, Marseilles and Toulouse, through PerpignanâBarcelona high-speed rail line) was launched in 2013. Both these lines serve Barcelona Sants terminal station.[160][161] Barcelona is served by an extensive local public transport network that includes a metro system, a bus network, a regional railway system, trams, funiculars, rack railways, a Gondola lift and aerial cable cars. These networks and lines are run by a number of different operators but they are integrated into a coordinated fare system, administered by the Autoritat del Transport MetropolitÃ  (ATM). The system is divided into fare zones (1 to 6) and various Integrated Travel Cards are available.[162] The Barcelona Metro network comprises twelve lines, identified by an \"L\" followed by the line number as well as by individual colours. The Metro largely runs underground; eight Metro lines are operated on dedicated track by the Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB), whilst four lines are operated by the Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya (FGC) and some of them share tracks with RENFE commuter lines. In addition to the city Metro, several regional rail lines operated by RENFE's Rodalies de Catalunya run across the city, providing connections to outlying towns in the surrounding region. The city's two modern tram systems, Trambaix and TrambesÃ²s, are operated by TRAMMET.[163] A heritage tram line, the Tramvia Blau, also operates between the metro Line 7 and the Funicular del Tibidabo.[164] Barcelona's metro and rail system is supplemented by several aerial cable cars, funiculars and rack railways that provide connections to mountain-top stations. FGC operates the Funicular de Tibidabo up the hill of Tibidabo and the Funicular de Vallvidrera (FGC), while TMB runs the Funicular de MontjuÃ¯c up MontjuÃ¯c. The city has two aerial cable cars: the MontjuÃ¯c Cable Car, which serves MontjuÃ¯c castle, and the Port Vell Aerial Tramway that runs via Torre Jaume I and Torre Sant SebastiÃ  over the port. Buses in Barcelona are a major form of public transport, with extensive local, interurban and night bus networks. Most local services are operated by the TMB, although some other services are operated by a number of private companies, albeit still within the ATM fare structure. There are 21 night lines, 19 of them go through PlaÃ§a de Catalunya, where you can change to other lines. The frequency is 15/20 minutes between 22:20 and 06:00. A separate private bus line, known as AerobÃºs, links the airport with the city centre, with its own fare structure. The EstaciÃ³ del Nord (Northern Station), a former railway station which was renovated for the 1992 Olympic Games, now serves as the terminus for long-distance and regional bus services. Barcelona has a metered taxi fleet governed by the Institut MetropolitÃ  del Taxi (Metropolitan Taxi Institute), composed of more than 10,000 cars. Most of the licences are in the hands of self-employed drivers. With their black and yellow livery, Barcelona's taxis are easily spotted, and can be caught from one of many taxi ranks, hailed on street, called by telephone or via app.[165][166] On 22 March 2007,[167] Barcelona's City Council started the Bicing service, a bicycle service understood as a public transport. Once the user has their user card, they can take a bicycle from any of the more than 400 stations spread around the city and use it anywhere the urban area of the city, and then leave it at another station.[168] The service has been a success, with 50,000 subscribed users in three months.[169] Barcelona lies on three international routes, including European route E15 that follows the Mediterranean coast, European route E90 to Madrid and Lisbon, and European route E09 to Paris. It is also served by a comprehensive network of motorways and highways throughout the metropolitan area, including A-2, A-7/AP-7, C-16, C-17, C-31, C-32, C-33, C-60. The city is circled by three half ring roads or bypasses, Ronda de Dalt (B-20) (on the mountain side), Ronda del Litoral (B-10) (along the coast) and Ronda del Mig (separated into two parts: Travessera de Dalt in the north and the Gran Via de Carles III), two partially covered[170] fast highways with several exits that bypass the city. The city's main arteries include Diagonal Avenue, which crosses it diagonally, Meridiana Avenue which leads to GlÃ²ries and connects with Diagonal Avenue and Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, which crosses the city from east to west, passing through its centre. The famous boulevard of La Rambla, whilst no longer an important vehicular route, remains an important pedestrian route. The Barri GÃ²tic (Catalan for \"Gothic Quarter\") is the centre of the old city of Barcelona. Many of the buildings date from medieval times, some from as far back as the Roman settlement of Barcelona. Catalan modernista architecture (related to the movement known as Art Nouveau in the rest of Europe) developed between 1885 and 1950 and left an important legacy in Barcelona. Several of these buildings are World Heritage Sites. Especially remarkable is the work of architect Antoni GaudÃ­, which can be seen throughout the city. His best-known work is the immense but still unfinished church of the Sagrada FamÃ­lia, which has been under construction since 1882 and is still financed by private donations. As of 2015[update], completion is planned for 2026.[171] Barcelona was also home to Mies van der Rohe's Barcelona Pavilion. Designed in 1929 for the International Exposition for Germany, it was an iconic building that came to symbolize modern architecture as the embodiment of van der Rohe's aphorisms \"less is more\" and \"God is in the details\".[172] The Barcelona pavilion was intended as a temporary structure and was torn down in 1930 less than a year after it was constructed. A modern re-creation by Spanish architects now stands in Barcelona, however, constructed in 1986. Barcelona won the 1999 RIBA Royal Gold Medal for its architecture,[173] the first (and as of 2015[update], only) time that the winner has been a city rather than an individual architect. Barcelona is the home of many points of interest declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO:[174] Barcelona has a great number of museums, which cover different areas and eras. The National Museum of Art of Catalonia possesses a well-known collection of Romanesque art, while the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art focuses on post-1945 Catalan and Spanish art. The FundaciÃ³ Joan MirÃ³, Picasso Museum, and FundaciÃ³ Antoni TÃ pies hold important collections of these world-renowned artists, as well as the Can Framis Museum, focused on post-1960 Catalan Art owned by FundaciÃ³ Vila Casas. Several museums cover the fields of history and archaeology, like the Barcelona City History Museum (MUHBA), the Museum of the History of Catalonia, the Archeology Museum of Catalonia, the Maritime Museum of Barcelona, the Music Museum of Barcelona and the privately owned Egyptian Museum. The Erotic museum of Barcelona is among the most peculiar ones, while CosmoCaixa is a science museum that received the European Museum of the Year Award in 2006.[175] The Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona was founded in 1882 under the name of \"Museo Martorell de ArqueologÃ­a y Ciencias Naturales\"[176][177] (Spanish for \"Martorell Museum of Archaeology and Natural Sciences\"). In 2011 the Museum of Natural Sciences ended up with a merge of five institutions: the Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona (the main site, at the Forum Building), the Martorell Museum (the historical seat of the Museum, opened to the public from 1924 to 2010 as a geology museum), the Laboratori de Natura, at the Castle of the Three Dragons (from 1920 to 2010: the Zoology Museum), the Historical Botanical Garden of Barcelona, founded 1930, and the Botanical garden of Barcelona, founded 1999. Those two gardens are a part of the Botanical Institute of Barcelona too. The FC Barcelona Museum is the third most popular tourist attraction in Catalonia, with 1,51 million visitors in 2013.[178] Barcelona contains sixty municipal parks, twelve of which are historic, five of which are thematic (botanical), forty-five of which are urban, and six of which are forest.[179] They range from vest-pocket parks to large recreation areas. The urban parks alone cover 10% of the city (549.7 ha or 1,358.3 acres).[74] The total park surface grows about 10 ha (25 acres) per year,[180] with a proportion of 18.1 m2 (195 sq ft) of park area per inhabitant.[181] Of Barcelona's parks, MontjuÃ¯c is the largest, with 203 ha located on the mountain of the same name, and includes the Botanical Garden of Barcelona, the MossÃ¨n Costa i Llobera Gardens, and more.[74] It is followed by Parc de la Ciutadella (which occupies the site of the old citadel and which houses the Parliament building, the Barcelona Zoo, and several museums); 31 ha or 76.6 acres including the zoo), the GuinardÃ³ Park (19 ha or 47.0 acres), Park GÃ¼ell (designed by Antoni GaudÃ­; 17.2 ha or 42.5 acres), Oreneta Castle Park (also 17.2 ha or 42.5 acres), Diagonal Mar Park (13.3 ha or 32.9 acres, inaugurated in 2002), Nou Barris Central Park (13.2 ha or 32.6 acres), Can DragÃ³ Sports Park and Poblenou Park (both 11.9 ha or 29.4 acres), the Labyrinth Park (9.10 ha or 22.5 acres), named after the garden maze it contains.[74] There are also several smaller parks, for example, the Parc de Les AigÃ¼es (2 ha or 4.9 acres). A part of the Collserola Park is also within the city limits. PortAventura World, one of the largest resort in Europe, with 5,837,509 visitors per year, is located one hour's drive from Barcelona.[182][183] Also, within the city lies Tibidabo Amusement Park, a smaller amusement park in Plaza del Tibidabo, with the Muntanya Russa amusement ride. Barcelona beach was listed as number one in a list of the top ten city beaches in the world according to National Geographic[116] and Discovery Channel.[184] Barcelona contains seven beaches, totalling 4.5 km (2+3â4 mi) of coastline. Sant SebastiÃ , Barceloneta and Somorrostro beaches, both 1,100 m (3,610 ft) in length,[74] are the largest, oldest and the most-frequented beaches in Barcelona. The Olympic Harbour separates them from the other city beaches: Nova IcÃ ria, Bogatell, Mar Bella, Nova Mar Bella and Llevant. These beaches (ranging from 400 to 640 m (1,310 to 2,100 ft) were opened as a result of the city restructuring to host the 1992 Summer Olympics, when a great number of industrial buildings were demolished. At present, the beach sand is artificially replenished given that storms regularly remove large quantities of material. The 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures left the city a large concrete bathing zone on the eastmost part of the city's coastline. Most recently, Llevant is the first beach to allow dogs access during summer season. Barcelona is twinned with:[185] Barcelona also cooperates with:[185]",

                "title": "Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball program is the men's college basketball team of the University of Kentucky. It has eight NCAA championships, the best all-time winning percentage, and the most all-time victories.[2] The Wildcats compete in the Southeastern Conference and are coached by Mark Pope.[3] Adolph Rupp first brought Kentucky to national prominence, winning four NCAA titles. Since then, Joe B. Hall, Rick Pitino, Tubby Smith, and John Calipari each won a national championship, making Kentucky the only school with five coaches to win NCAA championships and placing it second only to UCLA for most titles. Kentucky has finished as the NCAA runner-up four times, making it tied with UCLA and North Carolina for all-time title game appearances at 12. The program has played in 17 NCAA Final Fours, tying Duke for third-all time behind North Carolina and UCLA. Kentucky leads all schools in several NCAA tournament stats: Elite Eight appearances at 38, Sweet Sixteen appearances at 45, total NCAA tournament appearances at 60, and tournament games played at 184. The program is behind only North Carolina with 131 NCAA tournament wins, North Carolina has 132. Kentucky has also won the National Invitation Tournament twice, making it the only school to win multiple NCAA and NIT championships, and it leads all schools in total postseason appearances at 68. Additionally, the Helms Athletic Foundation declared Kentucky the 1933 and 1954 national champions, the latter being Kentucky's only undefeated team in the modern era (post-1930). The 1948 NCAA champion team, coached by Rupp, represented the United States in the Olympics and won a gold medal. Kentucky was the first program to 1000 wins in 1968 and the first to 2000 wins in 2009. The program leads all schools with sixty-three 20-win seasons, sixteen 30-win seasons, and six 35-win seasons. Additionally, Kentucky is second among all teams in conference regular season championships with 53. Throughout its history, the Kentucky basketball program has featured many notable and successful players, both on the collegiate level and the professional level. Five players have been named national player of the year, with Anthony Davis in 2012 and Oscar Tshiebwe in 2022 being consensus selections. Three players have been named national freshman of the year: John Wall in 2010, Davis in 2012, and Reed Sheppard in 2024. Thirty-nine players have been selected as All-Americans a total of 51 times. Kentucky holds the record for the most overall NBA Draft selections (128) and three Wildcats have been selected as the first overall pick (Wall, Davis, and Karl-Anthony Towns). Thirty-nine players have been honored with jersey retirements, as well as Rupp, Hall, Pitino, Smith, equipment manager Bill Keightly, and broadcaster Cawood Ledford. Seven players have been enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame, as well as Rupp, Pitino, Calipari, Eddie Sutton, and Ledford. During Kentucky's earliest seasons the program went through multiple coaches, with the majority staying only one or two seasons. Records indicate that the first head coach of the Wildcats was W. W. H. Mustaine, who in 1903 called together some students, took up a collection totaling $3 for a ball, and told the students to start playing.[4] The first recorded intercollegiate game at the college was a 15â6 defeat to nearby Georgetown College. The team went 1â2 for their first \"season\", also losing to Kentucky University (later Transylvania University) but defeating the Lexington YMCA.[5] Through 1908, the team did not manage a winning season, and had an all-time record of 15â29. In the fall of that year a full-time head coach was hired, Edwin Sweetland. This made him the first paid coach in Kentucky's basketball history.[6] That year, the team went 5â4, and only three years later, boasted their first undefeated season with nine victories and no losses.[7] The 1914 team under Alpha Brummage, led by brothers Karl and Tom Zerfoss, went 12â2 and defeated all its Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association opponents. In 1919, George Buchheit became the new head coach of the Wildcats. An alumnus of the University of Illinois, he brought with him a new system of basketball. The \"Buchheit system\" or \"Illinois system\", focused on defense and featured one player standing under each basket, while three roamed the court. Bucheit varied the system he learned in Illinois in one important way. While the Illinois system employed a zone defense, Buchheit's system used an aggressive man-to-man scheme. On offense, he used a complicated system of passing called the \"zig-zag\" or \"figure eight\" offense.[8] Although the team had a losing season in Buchheit's first year, they won the first-ever Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association tournament the next year, defeating the heavily favored Georgia Bulldogs. Both of these teams were composed entirely of native Kentuckians, anchored by All-American Basil Hayden. The tournament victory was considered Kentucky's first major success, and the 1921 team became known as the \"Wonder Team.\"[9] In 1922, the team was unable to build on the success of the \"Wonder Team.\" Although every player was eligible in 1922, two key players, Hayden and Sam Ridgeway, were injured before the start of the season. Hayden returned from his knee injury during the season, but was never able to play at the level he had the previous year. Ridgeway fought a year-long battle with diphtheria, and although he recovered, never played for the Wildcats again. The remaining three members of the \"Wonder Team\" went 9â5 for the season, and bowed out of the SIAA tournament in the second round.[10] Buchheit remained as coach through the 1924 season before moving on to coach Trinity College (later Duke University). A different coach would guide the team for each of the next four years. C.O. Applegran immediately followed Buchheit, and his 1925 team posted a respectable 13â8 record. Applegran in college had played for the University of Illinois, where he became an All-American. The next year, Ray Eklund led the team to a 15â3 record, and produced UK's second All-American, Burgess Carey.[11] The record was enough for Kentucky to win their first regular season conference championship in the Southern Conference. Seeing the cupboard largely bare for the upcoming year, Eklund resigned shortly before the start of the 1927 season. The team scrambled to find a new coach, and former player Basil Hayden left his coaching job at Kentucky Wesleyan College to answer the call. An inexperienced coach and a roster largely depleted of talent left the Wildcats with a 3â13 record that year. The disappointment convinced Hayden that he wasn't the \"coaching type\", and he resigned after the season. Fortunately for the Wildcats, 1927 would be their last losing season for six decades.[12] The Wildcats' new coach for the 1927â28 season was John Mauer. Although he had a talented group of players moving up from the junior varsity team, Mauer quickly discovered that his players did not know the fundamentals of the game. He began a regimen of three-hour practices five days a week during the preseason. The practice began with half an hour of shooting drills and usually ended with a full-court scrimmage. Between the two, Mauer worked on skill drills and scenarios. Mauer's teams were nicknamed the \"Mauermen.\"[13] Teamwork was the hallmark of Mauer's system. Every player worked on every aspect of the game; there were no specialists. Like Buchheit, Mauer employed a strong man-to-man defense. He utilized a slow-break offense that relied on a complicated system of short passes to get a good shot. Two elements of Mauer's system were new to basketball in the south â the offensive screen and the bounce pass. The latter was so new to most of UK's opponents that it was referred to as the \"submarine attack.\"[14] Over his three-year tenure, Mauer led the Wildcats to an overall record of 40â14. One major prize eluded him, however. Despite having teams that were almost universally acknowledged as the \"class of the South\", Mauer never led a team to the Southern Conference title. Despite his innate ability for coaching, Mauer lacked the ability to heighten his team's emotions for a big game, a fault that was cited as the reason for his lack of tournament success. Mauer left the Wildcats to coach the Miami University Redskins following the 1930 season.[15] In 1930, the university hired Adolph Rupp, who had played as a reserve for the University of Kansas 1922 and 1923 Helms National Championship teams,[16] under coach Forest C. \"Phog\" Allen. At the time of his hiring, Rupp was a high school coach in Freeport, Illinois.[4] Rupp coached the University of Kentucky men's basketball team from 1930 to 1972. There, he gained the nicknames, \"Baron of the Bluegrass\", and \"The Man in the Brown Suit\". Rupp, who was an early innovator of the fast break and set offense, gained a reputation as an intense competitor, a strict motivator, and strategist. Rupp's Wildcat teams won 4 NCAA championships (1948, 1949, 1951, 1958), one NIT title in 1946, appeared in 20 NCAA tournaments, had 6 NCAA Final Four appearances, captured 27 Southeastern Conference (SEC) regular season titles, and won 13 SEC tournaments. Rupp's Kentucky teams also finished ranked No. 1 on 6 occasions in the final Associated Press college basketball poll and 4 times in the United Press International (Coaches) poll. In addition, Rupp's 1966 Kentucky squad (nicknamed \"Rupp's Runts\", as no starting player on the squad was taller than 6'5\") finished runner-up in the NCAA tournament, and his 1947 Wildcats finished runner-up in the NIT. Rupp's 1933 and 1954 Kentucky squads were also awarded the Helms National Championship, and his 1934 and 1947 teams were retroactively recognized as the national champion by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.[17][18][19][20] Rupp gave the '44 team the nickname \"the Beardless Wonders\" and \"Wildkittens\" because according to Rupp, \"It was like running a Kindergarten\".[citation needed] Of the young players, Kentucky's best player was freshman Chad Anderson who, at the age of 17, was named consensus All-American, making him the youngest player to ever earn the title. The Beardless Wonders won 19 of their 21 games, enough to be invited into the NIT. There they were matched up with a Utah team nicknamed the \"Blitz Kids\".[citation needed] Both teams went into the half tied at 24, but with the help of Brannum Kentucky pulled away to win 46â38. Kentucky lost the next game to home town Saint John's.[citation needed] On the way to its first NCAA title, Kentucky went on to a record of 36â3. Of these three losses, all were either away or at neutral sites, keeping Kentucky undefeated at home throughout the entire season. Kentucky started off the beginning of the season with a 7â0 record heading into their away game at Temple. However, Temple was able to give the Cats their first loss by one point, 60â59. But the Wildcats rolled off an 11-win streak before playing at Notre Dame, where they lost 55â64. They did not lose a game for the rest of the regular season. Kentucky continued through the NCAA tournament to the finals, where they faced the Baylor Bears. Kentucky won its first NCAA title in a decisive 58â42 victory. The season did not end after the NCAA tournament, as Kentucky who would play in the Olympic Trials, where they went 2â1, only losing to the Phillips Oilers once. This was performance enough to represent the United States in the 1948 Olympic Games. Despite only being a college team, the starting 5 of Kentucky defeated all of its competition in London, making Kentucky the only team to win both an NCAA title and an Olympic gold medal.[citation needed] Adolph Rupp soon gave this team the nickname \"The Fabulous Five\", in honor of their accomplishments.[citation needed][21] For the 1949 season Kentucky had high expectations with most of the Fabulous Five returning. Big Blue Nation's expectations were met as the 1949 team won one more game than the previous year including both a SEC regular season and SEC tournament championship, while also getting back to the Final Four that March. In the finals Kentucky faced the Oklahoma A&M Cowboys, a team that had previously seen success in the tournament with back-to-back championships in 1945 and 1946. The Fab Five would succeed again winning 46â36 and Kentucky's only back-to-back NCAA championship. Kentucky was the second program in NCAA history to win back-to-back championships (there have been six other schools since). With a returning star player like Bill Spivey, Kentucky hoped to carry their success into the new decade. The Wildcats lost their first game by 11 to Saint John's at home, but they would pull it together for the Sugar Bowl Tournament, which they won, beating NCAA runner-up Bradley. After losing to Tennessee, Kentucky struggled to chain two wins together, losing every other game. They defeated their next 14 opponents, including getting revenge in SEC tournament championship over Tennessee. Heading into the post-season, No. 3 Kentucky played CCNY in the NIT, missing the NCAA tournament. The Wildcats were no match and were thrashed by the CCNY Beavers, 50â83. Over the season Kentucky defeated four top 10 teams, and were ranked in the top 5 the entire season. Vanderbilt, however, knocked off the top ranked Wildcats in the SEC tournament finals denying them an eighth straight SEC tournament title. Kentucky then defeated fourth ranked Kansas State 68â58 in the NCAA finals, . Adolph Rupp was the head coach at Kentucky during the year of the point-shaving scandal of 1951. In 1945 former Kentucky football player Nick Englisis met Kentucky player Ralph Beard while the two played football at Kentucky. Englisis entered the gambling business when he left the football team in 1946, then approached three Kentucky basketball players Ralph Beard, Alex Groza, and Dale Barnstable with his associates in late 1948 about potentially point shaving (fixing the score of games) during the upcoming season in exchange for money. The three players agreed to point shave and successfully shaved points in several games during the 1948â1949 season until an effort to point shave caused the Wildcats to lose to the Loyola Ramblers in the National Invitation Tournament. Groza, Beard, and Barnstable attempted to win the game under the point spread but kept the score too close, allowing the Ramblers to win the game with an impressive performance at the end of the second half. Kentucky faced Villanova in their first game of the NCAA tournament following the loss to Loyola and the three players attempted to win over the point spread. When Groza, Beard, and Barnstable failed to win over the point spread, it caused Englisis to lose all of his money and ended the point shaving deals between Englisis and these three players.[22] On October 20, 1951, Alex Groza, Ralph Beard, and Dale Barnstable were arrested for taking bribes from gamblers to shave points during several games including the National Invitation Tournament game against the Loyola Ramblers in the 1948â49 season.[23][24] At the conclusion of this scandal, a subsequent NCAA investigation found that Kentucky had committed several rule violations, including giving illegal spending money to players on several occasions, and also allowing some ineligible athletes to compete.[24] As a result, the Southeastern Conference voted to ban Kentucky from competing for a year and the NCAA requested all other basketball-playing members not to schedule Kentucky, with eventually none doing so.[25] As a result of these actions, Kentucky was forced to cancel the entire 1952â53 basketball season. Years later, Walter Byers, the first executive director of the NCAA, unofficially referred to this punishment as the first de facto NCAA death penalty, despite the current rule first coming into effect in 1985, thus the NCAA having no such enforcement power previous to that.[26][27] Echoing Mr. Byers' view, the NCAA's official stance is very much the same, and they now state in hindsight, \"In effect, it was the Association's first death penalty, though its enforcement was binding only through constitutional language that required members to compete against only those schools that were compliant with NCAA rules. Despite fears that it would resist, Kentucky accepts the penalty and, in turn, gives the NCAA credibility to enforce its rules.\" [28] The team posted a perfect 25â0 record in the next year (Rupp's only undefeated season), for which it was awarded the 1954 Helms National Championship. In addition, Kentucky also finished ranked No. 1 in the final Associated Press poll. On the team were three players who had graduated at the conclusion of the previous academic year. When, at the last minute, the NCAA ruled these players ineligible from post-season play, Rupp decided to skip the 1954 NCAA Tournament in protest.[citation needed] The \"Fiddlin' Five\" team earned their name though playing around and mistakes, which Rupp described as fiddling. The Fiddlin' Five still has the most losses out of any Kentucky's championships, with six, three of those were in four games.[citation needed] Unlike the Fab Five or the 1951 teams, the Fiddling Five would yoyo in the rankings with their lowest a No. 13 coming after 56â57 loss to unranked Loyola Chicago. Kentucky improved through the tournament though, and won their fourth title over No. 18 Seattle in the confines of Louisville's Freedom Hall. Rupp's last Final Four team and one of his last chances at a 5th NCAA title occurred in the 1965â66 season, with Kentucky going all the way to the NCAA title game. The 1966 NCAA championship game against Texas Western (now University of Texas-El Paso or UTEP) marked the first occurrence that an all-white starting five (Kentucky) played an all-black starting five (Texas Western) in the NCAA championship game.[citation needed] Texas Western won the game 72â65, on the night of March 19, 1966. Kentucky entered the tournament with only one loss and ranked No. 1, Texas Western also had only one loss and entered the tournament ranked second. Kentucky was a 6.5 point favorite in the game[29] The game was depicted in the film Glory Road.[citation needed] This game, and the result of it, were especially significant as the game came at a time when the civil rights movement was coming into full swing around the country. In 1969, after actively recruiting black players for over six years (his first formal scholarship offer was to Wes Unseld in 1964), despite most of the other SEC teams threatening to boycott if a black player took the court), Rupp finally signed his first black player, Tom Payne, an athletic 7'-1\" center out of Louisville. This ended the aspect of all-white Kentucky teams forever, and marked a new era with many notable black Kentucky basketball legends, including Jack Givens, Sam Bowie, Kenny Walker, Jamal Mashburn, Tayshaun Prince, Rajon Rondo, John Wall, Anthony Davis, and Karl Anthony Towns.[30] The late Rupp years looked promising with Dan Issel's commitment to the Wildcats in 1966. Over the next four years Issel scored an average of 25.7 per game, adding up to 2,137 points in his college career. This made Issel the player with the most points to ever play at Kentucky, a feat that has not been matched to this day. This included his 53 points scored against Mississippi State in 1970, the most by a Kentucky player in a single game until Jodie Meeks made 54 against rival Tennessee on January 13, 2009. Issel did not capture the national championship in his college years, but would go on to make a name for himself in the ABA.[citation needed] After 1966 Rupp saw continued success, but the Final Four eluded him. The Wildcats ended with a 13â13 season and missed the tournament altogether in 1967, then reach the Elite Eight and Sweet Sixteen in the next two years. Ranked #1 in the nation with a 26â1 record overall, Kentucky nearly missed a Final Four berth in a 106â100 shootout against Jacksonville. [citation needed] Rupp was forced into retirement in March 1972, after reaching age 70. At the time, this was the mandatory retirement age for all University of Kentucky employees. He was a 5-time National Coach-of-the-Year award winner, a 7-time Conference Coach-of-the-Year award winner, and was elected a member of both the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and College Basketball Hall of Fame. Further, since 1972, the Adolph Rupp Trophy, considered one of the nation's premier basketball awards, has been given by Commonwealth Athletic Club to the nation's top men's college basketball player. In addition, the University of Kentucky retired a jersey in his honor in the rafters of Rupp Arena, a 23,500-seat arena named after him, dedicated in 1976.[17][18] Joe B. Hall was the head basketball coach at Kentucky from 1972 to 1985. Although he had been an assistant at Kentucky since 1965, Coach Hall was given a difficult task: to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor, Adolph Rupp. In the 1978 NCAA tournament, he coached the Wildcats to their fifth NCAA championship. He was named National Coach of the Year in 1978 and SEC Coach of the Year on four occasions. His record at UK was 297â100, and 373â156 over his career. Coach Hall won the title once in 1978, as well as making the final four in 1975 and 1984, and the elite eight in 1972, 1973, 1977, 1983.[citation needed] Coach Hall is one of only three men to both play on an NCAA championship team (1949â Kentucky) and coach an NCAA championship team (1978â Kentucky), and the only one to do so for the same school.[citation needed] The only others to achieve this feat are: After a year of playing in the freshman league and a disappointing sophomore season, Hall's Super Kittens returned with hopes of finally bringing Kentucky its fifth title. They nearly did just that, guiding Kentucky to a runner-up finish to UCLA in the 1975 NCAA tournament but not before avenging their 20-point defeat to an undefeated Indiana team. Despite losing in the championship game, it would give freshman Jack Givens a taste for success that would help propel Kentucky to the title three years later. It had been 20 years without a championship in Lexington, and along with pressure of following a hall of fame coach, Hall would nickname the 1978 season the \"Season Without Celebration.\" The pressure to win was immense on both players and coach to bring home the title, especially with a senior laden team that had gone to the finals as freshmen. Kentucky would hardly lose its composure all season or break under pressure, winning 30 of 32 games and defeating eight ranked teams along the way. By the time Kentucky reached the tournament finals they seemed bound to win the title, though Duke would give Kentucky their all. With the help of senior Jack \"Goose\" Givens' 41 points, Kentucky defeated the Blue Devils 94â88, and finally won their fifth title and first in 20 years. In 1985, Eddie Sutton succeeded Joe B. Hall. He coached the Wildcats for four years, leading them to the Elite Eight of the 1986 NCAA tournament. Two seasons later, Sutton and the 25â5 Wildcats captured their 37th SEC title and were ranked as the 6th college basketball team in the nation by the Associated Press and UPI[31][32] before losing to Villanova in the Tournament. Kentucky entered the 1988â89 season with a gutted roster. Ed Davender, Robert Lock and Winston Bennett had all graduated from school, while All-SEC sophomore Rex Chapman left school early to enter the 1988 NBA draft. Additionally, sophomore standout Eric Manuel was suspected of cheating on his college entrance exam and voluntarily agreed to sit out until the investigation was finished. Potential franchise recruit Shawn Kemp transferred out of Kentucky after signing with the school early that year.[33] Unfortunately, Manuel was forced to sit out the entire season as the investigation dragged on, essentially leaving the Wildcats in the hands of inexperienced sophomore LeRon Ellis and true freshman Chris Mills. The two underclassmen struggled to fill the talent vacuum on the court and the Wildcats finished with a losing record of 13â19, the team's first losing full-season record since 1927.[32] To add insult to injury, the NCAA announced at the end of the season that its investigation into the basketball program had found the school guilty of violating numerous NCAA policies.[34] The scandal broke when Emery Worldwide employees claimed to have discovered $1,000 in cash in an envelope Kentucky assistant coach Dwane Casey sent to Mills' father.[35] Later Emery settled a libel lawsuit filed by Casey for a substantial amount of money. Casey was not in Lexington when the envelope was supposedly mailed and the father of Mills said they received no money. The NCAA rescinded its show cause order immediately after the settlement of the lawsuit, and Casey's career has flourished as an NBA coach.[36] Another player, Eric Manuel, was alleged to have received improper assistance on his college entrance exams and was banned from NCAA competition. Whether Manuel was directly involved has been questioned.[37] Kentucky was already on probation stemming from allegations of an extensive scheme of payments to recruits, and the NCAA seriously considered hitting the Wildcats with the \"death penalty\", which would have shut down the entire basketball program (as opposed to simply being banned from postseason play) for up to two years. However, school president David Roselle forced Sutton and athletic director Cliff Hagan to resign. The Wildcats were slapped with three years' probation, a two-year ban from postseason play, the vacating of their two NCAA tournament wins in the 1988 season, and a ban from live television in 1989â90.[38][39] In 1989, Rick Pitino left the NBA's New York Knicks and became the coach at a Kentucky program reeling from the aforementioned scandal. Kentucky would be banned from the 1990 and 1991 post season, with the 1990 season suffering a 14â14 record. Kentucky would improve in 1991 with a beavy of home-grown upperclassmen such as Sean Woods, John Pelphrey, Richie Farmer, Deron Feldhaus, and Reggie Hanson along with the talented freshman Jamal Mashburn. Despite their record of 22â6, Kentucky was still banned from the post season and would have to wait another year to see the Unforgettables succeed in the tournament. Beginning with the 1992 season, Kentucky was free of post season bans. Though they lost one more game than last season, this team was most memorable for going to the Elite Eight (for the first time since Sutton's 1986 team) with many returning upperclassmen from Kentucky. The team is also known for playing in what could be considered one of the greatest games in NCAA tournament history against Duke. In this game defending champion Duke were looking to return to the Final Four once again, Kentucky for the first time in almost a decade. The game was hard-fought and physical on both sides all game including Laettner's infamous stomp on Aminu Timberlake, which resulted in a technical. The teams took the lead back and forth until the final minute of the game which resulted in a first buzzer beater shot by Kentucky's Sean Woods to take the lead 103â102, and then Laettner's shot to win the game for the Blue Devils in the final seconds 104â103. This team came to be known as the \"Unforgettables\" for helping put Kentucky back on the path to success in the 1990s and because the team was made up of home grown Kentucky kids. Kentucky returned a junior Mashburn, along with Travis Ford and Tony Delk. They were expected to reach the Final Four for the first time since Joe B. Hall's 1984 team. The expectations were right, as Kentucky would head into the post-season with only 2 losses and a No. 5 ranking. After winning the SEC Tournament once again, Kentucky stormed to the NCAA Final Four to meet up with Michigan's \"Fab Five\" a team of young and highly talented recruits that brought Michigan to the championship game the year before. As talented as Kentucky was they would fail to reach the championship game with a 78â81 overtime loss to the Wolverines. But this would be the just a glimpse of a run Kentucky would have later in the decade. Kentucky started the next season ranked #1 but would underachieve, falling short of the Elite Eight for the only time under Pitino. The highlight of the season was the \"Mardi Gras Miracle\", a game where Kentucky trailed LSU 68â37 with 15:34 left, but outscored them 62â27 over the remainder of regulation to win 99â95.[40] Starting in 1996, Kentucky would put together a string of Final Fours with help from 9 future NBA players. The \"Untouchables\" as they were nicknamed, would only lose twice, to Final Four bound UMass Minutemen (coached by future Kentucky coach John Calipari) and Mississippi State. It was with their overwhelming talent and chemistry that would win Kentucky their sixth national title in the 1996 NCAA tournament, Kentucky's first NCAA championship in 18 years. The following year, Pitino's Kentucky team made it back to the national title game, losing to Arizona in overtime in the finals of the 1997 NCAA tournament. Pitino's fast-paced teams at Kentucky were favorites of the school's fans. It was primarily at Kentucky where he implemented his signature style of full-court pressure defense. By the end of the Pitino era, Kentucky went from banned from the post season to going to three of the last five Final Fours and five of the last six Elite Eights. For this the 1997 team was dubbed the \"Unbelievables\" for taking a team that was not expected much of to return the Wildcats back to the championship game for a second time. Pitino left Kentucky in 1997 to coach the NBA's Boston Celtics, he then went on to coach Kentucky's in-state rival, the University of Louisville. Orlando \"Tubby\" Smith was introduced by UK Athletic Director C.M. Newton as the Wildcats' 20th head coach on May 12, 1997, charged with the unenviable task of replacing popular coach Rick Pitino. The Wildcats were at the top of the basketball world at the time, having won a national title in 1996 and, according to many, missing a second straight title in 1997 by the torn ACL of shooting guard Derek Anderson.[41] (Anderson tore his ACL in January against SEC foe Auburn; Kentucky lost the 1997 title game in overtime to the Arizona Wildcats.) The team Smith inherited sported seven players from the Arizona loss, and five from the 1996 championship team. However, since most of the players who had left after the 1996 and 1997 seasons were high NBA draft picks, his team had the lowest pre-season ranking since Kentucky came off probation in 1991.[42] In his first season at UK, he coached the Wildcats to their seventh NCAA championship, including a come-from-behind victory against Duke in the Elite Eight, and another comeback win against Stanford, then Utah in the Finals. His 1998 National Championship is unique in modern times, as being along with 1985 Villanova the 2nd team in over 20 years to win without a First Team All American or future NBA Lottery Pick (see 1998 NCAA tournament). The 1998 team was also unlike Kentucky's past two championship teams, often falling behind in games before roaring back to win rather than dominating their competition. Smith's teams, known primarily for a ball line defense-oriented slower style of play coined \"Tubbyball\", received mixed reviews among Kentucky fans who have historically enjoyed a faster, higher-scoring style of play under previous coaches. Smith was also under pressure from Kentucky fans to recruit better players. After leading Kentucky to one National Championship in 1998, Kentucky would complete a perfect 16â0 regular season conference record in 2003, win five SEC regular season championships (1998, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2005) and five SEC Tournament titles (1998, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2004). Smith led the Wildcats to six Sweet Sixteen appearances (1998, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005) and four Elite Eight appearances (1998, 1999, 2003, 2005) in his ten seasons. He totaled 100 wins quicker than any other Wildcat coach before him except Hall of Famer Adolph Rupp, reaching the plateau in 130 games (John Calipari subsequently broke this record in 114 games). In 2003, he was named AP College Coach of the Year. In 1998, the reserve guard J.P. Blevins scored 9 points, all on 3-pointers sparking the Wildcats to come back from a 15-point deficit in the first half to upset the number 5 seed, Michigan State 60â58. Averaging only 2.2 points a game all season, Blevins was the unlikely hero for the Wildcats who were 6â4, to give the Spartans who were 8-3 an unlikely upset. Especially since they fell behind 26â11 in the first half.[43] Although Smith compiled an impressive resume during his UK career, he came under considerable pressure from many UK fans, who believed that his failure to achieve even a single Final Four appearance in his last nine seasons was inadequate by UK standards. He was infamously dubbed \"Ten Loss Tubby\" by several disgruntled UK fans. Smith's Final Four drought is the longest of any coach in UK history,[44] although Smith did come just a double-overtime loss short of another Final Four appearance in 2005. On March 22, 2007, Smith resigned his position of UK Head Coach to accept the head coach position at the University of Minnesota.[45] On April 6, 2007, Billy Gillispie was formally announced as the new head coach of the University of Kentucky by UK athletic director Mitch Barnhart. He fielded questions from the media during the press conference held at UK's new practice facility, the Joe Craft Center. He expressed his excitement and joy to be not only considered for the position but to have been given the honor and the opportunity to coach what former UK coach Rick Pitino referred to as the \"Roman Empire\" of college basketball. \"I'm very, very grateful and honored to be here, but we have a lot of work to do.\"[46] Gillispie became only the sixth head coach in the last 76 years at the school.[47] Gillispie's second season again started out rocky in 2008 as the 'Cats fell to Virginia Military Institute in their season opener. The second game of the season saw the Wildcats fall to North Carolina by 19 points. UK rebounded to win 11 of their next 12 games, improving their record to 11â3. On January 4, the Wildcats lost a heart breaker to archrival Louisville 74â71 after a 25 ft. shot by Edgar Sosa with 2.3 seconds remaining in the game. Prior to the shot, UK was down 7 with 38.5 seconds left, and Jodie Meeks was fouled shooting a three, proceeded to make all three free throw shots, Patrick Patterson stole an inbound and passed it to Meeks who laid it in to bring the game to 71â69 with 29.6 left, and then an inbound pass went long and Meeks snatched the pass, drove to the hoop and was fouled, and then made both free throws to tie the game at 71 with 22.9 left. So all in all, UK and Meeks got seven points in about 15 seconds to tie the game.[48] Kentucky disposed of Vanderbilt to win their SEC opener on January 10, 70â60. On January 13, in a road game against Tennessee, Jodie Meeks set a new Kentucky scoring record by dropping 54 points on the Volunteers. This total bested Dan Issel's 39-year-old scoring record by 1 point, and propelled UK to a 90â72 win and 2â0 start in conference play.[49] Kentucky followed up this effort with a 68â45 victory at Georgia, improving to 14â4 on the season. With wins over Auburn and Alabama, Kentucky moved to 5â0 in the SEC. On January 26, UK was ranked in the AP Poll (24th) for the first time since week 1 of the 2007â08 season.[50] UK promptly dropped 3 in a row (to Ole Miss, South Carolina, and Mississippi State) before rebounding at home with a thrilling 68â65 win over Florida. Jodie Meeks scored 23 points in the contest, including the fade-away contested 3-point basket with less than 5 seconds remaining to seal the win for UK. On Valentine's Day Kentucky handily defeated Arkansas at Bud Walton Arena 79â63 behind another strong performance from Meeks. Meeks contributed 45 points and helped UK win despite the absence of Patrick Patterson (sprained ankle). With the win, UK remained tied with South Carolina and Tennessee for 1st in the SEC East at 7â3.[51] Following the win UK completely collapsed, losing 5 of its last 6 games to finish the regular season 19â12 with an 8â8 SEC record. Entering the SEC tournament many felt UK would need to win the championship game to get into the NCAA tournament, but UK was defeated in the second game vs. LSU. With an unimpressive regular season and quick elimination in the SEC tournament, UK did indeed miss the NCAA tournament for the first time in 18 years and instead received an invitation to the NIT tournament where the team was defeated in the quarterfinal round against Notre Dame.[52][53] On March 27, 2009, an 18-minute-long meeting occurred between Billy Gillispie, President Dr. Lee Todd, Jr. and Athletic Director Mitch Barnhart, after which it was announced that Gillispie would not be returning as the head coach the next season. Barnhart stressed the firing was due to more than wins and losses, citing \"philosophical differences\" and \"a clear gap in how the rules and responsibilities overseeing the program are viewed\".[54] On April 1, 2009, John Calipari replaced former head coach Billy Gillispie as the Wildcats head coach. To begin his tenure at the University of Kentucky, John Calipari signed one of the best all time recruiting classes.[55] The class was headlined by four five-star recruits: John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins, Daniel Orton, and Eric Bledsoe.[56] On December 19, 2009, the Wildcats defeated Austin Peay 90â69 extending their record to 11â0, and John Calipari broke Adolph Rupp's record for the most consecutive wins to start a season for a first-year head coach at Kentucky. Kentucky defeated the Drexel Dragons 88â44 on December 21, 2009, to become the first program in college basketball history to claim their 2000th victory.[57] By January 25, 2010, Coach \"Cal\" had the Kentucky Wildcats ranked No. 1 in both the ESPN/Coaches poll and AP poll with a record of 19â0.[58] Calipari helped raise in excess of $1.5 million to aid the country of Haiti during the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. President Barack Obama called the Wildcats to thank them for their relief efforts and wish them luck in their future endeavors. To finish off the 2009â10 regular season, Kentucky won its 44th SEC regular season championship (with a final 14â2 SEC record), and won its 26th SEC tournament championship, beating Mississippi State in the finals. The Wildcats then received a No. 1 seed (their 10th No. 1 seed in history) in the East Regional of the NCAA tournament, where they eventually lost to West Virginia in the Elite Eight. This also marked Kentucky's record 50th NCAA Tournament appearance. In 2011 the Wildcats got off to a good start in the regular season with a record of 12â2, with their only losses being North Carolina away and UConn in the Maui Invitational Finals. Conference play was a different matter, and Kentucky would struggle in the SEC losing 6 out of their 8 away games, all of one were against unranked opponents. To close out the season with a three-game defeat No. 13 Florida, No. 23 Vanderbilt and Tennessee at home for a 22â8 record. The hot streak would continue and Kentucky would win their 27th SEC Tournament Title. This was enough for No. 4 seed on the East regional where they played Princeton in a very close first-round game that ended in a 59â57 victory for the Cats. Knight, Jones and company would exact their revenge in the second round against West Virginia, who knocked off Kentucky in the 2010 tourney. In the Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight they would upset the No. 1 seed Ohio State Buckeyes and No. 2 seed North Carolina Tar Heels on their way to the school's 14th Final Four. They lost in the Final Four to eventual National Champion No. 3 seed UConn 56â55. In the 2011â12 season, Calipari led Kentucky to being 16â0 in SEC regular season play, clinching its 45th SEC regular season championship. The last team to do so in the SEC was the 2002â03 Kentucky Wildcats, and before that, the 1995â96 Kentucky Wildcats. Kentucky's regular season record was 30â1, with its only loss being by one point coming from a 3-pointer buzzer-beater by the Indiana Hoosiers' Christian Watford at Assembly Hall on December 10, 2011. In the SEC Tournament, Kentucky fell to Vanderbilt in the championship game, making its overall record 32â2 going into the NCAA tournament. Kentucky was both selected as the No. 1 seed in the South Region and also the No. 1 seed overall of the entire NCAA Tournament. The Sweet 16 match-up on March 23, 2012, was a rematch against Indiana, in which this time the Wildcats prevailed over the Hoosiers 102â90. On March 25, 2012, Kentucky won the South Regional, setting up a Final Four semifinal with the Louisville Cardinals. Calipari's Wildcats defeated the Cardinals (coached by former Kentucky coach Rick Pitino) by a score of 69â61. This sent Kentucky to the National Championship game against the Kansas Jayhawks, where they defeated Kansas 67â59, winning UK's 8th NCAA championship, along with John Calipari's first NCAA Championship as a head coach. This Kentucky team had a record six players drafted in the 2012 NBA draft, including the first time two teammates have been chosen with the first two picks: Anthony Davis (1st overall), Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (2nd), Terrence Jones (18th), Marquis Teague (29th), Doron Lamb (42nd) and Darius Miller (46th). The 2012â13 season's recruiting class ranked either first or second by various recruiting experts led by top center Nerlens Noel, guard Archie Goodwin, forward Alex Poythress, and four-star center Willie Cauley-Stein. Kentucky also brought in transfer guard Julius Mays, a graduate student who had previously played at Wright State University and North Carolina State. Mays was eligible to play immediately, because UK offered a master's degree program that Wright State did not. However, the only returner that saw significant minutes from the championship squad was back-up power forward Kyle Wiltjer, who averaged 11 minutes per game (Ryan Harrow sat out the previous season after transferring from NC State before the 2011â12 season). Although the team saw the rise of Jarrod Polson in the first game of the season against Maryland, they struggled to close out closer games and play with the will to win that Calipari demands. On February 12, Noel tore his ACL in a loss against Florida. UK was 17â7 including that game, and went 4â5 the remainder of the season, losing all 5 games away from Rupp Arena. The fourth of those losses was against Vanderbilt in the first round of the SEC tournament, and UK missed the NCAA tournament altogether, being the overall No. 1 seed of the NIT. UK was upset by Robert Morris in the first round of the NIT, ending their season with a 21â12 record. In the press conference following the loss to Robert Morris, Calipari stated that his 2013â14 team would be a \"tough, hard-nosed, fighting team.\" Noel and Goodwin both entered the NBA draft and were both taken in the first round at 6th and 29th, respectively. Ryan Harrow transferred to Georgia State to be closer to his father that had suffered from a stroke, and Kyle Wiltjer transferred to Gonzaga. Kentucky brought in the No. 1 recruiting class, featuring a record six McDonald's All-Americans in Julius Randle, Andrew Harrison, Aaron Harrison, James Young, Dakari Johnson, and Marcus Lee, as well as Kentucky natives Derek Willis and Dominique Hawkins, and walk-on E. J. Floreal (son of Edrick FlorÃ©al, head coach of UK's track and field team). Alex Poythress and Willie Cauley-Stein did not declare for the 2013 NBA draft, and decided to return for their sophomore seasons. In 2013â14, Kentucky looked to make up for its struggles in the previous season. Despite making the NIT, there were high expectations for this team. The team, however, would be without some of its top players from the 2012â13 team including Nerlens Noel[59] and starting shooting guard Archie Goodwin,[60] who were first-round draft choices in the 2013 NBA draft. Starting power forward Kyle Wiltjer transferred to Gonzaga[61] and starting point guard Ryan Harrow transferred to Georgia State.[62] Returning was former McDonald's All-American Alex Poythress and starting center Willie Cauley-Stein.[60] The poor success of the 2012â13 team did not stop John Calipari from again producing another number one recruiting class. The entering class included a record six McDonald's All-Americans[63] highlighted by Julius Randle and the Harrison Twins from Texas, Aaron and Andrew. Many recruiting analysts and experts proclaimed that the 2013 signing class was the greatest recruiting class since the infamous Fab Five in the 1990s.[64] The team began the season ranked number one in both the AP and Coaches polls.[65][66] The season was full of ups and downs. Early in the season the team experienced close losses to Baylor, Michigan State, and North Carolina. Despite those losses the team was able to defeat in-state rival Louisville. Nothing changed in SEC play for them either. The team ended the regular season losing three of their last four games including once to South Carolina, who finished the season 14â20 overall. The team limped into the SEC tournament unranked, and desperately looking for any answer to their disappointing season. Calipari during his weekly radio call-in show mentioned the team was given a \"tweak\".[67] The \"tweak\" sparked speculation and curiosity among the fans and the media to what it could be. The \"tweak\" was never fully revealed. However, the \"tweak\" caused the team to go on an historic run through both the SEC and NCAA tournaments. UK was the runner-up to number one Florida in the SEC Tournament. During the NCAA tournament UK became the first team in history to eliminate three teams from the previous Final Four (Wichita State, Louisville, Michigan). UK was the National Runner-up after losing to Connecticut in the national championship game. After the 2014 season, Kentucky only lost Julius Randle and James Young to the NBA draft.[68][69] The returning players consisted of a record-tying nine McDonald's All-Americans. Juniors Cauley-Stein and Poythress returned with sophomores Aaron and Andrew Harrison, Johnson, and Lee to join the No. 2 ranked 2015 recruiting class which was highlighted of Gatorade Player of the Year Karl-Anthony Towns for the 2015 season.[70] The team began its season in the Bahamas on a six-game tour against international clubs and teams.[71] While in the Bahamas the team established a \"platoon system\" which featured two groups of five players that would rotate every four minutes within the game.[72] The \"platoon system\" was put on display nationally in a 72â40 victory over No. 5 Kansas in the Champions Classic in November.[73] In December, the team defeated UCLA 83â44. Kentucky led 41â7 at halftime, the lowest UCLA point total for a half in its storied history.[74] The SEC regular season began with two overtime victories over Ole Miss and Texas A&M, the closest games Kentucky would play all season. Kentucky finished the regular season with a perfect 31â0 record, the best start in school history.[75] In the SEC tournament, the team won each game by double digits, including a 78â63 victory over Arkansas in the finals. Cauley-Stein was named the MVP of the Tournament. In the NCAA tournament Kentucky played its first two games at the KFC Yum! Center in Louisville. Prior to the regional semifinal against West Virginia, Mountaineers guard Daxter Miles proclaimed that Kentucky would be 36â1 after the game. The comment fueled the team as they defeated West Virginia 78â39, tying the largest margin of victory in the Sweet 16 in NCAA Tournament history.[76] In the regional final Kentucky narrowly defeated Notre Dame 68â66. The only loss of the season was in the Final Four to Wisconsin, who Kentucky defeated the previous season in the Final Four. The 2014â15 team tied the NCAA record for most wins in a season (38).[77] After the season Cauley-Stein and Towns were named consensus All-Americans among other awards received. The Kentucky Wildcats represented USA Basketball, at Globl Jam 2023, and defeated Canada to win the gold medal. Following a first round upset as a 2 seed in the 2024 NCAA Tournament, John Calipari resigned his position of Head Coach to accept the same role at the University of Arkansas. He was officially announced as the Razorbacks Head Coach on April 10, 2024, marking the end of his storied tenure at Kentucky. On April 12, 2024, Kentucky hired BYU head coach Mark Pope for the same position in Lexington,[78] days after Calipari left for the vacant head coaching post at Arkansas.[79] Pope was a member of the Wildcats' 1995-1996 team that won the NCAA Tournament. The Wildcats have had 23 coaches in their 112-year history. Mark Pope is the current head coach. Six Wildcats coaches have won the National Coach-of-the-Year award: Adolph Rupp in 1950, 1954, 1959, 1966, and 1970, Joe B. Hall in 1978, Eddie Sutton in 1986, Rick Pitino in 1990 and 1992, Tubby Smith in 1998, 2003, and 2005, and John Calipari in 2012 and 2015. Additionally, seven Wildcats coaches have been named Southeastern Conference Coach-of-the-Year: Adolph Rupp in 1964, 1966, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971 and 1972, Joe B. Hall in 1973, 1975, 1978 and 1983, Eddie Sutton in 1986, Rick Pitino in 1990, 1991 and 1996, Tubby Smith in 1998, 2003, and 2005, Billy Gillispie in 2008, and John Calipari in 2010, 2012, and 2015.[80] The following is a list of Kentucky's 8 National Championships: The NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition. The * represents overall number one seed which began with the 2004 Tournament. Kentucky has 42 men's basketball players, coaches, and contributors honored in Rupp Arena with banners representing their numbers hung from the rafters. Due to the number of players honored, the fact that several of them have shared numbers, the numbers are not officially retired. Some of the jersey numbers were before the NCAA rule change before the 1957â58 season that outlawed teams wearing jerseys with a number higher than 5 on it that was not changed until 2023.[81] To have a banner hung, the individual must be elected to the UK Athletics Hall of Fame.[82] The following Kentucky players, coaches, and contributors have been enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. The following Kentucky players and coaches have represented their country in basketball in the Summer Olympic Games: The Kentucky Wildcats presently play their home games in 20,545-seat Rupp Arena. When it opened in 1976, it was the largest arena in the United States built specifically for basketball, and retained that status for much of the following 40-plus years. It was opened in 1976 and is named after legendary Kentucky head coach Adolph Rupp. Located off-campus, in downtown Lexington, the facility's official capacity was 23,500+[89] until a renovation project in the 2019 offseason reduced the capacity to 20,545.[90] The Wildcats have consistently led the country in home attendance since the 1976â77 season (when Rupp Arena first opened), winning the National Attendance Title a record 25 times, including 17 of the past 20 seasons, and 8 of the last 10 seasons. Kentucky also has an impressive 529â64 (.892) all-time record in Rupp Arena.[91] In 2007, the university unveiled the Joe Craft Center, a state-of-the-art basketball practice facility and athletics office building attached to the north side of Memorial Coliseum on the \"Avenue of Champions\" at the University of Kentucky campus in Lexington, Kentucky.[91] The 102,000 ft2 structure contains separate practice courts for the men's and women's basketball programs, separate men's and women's locker rooms, state-of-the-art video rooms for game film viewing, new coaches offices, a ticket office, and athletic administration offices.[92] As a result, Memorial Coliseum has more ample space for volleyball and gymnastics practice and games. The facility is named after businessman and philanthropist Joe Craft, a Hazard, Kentucky native, who pledged $6 million towards the completion of the $30 million project.[92][93] Coming off back-to-back national championships, the team moved to Memorial Coliseum in 1950. Nicknamed \"The House That Rupp Built\", the multipurpose facility cost $4 million and seated 12,000 people. It also housed a swimming pool, physical education equipment, and offices for the athletics staff. The team occupied Memorial Coliseum for twenty-six seasons, and sold out all 345 home games they played there during that period. Kentucky also played a 2009 NIT game at Memorial Coliseum due to Rupp Arena being booked. The Wildcats are 307â38 (.890) all-time at Memorial Coliseum.[89][91][94] Today, Memorial Coliseum is home to three UK women's teamsâbasketball, gymnastics, and volleyball. In 1924, Alumni Gymnasium was completed. It included seating for 2,800 people and cost $92,000 to construct.[95] Kentucky played 271 games at Alumni Gymnasium from 1924 to 1950, going 247â24 (.911).[91][96] After a major renovation completed in 2018, it is now a student recreation facility known as Alumni Gym Fitness Center.[97] Woodland Park Auditorium, opened in 1906 and closed in 1941, was located on the corner of East High Street and Kentucky Avenue in Lexington, Kentucky. Kentucky used this facility for home games during World War I between 1914 and 1916 going 15â7 there all-time.[91][98] The Wildcats played 84 home games at Buell Armory Gymnasium from 1910 to 1924. It was named for Union Civil War General Don Carlos Buell who was a member of the first board of trustees at Kentucky.[99] The armory was also used during World War I to teach truck maintenance and repair among other skills.[100] Kentucky was 59â25 all-time at Buell Armory Gymnasium.[101] The first home court for the Wildcats was simply called \"The Gymnasium\" or State College Gymnasium until 1910. It was located in the north wing of Barker Hall on the university campus. Constructed in 1902, it also housed the university's physical education classes until 1909. The facility had a capacity of 650 people, and with no bleachers or seats, fans had to stand to watch the games that were played there.[95] By the 1920s, it had become clear that \"The Gymnasium\" (by then renamed \"The Ladies' Gym\") was inadequate to house the university's basketball team. Records show Kentucky was 17â14 at State College Gymnasium.[91][100][102] (Of the 71 major categories listed above, Kentucky is No. 1 in 50 of them, No. 2 in 16 of them, No. No. 3 in 3 of them, No. 4 in 1 of them, and No. 8 in 1 of them.) Kentucky can also lay claim to several individual achievements for both players and coaches: Kentucky also holds several other NCAA records and various additional accomplishments:",

                "title": "Tennessee Volunteers basketball - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Tennessee Volunteers men's basketball team is the collegiate men's basketball program for the University of TennesseeâKnoxville. The Volunteers (commonly referred to as the \"Vols\") compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The Volunteers play their home games in ThompsonâBoling Arena, on a court nicknamed \"the Summitt\", after former Tennessee Lady Vols basketball coach Pat Summitt. With a current capacity of 21,678 (formerly 24,535), Tennessee has consistently ranked in the top 15 in the nation in terms of volume of attendance, averaging 14,817 (60.39% capacity) attendance from 1988 through 2006, and averaging 17,194 (79.34% capacity) attendance from 2007 through 2018 after reducing seating capacity prior to the 2007 season.[2][3] Historically, Tennessee ranks third in the SEC in all-time wins.[4] Many notable players have played collegiately at Tennesseeâplayers such as Bernard King, Dale Ellis, Allan Houston, Tobias Harris, Grant Williams, and Dalton Knecht who all play(ed) in the NBA. Chris Lofton, Ron Slay, Tyler Smith, and John Fulkerson are also notable players who later played professionally in other leagues. The Volunteers are currently coached by Rick Barnes, who was hired on March 31, 2015, to replace Donnie Tyndall. In 1963, the University of Tennessee hired Ray Mears to become the head coach of the men's basketball program. The hiring of Mears, who was coming off an NCAA small college championship at Wittenberg University, ushered in the most sustained period of success in Tennessee men's basketball history. In his first year, Mears's Volunteers improved from a 4â19 record in 1962 to 13â11, highlighted by two wins over the Kentucky Wildcats. Before Mears, Tennessee had only beaten the Wildcats twice in 39 meetings. Throughout his career, Mears gained notoriety throughout the SEC for frequently being a thorn in the powerhouse Kentucky's side.[citation needed] In an era where Kentucky was coached by future College Basketball Hall of Fame members Adolph Rupp and Joe B. Hall, winning 75% of their games, Mears recorded a 15â15 record against the Wildcats. Led by A. W. Davis, the Volunteers finished second in the SEC in each of the next two seasons and recorded 20 wins in 1965, reaching that mark for the first time in 17 years. This success and the resultant growing fan support led to the university's decision to expand the 7,500-seat Amory-Fieldhouse to 12,700 seats. It was renamed Stokely Athletic Center to honor William B. Stokely, whose donation funded the renovation. In the expanded Stokely Center's inaugural season, the Volunteers captured the 1967 SEC championship and made the program's first-ever NCAA tournament appearance. Dubbed the \"Fearless Five,\" the 1967 team won road games against top conference teams Florida, Kentucky, and Mississippi State. The win over Mississippi State, coming in double-overtime on a pair of Bill Justus free throws, secured Tennessee's first SEC championship in 24 years and is referred to by some as the greatest basketball game in Tennessee history.[citation needed] From 1968 to 1973, Mears kept Tennessee among the top teams of the SEC, winning a second SEC championship in 1972 and finishing second in every year except 1970. In 1974, Mears and his trusted assistant Stu Aberdeen were able to recruit New York City standout forward Ernie Grunfeld to Knoxville. In his freshman season, Grunfeld led the team in scoring, averaging 17.4 points per game, and received first-team All-SEC honors. The following season, Grunfeld was joined by fellow New Yorker Bernard King. Known as \"The Ernie and Bernie Show,\" King and Grunfeld led the Volunteers to a 61â20 record over three years and an SEC championship in 1977. During their three years together, Tennessee posted a 5â1 record against Kentucky. The Volunteers reached the National Invitation Tournament in 1975 and the NCAA tournament in 1976 and 1977. King was named first-team All-American and SEC Player of the Year in 1975 and 1976, and then shared the honor with Grunfeld in 1977, with both being named SEC Co-Player of the Year. Grunfeld graduated from Tennessee in 1977 and King chose to forgo his senior year to enter the NBA draft. King was drafted 7th overall to the New Jersey Nets and Grunfeld went 11th overall to the Milwaukee Bucks. Both enjoyed long and illustrious NBA careers. Perhaps the biggest impact of the \"Ernie and Bernie\" show was how it changed the national perception of the Tennessee basketball program.[citation needed] This \"Double Trouble from Tennessee\" was featured in the February 1976 edition of Sports Illustrated.[5] In 2013, ESPN premiered a 30 for 30 documentary called \"Bernie and Ernie\" about the all-time great Volunteer basketball players. Following the exit of his two biggest stars, Mears, who long struggled with depression,[6] was not able to coach the team in 1978. Under the watch of interim coach Cliff Wettig, the Volunteers struggled to an 11â16 record, and Mears officially retired for health reasons after the season.[7] Mears is remembered not only as the greatest coach in Tennessee men's basketball history, but also as a great entertainer and marketer.[citation needed] From the beginning of his time at Tennessee, Mears employed marketing tactics to get fans to gamesâfrom his patented and provocative orange blazer, to his introduction of the Pride of the Southland Band to basketball games, to his entertaining pre-game warmups that compared to the Harlem Globetrotters for creativity.[8] At the beginning of his tenure, Mears declared, \"This is Big Orange Country,\" and this slogan has lived on long past his coaching years.[9] Don DeVoe was named Mears's successor and took over as head coach for the 1979 season. Despite the losing record in 1978, DeVoe inherited a roster centered on All-American center Reggie Johnson. DeVoe's 1979 Volunteers finished the regular season with a 21â12 record, beating Kentucky twice and earning a second-place finish in the SEC. The 1979 SEC tournament was the first held in 27 years, and the Volunteers reached the tournament finals, where they once again defeated Kentucky by a score of 75â69 to win their first SEC Tournament championship since 1943. With the tournament championship win, the Volunteers were invited back to the NCAA tournament, where they recorded the program's first NCAA tournament win with a defeat of Eastern Kentucky. Tennessee was eliminated in the second round with a loss to Notre Dame. DeVoe led Tennessee to the NCAA tournament each of the next five years, but none of his teams advanced past the second round. Through his first seven years at UT, DeVoe compiled an overall record of 143â79 (.644). The program's momentum under his direction eventually weakened, however, and the Volunteers were not invited to the NCAA tournament or the NIT in 1986 or 1987. Entering the 1989 season, DeVoe's 11th year at Tennessee, his teams had not reached the NCAA tournament or finished above 6th in the SEC since 1983. DeVoe led the Volunteers to a 19â11 record and a berth in the NCAA tournament. After an 84â68 loss to West Virginia in the first round, DeVoe resigned. The growth of UT basketball under DeVoe is still seen today in the Vols' current home arena, ThompsonâBoling Arena, which was built during his tenure. By the mid-1980s, the overflow crowds had grown too large for the 12,700-seat Stokley Athletic Center. In 1988, the Volunteers moved to the new $30 million ThompsonâBoling Arena, which seated over 24,500 peopleâat the time, the largest facility ever built specifically for basketball in the United States. Sitting on the banks of the Tennessee River nearby historic Neyland Stadium, the arena has accommodated 21,678 people since a 2007 renovation. In 1990, Wade Houston, an Alcoa, Tennessee native and former assistant coach at Louisville, became the first African-American head coach in Tennessee and SEC history. Houston's son, Allan Houston, came to UT to play for his father and would become one of the most accomplished players in Tennessee history. With 2801 points, Allan Houston finished his career as Tennessee's all-time leading scorer and was named All-American in 1992 and 1993. Houston was fired after a 5â22 campaign in 1994, finishing the worst season in Tennessee history. None of his teams reached the NCAA tournament, and only two of his teams received invitations to the NIT, the two of which were also his only teams to finish with winning records. Houston finished with an overall record of 65â90 at Tennessee. Houston was replaced by Kevin O'Neill in 1995. O'Neillâan intense and somewhat high-strung sideline coach, but also a skilled recruiter[citation needed]âtook over a program depleted in talent. He was able to sign talented players such as Brandon Wharton, Tony Harris, and Isiah Victor. O'Neill left Tennessee to become the head coach at Northwestern after the 1997 season. O'Neill was replaced by Oregon Ducks head coach Jerry Green. Green inherited a roster with significant young talent and was able to an immediate improvement in on-court success. His first Tennessee team produced a 20â9 overall recordâa nine-win improvement over the 11â16 record of O'Neill's third and final UT teamâand advanced to the 1998 NCAA tournament. In his second year, Green's Volunteers won the 1999 SEC East Division championship and defeated Kentucky twice in the same season for the first time since 1979, in what is generally regarded to be the best overall year in school athletics history. (The 1998 Tennessee Football team finished 13â0 and won the first-ever BCS National Championship. In women's basketball, Pat Summitt led the Lady Volunteers to a 39â0 NCAA championship season, the program's third consecutive national title.) The 2000 Tennessee men's basketball team finished 26â7, repeating as SEC East champions, winning the Volunteers' first SEC championship since 1982, and setting a program record for most wins in a single season. In the NCAA tournament, the Volunteers advanced to the first Sweet Sixteen in school history, where they lost a close contest to North Carolina. Green's Volunteers began the 2001 season with a 16â1 record, rising to No. 4 in the AP Poll. Beginning with a ten-point loss at Kentucky in mid-January, Tennessee then struggled to a 22â11 finish. Green's team advanced to the NCAA tournamentâthe fourth appearance in Green's four seasonsâlosing in the first round. Coupled with his multiple incidents with local media and Tennessee fans,[10] this disappointing finish to the season led to Green's resignation. He was replaced by Buzz Peterson, who failed to lead the program to an NCAA tournament berth in his four years as head coach. He was fired after the 2005 season, in which his team finished 14â17. After taking WisconsinâMilwaukee to a Sweet Sixteen in 2005, Bruce Pearl was hired as the new Tennessee men's basketball coach. Pearl's assistants Tony Jones, Steve Forbes, Jacob Nichols, Jason Shay, and Ken Johnson were part of a staff that would help to lead the Volunteers to the NCAA tournament six years in a row. Pearl inherited a roster that had not experienced much winning, but showed promise with future NBA senior point guard C. J. Watson and All-SEC freshman team shooting guard Chris Lofton. Pearl's coaching, which included playing an up-tempo style and pressing defense, led to immediate gains for Tennessee. In his first season, Pearl led the Volunteers to a 22â8 record, an SEC East Division championship, and a no. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament. Pearl's first team achieved some of the more memorable wins in program history, including two wins against the eventual national champion Florida Gators. Another memorable win came when Chris Lofton, who is a Kentucky native, led the Volunteers over Kentucky in Rupp Arena for the program's first win there since 1999. Pearl's 2006 recruiting class was ranked among the top ten in college basketball.[11] Despite the influx of freshmen and their inexperience, the Volunteers were able to open with a 13â2 start to the season. All-American guard Chris Lofton was injured and missed a good portion of January and early February, during which time the Volunteers opened 3â5 in SEC play. After Lofton returned, Tennessee won 7 out of their last 8 regular season games. Given a no. 5 seed, the Volunteers returned to the Sweet Sixteen where they faced no. 1 seed Ohio State. Tennessee led 49â32 at halftime, but the eventual NCAA runner-up Buckeyes mounted a comeback to defeat the Volunteers by a score of 85â84. During the 2006â07 season, the Volunteers were ranked 4th nationally in attendance, with an average of 19,661 fans in ThompsonâBoling Arena, which has a capacity of 21,758. This marked an increase in attendance of an average of 7,436 per game since Pearl arrived in March 2005.[citation needed] Preseason expectations for the Volunteers were high entering the 2008 season.[12] Chris Lofton was a preseason pick by some to win National Player of the Year, and he was joined by Tyler Smith, an All-Big Ten freshman transfer from Iowa. Senior guards JaJuan Smith and Jordan Howell, along with rising sophomores Wayne Chism and Ramar Smith, propelled the Volunteers to a preseason no. 7 ranking. The team posted a record of 28â3 in the regular season. The season was highlighted by the rivalry matchup between Tennessee and Memphis. John Calipari's Tigers were undefeated and ranked no. 1 and the Volunteers were no. 2. In front the largest TV audience to date to ever watch a game on ESPN, the two teams remained evenly matched for thirty-nine minutes. The Volunteers trailed 61â60 with 30 seconds left before Tyler Smith made a jump-shot to give UT the lead. The Volunteers added three free throws and took the contest by a score of 66â62. The following Monday, Tennessee was ranked no. 1 in polls for the first time in school history. The Volunteers finished the regular season as the outright SEC champions and the no. 1 seed for the SEC Tournament in Atlanta. The Volunteers won their first game to set up a semifinal matchup against Arkansas in the Georgia Dome. The night before the game, an EF2 tornado hit Downtown Atlanta, damaging the Georgia Dome and much of the surrounding area. Because of this, the tournament was nearly canceled but was ultimately moved to Georgia Tech's Alexander Memorial Coliseum. The Razorbacks were able to upset the Volunteers, denying them a place in the final and a shot at their first SEC Tournament championship in 30 years. The Volunteers received a no. 2 seed in the NCAA tournament. They advanced to the Sweet Sixteen, where they lost to the Louisville Cardinals men's basketball. Despite the disappointing ending, the 2008 season is remembered as one of the best in program history. Replacing Chris Lofton proved a difficult task in the 2009 season. Now led by Tyler Smith, the Volunteers finished with a 21â13 record. However, Tennessee claimed another SEC division championship. The Volunteers advanced to the SEC Tournament Championship in Tampa before losing to Mississippi State 64â61. The Volunteers lost their NCAA tournament first-round game to Oklahoma State. Entering the regular season ranked in the top 10, the Volunteers started the season 10â2. On New Year's Day, players Melvin Goins, Cam Tatum, Brian Williams, and leading scorer Tyler Smith were arrested after a traffic stop when police found marijuana and an illegal firearm.[13] The players were all suspended for multiple games and Tyler Smith was eventually dismissed from the team.[14] After the suspensions, the Volunteers were left with only six scholarship players. The Volunteers defeated Charlotte and then hosted no. 1 Kansas the next game. In front of a sellout crowd, the undermanned Volunteers defeated the Jayhawks 76â68. Tennessee cemented its lead with a shot clock-beating three-point shot with under a minute left by local freshman walk-on Skylar McBee, who entered the rotation due to the suspensions. Tennessee rode the momentum of the Kansas upset to a 23â7 regular season record. This included another upset of second-ranked Kentucky, which featured future NBA All-Stars John Wall and DeMarcus Cousins, as well as four other eventual NBA players. The Volunteers won 74â65 at home in front of a raucous crowd. The Wildcats were able to avenge the loss a week and half later in the SEC Tournament. As a no. 6 seed in a bracket featuring overall top seed Kansas, the Volunteers defeated a Steve Fisher-coached San Diego State team with Kawhi Leonard in the first round. No. 14 seed Ohio upset the no. 3 seed Georgetown Hoyas, setting up a matchup between the Volunteers and the Bobcats in the following round. After winning 83â68, Tennessee advanced to Bruce Pearl's third Sweet Sixteen in five years. In a rematch of the 2007 Sweet Sixteen, the Volunteers faced the Ohio State Buckeyes at the Edward Jones Dome in St. Louis. In a back and forth battle with the Evan Turner-led Buckeyes, Tennessee held a 76â73 lead with 13 seconds left. Turner missed a three-point shot, rebounded his own missed shot, and attempted a final three-point shot that was blocked by J. P. Prince, securing the Volunteers an appearance in the Elite Eight for the first time in program history. Tennessee faced Michigan State in the Elite Eight. After a fast start, the Vols sputtered in the second half and Michigan State was able to keep the game close. Down by one point with 11 seconds left, Tennessee's Scotty Hopson was set to attempt two free throws. He made the first but missed the second. With the score tied, Michigan State advanced the ball and was fouled on a fast break. Raymar Morgan made one of two free throws, and Michigan State was able to defeat Tennessee one game short of the Final Four. Tennessee opened the 2010â11 season with success, winning the Preseason NIT and rising as high as no. 7 in the national polls. In mid-December, the NCAA announced an investigation into Bruce Pearl for his role in a possible recruiting violation.[citation needed] SEC Commissioner Mike Slive suspended Pearl for the first half of the SEC season.[15] Tennessee faltered throughout the rest of the season to a 19â15 record. Tennessee appeared in the NCAA tournament for the sixth consecutive year under Pearl and faced Michigan in the opening round. The Volunteers were defeated 75â45 in what proved to be Pearl's last game. On March 21, 2011, the week after the loss, the university announced the firing of Pearl, based on Pearl's misconduct of lying to the NCAA in the ongoing investigation.[16] Pearl was eventually given a three-year show-cause penalty. On March 27, 2011, the University of Tennessee announced the hiring of Cuonzo Martin as the Volunteers' 18th head coach. Martin had spent the prior three seasons at Missouri State, where he compiled a record of 61â41. Martin was able to lead the Missouri State team from an 11â20 record and a last-place finish in the Missouri Valley Conference to a 26â9 record and a first-place conference finish. Martin took over a depleted roster with low expectations. After the departure of Tobias Harris following his freshman season, the Volunteers were picked to finish near the bottom of the SEC in 2011â12.[citation needed] With the emergence of Jordan McRae and Jeronne Maymon, and the mid-season addition of Jarnell Stokes, Martin took a team that had lost their top threeâand seven of their top tenâcontributors from the previous season to a second-place finish in the SEC, largely because of their tough defense and lack of turnovers. With an outside chance at the NCAA tournament, the Volunteers lost their first SEC tournament game to Ole Miss, ending their NCAA chances. They played in the NIT before losing in the second round. In 2012â13, the Volunteers started off slowly, posting an 11â10 record before finishing the regular season 8â1. UT was eliminated in the second round of the SEC Tournament and was left out of the NCAA tournament for the second straight year, finishing as one of the last teams out.[citation needed] Expectations were high heading into 2013â14 with a roster many felt could compete for a Sweet Sixteen appearance.[citation needed] However, the fans quickly grew vocally upset after another slow start of 16â11. A petition with thousands of signatures surfaced online for the firing of Cuonzo Martin and the re-hiring of Bruce Pearl, whose show-cause order was ending the next year.[citation needed] Whether the petition motivated the team or not, the Volunteers finished the season 5â1 and earned a place in the \"First Four\" round of the NCAA tournament. They defeated Iowa in the play-in game in Dayton, Ohio to move on to face the UMass Minutemen. Martin's Volunteers, who were the lower seed, were favored by many and easily defeated UMass. In one of the biggest upsets in tournament history, Mercer upset Duke, and the Volunteers went on to defeat Mercer to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. Tennessee then played Michigan in Indianapolis. In front of one of the largest crowds to witness a Sweet Sixteen game, the Volunteers' comeback fell short and UT lost to Michigan by a score of 73â71. Martin resigned from Tennessee and accepted the coaching job at California on April 15, 2014.[17] After a brief coaching search, Tennessee athletics director Dave Hart announced on April 21, 2014 that former Morehead State and Southern Mississippi head coach Donnie Tyndall would become the next head coach of the Tennessee Volunteers.[18] Tyndall inherited a roster that returned one contributing player from the previous year. Also, due to Jarnell Stokes's decision to enter the NBA draft and two other players transferring, Tyndall had to recruit and sign nearly one-third of the 2015 team's roster in less than a month. Under these circumstances, he led the 2015 team to a 16â16 record. After the season was over, Tennessee announced it was firing Tyndall with cause after it learned that he had lied to both UT and the NCAA about the severity of major NCAA violations that had occurred at Southern Miss.[19] Hart said that he would have never hired Tyndall had the true extent of the violations been known. By this time, it was clear that Tyndall would face severe penalties for his role in the violations, including a suspension for part of the season. According to ESPN, Hart and other officials were still smarting from Pearl having to sit out the first half of conference play three years earlier, and were not willing to face the prospect of an equally lengthy suspension for Tyndall.[20] While searching for its third basketball coach in four years, Tennessee sought to make a hire that would bring much-needed stability to the program.[citation needed] During the search process, news broke that Texas had fired their head coach of 17 years, Rick Barnes. Barnes, who had a prior connection to Tennessee athletics director Dave Hart, quickly surfaced as the frontrunner for the job.[citation needed] On March 31, 2015, Barnes was named the new Tennessee men's basketball coach. Barnes boasts the best record of any coach in school history, with an overall record of 604â314 from his previous tenures at Texas, Clemson, and Providence. Barnes is originally from nearby Hickory, North Carolina, and his wife, Candy, graduated from Tennessee in 1975.[21] The Rick Barnes era began on a winning note as Tennessee defeated UNC Asheville, 82â78 in Barnes' debut game at UT. In Barnes' third year as Tennessee's coach he completed quite the turnaround from the previous year's 16â16 (8â10) team, as his team would finish the regular season 26â9 (13â5) and capture a share of the SEC regular season title. This would be Tennessee's first regular season title since 2008 and tenth overall.[22] Tennessee also reached the SEC men's basketball championship final where they were defeated by Kentucky 77â72. In 2019, Tennessee experienced their best season record wise under Barnes. The Volunteers would earn a record of 31â6 (15â3) including an 18-game win streak and a no.1 ranking in the polls for the first time since the 2007â08 season. The Volunteers again reached the SEC men's basketball championship final where they were defeated by Auburn 84â64. The Volunteers proceeded to earn a #2 seed in the 2019 NCAA tournament, where they defeated Colgate 77â70 in the first round.[23] Tennessee overcame a resurgent Iowa Hawkeyes team in the second round by a score of 83â77 in an overtime thriller. The Volunteers fell to Purdue in the Sweet Sixteen in overtime after a thrilling come-from-behind run led by Volunteer guard Admiral Schofield. Purdue's Ryan Cline kept the Boilermakers in the game late and after a controversial call on Lamonte Turner, the Vols lost. Junior forward Grant Williams captured the 2018â19 SEC player of the year award, his second consecutive year obtaining the honor.[24] Source[25][26][27] National champion Postseason invitational champion Conference regular season champion Conference regular season and conference tournament champion Division regular season champion Division regular season and conference tournament champion Conference tournament champion Tennessee plays its home games in ThompsonâBoling Arena, which was at one time the largest facility ever built specifically for basketball in the United States, with a seating capacity of 24,678 until its 2007 renovation. Named for the late B. Ray Thompson and former UT President Dr. Edward J. Boling, the arena regularly hosts women's volleyball matches, concerts, camps, conferences, and other special events throughout the year. ThompsonâBoling Arena opened during the 1987â88 season, with Tennessee defeating Marquette 82â56 before a crowd of 25,272. In its opening season, the Volunteers finished third nationally in attendance, with an average attendance of more than 20,000 fans per game. Much of the facility's storied history has centered on men's and women's basketball. In the last two decades, the Volunteers and Lady Volunteers have hosted record college basketball crowds, as well as WNBA and NCAA tournament basketball games. The Volunteers have ranked fourth in the nation in average home attendance for each of the past three seasons, including an average of 20,483 fans per game in 2008â09. Tennessee's 1989 men's game against Kentucky set the SEC regular-season record with a crowd of 25,610. The Lady Volunteers drew 24,597 fans for their 1998 game with Connecticut to establish a women's NCAA record, while a Celtics-Bullets game in 1988 attracted a then-NBA-record exhibition crowd of 23,611. The arena's largest basketball crowd since its capacity was reduced to 21,678 prior to the 2007â08 season came on January 7, 2009, when the Vols hosted Gonzaga in front of a sellout crowd of 22,326. UT hosted the NCAA tournament's South Regional Finals in 1994 and 1999 in the spacious facility, as well as the 1990 NCAA Southeast Region's first- and second-round games and the NCAA women's 1990 Final Four. The 1989 SEC Tournament was the first of what promised to be many postseason tournaments to be held in ThompsonâBoling Arena. The riverfront arena has drawn rave reviews from teams, administrators, and media for its modern facilities needed for hosting major tournaments. The Volunteers have appeared in the NCAA tournament 26 times. Their combined record is 28â27. The Volunteers have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 13 times. Their combined record is 13â13. â : First Team All-American Tennessee has retired five jersey numbers.[30][31][32][33][34]",

He played college football at Boston College and was selected by the Ravens in the first round of the 2023 NFL draft. Flowers was born to Willie Flowers and Jackie Walden on September 11, 2000.[1] When Flowers was five years old, his mother died from a head injury.[2] The 11th of 14 children, Flowers grew up in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and attended NSU University School.[3][4] While Flowers was in high school, his brother, Martin, was murdered.[2] As a junior, he caught 48 passes for 631 yards and 10 touchdowns.[5] While at NSU, Flowers played wide receiver and cornerback, helping the team to back to back state semifinal appearances.[3] As a 3-star prospect, he ranked as the nation's 135th receiver recruit and committed to play college football at Boston College.[6] As a true freshman, Flowers caught 22 passes for 341 yards and three touchdowns.[7] After Boston College closed their campus in March 2020 due to COVID-19, he returned to Florida and worked out on occasion with NFL players Antonio Brown and Geno Smith.[8] Flowers became the second wide receiver in school history to be named first team All-Atlantic Coast Conference after finishing his sophomore season with 56 receptions for 892 yards and nine touchdowns.[9][10] He was named third-team All-ACC after catching 44 passes for 746 yards and five touchdowns.[11] During his career at Boston College, Flowers broke numerous records, including first in career touchdowns, receptions, and receiving yards.[12] On December 1, 2022, Flowers declared for the 2023 NFL draft.[13][14] Flowers was selected by the Baltimore Ravens as the 22nd overall pick in the 2023 NFL draft.[17] On June 15, Flowers signed a 4-year, $14 million fully guaranteed rookie contract.[18] In Week 1 against the Houston Texans, he led the team with nine catches for 78 yards in 25â9 win.

He finished the game with 62 total yards.[21] In Week 17, after scoring a 75-yard touchdown against the Miami Dolphins, Flowers set a Ravens franchise record for most receptions (77) and receiving yards (858) by a rookie.[22] In the fourth quarter of the AFC Championship Game against the Kansas City Chiefs, Flowers fumbled at the goal line and the Chiefs recovered the ball in the end zone for a touchback. This occurred after getting a 15-yard taunting penalty earlier in the drive.[23] Flowers finished the game with five receptions for 115 yards and a touchdown as the Ravens lost 10â17.[24] In Week 2 against the Las Vegas Raiders, Flowers had 7 catches for 91 yards and a touchdown in the 26â23 loss.[25] In Week 5 against the Cincinnati Bengals, Flowers led the Ravens with 7 catches for 111 yards in the 41â38 comeback overtime win. It was his first 100-yard game of the season and the second of his career.[26] The following week against the Washington Commanders, Flowers exploded for career-highs of 132 receiving yards on 9 catches, all of them in the first half as the Ravens won 30â23. This marked the first time Flowers has exceeded the 100-yard mark in back-to-back games.[27] In Week 8 against the Cleveland Browns, Flowers recorded his third 100-yard game when he caught 7 passes for 115 yards in the 24â29 upset loss.[28] The following game against the Denver Broncos, Flowers recorded 5 catches for 127 yards and 2 touchdowns including a touchdown that went for 53 yards in the Ravens' 41â10 blowout win.[29] In Week 16 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Flowers had 5 catches for 100 yards as the Ravens would go on to beat the Steelers 34â17.

Flowers also became the first wide receiver to be selected to a Pro Bowl in the Ravens' franchise history.[31]",

Report as Newcastle come from behind to win 2-1 at Spurs for a sixth straight win in all competitions; Dominic Solanke gave Spurs a fourth-minute lead before Anthony Gordon controversially equalised despite a Joelinton handball in the build-up; Alexander Isak scored a 38th-minute winner Saturday 4 January 2025 21:34, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player A controversial Anthony Gordon equaliser followed by Alexander Isak's winner saw Newcastle come from a goal down to beat Tottenham 2-1 for a sixth consecutive victory in all competitions. After Dominic Solanke's fourth-minute opener, Spurs were left fuming with Gordon's sixth-minute leveller after the ball hit Joelinton's hand in the build-up but VAR allowed the goal to stand because \"his arm was by his side, in a natural position and the contact was accidental\". Ex-Premier League referee Mike Dean agreed with the decision on Soccer Saturday as Joelinton's alleged handball \"did not lead directly to a goal\" after the deflection fell to Bruno Guimaraes before Gordon expertly finished past Spurs debutant Brandon Austin. The FA laws stipulate that Newcastle's equaliser would have been ruled out if Joelinton had scored immediately after the ball touched his hand - even though the contact has been deemed accidental. But because it was Gordon that scored after a pass from Guimaraes following the ball striking Joelinton's arm, which was deemed to be in a natural position, the goal was given. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player It meant Eddie Howe's fifth-placed side piled more misery on injury-ravaged Tottenham - who finished the game without a recognised centre-back - to leave Ange Postecoglou's side winless in their last six Premier League home games and in the bottom half of the table in 12th putting them closer to the relegation zone than the top four. New England head coach Thomas Tuchel, attending his first match as Three Lions boss, would have been delighted to see two English players score the first two goals in north London as Solanke headed Spurs into a fourth-minute lead. Tottenham: Austin (7); Porro (7), Dragusin (5), Gray (6), Spence (7); Bergvall (6), Sarr (6); Johnson (6), Kulusevski (6), Werner (5); Solanke (7).

Subs: Barnes (6), Willock (6), Longstaff (6), Kelly (6). Player of the Match: Anthony Gordon. But just 140 seconds later Gordon controversially equalised despite a lengthy VAR check for Joelinton's alleged handball. A furious Postecoglou then saw his side lose their momentum as Newcastle turned up the pressure which eventually told in the 38th minute as Isak maintained his red-hot form with a scrappy close-range finish to score for a seventh consecutive Premier League game.

Despite a patched-up defence, Spurs did push for a second-half equaliser as Brennan Johnson hit the post while substitutes James Maddison and Sergio Reguilon both put efforts wide. But Newcastle held on for a perfect start to 2025 to move a point behind fourth-placed Chelsea and heap more pressure on Postecoglou.

He added: \"Considering everything we had to go through and the situation we're in right now, to put on a performance like that, I take my hat off to the players. I thought they were outstanding. \"I'm just really, really angry, as angry as I've ever been in my career, that they were denied the right rewards for a fantastic performance.\" Asked to clarify whether he was angry at the officiating: \"I know you just want me to say something, but I'm not going to. I think it's clear. Whether people agree with me or not, you think it wasn't handball or it was accidental or whatever, I'm just not interested in any of that discussion. \"What I'm saying is that on any given day, with a fair and even playing field and logical thought processes, we would have won that game. That's it. You can make what you want of that.

It definitely hit Joelinton's arm - I can give you that as well - but I'm not in control of the referee's decision. \"I believe that his arm's down in a natural position. And I think the referee and the VAR have followed the rules and protocols that are in place, so that's why it's given.\" Asked on Postecoglou's comments that Spurs deserved to win: \"I thought we were dominant in the first half today.

Having to contend with a long injury list and an illness which swept through the squad this week, we still produced a display full of character and commitment, with Academy graduate Brandon Austin epitomising the manner of the display with an assured and composed performance in goal on his Spurs debut at the age of 25. This was Austinâs 50th appearance in a Premier League matchday squad and his first competitive game in our colours. We took an early lead through a fine diving header from Dominic Solanke before Newcastle hit back immediately through Anthony Gordon, with Alexander Isak applying the finishing touch to a well-worked move to give the visitors the advantage going into half-time. We were the dominant team throughout most of the second half, Solanke close again with another couple of headers but we just couldnât fashion that one chance to equalise. It was an explosive start to the game with two goals in the opening six minutes to warm everyone up on a freezing afternoon. We took the lead in the fourth minute, Solankeâs diving header from Pedro Porroâs cross beating Martin Dubravka but the visitors responded almost immediately, Gordon with an angled drive past Austin, although what seemed a clear handball from Joelinton in the build-up was cleared by VAR and the goal stood. A superb run from Brennan Johnson led to another chance for us in the 11th minute, the ball breaking for Solanke whose shot was well blocked by Sven Botman, while Austin made a smart save at the other end to keep out another Gordon effort. A big opportunity came the way of the Magpies just after the half-hour mark, Jacob Murphyâs low ball across the six-yard box touched just wide of the far post by Isak with Gordon waiting at the back post to tap home. However they did take the lead on 38 minutes, Murphy again down the right and this time his cross was diverted by Radu Dragusin onto Isak and he side-footed home from close range. The visitors were certainly having the better of the exchanges at that stage but we kept persevering with our football and Timo Werner almost got on the end of the another dangerous Pedro Porro cross as the half drew to a close. With just a one-goal deficit we were always in the game and almost levelled 10 minutes into second half, Dubravka getting down low to save Pape Matar Sarrâs shot with Johnson firing the rebound against the post from a very tight angle. At the other end, Archie Gray blocked Sandro Tonaliâs fierce drive with Gordon blazing the rebound way over the bar. We made a triple change just after the hour with Heung-Min Son, James Maddison and Yves Bissouma on for Werner, Lucas Bergvall and Sarr as we searched for a way back into the game and we certainly had the upper hand for much of the second period. Maddison almost drew us level in the 82nd minute, curling just wide from a short corner before a crazy scramble in the area saw Johnson fizz the ball across the face of goal without it getting a touch before substitute Sergio Reguilon picked it up and drilled back across goal, again nobody on hand to touch it home. With 10 minutes of stoppage time added on, we continued to be the team playing the better football and Solanke was just over the bar with a looping header from Dejan Kulusevskiâs cross, although Austin had to be on guard to push away a shot from Harvey Barnes at the other end. Another Solanke header brought a diving save out of Dubravka as the clock ticked down but that proved to be our last chance of the afternoon.

Start your Independent Premium subscription today. Newcastle United won a fifth consecutive game to pile the misery on Tottenham Hotspur as Eddie Howeâs side came from behind to beat their depleted hosts. Spurs were missing a host of first-time players due to injury or illness but Dominic Solanke gave them an early lead in front of on-looking England manager Thomas Tuchel. But it was quickly cancelled out by Anthony Gordon, much to the fury of Ange Postecoglou after the ball struck off the arm of Newcastle midfielder Joelinton in the build-up. Newcastle took control and Alexander Isak continued his red-hot form as he poked in at the back post to score for the seventh Premier League game in a row and give the visitors a deserved lead. Tottenham improved and were the better team after half-time, as Heung-min Son and James Maddison were called from the bench, but Newcastle held on to climb into fifth place in the Premier League table. Tottenham remain 11th, with just one win from their last eight, but could drop further by the end of the weekend after suffering a 10th league defeat of the season. Follow all the reaction below A fuming Ange Postecoglou said his depleted Tottenham side would have beaten Newcastle had the match taken place on a âan even and fair playing groundâ after the visitors scored a controversial equaliser in their 2-1 win. Postecoglou said he was âproudâ of his teamâs âoutstandingâ efforts but was furious with Newcastleâs equaliser in the first half, which came just two minutes and 20 seconds after Dominic Solankeâs early opener. Tottenham lost possession playing out from defence but the ball struck Newcastle midfielder Joelintonâs hand in the build-up as up Anthony Gordon went on to score. Newcastleâs equaliser came through a Joelinton handball as Postecoglou said his side deserved to win Newcastle came from behind to clinch a fifth straight Premier League win and inflict more pain on Ange Postecoglouâs depleted Tottenham. Spurs, who were without 11 players, went ahead after four minutes through Dominic Solanke but their celebrations were short-lived with Anthony Gordon able to equalise in the sixth minute. There was an element of controversy about the leveller after Joelinton handled in the build-up, but VAR allowed the goal to stand and Eddie Howeâs men claimed all three points thanks to Alexander Isakâs 14th goal of the season before half-time. Tottenham 1-2 Newcastle: Dominic Solanke and Anthony Gordon scored in front of new England boss Thomas Tuchel. Ange Postecoglou, speaking to TNT Sports, says he is âproudâ of his team and believes Tottenham deserved to win the game. âHugely proud of the players. Outstanding considering the situation we are in. We deserved to win that game. All things being equal we would have.â Asked about Newcastleâs first goal, which hit Joelintonâs hand. âI donât feel hard done by. Thatâs the way they want to do things. The last thing I want is an explanation.â Just one Premier League win in eight for Tottenham now since beating Manchester City 4-0 in November. Itâs five points from a possible 24 during that run. They could finish the weekend in 14th, but that would require Manchester United beating Liverpool and West Ham beating Man City. A great game for the neutral and Newcastle showed their steel in the second half. It was reminiscent of their top-four campaign from a couple of years ago where Eddie Howeâs team showed lots of fight and grit at times. How Tottenham could use some of that. They contributed to another entertaining game but thatâs the problem. They were just a bit too easy to play against at times in the first half, which is understandable given their absences. A very good win for Newcastle, who climb up to fifth! Six wins in a row in all competitions and five in the Premier League. 90+10 mins: We go on. One last chance for Spurs to get it long but Livramento wins the challenge with Son. Tonali wins a throw on the far side, in front of the Newcastle fans. 90+9 mins: Newcastle have the ball back in the corner. Guimaraes and Joelinton are loving it. 90+7 mins: SAVE! Another brilliant Porro delivery from the right is met by Solanke. But he canât steer the header either side of Dubravka! 90+5 mins: Another save for Brandon Austin as he stands up to save Harvey Barnesâ flick. Bruno Guimaraes celebrates another Newcastle corner - and I donât think this will come into the box.

Not only has Crunchyroll confirmed it will stream the new episodes, but it also released a compilation movie (Solo Leveling: Reawakening) with a sneak peek of the first two episodes. It ran for two weeks in the US, earning over $3.3 million at the box office, a good result for a production aimed at a niche public. It was also screened in several other countries and territories, including the UK, Canada, and Australia. Now, Season 2 is just a day away. It will debut on Crunchyroll subtitled in several languages in many countries and territories around the world. Solo Leveling Season 2 will premiere on January 4, 2025, at 9:30am PT (12pm ET). If youâre not in the US, no problem â hereâs a list of many other countries: Crunchyroll will stream the series in North America, Central America, South America, Europe, Africa, Oceania, the Middle East, CIS and India. Dubbed versions will be released at a later date. So far, only English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazilian), and Spanish (Latin American and Castilian) dubs are confirmed. Note: Crunchyroll hasnât officially confirmed the time of the debut for all the territories in which the service is available, the times listed here are based on the schedule disclosed in their news section in English. Solo Leveling Season 2 will have 13 episodes, according to the seriesâ page on Netflix, which is rumored to stream the two seasons worldwide from March 2025. However, this may be subject to change. Netflix streams the first season in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, South Korea and Japan. The service will stream the second season in Asian territories, but we couldnât confirm if itâs for all the territories in which Season 1 is available (but it seems likely). If there are no delays during this season, the release schedule should be as follows: In the first season, Sung Jin-Woo has leveled up to A-Rank. The next season will pick up with the Red Gate Arc (Chapters 56-63 of the original novel, and Chapters 46-53 of the webtoon), in which Han Song-Yi, a friend of Sung Jinah (Jin-Wooâs sister), is introduced. Song-Yi is an E-Rank hunter, and Jin-Woo will try to show her how dangerous the hunter path can be. But things go worse than expected inside a Red Gate (those special gates that trap hunters inside them). The main trailer suggests it will also cover the Demonâs Castle, Retesting Rank, Hunterâs Guild Gate and Return to Demonâs Castle arcs (because Jin-woo says âitâs time to get back to clearing the Demonâs Castleâ in the trailer).In the meantime, check out other highly anticipated anime that will release in 2025.

                "title": "Chelsea (given name) - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Chelsea is an English given name derived from the Old English place name Äealc hÈ³Ã°,[1] or the modern Celcyth, meaning chalk landing place. The name evolved to Chelsea, a location on the River Thames that became a London borough known for its wealthy, socially influential residents. Many locations have been named after the English place name Chelsea.[2] The given name, a transferred use of the place name, was in use for boys in the New England region of the United States by the late 18th century and was first used for American girls in the 1840s.[2] The name was first popularized for girls in larger numbers in the United States by American comedian Chelsea Brown, who was born Lois Brown but chose Chelsea as a stage name. After Brown began appearing on the American television program Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In in 1968, the name quadrupled in use for American girls to 48 uses that year. The name debuted among the 1,000 most popular names for American girls in 1969, in 702nd place. Chelsea Morning, a 1969 hit song written about mornings in Chelsea, Manhattan by Canadian singer Joni Mitchell and later performed by Judy Collins, further popularized the name for girls with its descriptive lyrics such as \"the light poured in like butterscotch.\"[2] The name of Chelsea Clinton, daughter of American President Bill Clinton and former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, was inspired by the song when she was born in 1980. The name Chelsea increased further in popularity in the 1980s due to its use for film and television characters, such as Chelsea Thayer Wayne, a character played by Jane Fonda in the 1981 American film On Golden Pond and Chelsea Reardon, a character played by Kassie DePaiva on the American soap opera Guiding Light beginning in 1986. In 1992, the name reached peak popularity in the United States and would have been the eighth most popular name for American girls in that year if all spellings of the name were combined. The name dramatically declined in use in 1993, during the first year of Bill Clinton's presidency. At the time, it was out of fashion in the United States to name children after politicians and those who were associated with them. The name has continued to decline in use, but remained among the 1,000 most popular names for American girls in 2023.[2] Spelling variants in use in the United States include Chelsey, Chelsi, Chelsie, and Chelsy.[2] The name has also been in regular use throughout the Anglosphere, including Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, as well as in Belgium, France and Netherlands.[3]",

The name was used most in 1992, when it was at #15 in the United States on the USA Social Security Administration baby naming chart.[3] The name might come from the Old English language and mean \"chalk landing place\".

                "title": "Lamar Jackson - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Lamar Demeatrice Jackson Jr. (born January 7, 1997) is an American professional football quarterback for the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Louisville Cardinals, winning the Heisman Trophy in 2016, and was selected by the Ravens with the final pick in the first round of the 2018 NFL draft. Intended to serve as a backup in his rookie season, Jackson became the Ravens' starting quarterback after an injury to Joe Flacco. He went on to clinch a division title with the team and became the youngest NFL quarterback to start a playoff game at age 21.[1] Known for his dual-threat playstyle, Jackson led the NFL in touchdown passes in 2019 while setting the single-season record in rushing yards for a quarterback.[2][3][4] For his success, Jackson became the second unanimous NFL Most Valuable Player (MVP)[5][6][7] and the fourth Black quarterback to win the award.[b][8] Jackson followed up his MVP campaign by becoming the first quarterback to have multiple seasons with 1,000 rushing yards and led the Ravens to a third consecutive playoff appearance.[9] In 2023, Jackson led the Ravens to their conference's top seed and was named NFL MVP for the second time en route to the team's first AFC Championship Game since 2012. Jackson is the only quarterback in NFL history with four perfect passer rating games (with at least 15 passing attempts).[10][11] In 2024, he set numerous career highs in passing and became the all-time leader in quarterback rushing yards. Lamar Demeatrice Jackson Jr. was born to Felicia Jones and Lamar Jackson Sr. on January 7, 1997.[12] He grew up in the center of an economically distressed section of Pompano Beach, Florida. Jackson's father died from a heart attack on the same day his grandmother died in 2005, when he was eight years old. Jackson, his younger brother, and two younger sisters were raised by their mother.[13][14][15] Jackson attended public schools and played Pop Warner football in the same Florida league with future teammate Marquise Brown.[16][15] When he was eight years old, Jackson could throw a football 20 yards.[15] At age 11 Jackson won the South Florida FYFL Super Bowl. Jackson, his brother Jamar and the Northwest Broward Raiders beat the Fort Lauderdale Hurricanes, who had been back-to-back champions with a long winning streak. Jackson was the starting quarterback for the Raiders; but he was also the team's safety and place kicker. The Raiders won 14â6 as Jackson threw two touchdowns and kicked the extra points.[17][18] Jackson started his high school football career relatively late, not being on a team until his junior year of high school.[19] Jackson attended Santaluces for his first two years of high school, before transferring to Boynton Beach High School in Boynton Beach, Florida.[19][20] While there, Jackson was a successful read-option quarterback who could run and throw the ball equally well. He improved passing accuracy and decision-making by watching hours of film each week.[21] In two years at Boynton Beach, Jackson threw for 2,263 yards and 31 touchdowns with nine interceptions. He also ran for 1,624 yards and 22 touchdowns, and had a quarterback rating of 102.7.[22] A touchdown highlight Jackson scored against Village Academy went viral online,[23] with The Palm Beach Post's Ryan DiPentima detailing: Without any passing options down field, the dynamic QB rolled to his right, pump faked at the line of scrimmage and then took off for the end zone. He pointed at a Village Academy defender while beating him to the edge and then cut up field. Then, as another defender came flying in to make a tackle at the goal line, he hit the breaks [sic]. He just ... stopped. As the defender flew by him, Jackson strutted into the end zone and threw his hands up.[19] Jackson's last high school game came against a nationally ranked Miami Central High School team during the first round of the 2014 Florida High School Football Playoff 6A tournament. Boynton Beach was soundly defeated 49â6, with Jackson throwing two interceptions.[24] He also competed for his high school track team, posting a personal record of 11.45 seconds in the 100 meter dash in one track meet.[25] Jackson was named the Lou Groza Palm Beach County High School Player of the Year in 2014.[26] Jackson was rated three stars by ESPN.com and 247Sports, but four stars by Rivals.com.[27] Despite the disagreement by recruiting companies over his caliber, he received offers from both Power Five schools like Louisville, Florida, Auburn, and Clemson, and mid-major programs like Akron, Western Kentucky, and Marshall.[28] All of the major recruiting companies listed Jackson as a top 20 dual-threat quarterback, with 247Sports ranking him as high as #12.[29] Jackson's in-state ranking also varied greatly, from as high as #51 from Rivals to as low as #80 by ESPN. Jackson visited only four schools (Louisville, Florida, Nebraska, and Mississippi State), and, after it appeared he might sign with Florida, Jackson ultimately committed to the University of Louisville. Head coach Bobby Petrino promised Jackson's mother that her son would be playing quarterback and nothing else.[14][30][31] Sources: As a freshman at Louisville in 2015 (he was a communications major[32]), Jackson played in 12 games and made eight starts in the Cardinals' 8â5 season.[33] One of those starts was Louisville's first game of the season against #6 Auburn. On the first play of the game, Jackson threw an interception[34][35] and Louisville ultimately lost that game 31â24 with Jackson rushing for 106 yards. During the season, he completed 135-of-247 passes for 1,840 yards with 12 touchdowns and eight interceptions and ran for 960 yards and 11 rushing touchdowns.[36][37] Jackson was named the MVP of the 2015 Music City Bowl after passing for 227 yards with two touchdowns and rushing for a Music City Bowl-record 226 yards and two touchdowns.[38][39] During the first game of his sophomore year, against the Charlotte 49ers, Jackson set a university record for total touchdowns with eight, all of them in the first half.[40] Against Syracuse, Jackson completed 20 of 39 passes for 411 yards, a touchdown, and an interception to go along with 199 rushing yards and four touchdowns, with all five touchdowns coming in the first half as the Cardinals routed the Orange 62â28.[41] One of those touchdowns came when he hurdled over a Syracuse defender into the end zone.[42] Against #2 Florida State, Jackson completed 13-of-20 passes for 216 yards, a touchdown, and an interception in addition to 146 rushing yards and four touchdowns. He scored four of the five total touchdowns in the first half in a 63â20 rout of the Seminoles, the most points that the Seminoles had ever surrendered at the time.[42] The game made Jackson the Heisman front runner,[43] and gave the Cardinals a #3 ranking, their highest since 2006.[44][45] Against Marshall, Jackson completed 24 of 44 passes for 417 yards and five touchdowns, and had 62 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns.[46] Against #5 Clemson, Louisville's offense totaled 586 yards, with Jackson accounting for 295 passing yards, 162 rushing yards, and three total touchdowns (one passing, two rushing). The Cardinals eventually lost the game 42â36.[47] On December 8, Jackson was awarded the Walter Camp Award as the player of the year and the Maxwell Award as the best all-around player in college football.[48] On December 10, 2016, Jackson was selected as the 2016 Heisman Trophy winner over fellow finalists Deshaun Watson, Dede Westbrook, Jabrill Peppers, and Baker Mayfield.[49] Jackson became Louisville's first Heisman Trophy winner in school history, and the youngest-ever recipient of the award at the age of 19 years and 337 days.[50][51][52] He finished Louisville's 9â4 season with 3,543 passing yards, 30 passing touchdowns, and nine interceptions to go along with 260 carries for 1,571 rushing yards and 21 touchdowns.[53][54] Aside from nationally recognized awards, Jackson also won prestigious awards within the University of Louisville. In 2017, he won a Louie for being named the Adidas High Performance Male Athlete of the Year for his outstanding sophomore campaign. Jackson also won a Louie for Play of the Year after the leap he made in the 2016 Syracuse game.[55] When Jackson entered the 2017 season, his fan base and media had high expectations of his performance. College GameDay announced their return to the University of Louisville to host the opening matchup on September 16 between the returning National Champions, Clemson Tigers, and the Cardinals. Despite the 47â21 blowout the Tigers achieved,[56] Jackson did not let the numbers affect his playing ability. His remarkable statistics for the season resulted in Jackson being a Heisman finalist for the 2017 season. He finished in third place in the Heisman voting, losing out to Baker Mayfield and Bryce Love.[57] Jackson played in 13 games, finishing with 3,660 passing yards for 27 touchdowns and 10 interceptions to go along with 232 carries for 1,601 rushing yards and 18 touchdowns in the Cardinals' 8â5 season.[58][59][60] Following the 2017â18 school year, Jackson was named the men's ACC Athlete of the Year for all conference sports, sharing honors with women's winner Arike Ogunbowale of Notre Dame basketball.[61] On January 5, 2018, Jackson announced that he would enter the 2018 NFL draft.[62] Many draft pundits doubted Jackson's quarterback abilities and suggested that he switch positions to wide receiver due to his athleticism, but Jackson remained adamant about his intention to play quarterback professionally. Jackson declined to run drills such as the 40-yard dash during the NFL Scouting Combine, in order to focus on displaying his passing skills.[63] Jackson reportedly clocked in a 4.34 40 yard dash time in 2017 at Louisville.[64] Jackson was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the first round with the 32nd overall pick in the draft, after trading up for the selection with the Philadelphia Eagles.[67][68] He was the fifth quarterback selected that year.[69] On June 5, 2018, Jackson signed his rookie contract, reportedly worth $9.47 million with a $4.97 million signing bonus.[70] Jackson made his NFL debut relieving starting quarterback Joe Flacco in the second half of the season-opening 47â3 victory over the Buffalo Bills, finishing with 24 passing yards and 39 rushing yards.[71] During a narrow Week 7 24â23 loss to the New Orleans Saints, Jackson scored his first NFL touchdown on a one-yard rush.[72] In the next game against the Carolina Panthers, Jackson completed four of five passes for 46 yards and his first NFL touchdown, a 26-yard completion to fellow rookie tight end Hayden Hurst, in relief of Flacco during the fourth quarter of a 36â21 loss.[73] During a Week 11 24â21 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals, Jackson made his first NFL start in place of the injured Joe Flacco, who injured his hip two weeks prior against the Pittsburgh Steelers.[74] Jackson completed 13-of-19 passes for 150 yards and an interception and rushed for 117 yards, which was a Ravens franchise record for rushing yards by a quarterback in a single game.[75] In the next game against the Oakland Raiders, he threw for 178 yards, a touchdown, and two interceptions while also rushing for 71 yards and a touchdown as the Ravens won by a score of 34â17.[76] The following week against the Atlanta Falcons, Jackson passed for 125 yards and rushed for 75 yards and a touchdown in a 26â16 road victory.[77] During a Week 14 24â27 overtime road loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, Jackson had his first two-touchdown game as he threw for 147 yards and two touchdowns while also rushing for 67 yards.[78] Two weeks later, Jackson helped the Ravens defeat the Los Angeles Chargers, completing 12 of 22 passes for 204 yards and a touchdown in a 22â10 upset victory.[79] In the regular-season finale against fellow rookie quarterback Baker Mayfield and the Cleveland Browns, Jackson passed for 179 yards and rushed for 90 yards and two touchdowns, despite fumbling a third potential touchdown at the goal line, as the Ravens narrowly beat the Browns 26â24 to clinch the AFC North title.[80] In the seven regular season games in which Jackson had started, the Ravens went 6â1 to close out the 2018 season.[81] Overall, he finished the season with 1,201 passing yards, six passing touchdowns, and three interceptions.[82] Jackson also led all quarterbacks with 695 rushing yards and added five rushing touchdowns.[83] Taking the field on the day before his 22nd birthday, Jackson became the youngest quarterback to start an NFL playoff game in a Wild Card rematch against the Los Angeles Chargers. Despite being held to just 25 passing yards at one point in the fourth quarter by a stout Chargers defense, Jackson then passed for two touchdowns in four minutes to bring the Ravens back from a 20-point deficit to within a touchdown. After forcing the Chargers to punt with less than a minute left, the Ravens had one last chance to win the game down six points, but Jackson was strip-sacked by Chargers linebacker Uchenna Nwosu. With the Chargers recovering the ball, the Ravens lost 23â17 and were knocked out of the playoffs. Jackson finished the game completing 14 of 29 passes for 194 yards, the two aforementioned touchdowns, and an interception while rushing for 54 yards and losing a fumble.[84][85] Once the 2018 season ended, the Ravens' coaching staff decided to abandon the offensive strategy that had been designed for Joe Flacco and create a new offensive philosophy centered around the specific skills of Jackson.

He would receive $52 million per year, making him the highest-paid player in NFL history just 10 days after Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts set the record (although Jackson's record contract would be surpassed by Justin Herbert just months later).[177] The deal also included a $72.5 million signing bonus, surpassing Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott's 2021 deal for the biggest signing bonus in NFL history.[178] On September 17, 2023, Jackson and the Ravens faced off against the previous season's AFC North champion Cincinnati Bengals.

He also did so in just 82 career games, the fewest for a quarterback in NFL history, surpassing Michael Vick's previous record of doing so in 104 career games.[181] During a Week 16 33â19 road victory over the top-seeded San Francisco 49ers on Christmas Day, Jackson threw for 252 yards, two touchdowns, and no interceptions for a 105.9 passer rating while also leading Baltimore with 45 rushing yards.[182] In the next game against the Miami Dolphins, Jackson was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week[183] after posting a perfect passer rating for the third time in his career, completing 18 of 21 passes for 321 yards, five touchdowns, and no interceptions during a 56â19 victory.[184] The win also clinched the top-seed in the AFC and the AFC North championship for the first time since 2019.[185] On January 3, 2024, the Ravens announced that Jackson would be inactive for the final game of the regular season. He finished the regular season with career highs in pass completions, completion percentage, and passing yards.[186] Jackson won his second NFL MVP in a near-unanimous decision, receiving 49 of 50 first-place votes.

In Week 17 on Christmas Day against the Houston Texans, Jackson surpassed Michael Vick as the NFL's all time leading rusher at quarterback in the 31-2 victory. Jackson has been widely regarded as the best running quarterback in the NFL since his rookie season.[202] His dual-threat playstyle has often earned him comparisons players such as Randall Cunningham and Michael Vick.[203] Except for his rookie season, the Ravens have led the league in rushing each year with Jackson under center.[204] In 2019, the Ravens broke the single-season rushing record,[204] with Jackson breaking Vick's record for most rushing yards by a quarterback in a single season.[205][206] In 2024, his seventh season, Jackson broke Vick's record for most rushing yards by a quarterback in a career.[207] However, concerns have been raised on Jackson's ability to play as a pure pocket passer when the run game is contained.[208] These concerns about Jackson's passing began during his college tenure with Louisville.[63][209] Over the years, most analysts have cited improvement in Jackson's passing ability.[210][211][206] During Week 9 of the 2024 season, in a 41â10 victory over the Denver Broncos, Jackson recorded the fourth perfect passer rating of his career.[212] Jackson is tied for the most in NFL history.[213] Prior to the start of the 2019 NFL season, Jackson appeared on ABC's Celebrity Family Feud, pitting current NFL players against former NFL players.[267][268] During the 2019 NFL season, Jackson's Madden NFL character speed was upgraded to 96, making Jackson the fastest quarterback in that game's history.[269][270] Jackson was the cover athlete in the Madden NFL 21 video game.[271] In 2019, Pope Francis was gifted a signed Lamar Jackson Ravens jersey.[272] In February 2020, BET Digital highlighted Jackson as one of 40 of the most inspiring and innovative vanguards in African American culture and who are redefining what it means to be \"unapologetically young, gifted & Black\".[273] In 2018, Jackson announced the launch of his sportswear line, Era 8 Apparel.[274][275] In March 2020, he filed a federal lawsuit against Amazon, charging the corporate giant with engaging in the \"deliberate and unauthorized use\" of Jackson's name, image and persona. The suit also alleges that Amazon had unlawfully infringed on his right of publicity in connection with alleged \"false advertising and endorsement of unlicensed and infringing articles of clothing.\"[276] In August 2020, Jackson signed an endorsement deal with Oakley, Inc., a company that produces sunglasses, sports goggles and football helmet visors.[277] In May 2022, it was announced that Jackson had entered the restaurant business with the purchase of a soul food restaurant in his home state of Florida. Tasty's Soul Food Sports Bar & Grill in Pompano Beach will change its name to Play Action Soulfood and More.[278] In September 2022, Jackson posted on his Twitter that he would be the cover star of NFL's first virtual reality (VR) game.[279] \"NFL Pro Era\" is the first VR NFL game is said to let users 'experience what it's like to compete as the QB of their favorite NFL team.'

                "content": "By Emilio Abad January 04, 2025 06:29PM EDT January 04, 2025 06:29PM EDT By Emilio Abad In Saturdayâs showdown between the Baltimore Ravens and Cleveland Browns, Lamar Jackson delivered yet another MVP-caliber performance, further solidifying his case as the leagueâs most valuable player this season. Jacksonâs versatility was on full display, highlighted by a remarkable NFL milestone that underscores his unique skill setâone rarely seen in the league. Jackson became the first quarterback in NFL history to finish a season with over 4,000 passing yards and 800 rushing yards. In addition, he now holds the record for the most career rushing yards by a quarterback, with 6,154. Head coach John Harbaugh praised Jackson before Week 18, calling him the MVP front-runner, and statistically, this season is shaping up to be even better than Jacksonâs 2023-2024 MVP campaign. However, the Ravensâ current record doesnât reflect the same dominance, which could impact his MVP candidacy despite the numbers. With this win, the Ravens are in position to lock up the AFC North. Securing the division title would allow them to host a playoff game, providing a clearer path to their ultimate goal: a Super Bowl appearance and victory. This season, three quarterbacks stand out as MVP candidates, each delivering career-best performances. All three have achieved feats that would have likely earned them the MVP award in previous years. However, two of these quarterbacksâLamar Jackson and Josh Allenâhave shattered records that make their cases especially compelling. Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen. Both Jackson and Allen have accomplished something unprecedented in NFL history: more than 3,500 passing yards, over 500 rushing yards, 40 or more total touchdowns, and fewer than 10 turnovers in a single season. These extraordinary achievements make them the clear front-runners for the leagueâs most prestigious individual award. see also NFL imposes strong fine on Chiefs star Travis Kelce for controversial action in game vs Steelers Josh Allen has been the engine of the Buffalo Billsâ offense, accounting for 93% of the teamâs offensive production. He has also generated 80% of the Billsâ total yards, a staggering figure, especially considering the lack of support from a standout running back. No Bills RB has surpassed 1,000 rushing yards this season. Allen has also made significant strides in ball security, a criticism in past seasons. Heâs thrown six interceptions compared to Jacksonâs four, but when factoring in lost fumbles, Allen has just seven turnovers to Jacksonâs nine. Lamar Jacksonâs efficiency and explosiveness remain unmatched. Despite accounting for 77.4% of the Ravensâ offensive productionâa lower percentage than AllenâJackson has benefited from a more balanced supporting cast. Baltimore boasts eight Pro Bowlers this season, compared to just one for Buffalo. Additionally, Jackson has Derrick Henry in the backfield, who nearly hit 2,000 rushing yards, relieving some of the defensive focus on the Ravensâ quarterback. While Jacksonâs individual brilliance stands out, the context surrounding Josh Allenâs success strengthens his MVP case. The Bills have overcome significant challenges, including salary cap constraints that limited roster depth. Buffalo wasnât expected to contend for a top seed, yet theyâve secured the AFCâs No. 2 spot, largely thanks to Allenâs heroic efforts. Conversely, the Ravens, a preseason favorite to secure the AFCâs top seed, have fallen short of expectations despite Jacksonâs historic season. see also Former Super Bowl Champion with Patriots Bill Belichick, makes bold confession about Ex-Giants Eli Manning Ultimately, the MVP race between Allen and Jackson highlights two contrasting narratives: Allenâs resilience in adversity versus Jacksonâs unparalleled efficiency and explosiveness. Both have redefined what it means to be a dual-threat quarterback, and the award will likely come down to how voters weigh team context versus individual brilliance.

                "content": "Editions: En/nfl/baltimore-ravens The Ravens star shares a candid story about his high school setbacks and how he turned adversity into NFL triumph. Lamar Jackson, known for his explosive talent and record-breaking performances, recently shared a candid story about the challenges he faced before becoming the Baltimore Ravens' star quarterback. Speaking on the Essence YouTube channel, Jackson opened up about his high school years, revealing how poor grades once sidelined his football dreams and forced him to confront a grueling mental battle. During his sophomore year, Jackson's grades were so low that he was benched for an entire season. The setback could have derailed his ambitions, but instead, it became a turning point. \"Some people hate it because they can't understand how someone can push through and succeed. They don't see the grind,\" Jackson said. Reflecting on his year off, he explained that the time away from the game fueled his determination to give football his all. \"I didn't play in 10th grade because I was just being a kid. But that year taught me what hard work really means,\" he added. Related: While Jackson managed to return to the field without attending Junior College (JUCO), he expressed deep admiration for NFL players who took that route. He acknowledged the struggles JUCO athletes endure and praised their resilience in balancing academics and sports. One notable player who shares a similar story is Tyreek Hill of the Miami Dolphins. Hill, like Jackson, struggled with academics in high school and attended Garden City Community College, initially for track and field. It wasn't until his JUCO years that Hill discovered his passion for football, eventually earning the nickname \"Cheetah\" in the NFL. Jackson and Hill's journeys serve as powerful reminders that success often comes through perseverance. Balancing sports and academics can be overwhelming, but as Jackson put it, \"It's about the grind.\" Their stories inspire athletes everywhere to stay focused, work hard, and never lose sight of their goals. Both players' paths highlight the importance of mental toughness alongside physical talent. For anyone facing setbacks, their examples show that even the toughest challenges can lead to greatness.

                "content": "Our editors will review what youâve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Lamar Jackson (born January 7, 1997, Pompano Beach, Florida, U.S.) is an American professional gridiron football player who is among the best dual-threat (rushing and passing) quarterbacks in National Football League (NFL) history. As a sophomore at the University of Louisville, he won the Heisman Trophy as college footballâs top player, and in his second season (2019) playing for the Baltimore Ravens, he became the second unanimous winner of the NFL Most Valuable Player (MVP) award. Jackson was also named MVP of the 2023 season. In 2005, when Jackson was eight years old, his father died on the same day as one of his grandmothers, leaving his mother to raise their four children on her own. Jackson attended Santaluces Community High School in Lantana, Florida, for ninth and tenth grade and played sparingly for the football team. He transferred to Boynton Beach Community High School in Boynton Beach, Florida, in the spring of 2013 and quickly became the football teamâs starting quarterback. Over the course of his junior and senior seasons, Jackson threw for more than 2,200 yards with 31 touchdowns and rushed for more than 1,600 yards with 22 touchdowns. Coming out of high school, Jackson was recruited by a number of colleges, including major football programs such as Auburn University, the Ohio State University, and Florida State University. Instead, he committed to the less-prestigious Louisville, whose coach, Bobby Petrino, promised Jackson that he would play quarterback and no other position. In his freshman year Jackson threw for 1,840 yards, 12 touchdowns, and 8 interceptions while rushing for 960 yards and 11 touchdowns, leading the Cardinals to an 8â5 record. He then led Louisville to a 27â21 victory over Texas A&M University in the Music City Bowl and was named the gameâs MVP. Jacksonâs sophomore campaign at Louisville vaulted him into college football history. He threw for 3,543 yards and 30 touchdowns with only 9 interceptions and rushed for 1,571 yards with 21 touchdowns and became the first player from Louisville to win the Heisman Trophy. The Cardinals posted a 9â4 record that season and ended it ranked 21st in the Associated Press poll. The following season, Jacksonâs junior year, the Cardinals backslid slightly, finishing with a record of 8â5, though Jackson continued his electrifying play. In 2017 he threw for 3,660 yards and 27 touchdowns and rushed for 1,601 yards and 18 touchdowns, finishing third in Heisman voting. After the seasonâs conclusion, he announced that he would forgo his fourth year of eligibility and enter his name into the 2018 NFL draft. In the draft, Jackson was selected as the 32nd overall pick by the Baltimore Ravens. Because of his athletic ability, some teams, such as the Los Angeles Chargers, had inquired before the draft about Jacksonâs willingness to play wide receiver. He quickly shut down any speculation that he would switch positions and was chosen by the Ravens with the intent that he eventually would inherit the teamâs starting quarterback role. Jackson spent the beginning of his rookie season as the backup quarterback to Joe Flacco. After Flacco injured his hip in November 2018, Jackson started his first NFL game, throwing for 150 yards and rushing for 119 yards in a win over the Cincinnati Bengals. He led the Ravens through the rest of the 2018 season, securing a berth in the playoffs, where they lost to the Chargers in the wild-card round. Jacksonâs next year proved to be the best of his career, as he tore through opposing defenses with a combination of accurate passing and explosive running. In total, accounting for both rushing and passing, Jackson accrued 3,127 yards and 43 touchdowns that year as the Ravens ended the season with a league-best 14â2 record. They were upset in the divisional round of the playoffs by the Tennessee Titans. Nevertheless, Jackson won the NFL MVP in a unanimous vote, to go alongside a selection to the Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro honors. In 2020 Jackson continued to play well, passing for 2,757 yards and 26 touchdowns while leading the Ravens to an 11â5 record. In the final game of the season against the Cincinnati Bengals, he surpassed 1,000 yards rushing for the second year in a row, becoming the first NFL quarterback to reach that mark more than once. (Jackson finished the year with 1,005 yards rushing and seven rushing touchdowns.) The Ravens made the playoffs, defeating the Titans in the wild-card game before falling to the Buffalo Bills in the divisional round. Jackson had another strong season in 2021, totaling 3,649 yards and 18 touchdowns through the air and on the ground. Despite injuring his ankle in Week 14 and missing the remainder of the season, he was chosen for the Pro Bowl. In 2022 Jackson had another hot start but was ultimately sidelined in Week 13, this time with an injury to a knee ligament, and he missed the Ravensâ playoff game (a loss to the Bengals). During a prolonged and bitter contract dispute during the following off-season, Jackson requested a trade from the Ravens. In late April 2023, however, Jackson and the Ravens agreed to a five-year, $260 million contract, making him at the time the highest-paid player in NFL history, with an average annual salary of $52 million. Jackson went on to have a stellar 2023 seasonâhe was named MVP for the second timeâand backed by his strong play, the Ravens posted a 13â4 record and easily advanced to the AFC championship game. However, there the team was defeated by the Kansas City Chiefs.",

                "content": "Derrick Lamar Henry Jr.[1][2] (born January 4, 1994)[1] is an American professional football running back for the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League (NFL). Nicknamed \"King Henry\",[3][4] he is known for his imposing style of play and larger build than the average running back. Born and raised in Yulee, Florida, Henry set the national high school football record for career rushing yards with the Yulee Hornets. He played college football for the Alabama Crimson Tide, where during his junior season, he broke Herschel Walker's single-season college rushing yards record in the Southeastern Conference (SEC), won the 2015 Heisman Trophy, the Doak Walker Award, the Maxwell Award, and the Walter Camp Award, and was a key part of the 2015 Alabama Crimson Tide football team that won the 2016 College Football Playoff National Championship. Henry was selected by the Tennessee Titans in the second round of the 2016 NFL draft, where he was a four-time Pro Bowl selection. A backup for most of his first two seasons in the league, Henry emerged as the Titans' feature back near the end of the 2018 season. He led the NFL in rushing yards for the 2019 season, as well as rushing touchdowns (tied with Green Bay Packers running back Aaron Jones). In 2020, Henry again led the league in rushing yards and touchdowns and became the eighth player in NFL history to rush for over 2,000 yards in a single season, and the second Tennessee Titan to do so, after Chris Johnson achieved it in 2009. Henry won the 2020 Associated Press NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award. After missing more than half of the 2021 season to injury, he made his third and fourth Pro Bowl appearances in the subsequent two seasons. After eight seasons with Tennessee, Henry signed with the Ravens in 2024. Derrick Lamar Henry Jr. was born in Yulee, Florida, to Stacy Veal and Derrick Henry Sr., aged 15 and 16 respectively.[5] Henry's father was absent for much of his childhood, having been arrested 20 times for various crimes including drug and prostitution-related offenses, and was consequently in and out of prison and had trouble maintaining employment. His mother became a hemodialysis technician. Henry was raised primarily by his grandmother, Gladys, who nicknamed him \"Shocka\", as his birth shocked the whole family, given his parents' young ages. He developed a close relationship to his grandmother, whom he cites as very influential in his upbringing.[6][7] Henry attended Yulee High School, where he was a three-sport star in football, basketball, and track. He played as a running back for the Yulee Hornets football team.[8] He ran for 2,465 yards and 26 touchdowns as a freshman in 2009. He was named a first-team All-Coast selection at running back in 2010 after rushing for 2,788 yards and 38 touchdowns while averaging 8.9 yards per attempt. He rushed for 2,610 yards and 34 scores as a junior in 2011 to earn first-team All-Coast honors from the Florida Times-Union. He set the Florida high school record with a 510-yard performance against Jacksonville Jackson (a record he held until 2021[9]) and averaged 9.2 yards per carry and 327.8 yards per game as a senior, finishing the season with a state-record 4,261 yards and 55 touchdowns.[10] He finished his high school football career with 12,124 career rushing yards, which broke Ken Hall's career record.[11][12] During this time, Henry began receiving the nickname \"King Henry\" by stadium crowds and local television news reports as he began aiming to break the national high school rushing title.[13] He also rushed for 153 career touchdowns. His career touchdown totals rank fifth all-time. In four years at Yulee he averaged more than 250 yards a game and never rushed for fewer than 100 yards in a game.[14] He played for the East squad in the 2013 U.S. Army All-American Bowl, where he rushed for 53 yards with a touchdown and a two-point conversion.[15][16] As a track & field athlete, Henry competed as a sprinter at Yulee from 2010 to 2011. He posted a personal-best time of 11.11 seconds in the 100-meter dash at the 2011 FHSAA 2A District 3 Championships, where he placed seventh.[17] He was also a member of the 4Ã100 and 4Ã400 squads.[18] Considered a five-star recruit by ESPN.com, Henry was listed as the No. 1 athlete (player with no designated position) in the nation in 2013.[19] After originally committing to the University of Georgia, Henry committed to the University of Alabama on September 28, 2012.[20] He held offers from many of the top college football programs in the country, including USC, Notre Dame, Tennessee, Florida, and Clemson.[21] His number was eventually retired by Yulee.[22] Henry attended and played college football for the University of Alabama from 2013 to 2015 under head coach Nick Saban.[23][24] He majored in communication. He graduated on May 4, 2018.[25] That same day, he published an article in The Players' Tribune thanking his late grandmother for the inspiration to continue pursuing his degree.[25][26] As a true freshman in 2013, Henry rushed for 382 yards on 36 carries with three touchdowns in a backfield largely dominated by T. J. Yeldon and Kenyan Drake.[27][28] On October 19, against Arkansas, he had 111 rushing yards and his first collegiate rushing touchdown in the 52â0 victory.[29] During the 2014 Sugar Bowl, he rushed for 100 yards and a touchdown on eight carries and had a 61-yard touchdown reception in the 45â31 loss to the Oklahoma Sooners.[30][31] In that game, Spanish-language broadcaster Pablo Viruega on ESPN Deportes nicknamed him \"El Tractorcito\" (The Little Tractor) due to his long stride and powerful gait. The nickname became a popular internet meme.[32] In the 2014 season, Henry and Yeldon split a majority of the work in the backfield.[33] In the season opener against West Virginia, he had 113 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown in the 33â23 victory in the Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game.[34] On September 20, against Florida, he had 111 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown in the 42â21 victory.[35] On October 18 against Texas A&M, he had 70 rushing yards, one rushing touchdown, and a 41-yard receiving touchdown in the 59â0 victory.[36] On November 22, against Western Carolina, he had 92 rushing yards, two rushing touchdowns, and a nine-yard receiving touchdown in the 48â14 victory.[37] In the annual rivalry game against Auburn, he had 72 rushing yards and a touchdown in the high-scoring 55â44 installment of the rivalry.[38] In the SEC Championship against Missouri, he had 141 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in the 42â13 victory.[39] Alabama qualified for the College Football Playoff and faced off against Ohio State in the National Semifinals in the Sugar Bowl.[40] Henry had 95 rushing yards, one rushing touchdown, and two receptions for 54 yards as Alabama fell 42â35 to the Buckeyes.[41] In his sophomore year, Henry rushed for 990 yards on 172 carries with 11 touchdowns.[42] After Yeldon left for the NFL, Henry took over as the starting running back as a junior in 2015. In the season opener against Wisconsin, he had 147 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns in the 35â17 victory.[43] In the next game, against Middle Tennessee State, he had 96 rushing yards and another game with three rushing touchdowns in the 37â10 victory.[44] In the next game against Ole Miss, he had 127 rushing yards, one rushing touchdown, and five receptions for 39 yards in Alabama's only loss of the season, a 43â37 decision.[45] After rushing for 52 yards against LouisianaâMonroe, he had 148 rushing yards and a touchdown in a 38â10 victory over previously undefeated Georgia.[46][47] On October 10, he rushed for 95 yards and a touchdown against Arkansas in a 27â14 victory.[48] After the victory over the Razorbacks, he went on an impressive stretch of performances. On October 17, against Texas A&M, he had 236 rushing yards, two rushing touchdowns, and an 18-yard reception in a 41â23 victory.[49] In the next game, a narrow 19â14 victory over Tennessee, he had 143 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns.[50] In the following game, a much-anticipated matchup with fellow Heisman contender Leonard Fournette of LSU, he had 210 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns in the 30â16 victory over the previously undefeated team.[51][52] In the next game, against Mississippi State, he had 204 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in the 31â6 victory.[53] In the next game, against Charleston Southern, he had 68 rushing yards and two more rushing touchdowns in a limited role in the 56â6 victory.[54] In the Iron Bowl against Auburn, he had 271 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown on 46 carries in the 29â13 victory.[55] In the SEC Championship against Florida, he had 44 carries for 189 yards and a touchdown in the 29â15 victory.[56] Alabama qualified for the College Football Playoff and faced off against Michigan State in the National Semifinals.[57] In the 38â0 victory over the Spartans in the Cotton Bowl, he had 75 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns.[58] During Alabama's 45â40 victory over Clemson in the 2016 College Football Playoff National Championship, he rushed for 158 yards on 36 carries with three touchdowns.[59] During the game, he also broke Shaun Alexander's record for most career rushing yards in Alabama history.[60] Playing in all 15 games, he rushed for SEC records 2,219 yards and 28 touchdowns on 395 carries. In addition, he scored at least one touchdown in each game.[61][62][63] He led the NCAA in rushing attempts, rushing yards, rushing touchdowns, and points scored.[64] Henry won the Heisman Trophy, beating out finalists Christian McCaffrey and Deshaun Watson.[65] He won numerous other awards including the Doak Walker Award, Walter Camp Award, and Maxwell Award.[66] Henry declared for the 2016 NFL Draft after his junior season.[25] Coming out of Alabama, Henry was projected by the majority of analysts to be either drafted in the late first or second round. Scouts regarded his main assets to be his large frame, violent running, ability to break tackles with ease, speed, long strides, superior conditioning, and consistent play. The main concerns were about the wear and tear his body took as a workhorse at Alabama, his slow acceleration, average foot quickness, below-average catching ability, narrow based running style, sluggish cutbacks, and running tall.[67] Henry was drafted by the Tennessee Titans in the second round (45th overall) of the 2016 NFL draft.[70] He was the second running back taken that year, after #4 Ezekiel Elliott.[71] He was reunited with his former fullback at Alabama Jalston Fowler.[72] On May 9, 2016, the Titans signed Henry to a four-year, $5.40 million contract with $3.30 million guaranteed and a signing bonus of $2.13 million.[73] Henry began his rookie season as the backup running back to veteran DeMarco Murray. He wore the No. 2 jersey throughout training camp and preseason and donned the No. 22 once running back Dexter McCluster was cut on September 2, 2016.[74] Henry made his NFL debut and earned his first NFL start in the Titans' season-opening loss to the Minnesota Vikings. He finished the game with five carries for three yards and two receptions for 41 yards.[75] During Week 8, Henry scored his first NFL touchdown on a 6-yard rush in a 36â22 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars. He finished the game with 16 carries for a then career-high 60 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown and four catches for 37 yards.[76] On December 18, 2016, he had nine rushing attempts for 58 rushing yards and a season-high two rushing touchdowns in a 19â17 road victory over the Kansas City Chiefs.[77] During the season finale against the Houston Texans, he ran for a then-career-high 65 rushing yards on 15 carries and scored a touchdown in the 24â17 victory.[78] Henry finished his rookie season with 110 carries for 490 yards (both sixth among NFL rookies in 2016) and five touchdowns in 15 games and two starts.[79] He also caught 13 passes for 137 yards.[80] For most of the 2017 season, Henry split carries with DeMarco Murray and run-oriented quarterback Marcus Mariota. During Week 2, Henry ran for 92 yards and a touchdown on 14 carries in a 37â16 road victory against the Jaguars.[81] On October 16, 2017, on Monday Night Football, Henry ran for a then career-best 131 yards on 19 carries, including a 72-yard touchdown late in the fourth quarter of the 36â22 victory over the Indianapolis Colts. In addition, he had a 14-yard reception in the victory.[82] During Week 13, Henry ran for 109 yards on 11 carries and beat his longest rush of the year with a 75-yard rushing touchdown late in the fourth quarter of the 24â13 victory over the Texans.[83] In the regular season finale against the Jaguars, Henry caught his first receiving touchdown on a 66-yard reception from Marcus Mariota in the 15â10 victory.[84] The Titans finished second in the AFC South with a 9â7 record and made the playoffs as a Wild Card team.[85][86] In the Wild Card Round, the Titans played the Chiefs. Because DeMarco Murray was out with a knee injury, Henry got the start.[87] In a 22â21 road victory, Henry had the best performance of his career up to that point, rushing for 156 yards and a touchdown on 23 carries and catching two passes for 35 yards.[88] His 191 yards-from-scrimmage was a franchise record. In the Divisional Round against the New England Patriots, Henry had 28 rushing yards and 21 receiving yards in the 35â14 road loss.[89] Henry finished the regular season with 176 carries for 744 rushing yards and five touchdowns in 15 games and two starts. He also caught 11 passes for 136 yards and a touchdown. In the postseason, Henry ran for 184 yards and a touchdown on 35 carries and caught five passes for 56 yards.[90] During the 2018 offseason, Matt LaFleur was hired as the Titans' new offensive coordinator and the team also acquired running back Dion Lewis.[91] Lewis's pass-catching ability was seen as a fit for LaFleur's offensive scheme, which often employed running backs to catch passes out of the backfield, and leading to success with Todd Gurley in the previous season as offensive coordinator with the Rams.[92] This led to speculation that LaFleur would favor Lewis over Henry.[93] Henry ended up splitting carries with Lewis and run-oriented quarterback Marcus Mariota for most of the 2018 season. During Week 2, Henry recorded an eight-yard pass completion, the first of his career, to wide receiver Taywan Taylor in the Titans' 20â17 victory over the Texans.[94] He also had 18 carries in that game and the next against the Jaguars, but was used much less frequently through the middle of the season. From Weeks 4â13, Henry averaged nine carries for only 37 yards per game, and never rushed for over 60 yards.[80] This all changed in Week 14 against the Jaguars. In the second quarter, Henry had a 99-yard touchdown run, fending off three tacklers, tying him with Tony Dorsett for the longest NFL touchdown run. He finished the game with four rushing touchdowns and 238 rushing yards on 17 carries, breaking Chris Johnson's franchise record of 228 yards in 2009.[95][96][97] He also became the ninth player in NFL history to record a 200+ yard and 4+ touchdown game, and the first to do so on fewer than 22 carries.[98] His 238 rushing yards were the most by any player for a single game for the 2018 season.[99] Henry was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week due to his spectacular performance.[100] During Week 15, the Titans went on the road to face the New York Giants. In a cold and rainy game, Henry led the NFL in rushing for the second consecutive week with 170 yards and two touchdowns on a career-high 33 carries, along with a one-yard reception and six-yard pass completion in the 17â0 shutout.[101] In Weeks 16 and 17, he combined for 177 rushing yards and a touchdown in the two games against the Washington Redskins and Colts.[102][103] He was later named the AFC Offensive Player of the Month for December.[104] Henry finished the 2018 season with 1,059 rushing yards and 12 touchdowns along with 15 receptions for 99 yards.[105] After the season, he was ranked 99th on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2019.[106] In the 2019 season opener against the Cleveland Browns, Henry rushed 19 times for 84 yards and a touchdown. He also caught one pass for a 75-yard touchdown as the Titans won on the road 43â13.[107] During Week 2 against the Colts, he rushed 15 times for 81 yards and a touchdown as the Titans narrowly lost 19â17.[108] Two weeks later against the Atlanta Falcons, Henry had his first 100-yard game of the season when he rushed for 100 yards on 27 carries in a 24â10 road victory.[109] In the next game against the Buffalo Bills, he rushed for 78 yards and a touchdown as the Titans lost by a score of 14â7.[110] After a season-low 28 yards in a Week 6 shutout loss to the Denver Broncos, Henry sank to 12th in the league in rushing, over 200 yards behind the league leaders he would eventually catch.[111] Henry responded with 90 rushing yards and a touchdown in a 23â20 victory against the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 7.[112] During Week 9 against the Carolina Panthers, Henry rushed 13 times for 63 yards and a touchdown and caught three passes for 36 yards and a touchdown in the 30â20 road loss.[113] In the next game against the Chiefs, he finished with 188 rushing yards and two touchdowns as the Titans narrowly won 35â32.[114] Henry won the FedEx Ground Player of the Week for his efforts.[115] During a Jaguars rematch in Week 12 after a Week 11 bye, Henry had a 74-yard rushing touchdown in the third quarter. Overall, he finished the 42â20 victory with 159 rushing yards and two touchdowns along with one reception for 16 yards.[116] In the next game, a rematch against the Colts, he rushed 26 times for 149 yards and a touchdown in the 31â17 road victory.[117] During Week 14 against the Oakland Raiders, Henry ran for 103 yards and two touchdowns in the 42â21 road victory.[118] During the regular-season finale against the Texans, Henry finished with 211 rushing yards and three touchdowns as the Titans won 35â14 and made it to the playoffs as a Wild Card team. During the game, Henry narrowly won the 2019 rushing title over Nick Chubb of the Cleveland Browns, with the winning rush being a 53-yard touchdown run.[119] This was Henry's first career rushing crown and the first Titan to win it since Chris Johnson in 2009.[120] Henry finished the regular season setting career-highs in carries with 303, rushing yards with 1,540, and rushing touchdowns with 16, which all led the league, despite only playing in 15 games, missing the Week 16 game against the New Orleans Saints due to a hamstring injury.[121] He also set career-highs in receptions with 16, receiving yards with 206, and receiving touchdowns with two.[122] On December 17, 2019, he was selected to his first Pro Bowl.[123] On January 3, 2020, he was named to the second-team All-Pro at both the running back and flex position, both behind Christian McCaffrey.[124] He was ranked 10th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2020.[125] With the Titans finishing the season 9â7, the team narrowly clinched a wild card spot for the #6 seed. In the Wild Card Round against the defending Super Bowl champion Patriots, which was played on his 26th birthday, Henry rushed for over 100 yards and a touchdown in the first half, finishing with 182 yards (the most ever against a Bill Belichick-led team, and the third most ever in a postseason road game) and a 22-yard reception in the 20â13 road victory. Henry became the first rushing champion with a 100-yard playoff game since Terrell Davis in 1998, the first to win a playoff game since LaDainian Tomlinson in 2007, and the second Titan with multiple post-season 100+ rushing games.[126] He also broke his own franchise record for most yards-from-scrimmage with 204.[127] During the Divisional Round against the Baltimore Ravens, Henry rushed 30 times for 195 yards and threw a three-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Corey Davis in the 28â12 road victory.[128] He became the second player in NFL history with three postseason games with at least 150 rushing yards, joining Terrell Davis, who had four. In addition, he became the only player with at least 175 rushing yards in consecutive games. Davis is the only other with two such games in a career.[129] In the AFC Championship against the Chiefs, Henry was mostly held in check. During the game, he rushed 19 times for 69 yards and a touchdown in the 35â24 road loss.[130] On March 16, 2020, the Titans placed the franchise tag on Henry.[131] He signed the tag on April 2, 2020.[132] Henry signed a new four-year $50 million contract with the team on July 15, 2020.[133] Despite leading the league in rushing yards for most of the first four weeks of the 2020 season, Henry was limited to no more than 3.7 yards per carry for all but one of them. These struggles ended in the week 6 game against the Texans, Henry finished with 212 rushing yards, 52 receiving yards, and two touchdowns (including a 94-yard rushing touchdown). In overtime, he finished the game with a five-yard touchdown to end the game as the Titans won 42â36.[134] Henry was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance in Week 6.[135] He was also named AFC Offensive Player of the Month for October after racking up 399 scrimmage yards with 344 yards rushing and five touchdowns.[136] During a Week 8 31â20 road loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, he ran for 112 yards and a touchdown.[137] In Week 11 against the Ravens, Henry had 133 rushing yards and the game-winning touchdown in overtime to defeat the Ravens on the road 30â24.[138][139] In a 45â26 road victory against the Colts in Week 12, Henry had 27 carries for 178 rushing yards and three touchdowns.[140] In Week 14 against the Jaguars, Henry rushed 26 times for 215 yards and two touchdowns during the 31â10 victory.[141] In Week 15 against the Detroit Lions, Henry rushed for 147 yards and a touchdown during the 46â25 win.[142] In Week 17 against the Houston Texans, Henry rushed for a career-high 250 rushing yards and two touchdowns during the 41â38 road victory.[143] Henry was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance.[144] During the game, Henry became the eighth running back in NFL history to surpass 2,000 rushing yards.[145] This also made him the only player to have 2,000 yard rushing seasons in high school, college, and the NFL.[146] In addition to his 2,027 rushing yards, Henry established career highs in carries (378), yards-per-carry (5.4) and rushing touchdowns (17). He was named the 2020 Offensive Player of the Year at the 10th Annual NFL Honors.[147] He was ranked fourth by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2021.[148] In the Wild Card Round of the playoffs against the Ravens, Henry was held without a single first down. He was limited to 40 yards on 18 carries (2.2 yards-per-carry) and three receptions for 11 yards during the 20â13 loss.[149] Henry began the season slow, held to only 58 rushing yards as the Titans lost to the Arizona Cardinals 38â13.[150] During Week 2 against the Seattle Seahawks, Henry finished with 182 rushing yards, 55 receiving yards, and three rushing touchdowns as the Titans won 33â30 in overtime. He earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week for Week 2.[151] In Week 6, Henry ran for 143 yards and three touchdowns in a 34â31 win over the Bills, earning his second AFC Offensive Player of the Week honor of the year.[152] During a Week 8 win against the Colts, Henry suffered a Jones fracture that would end up sidelining him for the remainder of the regular season.[153] He was placed on injured reserve on November 1.

He also had 28 receptions for 214 receiving yards.[185] On March 12, 2024, Henry signed with the Baltimore Ravens on a two-year, $16 million deal worth up to $20 million which also included $9 million fully guaranteed in the first year.[186] In Week 3, Henry had 151 rushing yards on 25 attempts and two touchdowns in a 28â25 win against the Cowboys.[187] In Week 4 against the Bills, Henry had 199 rushing yards and a touchdown on 24 carries with an 87-yard rushing score on the Ravensâ first offensive play, which was the longest run in franchise history. He also had 10 receiving yards and a touchdown on three receptions. The Ravens won 35â10.[188] For his performance in Week 4, Henry was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[189] In Week 5 against the Bengals, Henry scored his 100th overall career touchdown, while also reaching the mark of 10,000 career rushing yards later in the game, becoming the fifth player in NFL history to achieve the feat. The Ravens won in overtime, 41â38.[190] In Week 6, Henry rushed for 132 yards and two touchdowns in a 30-23 win over the Washington Commanders, earning AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[191] In Week 7 against the Buccaneers, he had 15 carries for 169 rushing yards and added a receiving touchdown in the 41â31 win.[192] In Week 9 against the Denver Broncos, he had 23 carries for 106 yards and two touchdowns in the 41â10 victory.[193] In Week 12, against the Los Angeles Chargers, he had 24 carries for 140 yards and a touchdown in the 30â23 win.[194] In Week 16 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, he had 24 carries for 162 yards in the 34â17 win.[195] In Week 17 against the Houston Texans, he had 27 carries for 147 yards and a touchdown in the 31â2 win.[196] Standing at 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) tall and weighing 247 pounds (112 kg), Henry is much larger than most running backs and has a frame comparable to that of a linebacker.[197] Henry is a \"power back\", using his large size and strength to overpower defenders, stiff arm and break tackles. In 2020, he accumulated 1,073 yards after contact, over 300 yards more than any running back in the league, and led the league in broken tackles with 34.[198] He couples that strength and size with surprising speed relative to his size.[199] Henry is adept at using the stiff-arm to repel defenders, with it being described as his \"signature\".[200][201] As a power back, his playing style contrasts with those of smaller, so-called \"scat backs\", who have greater elusiveness due to their faster ability to change directions. Henry is not usually used as a pass catcher, but he makes up for his lack of productiveness as a pass-catcher using his dominance as a pure runner.[198] Observers have also noted that Henry has a tendency to get better, particularly in yards per carry, in the later stages of a game, as his strength and toughness wears down opponents.[202] Henry's successful running game has also permitted the offense success with play-action.[203] In 2018, Henry fulfilled a promise to his grandmother by graduating from Alabama with a bachelor's degree in communications.[214] In November 2019, Henry's hometown of Yulee, Florida, celebrated him with a welcome sign in his honor. Fundraising for the sign came from local residents and businesses.[215] Henry has been in a relationship with Adrianna Rivas since 2016. They have two daughters.[216][217] Italics denotes active player",

While Henry will turn 30 years old this season, he can still get on a north/south track as a downhill hammer in the run game, with enough juice to create big plays. In 2023, Henry's 272 carries tied for the league lead, and his 2.22 yards after first contact ranked at the top. With the Ravens, Henry will work behind a stronger offensive front and pair with Lamar Jackson to create a dynamic backfield attack. Henry won't give you high-end receving numbers (27 receptions last season), but the rushing volume and scoring opportunities place the veteran in the upper-tier RB2 discussion.",

                "title": "Derrick Rose - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Derrick Martell Rose (born October 4, 1988) is an American former professional basketball player. He played one year of college basketball for the Memphis Tigers before being drafted first overall by his hometown Chicago Bulls in the 2008 NBA draft.[1] Nicknamed \"D-Rose\", and sometimes referred to as \"the Windy City Assassin\" or simply \"Pooh\",[2] he was named the NBA Rookie of the Year in 2009 and became the youngest player to win the NBA Most Valuable Player Award in 2011 at the age of 22 years and 7 months. Rose was born and raised in Chicago, and attended Simeon Career Academy. He was highly recruited by colleges, eventually choosing to join the University of Memphis under coach John Calipari. Rose led the Tigers to the most wins in NCAA history (a 38â2 record), their first number 1 ranking in 25 years, and an appearance in the NCAA championship game. In 2009, an NCAA investigation revealed that Rose's SAT scores had been invalidated, and as a result, the NCAA vacated Memphis' entire 2007â08 season.[3] Rose struggled with significant knee injuries throughout his career. In the first round of the 2012 NBA playoffs against the Philadelphia 76ers, Rose tore his ACL in his left knee. He required surgery and was subsequently sidelined for the entire 2012â13 season.[4] Rose returned to play in 2013â14, but in November 2013, he injured his right meniscus, causing him to miss the remainder of the season.[5] He returned once again the following season, but knee injuries continued to impact his availability and production. In June 2016, Rose was traded to the New York Knicks, where he finished the final year of his contract. He signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers on a minimum salary for the 2017â18 season but was hobbled by ankle injuries, which led to him being traded to, and subsequently waived by, the Utah Jazz in February 2018.[6] He signed with the Minnesota Timberwolves a month later on a rest-of-season contract; he stayed with the team through the following season and enjoyed a revived role as a sixth man off the bench despite missing 31 games due to injury management. For the 2019â20 season, the Detroit Pistons signed Rose to his first non-minimum salary contract since 2012, and he continued to be successful off the bench.[7] The following season, he was reunited with his former coach Tom Thibodeau when the Knicks re-acquired him in a trade. In July 2023, Rose signed to the Memphis Grizzlies in free agency, where he remained until September 2024, when Rose was released by the Grizzlies, and subsequently announced his own retirement. Rose was born and raised in the Englewood area, one of the most dangerous neighborhoods on Chicago's South Side.[8] He is the youngest son of Brenda Rose after Dwayne, Reggie, and Allan. All three were talented basketball players who taught Rose the ins and outs of basketball on nearby courts.[8][9] As his talent for the sport grew, Rose began to attract much more outside attention in Chicago's basketball circles, leading his mother and brothers to restrict outside contact to him. She feared he would be exploited and his path to the NBA diverted by outside parties like street agents, similar to what happened to former Chicago prospect Ronnie Fields.[10] By the time Rose enrolled at Simeon Career Academy in 2003, he was a hot commodity for collegiate coaches. Despite his reputation, he played freshmen and JV basketball for the Wolverines. He wore No. 25 in honor of Ben \"Benji\" Wilson, a promising player who was murdered by a gang member during his senior year in 1984.[11] Rose was not allowed on varsity due to a long-standing tradition that head coach Bob Hambric, who had been with the school since 1980 had no freshmen on the varsity team. That rule did not lessen Rose's play, and he went on to put up 18.5 points, 6.6 assists, 4.7 rebounds and 2.1 steals per game and led both the freshmen and sophomores to city championships with a 24â1 record.[12] Hambric softened his stance and allowed the freshman a chance to play on varsity in the state tournament, but Rose declined, wanting the players to get due credit.[13] The next year Hambric retired and Robert Smith was hired, opening the path to varsity. In Rose's debut, he had 22 points, 7 rebounds and 5 steals over Thornwood High School in a sold-out game filled with college scouts and coaches.[14] He led the Wolverines to a 30â5 mark while averaging 19.8 points, 5.1 rebounds, 8.3 assists and 2.4 steals but the season ended after a loss in state regionals. Rose's play garnered him his first national award: a Parade All-American third team spot.[15] During Rose's junior year in 2006, the Simeon Wolverines broke through and won the Chicago Public League championship held at the United Center, where Rose starred with 25 points and crowd pleasing dunks. The team advanced through the playoffs and earned a berth in the Class AA state championship against Richwoods High School, where a fourth quarter buzzer beater by Richwood forced overtime. The score was knotted at 29 late in the extra period when Rose stole the ball and buried the game winning jumper as time expired, giving Simeon its first state title since the Wilson-led Wolverines won in 1984. The team finished 33â4 and ranked nationally,[16] and Rose was awarded with an All-State Illinois mention, EA Sports All-American Second Team pick[17] and another Parade All-American selection.[18] Entering his senior year, Rose was ranked the fifth best prospect in the nation by Sports Illustrated. In January 2007, Simeon traveled to Madison Square Garden to play Rice High School and star guard Kemba Walker.[19] The Wolverines lost 53â51.[20][21] The season's highlight was a nationally televised contest on ESPN against Virginia perennial power Oak Hill Academy two weeks later. Matched up with hyped junior guard Brandon Jennings, Rose had 28 points, 9 assists, and 8 rebounds and in a 78â75 win.[22][23] For his performance, USA Today named him their high school player of the week.[24] Simeon went on to repeat as Public League champions[25] and defended their state championship, defeating O'Fallon High School 77â54.[26] In doing so, Simeon became the first Chicago Public League school to win two straight state championships. In his final high school game, Rose scored 2 points, but pulled down 7 rebounds and totaled 8 assists, while Simeon big man Tim Flowers scored 35 points.[27] The Wolverines ended the season 33â2 and ranked first in the nation by Sports Illustrated[28] and 6th on USA Today's Super 25.[29] Rose averaged 25.2 points, 9.1 assists, 8.8 rebounds and 3.4 steals. Overall, Simeon's record while Rose played was 120â12.[12] After his senior year, Rose was again All-State after being named Illinois Mr. Basketball[30] and was named to the McDonald's All-American team.[31] He was also awarded with First Team honors by Parade selection and USA Today[32] and USA Today First Team All-American. Rose was selected to play in the Jordan Brand All-Star Game and Nike Hoop Summit. In 2009, Rose was named the decade's third greatest high school point guard by ESPN RISE magazine behind Chris Paul and T. J. Ford,[33] and had his jersey number (#25) retired along with Ben Wilson.[34] Rose accepted a scholarship to play for the University of Memphis Tigers under John Calipari, who recruited him after seeing him play in an AAU game.[35] Strong efforts were made by Indiana University and in-state University of Illinois to sign Rose to their own programs.[36] Illinois in particular planned to pair Rose and their five-star recruit Eric Gordon, who had played AAU basketball with Rose.[37] Gordon, however, retracted his verbal commitment from the Fighting Illini, opting to play for Indiana, and Rose subsequently gave his verbal commitment before the start of his senior season.[38] Rose chose Memphis because of the school's history of putting players in the NBA and the prospect of Rod Strickland, a 17-year veteran of the league, mentoring him. Rose switched to #23, due to the fact that #25 had been retired by the school in honor of Penny Hardaway.[39] With the addition of Rose and led by veteran upperclassmen Joey Dorsey and Chris Douglas-Roberts, the Tigers started out the season ranked third in the nation. Memphis sprinted to a 26â0 start and claimed the number one ranking in the country for the first time in over 25 years before falling to the University of Tennessee Volunteers 66â62 in February.[40] Memphis was able to bounce back and capture the Conference USA tournament to qualify for the \"Big Dance\" with a 33â1 record.[41] Rose averaged 14.9 points per game, 4.7 assists and 4.5 rebounds per game during the regular season and earned All-American Third Team honors among others.[42] He finished as a finalist for the Bob Cousy Award as well as the John R. Wooden Award.[43] Memphis was seeded No. 1 in the South Region. Rose earned high praise for his increased focus on defense, hounding Texas Longhorn guard D. J. Augustin into a low-percentage game in the Elite Eight.[44] In a match-up against UCLA in the Final Four, Rose finished with 25 points and 9 rebounds to lead the Tigers to an 85â67 win and a trip to the NCAA championship game against the Kansas Jayhawks.[45] The win set an NCAA mark for most wins in a season (38).[46] Against Kansas, Rose scored 17 points on 7âofâ17 shooting, along with six rebounds and seven assists, but missed a critical free throw at the end of the second half as Memphis fell in overtime, 75â68.[47] Memphis concluded the season 38â2. Rose was named to the All-Final Four team after averaging 20.8 points, 6.5 rebounds and 6.0 assists per game.[48] On April 15, Rose announced he would forgo his final three seasons at Memphis and declared for the 2008 NBA draft.[49] According to Sheri Lipman of the University of Memphis legal counsel, a month after the loss to Kansas, the NCAA sent a letter to the school stating that Rose had \"an invalidated standardized test score the previous year at Chicago's Simeon High School.\" The next January, the NCAA sent another letter, charging Memphis with knowing that Rose had someone else take his SAT for him.[50] Memphis started its own investigation and sent its response back on April 24.[51] On May 28, 2009, the Memphis Commercial Appeal obtained the letter through the Freedom of Information Act and released it. Although the player's name was redacted due to privacy laws, process of elimination, and sources revealed the player as Derrick Rose. The next day, in a separate investigation, James Sullivan, Inspector General of the Chicago Public Schools district's Board of Education, released a report of his investigation stating that four student-athletes of a CPS school had one-month grade boosts to alter their college transcripts.[52] The Chicago Sun-Times revealed the school as Simeon Career Academy and that three of the four were Rose and his former teammates Kevin Johnson and Tim Flowers, prominent members of the back-to-back championship teams.[52] The newspaper claimed that Rose's grade was changed from a D to a C.[52] Another part of the report stated that \"high school staff lost the original permanent records for three of the above mentioned students athletes\" (including the unknown four).[53] Sullivan started the investigation because \"none of the grade changes were supported by any documentation.\" He also failed to find a suspect as \"at least seven people at Simeon had the ability to access student grades and records.\"[52] Illinois High School Association (IHSA) executive director Marty Hickman reacted by saying, \"It is obvious that this is worth taking a look into.\"[53] Robert Smith, who coached the Wolverines from 2004 to 2007, denied any wrongdoing.[52] District spokeswoman Monique Bond said the students involved probably did not know about the grade change. Allegations surfaced that Rose's brother, Reggie, had been allowed to travel with the team for free on several occasions.[54] Memphis contended that it had learned of the allegations about Rose's SAT score shortly after he enrolled at the school. It conducted its own investigation, in which Rose was questioned by four school officials. Ultimately, Memphis was unable to find any evidence that Rose had cheated based on what was available at the time and cleared him to play.[55] Rose released a statement through his lawyer Daniel E. Reidy: \"Mr. Rose is aware of the allegations reported in the press. Mr. Rose cooperated fully with the University of Memphis' athletic and legal departmentsâ investigation of this issue when he was a student, and that investigation uncovered no wrongdoing on his part.\" On August 20, 2009, the NCAA vacated Memphis' 2007â08 season. It took the position that because the Educational Testing Service voided Rose's SAT score after Rose's freshman year at Memphis, strict liability required that Rose be retroactively declared ineligible.[56] It also determined that even without the questions about his test score, Rose would have lost his eligibility in December 2007 due to Reggie Rose being allowed to travel for free.[57] On May 28, 2010, Rose, former Memphis basketball coach John Calipari, and Memphis athletic director R.C. Johnson reached a $100,000 out-of-court settlement with three attorneys who represented Memphis season ticket holders and threatened a lawsuit over the vacated 2007â08 season. The Memphis Commercial Appeal first reported on this settlement in October 2011.[58] Rose was selected with the first overall pick in the 2008 draft by the Chicago Bulls.[1][59] He was selected to the U.S. Select Team to scrimmage against and prepare the National Team for the Olympics in Beijing.[60][61][62] In mid-July, he played two games in the Orlando Pro Summer League until forced out by tendinitis in his right knee, ending his summer,[63] but returned in October to play all eight preseason games.[64] Rose became the first Bulls draftee to score 10 points or more in his first 10 games since Michael Jordan,[65] and earned Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month honors for November and December.[66][67] During the All-Star Weekend, Rose played in the Rookie Challenge,[68] and won the Skills Challenge, where he beat out several All-Stars to become the first rookie to claim the trophy.[69] Overcoming a January and February slump, Rose returned to form and won monthly rookie honors in March. Meanwhile, the Bulls, re-energized by the trade deadline acquisitions of John Salmons and Brad Miller, finished the regular season on a 12â4 spurt to qualify as the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference. Rose won Rookie of the Year, joining Jordan (1985) and Elton Brand (2000) as the only Bulls to do so.[70] He was also the first number-one draft pick since LeBron James to win the award. He averaged 16.8 points on 47.5% field goal shooting, 6.3 assists (leading all rookies) and 3.9 rebounds per game and was also named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team.[71] In his playoff debut against the defending champion Boston Celtics, Rose recorded 36 points (tying Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's NBA record for points scored by a rookie in his playoff debut, set in 1970), 11 assists, and 4 rebounds as the Bulls prevailed in a 105â103 overtime win on the road.[72][73][74] Rose became the second player in NBA history to record 35 points and 10 assists in his playoff debut, after Chris Paul. Rose averaged 19.7 points on 47.5% shooting, 6.3 assists and 4.9 rebounds per game in his first playoff series, as the Bulls were defeated by the Celtics in seven games.[75] Rose's sophomore season started off with an ankle injury in his first preseason game. Rose would go on to miss the rest of the preseason. Rose started the Bulls' season opener against the San Antonio Spurs but played limited minutes. Rose's ankle bothered him for most of November, but as his ankle healed, his game improved. On January 16, 2010, against the Washington Wizards, Rose recorded 37 points, including a layup to win the game 121â119 with 5.4 seconds to go in the second overtime.[76] On January 28, Rose was elected to his first career All-Star Game as a reserve for the Eastern Conference, making him the first Bulls player to be selected since Michael Jordan in 1998.[77] Rose ended up with eight points, four assists and three steals in the game. On April 13, 2010, Rose scored 39 points against the Boston Celtics, making 15â22 field goals and 9â10 free throws. The Bulls once again made the playoffs in the 2009â10 season, finishing with a 41â41 record. In the playoffs Rose averaged 26.8 points and 7.2 assists, but the Bulls lost in five games to the Cleveland Cavaliers.[78] On October 30, 2010, in the Bulls' second game of the season, Rose scored 39 points in a 101â91 win against the Detroit Pistons. Two days after, Rose contributed 13 assists, helping Luol Deng score a career-high 40 points in a win against the Portland Trail Blazers. On December 10, Rose scored 29 points and had 9 assists, leading the Bulls to their first victory over the Los Angeles Lakers since December 19, 2006. On January 16, 2011, Rose outdueled fellow Chicago native Dwyane Wade in a 99â96 win over the Miami Heat, scoring 34 points, of which 11 in the fourth quarter.[79] On January 17, he recorded his first career triple-double with 22 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists in a 96â84 win over the Memphis Grizzlies.[80] On January 27, Rose was announced as a starting guard on the 2011 NBA All-Star Team for the East squad.[81] On February 17, in the Bulls' last game before the All-Star break, Rose set a career-high with 42 points, while also recording 8 assists and 5 rebounds, as the Bulls beat the San Antonio Spurs 109â99. On March 19, he equalled that tally in a 115â108 overtime loss by the Indiana Pacers.[82] The loss was only one of two that the Bulls suffered in the last 23 games of the season. On March 26, Rose had a career-high 17 assists, along with 30 points, in a 95â87 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks. On April 10, Rose scored 39 points on 13-of-17 shooting in a 102â99 win over the Orlando Magic, in one of the final regular season matches of the season which saw the Bulls go undefeated in the month of April. On April 13, Rose put on a show at the Madison Square Garden with 26 points, shooting 10-of-19 and throwing down several crowd-pleasing dunks in a 103â90 win over the Knicks, leading coach Mike D'Antoni to compliment him in the post-game interview: \"His athletic ability is ridiculous. He's come farther, quicker, faster than anyone expected; he's playing at a level that not many people play.\"[83] At the end of the 2010â11 NBA season the Bulls finished with a league leading record of 62â20.[84] Their 60+ wins was the Bulls' first such season since 1997â98 and sixth 60+ win in franchise history.[85] At season's end, Rose became only the third player since the 1972â73 NBA season to record 2,000 points and 600 assists in a single season. The other two players were LeBron James and Michael Jordan.[86] On May 3, Rose was named the NBA Most Valuable Player, joining Jordan as the only players to receive the award in Chicago Bulls history.[87] At 22 years and 6 months old, Rose also became the youngest player to receive the award (Wes Unseld, formerly the youngest MVP, won the award in 1968â69 at age 23 years, 2 months). In the 2011 NBA playoffs, the Bulls defeated the Indiana Pacers and Atlanta Hawks in the first two rounds. In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Bulls faced the Miami Heat, led by James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. The Bulls lost the series in five games. During the 2011 playoffs, Rose averaged 27.1 points per game, but only shot 39% from the field and 24% for three-pointers.[88] In December 2011, Rose signed a five-year contract extension with the Bulls for $94.8 million. The contract was 30 percent of the Bulls' salary cap, the maximum allowed under a rule dubbed the \"Derrick Rose Rule\" from the 2011 NBA Collective Bargaining Agreement.[89] On December 25, in the Christmas Day matchup against the Los Angeles Lakers, Rose scored 22 points on 9-from-13 shooting, and hit a game winning floater with 4.8 seconds left to secure an 88â87 win for the Bulls.[90] On January 11, 2012, Rose had a double-double in a 111â100 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves, scoring 31 points (of which 14 on 6-of-7 shooting in the first quarter) and dishing 11 assists in a much-anticipated battle with young Spanish guard Ricky Rubio.[91] On January 30, against the Eastern Conference rival Miami Heat, Rose scored 34 points, but missed two key free throws with 22 seconds left, and then had a jumper bounce off the rim with three seconds on the clock, resulting with a 97â93 loss for the Bulls.[92] However, he bounced back the next day, scoring a season-high 35 points in a 98â88 win over the Washingtons Wizards, with coach Tom Thibodeau stating after the game that Rose \"imposes his will on everybody\".[93] In February 2012, Rose was voted as an All-Star Game starter for the second consecutive year. He was the second leading vote getter behind Orlando Magic center Dwight Howard. On March 5, 2012, Rose tied his season-high with 35 points against the Philadelphia 76ers, including a basket with 20 seconds left to seal a 96â91 win. Philadelphia coach Doug Collins tried to have defensive specialists Jrue Holiday, Andre Iguodala and Evan Turner take turns guarding Rose, but to little effect, as he hit a series of spectacular shots and added eight assists to announce his return to MVP form.[94] On March 7, Rose confirmed his clutch reputation as he hit a step back fadeaway jumper to beat the buzzer against the Milwaukee Bucks, handing the Bulls a 106â104 win. He recorded another double-double with 30 points and 11 assists.[95] The Bulls ended the season on a high, winning 18 out of their last 20 games, as Rose averaged 21.8 points per game, along with a career-high 7.9 assists in 35.3 minutes per game. Despite having played a career low 39 games due to injuries, Rose managed to record nine double-doubles. He also helped Luol Deng become an All-Star for the first time in his career. During Game 1 of the first round of the playoffs against the Philadelphia 76ers, Rose injured his left knee while trying to jump. He was immediately helped off the court. The injury occurred when the Bulls were leading by 12 points with 1:22 left to play. Rose came up just short of a triple-double, finishing with 23 points, 9 assists, and 9 rebounds in 37 minutes of action.[96] An MRI later revealed that Rose tore the ACL in his left knee and would miss the rest of the playoffs.[97] Rose had surgery performed on May 12, 2012, with an estimated recovery period of 8â12 months.[4] Rose returned to full contact practice in January 2013,[98] and was cleared by doctors to play in March,[99] but he did not appear in a game during the 2012â13 NBA season. He was heavily criticized by Bulls fans for his decision to sit out the season, but maintained that he must listen to his body and will only return when he's 100 percent healed.[100][101] Despite Rose's absence, the Bulls advanced to the Eastern Conference Semifinals, where they lost to the eventual champions, the Miami Heat. Rose's much awaited return came on October 5, 2013, in a pre-season game against the Indiana Pacers. He had a slow start but scored his first point in the first quarter. He finished the game with 13 points in 20 minutes of play.[102] On October 16, 2013, Rose returned to play in Chicago for the first time, scoring 22 points against the Detroit Pistons. \"I think I'm way more explosive now. Like getting to the rim. I think I can take contact a little bit better. And as far as jumping-wise, I think I can jump even higher. They tested my vertical â I increased it by 5 inches,\" Rose said after the win.[103] During the pre-season, Rose averaged 20.7 points and 5.0 assists. His first official game was in 107â95 loss against the defending champions Miami Heat on October 29. Rose was limited to 12 points, while having four assists in 34 minutes of play. He played his usual minutes, but was inefficient from the field, shooting 4â15.[104] Two days later, he played his first official home game against the New York Knicks where he hit the game-winning floater in an 82â81 win. He had 18 points, six rebounds and 3 assists.[105] On November 3, 2013, Rose scored 13 points and committed 8 turnovers in the loss against the Philadelphia 76ers.[106] He struggled in his return, shooting 28.8% from the field and averaging 5.7 turnovers in his first three games.[107] On November 22, Rose injured his right knee during a game against the Portland Trail Blazers. An MRI the next day confirmed that Rose tore his right knee meniscus and that surgery was required.[108] At the time, Rose was averaging 15.9 points and 4.3 assists in 31.1 minutes per game. On November 25, Rose underwent surgery on the torn meniscus in his right knee.[5] The same day, the Bulls announced Rose was out for the season, after a successful surgery.[109] Rose returned from injury to play in the Bulls' season opener against the New York Knicks on October 29, 2014, and recorded 13 points and five assists in 21 minutes of action. He went on to score a season-high 32 points on January 14, 2015, against the Washington Wizards.[110] On January 28, Rose scored a step-back jumper with seven seconds on the clock to give the Bulls a 113â111 overtime win over the Golden State Warriors; however he only made 13 out of 33 shots from the field, and had a career-high 11 turnovers.[111] Two weeks later Rose was ruled out again with another knee injury. On February 24, it was announced Rose required another round of surgery on his right knee and was ruled out indefinitely. An exam and subsequent MRI confirmed a medial meniscus tear of the right knee, the same injury he sustained on November 22, 2013, against the Portland Trail Blazers.[112][113] On February 27, he was deemed a possibility of returning toward the end of the season after he underwent successful surgery and was ruled out for just four to six weeks.[114] Rose returned to action on April 8 after a 20-game absence, and working on a minutes restriction, he was 3-of-9 from the field and finished with nine points in 19 minutes as the Bulls lost to the Orlando Magic.[115] He appeared in 51 games, the most he'd played since the 2010â11 season.[116] On April 18, 2015, Rose played in his first playoff game since Game 1 of the 2012 playoffs (the game where he tore his left ACL). Rose finished with 23 points and seven assists on 9-of-16 shooting.[117] He had a vintage performance in Game 3 in which he scored 34 points, making five three-pointers from nine attempts and adding eight assists in a tight 113â106 win in overtime, helping his team to a 3â0 lead against the Milwaukee Bucks.[118] During the Bulls' first round series against the Bucks, Rose averaged 21.5 points per game. On May 8, Rose banked in a three-pointer at the buzzer and scored 30 points to give the Bulls a 99â96 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers and a 2â1 lead in the Eastern Conference semi-finals.[119] He followed up that performance by recording 31 points in Game 4, including a contested layup to tie the game at 84â84; however, after the referees failed to award a technical foul to Cavaliers coach David Blatt for attempting to call a timeout without having any remaining, LeBron James hit a jumper from the corner in the last second to win the game 86â84 and tie the series 2â2.[120] After the deflating loss, the Bulls couldn't stop the Cavaliers who won the final two games to take the series in six games. A preseason left orbital bone fracture saw Rose begin the regular season wearing a face mask.[121] On November 5, 2015, Rose scored a then season-high 29 points on 12-of-25 shooting in a 104â98 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder. He showed signs of his old MVP ability as he scored 10 points over the final three and a half minutes to lift the Bulls after they blew a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter.[122] On December 18, he scored a season-high 34 points in a 147â144 quadruple overtime loss to the Detroit Pistons.[123] On February 5, 2016, he had a season-best game with 30 points, 9 rebounds and 8 assists in a 115â110 loss to the Denver Nuggets.[124] On February 19, in a rematch of the previous playoffs' Eastern Conference semi-finals, Rose won the individual matchup against Cleveland Cavaliers point guard Kyrie Irving, scoring 28 points to Irving's 19, but the Cavaliers prevailed 106â95 over the Bulls.[125] On February 22, Rose spoiled Kobe Bryant's farewell tour in his final season as an NBA player, as he led the Bulls in scoring with 24 points in a 126â115 win over the Lakers in Bryant's last game at the United Center.[126] On March 25, Rose again dazzled the Madison Square Garden, scoring 30 points with a variety of acrobatic finishes and circus shots; however the Bulls lost 106â94 against the Knicks.[127] The season ended with a disappointment for the Bulls, as they didn't reach the playoffs for the first time since 2008, leading to a change in direction for the franchise. While Rose averaged a respectable 16.4 points and 4.7 assists per game in 66 games, the decline of his production, efficiency and on-court impact indicated that he was no longer capable of performing at same level as his pre-injury MVP self.[128][129] Journalist A.J. Neuharth-Keutsch asserted for USA Today that Rose \"struggled to find the explosiveness, confidence and versatility that he once possessed\",[130] while ESPN's Nick Friedell lamented that \"whatever the reason, Rose evolved into a different player - glimpses of brilliance were still there on certain nights, but the virtuoso performances were not\".[131] On June 22, 2016, Rose was traded, along with Justin Holiday and a 2017 second-round draft pick, to the New York Knicks in exchange for JosÃ© CalderÃ³n, Jerian Grant and Robin Lopez.[132] Rose opted for the number 25 shirt which he wore in his high school days, and stated that the Knicks are a \"super team\" with him, Carmelo Anthony and Kristaps PorziÅÄ£is among the ranks.[133] It was later revealed that the point guard cried upon receiving the news from his agent that the Bulls decided to trade him.[134] Rose made his debut for the Knicks in the team's season opener on October 25 against the Cleveland Cavaliers. In 29 minutes of action, he scored 17 points on 7-of-17 shooting in a 117â88 loss.[135] On November 4, Rose returned to Chicago for the first time as a member of the Knicks, recording 15 points and 11 assists in a 117â104 win over the Bulls.[136] On November 17, he scored a season-high 27 points in a 119â112 loss to the Washington Wizards.[137] He topped that mark on November 28, scoring 30 points in a 112â103 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder.[138] On December 3, Rose scored 24 points on 9-of-15 shooting against the Minnesota Timberwolves, hitting two key free throws with half a minute to go, to give the Knicks an insurmountable eight-point lead before ultimately winning 118â114.[139] On December 12, he scored 25 points in a 118â112 win over the Los Angeles Lakers, hitting a clutch push shot with 19.4 seconds left to put the game beyond doubt.[140] On January 10, 2017, Rose was fined an undisclosed amount after he reportedly flew to Chicago to be with his mother but did not notify team officials ahead of their game against the New Orleans Pelicans on January 9.[141] Eight days later, he matched his season high with 30 points in a 117â106 win over the Boston Celtics.[142] As the season progressed, Rose increasingly expressed frustration with coach Jeff Hornacek's implementation of the triangle offense, describing it as \"random\" and \"confusing\".[143] On April 2, 2017, he was ruled out for the rest of the season after tearing the meniscus in his left knee, necessitating a fourth round of knee surgery for Rose in his nine-year career.[144] The Knicks vastly underperformed in the 2016â17 season, ending with a 31â51 record and missing the playoffs. On July 25, 2017, Rose signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers, joining forces with LeBron James.[145] In his debut for the Cavaliers in their season opener against the Boston Celtics on October 17, 2017, Rose scored 14 points in a 102â99 win.[146] In his highest-scoring game for the Cavaliers, on November 4, Rose recorded 20 points in a 130â122 win over the Washington Wizards. Four days later, against the Milwaukee Bucks, he suffered an ankle injury, after being fouled by Greg Monroe on a drive to the basket. On November 24, 2017, Rose left the team to re-evaluate his future in the NBA. His persistent injury issues caused him to question his desire to continue playing.[147] He returned to working with the Cavaliers' medical staff in early December in hopes of recovering from a sprained left ankle and bone spurs.[148] On January 18, 2018, Rose returned to the line-up after missing more than two months with ankle injuries and scored nine points in 13 minutes in a 104â103 win over the Orlando Magic.[149] On February 8, 2018, Rose was acquired by the Utah Jazz in a three-team trade that also involved the Cavaliers and the Sacramento Kings.[150] Two days later, he was waived by the Jazz.[151] On March 8, 2018, Rose signed with the Minnesota Timberwolves,[152] reuniting him with Tom Thibodeau, Jimmy Butler and Taj Gibson. After slowly getting back to his rhythm towards the end of the regular season, Rose averaged 14.2 points in 23.8 minutes per game in the playoffs, as the Timberwolves lost 4â1 to the Houston Rockets in the first round.[153] His best performance of the series came on April 24, 2018, in Game 5, as he scored 17 points on 7-of-11 shooting in 32 minutes on the floor, including 2-of-2 from distance; however the Rockets won 119â100 after outscoring the Timberwolves 50â20 in the third quarter which Rose started on the bench.[154] On July 4, 2018, Rose re-signed with the Timberwolves for the 2018â19 season.[155] On October 31, in his first start of the season, Rose scored a career-high 50 points in a 128â125 win over the Utah Jazz, securing the victory with a block on Utah's final shot as time expired.[156] Rose shot 19-of-31 in 41 minutes on the court, hit four three pointers, and had 15 points in the last quarter, of which six came in the last minute. After the buzzer sounded, an emotional Rose burst into tears as his teammates swarmed him while MVP chants came from the crowd. In the post-game interview, when asked what the feat meant to him, Rose said: \"Everything, I worked my [expletive] off\".[157] He received praise from players all over the league; LeBron James called Rose \"a superhero\" and a true definition of perseverance, while Dwyane Wade said that Rose was an example of never giving up on yourself.[158] Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau after the game said that Rose \"has the character, the humility and the courage\", adding that he is among the most mentally tough people he had come across.[159] On November 8, Rose recorded 31 points in a 114â110 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers, hitting a career-best 7 three pointers from 9 attempts.[160] On December 26, he had 24 points and eight assists and again received MVP chants in a 119â94 win over the Bulls in Chicago. It was only his second career game in the United Center against his former team.[161] On January 15, 2019, against the Philadelphia 76ers, Rose reached 10,000 career points.[162] On January 20, he scored 29 of his 31 points in the second half and hit an 18-footer with 0.6 seconds left to give the Timberwolves a 116â114 victory over the Phoenix Suns.[163] Right ankle trouble saw Rose miss 11 of 19 games spanning late December to late January.[164] He missed an additional three games in early February.[165] On March 21, he was ruled out for the rest of the season with a right elbow injury.[166] Rose ended the season with 18.0 points and 4.3 assists per game, with a career-high 37% field goal percentage for three pointers. However, the Timberwolves missed the playoffs, as they ended the season with a 36â46 record, enough only for the 11th spot in the Western Conference. On July 7, 2019, Rose signed with the Detroit Pistons.[167] On October 23, he made his debut for the Pistons, logging 18 points, three rebounds, and nine assists in a 119â110 win over the Indiana Pacers.[168] On December 9, Rose scored the game winner in a 105â103 win over the New Orleans Pelicans, hitting a buzzer beater with a close range fadeaway jumper against Jrue Holiday. Rose scored 17 out of his 21 points in the fourth quarter, where he shot 7-of-8 from the field, including two three pointers from two attempts.[169] On December 15, in the 115â107 win against the Houston Rockets, he had a double-double with 20 points and 12 assists, scoring ten points in the final quarter.[170] Rose became the first player in Pistons history to record seven consecutive 20+ point games as a reserve, which also coincided with his career-high 14-game streak of scoring 20 points or more.[171] The most notable games of the streak included a 116â103 win over the Boston Celtics on January 15, 2020, in which Rose scored 22 points on 11-of-13 shooting,[172] followed by a 136â103 win against the Atlanta Hawks three days later, where he had 27 points and 9 assists.[173] The streak ended after he suffered a groin injury during a game against the Denver Nuggets.[174] During the month of January when he accomplished the feat, Rose averaged 22 points, six assists and three rebounds, while shooting 51% from the floor.[175] In his third game after returning from injury, Rose scored a season-high 31 points en route to a win against the Phoenix Suns.[176][177] Despite a strong individual season by Rose as the team's sixth man, the Pistons ended the season at the 13th place in the Eastern Conference with a disappointing 20â46 record, having struggled without their best player Blake Griffin, who featured in only 15 games due to injuries. On February 8, 2021, Rose was traded back to the New York Knicks for Dennis Smith Jr. and a 2021 second-round draft pick, once again reuniting him with coach Tom Thibodeau and former teammate Taj Gibson.[178] Rose made his return debut on February 20 in a 98â96 loss against the Miami Heat, in which he provided an immediate offensive spark for the Knicks, scoring 14 points and dishing three assists.[179] He peaked in May, scoring 25 points on 11-of-15 shooting in the 118â104 win against the Memphis Grizzlies on May 4,[180] and equalling that tally while adding eight assists six days later in a 106â100 win against the Los Angeles Clippers.[181] On May 12, in an overtime loss against the Los Angeles Lakers, he recorded a season-high 27 points with 6 assists and 6 rebounds.[182] Rose was a major contributor coming from the bench, helping the Knicks finish fourth in the East and placing third in the Sixth Man of the Year voting.[183] On May 24, 2021, in his first playoff game since 2018, Rose had 17 points, five assists and five rebounds off the bench as the Knicks lost to the Atlanta Hawks 107â105.[184] In Game 2, coach Thibodeau put Rose in the starting unit for the second half after initially being on the bench, and he responded with a game-high 26 points for the Knicks, leading his team to a 101â92 win to even the series.[185] On May 28, during Game 3 of the Knicks' first round series against the Atlanta Hawks, Rose made his first playoff start since the 2015 conference semifinals, recording a season-high 30 points, as well as six rebounds and five assists, in a 105â94 loss as Atlanta took a 2â1 series lead.[186] The Hawks went on to win the series 4â1, as Rose suffered a knee injury in the closing of the series.[187] He averaged 19.4 points over the five games, leading the Knicks in scoring for the series. On August 18, 2021, the Knicks extended Rose's contract by three years with a $43 million deal.[188][189] On November 3, Rose surpassed 12,000 career points in a 111â98 loss against the Indiana Pacers.[190] On November 6, Rose helped the Knicks erase a 21-point deficit against the champion Milwaukee Bucks, scoring 23 points off the bench on 10-of-18 shooting in a 113â98 win.[191] On December 17, 2021, in a 116â103 win over the Houston Rockets, Rose suffered a right ankle injury.[192] Five days later, he had surgery on his ankle and was ruled out for at least two months.[193] On February 25, 2022, Rose underwent another procedure to address a skin infection on his ankle and was ruled out indefinitely.[194] In the 2022â23 season, Rose averaged only 12 minutes per game from the bench and was removed from the Knicks rotation by Tom Thibodeau in December 2022.[195] On June 24, 2023, the Knicks declined Rose's team option for the 2023â24 season, rendering him a free agent.[196] On July 3, 2023, Rose signed with the Memphis Grizzlies.[197] He chose to wear the number 23, the same number he wore when playing for the University of Memphis.[198] He received an ovation in his debut from Memphis fans on October 26, as he scored 8 points in 16 minutes off the bench in a 111â104 loss to the New Orleans Pelicans.[199] In November 2023, Rose missed eight games due to left knee soreness.[200] On November 24, Rose scored a then season-high 17 points on 8-of-9 shooting in a 110â89 loss to the Phoenix Suns.[201] Rose was named a starter for the Grizzlies for the first time on November 30 against the Utah Jazz, helping his team to a 105â91 win with 14 points on 7-of-11 shooting from the field, and nine assists.[202] On December 14, Rose posted a season-high 19 points in a 117â104 loss against the Houston Rockets, playing a season-high 31 minutes. Two days later, in a rematch against the Rockets, Rose suffered a hamstring injury on his left leg, which kept recurring in January and February, reducing him to sporadic appearances and limited minutes for the Grizzlies.[citation needed] On March 30, 2024, he was ruled out for the rest of the season with a lower back injury suffered in the beginning of March.[203] He finished the season with an average of 8 points, 3 assists and 2 rebounds in 16 minutes per game, having played in only 24 games due to injuries.[citation needed] Rose indicated his intention to return to the Grizzlies for the 2024â25 season.[204] However, on September 23, 2024, he was waived by the Grizzlies.[205] On September 26, 2024, Rose announced his retirement.[206] Rose was a member of the United States men's national basketball teams that won gold medals at the 2010 and 2014 FIBA World Cup. Standing at 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 m) and weighing 200 pounds (91 kg), Rose played mostly at the point guard position. He averaged 17.4 points per game for his career.[207] Rose has one All-NBA selection to his name in 2011, the year he was also voted NBA MVP of the regular season. He also won the NBA Rookie of the Year award in 2009.[208] In his prime in Chicago, Rose was widely considered to be one of the most athletic point guards in NBA history before a string of knee injuries slowed him down.[209] A combination of explosiveness, leaping ability and speed allowed him to attack the basket frequently, using a repertoire of acrobatic finishes to score over taller players. Rose clocked in a maximum vertical jump of 40 inches during the 2008 NBA Combine.[210] After the injuries, Rose compensated for his loss of athleticism by becoming more patient, methodical and creative with his shot selection, which increased his efficiency compared to his early years when he considered himself to be more \"reckless\".[211] His control, composure and finesse helped him keep his place among the best rim finishers in the NBA in the 2019â20 season, with his 4.7 field goals made on drives coming second behind only Luka DonÄiÄ and Russell Westbrook with 4.8, while he ranked first in the league in field goal percentage on attempts from drives among players with at least 6.0 attempts with 56.4%.[212] In the process of reinventing his game, Rose also increased his reliance on floaters, runners and push shots, leading the league in the 2020â21 season in accuracy with 53% from the field on these attempts.[213] Due to Rose's injury history, in his later years his minutes on the court were reduced and he became more of a role player. Rose was never a knock-down shooter from the arc, shooting 30 percent during his career.[214] However, in the later stages of his career, he improved his shooting mechanics and managed to develop a reliable three point shot.[215] In his second stint with the New York Knicks, Rose shot above 40 percent from three. Rose started using the bank shot more frequently and with greater success during the 2015â16 season, after struggling with his shooting due to what he attributed to depth perception issues following eye surgery in 2015.[216][217] Rose received criticism about his defense early in his career,[218][219] but he was praised for his defensive contributions as a veteran in his second Knicks stint.[220] Rose has also been widely recognized for his leadership skills and mentoring of younger players.[221][222] Rose is a Christian and has spoken about his faith, saying \"God does everything for a reason\".[238] He wears a wristband that says \"In Jesus' Name I Play\"[239][240] and has several tattoos about his faith.[241] On October 9, 2012, Rose's ex-girlfriend, Mieka Reese, gave birth to their son Derrick Jr.[242] In 2016, Rose started dating model and fitness influencer Alaina Anderson. The two married on September 7, 2023, in Los Angeles, after getting engaged in 2021.[243][244] Their daughter Layla was born in 2018 and their son London in 2019.[245] Rose's agent is former Bulls guard B. J. Armstrong.[246] In 2018, Rose introduced The Rose Scholars, a scholarship program to help students achieve a higher education.[247][248] Rose is an avid chess player, with The Sporting News saying, \"There is no bigger (chess) fanatic in the NBA than Rose.\"[249][250] In 2016, Rose was involved in a federal civil lawsuit to assess whether he and two friends raped an unnamed former girlfriend in August 2013.[251] In the months before the alleged gang-rape, Rose's accuser, referred to as \"Jane Doe\" in court transcripts, testified that Rose made her uncomfortable by asking her to perform sexual acts for him or to involve other people in their sex life; he would sometimes get angry when she refused.[252] Doe also mentioned that on the day of the incident, she was drugged against her consent, and alternated in and out of consciousness.[253] During the trial, Rose expressed difficulty and uncertainty with the definition of the word \"consent\".[254] In October 2016, he was found not liable by an eight-member jury.[255] An appeal in 2018 was denied.[256] Rose was the cover athlete of NBA 2K13 alongside fellow NBA players Kevin Durant and Blake Griffin.[257] Rose was the lone cover athlete for the 2K Sports Downloadable Content game, NBA 2K10 Draft Combine, which was released on Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3.[258] Rose is a part-owner and spokesman for the Chicago-based Giordano's Pizzeria.[259] In 2008, Rose signed a shoe deal with Adidas for $1 million per year.[260][261] He has also signed with Wilson Sporting Goods.[262] Other endorsement deals include Skullcandy headphones, Powerade, Force Factor sports drinks and a suburban Chicago Nissan dealership.[263] In May 2018, it was announced that the Adidas D Rose 9's would be released in July 2018.[264] In 2011, Rose was estimated by Crain's Chicago Business to earn $1.5â$2.5 million annually in endorsements, ranking just outside the top 10 NBA players in that category.[265] In 2012, it was reported that Rose signed a contract extension with Adidas, worth $185 million over 14 years.[266]",

He led the team to a resurgence following the iconic 1990s era, re-energizing the franchise and providing excitement for a new generation. Now, as he enjoys life after basketball, Rose is set to receive a tribute from the Bulls, but he has firmly stated what he doesnât want. In an interview with ESPNâs Shams Charania, Rose was asked about the possibility of a statue being erected in his honor at the United Center. His response was straightforward: âThe statueâ¦ With the way people are creating the statues, no,â Rose quipped, causing the reporter to laugh. âI do not want no statue. No statue.â Rose then turned to the camera, sending a clear message to the Bullsâ leadership. âJerry, no statues, man. Please, Michael, no statue.â This was directed at Jerry Reinsdorf, the Bullsâ owner, and Michael Reinsdorf, the teamâs president. Itâs easy to understand Roseâs reluctance. His comments seem to reference the recent unveiling of Dwyane Wadeâs statue in Miami. The tribute sparked social media jokes about the statueâs resemblance to the Heat legend, and itâs likely that Rose wants to avoid any similar outcomes. Dwyane Wadeâs statue, the first in Miami Heat history, outside of the Kaseya Center. After the humorous exchange, Derrick Rose became more serious and spoke candidly about the tribute he would truly appreciate from the Bulls. âThe jersey thing, my jersey being retired, I would love that,â he said. âThat would be my way of getting close to the Top 75, and Iâm only saying that because it relates to the MVP. Itâs only a handful, a small group that got that trophy back there.â Roseâs wish will soon be granted. On Saturday night, the Chicago Bulls will host the New York Knicks at the United Center, marking âDerrick Rose Night.â The evening will feature a series of tributes to the former guard, including both teams wearing warm-up shirts honoring Rose and displaying memorabilia from his illustrious career. In addition, the Bulls announced through CEO Michael Reinsdorf that Roseâs jersey will be retired during the 2025-26 NBA season, making him the fifth player in franchise history to receive this honor. see also NBA News: Grizzlies star Ja Morant admits he may have found perfect partner in Memphis When Roseâs No. 1 is raised to the rafters, he will join an elite group of Bulls legends.

                "content": "The Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team represents Duke University in NCAA Division I college basketball and competes in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). The team is fourth all-time in wins of any NCAA men's basketball program,[2] and is currently coached by Jon Scheyer. Duke has won 5 National Championships (tied with Indiana for fifth all-time behind UCLA, Kentucky, North Carolina, UConn), and appeared in 11 Championship Games (third all-time) and 17 Final Fours (tied for third all-time with Kentucky and only behind North Carolina and UCLA). Additionally, all of Duke's championships were won after the NCAA instituted a shot clock. Duke has an NCAA-best .755 NCAA tournament winning percentage. Eleven Duke players have been named the National Player of the Year, and 71 players have been selected in the NBA draft. Additionally, Duke has had 36 players named All-Americans (60 total selections) and 14 players named Academic All-Americans. Duke has been the Atlantic Coast Conference Champions a record 22 times, and also lays claim to 19 ACC regular season titles. Prior to joining the ACC, Duke won the Southern Conference championships five times. Duke has also finished the season ranked No. 1 in the AP poll eight times[3] and is the all-time leader in total weeks ranked as the number one team in the nation by the AP with 145 weeks.[4] Additionally, the Blue Devils have the third longest streak in the AP Top 25 in history with 200 consecutive appearances from 1996 to 2007, trailing only Kansas' 231 consecutive polls from 2009 to 2021, and UCLA's 221 consecutive polls from 1966 to 1980. In 1906, Wilbur Wade Card, Trinity College's Athletic Director and a member of the Class of 1900, introduced the game of basketball to Trinity. The January 30 issue of The Trinity Chronicle headlined the new sport on its front page. Trinity's first game ended in a loss to Wake Forest, 24â10. The game was played in the Angier B. Duke Gymnasium, later known as The Ark. The Trinity team won its first title in 1920, the state championship, by beating the North Carolina State College of Agriculture and Engineering (now NC State) 25 to 24. Earlier in the season they had beaten the University of North Carolina 19â18 in the first match-up between the two schools. Trinity college then became Duke University.[5] Billy Werber, Class of 1930, became Duke's first All-American in basketball.[6] The Gothic-style West Campus opened that year, with a new gym, later to be named for Coach Card. The Indoor Stadium opened in 1940. Initially it was referred to as an \"Addition\" to the gymnasium. Part of its cost was paid for with the proceeds from the Duke football team's appearance in the 1938 Rose Bowl. In 1972 it would be named for Eddie Cameron, head coach from 1929 to 1942. In 1952, Dick Groat became the first Duke player to be named National Player of the Year.[7] Duke left the Southern Conference to become a charter member of the Atlantic Coast Conference in 1953. The Duke team under Vic Bubas made its first appearance in the Final Four in 1963, losing 94â75 to Loyola Chicago in the semifinal. The next year, Bubas' team reached the national title game, losing to the Bruins of UCLA, which claimed the first of that program's 10 titles in the next 12 years. Bob Verga was Duke's star player in 1967. The basketball program won its 1000th game in 1974, making Duke only the eighth school in NCAA history to reach that figure.[8] In a turnaround, Coach Bill Foster's 1978 Blue Devils, who had gone 2â10 in the ACC the previous year, won the conference tournament and went on to the NCAA championship game, where they fell to Kentucky. Gene Banks, Mike Gminski ('80) and Jim Spanarkel ('79) ran the floor. Mike Krzyzewski was at Duke from 1980 to 2022. Krzyzewski's teams made the Final Four in 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1994, 1999, 2001, 2004, 2010, 2015 and 2022. In Krzyzewski's first season, the Blue Devils would finish the season with a 17â13 overall record and 6â8 record in ACC play. The team would later play in the NIT tournament advancing to the quarterfinals. Despite having a good record the previous season, the Blue Devils would struggle during the next two seasons finishing with 10 wins in 1982 and 11 wins in 1983. The 1984 team, led by Tommy Amaker & Johnny Dawkins, would bounce back in strong fashion finishing 24â10 and was ranked the No.14 in the AP and Coaches poll, but lost in the second round of the NCAA tournament to the Washington Huskies (having earned a first-round bye).[10][11] In 1985 Duke defeated Pepperdine in the first round of the NCAA tournament, for Krzyzewski's first tournament win, but lost to Boston College in the second round 74â73. The next season the Blue Devils made their first Final Four under Krzyzewski. They beat Kansas to advance to the title game against Louisville, where they ultimately lost 72â69. Duke upset the heavily favored UNLV Runnin' Rebels 79â77 in the Final Four in 1991, a rematch of the 1990 final in which Duke lost by 30 points. The team, led by Christian Laettner, Bobby Hurley, Grant Hill, and Thomas Hill, went on to defeat Kansas 72â65 to win the university's first NCAA Championship.[12] Ranked #1 all season and favored to repeat as national champions in 1992, Duke took part in a game \"acclaimed by many [as] the greatest college basketball game ever played,\" according to ESPN.[13][14][15] In the Elite Eight, Duke met the Rick Pitino-led Kentucky Wildcats. It appeared Kentucky had sealed the win in overtime when guard Sean Woods hit a running shot off the glass in the lane to put Kentucky up by one with 2.1 seconds left on the clock. After a timeout, Duke's Grant Hill threw a full-court pass to Christian Laettner. Laettner took one dribble and nailed a turn-around jumper at the buzzer to send Duke into the Final Four with a 104â103 victory (The Shot). Duke went on to defeat sixth-seeded Michigan, led by the Fab Five as freshmen starters including Chris Webber, Jalen Rose and Juwan Howard, 71â51 to repeat as national champions.[16] Following the successful repeat, Laettner was the only collegiate player to be chosen for the Dream Team that won Olympic gold in Barcelona,[17] while Krzyzewski was an assistant coach under Chuck Daly of the Detroit Pistons in a precursor to his becoming Team USA coach in 2006 and coaching them to two gold medals. They would later meet Kentucky for another classic regional final game, but blow a 17-point second half lead in losing to the Wildcats. The Blue Devils would lose the 1994 title game to Arkansas and their \"Forty Minutes of Hell\" defense. The next two seasons would see them fall to just 31â31, though they made the 1996 tournament with an 18â12 record, 8â8 in conference play.[18] They would also fall in the 1999 title game, this time to Jim Calhoun and the UConn Huskies. Duke defeated Arizona 82â72 to win its third NCAA Championship in 2001, becoming one of a handful of teams in NCAA Tournament history to defeat all of their tournament opponents by double digits. Krzyzewski was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame later that year. On April 5, 2010, Duke Men's Basketball won their fourth NCAA Championship by defeating Butler 61â59.[19] On April 6, 2015, Duke's Men's Basketball won their fifth NCAA Championship by defeating Wisconsin 68â63.[20] Coach K announced that the 2021â22 season would be his last coaching for Duke.[21] Making it to the Final Four one last time, Duke fell just short of the championship game losing to the North Carolina Tar Heels 81â77 in the first ever meeting between the rivals in the NCAA Tournament. On June 2, 2022, Scheyer was named as the new head coach at Duke following Krzyzewski's retirement.[22] On March 11, 2023, he became the first person to win an ACC tournament title as both a coach and a player. Former Duke stars such as Jim Spanarkel, Gene Banks, Alaa Abdelnaby, Johnny Dawkins, Cherokee Parks, Bobby Hurley, Antonio Lang, Roshown McLeod, William Avery, Trajan Langdon, Grant Hill, Danny Ferry, Christian Laettner, Kenny Dennard, Brian Davis, Elton Brand, Shane Battier, Carlos Boozer, Chris Duhon, Mike Dunleavy Jr., Dahntay Jones, Daniel Ewing, JJ Redick, Shavlik Randolph, Shelden Williams, Corey Maggette, Luol Deng, Josh McRoberts, Gerald Henderson, Andre Dawkins, Austin Rivers, Lance Thomas, Kyle Singler, Miles Plumlee, Mason Plumlee, Marshall Plumlee, Bob Verga, Quinn Cook, Nolan Smith, Jason Williams, Jabari Parker, Rodney Hood, Seth Curry, Kyrie Irving, Matt Jones, Amile Jefferson, Jahlil Okafor, Tyus Jones, Justise Winslow, Grayson Allen, Brandon Ingram, Luke Kennard, Jayson Tatum, Harry Giles, Frank Jackson, Gary Trent Jr., Trevon Duval, Marvin Bagley III, Wendell Carter Jr., RJ Barrett, Marques Bolden, Cam Reddish, Zion Williamson, Tre Jones, Vernon Carey Jr., Cassius Stanley, Jalen Johnson, Paolo Banchero, Mark Williams, Wendell Moore Jr., Trevor Keels, AJ Griffin and Dereck Lively II have gone on to play in the NBA.[23] Many of Krzyzewski's assistants and former players, such as Tommy Amaker (Seton Hall, University of Michigan and Harvard), Bob Bender (Illinois State University and University of Washington), Chuck Swenson at William & Mary, Mike Brey (Delaware and Notre Dame), Jeff Capel (VCU, Oklahoma and Pittsburgh), Chris Collins (Northwestern), Johnny Dawkins (Stanford, UCF), Quin Snyder (Missouri, Utah Jazz, Atlanta Hawks), and Steve Wojciechowski (Marquette) have become head basketball coaches at major universities and the NBA, while Pete Gaudet is now the head coach of the India women's national basketball team. National champion Postseason invitational champion Conference regular season champion Conference regular season and conference tournament champion Division regular season champion Division regular season and conference tournament champion Conference tournament champion The NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1978 edition. The Blue Devils have appeared in the NCAA tournament 46 times. Their combined record is 122â40. The Blue Devils have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) five times. Their combined record is 5â6. As of the 2017â18 season, the Blue Devils' program record is as follows.[33] Duke has been ranked as the #1 team in the nation 235 weeks in their history. Duke had not lost a non-conference game at Cameron from 2000 until 2019, when SFASU beat Duke in overtime (85â83). Duke maintains a tradition of hosting the previous season's Division II national champion in an exhibition game each November. Cameron Indoor Stadium was completed on January 6, 1940, having cost $400,000. At the time, it was the largest gymnasium in the country south of the Palestra at the University of Pennsylvania. Originally called Duke Indoor Stadium, it was renamed for Coach Cameron on January 22, 1972.[34] The building originally included seating for 8,800, though standing room was sufficient to ensure that 12,000 could fit in on a particularly busy day. Then, as now, Duke students were allowed a large chunk of the seats, including those directly alongside the court. Renovations in 1987â1988 removed the standing room areas and added seats, bringing capacity to 9,314. Duke's men's basketball teams have had a decided home-court advantage for many years, thanks to the diehard students known as the Cameron Crazies.[35] The hardwood floor has been dedicated and renamed Coach K Court in honor of head coach Mike Krzyzewski, and the tent city outside Cameron where students camp out before big games is known as Krzyzewskiville. In 1999, Sports Illustrated ranked Cameron the fourth best venue in all of professional and college sports,[36] and USA Today referred to it as \"the toughest road game in the nation\".[37] (since 2005) The following 78 McDonald's All-Americans have signed and played for Duke.[67] As of October 7, 2024, these former Blue Devils players were in the NBA: The DukeâNorth Carolina rivalry is often ranked among the top rivalries in both college basketball and all North American sports.[103] Entering the 2023 - 2024 season, North Carolina leads the rivalry, winning 141 games to Duke's 115.[104] The Duke Blue Devils face the North Carolina Tar Heels twice each year during ACC play, with thousands of Duke undergraduate students participating in an annual tradition of camping out in Krzyzewskiville, a lawn in front of Cameron Indoor Stadium, for months to line up for admission into the rivalry game.[105] The two teams always face each other for their last game of the regular season, with the home team hosting their Senior Night. Some years, the two teams meet for a third game in the ACC tournament. The teams have met twice in post-season tournament play. In 2022, the two schools met in the Final Four to face each other in the NCAA Tournament for the first time. In that game, the Tar Heels defeated the Blue Devils 81â77. In 1971 the two rivals met in the semi-finals of the NIT, a game also won by North Carolina by a score of 73 - 69. Duke also has rivalries with NC State and Wake Forest, and together with UNC, the 4 schools form Tobacco Road. Duke and North Carolina have combined for 11 national championships, with North Carolina leading Duke 6â5. The intensity of the rivalry is augmented by the proximity of the two universities, located only ten miles apart along U.S. Highway 15â501 (also known as Tobacco Road) or eight miles apart in straight-line distance in the cities of Durham and Chapel Hill.[106][107] In addition, Duke is a private university whereas North Carolina is a public school; the vastly different funding structures and cultures between the two further contribute to the intensity of the rivalry.[108] Former Esquire editor and author (and North Carolina graduate) Will Blythe argues that the rivalry's passion can be attributed greatly to class and culture in the South. To legions of otherwise reasonable adults, it is a conflict that surpasses sports; it is locals against outsiders, elitists against populists, even good against evil... The rivalry may be a way of aligning oneself with larger philosophic ideals â of choosing teams in life â a tradition of partisanship that reveals the pleasures and even the necessity of hatred.[109] The rivalry has been the subject of various books and articles, including To Hate Like This Is to Be Happy Forever by Blythe and Blue Blood by Art Chansky.[110] Further illustrating the intensity of the rivalry, U.S. Representative Brad Miller, a die-hard Carolina fan, told an Associated Press writer in 2012, \"I have said very publicly that if Duke was playing against the Taliban, then I'd have to pull for the Taliban.\"[111] However, also due to the close proximity of the two schools, there is respect and collaboration within the rivalry. Inspired by the men's basketball teams, twenty-four students from the two schools got together from January 14â16, 2006 in order to attempt to break the world record for the longest continuous game of basketball ever recorded. The game set a new world record at 57 hours, 17 minutes and 41 seconds with Duke winning the game 3699â3444. All $60,000 raised from the marathon benefited the Hoop Dreams Basketball Academy, an organization which helps children with life-threatening illnesses develop successful life skills through basketball.[112] Beyond athletics, the school papers have also engaged in the rivalry. As a tradition, one day prior to a Duke-North Carolina basketball game, The Chronicle, Duke's student newspaper, publishes a spoof cover page for the day's edition with the title The Daily Tar Hole. Contained within are satirical stories poking fun at The Daily Tar Heel and the North Carolina Tar Heels. The Daily Tar Heel typically publishes former columnist Ian Williams' \"Insider's guide to hating Duke\" for the two basketball match-ups each year. There is a longstanding agreement that if Duke wins the first matchup, The Daily Tar Heel's masthead is printed in Duke blue, and if North Carolina wins the first matchup, The Chronicle's masthead is painted Carolina blue. The losing school's paper also has to put the other school's logo in a conspicuous location and claim that the winning school is \"still the best.\"[113] The Michigan Wolverines and the Maryland Terrapins basketball teams have also claimed rivalries against the Blue Devils, but Duke has long rejected both claims and considers North Carolina to be its only rival.[114][115] The Duke men's basketball team has been noted as a particularly hated team within the sport. Some of the hate comes from fans of rival teams, most notably the North Carolina Tar Heels.[116] The hate is often tied to Duke's record, as the team has experienced success in most seasons since the late 1980s. The hate is often tied to specific players. Christian Laettner, who played for Duke from 1988 to 1992 as they won two national championships, is often named as one of the most hated players in college basketball.[117][118] The 2015 documentary I Hate Christian Laettner names five main reasons for the hate: \"privilege, race, bully, greatness and looks\".[119] JJ Redick, who played at Duke from 2002 to 2006 also experienced hatred and animosity from fans during his tenure.[120] Another particularly hated player is Grayson Allen, who played for Duke from 2014 to 2018. In addition to many of the reasons Laettner was hated, Allen was also targeted after several incidents in which he deliberately tripped opposing players.[121] Duke has 10 victories over the AP number one ranked team.",

As Duke menâs basketball prepares to take on a resurgent SMU squad, the Blue Zone previews the encounter with an overview and X-Factor. How has Flaggâs impact translated into advanced statistics? Specifically, how has he performed as a shooter, and which lineups have been the best for Dukeâs young star? Prior to Tuesday nightâs game, the Blue Devils have been on a bit of a slow streak to start games. While Duke has won seven straight games dating back to the late November matchup against Seattle, the Blue Devil squad has needed time to thaw out in the first period. However, the team seems to do so much more quickly when more pressure is applied. Coming off 10 days of rest, Duke menâs basketball is back. At home for the holidays, the Blue Devils cruised to a 88-65 victory over Virginia Tech, with Cooper Flagg gifting 24 points and six assists. No. 4 Duke menâs basketball returns from a 10-day hiatus to take on Virginia Tech in Cameron Indoor Stadium. After 20 minutes of play, the Blue Devils hold a 37-27 lead. He has impacted Dukeâs offense in myriad ways. He is second on the team with 3.1 assists per game, a testament to his vision. Knueppel rarely gives the ball away; his 4.67 assist-to-turnover ratio over the past five games is off the charts, good for the 99th percentile in the country. At No. 3: In head coach Jon Scheyerâs second year at the helm, the Blue Devils advanced to the Elite Eight after three impressive victories against Vermont, James Madison and Houston. As the fourth-ranked Blue Devils prepare to take on the rest of their season, our menâs basketball beats are here with questions and updates about their performances. With the NFL Playoffs right around the corner and the NBA season in full swing, several former Duke athletes are making their presence known across various professional sports leagues. The Blue Zone is here to break down their recent performances. Duke menâs basketball returns to Cameron Indoor Stadium for a conference game against Virginia Tech. The Blue Zone previews the New Yearâs Eve contest with an overview and three keys. To cap off the best recruiting class in the country, Duke got a big commitment from Cooper Flagg, the No. 1 prospect. Flagg chose the Blue Devils over UConn and Kansas, among other schools. He has performed as advertised to start, leading his team in points, rebounds and assists. In honor of Dukeâs Centennial, the Blue Zoneâs Blast from the Past series highlights pivotal figures and events in Duke sports history. Next, we look at a storybook moment for the 1997-1998 men's basketball team. As winter sports are underway, The Chronicle is back with our breakdown of every sport, including key rules, terminology, tournament formats and more. Here is our basketball edition, including a section on the common cheers for Duke's home fans. Thatâs what Duke gave star freshman Cooper Flagg for his 18th birthday down in the Peach State, controlling the game nearly the entire way en route to its second conference win, a 82-56 mark over Georgia Tech. Flagg himself added 13 points and four rebounds to aid the effort. Duke menâs basketball continues its conference slate with a road game against Georgia Tech. The Blue Zone previews Saturday's contest with an overview and X-factors. The ability to rely on defense to do the heavy lifting on a night where the offense was not at its best is a strong indicator of future success. It goes to show that the Blue Devils can find a way to win even when their shots arenât falling, a quality that is critical to making a deep run in March. In its last home nonconference matchup, No. 5 Duke was tested from wire-to-wire by a stout George Mason defense. But in the end, the Blue Devils prevailed 68-47 behind a strong offensive start to the second half and a consistently stifling unit on the other end of the floor. No. 5 Duke menâs basketball returned to action with a home contest against George Mason. After 20 minutes of play, the Blue Devils hold a 25-16 lead in a low-scoring matchup. Duke menâs basketball prepares to take on George Mason at home Tuesday. The Chronicle previews the game with an overview and three keys.",

                "title": "\n    America's final salute to Jimmy Carter begins in home state of Georgia - CBS News",
                "content": "Watch CBS News By Caroline Linton, Lucia Suarez Sang Updated on: January 4, 2025 / 7:50 PM EST / CBS News America's final salute for former President Jimmy Carter began Saturday with a solemn tribute to the 39th president outside his family's farm as the old farm bell rang 39 times in his honor. Carter died on Dec. 29 at the age of 100. He served in the U.S. Navy for seven years before working on the family farm and running for office in Georgia, winning the governorship in 1970. Carter, a Democrat, was elected to the White House in 1976 and served a single term. \"We will have many opportunities to pay tribute to my grandfather,\" said Jason Carter, the former president's grandson and chair of the Carter Center, during a service in Atlanta. In his life post-presidency, Carter continued to pursue his passion for humanitarian work and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his decades of efforts in advancing international peace, democracy and human rights. \"For us, in my family, we just knew him as a grandfather â¦ and we've shared him with the country and the world in certain ways,\" Jason Carter, his grandson and chair of the Carter Center's board, told \"CBS Mornings\" on Friday. \"I think people really connect with him because he was always just a regular guy.\" \"This is somebody from a small town in south Georgia who was a peanut farmer who ultimately became the president of the United States. It's a pretty remarkable American story,\" he added. The former president's six-day state funeral started in Americus at the Phoebe Sumter Medical Center, where current and former Secret Service agents who protected the late president loaded his remains into a black hearse and walked alongside as it rolled off the campus toward Plains. In Plains, where Carter was born on Oct. 1, 1924, and lived most of his life, mourners lined the main street. \"We want to pay our respects,\" 12-year-old Will Porter Shelbrock, who was born more than three decades after Carter left the White House in 1981, told the Associated Press. \"He was ahead of his time on what he tried to do and tried to accomplish.\" The motorcade paused briefly in front of the farm where he grew up, and the National Park Service rang a bell 39 times in his honor, in recognition of his status as the nation's 39th president. The motorcade traveled to the state capitol in Atlanta, where there was a moment of silence led by Gov. Brian Kemp, Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, Mayor of Atlanta Andre Dickens, members of the Georgia Legislature and Georgia State Patrol Troopers. During a service at the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and Museum in Atlanta, Jason Carter not only paid tribute to his grandfather, but to the people who worked with him to push his message of service and help to others beyond U.S. borders. \"This building is full of his lifeâ¦His spirit fills this place,\" he said. \"The reason his spirit fills this place is because of the people in this room.\" He added: \"You continue the vibrant living legacy of what is my grandfather's life's work.\" The president's son, James \"Chip\" Carter, paid tribute to his late father and mother, Rosalynn Carter, who died in November 2023. \"The two of them together changed the world,\" he said, his voice cracking. \"It was an amazing thing to watch from so close.\" The service on Saturday also included a psalm reading by Tony Lowden, the former president's personal pastor, a prayer by Bernstine Hollis, a longtime friend and employee at the Carter Center, as well as music by the Morehouse College Glee Club. Carter's body will lie in repose at the Carter Center until 6 a.m. on Tuesday. A departure ceremony will be held, and then his casket will be transported to Washington, D.C., where he will be transferred to a hearse with an arrival ceremony. The motorcade will stop at the U.S. Navy Memorial and then the casket will be transferred from a hearse to a horse-drawn caisson with ceremony. The funeral procession will then head to the U.S. Capitol, where military bearers will carry the casket to the Rotunda. Members of Congress can pay their respects during a ceremony, and then Carter will lie in state while the military maintains a guard of honor. Members of the public will have an opportunity to pay their respects. Carter will lie in state in the Rotunda until Thursday when there will be a state funeral at the Washington National Cathedral.

                "content": "Saturday marks the start of late President Jimmy Carter's six-day state funeral, beginning with a motorcade carrying his casket through several significant and memorable locations in his home state of Georgia. Carter died last Sunday at his home in Plains, Georgia, at the age of 100. He was the longest-living president in U.S. history. He is survived by his children, Jack, Chip, Jeff, and Amy, 11 grandchildren, and 14 great-grandchildren. His wife, former first lady Rosalynn Carter, passed away in November 2023. She was buried in Plains where Carter will rest in peace next to her. He will be remembered and celebrated at a series of different events both in Georgia and the country's capital, Washington, D.C. The White House has announced that Carter will be honored with a National Day of Mourning on January 9, the final day of services, in continuation of the tradition of recognizing former presidents' deaths. On Saturday morning, around 10:15 a.m. ET the state funeral commenced as members of the Carter family arrived at Phoebe Sumter Medical Center in Americus, Georgia. The late president's remains were carried into the hearse and a motorcade proceeded through Plains and briefly stopped at his family's farm in Archery, Georgia. There, the National Park Service commemorated Carter's life with a salute and rang the farm's bell 39 times. Carter was the 39th president of the United States. His motorcade then continued on to Georgia's State Capitol, which is about 160 miles north, where the procession stoppedfor a moment of silence at 3 p.m. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, along with other state legislators and State Patrol troopers, led the moment. A photo of a person outside Carter's family farm shows them holding signs in honor of Carter's life. President Joe Biden said in a December 29 statement: \"I do further appoint January 9, 2025, as a National Day of Mourning throughout the United States. I call on the American people to assemble on that day in their respective places of worship, there to pay homage to the memory of President James Earl Carter, Jr. I invite the people of the world who share our grief to join us in this solemn observance.\" President-elect Donald Trump on Truth Social on December 29: \"The challenges Jimmy faced as President came at a pivotal time for our country and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans,\" he posted on Truth Social. \"For that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude. Melania and I are thinking warmly of the Carter Family and their loved ones during this difficult time. We urge everyone to keep them in their hearts and prayers.\" Georgia Governor Brian Kemp said in a December 29 statement: \"As the only American president thus far to come from Georgia, he showed the world the impact our state and its people have on the country. And as a son of Plains, he always valued Georgians and the virtues of our state, choosing to return to his rural home after his time in public office.\" Following the moment of silence at the State Capitol, the motorcade transported Carter to the Carter Presidential Center at 3:45 p.m. for an arrival ceremony, with a private service to be held in the lobby of the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and Museum at 4 p.m. The service began with a performance by the Morehouse College Glee Club, followed by speeches from several family members as well as prayers. From 7 p.m. onwards, the late president will then lay in repose \"for mourners to come and pay their respects continuously until 6 a.m. on Tuesday, January 7,\" the Carter tribute website states. On Tuesday morning, Carter will be transported to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Special Air Mission 39. In the afternoon, the family and Carter's remains will then travel via motorcade to the U.S. Navy Memorial. For the following procession to the U.S. Capitol, Carter will be transported by a horse-drawn ceremonial wagon and then carried into the Capitol Rotunda. He will lie in state there from 7 p.m. on Tuesday, January 7 until early Thursday, January 9. The public is allowed to pay their respects during that time. On Thursday, January 9, he will be transported to the Washington National Cathedral for funeral services at 10 a.m. The last presidential state funeral was held in 2018 for former President George H.W. Bush, who died from a form of Parkinson's disease at age 94. His funeral took place at the Washington National Cathedral, which has hosted four state funerals. Following the funeral, he will return to Georgia and a private funeral service will take place prior to the private interment.
