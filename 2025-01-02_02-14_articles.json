                "content": "The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a massive, nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy from its surface mainly as visible light and infrared radiation with 10% at ultraviolet energies. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. The Sun has been an object of veneration in many cultures. It has been a central subject for astronomical research since antiquity. The Sun orbits the Galactic Center at a distance of 24,000 to 28,000 light-years. From Earth, it is 1 astronomical unit (1.496√ó108 km) or about 8 light-minutes away. Its diameter is about 1,391,400 km (864,600 mi), 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, making up about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. Roughly three-quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V), informally called a yellow dwarf, though its light is actually white. It formed approximately 4.6 billion[a] years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. Every second, the Sun's core fuses about 600 billion kilograms (kg) of hydrogen into helium and converts 4 billion kg of matter into energy. About 4 to 7 billion years from now, when hydrogen fusion in the Sun's core diminishes to the point where the Sun is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, its core will undergo a marked increase in density and temperature which will cause its outer layers to expand, eventually transforming the Sun into a red giant. This process will make the Sun large enough to render Earth uninhabitable approximately five billion years from the present. After the red giant phase, models suggest the Sun will shed its outer layers and become a dense type of cooling star (a white dwarf), and no longer produce energy by fusion, but will still glow and give off heat from its previous fusion for perhaps trillions of years. After that, it is theorized to become a super dense black dwarf, giving off negligible energy. The English word sun developed from Old English sunne. Cognates appear in other Germanic languages, including West Frisian sinne, Dutch zon, Low German S√ºnn, Standard German Sonne, Bavarian Sunna, Old Norse sunna, and Gothic sunn≈ç. All these words stem from Proto-Germanic *sunn≈çn.[17][18] This is ultimately related to the word for sun in other branches of the Indo-European language family, though in most cases a nominative stem with an l is found, rather than the genitive stem in n, as for example in Latin s≈çl, ancient Greek ·º•ŒªŒπŒøœÇ (hƒìlios), Welsh haul and Czech slunce, as well as (with *l > r) Sanskrit ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç (sv√°r) and Persian ÿÆŸàÿ± (xvar). Indeed, the l-stem survived in Proto-Germanic as well, as *s≈çwelan, which gave rise to Gothic sauil (alongside sunn≈ç) and Old Norse prosaic s√≥l (alongside poetic sunna), and through it the words for sun in the modern Scandinavian languages: Swedish and Danish sol, Icelandic s√≥l, etc.[18] The principal adjectives for the Sun in English are sunny for sunlight and, in technical contexts, solar (/Ààso äl…ôr/),[3] from Latin sol.[19] From the Greek helios comes the rare adjective heliac (/ÀàhiÀêli√¶k/).[20] In English, the Greek and Latin words occur in poetry as personifications of the Sun, Helios (/ÀàhiÀêli…ôs/) and Sol (/Ààs…íl/),[2][1] while in science fiction Sol may be used to distinguish the Sun from other stars. The term sol with a lowercase s is used by planetary astronomers for the duration of a solar day on another planet such as Mars.[21] The astronomical symbol for the Sun is a circle with a center dot, .[22] It is used for such units as M‚òâ (Solar mass), R‚òâ (Solar radius) and L‚òâ (Solar luminosity).[23][24] The scientific study of the Sun is called heliology.[25] The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star that makes up about 99.86% of the mass of the Solar System.[26] It has an absolute magnitude of +4.83, estimated to be brighter than about 85% of the stars in the Milky Way, most of which are red dwarfs.[27][28] It is more massive than 95% of the stars within 7 pc (23 ly).[29] The Sun is a Population I, or heavy-element-rich,[b] star.[30] Its formation approximately 4.6 billion years ago may have been triggered by shockwaves from one or more nearby supernovae.[31][32] This is suggested by a high abundance of heavy elements in the Solar System, such as gold and uranium, relative to the abundances of these elements in so-called Population II, heavy-element-poor, stars. The heavy elements could most plausibly have been produced by endothermic nuclear reactions during a supernova, or by transmutation through neutron absorption within a massive second-generation star.[30] The Sun is by far the brightest object in the Earth's sky, with an apparent magnitude of ‚àí26.74.[33][34] This is about 13 billion times brighter than the next brightest star, Sirius, which has an apparent magnitude of ‚àí1.46.[35] One astronomical unit (about 150 million kilometres; 93 million miles) is defined as the mean distance between the centers of the Sun and the Earth. The instantaneous distance varies by about ¬±2.5 million kilometres (1.6 million miles) as Earth moves from perihelion around 3 January to aphelion around 4 July.[36] At its average distance, light travels from the Sun's horizon to Earth's horizon in about 8 minutes and 20 seconds,[37] while light from the closest points of the Sun and Earth takes about two seconds less. The energy of this sunlight supports almost all life[c] on Earth by photosynthesis,[38] and drives Earth's climate and weather.[39] The Sun does not have a definite boundary, but its density decreases exponentially with increasing height above the photosphere.[40] For the purpose of measurement, the Sun's radius is considered to be the distance from its center to the edge of the photosphere, the apparent visible surface of the Sun.[41] The roundness of the Sun is relative difference between its radius at its equator, R eq {\\displaystyle R_{\\textrm {eq}}} , and at its pole, R pol {\\displaystyle R_{\\textrm {pol}}} , called the oblateness,[42] Œî ‚äô = ( R eq ‚àí R pol ) / R pol . {\\displaystyle \\Delta _{\\odot }=(R_{\\textrm {eq}}-R_{\\textrm {pol}})/R_{\\textrm {pol}}.} The value is difficult to measure. Atmospheric distortion means the measurement must be done on satellites; the value is very small meaning very precise technique is needed.[43] The oblateness was once proposed to be sufficient to explain the perihelion precession of Mercury but Einstein proposed that general relativity could explain the precession using a spherical Sun.[43] When high precision measurements of the oblateness became available via the Solar Dynamics Observatory[44] and the Picard satellite[42] the measured value was even smaller than expected,[43] 8.2 x 10-6, or 8 parts per million. This makes the Sun the natural object closest to a perfect sphere.[45] The oblateness value remains constant independent of solar irradiation changes.[42] The tidal effect of the planets is weak and does not significantly affect the shape of the Sun.[46] The Sun rotates faster at its equator than at its poles. This differential rotation is caused by convective motion due to heat transport and the Coriolis force due to the Sun's rotation. In a frame of reference defined by the stars, the rotational period is approximately 25.6 days at the equator and 33.5 days at the poles. Viewed from Earth as it orbits the Sun, the apparent rotational period of the Sun at its equator is about 28 days.[47] Viewed from a vantage point above its north pole, the Sun rotates counterclockwise around its axis of spin.[d][48] A survey of solar analogs suggest the early Sun was rotating up to ten times faster than it does today. This would have made the surface much more active, with greater X-ray and UV emission. Sun spots would have covered 5‚Äì30% of the surface.[49] The rotation rate was gradually slowed by magnetic braking, as the Sun's magnetic field interacted with the outflowing solar wind.[50] A vestige of this rapid primordial rotation still survives at the Sun's core, which has been found to be rotating at a rate of once per week; four times the mean surface rotation rate.[51][52] The Sun consists mainly of the elements hydrogen and helium. At this time in the Sun's life, they account for 74.9% and 23.8%, respectively, of the mass of the Sun in the photosphere.[53] All heavier elements, called metals in astronomy, account for less than 2% of the mass, with oxygen (roughly 1% of the Sun's mass), carbon (0.3%), neon (0.2%), and iron (0.2%) being the most abundant.[54] The Sun's original chemical composition was inherited from the interstellar medium out of which it formed. Originally it would have been about 71.1% hydrogen, 27.4% helium, and 1.5% heavier elements.[53] The hydrogen and most of the helium in the Sun would have been produced by Big Bang nucleosynthesis in the first 20 minutes of the universe, and the heavier elements were produced by previous generations of stars before the Sun was formed, and spread into the interstellar medium during the final stages of stellar life and by events such as supernovae.[55] Since the Sun formed, the main fusion process has involved fusing hydrogen into helium. Over the past 4.6 billion years, the amount of helium and its location within the Sun has gradually changed. The proportion of helium within the core has increased from about 24% to about 60% due to fusion, and some of the helium and heavy elements have settled from the photosphere toward the center of the Sun because of gravity. The proportions of heavier elements are unchanged. Heat is transferred outward from the Sun's core by radiation rather than by convection (see Radiative zone below), so the fusion products are not lifted outward by heat; they remain in the core,[56] and gradually an inner core of helium has begun to form that cannot be fused because presently the Sun's core is not hot or dense enough to fuse helium. In the current photosphere, the helium fraction is reduced, and the metallicity is only 84% of what it was in the protostellar phase (before nuclear fusion in the core started). In the future, helium will continue to accumulate in the core, and in about 5 billion years this gradual build-up will eventually cause the Sun to exit the main sequence and become a red giant.[57] The chemical composition of the photosphere is normally considered representative of the composition of the primordial Solar System.[58] Typically, the solar heavy-element abundances described above are measured both by using spectroscopy of the Sun's photosphere and by measuring abundances in meteorites that have never been heated to melting temperatures. These meteorites are thought to retain the composition of the protostellar Sun and are thus not affected by the settling of heavy elements. The two methods generally agree well.[59] The core of the Sun extends from the center to about 20‚Äì25% of the solar radius.[60] It has a density of up to 150 g/cm3[61][62] (about 150 times the density of water) and a temperature of close to 15.7 million kelvin (K).[62] By contrast, the Sun's surface temperature is about 5800 K. Recent analysis of SOHO mission data favors the idea that the core is rotating faster than the radiative zone outside it.[60] Through most of the Sun's life, energy has been produced by nuclear fusion in the core region through the proton‚Äìproton chain; this process converts hydrogen into helium.[63] Currently, 0.8% of the energy generated in the Sun comes from another sequence of fusion reactions called the CNO cycle; the proportion coming from the CNO cycle is expected to increase as the Sun becomes older and more luminous.[64][65] The core is the only region of the Sun that produces an appreciable amount of thermal energy through fusion; 99% of the Sun's power is generated in the innermost 24% of its radius, and almost no fusion occurs beyond 30% of the radius. The rest of the Sun is heated by this energy as it is transferred outward through many successive layers, finally to the solar photosphere where it escapes into space through radiation (photons) or advection (massive particles).[66][67] The proton‚Äìproton chain occurs around 9.2√ó1037 times each second in the core, converting about 3.7√ó1038 protons into alpha particles (helium nuclei) every second (out of a total of ~8.9√ó1056 free protons in the Sun), or about 6.2√ó1011 kg/s. However, each proton (on average) takes around 9 billion years to fuse with another using the PP chain.[66] Fusing four free protons (hydrogen nuclei) into a single alpha particle (helium nucleus) releases around 0.7% of the fused mass as energy,[68] so the Sun releases energy at the mass‚Äìenergy conversion rate of 4.26 billion kg/s (which requires 600 billion kg of hydrogen[69]), for 384.6 yottawatts (3.846√ó1026 W),[5] or 9.192√ó1010 megatons of TNT per second. The large power output of the Sun is mainly due to the huge size and density of its core (compared to Earth and objects on Earth), with only a fairly small amount of power being generated per cubic metre. Theoretical models of the Sun's interior indicate a maximum power density, or energy production, of approximately 276.5 watts per cubic metre at the center of the core,[70] which, according to Karl Kruszelnicki, is about the same power density inside a compost pile.[71] The fusion rate in the core is in a self-correcting equilibrium: a slightly higher rate of fusion would cause the core to heat up more and expand slightly against the weight of the outer layers, reducing the density and hence the fusion rate and correcting the perturbation; and a slightly lower rate would cause the core to cool and shrink slightly, increasing the density and increasing the fusion rate and again reverting it to its present rate.[72][73] The radiative zone is the thickest layer of the Sun, at 0.45 solar radii. From the core out to about 0.7 solar radii, thermal radiation is the primary means of energy transfer.[74] The temperature drops from approximately 7 million to 2 million kelvins with increasing distance from the core.[62] This temperature gradient is less than the value of the adiabatic lapse rate and hence cannot drive convection, which explains why the transfer of energy through this zone is by radiation instead of thermal convection.[62] Ions of hydrogen and helium emit photons, which travel only a brief distance before being reabsorbed by other ions.[74] The density drops a hundredfold (from 20,000 kg/m3 to 200 kg/m3) between 0.25 solar radii and 0.7 radii, the top of the radiative zone.[74] The radiative zone and the convective zone are separated by a transition layer, the tachocline. This is a region where the sharp regime change between the uniform rotation of the radiative zone and the differential rotation of the convection zone results in a large shear between the two‚Äîa condition where successive horizontal layers slide past one another.[75] Presently, it is hypothesized that a magnetic dynamo, or solar dynamo, within this layer generates the Sun's magnetic field.[62] The Sun's convection zone extends from 0.7 solar radii (500,000 km) to near the surface. In this layer, the solar plasma is not dense or hot enough to transfer the heat energy of the interior outward via radiation. Instead, the density of the plasma is low enough to allow convective currents to develop and move the Sun's energy outward towards its surface. Material heated at the tachocline picks up heat and expands, thereby reducing its density and allowing it to rise. As a result, an orderly motion of the mass develops into thermal cells that carry most of the heat outward to the Sun's photosphere above. Once the material diffusively and radiatively cools just beneath the photospheric surface, its density increases, and it sinks to the base of the convection zone, where it again picks up heat from the top of the radiative zone and the convective cycle continues. At the photosphere, the temperature has dropped 350-fold to 5,700 K (9,800 ¬∞F) and the density to only 0.2 g/m3 (about 1/10,000 the density of air at sea level, and 1 millionth that of the inner layer of the convective zone).[62] The thermal columns of the convection zone form an imprint on the surface of the Sun giving it a granular appearance called the solar granulation at the smallest scale and supergranulation at larger scales. Turbulent convection in this outer part of the solar interior sustains \"small-scale\" dynamo action over the near-surface volume of the Sun.[62] The Sun's thermal columns are B√©nard cells and take the shape of roughly hexagonal prisms.[76] The visible surface of the Sun, the photosphere, is the layer below which the Sun becomes opaque to visible light.[77] Photons produced in this layer escape the Sun through the transparent solar atmosphere above it and become solar radiation, sunlight. The change in opacity is due to the decreasing amount of H‚àí ions, which absorb visible light easily.[77] Conversely, the visible light perceived is produced as electrons react with hydrogen atoms to produce H‚àí ions.[78][79] The photosphere is tens to hundreds of kilometers thick, and is slightly less opaque than air on Earth. Because the upper part of the photosphere is cooler than the lower part, an image of the Sun appears brighter in the center than on the edge or limb of the solar disk, in a phenomenon known as limb darkening.[77] The spectrum of sunlight has approximately the spectrum of a black-body radiating at 5,772 K (9,930 ¬∞F),[12] interspersed with atomic absorption lines from the tenuous layers above the photosphere. The photosphere has a particle density of ~1023 m‚àí3 (about 0.37% of the particle number per volume of Earth's atmosphere at sea level). The photosphere is not fully ionized‚Äîthe extent of ionization is about 3%, leaving almost all of the hydrogen in atomic form.[80] The Sun's atmosphere is composed of five layers: the photosphere, the chromosphere, the transition region, the corona, and the heliosphere. The coolest layer of the Sun is a temperature minimum region extending to about 500 km above the photosphere, and has a temperature of about 4,100 K.[77] This part of the Sun is cool enough to allow for the existence of simple molecules such as carbon monoxide and water.[81] The chromosphere, transition region, and corona are much hotter than the surface of the Sun.[77] The reason is not well understood, but evidence suggests that Alfv√©n waves may have enough energy to heat the corona.[82] Above the temperature minimum layer is a layer about 2,000 km thick, dominated by a spectrum of emission and absorption lines.[77] It is called the chromosphere from the Greek root chroma, meaning color, because the chromosphere is visible as a colored flash at the beginning and end of total solar eclipses.[74] The temperature of the chromosphere increases gradually with altitude, ranging up to around 20,000 K near the top.[77] In the upper part of the chromosphere helium becomes partially ionized.[83] Above the chromosphere, in a thin (about 200 km) transition region, the temperature rises rapidly from around 20,000 K in the upper chromosphere to coronal temperatures closer to 1,000,000 K.[84] The temperature increase is facilitated by the full ionization of helium in the transition region, which significantly reduces radiative cooling of the plasma.[83] The transition region does not occur at a well-defined altitude, but forms a kind of nimbus around chromospheric features such as spicules and filaments, and is in constant, chaotic motion.[74] The transition region is not easily visible from Earth's surface, but is readily observable from space by instruments sensitive to extreme ultraviolet.[85] The corona is the next layer of the Sun. The low corona, near the surface of the Sun, has a particle density around 1015 m‚àí3 to 1016 m‚àí3.[83][e] The average temperature of the corona and solar wind is about 1,000,000‚Äì2,000,000 K; however, in the hottest regions it is 8,000,000‚Äì20,000,000 K.[84] Although no complete theory yet exists to account for the temperature of the corona, at least some of its heat is known to be from magnetic reconnection.[84][86] The corona is the extended atmosphere of the Sun, which has a volume much larger than the volume enclosed by the Sun's photosphere. A flow of plasma outward from the Sun into interplanetary space is the solar wind.[86] The heliosphere, the tenuous outermost atmosphere of the Sun, is filled with solar wind plasma and is defined to begin at the distance where the flow of the solar wind becomes superalfv√©nic‚Äîthat is, where the flow becomes faster than the speed of Alfv√©n waves,[87] at approximately 20 solar radii (0.1 AU). Turbulence and dynamic forces in the heliosphere cannot affect the shape of the solar corona within, because the information can only travel at the speed of Alfv√©n waves. The solar wind travels outward continuously through the heliosphere,[88][89] forming the solar magnetic field into a spiral shape,[86] until it impacts the heliopause more than 50 AU from the Sun. In December 2004, the Voyager 1 probe passed through a shock front that is thought to be part of the heliopause.[90] In late 2012, Voyager 1 recorded a marked increase in cosmic ray collisions and a sharp drop in lower energy particles from the solar wind, which suggested that the probe had passed through the heliopause and entered the interstellar medium,[91] and indeed did so on August 25, 2012, at approximately 122 astronomical units (18 Tm) from the Sun.[92] The heliosphere has a heliotail which stretches out behind it due to the Sun's peculiar motion through the galaxy.[93] On April 28, 2021, NASA's Parker Solar Probe encountered the specific magnetic and particle conditions at 18.8 solar radii that indicated that it penetrated the Alfv√©n surface, the boundary separating the corona from the solar wind, defined as where the coronal plasma's Alfv√©n speed and the large-scale solar wind speed are equal.[94][95] During the flyby, Parker Solar Probe passed into and out of the corona several times. This proved the predictions that the Alfv√©n critical surface is not shaped like a smooth ball, but has spikes and valleys that wrinkle its surface.[94] The Sun emits light across the visible spectrum, so its color is white, with a CIE color-space index near (0.3, 0.3), when viewed from space or when the Sun is high in the sky. The Solar radiance per wavelength peaks in the green portion of the spectrum when viewed from space.[96][97] When the Sun is very low in the sky, atmospheric scattering renders the Sun yellow, red, orange, or magenta, and in rare occasions even green or blue. Some cultures mentally picture the Sun as yellow and some even red; the cultural reasons for this are debated.[98] The Sun is classed as a G2 star,[66] meaning it is a G-type star, with 2 indicating its surface temperature is in the second range of the G class. The solar constant is the amount of power that the Sun deposits per unit area that is directly exposed to sunlight. The solar constant is equal to approximately 1,368 W/m2 (watts per square meter) at a distance of one astronomical unit (AU) from the Sun (that is, at or near Earth's orbit).[99] Sunlight on the surface of Earth is attenuated by Earth's atmosphere, so that less power arrives at the surface (closer to 1,000 W/m2) in clear conditions when the Sun is near the zenith.[100] Sunlight at the top of Earth's atmosphere is composed (by total energy) of about 50% infrared light, 40% visible light, and 10% ultraviolet light.[101] The atmosphere filters out over 70% of solar ultraviolet, especially at the shorter wavelengths.[102] Solar ultraviolet radiation ionizes Earth's dayside upper atmosphere, creating the electrically conducting ionosphere.[103] Ultraviolet light from the Sun has antiseptic properties and can be used to sanitize tools and water. This radiation causes sunburn, and has other biological effects such as the production of vitamin D and sun tanning. It is the main cause of skin cancer. Ultraviolet light is strongly attenuated by Earth's ozone layer, so that the amount of UV varies greatly with latitude and has been partially responsible for many biological adaptations, including variations in human skin color.[104] High-energy gamma ray photons initially released with fusion reactions in the core are almost immediately absorbed by the solar plasma of the radiative zone, usually after traveling only a few millimeters. Re-emission happens in a random direction and usually at slightly lower energy. With this sequence of emissions and absorptions, it takes a long time for radiation to reach the Sun's surface. Estimates of the photon travel time range between 10,000 and 170,000 years.[105] In contrast, it takes only 2.3 seconds for neutrinos, which account for about 2% of the total energy production of the Sun, to reach the surface. Because energy transport in the Sun is a process that involves photons in thermodynamic equilibrium with matter, the time scale of energy transport in the Sun is longer, on the order of 30,000,000 years. This is the time it would take the Sun to return to a stable state if the rate of energy generation in its core were suddenly changed.[106] Electron neutrinos are released by fusion reactions in the core, but, unlike photons, they rarely interact with matter, so almost all are able to escape the Sun immediately. However, measurements of the number of these neutrinos produced in the Sun are lower than theories predict by a factor of 3. In 2001, the discovery of neutrino oscillation resolved the discrepancy: the Sun emits the number of electron neutrinos predicted by the theory, but neutrino detectors were missing 2‚ÅÑ3 of them because the neutrinos had changed flavor by the time they were detected.[107] The Sun has a stellar magnetic field that varies across its surface. Its polar field is 1‚Äì2 gauss (0.0001‚Äì0.0002 T), whereas the field is typically 3,000 gauss (0.3 T) in features on the Sun called sunspots and 10‚Äì100 gauss (0.001‚Äì0.01 T) in solar prominences.[5] The magnetic field varies in time and location. The quasi-periodic 11-year solar cycle is the most prominent variation in which the number and size of sunspots waxes and wanes.[108][109][110] The solar magnetic field extends well beyond the Sun itself. The electrically conducting solar wind plasma carries the Sun's magnetic field into space, forming what is called the interplanetary magnetic field.[86] In an approximation known as ideal magnetohydrodynamics, plasma particles only move along magnetic field lines. As a result, the outward-flowing solar wind stretches the interplanetary magnetic field outward, forcing it into a roughly radial structure. For a simple dipolar solar magnetic field, with opposite hemispherical polarities on either side of the solar magnetic equator, a thin current sheet is formed in the solar wind. At great distances, the rotation of the Sun twists the dipolar magnetic field and corresponding current sheet into an Archimedean spiral structure called the Parker spiral.[86] Sunspots are visible as dark patches on the Sun's photosphere and correspond to concentrations of magnetic field where convective transport of heat is inhibited from the solar interior to the surface. As a result, sunspots are slightly cooler than the surrounding photosphere, so they appear dark. At a typical solar minimum, few sunspots are visible, and occasionally none can be seen at all. Those that do appear are at high solar latitudes. As the solar cycle progresses toward its maximum, sunspots tend to form closer to the solar equator, a phenomenon known as Sp√∂rer's law. The largest sunspots can be tens of thousands of kilometers across.[111] An 11-year sunspot cycle is half of a 22-year Babcock‚ÄìLeighton dynamo cycle, which corresponds to an oscillatory exchange of energy between toroidal and poloidal solar magnetic fields. At solar-cycle maximum, the external poloidal dipolar magnetic field is near its dynamo-cycle minimum strength; but an internal toroidal quadrupolar field, generated through differential rotation within the tachocline, is near its maximum strength. At this point in the dynamo cycle, buoyant upwelling within the convective zone forces emergence of the toroidal magnetic field through the photosphere, giving rise to pairs of sunspots, roughly aligned east‚Äìwest and having footprints with opposite magnetic polarities. The magnetic polarity of sunspot pairs alternates every solar cycle, a phenomenon described by Hale's law.[112][113] During the solar cycle's declining phase, energy shifts from the internal toroidal magnetic field to the external poloidal field, and sunspots diminish in number and size. At solar-cycle minimum, the toroidal field is, correspondingly, at minimum strength, sunspots are relatively rare, and the poloidal field is at its maximum strength. With the rise of the next 11-year sunspot cycle, differential rotation shifts magnetic energy back from the poloidal to the toroidal field, but with a polarity that is opposite to the previous cycle. The process carries on continuously, and in an idealized, simplified scenario, each 11-year sunspot cycle corresponds to a change, then, in the overall polarity of the Sun's large-scale magnetic field.[114][115] The Sun's magnetic field leads to many effects that are collectively called solar activity. Solar flares and coronal mass ejections tend to occur at sunspot groups. Slowly changing high-speed streams of solar wind are emitted from coronal holes at the photospheric surface. Both coronal mass ejections and high-speed streams of solar wind carry plasma and the interplanetary magnetic field outward into the Solar System.[116] The effects of solar activity on Earth include auroras at moderate to high latitudes and the disruption of radio communications and electric power. Solar activity is thought to have played a large role in the formation and evolution of the Solar System.[117] Long-term secular change in sunspot number is thought, by some scientists, to be correlated with long-term change in solar irradiance,[118] which, in turn, might influence Earth's long-term climate.[119] The solar cycle influences space weather conditions, including those surrounding Earth. For example, in the 17th century, the solar cycle appeared to have stopped entirely for several decades; few sunspots were observed during a period known as the Maunder minimum. This coincided in time with the era of the Little Ice Age, when Europe experienced unusually cold temperatures.[120] Earlier extended minima have been discovered through analysis of tree rings and appear to have coincided with lower-than-average global temperatures.[121] The temperature of the photosphere is approximately 6,000 K, whereas the temperature of the corona reaches 1,000,000‚Äì2,000,000 K.[84] The high temperature of the corona shows that it is heated by something other than direct heat conduction from the photosphere.[86] It is thought that the energy necessary to heat the corona is provided by turbulent motion in the convection zone below the photosphere, and two main mechanisms have been proposed to explain coronal heating.[84] The first is wave heating, in which sound, gravitational or magnetohydrodynamic waves are produced by turbulence in the convection zone.[84] These waves travel upward and dissipate in the corona, depositing their energy in the ambient matter in the form of heat.[122] The other is magnetic heating, in which magnetic energy is continuously built up by photospheric motion and released through magnetic reconnection in the form of large solar flares and myriad similar but smaller events‚Äînanoflares.[123] Currently, it is unclear whether waves are an efficient heating mechanism. All waves except Alfv√©n waves have been found to dissipate or refract before reaching the corona.[124] In addition, Alfv√©n waves do not easily dissipate in the corona. Current research focus has therefore shifted towards flare heating mechanisms.[84] The Sun today is roughly halfway through the main-sequence portion of its life. It has not changed dramatically in over four billion[a] years and will remain fairly stable for about five billion more. However, after hydrogen fusion in its core has stopped, the Sun will undergo dramatic changes, both internally and externally. The Sun formed about 4.6 billion years ago from the collapse of part of a giant molecular cloud that consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium and that probably gave birth to many other stars.[125] This age is estimated using computer models of stellar evolution and through nucleocosmochronology.[13] The result is consistent with the radiometric date of the oldest Solar System material, at 4.567 billion years ago.[126][127] Studies of ancient meteorites reveal traces of stable daughter nuclei of short-lived isotopes, such as iron-60, that form only in exploding, short-lived stars. This indicates that one or more supernovae must have occurred near the location where the Sun formed. A shock wave from a nearby supernova would have triggered the formation of the Sun by compressing the matter within the molecular cloud and causing certain regions to collapse under their own gravity.[128] As one fragment of the cloud collapsed it also began to rotate due to conservation of angular momentum and heat up with the increasing pressure.[129] Much of the mass became concentrated in the center, whereas the rest flattened out into a disk that would become the planets and other Solar System bodies.[130][131] Gravity and pressure within the core of the cloud generated a lot of heat as it accumulated more matter from the surrounding disk, eventually triggering nuclear fusion.[132] The stars HD 162826 and HD 186302 share similarities with the Sun and are thus hypothesized to be its stellar siblings, formed in the same molecular cloud.[133][134] The Sun is about halfway through its main-sequence stage, during which nuclear fusion reactions in its core fuse hydrogen into helium. Each second, more than four billion kilograms of matter are converted into energy within the Sun's core, producing neutrinos and solar radiation. At this rate, the Sun has so far converted around 100 times the mass of Earth into energy, about 0.03% of the total mass of the Sun. The Sun will spend a total of approximately 10 to 11 billion years as a main-sequence star before the red giant phase of the Sun.[135] At the 8 billion year mark, the Sun will be at its hottest point according to the ESA's Gaia space observatory mission in 2022.[136] The Sun is gradually becoming hotter in its core, hotter at the surface, larger in radius, and more luminous during its time on the main sequence: since the beginning of its main sequence life, it has expanded in radius by 15% and the surface has increased in temperature from 5,620 K (9,660 ¬∞F) to 5,772 K (9,930 ¬∞F), resulting in a 48% increase in luminosity from 0.677 solar luminosities to its present-day 1.0 solar luminosity. This occurs because the helium atoms in the core have a higher mean molecular weight than the hydrogen atoms that were fused, resulting in less thermal pressure. The core is therefore shrinking, allowing the outer layers of the Sun to move closer to the center, releasing gravitational potential energy. According to the virial theorem, half of this released gravitational energy goes into heating, which leads to a gradual increase in the rate at which fusion occurs and thus an increase in the luminosity. This process speeds up as the core gradually becomes denser.[137] At present, it is increasing in brightness by about 1% every 100 million years. It will take at least 1 billion years from now to deplete liquid water from the Earth from such increase.[138] After that, the Earth will cease to be able to support complex, multicellular life and the last remaining multicellular organisms on the planet will suffer a final, complete mass extinction.[139] The Sun does not have enough mass to explode as a supernova. Instead, when it runs out of hydrogen in the core in approximately 5 billion years, core hydrogen fusion will stop, and there will be nothing to prevent the core from contracting. The release of gravitational potential energy will cause the luminosity of the Sun to increase, ending the main sequence phase and leading the Sun to expand over the next billion years: first into a subgiant, and then into a red giant.[137][140][141] The heating due to gravitational contraction will also lead to expansion of the Sun and hydrogen fusion in a shell just outside the core, where unfused hydrogen remains, contributing to the increased luminosity, which will eventually reach more than 1,000 times its present luminosity.[137] When the Sun enters its red-giant branch (RGB) phase, it will engulf (and very likely destroy) Mercury and Venus. According to a 2008 paper, Earth's orbit will have initially expanded to at most 1.5 AU (220 million km; 140 million mi) due to the Sun's loss of mass. However, Earth's orbit will then start shrinking due to tidal forces (and, eventually, drag from the lower chromosphere) so that it is engulfed by the Sun during the tip of the red-giant branch phase 7.59 billion years from now, 3.8 and 1 million years after Mercury and Venus have respectively suffered the same fate.[141] By the time the Sun reaches the tip of the red-giant branch, it will be about 256 times larger than it is today, with a radius of 1.19 AU (178 million km; 111 million mi).[141][142] The Sun will spend around a billion years in the RGB and lose around a third of its mass.[141] After the red-giant branch, the Sun has approximately 120 million years of active life left, but much happens. First, the core (full of degenerate helium) ignites violently in the helium flash; it is estimated that 6% of the core‚Äîitself 40% of the Sun's mass‚Äîwill be converted into carbon within a matter of minutes through the triple-alpha process.[143] The Sun then shrinks to around 10 times its current size and 50 times the luminosity, with a temperature a little lower than today. It will then have reached the red clump or horizontal branch, but a star of the Sun's metallicity does not evolve blueward along the horizontal branch. Instead, it just becomes moderately larger and more luminous over about 100 million years as it continues to react helium in the core.[141] When the helium is exhausted, the Sun will repeat the expansion it followed when the hydrogen in the core was exhausted. This time, however, it all happens faster, and the Sun becomes larger and more luminous. This is the asymptotic-giant-branch phase, and the Sun is alternately reacting hydrogen in a shell or helium in a deeper shell. After about 20 million years on the early asymptotic giant branch, the Sun becomes increasingly unstable, with rapid mass loss and thermal pulses that increase the size and luminosity for a few hundred years every 100,000 years or so. The thermal pulses become larger each time, with the later pulses pushing the luminosity to as much as 5,000 times the current level. Despite this, the Sun's maximum AGB radius will not be as large as its tip-RGB maximum: 179 R‚òâ, or about 0.832 AU (124.5 million km; 77.3 million mi).[141][144] Models vary depending on the rate and timing of mass loss. Models that have higher mass loss on the red-giant branch produce smaller, less luminous stars at the tip of the asymptotic giant branch, perhaps only 2,000 times the luminosity and less than 200 times the radius.[141] For the Sun, four thermal pulses are predicted before it completely loses its outer envelope and starts to make a planetary nebula.[145] The post-asymptotic-giant-branch evolution is even faster. The luminosity stays approximately constant as the temperature increases, with the ejected half of the Sun's mass becoming ionized into a planetary nebula as the exposed core reaches 30,000 K (53,500 ¬∞F), as if it is in a sort of blue loop. The final naked core, a white dwarf, will have a temperature of over 100,000 K (180,000 ¬∞F) and contain an estimated 54.05% of the Sun's present-day mass.[141] (Simulations indicate that the Sun may be among the least massive stars capable of forming a planetary nebula.[146]) The planetary nebula will disperse in about 10,000 years, but the white dwarf will survive for trillions of years before fading to a hypothetical super-dense black dwarf.[147][148][149] As such, it would give off no more energy.[150] The Sun has eight known planets orbiting it. This includes four terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars), two gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn), and two ice giants (Uranus and Neptune). The Solar System also has nine bodies generally considered as dwarf planets and some more candidates, an asteroid belt, numerous comets, and a large number of icy bodies which lie beyond the orbit of Neptune. Six of the planets and many smaller bodies also have their own natural satellites: in particular, the satellite systems of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus are in some ways like miniature versions of the Sun's system.[151] The Sun is moved by the gravitational pull of the planets. The center of the Sun moves around the Solar System barycenter, within a range from 0.1 to 2.2 solar radii. The Sun's motion around the barycenter approximately repeats every 179 years, rotated by about 30¬∞ due primarily to the synodic period of Jupiter and Saturn.[152] The Sun's gravitational field is estimated to dominate the gravitational forces of surrounding stars out to about two light-years (125,000 AU). Lower estimates for the radius of the Oort cloud, by contrast, do not place it farther than 50,000 AU.[153] Most of the mass is orbiting in the region between 3,000 and 100,000 AU.[154] The furthest known objects, such as Comet West, have aphelia around 70,000 AU from the Sun.[155] The Sun's Hill sphere with respect to the galactic nucleus, the effective range of its gravitational influence, is thought to extend up to a thousand times farther and encompasses the hypothetical Oort cloud.[156] It was calculated by G. A. Chebotarev to be 230,000 AU.[157] Within 10 light-years of the Sun there are relatively few stars, the closest being the triple star system Alpha Centauri, which is about 4.4 light-years away and may be in the Local Bubble's G-Cloud.[159] Alpha Centauri A and B are a closely tied pair of Sun-like stars, whereas the closest star to the Sun, the small red dwarf Proxima Centauri, orbits the pair at a distance of 0.2 light-years. In 2016, a potentially habitable exoplanet was found to be orbiting Proxima Centauri, called Proxima Centauri b, the closest confirmed exoplanet to the Sun.[160] The Solar System is surrounded by the Local Interstellar Cloud, although it is not clear if it is embedded in the Local Interstellar Cloud or if it lies just outside the cloud's edge.[161] Multiple other interstellar clouds exist in the region within 300 light-years of the Sun, known as the Local Bubble.[161] The latter feature is an hourglass-shaped cavity or superbubble in the interstellar medium roughly 300 light-years across. The bubble is suffused with high-temperature plasma, suggesting that it may be the product of several recent supernovae.[162] The Local Bubble is a small superbubble compared to the neighboring wider Radcliffe Wave and Split linear structures (formerly Gould Belt), each of which are some thousands of light-years in length.[163] All these structures are part of the Orion Arm, which contains most of the stars in the Milky Way that are visible to the unaided eye.[164] Groups of stars form together in star clusters, before dissolving into co-moving associations. A prominent grouping that is visible to the naked eye is the Ursa Major moving group, which is around 80 light-years away within the Local Bubble. The nearest star cluster is Hyades, which lies at the edge of the Local Bubble. The closest star-forming regions are the Corona Australis Molecular Cloud, the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex and the Taurus molecular cloud; the latter lies just beyond the Local Bubble and is part of the Radcliffe wave.[165] The Sun, taking along the whole Solar System, orbits the galaxy's center of mass at an average speed of 230 km/s (828,000 km/h) or 143 mi/s (514,000 mph),[168] taking about 220‚Äì250 million Earth years to complete a revolution (a Galactic year),[169] having done so about 20 times since the Sun's formation.[170][171] The direction of the Sun's motion, the Solar apex, is roughly in the direction of the star Vega.[172] The Milky Way is moving with respect to the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) in the direction of the constellation Hydra with a speed of 550 km/s. Since the sun is moving with respect to the galactic center in the direction of Cygnus (galactic longitude 90¬∞; latitude 0¬∞) at more than 200 km/sec, the resultant velocity with respect to the CMB is about 370 km/s in the direction of Crater or Leo (galactic latitude 264¬∞, latitude 48¬∞).[173] In many prehistoric and ancient cultures, the Sun was thought to be a solar deity or other supernatural entity.[174][175] In the early first millennium BC, Babylonian astronomers observed that the Sun's motion along the ecliptic is not uniform, though they did not know why; it is today known that this is due to the movement of Earth in an elliptic orbit, moving faster when it is nearer to the Sun at perihelion and moving slower when it is farther away at aphelion.[176] One of the first people to offer a scientific or philosophical explanation for the Sun was the Greek philosopher Anaxagoras. He reasoned that it was a giant flaming ball of metal even larger than the land of the Peloponnesus and that the Moon reflected the light of the Sun.[177] Eratosthenes estimated the distance between Earth and the Sun in the third century BC as \"of stadia myriads 400 and 80000\", the translation of which is ambiguous, implying either 4,080,000 stadia (755,000 km) or 804,000,000 stadia (148 to 153 million kilometers or 0.99 to 1.02 AU); the latter value is correct to within a few percent. In the first century AD, Ptolemy estimated the distance as 1,210 times the radius of Earth, approximately 7.71 million kilometers (0.0515 AU).[178] The theory that the Sun is the center around which the planets orbit was first proposed by the ancient Greek Aristarchus of Samos in the third century BC,[179] and later adopted by Seleucus of Seleucia (see Heliocentrism).[180] This view was developed in a more detailed mathematical model of a heliocentric system in the 16th century by Nicolaus Copernicus.[181] Observations of sunspots were recorded during the Han dynasty (206 BC‚ÄìAD 220) by Chinese astronomers, who maintained records of these observations for centuries. Averroes also provided a description of sunspots in the 12th century.[182] The invention of the telescope in the early 17th century permitted detailed observations of sunspots by Thomas Harriot, Galileo Galilei and other astronomers. Galileo posited that sunspots were on the surface of the Sun rather than small objects passing between Earth and the Sun.[183] Arabic astronomical contributions include Al-Battani's discovery that the direction of the Sun's apogee (the place in the Sun's orbit against the fixed stars where it seems to be moving slowest) is changing.[184] (In modern heliocentric terms, this is caused by a gradual motion of the aphelion of the Earth's orbit). Ibn Yunus observed more than 10,000 entries for the Sun's position for many years using a large astrolabe.[185] From an observation of a transit of Venus in 1032, the Persian astronomer and polymath Ibn Sina concluded that Venus was closer to Earth than the Sun.[186] In 1677, Edmond Halley observed a transit of Mercury across the Sun, leading him to realize that observations of the solar parallax of a planet (more ideally using the transit of Venus) could be used to trigonometrically determine the distances between Earth, Venus, and the Sun.[187] Careful observations of the 1769 transit of Venus allowed astronomers to calculate the average Earth‚ÄìSun distance as 93,726,900 miles (150,838,800 km), only 0.8% greater than the modern value.[188] In 1666, Isaac Newton observed the Sun's light using a prism, and showed that it is made up of light of many colors.[189] In 1800, William Herschel discovered infrared radiation beyond the red part of the solar spectrum.[190] The 19th century saw advancement in spectroscopic studies of the Sun; Joseph von Fraunhofer recorded more than 600 absorption lines in the spectrum, the strongest of which are still often referred to as Fraunhofer lines. The 20th century brought about several specialized systems for observing the Sun, especially at different narrowband wavelengths, such as those using Calcium H (396.9 nm), K (393.37 nm) and Hydrogen-alpha (656.46 nm) filtering.[191] During early studies of the optical spectrum of the photosphere, some absorption lines were found that did not correspond to any chemical elements then known on Earth. In 1868, Norman Lockyer hypothesized that these absorption lines were caused by a new element that he dubbed helium, after the Greek Sun god Helios. Twenty-five years later, helium was isolated on Earth.[192] In the early years of the modern scientific era, the source of the Sun's energy was a significant puzzle. Lord Kelvin suggested that the Sun is a gradually cooling liquid body that is radiating an internal store of heat.[193] Kelvin and Hermann von Helmholtz then proposed a gravitational contraction mechanism to explain the energy output, but the resulting age estimate was only 20 million years, well short of the time span of at least 300 million years suggested by some geological discoveries of that time.[193][194] In 1890, Lockyer proposed a meteoritic hypothesis for the formation and evolution of the Sun.[195] Not until 1904 was a documented solution offered. Ernest Rutherford suggested that the Sun's output could be maintained by an internal source of heat, and suggested radioactive decay as the source.[196] However, it would be Albert Einstein who would provide the essential clue to the source of the Sun's energy output with his mass‚Äìenergy equivalence relation E = mc2.[197] In 1920, Sir Arthur Eddington proposed that the pressures and temperatures at the core of the Sun could produce a nuclear fusion reaction that merged hydrogen (protons) into helium nuclei, resulting in a production of energy from the net change in mass.[198] The preponderance of hydrogen in the Sun was confirmed in 1925 by Cecilia Payne using the ionization theory developed by Meghnad Saha. The theoretical concept of fusion was developed in the 1930s by the astrophysicists Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar and Hans Bethe. Hans Bethe calculated the details of the two main energy-producing nuclear reactions that power the Sun.[199][200] In 1957, Margaret Burbidge, Geoffrey Burbidge, William Fowler and Fred Hoyle showed that most of the elements in the universe have been synthesized by nuclear reactions inside stars, some like the Sun.[201] The first satellites designed for long term observation of the Sun from interplanetary space were NASA's Pioneers 6, 7, 8 and 9, which were launched between 1959 and 1968. These probes orbited the Sun at a distance similar to that of Earth, and made the first detailed measurements of the solar wind and the solar magnetic field. Pioneer 9 operated for a particularly long time, transmitting data until May 1983.[202][203] In the 1970s, two Helios spacecraft and the Skylab Apollo Telescope Mount provided scientists with significant new data on solar wind and the solar corona. The Helios 1 and 2 probes were U.S.‚ÄìGerman collaborations that studied the solar wind from an orbit carrying the spacecraft inside Mercury's orbit at perihelion.[204] The Skylab space station, launched by NASA in 1973, included a solar observatory module called the Apollo Telescope Mount that was operated by astronauts resident on the station.[85] Skylab made the first time-resolved observations of the solar transition region and of ultraviolet emissions from the solar corona.[85] Discoveries included the first observations of coronal mass ejections, then called \"coronal transients\", and of coronal holes, now known to be intimately associated with the solar wind.[204] In 1980, the Solar Maximum Mission probes were launched by NASA. This spacecraft was designed to observe gamma rays, X-rays and UV radiation from solar flares during a time of high solar activity and solar luminosity. Just a few months after launch, however, an electronics failure caused the probe to go into standby mode, and it spent the next three years in this inactive state. In 1984, Space Shuttle Challenger mission STS-41C retrieved the satellite and repaired its electronics before re-releasing it into orbit. The Solar Maximum Mission subsequently acquired thousands of images of the solar corona before re-entering Earth's atmosphere in June 1989.[205] Launched in 1991, Japan's Yohkoh (Sunbeam) satellite observed solar flares at X-ray wavelengths. Mission data allowed scientists to identify several different types of flares and demonstrated that the corona away from regions of peak activity was much more dynamic and active than had previously been supposed. Yohkoh observed an entire solar cycle but went into standby mode when an annular eclipse in 2001 caused it to lose its lock on the Sun. It was destroyed by atmospheric re-entry in 2005.[206] The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, jointly built by the European Space Agency and NASA, was launched on 2 December 1995.[85] Originally intended to serve a two-year mission,[207] SOHO remains in operation as of 2024.[208] Situated at the Lagrangian point between Earth and the Sun (at which the gravitational pull from both is equal), SOHO has provided a constant view of the Sun at many wavelengths since its launch.[85] Besides its direct solar observation, SOHO has enabled the discovery of a large number of comets, mostly tiny sungrazing comets that incinerate as they pass the Sun.[209] All these satellites have observed the Sun from the plane of the ecliptic, and so have only observed its equatorial regions in detail. The Ulysses probe was launched in 1990 to study the Sun's polar regions. It first traveled to Jupiter, to \"slingshot\" into an orbit that would take it far above the plane of the ecliptic. Once Ulysses was in its scheduled orbit, it began observing the solar wind and magnetic field strength at high solar latitudes, finding that the solar wind from high latitudes was moving at about 750 km/s, which was slower than expected, and that there were large magnetic waves emerging from high latitudes that scattered galactic cosmic rays.[210] Elemental abundances in the photosphere are well known from spectroscopic studies, but the composition of the interior of the Sun is more poorly understood. A solar wind sample return mission, Genesis, was designed to allow astronomers to directly measure the composition of solar material.[211] The brightness of the Sun can cause pain from looking at it with the naked eye; however, doing so for brief periods is not hazardous for normal non-dilated eyes.[212][213] Looking directly at the Sun (sungazing) causes phosphene visual artifacts and temporary partial blindness. It also delivers about 4 milliwatts of sunlight to the retina, slightly heating it and potentially causing damage in eyes that cannot respond properly to the brightness.[214][215] Viewing of the direct Sun with the naked eye can cause UV-induced, sunburn-like lesions on the retina beginning after about 100 seconds, particularly under conditions where the UV light from the Sun is intense and well focused.[216][217] Viewing the Sun through light-concentrating optics such as binoculars may result in permanent damage to the retina without an appropriate filter that blocks UV and substantially dims the sunlight. When using an attenuating filter to view the Sun, the viewer is cautioned to use a filter specifically designed for that use. Some improvised filters that pass UV or IR rays, can actually harm the eye at high brightness levels.[218] Brief glances at the midday Sun through an unfiltered telescope can cause permanent damage.[219] During sunrise and sunset, sunlight is attenuated because of Rayleigh scattering and Mie scattering from a particularly long passage through Earth's atmosphere,[220] and the Sun is sometimes faint enough to be viewed comfortably with the naked eye or safely with optics (provided there is no risk of bright sunlight suddenly appearing through a break between clouds). Hazy conditions, atmospheric dust, and high humidity contribute to this atmospheric attenuation.[221] An optical phenomenon, known as a green flash, can sometimes be seen shortly after sunset or before sunrise. The flash is caused by light from the Sun just below the horizon being bent (usually through a temperature inversion) towards the observer. Light of shorter wavelengths (violet, blue, green) is bent more than that of longer wavelengths (yellow, orange, red) but the violet and blue light is scattered more, leaving light that is perceived as green.[222] Solar deities play a major role in many world religions and mythologies.[223] Worship of the Sun was central to civilizations such as the ancient Egyptians, the Inca of South America and the Aztecs of what is now Mexico. In religions such as Hinduism, the Sun is still considered a god, known as Surya. Many ancient monuments were constructed with solar phenomena in mind; for example, stone megaliths accurately mark the summer or winter solstice (for example in Nabta Playa, Egypt; Mnajdra, Malta; and Stonehenge, England); Newgrange, a prehistoric human-built mount in Ireland, was designed to detect the winter solstice; the pyramid of El Castillo at Chich√©n Itz√° in Mexico is designed to cast shadows in the shape of serpents climbing the pyramid at the vernal and autumnal equinoxes.[224] The ancient Sumerians believed that the Sun was Utu,[225][226] the god of justice and twin brother of Inanna, the Queen of Heaven,[225] who was identified as the planet Venus.[226] Later, Utu was identified with the East Semitic god Shamash.[225][226] Utu was regarded as a helper-deity, who aided those in distress.[225] From at least the Fourth Dynasty of Ancient Egypt, the Sun was worshipped as the god Ra, portrayed as a falcon-headed divinity surmounted by the solar disk, and surrounded by a serpent. In the New Empire period, the Sun became identified with the dung beetle. In the form of the sun disc Aten, the Sun had a brief resurgence during the Amarna Period when it again became the preeminent, if not only, divinity for the Pharaoh Akhenaton.[227][228] The Egyptians portrayed the god Ra as being carried across the sky in a solar barque, accompanied by lesser gods, and to the Greeks, he was Helios, carried by a chariot drawn by fiery horses. From the reign of Elagabalus in the late Roman Empire the Sun's birthday was a holiday celebrated as Sol Invictus (literally \"Unconquered Sun\") soon after the winter solstice, which may have been an antecedent to Christmas. Regarding the fixed stars, the Sun appears from Earth to revolve once a year along the ecliptic through the zodiac, and so Greek astronomers categorized it as one of the seven planets (Greek planetes, \"wanderer\"); the naming of the days of the weeks after the seven planets dates to the Roman era.[229][230][231] In Proto-Indo-European religion, the Sun was personified as the goddess *Seh2ul.[232][233] Derivatives of this goddess in Indo-European languages include the Old Norse S√≥l, Sanskrit Surya, Gaulish Sulis, Lithuanian Saulƒó, and Slavic Solntse.[233] In ancient Greek religion, the sun deity was the male god Helios,[234] who in later times was syncretized with Apollo.[235] In the Bible, Malachi 4:2 mentions the \"Sun of Righteousness\" (sometimes translated as the \"Sun of Justice\"),[236][237] which some Christians have interpreted as a reference to the Messiah (Christ).[238] In ancient Roman culture, Sunday was the day of the sun god. In paganism, the Sun was a source of life, giving warmth and illumination. It was the center of a popular cult among Romans, who would stand at dawn to catch the first rays of sunshine as they prayed. The celebration of the winter solstice (which influenced Christmas) was part of the Roman cult of the unconquered Sun (Sol Invictus). It was adopted as the Sabbath day by Christians. The symbol of light was a pagan device adopted by Christians, and perhaps the most important one that did not come from Jewish traditions. Christian churches were built so that the congregation faced toward the sunrise.[239] Tonatiuh, the Aztec god of the sun,[240] was closely associated with the practice of human sacrifice.[240] The sun goddess Amaterasu is the most important deity in the Shinto religion,[241][242] and she is believed to be the direct ancestor of all Japanese emperors.[241] Solar System ‚Üí Local Interstellar Cloud ‚Üí Local Bubble ‚Üí Gould Belt ‚Üí Orion Arm ‚Üí Milky Way ‚Üí Milky Way subgroup ‚Üí Local Group ‚Üí Local Sheet ‚Üí Virgo Supercluster ‚Üí Laniakea Supercluster ‚Üí Local Hole ‚Üí Observable universe ‚Üí UniverseEach arrow (‚Üí) may be read as \"within\" or \"part of\".",

                "content": "This is an accepted version of this page In the Gregorian calendar, New Year's Day is the first day of the calendar year, 1 January. Most solar calendars, such as the Gregorian and Julian calendars, begin the year regularly at or near the northern winter solstice. In contrast, cultures and religions that observe a lunisolar or lunar calendar celebrate their Lunar New Year at varying points relative to the solar year. In pre-Christian Rome, under the Julian calendar, the day was dedicated to Janus, god of gateways and beginnings, for whom January is also named. From Roman times until the mid-18th century, the new year was celebrated at various stages and in various parts of Christian Europe on 25 December, on 1 March, on 25 March and on the movable feast of Easter.[2][3][4] In the present day, with most countries now using the Gregorian calendar as their civil calendar, 1 January according to Gregorian calendar is among the most celebrated of public holidays in the world, often observed with fireworks at the stroke of midnight following New Year's Eve as the new year starts in each time zone. Other global New Year's Day traditions include making New Year's resolutions and calling one's friends and family.[1] The ancient Babylonian calendar was lunisolar, and around the year 2000 BC[5] began observing a spring festival and the new year during the month of Nisan, around the time of the March equinox. The early Roman calendar designated 1 March as the first day of the year.[6] The calendar had just 10 months, beginning with March. That the new year once began with the month of March is still reflected in some of the names of the months. September through to December, the ninth through to the twelfth months of the Gregorian calendar, were originally positioned as the seventh through to the tenth months. (Septem is Latin for \"seven\"; octo, \"eight\"; novem, \"nine\"; and decem, \"ten\") Roman mythology usually credits their second king Numa with the establishment of the two new months of Ianuarius and Februarius. These were first placed at the end of the year, but at some point came to be considered the first two months instead.[7] The January kalend (Latin: Kalendae Ianuariae), the start of the month of January, came to be celebrated as the new year at some point after it became the day for the inaugurating new consuls in 153 BC as a result of the rebellion in Hispania which began the second Celtiberian War. Romans had long dated their years by these consulships, rather than sequentially, and making the kalends of January start the new year aligned this dating. Still, private and religious celebrations around the March new year continued for some time and there is no consensus on the question of the timing for 1 January's new status.[8] Once it became the new year, however, it became a time for family gatherings and celebrations. A series of disasters, notably including the failed rebellion of M. Aemilius Lepidus in 78 BC, established a superstition against allowing Rome's market days to fall on the kalends of January and the pontiffs employed intercalation to avoid its occurrence.[9][10] The Julian calendar, proposed by Julius Caesar in 46 BC, was a reform of the Roman calendar. It took effect on 1 January 45 BC, by edict. The calendar became the predominant calendar in the Roman Empire and subsequently, most of the Western world for more than 1,600 years. The Roman calendar began the year on 1 January, and this remained the start of the year after the Julian reform. However, even after local calendars were aligned to the Julian calendar, they started the new year on different dates. The Alexandrian calendar in Egypt started on 29 August (30 August after an Alexandrian leap year). Several local provincial calendars were aligned to start on the birthday of the Emperor Augustus, 23 September. The indiction caused the Byzantine year, which used the Julian calendar, to begin on 1 September; this date is still used in the Eastern Orthodox Church for the beginning of the liturgical year. At various times and in various places throughout mediaeval Christian Europe, the new year was celebrated on 25 December in honour of the birth of Jesus; 1 March in the old Roman style; 25 March in honour of Lady Day (the Feast of the Annunciation, the date of the conception of Jesus); and on the movable feast of Easter.[2][4] As a date in the Christian calendar, New Year's Day liturgically marked the Feast of the Naming and Circumcision of Jesus, which is still observed as such in the Anglican Church, the Lutheran Church,[11][12] the Ambrosian section of the Catholicism, the Eastern Orthodox Church (Julian calendar, see below) and in Traditional Catholicism by those who retain the usage of the General Roman Calendar of 1960. The mainstream Roman Catholic Church celebrates on this day the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God.[13] Among the 7th-century pagans of Flanders and the Netherlands, it was the custom to exchange gifts at the winter solstice. This custom was deplored by Saint Eligius (died 659 or 660), who warned the Flemish and Dutch: \"(Do not) make visuals, [little figures of the Old Woman], little deer or iotticos or set tables [for the house-elf, compare Puck] at night or exchange New Year gifts or supply superfluous drinks [another Yule custom].\"[14] However, on the date that European Christians celebrated the Feast of the Circumcision, they exchanged Christmas presents because the feast fell within the 12 days of the Christmas season in the Western Christian liturgical calendar;[15] The custom of exchanging Christmas gifts in a Christian context is traced back to the Biblical Magi who gave gifts to the Christ Child.[16][17] In Tudor England, 1 January (as the Feast of the Circumcision, not New Year's Day), along with Christmas Day and Twelfth Night, was celebrated as one of three main festivities among the twelve days of Christmastide, and gift-giving was customary at the royal court.[18] Most nations of Europe and their colonies officially adopted 1 January as New Year's Day somewhat before they adopted the Gregorian calendar. Most of Germany changed to 1 January from 1544, the Netherlands did so from 1556 or 1573 according to sect, Spain and Portugal from 1556, France from 1564, Italy (pre-unification) on a variety of dates, Sweden, Norway and Denmark from 1599, Scotland from 1600,[19] and Russia from 1700 or 1725.[2] England, Wales, Ireland, and Britain's American colonies adopted 1 January as New Year's Day from 1752.[2][4] Until Tuesday, 31 December 1751[a] (except Scotland),[b] the Kingdom of Great Britain and the British Empire at the time had retained 25 March as the official start of the year, although informal use of 1 January had become common.[c] With the Calendar (New Style) Act 1750, Britain and the Empire formally adopted 1 January as New Year's Day in 1752 and, with the same Act, also discarded the Julian calendar at the end of Wednesday, 2 September of that same year (though the actions are otherwise unrelated). The Act came into effect \"following the last said day of December 1751\".[20][d] By 1750, adjustments needed to be made for an eleven-day difference between the older Julian calendar and the newer (and more accurate) Gregorian calendar. There was some religious dissent regarding feast days being moved, especially Christmas Day (see Old Christmas), and isolated communities continued the old reckoning to a greater or lesser extent. The years 1800 and 1900 were leap years in the Julian calendar but not in the Gregorian, so the difference increased to twelve days, then thirteen. The year 2000 was a leap year in both calendars. At various stages during the first half of the twentieth century, all countries in Eastern Christendom adopted the Gregorian calendar as their civil calendar but continued, and have continued into modern times, to use the Julian Calendar for ecclesiastical purposes. As 1 January (Julian) equates to 14 January (Gregorian), a religious celebration of the New Year on this date may seem strange to Western eyes. In cultures and religions that traditionally or currently use calendars other than the Gregorian, New Year's Day is often also an important celebration. Some countries concurrently use Gregorian and another calendar. New Year's Day in the alternative calendar attracts alternative celebrations of that new year: The major religions of the Middle East are Islam and Judaism: their adherents worldwide celebrate the first day of their respective new religious calendar years. The two primary sects of Islam are Sunni Islam and Shia Islam. They have different calendars though for both the epoch of the calendar is the Hijrah. According to a convention established by NASA, the Martian year begins on its Northward equinox, the spring equinox of its northern hemisphere. Its most recent New Year's Day (of MY 37) coincided with 26 December 2022 on Earth's Gregorian calendar.[31] New Year's Day of MY 38 will coincide with 12 November 2024. In the Gregorian calendar, New Year's Eve, also known as Old Year's Day, refers to the evening or the entire day of the last day of the year, 31 December. In many countries, New Year's Eve is celebrated with dancing, eating, drinking, and watching or lighting fireworks. Some Christians attend a watchnight service to mark the occasion. The celebrations generally go on past midnight into New Year's Day, 1 January. The first places to welcome the New Year are the Line Islands (part of Kiribati), Samoa and Tonga, in the Pacific Ocean. In contrast, American Samoa, Baker Island and Howland Island (part of the United States Minor Outlying Islands) are among the last.[32] The first of January represents the fresh start of a new year after a period of remembrance of the passing year, including on radio, television, and in newspapers, which starts in early December in countries around the world. Publications have year-end articles that review the changes during the previous year. In some cases, publications may set their entire year's work alight in the hope that the smoke emitted from the flame brings new life to the company. There are also articles on planned or expected changes in the coming year. This day is traditionally a religious feast, but since the 1900s has also become an occasion to celebrate the night of 31 December‚ÄîNew Year's Eve‚Äîwith parties, public celebrations (often involving fireworks shows) and other traditions focused on the impending arrival of midnight and the new year. Watchnight services are also still observed by many.[33] The celebrations and activities held worldwide on 1 January as part of New Year's Day commonly include the following: Music associated with New Year's Day comes in both classical and popular genres, and there is also Christmas song focus on the arrival of a new year during the Christmas and holiday season. A common image used, often as an editorial cartoon, is that of an incarnation of Father Time (or \"the Old Year\") wearing a sash across his chest with the previous year printed on it passing on his duties to the Baby New Year (or \"the New Year\"), an infant wearing a sash with the new year printed on it.[46] Babies born on New Year's Day are commonly called New Year babies. Hospitals, such as the Dyersburg Regional Medical Center[47] in the US, give out prizes to the first baby born in that hospital in the new year. These prizes are often donated by local businesses. Prizes may include various baby-related items such as baby formula, baby blankets, diapers, and gift certificates to stores which specialise in baby-related merchandise. On New Year's Day in Antarctica, the stake marking the geographic south pole is moved approximately 10 meters to compensate for the movement of the ice. A new marker stake is designed and made each year by staff at the site nearby. The Eastern Orthodox Church, the Anglican Church and the Lutheran Church celebrate the Feast of the Circumcision of Christ on 1 January, based on the belief that if Jesus was born on 25 December, then according to Hebrew tradition, his circumcision would have taken place on the eighth day of his life (1 January). The Roman Catholic Church celebrates on this day the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God, which is also a Holy Day of Obligation. Johann Sebastian Bach composed several church cantatas for the double occasion: (federal) = federal holidays, (abbreviation) = state/territorial holidays, (religious) = religious holidays, (cultural) = holiday related to a specific racial/ethnic group or sexual minority, (week) = week-long holidays, (month) = month-long holidays, (36) = Title 36 Observances and Ceremonies",

                "content": "The New Year is the time or day at which a new calendar year begins and the calendar's year count increments by one. Many cultures celebrate the event in some manner.[1] In the Gregorian calendar, the most widely used calendar system today, New Year occurs on January 1 (New Year's Day, preceded by New Year's Eve). This was also the first day of the year in the original Julian calendar and the Roman calendar (after 153 BC).[2] Other cultures observe their traditional or religious New Year's Day according to their own customs, typically (though not invariably) because they use a lunar calendar or a lunisolar calendar. Chinese New Year, the Islamic New Year, Tamil New Year (Puthandu), and the Jewish New Year are among well-known examples. India, Nepal, and other countries also celebrate New Year on dates according to their own calendars that are movable in the Gregorian calendar. During the Middle Ages in Western Europe, while the Julian calendar was still in use, authorities moved New Year's Day, depending upon locale, to one of several other days, including March 1, March 25, Easter, September 1, and December 25. Since then, many national civil calendars in the Western World and beyond have changed to using one fixed date for New Year's Day, January 1‚Äîmost doing so when they adopted the Gregorian calendar. Based on the used calendar new years are often categorized between lunar or lunisolar new years or solar new years. The new year of many South and Southeast Asian calendars falls between April 13‚Äì15, marking the beginning of spring. The early development of the Christian liturgical year coincided with the Roman Empire (east and west), and later the Byzantine Empire, both of which employed a taxation system labeled the Indiction, the years for which began on September 1. This timing may account for the ancient church's establishment of September 1 as the beginning of the liturgical year, despite the official Roman New Year's Day of January 1 in the Julian calendar, because the Indiction was the principal means for counting years in the empires, apart from the reigns of the Emperors. The September 1 date prevailed throughout all of Christendom for many centuries, until subsequent divisions eventually produced revisions in some places. After the sack of Rome in 410, communications and travel between east and west deteriorated. Liturgical developments in Rome and Constantinople did not always match, although a rigid adherence to form was never mandated in the church. Nevertheless, the principal points of development were maintained between east and west. The Roman and Constantinopolitan liturgical calendars remained compatible even after the East-West Schism in 1054. Separations between the Catholic General Roman Calendar and Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar grew only over several centuries' time. During those intervening centuries, the Latin Church Catholic ecclesiastic year was moved to the first day of Advent, the Sunday nearest to St. Andrew's Day (November 30). By the time of the Reformation (early 16th century), the Roman Catholic general calendar provided the initial basis for the calendars for the liturgically oriented Protestants, including the Anglican and Lutheran Churches, who inherited this observation of the liturgical new year.[citation needed] The present-day Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar is the virtual culmination of the ancient eastern development cycle, though it includes later additions based on subsequent history and lives of saints. It still begins on September 1, proceeding annually into the Nativity of the Theotokos (September 8) and Exaltation of the Cross (September 14) to the celebration of Nativity of Christ (Christmas), through his death and resurrection (Pascha/Easter), to his Ascension and the Dormition of the Theotokos (\"falling asleep\" of the Virgin Mary, August 15). This last feast is known in the Roman Catholic church as the Assumption. The dating of \"September 1\" is according to the \"new\" (revised) Julian calendar or the \"old\" (standard) Julian calendar, depending on which is used by a particular Orthodox Church. Hence, it may fall on September 1 on the civil calendar, or on September 14 (between 1900 and 2099 inclusive). The liturgical calendars of the Coptic and Ethiopian Orthodox churches are unrelated to these systems but instead follow the Alexandrian calendar which fixed the wandering ancient Egyptian calendar to the Julian year. Their New Year celebrations on Neyrouz and Enkutatash were fixed; however, at a point in the Sothic cycle close to the Indiction; between the years 1900 and 2100, they fall on September 11 during most years and September 12 in the years preceding a leap year. During the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire, years began on the date on which each consul first entered the office. This was probably May 1 before 222 BC, March 15 from 222 BC to 154 BC,[15] and January 1 from 153 BC.[16] In 45 BC, when Julius Caesar's new Julian calendar took effect, the Senate fixed January 1 as the first day of the year. At that time, this was the date on which those who were to hold civil office assumed their official position, and it was also the traditional annual date for the convening of the Roman Senate. This civil new year remained in effect throughout the Roman Empire, east and west, during its lifetime and well after, wherever the Julian calendar continued in use. In the Middle Ages in Europe a number of significant feast days in the ecclesiastical calendar of the Roman Catholic Church came to be used as the beginning of the Julian year: Over the centuries, countries changed between styles until the Modern Style (January 1) prevailed. For example, A more unusual case is France, which observed the Northern autumn equinox day (usually September 22) as \"New Year's Day\" in the French Republican Calendar, which was in use from 1793 to 1805. This was primidi Vend√©miaire, the first day of the first month. It took quite a long time before January 1 again became the universal or standard start of the civil year. The years of adoption of January 1 as the new year are as follows: March 1 was the first day of the numbered year in the Republic of Venice until its destruction in 1797,[31] and in Russia from 988 until 1492 (Anno Mundi 7000 in the Byzantine calendar).[31] September 1 was used in Russia from 1492 (A.M. 7000) until the adoption of both the Anno Domini notation and 1 January as New Year's Day, with effect from 1700, via December 1699 decrees (1735, 1736) of Tsar Peter I.[32][26] Because of the division of the globe into time zones, the new year moves progressively around the globe as the start of the day ushers in the New Year. The first time zone to usher in the New Year, just west of the International Date Line, is located in the Line Islands, a part of the nation of Kiribati, and has a time zone 14 hours ahead of UTC.[33][34][35] All other time zones are 1 to 25 hours behind, most in the previous day (December 31); on American Samoa and Midway, it is still 11 pm on December 30. These are among the last inhabited places to observe New Year. However, uninhabited outlying US territories Howland Island and Baker Island are designated as lying within the time zone 12 hours behind UTC, the last places on Earth to see the arrival of January 1. These small coral islands are found about midway between Hawaii and Australia, about 1,000 miles west of the Line Islands. This is because the International Date Line is a composite of local time zone arrangements, which winds through the Pacific Ocean, allowing each locale to remain most closely connected in time with the nearest or largest or most convenient political and economic locales with which each associate. By the time Howland Island sees the new year, it is 2 am on January 2 in the Line Islands of Kiribati.",

It is usually marked by rites and ceremonies that symbolize casting off the old year and rejoicing in the new. Most of the world recognizes January 1 as the start of a new year because the Gregorian calendar, from its papal origin in 1582, has become the international reference for treaties, corporate contracts, and other legal documents. Nevertheless, numerous religious and national calendars have been retained. For example, in the Persian calendar (used in Iran and Afghanistan) New Year‚Äôs Day falls on the spring equinox (March 20 or 21 in the Gregorian calendar). The more widely employed Islamic (Hijrƒ´) calendar is based on 12 lunar months of 29 or 30 days; thus, the Islamic New Year‚Äôs Day gradually regresses through the longer Gregorian calendar. The Hindu new year starts on the day following the first new moon on or after the spring equinox. The Chinese new year begins at sunset on the new moon in the sign of Aquarius (late January or early February).

Matching_MjMwMDQ= 'For last year's words belong to last year's languageAnd next year's words await another voice.And to make an end is to make a beginning.' ‚Äì TS Eliot There have been celebrations to mark the beginning of a new year for thousands of years. Sometimes these were simply an opportunity for people to eat, drink and have fun, but in some places the festivities were connected to the land or astronomical events. For example, in Egypt the beginning of the year coincided with when the River Nile flooded, and this normally happened when the star Sirius rose. The Persians and Phoenicians started their new year at the spring equinox (this is around 20 March when the Sun shines more or less directly on the equator and the length of the night and the day are almost the same). The city of Babylon in ancient Mesopotamia was where the first New Year's celebrations were recorded about 4,000 years ago. The Babylonians held their celebrations on the first new moon after the spring equinox and called this festival Akitu (which comes from the word the Sumerians used for barley). Barley was cut in Mesopotamia in the spring, and during Akitu there was a different ritual on each of the 11 days that the celebration lasted. Statues of the gods were carried through the streets of the city, and in this way the Babylonians believed that their world had been cleaned to prepare for the new year and a new spring. In many cities all over the world, spectacular fireworks displays take place as soon as the clock passes midnight on 31 December. In recent years, Sydney in Australia has been the host to one of the first of these celebrations as New Year arrives there before most other major international cities. The display takes place in Sydney Harbour, with the Opera House and Harbour Bridge making it a stunning setting. Fireworks light up the skies in hundreds of cities as 12 midnight strikes around the globe. There are a number of strange and interesting New Year's traditions around the world. In Scotland, New Year's Eve is called Hogmanay and 'first footing' remains a popular custom with people visiting friends' and neighbours' houses just after midnight. The first person who visits your house should bring a gift as this will mean good luck. In Spain, it is the custom to eat 12 grapes as the bells sound for midnight on 31 December. One grape is eaten at each sound of the bell and each grape is supposed to bring good luck for each month of the year ahead. In Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia, Venezuela and some other Central and South American countries, people wear special underwear of different colours on New Year's Eve. Red is supposed to be good for bringing love in the new year, while yellow is supposed to bring money. The new year is a perfect time to make a change for the better. The tradition of making New Year's resolutions is more common in the western hemisphere but also exists in the eastern hemisphere. This tradition involves a person making a commitment to change an unwanted habit or behaviour or setting a personal objective. Typical New Year's resolutions might be to give up smoking, eat healthier food, do more exercise, become more organised or laugh more ‚Äì but really, a New Year's resolution can be almost anything. However, research suggests that many New Year's resolutions fail. Being realistic about the objectives you set and not making too many New Year's resolutions might help you to achieve success.

                "content": "The Penn State Nittany Lions team represents the Pennsylvania State University in college football. The Nittany Lions compete in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision as a member of the Big Ten Conference, which they joined in 1993 after playing as an Independent from 1892 to 1992.[3][4][5] Established in 1887, the Nittany Lions have achieved numerous on-field successes, including two consensus national championships in 1982 and 1986; four Big Ten Conference Championships in 1994, 2005, 2008, and 2016; 13 undefeated seasons in 1887, 1894, 1909, 1911, 1912, 1920, 1921, 1947, 1968, 1969, 1973, 1986 and 1994; and 53 appearances in college bowl games, with an all-time post-season bowl record of 32‚Äì20‚Äì2. The team ranks seventh among NCAA Division I college football programs in all-time total wins.[6] The Nittany Lions play their home games at Beaver Stadium, located on-campus in University Park, Pennsylvania. The first recorded game in Penn State football history occurred on November 12, 1881, when Penn State traveled to Lewisburg, Pennsylvania to play Bucknell, known until 1886 as the University at Lewisburg. Penn State won 9‚Äì0, which was nine goals to none. At the time, this was really a game of \"American rugby\". The father of American football, Walter Camp, did not develop the \"scrimmage\", the \"first down\" and the \"gridiron\" (yard markings) until 1882. Although this game was reported in two State College newspapers and the Mirror (University at Lewisburg campus newspaper), Bucknell denies that this game ever happened. Penn State did not field teams from 1882 through 1886. Penn State played its first season in 1887,[7] but had no head coach for their first five years, from 1887 to 1891.[7] The teams played its home games on the Old Main lawn on campus in State College, Pennsylvania. They compiled a 12‚Äì8‚Äì1 record in these seasons, playing as an independent from 1887 to 1890. In 1891, the Pennsylvania Intercollegiate Football Association (PIFA) was formed. It consisted of Bucknell (University at Lewisburg), Dickinson, Franklin & Marshall, Haverford, Penn State and Swarthmore. Lafayette and Lehigh were excluded because it was felt they would dominate the Association. Penn State won the championship with a 4‚Äì1‚Äì0 record. Bucknell's record was 3‚Äì1‚Äì1 (losing to Franklin & Marshall and tying Dickinson). The Association was dissolved prior to the 1892 season.[7] George W. Hoskins was the first head football coach at Penn State.[8] He posted a 17‚Äì4‚Äì4 record in his from 1892 to 1895 as head coach, and his .760 winning percentage ranks highest in program history.[8] His first team played its home game on the Old Main lawn on campus in State College, Pennsylvania, before the 500-seat Beaver Field opened in 1893.[8] He was succeeded by Samuel B. Newton,[citation needed] who posted a 12‚Äì14 (.462) record in three seasons, 1896‚Äì1898.[9] Sam Boyle coached for only one year in 1899 and compiled a 4‚Äì6‚Äì1 record (.409).[10] Pop Golden coached the Nittany Lions for three seasons from 1900 to 1902, tallying a record of 16‚Äì12‚Äì1 (.569).[11] Daniel A. Reed took over for the 1903 season and went 5‚Äì3 (.625).[12] Tom Fennell coached the Nittany Lions for five seasons from 1904 to 1908, posting a 33‚Äì17‚Äì1 (.657) record.[13] In 1907 the school adopted the Nittany Lion mascot, a mountain lion named after nearby Mount Nittany.[14][page needed] An early mascot was \"Old Coaly\", a mule that hauled stone for the original Old Main (completed in 1863 and demolished in 1929). Bill Hollenback took over the Nittany Lions as head coach for the 1909 season and went undefeated at 5‚Äì0‚Äì2,[15] but left for Missouri for 1910.[16] Bill's older brother Jack Hollenback took over for the 1910 season and went 5‚Äì2‚Äì1 (.688),[17] but Bill returned to Penn State from 1911 to 1914.[citation needed] Bill went 23‚Äì9‚Äì2 in his second tenure for a combined record of 28‚Äì9‚Äì4 (.732).[15] In 1911 and 1912, his teams went 8‚Äì0‚Äì1 and 8‚Äì0 and were awarded retroactive national championships by the National Championship Foundation which are recognized by the NCAA.[15] Head coach Dick Harlow brought a new form of defense, trying to go in-between or around offensive blockers rather than try to overpower them.[18][non-primary source needed] Harlow's Nittany Lions compiled a 20‚Äì8 (.714) record in his three seasons (1915‚Äì1917)[19] and was later inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach for his accomplishments.[18] Hugo Bezdek was Penn State's head football coach for 12 seasons[20] and was the Nittany Lions' first athletics director.[21] Bezdek posted a 65‚Äì30‚Äì11 record,[20] which included two undefeated seasons and a berth in the 1922 Rose Bowl, a game they lost.[20] Bezdek's Nittany Lions posted a losing record in only two of Bezdek's seasons, going 1‚Äì2‚Äì1 in 1918 and 3‚Äì5‚Äì1 in 1928.[20] Bezdek retired after the 1929 season and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1954.[21] Bob Higgins returned to his alma mater and served as Penn State's head football coach for 19 seasons.[22] He compiled a 91‚Äì57‚Äì11 overall record, which included 11 winning seasons and only five losing seasons.[22] Higgins' 1947 team tied SMU in the Cotton Bowl.[23] Higgins was forced to retire due to poor health following the 1948 season.[23] He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1954.[23] For one season, Joe Bedenk, also a Penn State alum, served as the Nittany Lions' head football coach.[24] He was promoted from offensive line coach after the retirement of his predecessor.[25] Bedenk posted a 5‚Äì4 record in his 1949,[24] his lone season as head coach, before requesting to return to his previous post as offensive line coach.[25] Rip Engle came to Penn State from Brown.[26][27] Engle posted a 104‚Äì48‚Äì4 record during his 16-season tenure as head coach and developed a game known as Angleball as a way for his players to maintain fitness in the off-season.[26][27] Engle never had a losing season at Penn State, and his 5‚Äì5 final season was his only non-winning season.[28] His 1959 and 1960 Nittany Lions teams won the Liberty Bowl, while his 1961 and 1962 teams reached the Gator Bowl, winning the first and losing the second.[28] Engle retired following the 1965 season and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1973.[26] Penn State assistant Joe Paterno was promoted to head coach following the retirement of Engle.[25] Paterno spent 46 seasons as the head football coach, the longest tenure of any head coach in the FBS, and 16 more seasons as an assistant, making his 62 total years coaching at Penn State the most of any coach at any school.[25] Under Paterno, Penn State played as an Independent from 1966 to 1992,[25] and he continued to coach them when they joined the Big Ten Conference in 1993‚Äì2011.[25] He also served as Penn State's athletic director from 1980 to 1982. His final record is 409‚Äì136‚Äì3.[29] His teams won national championships in 1982 and 1986,[29] posted non-losing records in all seasons but five,[29] and appeared in 37 bowl games with 24 wins.[29] His teams also won the Orange Bowl in 1968, 1969, 1973 and 2005;[29] the Fiesta Bowl in 1977, 1980, 1981, 1986, 1991 and 1996;[29] the Sugar Bowl in 1982; and the Rose Bowl in 1994.[29] In June 1990,[30] Penn State's athletics program, after a century as a Division I-A independent, joined the Big Ten Conference. Beaver Stadium was expanded six times during Paterno's tenure. He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2006 and was a major reason why the longtime rule of waiting until retirement to be inducted into the Hall of Fame was changed to any coach over 75 years of age.[25] Players including Kerry Collins, Charlie Zapiec, Matt Millen, Shane Conlan, Jack Ham, Dennis Onkotz, Franco Harris, Greg Buttle, Keith Dorney, John Cappelletti, Curt Warner, Larry Johnson, LaVar Arrington and Ted Kwalick played collegiately for him.[31] He won numerous coaching and sportsman honors during his long run at Penn State.[29] Paterno has the most wins in FBS football (409). Following the Pennsylvania Attorney General's release of a grand jury summary of child sexual abuse charges involving former assistant Jerry Sandusky,[32] the Penn State board of trustees fired Paterno in November 2011.[32][33] Defensive coordinator Tom Bradley finished out the 2011 season as interim head coach after Paterno's ouster.[34] In July 2012, the NCAA decided to vacate all of the team's wins from 1998 to 2011. Paterno's statue outside Beaver Stadium was also taken down.[35] The revised record dropped Paterno from first to twelfth on the all-time wins list,[36] but on January 16, 2015, the NCAA restored Paterno's vacated wins, and thus his record as the winningest FBS football coach.[37] To many he is \"The best Penn State head coach ever.\"[38] New England Patriots offensive coordinator Bill O'Brien was hired as the 15th head football coach at Penn State, taking over the Nittany Lions football program in January 2012.[39] Early in O'Brien's tenure, the NCAA sanctioned Penn State with a four-season postseason ban and a loss of 40 scholarships due to the child sex abuse scandal.[40] O'Brien posted an 8‚Äì4 record in his first season as head coach of the Nittany Lions.[41] O'Brien's 2013 Nittany Lions team posted a 7‚Äì5 record in the second of four years they were ineligible for the postseason.[42] In January 2014, Bill O'Brien left Penn State to accept the head coaching position with the NFL's Houston Texans.[43] On January 11, 2014, Vanderbilt head coach James Franklin was hired as the 16th Penn State head football coach.[44] He is the first African American head football coach at Penn State.[45] In Franklin's first year, the NCAA lifted Penn State's postseason ban and the Nittany Lions were bowl eligible. The Nittany Lions were named to the Pinstripe Bowl where they won against Boston College on December 27, 2014, at Yankee Stadium.[46] To start off the 2015 season, Penn State lost to Temple 27‚Äì10, its first loss to the Owls since 1941. The loss was followed by victories against Buffalo, Rutgers, San Diego State, Army and Indiana. The Nittany Lions then lost to Ohio State 38‚Äì10 in Columbus before winning, 31‚Äì30, at Maryland. The victory against Maryland brought the Nittany Lions to six wins, making them bowl eligible for the second year since the postseason ban was lifted. Penn State then shut out the Illinois 39‚Äì0 in the second to last home game of the 2015 season. They then lost to Michigan in Happy Valley 28‚Äì16 and to Michigan State 55‚Äì16 at MSU. The win‚Äìloss record for Penn State in the 2015 regular season was 7‚Äì5, and 7‚Äì6 after a loss to Georgia in the Taxslayer Bowl in Jacksonville. The 2016 season featured an upset over No. 2 Ohio State during a \"White-Out\" in State College. Following the win, Penn State was ranked 24th in the AP Poll, its first ranking since 2011.[47] Penn State finished the regular season 10‚Äì2, 8‚Äì1 in Big Ten play. After winning a tiebreaker against rivals Ohio State, Penn State went on to claim the Big Ten East title and a spot in the Big Ten Championship game in Indianapolis against Big Ten West champion Wisconsin, which they won after trailing 28‚Äì14 in the first half. They outscored the Badgers 24‚Äì3 in the second half to take home the Nittany Lions' fourth Big Ten Title.[48] On August 18, 2017, Penn State announced that Franklin signed a six-year contract extension worth $5.738 million a year.[49] That deal includes retention bonuses paid at the end of each year of the contract. \"My family and I are very thankful to be a part of the Penn State community,\" Franklin said in a statement. \"I am pleased with the progress our program has made in the community, in the classroom and on the field. I look forward to diligently working with President Barron and Director of Athletics Sandy Barbour on implementing a plan that puts our University and our student-athletes in the best position to compete on the field and in life.\"[50] In addition to the guaranteed money, Franklin's contract extension has incentives including $800,000 for a national title, $400,000 for a College Football Playoff appearance and $350,000 for winning the Big Ten Championship Game. His incentives are capped at $1 million per year.[51] Penn State went to 7‚Äì0 to begin the 2017 season, before losing on consecutive weekends to Ohio State and Michigan State. Penn State finished the regular season with wins over Rutgers Nebraska and Maryland. Penn State capped the 2017 season at the Fiesta Bowl, beating Washington, 35‚Äì28.[52] In 2018 the Lions went 9‚Äì4 with a loss to Kentucky in the Citrus Bowl. The 2019 season was spectacular for Penn State going 11‚Äì2 with the losses only to Minnesota by 26‚Äì31 and to Ohio State and beat American Athletic Conference Champion Memphis who at that time was 12‚Äì1. Penn State beat Memphis 53‚Äì39 in the Cotton Bowl. The 2020 season was James Franklin's first losing season with the Nittany Lions. They started off the season with COVID-19 pandemic spring cancelations. Penn State traveled to Bloomington to take on Indiana where they lost in overtime 35‚Äì36 with Michael Penix Jr.'s pendulum touch two-point conversion winning the Game for Indiana. The Nittany Lions took on Ohio State at home with no whiteout due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Penn State lost 25‚Äì38. The Nittany Lions took on Maryland who they had not lost to since 2014. The Terrapins beat Penn State 19‚Äì35 in Beaver Stadium. The Nittany Lions traveled to Nebraska to take on the Nebraska Cornhuskers where the Nittany Lions comeback fell short and lost 23‚Äì30. The Nittany Lions fought the Iowa Hawkeyes but lost 21‚Äì41 giving Penn State its first ever 0‚Äì5 start in its history. The Nittany Lions, determined to win, traveled to Ann Arbor to defeat the Michigan Wolverines. Penn State got its first victory of the season 27‚Äì17 going 1‚Äì5. Penn State took on the Rutgers Scarlet Knights in Piscataway where they won again 23‚Äì7 thus giving them a 2‚Äì5 record. Penn State went home to take on the Michigan State. They trailed 10‚Äì21 at halftime but rallied back to win 39‚Äì24 getting a 3‚Äì5 record. For the Big Ten Championship week Penn State hosted the Fighting Illini at home. Penn State won in rout 56‚Äì21 going to a 4‚Äì5 record. Penn State players voted to not accept a bowl invitation so their final record was 4‚Äì5. A major offseason change was replacing first-year offensive coordinator Kirk Ciarrocca with Texas offensive coordinator Mike Yurcich. James Franklin is currently under a ten-year $75,000,000 contract (as of 2021). In 2021, Penn State improved upon its lackluster 2020 season going 7‚Äì6. The Nittany Lions finished the season unranked and with a 4‚Äì5 Big Ten Conference record. They went 2‚Äì3 on the road while maintaining a winning 5‚Äì2 record at Beaver Stadium. The season started strong on September 4, 2021, when Penn State defeated the #12 ranked Wisconsin Badgers football team. They won their next 4 games including a 28‚Äì20 win over the #22 Auburn Tigers football team. Then they began to struggle after a close 23‚Äì20 loss to the #3 Iowa Hawkeyes on the road October 9, 2021. On October 23, 2021, Penn State battled the Illinois Fighting Illini through an NCAA record 9 overtimes, eventually losing 20‚Äì18. The teams both scored fieldgoals in the first 2 overtimes, tying the score 16‚Äì16. Neither team scored until the 8th overtime when Illinois finally broke the stalemate, quickly followed by a run from Penn State's Noah Cain. Penn State did not score during its first conversion attempt in overtime 9, leaving the door open for Illinois to eventually score and win the game.[53] The Nittany Lions' only subsequent wins came against Maryland (31‚Äì14) and Rutgers (28‚Äì0). They closed out the 2021 season playing Arkansas at the Outback Bowl, losing the game 24‚Äì10.[54] Penn State has a strong 2022 campaign losing to only Michigan and Ohio State and defeating Pac 12 champion Utah in the 2023 Rose Bowl. Penn State has also been named national champions on seven occasions by NCAA-designated major selectors.[55][56]: 111‚Äì115 Penn State claims the 1982 and 1986 championships under Joe Paterno's tenure,[57] both of which are consensus national championships.[56]: 120 Historically, Penn State played as an independent from 1887 through 1890, then in 1891 as a member of the Pennsylvania Intercollegiate Football Association Penn State won the PIFA championship with a 4‚Äì1‚Äì0 PIFA record, losing only to Bucknell (Bucknell's record was 3‚Äì1‚Äì1). The PIFA dissolved prior to the 1892 season. Penn State then played as an independent again until joining the Big Ten Conference in 1990 and beginning play in 1993. Penn State then won its first Big Ten championship in 1994, they won two more in 2005 and 2008, and they won a fourth under James Franklin in 2016. ‚Ä† Co-champions ‚Ä† Co-champions Before the 2006 season, Beaver Stadium was updated and seasons of note were honored by being listed in front of the suite fa√ßade.[58] The following seasons are highlighted; Penn State has earned invitations to 53 bowl games. The Nittany Lions have compiled a bowl record of 31‚Äì20‚Äì2 (.604), including a 17‚Äì7‚Äì1 (.700) record in the major bowls (Rose, Orange, Sugar, Fiesta, and Cotton).[59] Coach Joe Paterno was responsible for most of these bids and victories, compiling more appearances (37) than any other coach in college football en route to his bowl record of 24‚Äì12‚Äì1 (.662). Paterno also has a record of 14‚Äì5 (.737) in \"major\" bowls and is the only coach to have won all five major college bowls during his career. James Franklin is the head coach of Penn State since the 2014 season.[60] Penn State and Maryland met in briefly interrupted stretches between 1917 and 1993, with a near-consecutive run played all but three years (1976, 1981, and 1983) between 1960 and 1993. However, the one-sided record belies what was often a competitive matchup until its final years. While Maryland only compiled one win and one tie, numerous games were narrowly lost by missed field goals and turnovers. In 1975, a field goal attempt by kicker Mike Sochko hit the upright with under a minute left, and Maryland lost 15‚Äì13. Ten years later, the Terps missed three field goals to eventually lose 20‚Äì18. After the Nittany Lions' move to the Big Ten Conference in 1993, the series was canceled. However, Maryland ended up joining the Big Ten as well, in 2014, reinstating the rivalry after more than 2 decades of being dormant. Maryland would win the first matchup by a point (20‚Äì19) after infamously declining to shake hands with Penn State captains at midfield during the coin toss at Beaver Stadium. The second meeting as conference foes would be played in Baltimore at M&T Bank Stadium and would again be decided by a point, this time a Penn State win 31‚Äì30. The last four matchups (2016‚Äì2019), all victories for Penn State have seen the Nittany Lions outscore the Terrapins by a combined score of 201‚Äì20 (38‚Äì14, 66‚Äì3, 38‚Äì3, 59‚Äì0). The latest match up was played on November 30, 2024, at Beaver Stadium, with Penn State winning 44‚Äì7. Penn State leads the series 44‚Äì3‚Äì1 through the 2024 season.[61] Prior to 1993, Penn State had never played against Michigan, but since then many of the games have been competitive duels with shots at a Big Ten title at stake, and subsequently a national championship. Michigan leads the series, 17‚Äì10.[62] Since 1993, Penn State has played Michigan State for the Land Grant Trophy. Penn State holds possession of the trophy after winning the 2023 contest. Penn State leads the series, 19‚Äì18‚Äì1 as of 2024.[63] When Penn State joined the Big Ten in 1993, Minnesota was the first conference opponent they played. To commemorate this, the governors of both states commissioned a trophy called the Governor's Victory Bell to landmark this event. Since then, the trophy has traveled hands between the winners of each contest. Penn State leads the series, 11‚Äì6.[64] The rivalry began before Penn State was a member of the Big Ten. Penn State won the first four meetings of the series, which were held between 1912 and 1964. Then Ohio State won in 1975 in a game held in Columbus, Ohio and again in 1976 during the first ever matchup between the two teams in State College, Pennsylvania. Penn State and Ohio State would meet again in 1980 in their first and only postseason bowl, the 1980 Fiesta Bowl, which Penn State won. After the Fiesta Bowl, the two teams would not meet again until Penn State joined the Big Ten in 1993. Since then, the Nittany Lions and Buckeyes have played each other annually. Ohio State leads the series 25‚Äì14 through the 2024 season.[65] This is a long-standing series between in-state rivals Penn State and Pittsburgh. The rivalry, once one of the fiercest and most important in college football north of the Mason‚ÄìDixon line, began on November 6, 1893, at the inaugural game of Beaver Field in State College, and Penn State won the contest 32‚Äì0.[66] The first two decades of the series was dominated by Penn State taking 12 of 15 matchups between 1893 and 1912. From 1913 to 1949 Pitt would hold a 26‚Äì6‚Äì2 advantage, before Rip Engle took over as head coach for Penn State in 1950. With Joe Paterno as an assistant coach, Engle led Penn State to a 9‚Äì6‚Äì1 record against the Panthers from 1950 to 1965. When Paterno was named head coach in 1965, the next 31 games would swing heavily in the Nittany Lion's favor, holding a 23‚Äì7‚Äì1 advantage from 1966 to 2000.[67] The rivalry went on a 15-year hiatus prior to the scheduling of a 4-game series in 2011[68] that would see Penn State travel to Pittsburgh in 2016 & 2018 with Pitt returning to Happy Valley in 2017 & 2019. The series was branded the Keystone Classic in 2016,[69] which saw Pitt hold on for a thrilling 42‚Äì39[70] victory fending off a fierce fourth quarter comeback that fell short on an interception late in the 4th quarter.[71] The Nittany Lions would take the final three games, winning 33‚Äì13 in 2017, 51‚Äì6 in 2018, and most recently 17‚Äì10[72] in Beaver Stadium in 2019.[73] There are no future games scheduled between the two schools, although there is talk of a potential neutral site matchup sometime in the future.[74] The Nittany Lions and Panthers have met on the football field 100 times. Penn State holds a 10-win advantage in the series, 53‚Äì43‚Äì4, through the 2024 season.[75] The rivalry started in 1922, when Syracuse fought Penn State to a scoreless tie. But it was during the 1950s and 1960s that the rivalry intensified, as it enjoyed a competitive and often controversial string of contests. Syracuse football was led by Ben Schwartzwalder, and Penn State by Rip Engle, then Joe Paterno. From 1950 to 1970, Syracuse won 11 games to Penn State's 10. After Schwartzwalder retired in 1973, Syracuse floundered. Penn State won 16 straight from 1971 to 1986. Conference realignment and scheduling disagreements also dampened the intensity of the rivalry. Penn State fans and players increasingly turned their attention to the rivalry with Pittsburgh. In 1987, Coach Dick MacPherson finally led Syracuse to a resounding 48‚Äì21 victory over the Nittany Lions in the Carrier Dome. Syracuse won again the following year in Happy Valley but lost the last two games before the series was suspended in 1991. The rivalry has since been renewed three times since the series suspension ‚Äî in 2008, 2009, and 2013. The Nittany Lions won all three of these contests. Penn State leads the series 43‚Äì23‚Äì5 with the most recent game played in 2013. Next meeting between the two teams is scheduled for September 4, 2027.[76] Penn State and West Virginia have played each other 59 times. The first game was in 1904 when Penn State won that game 34‚Äì0. In their most recent encounter on August 31, 2024, Penn State won 34‚Äì12 in Morgantown. This series has been dominated by the Nittany Lions who lead the series 50‚Äì9‚Äì2.[77] Though the Crimson Tide are not as much of a traditional opponent for the Nittany Lions, the two teams are still often considered among the best in the country, claim a combined 20 national titles (of which 18 belong to Alabama), and have met in a bowl game three times. The series began on December 19, 1959, in that year's edition of the Liberty Bowl, a 7‚Äì0 win for No. 12 Penn State. Sixteen years later, the Nittany Lions and Crimson Tide met in the 1975 Sugar Bowl, resulting in a 13‚Äì6 Tide victory in New Orleans. Perhaps the most notable game between these two teams came four years later, in a 1979 Sugar Bowl rematch, resulting in another Alabama victory. The rivalry was intensified during the 1980s, when the Lions and Tide met in 10 consecutive seasons, all during regular season play. After this time, the rivalry went dormant for two decades before being renewed for a 2-game home-and-home series in 2010 and 2011. Alabama leads the series 10‚Äì5 with the last game played in 2011.[78] This White Out tradition dates back to a student section white out in 2004 (against Purdue) and has become one of the most eagerly anticipated games during the football season. In recent years, Penn State students have donned white clothes, paint - anything white - to show their solidarity and support for the Nittany Lions. Forming a mass of bouncing and infectious enthusiasm, the students have \"Whited Out\" Beaver Stadium, the Bryce Jordan Center and other sports venues, making them some of the noisiest and most intimidating stadiums in America.[79] Beano Cook of ESPN says, \"If you aren't impressed with the White Out, you're probably one of those people who think the moon landing was faked.\"[80] Originally named \"Paternoville\", Nittanyville is a student camp out that occurs every week of a Penn State home football game. The students camp out to support the team and to acquire the best possible seats for the weekend's upcoming game, since seating is first-come, first serve for students. While the name \"Paternoville\" came about during Penn State's 2005 football season, students have long camped out for first row seats. Prior to 1993, the university distributed non-seat-specific tickets. Starting the same year Penn State football began competition in the Big Ten Conference, students were assigned seats on a first-come-first-serve basis, so that the first students to pass through \"Gate A\" at the south-east corner of the stadium would be assigned first row seats, and so on down the line.[81] Since then, students have camped out in small to massive numbers in order to guarantee themselves a front row seat to a Penn State home football game. The 2005 season saw the naming of the tent-city. In anticipation of the 2005 contest between No. 16 Penn State and No. 6 Ohio State, students began camping six days in advance of the game outside the gate so that they would get a first row seat for, arguably, the biggest game of the 2005 season for Penn State. On Tuesday of the week preceding the game, \"Paternoville\" first appeared. Credited with the naming, freshman Dan Clark and the other students camping with him created a banner reading \"Paternoville\".[82] The name stuck, and on Wednesday morning, October 5, 2005, newspapers were already referring to the campsite as \"Paternoville\". State-wide, regional, and even national media outlets began paying attention to the show in front of Gate A. Local businesses printed t-shirts up for the students, brought truckloads of food, and distributed various things like magazines and small footballs to keep the students occupied. Throughout the week, players, coaches, and many alumni and media personalities paid visits to Paternoville.[83] On Friday, ESPN's \"Cold Pizza\" morning show was broadcast from in front of the Bryce Jordan Center, across from the stadium, with some of the cast walking through Paternoville interviewing students and taping their activities, despite the constant drizzle. The next day, ESPN's College Gameday also was broadcast in front of the Bryce Jordan Center, hours before the showdown between the cross-border rivals.[84] Before noon, the tents were packed away and hundreds of students began to line up for entry into the stadium. That night, in a historic game, the Nittany Lions upset the No. 6 ranked Buckeyes 17‚Äì10 in front of a crowd of almost 110,000. The game being decided on a fumble by Ohio State quarterback and future Heisman Trophy winner Troy Smith, caused by Penn State defensive end Tamba Hali and recovered by defensive tackle Scott Paxson. After the final whistle, the students rushed the field.[85] The Paternoville name continued after the game. Since the original \"Paternoville\", two other games have garnered comparable camp-outs. They were the 2005 game against the University of Wisconsin Badgers, which was Senior Day for the 2005 season,[86] and the 2006 contest against University of Michigan Wolverines. However, students camp out for every game, not solely the \"big\" games. On average, about 10‚Äì15 tents appear for every game, while the number of tents for the 2005 Ohio State and Wisconsin games and the 2006 Michigan game exceeded 100.[87] Prior to the 2006 season, the university placed several markers around Beaver Stadium commemorating various traditions related to Penn State football. To the left of Gate A there is a marker for the Penn State \"student section\" and to the right of the gate there is a marker for \"Paternoville\".[88] Since 2006, the practice of camping out has grown every year until 2009, when over 2,000 different students camped out for one or multiple games throughout the season. In 2011, the record was broken because of Penn State's high-powered home schedule, which included SEC powerhouse Alabama and new in-conference foe Nebraska, amongst other teams.[89] In the summer of 2012, \"Paternoville\" officially became \"Nittanyville\". As Coach Paterno was no longer the coach of Penn State's football team, the organization decided that since it was unlikely another coach would stay as long as Coach Paterno had, changing the name for each new coach would be impractical. However, aside from the name, nothing was changed and students continued to support the team and camp out for the primary seats.[90] Joe Paterno was widely known for his \"grand experiment\" in which he challenged his players to be successful both on the field and in the classroom.[91] In 2011, the Nittany Lion football team posted an 87% graduation rate, tied with Stanford for No. 10 overall among the nation's 120 Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) institutions, above the national average of 67%.[92] The June 2012 conviction of former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky on multiple counts of child sexual abuse marred the \"Success with Honor\" image.[93] President Rodney Erickson, athletics director Dave Joyner, and head football coach Bill O'Brien, all of whom accepted their jobs in the wake of the scandal, have made statements in which they express commitment to maintaining integrity at the university and within the athletics programs.[94] In 2012, a group of alumni and supporters established a non-profit organization [501(c)(3) and registered trademark] that will build upon the \"Success with Honor\" motto. Their mission is to promote and support charitable endeavors as well as to inspire others to \"Get in the Game.\" Success with Honor is a Social Network Community that has identified more than 60+ charities. Success with Honor helps individuals to identify and connect with causes they would like to volunteer their skills, time, and/or money to. Similarly, SWH assists charities in finding individuals to meet their current needs.[95] The team is widely noted for their simple game uniforms. They only wear white pants, and the jerseys are simple blue for home games, and white for away games.[96] The team is only allowed to wear simple black Nike shoes with white calf socks for game days, though blue tights are permitted underneath the white socks for cold weather games. The helmet is white with a blue stripe down the center, and a blue on white \"Penn State\" sticker covers up the forehead helmet logo. No team logos, conference logos, numbers, or other stickers are permitted on the helmet, though two Nike logos are on facemask visors that some players choose to wear. Penn State has started to wear bowl decals only starting with 1997 Fiesta Bowl. Before that, Penn State always declined the decals so they can play out of their simple game uniforms. The blue and white uniforms replaced the school's original colors, pink and black, in 1890 after a student referendum. A common legend of the color change is that the original colors faded in the sun. Black became a hue of navy blue and the pink became such a light hue that it appeared white. The historicity of this, however, is very questionable, as evidence of it being the root cause is scarce.[97] The uniforms became even simpler for the 2011 season, as the white cuffs and collars on the home jerseys and the corresponding blue cuffs and collars on the road jerseys were eliminated, leaving the jerseys solid blue and white, respectively. In 2012 Penn State started wearing names on their uniforms for the first time as a way to note the players who stuck with the school through the scandal and a blue ribbon in support the victims of child abuse.[98] In 2013, the Nittany Lion logo was added to the base of the jersey collar along with the Big Ten logo on the right side of the jersey. Starting in 2015, the names that were added throughout the 2012‚Äì14 seasons to honor those who stayed with the program were removed and the team reverted to the traditional nameless jerseys while still retaining the Nittany Lion logo at the base of the jersey collar. The team also began sporting new Nike Elite 51 jerseys which feature a new design on the collars.[99] In addition, the team added the words \"Nittany Lions\" onto the back of the football helmets. For the 2017 homecoming game against the Indiana Hoosiers, Penn State broke tradition by donning throwback jerseys in what was dubbed the \"Generations of Greatness\" game. These uniforms integrated elements from past uniforms, including: numbers on helmets' sides, block uniform numbers, white stripes on sleeves, blue stripes on pants, striped socks, gray facemasks, white cleats, and a few other subtle changes.[100] Captains are chosen by the team, with the head coach's approval. Being named a captain is an honor almost always given to a senior, but there are some notable exceptions: Linebacker Sean Lee was named a captain in the beginning of Spring practice in 2008, the beginning of his 4th year with the team. However, he suffered a torn ACL during spring practice, redshirted in 2008, and returned as a captain again in 2009. The most recent example of a \"true\" junior being named was Paul Posluszny, who was named a captain in both 2005 and 2006, his junior and senior years, respectively. The last time a junior was named captain before Posluszny was in 1968, when Steve Smear and Mike Reid were named captains during their junior years.[101] In 2014, Christian Hackenberg became the first true sophomore to be named team captain.[102] Penn State is referred to as Linebacker U for its reputation of producing outstanding linebackers.[103][better source needed] The scandal centered on then retired Penn State football assistant coach Jerry Sandusky's sexual assault of two underage boys on or near university property. After a grand jury investigation, Sandusky was indicted on 52 counts of child molestation dating from 1994.[110] The trial started on June 11, 2012, at the Centre County Courthouse in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania,[111][112] and ended on June 22, when the jury found Sandusky guilty on 45 counts.[113][114] On October 9, 2012, Sandusky was sentenced to 30‚Äì60 years in prison.[115] Several high-level school officials were charged with perjury,[116] suspended, or dismissed for allegedly covering up the incidents or failing to notify authorities. School president Graham Spanier was forced to resign, and head football coach Joe Paterno was fired without cause late in the season, while Sandusky maintained his innocence.[117] Former FBI director Louis Freeh, whose firm was hired by the Penn State Board of Trustees to conduct an investigation, concluded, after ostensibly conducting 400 interviews and reviewing 3.5 million documents, that Paterno, Spanier, Curley and Schultz had \"repeatedly concealed critical facts relating to Sandusky's abuse from the authorities, the Board of Trustees, Penn State community, and the public at large.\"[118][119][120] In an interview on 60 Minutes Sports, the former Chief Deputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania, Frank Fina, who investigated and prosecuted Sandusky, stated he found no evidence that Paterno participated in a cover-up.[121] In July 2012, NCAA announced it had fined the Penn State football program $60 million, levied a 4-year ban from bowl games and vacated all the program's 112 wins from 1998 to 2011. The program was originally scheduled to lose 10 scholarships from incoming classes in 2013‚Äì16, which would have been a loss of 40 scholarships.[122] In September 2013, the NCAA announced they were restoring 25 of the 40 scholarships to Penn State \"[d]ue to Penn State University's continued progress toward ensuring athletics integrity\". After losing 10 scholarships from the 2013‚Äì2014 incoming class and only having 75 total players on scholarship, Penn State gained five scholarships back for 2014‚Äì15, bringing in 20 new players with 80 total on scholarship. Full scholarships were regained for 2016‚Äì17. In total they lost only 15 scholarships.[123] The decision to return the scholarships was by the executive committee of the NCAA following a recommendation from former US Sen. George Mitchell. The NCAA had appointed Mitchell to monitor progress of Penn State's reforms to enhance their \"security, ethics, governance and compliance structure\". The decision was based upon the belief the restored scholarships would provide benefits to student-athletes.[124] Lawsuits were filed against NCAA related to the levy of penalties. In 2014 the NCAA, under the auspices of favorable reports from Mitchell, announced that Penn State would be eligible for the 2014 postseason and all scholarships restored in 2015.[125] The team's wins and records that had been vacated were restored, pending full approval, as part of a legal settlement in 2015.[126][127] Penn State is one of 11 schools with five or more inductees in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[144] Including former head coach Joe Paterno, 26 Nittany Lion players and coaches have been selected for the College Football Hall of Fame.[145] [146][147]",

                "content": "The Alabama Crimson Tide football program represents the University of Alabama (variously Alabama, UA, or Bama) in the sport of American football. The team competes in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Southeastern Conference (SEC).[6] The team is currently led by Kalen DeBoer. The Crimson Tide is among the most storied and decorated football programs in NCAA history. Since beginning play in 1892, the program claims 18 national championships,[7][8][9] including 13 wire-service (AP or Coaches') national titles in the poll-era, and five other titles before the poll-era.[9][10][11] From 1958 to 1982, the team was led by Hall of Fame coach Paul \"Bear\" Bryant, who won six national titles with the program.[8] Alabama then had a dominant run under head coach Nick Saban between 2007 and 2023, resulting in six further national titles. The team's rallying cry is \"Roll Tide!\". It was not until 2009 that an Alabama player received a Heisman Trophy, when running back Mark Ingram II became the university's first winner. In 2015, Derrick Henry became the university's second Heisman winner.[12] The Crimson Tide won back to back Heisman trophies in 2020 and 2021, with DeVonta Smith and Bryce Young. Alabama has 974 official victories[a][b] in NCAA Division I (an additional 21 victories were vacated, and eight victories and one tie were forfeited). Alabama has won 34 conference championships (4 Southern Conference and 30 SEC championships), and has made an NCAA-record 78 postseason bowl appearances. The program has 36 seasons with ten wins or more (plus one vacated)[13][14] and has 46[b] bowl victories, both NCAA records.[15] The Crimson Tide lead the SEC West Division with 18 division titles and 15 appearances in the SEC Championship Game. The Associated Press (AP) ranks Alabama fourth in all-time final AP Poll appearances, with 61 through the 2023 season.[16][17] Alabama plays its home games at Bryant‚ÄìDenny Stadium, located on the campus in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. With a capacity of 100,077,[1] Bryant‚ÄìDenny is the 10th largest non-racing stadium in the world and the eighth largest stadium in the United States. Alabama has had 28 head coaches since organized football began in 1892. Adopting the nickname \"Crimson Tide\" after the 1907 season, 12 coaches have led the Crimson Tide in postseason bowl games: Wallace Wade, Frank Thomas, Harold D. \"Red\" Drew, Bear Bryant, Ray Perkins, Bill Curry, Gene Stallings, Mike DuBose, Dennis Franchione, Mike Shula, Joe Kines, and Nick Saban.[7] Eight of those coaches also won conference championships: Wade, Thomas, Drew, Bryant, Curry, Stallings, DuBose, and Saban. During their tenures, Wade, Thomas, Bryant, Stallings, and Saban all won national championships with the Crimson Tide.[7] Of the 27 different head coaches who have led the Crimson Tide, Wade,[18] Thomas,[19] Bryant,[20] and Stallings have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. The current head coach is Kalen DeBoer, who took over the position in 2024 following the retirement of long-time head coach Nick Saban following the 2023 season.[21][22][23] National championships in NCAA FBS college football are debated as the NCAA does not officially award the championship. Despite not naming an official National Champion, the NCAA provides lists of championships awarded by \"major selectors.\"[9][24] According to the official NCAA 2009 Division I Football Records Book, \"During the last 138 years, there have been more than 30 selectors of national champions using polls, historical research and mathematical rating systems. Beginning in 1936, the Associated Press began the best-known and most widely circulated poll of sportswriters and broadcasters. Before 1936, national champions were determined by historical research and retroactive ratings and polls. [...] The criteria for being included in this historical list of poll selectors is that the poll be national in scope, either through distribution in newspaper, television, radio and/or computer online.\"[25] Since World War II, Alabama claims only national championships awarded by the final AP Poll or the final Coaches' Poll.[citation needed] This policy is consistent with other FBS football programs with numerous national title claims,[citation needed] including Notre Dame, USC, and Oklahoma, except that in the pre-1936 era, unlike Alabama, there are major selectors' titles that these schools do not claim. All national championships claimed by the University of Alabama were published in nationally syndicated newspapers and magazines, and each of the national championship selectors, and are cited in the Official 2010 NCAA FBS Record Book.[26] In addition to the championships claimed by the university, the NCAA has listed Alabama as receiving a championship for the 1945, 1966, 1975, and 1977 college football seasons.[9][24] In Alabama's 1982 media guide, the last for Coach Bryant, 1934 is listed as the only national championship before Coach Bryant in a footnote about the school's SEC history. In the 1980s, Alabama's Sports Information Director Wayne Atcheson started recognizing five pre-Bryant national championship teams (1925, 1926, 1930, 1934, 1941) by adding them to the university's Football Media Guide. According to Atcheson, he made the effort in the context of disputed titles being claimed by other schools, and \"to make Alabama football look the best it could look\" to compete with the other claimants. Atcheson maintains that the titles are the school's rightful claims.[27] Four of the five championships claimed in the Media Guide come before the AP poll was introduced in 1936. Many schools claim national championships from pre-1936 because there was no contemporary or nationally recognized authoritative source before that year. The University of Alabama 2009 Official Football Media Guide says Alabama had 12 national championships prior to winning the 2010 BCS National Championship Game.[28] The 2009, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2017, and 2020 titles bring the total number of national championships claimed by Alabama to 18. Thirteen of Alabama's national championships were awarded by the wire-services (AP, Coaches' Poll) or by winning the BCS National Championship Game.[9][24] In January 2013, CNN suggested that Alabama might be college football's new dynasty,[29] and in May 2013, Athlon Sports ranked Alabama's ongoing dynasty as the fourth-best since 1934, behind Oklahoma (1948‚Äì58), Miami (1986‚Äì92), and Nebraska (1993‚Äì97).[30] Alabama has won a total of 34 conference championships; this includes four Southern Conference and 30 SEC Championships. Alabama captured its four Southern Conference titles in 1924, 1925, 1926, and 1930. Alabama captured the first SEC title in 1933 and has won a total of 30 SEC Championships (1933, 1934, 1937, 1945, 1953, 1961, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1981, 1989‚Ä†, 1992, 1999, 2009, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2018, 2020, 2021, 2023). The school has won more SEC football titles than any other school, including 11 since the conference split into separate divisions and added the Championship Game in 1992. Alabama is the only school to win an SEC Championship in every decade since the conference was founded in 1933. ‚Ä† Co-champions The SEC was split into two divisions beginning in the 1992 season. Alabama competed in the SEC West. Alabama won 18 division titles and posted an 11‚Äì4 record in the SEC Championship Game. ‚Ä† Co-champions Every year, several publications release lists of their ideal \"team\". The athletes on these lists are referred to as All-Americans. The NCAA recognizes five All-American lists. They are the Associated Press (AP), American Football Coaches Association (AFCA), Football Writers Association of America (FWAA), Sporting News (TSN), and the Walter Camp Football Foundation (WCFF). Alabama has had 149 players honored 173 times as first team All-Americans (84 consensus)[54][55] in its history, including 20 players honored twice and two players (Cornelius Bennett and Woodrow Lowe) who were honored three times as a First Team All-American.[56] The most recent All-Americans from Alabama came after the 2022 season, when Will Anderson Jr. and Brian Branch were each named First Team All-America by various selectors. In 1951, the College Football Hall of Fame opened in South Bend, Indiana. Since then, Alabama has had 23 players and four former coaches inducted into the Hall of Fame.[57][58] Alabama had two members inducted into the inaugural 1951 class‚ÄîDon Hutson[59] and Frank Thomas.[60] On December 12, 2009, Mark Ingram II became Alabama's first Heisman Trophy winner.[12] In the closest race ever, he edged out Stanford running back Toby Gerhart by 28 points.[12] Other notable finishes for an Alabama player occurred in 1993, when David Palmer finished third in the Heisman voting[61][62] and when A. J. McCarron finished as runner-up for the 2013 season.[63] Derrick Henry became Alabama's second Heisman trophy winner on December 12, 2015.[64] Tua Tagovailoa finished runner-up for the 2018 season as well. For the 2020 season, Alabama became the second program in college football history to have three players finish in the top five. DeVonta Smith became Alabama's third Heisman winner with Mac Jones finishing third and Najee Harris fifth. In 2021, Bryce Young became the fourth winner with Will Anderson Jr. finishing fifth. With its fourth Heisman winner Alabama has produced the fifth most Heisman trophies of all time behind Notre Dame, Oklahoma, Ohio State and USC.[65] Top 5 finishes for Alabama players: Starting in 1994, the Southeastern Conference has annually honored one former football player from each of the SEC member schools as an \"SEC Legend\". The following former Crimson Tide football players have been honored as SEC Legends. The main rivalry of the Crimson Tide is against its in-state rival, Auburn University; considered one of the top sporting rivalries in the US. The Alabama-Auburn game has come to be known as the Iron Bowl.[66][67] The outcome of the game generally determines \"bragging rights\" in the state of Alabama until the following contest. The game may also have implications as to which team will represent the SEC Western Division in the SEC Championship Game. On February 22, 1893, at Lakeview Park in Birmingham, Auburn was victorious in the first ever Iron Bowl, 32‚Äì22. The series was suspended after the 1907 contest, due to violence and financial complications.[68] In 1944, Auburn suggested to reopen the series, though the board of trustees at Alabama rejected. The series was resumed in 1948, with Alabama crushing the Tigers 55‚Äì0, which is still the largest margin of victory in the series.[69][70] In the following contest, Auburn shocked Alabama with a 14‚Äì13 victory, which is credited with helping revive the series.[71] For many years, the contest was held at Legion Field in Birmingham, before the teams began alternating between Bryant-Denny Stadium, in Tuscaloosa, and Jordan‚ÄìHare Stadium, in Auburn. Alabama won the most recent meeting 28-14 in Tuscaloosa and leads the series at 51-37‚Äì1.[72] Despite the heated in-state rivalry with Auburn, Bear Bryant was more adamant about defeating his rivals to the north, the Tennessee Volunteers.[73] The series is named the Third Saturday in October, the traditional calendar date on which the game was played. Despite the name, the game has been played on the third Saturday only five times between 1995 and 2007. The first game between the two sides was played in 1901 in Birmingham, ending in a 6‚Äì6 tie. From 1902 to 1913, Alabama dominated the series, losing only once, and never allowing a touchdown by the Volunteers. Beginning in 1928, the rivalry was first played on its traditional date and began to be a challenge for the Crimson Tide as Robert Neyland began challenging Alabama for their perennial spot on top of the conference standings.[74] In the 1950s, Jim Goostree, the head trainer for Alabama, began another tradition as he began handing out cigars following a victory over the Volunteers.[75] Between 1971 and 1981, Alabama held an 11-game winning streak over the Volunteers and, between 1986 and 1994, a nine-game unbeaten streak. However, following Alabama's streak, Tennessee responded with a seven-game winning streak from 1995 to 2001. Alabama holds the longest winning streak at 15 from 2007 to 2021. Tennessee won the most recent meeting 24-17 in Knoxville, while Alabama leads the series 59‚Äì40‚Äì7. [76] A rivalry within the SEC Western Division occurs yearly between Alabama and the LSU Tigers. Starting in 1895, the Tigers were victorious 12‚Äì6 in the first meeting.[77] The teams did not regularly meet until the mid-1960s during Alabama's dominance of the SEC. Between 1971 and 1981, the Crimson Tide won 11 consecutive times. In the 1969 game, LSU defeated Alabama 20‚Äì15 in Baton Rouge. Alabama did not lose again in Baton Rouge until 2000. In 2007, the meeting was more heated following Alabama's hiring of head coach Nick Saban, who previously coached at LSU. With the hiring, many media outlets dubbed the 2007 meeting as the \"Saban Bowl\".[78][79][80] The Crimson Tide lost the first \"Saban Bowl\" in 2007, won the 2008 and 2009 meetings only to lose in Baton Rouge in 2010. In 2011, the teams played as the consensus No. 1 and No. 2 ranked teams in the polls with LSU winning 9‚Äì6 in overtime. They played each other again for the BCS National Championship with Alabama winning 21‚Äì0 to secure its 14th National Championship. Alabama won the most recent meeting 42‚Äì13 in Baton Rouge, and leads the series 57-27‚Äì5.[81] Alabama also maintains a rivalry with the Ole Miss Rebels. Alabama won the most recent meeting 24‚Äì10 in Tuscaloosa, and leads the series 55‚Äì10‚Äì2.[82] Alabama's most-played rival is Mississippi State. The rivalry has been called the \"Battle for Highway 82\", with the schools being only 90 miles apart. Many cite the 2014 meeting as the biggest game in the series where Alabama faced a #1 ranked, 9‚Äì0 Mississippi State team with Dak Prescott as its quarterback. Alabama won 25‚Äì20, which helped catapult them into the first College Football Playoff. Alabama won the most recent meeting 40‚Äì17 in Starkville and leads the series 86‚Äì18‚Äì3.[83] The series dates back to 1900 but the rivalry has intensified in recent years, with the last four meetings having national championship implications.[84] Alabama leads the series 14‚Äì5.[85] Alabama has a rivalry with the Florida Gators, which was largely developed with the start of the SEC Championship Game.[86] Alabama and Florida have met in 10 SEC Title Games (Alabama leads 6‚Äì4 in Title games), including the first 3 from 1992 to 1994. Alabama won the most recent meeting 31‚Äì29 in Gainesville, and leads the entire series 27‚Äì14.[87] Alabama has a rivalry with the Georgia Bulldogs. Alabama won the most recent meeting 41‚Äì34 in Tuscaloosa and leads the series 44‚Äì26‚Äì4.[88] The Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets were at one time considered Alabama's arch rival.[citation needed] During the suspension of the Iron Bowl between 1907 and 1948, Georgia Tech (then a member of the SEC) emerged as the most intense game on Alabama's schedule. The teams played many significant games, especially in the late 1950s and early 1960s. A heated feud developed between Bear Bryant and Georgia Tech head coach Bobby Dodd following a controversial hit in the 1961 game, a 10‚Äì0 Alabama victory.[89] Dodd cited this feud as the primary impetus for Georgia Tech leaving the SEC three years later.[90] The two teams have met 52 times, making Georgia Tech Alabama's most played among current non-conference opponents. Alabama leads the series 28‚Äì21‚Äì3; Georgia Tech won the last meeting in 1984. Alabama's fight song, \"Yea Alabama\", mentions Georgia Tech with the line \"Send the Yellow Jackets to a watery grave.\"[91] There have been many historic games between Alabama and Penn State. The two teams met five times during the tenure of Bear Bryant, including in the 1979 Sugar Bowl, which determined the national championship for the 1978 season. The games usually have national implications‚Äîseven of the 15 meetings between the two schools have featured both teams ranked in the top ten‚Äîand eight of the meetings have been decided by a touchdown or less. The most recent game was in 2011, with Alabama winning 27‚Äì11. It was the final loss for long-time Penn State head coach Joe Paterno. Alabama leads the series 10‚Äì5. Official record (including any NCAA imposed vacates and forfeits) against all current SEC opponents as of the completion of the 2024 season.[92] This is a partial list of the ten most recent bowl seasons in which Alabama competed. Alabama has an overall bowl record of 46‚Äì29-3 (78 games) through the 2024 season.[93][94] Eight former Alabama football players have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the fourth most among all colleges.[95] Source:[96] During the football season, the Crimson Tide Sports Network (CTSN) broadcasts multiple shows on gameday for most sports. The network includes more than 60 radio stations across the country. Radio stations WFFN-FM, WTSK-AM as a backup, broadcast all home games in the Tuscaloosa area.[97] Football radio broadcasts begin three hours prior to the game's designated kickoff time with Chris Stewart and Tyler Watts in Around the SEC.[98] The radio broadcast then moves to the Crimson Tide Tailgate Party hosted by Tom Roberts.[98] Immediately following the end of the game, the Fifth Quarter Show begins as host Eli Gold talks to coaches and players and gives game statistics.[98] For the 2008 season, former Alabama players and personalities were brought on to provide guest commentary for each broadcast.[99] Current radio staff:[100][101] Former radio staff: From 1992 to 2023, Alabama played in the West Division of the SEC and played each opponent in the division each year along with several teams from the East Division. The SEC will expand the conference to 16 teams and will eliminate its two divisions in 2024, causing a new scheduling format for the Crimson Tide to play against the other members of the conference.[104] Only the 2024 conference schedule was announced on June 14, 2023, while the conference still considers a new format for the future.[105] Announced schedules as of August 4, 2024.[106]",

                "title": "South Carolina Gamecocks football - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The South Carolina Gamecocks football program represents the University of South Carolina. The Gamecocks compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Southeastern Conference. The team's head coach is Shane Beamer. They play their home games at Williams‚ÄìBrice Stadium. From 1953 through 1970, the Gamecocks played in the Atlantic Coast Conference, finishing No. 14 in the 1958 final AP poll and winning the 1969 ACC Championship. From 1971 through 1991, they competed as a major independent, producing 1980 Heisman Trophy winner George Rogers, six bowl appearances, and final AP top-25 rankings in 1984 and 1987 (No. 11 and No. 15). Since 1992, they have competed in the Southeastern Conference, winning the SEC East Division in 2010 and posting seven final top-25 rankings, including three top-10 finishes and one top-5 finish. South Carolina has produced a National Coach of the Year in Joe Morrison (1984), four SEC coaches of the year in Lou Holtz (2000), Steve Spurrier (2005, 2010), and Shane Beamer (2024), one ACC coach of the year in Paul Dietzel (1969), and two overall #1 NFL Draft picks in George Rogers (1981) and Jadeveon Clowney (2014). They also have five members of the College Football Hall of Fame in former players George Rogers and Sterling Sharpe, and former coaches Holtz and Spurrier as well as former Athletic Director Mike McGee. Carolina fielded its first football team on Christmas Eve, in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1892 versus Furman.[3] At that time the football team was not sanctioned by the university.[3] They provided their own uniforms and paid their own train fare in order to participate in the game.[3] They were nicknamed the \"College Boys\" by The News and Courier and their supporters wore garnet and black.[4] USC won its first game in its third season, on November 2, 1895, against Columbia AA.[3] The squad designated their first head coach, W. H. \"Dixie\" Whaley, the following year.[3] The 1896 season also saw the inaugural game against arch-rival Clemson on November 12, which Carolina won 12‚Äì6.[3] From 1902 to 1903, coach Bob Williams led the Gamecocks to a 14‚Äì3 record.[5] In 1902, South Carolina beat Clemson, coached by John Heisman, for the first time since 1896, the first year of the rivalry.[6] \"The Carolina fans that week were carrying around a poster with the image of a tiger with a gamecock standing on top of it, holding the tiger's tail as if he was steering the tiger by the tail\", Jay McCormick said. \"Naturally, the Clemson guys didn't take too kindly to that, and on Wednesday and again on Thursday, there were sporadic fistfights involving brass knuckles and other objects and so forth, some of which resulted, according to the newspapers, in blood being spilled and persons having to seek medical assistance. After the game on Thursday, the Clemson guys frankly told the Carolina students that if you bring this poster, which is insulting to us, to the big parade on Friday, you're going to be in trouble. And naturally, of course, the Carolina students brought the poster to the parade. If you give someone an ultimatum and they're your rival, they're going to do exactly what you told them not to do.\"[7] As expected, another brawl broke out before both sides agreed to mutually burn the poster in an effort to defuse tensions. The immediate aftermath resulted in the stoppage of the rivalry until 1909.[8][9] 1903 also heralded the program's first 8-win season with an overall record of 8‚Äì2.[5] Future senator and former star player for South Carolina and UVA, Christie Benet led the Gamecocks from 1904 to 1905 and 1908 to 1909.[10] 1904's captain Gene Oliver played against Georgia with a broken jaw.[11] The Board of Trustees banned participation in football for the 1906 season after the faculty complained that the coarseness of chants and cheers, yelled by the students at football games, were not gentlemanly in nature.[12] Within months The Board of Trustees reversed their decision after hearing pleas, and receiving petitions, from students and alumni alike.[13] Play was allowed to resume in 1907.[13] A hastily assembled football team, coached by Board of Trustees member Douglas McKay, competed in an abbreviated season that same year, and the squad won all three games.[14] In 1910, South Carolina hired John Neff from UVA.[15] Norman B. Edgerton coached the team from 1912 to 1915.[16] A. B. Stoney played on the team.[17] Yet another UVA grad, W. Rice Warren coached the 1916 team.[18] Frank Dobson led the war-torn 1918 team to a 2‚Äì1‚Äì1 record.[19] Coach Sol Metzger led the 1921 team to a 5‚Äì1‚Äì2 record, losing only to Billy Laval's Furman.[20] Branch Bocock coached the 1925 and 1926 teams.[21] Billy Laval, a Columbia native, came to USC from Furman.[22] Laval accepted a three-year contract worth $8,000 per year to coach the Gamecocks, which made him the highest-paid coach in the state.[23] From 1928 to 1934, he led the Gamecocks to seven consecutive winning seasons and a 39‚Äì26‚Äì6 overall record, which included a perfect 3‚Äì0 Southern Conference campaign in 1933. Laval is one of only two South Carolina football coaches to have produced seven consecutive winning seasons (Steve Spurrier is the other, from 2008 to 2014).[24] In 2009, The State called him \"the greatest collegiate coach\" in the history of South Carolina.[23] Laval left USC after six seasons to coach multiple sports at Emory and Henry College, partly due to differences over his contract with the USC athletics department.[23] 1934 was the first season that Williams‚ÄìBrice Stadium was used.[25] Prior to this, South Carolina played its home games on the school's campus.[26] Don McCallister led the Gamecocks for three seasons before being replaced. His final record is 13‚Äì20‚Äì1.[27] Under coach Rex Enright, who came to USC from his post as an assistant coach at Georgia,[28] the Gamecocks produced another undefeated Southern Conference season, (4‚Äì0‚Äì1), in 1941.[29] After the 1942 season, Enright joined the United States Navy serving as a lieutenant and working mostly in their athletic program in the United States.[28] After three head coaches (James P. Moran, Williams Newton, John D. McMillan) who had gone 10‚Äì10‚Äì5 combined in four years with one bowl appearance, Enright returned to the Gamecocks in 1946 as head football coach, and remained until 1955 when he resigned for health reasons.[28] He hired Warren Giese as his successor, and continued as athletic director until 1960. The Rex Enright Athletic Center on the South Carolina campus was named for him and the Rex Enright Award (also known as the Captain's Cup) given to the football captains of the previous season.[28] Enright gave-up his coaching duties in 1955 due to reasons related to poor health.[28] Enright retired with the distinction of being the head coach with the most wins and losses in school history (64‚Äì69‚Äì7), and he still retains the record for most school losses and is 2nd in wins.[28] Warren Giese, who was previously an assistant coach at Maryland, was hired as head coach in 1956,[30] and he led the Gamecocks to a 28‚Äì21‚Äì1 overall record in his 5-year tenure.[31] Giese employed a conservative, run-first game strategy, but he enthusiastically adopted the two-point conversion when it was made legal in 1958. That year, he also correctly predicted the rise of special teams after the NCAA relaxed its player substitution rules.[32] The Giese era included two 7‚Äì3 campaigns (1956 and 1958),[31] an 18‚Äì15‚Äì1 ACC record, and a 27‚Äì21 victory over Darrell Royal's 1957 Texas squad in Austin. Griese was replaced after a 3‚Äì6 season in 1960. Marvin Bass was hired away from Georgia Tech, where he served as defensive coordinator, as the Gamecocks head football coach.[33] He posted a 17‚Äì29‚Äì4 record in his four-year tenure and was replaced after five seasons due to the team's struggles and low fan support.[33][34] Paul Dietzel arrived in Columbia prior to the 1966 season, having previously coached at LSU, where he won a national championship, and Army.[35] In 1969, he led the Gamecocks to an ACC championship and an appearance in the Peach Bowl. As a result, Dietzel was named ACC Coach of the Year that season.[35] Soon after, South Carolina left the ACC and became an Independent program prior to the 1971 season.[36] Dietzel finished his USC tenure with a 42‚Äì53‚Äì1 overall record (18‚Äì10‚Äì1 ACC).[35] In addition to the 1969 ACC title, Dietzel's legacies at Carolina include his improvement of athletic facilities and his penning of a new fight song, which is still used to this day (\"The Fighting Gamecocks Lead the Way\").[37] Amid growing fan unrest after an upset loss to Duke, Dietzel announced that he would resign at the end of the season, which ended in a 4‚Äì7 record.[38] Jim Carlen, previously head football coach at Texas Tech and West Virginia, took over as coach in 1975.[39] Under his leadership the program achieved a measure of national prominence. Carlen led the Gamecocks to three bowl games,[39] coached 1980 Heisman Trophy winner George Rogers, and produced a 45‚Äì36‚Äì1 record during his tenure.[36] The Carlen Era included consecutive 8‚Äì4 finishes (1979‚Äì1980) and only one losing season in seven years.[39] The 1980 season was headlined by senior running back George Rogers, who led the nation in rushing with 1,894 yards. For his efforts, the Downtown Athletic Club named Rogers the winner of the 1980 Heisman Trophy award. Rogers beat out a strong group of players, including Georgia running back Herschel Walker. Behind the Rogers-led rushing attack, the Gamecocks went 8‚Äì4 overall and earned an appearance in the Gator Bowl. In addition, the 1980 Gamecocks defeated a heavily favored Michigan squad coached by the legendary Bo Schembechler. The 17‚Äì14 victory in Ann Arbor, which made Rogers a household name, was one of the biggest wins in both the Carlen Era and the program's history. Carlen retired from coaching after seven seasons at USC.[40] Joe Morrison was hired in 1983 following a one-year stint by Richard Bell.[41] After a 5‚Äì6 mark in his first year, the \"Man in Black\" led South Carolina to a 10‚Äì2 record, No. 11 final AP Poll ranking, and a Gator Bowl appearance in 1984. It was also before the 1984 season began that the team removed the Astroturf that had been in place at Williams‚ÄìBrice Stadium since the early 1970s and reinstalled the natural grass that remains today. The 1984 season included victories over Georgia, Pittsburgh, Notre Dame, Florida State, and Clemson. The 1984 defense was called the \"Fire Ant\" defense. In 1987, the Gamecocks posted an 8‚Äì4 record, No. 15 Final AP Poll ranking, and another Gator Bowl trip.[42] The 1987 Gamecocks were led by the \"Black Death\" defense, which held seven opponents to 10 or fewer points and yielded just 141 points in 12 games played.[43] Morrison coached his last game in the 1988 Liberty Bowl,[42] as he died of a heart attack on February 5, 1989, at the age of 51.[41] He finished his USC tenure with a 39‚Äì28‚Äì2 overall record, three bowl appearances, and three seasons with 8 or more wins.[36][42] Due to his on-field success and \"Black Magic\" image (he traditionally wore all black on the sideline and introduced black uniforms into the team's rotation), Morrison remains a popular figure in Gamecock lore.[44] Morrison also began the tradition at Carolina, with his first game in 1983, of the pre-game entrance of the football team being the beginning of Also sprach Zarathustra, the theme from the film 2001: A Space Odyssey.[45] This is still part of the Carolina football game day experience over 40 years later.[46] Following Morrison's death, Sparky Woods was hired away from Appalachian State as head coach in 1989 and coached the Gamecocks until the end of the 1993 season.[47] He posted winning seasons in 1989 and 1990, but could not produce another winning campaign during his tenure.[47] Woods led the USC football program through the transition to the SEC and has the distinction of being South Carolina's first head coach in SEC play, as the Gamecocks entered the conference in 1992. Woods' overall record at South Carolina was 25‚Äì27‚Äì3.[47] Brad Scott left his post as offensive coordinator at Florida State and took over as the Gamecocks head coach in December 1993.[48] Despite modest preseason expectations, he led USC to a 7‚Äì5 record and a Carquest Bowl victory over West Virginia in his first season.[49] The bowl win was the first post-season victory in the program's long history. However, Scott was unable to capitalize on his early success. USC only had one non-losing record in SEC play during his tenure, only one other winning overall record, and won only six games in his final two seasons.[36] Scott was fired by athletics director Mike McGee after a 1‚Äì10 season in 1998 in which the Gamecocks lost their final ten games of the season.[50] Scott's final record at South Carolina was 23‚Äì32‚Äì1 in five seasons.[49] Former Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz came out of retirement and was hired as USC's head coach in 1999.[51] He inherited a relatively young SEC program (joined in 1992) that posted only three winning seasons from 1990 to 1998.[52] USC won just a single game the year before Holtz's arrival and, subsequently, went 0‚Äì11 in his inaugural campaign.[53] It didn't take long for Holtz to improve the Gamecocks' fortunes, however, as he engineered 8‚Äì4 and 9‚Äì3 records in the 2000 and 2001 seasons.[54] In addition, USC won consecutive Outback Bowls over Ohio State and produced the most successful two-year run in program history (at the time), going 17‚Äì7 overall and 10‚Äì6 in SEC play.[54] The 2000 and 2001 campaigns also saw USC's return to the polls, as the Gamecocks turned in No. 19 and No. 13 rankings in the Final AP ballots for those years.[55][56] After consecutive 5‚Äì7 finishes in 2002 and 2003 (in which the team was ranked in the Top 25 during both seasons),[54] Holtz ended his USC tenure on a winning note with a 6‚Äì5 record in 2004[54] before retiring again.[57] Holtz finished with a 33‚Äì37 overall record at South Carolina.[36][54] In 2005, USC was placed on 3 years probation by the NCAA for actions during the coaching tenure of Lou Holtz,[58] all of which were self-reported by the school.[59] Five of these actions were considered major violations, and included such activities as impermissible tutoring and non-voluntary summer workouts as well as a \"lack of institutional control\".[60] Coach Holtz pointed out following the close of the investigation, \"There was no money involved. No athletes were paid. There were no recruiting inducements. No cars. No jobs offered. No ticket scandal, etc.\"[61] Former Washington Redskins and Florida head coach Steve Spurrier was hired in 2005 to replace the retiring Lou Holtz.[62][63] Spurrier led the Gamecocks to a 7‚Äì5 record and Independence Bowl appearance in his first season.[64] As a result, Spurrier was named the 2005 SEC Coach of the Year.[64] The 2006 season saw an 8‚Äì5 record and a victory over Houston in the Liberty Bowl. In 2007, the Gamecocks started the season 6‚Äì1, but would lose all of their next five games.[65] South Carolina posted consecutive 7‚Äì6 records in 2008 and 2009, returning to postseason play with appearances in the Outback Bowl and PapaJohns.com Bowl. They also defeated a Top 5 opponent for the first time ever in 2009 when they upset then-No. 4 Ole Miss 16‚Äì10 at home on a Thursday night.[64] In 2010, Spurrier scored another first with the first SEC Eastern Division Championship in school history[66] and the program's first win over a No. 1 team in program history, with a 35‚Äì21 victory over top-ranked, defending national champion Alabama.[67] In 2011, Spurrier led USC to its most successful season in program history.[68] The Gamecocks posted an 11‚Äì2 overall record, went 6‚Äì2 in SEC play,[64] and defeated No. 20 Nebraska in the Capital One Bowl[69] to earn Final Top 10 rankings in the AP and Coaches' Polls (No. 9 and No. 8, respectively). The University of South Carolina was investigated in 2011‚Äì12 by the NCAA regarding an estimated $59,000 in impermissible benefits provided to student-athletes including football players including discounted living expenses at a local hotel.[70] The school imposed its own punishment, paying $18,500 in fines and cutting three football scholarships in each of the 2013 and 2014 seasons, and reduction in official recruiting visits for the 2012‚Äì13 year.[71] The NCAA accepted these self-imposed punishments.[72] In 2012 Steve Spurrier, once again, led his South Carolina football team to double-digit wins during the course of the regular season campaign.[64] The 2012 regular season culminated with the annual season-ending game against arch-rival Clemson at Clemson's Memorial Stadium.[73][74] In 2013, Spurrier and the Gamecocks finished with another extremely successful 11‚Äì2 season capped by a 34‚Äì22 victory over the No. 19 Wisconsin in the 2014 Capital One Bowl.[75][76][77] South Carolina finished with the highest ranking in school history in the AP poll, ranked at No. 4 in the country.[76] On October 12, 2015, after a 2‚Äì4 start to the season, Spurrier announced to his team that he would be resigning, effective immediately.[78] Offensive line coach/co-offensive coordinator Shawn Elliott was named the team's interim head coach.[79] Elliott led the Gamecocks to victory the following week against Vanderbilt but lost the final five games of the season.[80] Many of South Carolina's most successful seasons came during the Steve Spurrier era, including a SEC East Division championship in 2010 and three consecutive eleven win seasons (2011‚Äì13).[81] Spurrier also boasted a 6‚Äì4 record against the school's in-state rival, Clemson, including five consecutive wins during the 2009‚Äì2013 seasons.[82] Auburn defensive coordinator and former Florida head coach Will Muschamp was named as South Carolina's new head coach on December 6, 2015.[10][83] The Will Muschamp era began with a victory over Vanderbilt by a score of 13‚Äì10.[84] After a 2‚Äì4 start, Carolina won four of their final six regular season contests, including a 24‚Äì21 victory over 18th-ranked Tennessee.[85] The Gamecocks' 2016 campaign ended with a 46‚Äì39 overtime loss to South Florida in the 2016 Birmingham Bowl.[86] In 2017 Muschamp led the Gamecocks to a 9‚Äì4 season.[87] The season started with a neutral site win against NC State in the Belk Kickoff Game in Charlotte, North Carolina.[88] In conference play South Carolina defeated five SEC schools: Florida, Tennessee, Missouri, Vanderbilt, and Arkansas, finishing second in the SEC East.[89] They finished the season with a 26‚Äì19 victory over Michigan in the Outback Bowl.[90][91][92] The 2018 season saw Muschamp and the Gamecocks finish with a 7‚Äì5 regular season finish and a 28‚Äì0 loss to Virginia in the Belk Bowl in Charlotte, NC. South Carolina finished the 2019 season with a mark of 4‚Äì8, highlighted by a road upset over Georgia. The 2020 season was played with a conference-only schedule, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The Gamecocks started off the season 2-2, with a win over then No. 15 Auburn. The Gamecocks then lost three straight, allowing 159 points in the process. Muschamp was dismissed as head coach on November 15, 2020, after starting the 2020 season with a 2‚Äì5 record with Mike Bobo being named interim head coach for the rest of the season.[93][94] On December 6, 2020, University of South Carolina athletic director Ray Tanner announced that the school had hired Oklahoma associate head coach/tight ends coach Shane Beamer as its head coach.[95] Beamer, the son of legendary Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer,[96] led the 2021 Gamecocks to a 7‚Äì6 record, including a 38‚Äì21 win in the Duke's Mayo Bowl over North Carolina.[97] The Gamecocks' 2022 season displayed significant growth under Shane Beamer's leadership in his second year as head coach. Despite inconsistent offensive line play and a lackluster rush defense throughout the season, the Gamecocks finished on a high note, posting an 8‚Äì5 record and finishing the season ranked at No. 23 in both the Coaches and AP poll, their first top 25 finish since the 2013 season.[98] Additionally, Shane Beamer became the first coach in program history to win back-to-back games against top ten opponents after beating #5 Tennessee and their in-state rival #8 Clemson in weeks 12 and 13, respectively.[99] South Carolina's dominant 63‚Äì38 victory against Tennessee set the record for most points scored by an unranked team against a top-five team in college football history.[100] During the same game, South Carolina quarterback Spencer Rattler gave a legendary performance, throwing for 438 passing yards,six touchdowns, and no picks, breaking the school record for most touchdown passes in a single game.[101] The Gamecocks were invited to play against the #21 Notre Dame Fighting Irish in the TaxSlayer Gator Bowl. Although South Carolina played a competitive game with a relatively depleted roster, they ultimately lost to the Irish by a score of 45‚Äì38. The 2023 season saw a setback in the trajectory of the program. Despite quarterback Spencer Rattler and wide receiver Xavier Legette having two of the best individual seasons in school history in their final college year,[102][103][104][105] the team was noted by the media for being heavily affected by injuries, particularly from the offensive line.[106][107][108] South Carolina finished sixth in the final SEC East,[109][110][111] with an overall record of 5‚Äì7, missing a bowl game for the first time since 2020.[112] Shane Beamer achieved massive success with the Gamecocks during the 2024 season, despite media outlets projecting a 13th place finish in the SEC. After a middling 3-3 start to the first half of the season, Beamer turned the page on the narrative and trajectory of the program by leading the team to six straight wins to finish the regular season with a 9-3 record. Beamer set many records over the course of the season, which included leading the Gamecocks to it's first 6-game win streak since 2013, the first winning record in conference play since 2017, and defeated four ranked teams on the season, becoming the very first coach in program history to do so.[113]Season highlights included a dominant 44-20 victory against No. 10 Texas A&M at home, a thrilling 4-point victory over No. 23 Missouri at home - their first victory over that team since 2021, and a 17-14 road victory against archrival, No. 12 Clemson, spearheaded by an elite performance from freshman quarterback LaNorris Sellers. For his outstanding efforts, Shane Beamer was awarded SEC Coach of the year by the Associated Press and USA Today. South Carolina has affiliated with three conferences and twice been an independent.[114][115] South Carolina has had 36 head coaches.[116][117] Shane Beamer became head coach in 2020. ‚Ä† Interim The SEC was split into two divisions from 1992 to 2023, with the Gamecocks competing in the SEC East in that time.[118] South Carolina has 26 bowl appearances, with a 10‚Äì16 record overall.[119] The rivalry is the largest annual sporting event by ticket sales in the state of South Carolina. From 1896 to 1959, the Carolina-Clemson game was played on the fairgrounds in Columbia, South Carolina, and was referred to as \"Big Thursday.\" In 1960, an alternating-site format was implemented utilizing both teams' home stadiums. The annual game has since been officially designated \"The Palmetto Bowl\".[120] It is the 21st most played college football rivalry at 120 meetings. The Gamecocks won 5 in a row against Clemson between 2009 and 2013, Clemson then won 7 straight, but failed to extend their win streak in the series with a 31‚Äì30 loss in 2022. Clemson holds a 73‚Äì43‚Äì4 all-time lead in the series as of the conclusion of the 2023 season. The South Carolina Gamecocks did not play the Clemson Tigers in 2020 due to COVID-19 restrictions. A \"border rivalry\" dating to 1894. The 1980 game was between future Heisman Trophy winners George Rogers and Herschel Walker. Led by Walker's 219 rushing yards, Georgia won 13‚Äì10 and would go on to capture the National Championship. Rogers turned in 168 rushing yards during the course of the battle, setting the stage for a successful finish to his senior season and eventual Heisman Trophy award. The matchup has been televised yearly since 1997. The series has been far more competitive since USC joined the SEC in 1992. Georgia holds a 55‚Äì19‚Äì2 overall lead in the series as of the 2023 season.[121][122] A budding rivalry between the two schools located in cities named Columbia.[123] Although Missouri is the only school to beat the Gamecocks in multiple bowl games, the rivalry began in 2012, when Missouri joined South Carolina in the SEC East. A Mayor's Cup trophy is awarded to the winner of the annual game by the mayors of Columbia, South Carolina and Columbia, Missouri.[124] The rivalry began in 1903. When South Carolina joined the SEC, Tennessee was a common rivalry up until the 2024-2025 season when the SEC got rid of divisions. Tennessee leads the rivalry 29-11-2. This rivalry is famous for having the largest point differential win between an AP top 5 team and an unranked team in 2022 with a score of 63-38. The rivalry began in 1903. While no longer a conference rivalry, since South Carolina left the ACC in 1971, the teams still meet occasionally. In the 2010s, the series had been played primarily on a Thursday. It was announced in September 2015 that USC and UNC will play every four years in 2019 and 2023.[125] South Carolina has won 7 out of the last 9 meetings; North Carolina leads the all-time series 36‚Äì20‚Äì4.[126] The Gamecocks, however have lead the series 13‚Äì7 since 1967, with the Tar Heels' overall lead in the series being reliant on victories from the earlier decades of the matchup. South Carolina and Tennessee first met in 1903, a 10‚Äì0 win for the Gamecocks. The two teams played sparingly, with only 10 meetings total until the SEC's addition of South Carolina in 1992. Since then, the two teams have played annually. The series is notably for its number of streaks, as well as the close nature of the games, with each meeting between 2012 and 2018 being a one score game. After a shocking 24‚Äì23 upset 1992 win for South Carolina, which cost Tennessee the East divisional championship, Tennessee took control of the contests, winning 12 straight. Since Steve Spurrier's first South Carolina team beat Tennessee 16‚Äì15 in 2005, the series is tied 9‚Äì9.[127][128] The series is also known for its recent pattern of win streaks, which have turned several times in the last decade. South Carolina took three straight from 2010 to 2012, followed by won 3 in a row from Tennessee in2013‚Äì2015. The Gamecocks followed this with another three game win streak from 2016 to 2019, before Tennessee again won three in a row from 2019 to 2022 (although two of these victories were later vacated).[129] The series is set to end its annual meetings after the 2023 game due to changes in the SEC schedule caused by the conference's additions of Oklahoma and Texas, as the SEC's 2024 schedule did not pair the teams. That season will be the first since 1991 where the schools do not play.[130] In 1933, under the direction of the legendary Billy Laval, the Gamecocks went undefeated in conference play. However, Duke would finish with a better conference record by one win and was awarded the championship.[131] In 1969, the Gamecocks won the ACC Championship by going undefeated in conference play. In its six ACC matchups, USC outscored its opponents by a 130‚Äì61 margin. The squad posted a 7‚Äì4 overall record with a Peach Bowl appearance against West Virginia to close the season (14‚Äì3 loss). Two years later, South Carolina left the ACC and competed as an Independent for two decades before joining the SEC in 1992. In 1980, the Gamecocks had a successful season led by running back George Rogers, who won the prestigious Heisman Trophy and was chosen #1 overall in the 1981 NFL draft. The team finished 8‚Äì4, with the biggest win coming against the eventual Big Ten champion Michigan Wolverines in front of a crowd of over 104,000 at Michigan Stadium. Led by Coach Morrison, the 1984 Gamecocks became the first team in school history to win 10 games (10‚Äì2 record) and were ranked as high as No. 2 in the polls before losing to an unranked Navy team 38‚Äì21 in the 10th game of the season. The Gamecocks finished No. 11 in the final AP Poll. Along the way, they defeated Georgia, Pittsburgh, Notre Dame, Florida State, and Clemson to earn an appearance in the Gator Bowl against Oklahoma State (21‚Äì14 loss). At the time, the No. 11 final ranking was the highest ever achieved by South Carolina. The team was nicknamed \"Black Magic\" due to their success and their distinctive black jerseys.[132] South Carolina made one of the biggest turnarounds in college football history, going from a winless season in 1999 to an eight-win campaign in 2000. Their first win of the season, against New Mexico State, came two years to the day after their previous win, against Ball State on September 2, 1998. South Carolina's turnaround in conference play was also one of the biggest in SEC history, going from 0‚Äì8 in 1999, to 5‚Äì3 in 2000 including a victory against a heavily favored Georgia team that ended the Gamecocks' SEC losing streak. South Carolina fans tore down the goalposts at Williams-Brice Stadium on both occasions in celebration. On New Year's Day 2001, the Gamecocks defeated Ohio State in the Outback Bowl in Tampa, Florida. South Carolina finished the season ranked #19 in the AP Poll and #21 in the Coaches Poll. In 2010, the Gamecocks won their first SEC Eastern Division Championship, going 5‚Äì3 in conference play.[133] For the first time in school history, they defeated the No. 1 ranked team in the country (Alabama) and won at Florida in the division-clinching game.[133] The season also included victories over division foes Georgia, Tennessee, and Vanderbilt as well as instate Atlantic Coast Conference rival Clemson.[133] In their first appearance in the SEC Championship Game, the Gamecocks lost to No. 1 Auburn, 56‚Äì17. Led by Coach Spurrier, the 2011 Gamecocks achieved its most wins in a single season and finished in the Top 10 for the first time in program history. USC posted an 11‚Äì2 overall record, went 6‚Äì2 in SEC play, and won the Capital One Bowl to finish No. 9/8 in the final AP and Coaches' Polls (respectively). Along the way, USC defeated Georgia, Tennessee, Florida, and Clemson to extend its winning streak over its biggest rivals to 3 games. This was also the first season that USC posted a 5‚Äì0 record against their SEC Eastern Division opponents. Spurrier's 2012 Gamecocks went 11‚Äì2, with their only losses coming at LSU and at Florida in consecutive weeks. USC defeated rival Clemson 27‚Äì17 in Death Valley to end the regular season. They then defeated Michigan 33‚Äì28 in the 2013 Outback Bowl with the game decided by a 28-yard touchdown pass from Dylan Thompson to Bruce Ellington with under a minute to go. The Gamecocks finished the season ranked No. 8/7 in the final AP and Coaches' Polls respectively. Again led by Coach Spurrier, the 2013 Gamecocks went 11‚Äì2, with their losses coming at Georgia and at Tennessee. Notable wins included Vanderbilt, UCF, and Missouri all of which finished ranked in the top 25. USC finished the regular season by defeating rival Clemson 31‚Äì17, marking Carolina's fifth straight win over their in-state rival. This was also the first Palmetto Bowl between top ten teams, with Carolina and Clemson ranked No. 10 and No. 6 respectively. South Carolina also completed their second consecutive season with an undefeated record on their home field, Williams‚ÄìBrice Stadium. The Gamecocks' 18 game home win streak, dating back to the 2011 season, was good for the longest home winning streak in the nation at the time. The team ended the season with a 34‚Äì24 victory over Wisconsin in the 2014 Capital One Bowl. The Gamecocks finished the season ranked No. 4 in both the final AP and Coaches' polls, marking the first top five finish in program history. The Gamecocks posted an 8‚Äì5 record and finished the season ranked at No. 23 in both the Coaches and AP poll, their first top 25 finish since the 2013 season. Shane Beamer became the first coach in program history to win back-to-back games against top ten opponents after beating #5 Tennessee and their in-state rival #8 Clemson. South Carolina's dominant 63‚Äì38 victory against Tennessee set the record for most points scored by an unranked team against a top-five team in college football history. Predicted to win five games and finish thirteenth in the SEC,[134][135] South Carolina achieved the eighth nine-win season in program history.[136] The Gamecocks recorded their first 5‚Äì3 conference record since 2017 and the first of Beamer's tenure.[137] They defeated three conference opponents on the road for the first time since 2011.[138] Shane Beamer broke the record for most wins in the first four seasons by a Gamecock head coach,[139] and he was named the SEC Coach of the Year.[140][141][142] Following a disappointing and controversial first half of the season,[134][143] which saw close losses to LSU and Alabama as well as a blowout loss to Ole Miss,[144] the Gamecocks won the last six games in the regular season.[144] In this stretch, South Carolina defeated four straight conference opponents for the first time since 2005;[a] they also defeated four ranked teams and won all three trophy games for the first time in program history.[144][146][147] Two of those trophy games were decided by late-game touchdowns.[148][149] The winning streak earned South Carolina consideration for the College Football Playoff,[150][151][139][152] but they were instead selected to play Illinois in the Citrus Bowl.[153] The Gamecocks are led by redshirt freshman quarterback LaNorris Sellers as well as a defense that ranks among the best in the nation and school history.[152][154][155] Kyle Kennard won the Bronko Nagurski Trophy, honoring him as the top defensive player in college football, and was a finalist for the Lombardi Award.[156][157] Dylan Stewart is a finalist for the Shaun Alexander Freshman of the Year Award.[158] Following the regular season, Sellers began receiving consideration as one of the best players in the country.[159][139] From 2003 to 2006, Syvelle Newton played multiple positions for the Gamecocks and left his mark on the national record books in the process. He became one of only four players in college football history to record 600+ yards passing, rushing, and receiving (each) in a collegiate career.[164] In Newton's four seasons, he posted 2,474 passing yards (20 TD, 13 INT), 786 rushing yards (10 TD), and 673 receiving yards (3 TD). He also returned 6 kickoffs for 115 yards (19.2 average) and made 18 tackles and an assisted sack in limited defensive action. Garnet and black have been South Carolina‚Äôs uniform colors of choice throughout the program‚Äôs history.[182] The gamecock first appeared on South Carolina‚Äôs helmet in 1966, and has remained on the helmet in some form since 1969.[182][183] Since 1975, South Carolina has used the 'Block C' primary logo on its helmets,[182][183] and has intermittently featured the script \"Carolina\" and \"Gamecocks\" on the front of its jerseys.[citation needed] While the jersey used \"Gamecocks\" for much of the 1980s and early 1990s, it has solely used \"Carolina\" on its jersey since the late 1990s.[citation needed] Also, as South Carolina's flagship university,[137][184][185][134] USC prominently displays the state flag, and imagery derived from it.[186][187] Since 2007, South Carolina has partnered with Under Armour as its official uniform supplier, replacing Russell Athletic. Under Armour has modified the Gamecocks‚Äô look several times, with altered piping, varying font sizes, et cetera.[182] For example, before the 2013 season, a new uniform was unveiled with eleven total stripes, the same number of buildings on The Horseshoe, the most famous part of the South Carolina campus and a national historic landmark.[188] In 2016, South Carolina signed a ten-year extension with Under Armour, which at the time was reportedly the second-most valuable deal in the SEC and seventh-most valuable in the nation. This deal will expire on June 30, 2026.[189][190][191] In support of the Wounded Warrior Project, USC wore a special uniform against Florida in 2009, against Auburn in 2011, and against LSU in 2012.[192][182] In several seasons, South Carolina has worn \"throwback\" uniforms, including homages to the 1980s in 2019,[193] and to the 1980 season in 2024.[194] The University of South Carolina makes a distinction between retired jerseys and retired numbers. Since 2007, the current athletics department policy states that the school retires jerseys, not numbers. Numbers retired prior to 2007 will continue to be in a retired state, while current and future student-athletes can wear numbers that were affiliated with jersey retirements after 2007.[144] Four players' numbers have been retired, while an additional two players' jerseys have been retired.[195][144][196] As of September 2023, South Carolina had 21 players on active rosters in the NFL, which ranked tied for 21st in the country.[201] The following is a list of Gamecock players in the NFL in any capacity (active rosters, practice squads, reserve lists, et cetera), as of September 2024.[202][203] Sixteen Gamecock players have been selected in the first round of the NFL Draft, which is 44th in the nation, as of 2024.[206][207] From 1992 to 2023, South Carolina played in the East Division of the SEC and played each opponent in the division each year along with several teams from the West Division. The SEC expanded the conference to 16 teams and eliminated its two divisions in 2024, causing a new scheduling format for the Gamecocks to play against the other members of the conference.[208] Only the 2024 conference schedule was announced on June 14, 2023, while the conference still considers a new format for the future.[209] Announced schedules as of August 26, 2024.[210] ‚Ä†‚Ä† Will be played at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia Seifried, C.S., & Bolton, C.

The 111th annual Rose Bowl game will be one of the College Football Playoff (CFP) quarterfinals and will feature top-ranked Oregon and sixth-ranked Ohio State, both members of the Big Ten Conference. The game is scheduled to begin at 2:00 p.m. PST. The Rose Bowl will be one of the 2024‚Äì25 bowl games concluding the 2024 FBS football season.[2][3] Sponsored by the Prudential financial service company, the game is officially known as the College Football Playoff Quarterfinal at the 2025 Rose Bowl Game presented by Prudential. The 2025 Rose bowl is a quarterfinal game for the College Football Playoff (CFP).[4] Oregon, being the top-ranked team in the final CFP rankings and winner of the Big Ten Championship Game, received a bye in the new 12-team format of the CFP and was selected to play in the bowl game. Sixth-ranked Ohio State, the number eight seed in the tournament, defeated Tennessee in the first round, 42‚Äì17, to advance to this game. This will be the 12th all-time meeting between Ohio State and Oregon, as well as their first post-season meeting since the 2015 (inaugural) CFP National Championship game in Arlington, which Ohio State won 42‚Äì20.[5] It will also be their third meeting in the Rose Bowl, following the 1958 and 2010 editions of the game back when the game traditionally matched the Big Ten and Pac-12 (or their predecessors') champions against each other. The Buckeyes won both times, but the Ducks won the teams' meeting earlier in the season in Week 7 at Autzen Stadium 32‚Äì31.[5] The winner of the Rose Bowl will advance in the playoff to the Cotton Bowl Classic to face the winner of the Peach Bowl.[6] Following the 1958 Rose Bowl, a sapling of a yellow aesculus (buckeye tree), the namesake of the state of Ohio, was given to Oregon and planted outside the Lillis Business complex, where it still stands.[7] This will be the ninth Rose Bowl appearance for the Ducks, who enter the game with a 4‚Äì4 record in prior appearances.[8] Their most recent prior appearance was the 2020 game, a win over Wisconsin.[8] Oregon enters the game as the Big Ten Conference champions with an 13‚Äì0 record (9‚Äì0 in conference), their first season in the conference.[9] Ohio State is 9‚Äì7 in prior Rose Bowl appearances, with their last appearance coming in the 2022 edition, a three-point victory over Utah. The Buckeyes come into this game with an 11‚Äì2 record following their 42‚Äì17 first-round win over Tennessee.

                "content": "The Ohio State Buckeyes football team competes as part of the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision, representing Ohio State University in the Big Ten Conference. Ohio State has played its home games at Ohio Stadium in Columbus, Ohio, since 1922.[3] The Buckeyes are recognized by the university and NCAA as having won eight national championships,[4] including six from the major wire-service selectors: AP Poll and/or Coaches' Poll. The program has also captured 41 conference championships (2 OAC and 39 Big Ten), 10 division championships, and has compiled 10 undefeated seasons, including six perfect seasons (no losses or ties). Seven players have received the Heisman Trophy (second all-time), with the program holding the distinction of having the only two-time winner (Archie Griffin) of the award. As of 2017, the football program is valued at $1.5‚Äì2 billion,[5][6] the highest valuation of any such program in the country. NCAA's first millionaire student-athlete (Quinn Ewers) became such using NIL while in the program. After early attempts at forming a team in 1886 (led by future Nebraska governor Chester Hardy Aldrich) and 1887, football was ultimately established at the university in 1890.[7] On the site of the first OSU game, on the campus of Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio, on May 3, 1890, the Delaware County Historical Society has set an historical marker.[8] Some histories of Ohio State football credit George Cole, an undergraduate, and Alexander S. Lilley with introducing the sport to the campus. More recent research has challenged that claim, stating that George Cole did not persuade Lilley to coach the football team until after its first full season began that fall.[8] OSU's first home game took place at 2:30 p.m. on November 1, 1890. They played the University of Wooster on the site that was then called Recreation Park. Just east of historic German Village, the park occupied the north side of Schiller (now Whittier), between Ebner and Jaeger, in what is now Schumacher Place. OSU lost the game, 64‚Äì0. Over the next eight years, under a number of coaches, the team played to a cumulative record of 31 wins, 39 losses, and 2 ties. The first game against the University of Michigan, in Ann Arbor, was a 34‚Äì0 loss in 1897, a year that saw the low point in Buckeye football history with a 1‚Äì7‚Äì1 record. Jack Ryder was Ohio State's first paid coach, earning $150 per season, and lost his first game, against Oberlin College and John Heisman, on October 15, 1892.[9] In 1899 the university hired John Eckstorm to bring professional coaching skills to the program and immediately went undefeated.[10] In 1901, however, center John Sigrist was fatally injured in a game against Western Reserve University and the continuation of football at Ohio State was in serious question. Although the school's athletic board let the team decide its future, Eckstorm resigned.[11] In 1912, football underwent a number of developments that included joining the Western Conference, making football as part of a new Department of Athletics, and hiring Lynn W. St. John to be athletic director. Chic Harley attended East High in Columbus and was regarded as one of the greatest players to attend an Ohio high school. A well-rounded player, Harley came to Ohio State in 1916 and instantly became a fan favorite. Harley and the Buckeyes won the first Big Ten championship in school history in 1916, finishing 7‚Äì0. The team would repeat in 1917 finishing 8‚Äì0‚Äì1. In 1918, Harley left to be a pilot in the U.S. Army Air Service during World War I. With Harley's return in 1919, the Buckeyes would only lose one game, to Illinois. Harley left OSU with a career record of 22‚Äì1‚Äì1. At the time, OSU played at the small Ohio Field and Harley brought such record crowds it became necessary to open Ohio Stadium in 1922. The stadium was built entirely on fan donations and several stadium drives around the city where Harley would often appear. In 1951, when the College Football Hall of Fame opened, Harley was inducted as an inaugural member. Ohio State's first rival was Kenyon College, a small liberal arts college in Gambier, roughly 50 miles to the northeast. The Buckeyes first played them in their first season in 1890 on Nov 27, Kenyon won the first two meetings; however, Ohio State won 15 in a row and the rivalry diminished. Kenyon made it their season goal to defeat OSU. After the Bucks joined the Big Ten they stopped playing Kenyon. The all-time record stands at 17‚Äì6, OSU.[12] In hiring Francis Schmidt in March 1934 to coach its football team, Ohio State moved its program to a \"big-time\" level of competition. Schmidt was a well-established coach and an acknowledged offensive innovator. His offensive schemes were a \"wide-open\" style called \"razzle-dazzle\" and led him to be the first Buckeye football coach granted a multi-year contract. Schmidt's first four seasons saw victories over archrival Michigan, all by shut-out. The 1935 squad went 7‚Äì1, its sole loss was to Notre Dame, 18‚Äì13, in the first contest between the programs. However Schmidt's remaining seasons were less successful, except in 1939 when the Buckeyes won the Big Ten championship, and his popularity faded for a number of reasons.[13] On December 17, 1940, he resigned. Ohio State hired the coach of Massillon Washington High School football team, Paul Brown, to succeed Schmidt.[14][15] Brown's Tigers had just won their sixth straight state championship. Brown immediately changed Ohio State's style of offense, planned and organized his program in great detail, and delegated to his assistant coaches using highly structured practices. In 1942, Ohio State lost 22 veteran players to military service as the United States joined World War II, and with a team of mostly sophomores went on to lose only once in winning its first national championship. Brown accepted a commission in the United States Navy in 1944, ending his coaching run prior to the season. When Brown went into the Navy, he directed his assistant Carroll Widdoes to head the team in his absence. The 1944 team fielded 31 freshmen but went undefeated and untied, including a victory over Paul Brown's Great Lakes Navy team. Ohio State finished second in the national rankings behind Army and Les Horvath became the first Buckeye to be awarded the Heisman Trophy. Also prominent on the 1942‚Äì44 teams was the first Buckeye African American star, Bill Willis. Brown chose not to return to Ohio State after the war, going into professional football instead. Widdoes, despite having the highest two-year winning percentage of any Buckeye coach, asked to return to an assistant's position. Offensive coordinator Paul Bixler and Widdoes switched positions, and Bixler endured a mediocre 4‚Äì3‚Äì2 season. Bixler resigned and talk of Ohio State being a \"graveyard of coaches\" became commonplace, a reputation that lingered for decades.[16] Wes Fesler became head coach in 1947 but finished last in the Big Ten for the only time in team history. Ohio State improved greatly in 1948, winning 6 and losing 3, then in 1949 enjoyed a successful season due to the play of sophomore Vic Janowicz. Ohio State received the Rose Bowl invitation, where they came from behind to defeat California. In 1950, Fesler, rumored to be resigning because of pressures associated with the position and abuse of his family by anonymous critics, returned to coach the Buckeyes, who won six games in a row to move into the top ranking in the AP poll. However, the season fell apart as the Buckeyes lost to Michigan during a blizzard, a game that came to be known as the \"Snow Bowl\". Two weeks later, citing concerns about his health and family, Fesler resigned. Wayne Woodrow \"Woody\" Hayes beat out Paul Brown,[17] among others, to be named head coach on February 18, 1951. He instituted a demanding practice regimen and was both aggressive and vocal in enforcing it, alienating many players accustomed to Fesler's laid-back style. The 1951 Buckeyes won 4, lost 3, and tied 2, leaving many to question the ability of the new coach. In 1952, the team improved to 6‚Äì3 and recorded their first victory over Michigan in eight years, but after a 1953 loss to Michigan, critics called for the replacement of Hayes. In 1954, the Buckeyes were picked to finish no higher than 10th in the Big Ten. Hayes, however, had the talents of Howard \"Hopalong\" Cassady, and a historic goal-line stand against Michigan propelled Ohio State to a perfect season. Hayes led the powerhouse Buckeyes to a shared national championship (his first and the team's second). In 1955 the team again won the Big Ten, set an attendance record, and won in Ann Arbor for the first time in 18 years, while Hopalong Cassady was securing the Heisman Trophy. Ohio State passed only three times against Michigan (the sole reception was the only completion in the final three games of the year), leading to the characterization of Hayes' style of offensive play as \"three yards and a cloud of dust\". In a 1955 article in Sports Illustrated, Hayes admitted to making small personal loans to financially needy players.[18] The article resulted in a furor over possible violations of NCAA rules, and the faculty council, followed by the Big Ten and NCAA, conducted lengthy investigations. Big Ten Commissioner Kenneth \"Tug\" Wilson found Hayes and the program guilty of violations and placed it on a year's probation in 1956. In 1957, Ohio State won all of its remaining games after an opening loss to claim the Big Ten championship, then won the Rose Bowl over Oregon, and shared a national title with Auburn, for which Hayes was named Coach of the Year. In 1961, the team went undefeated to be named national champions by the FWAA but a growing conflict between academics and athletics over Ohio State's reputation as a \"football school\" resulted in a faculty council vote to decline an invitation to the Rose Bowl, resulting in much public protest and debate.[19] Over the next 6 seasons, Ohio State finished no higher than 2nd and had a losing season in 1966, and public speculation that Hayes would be replaced as a coach grew to its highest point since 1953. In 1968, Ohio State defeated the number one-ranked Purdue Boilermakers and continued to an undefeated season including a 50‚Äì14 rout of Michigan and a Rose Bowl victory over the USC Trojans that resulted in the national championship. The Class of 1970 became known as the \"super sophomores\" in 1968 and might have gone on to three consecutive national championships except for what may have been the most bitter loss in Buckeye history. The winning streak reached 22 games as Ohio State traveled to Michigan. The Buckeyes were 17-point favorites but directed by first-year coach Bo Schembechler, Michigan shocked the Buckeyes in a 24‚Äì12 upset. The 1969 loss to Michigan initiated what came to be known as \"The Ten Year War\", in which the rivalry, which pitted some of OSU's and UM's strongest teams ever, rose to the uppermost level of all sports and the competition between Schembechler and Hayes became legendary.[20] Four times between 1970 and 1975, Ohio State and Michigan were both ranked in the top five of the AP Poll before their matchup. The Wolverines entered every game during those years undefeated and won only once, a 10‚Äì7 victory in Ann Arbor on November 20, 1971. Both teams used the annual game as motivation for entire seasons and after the initial win by Michigan, played dead even at four wins and a tie apiece. Hayes had the upper hand during the first part of the war, in which Ohio State won the conference championship and went to the Rose Bowl four straight years, while Michigan won the final three. It was also an era in which through television Ohio State football again came to the forefront of national attention. Hayes set the tone in spring practice in 1970, placing a rug at the entrance to the Buckeye dressing room emblazoned with the words: \"1969 MICH 24 OSU 12 ‚Äî 1970 MICH:__ OSU:__\" as a constant reminder of their objective.[21] The \"super sophomores\", now seniors, used a strong fullback-oriented offense to smash their way through the season undefeated, struggling only with Purdue the week before the Michigan game. The return match in Columbus found both teams undefeated and untied, a \"first\" in the history of the rivalry, with Michigan, ranked fourth and Ohio State fifth. Ohio State combined a powerful defense that held Michigan to only 37 yards rushing, a rushing offense employing two tight ends as blockers, and a 26-yard touchdown pass from Kern to Bruce Jankowski to win 20‚Äì9. The Buckeyes returned to the Rose Bowl to be upset by Stanford 27‚Äì17. The \"super sophomores\" had garnered a record of 27‚Äì2, the best winning percentage of any three-year period in team history, and won or shared the Big Ten title all three years. The National Football Foundation named Ohio State as a national co-champion, along with Texas, for 1970 and awarded the teams joint possession of the MacArthur Bowl. 1971 was less successful than the preceding seasons, but the middle four years of the 10-year war saw the greatest success for Hayes against Michigan, although the teams fell short of repeating their 1968 national championship. Archie Griffin began his college football career in 1972, taking advantage of new NCAA eligibility rules that allowed freshmen to compete at the varsity level. In his second game, sent in against North Carolina late in the first quarter, Griffin set a new Buckeye rushing record with 239 yards and led the team in rushing for the season with 867. The following season, Hayes installed an I-formation attack with Griffin at tailback and fellow sophomore Cornelius Greene at quarterback. The Buckeyes went undefeated with a powerful offense and impenetrable defense, achieving an average margin of victory of 31 points a game. The only blemish on their record was a 10‚Äì10 tie with Michigan after both teams had entered the game unbeaten. (The tie was more galling for the Wolverines, however, as the Big Ten selected Ohio State to represent the conference in the Rose Bowl.) Despite soundly defeating defending national champion USC, however, the tie with Michigan resulted in the Buckeyes finishing second to Notre Dame in the final AP rankings. Griffin, Randy Gradishar, Van DeCree, and John Hicks were named All-Americans; Hicks, an offensive tackle, not only won both the Outland and Lombardi Trophies but placed second in the Heisman Trophy competition. 1974 and 1975 were seasons of both elation and frustration. The Buckeyes twice more defeated Michigan, and went to two Rose Bowls, but lost both. The 1974 team seemed bound for another national championship when it was derailed by a loss to unranked Michigan State (Ohio State lost only twice in the regular season during Griffin's four-year career, both to the Spartans), and the next year, the No. 1-ranked Bucks lost 23‚Äì10 to 11th-ranked UCLA in the 1976 Rose Bowl. In all, the Buckeyes were 40‚Äì5‚Äì1 from 1972 to 1975, winning the Big Ten all four years and never losing to Michigan, but it was the losses and ties that proved important to Ohio State missing out on achieving a national championship. At any rate, Archie Griffin rushed for 5,589 yards combined in his four seasons at Ohio State while winning the Heisman Trophy in 1974 (1,695 yards rushed) and 1975 (1,450 yards).[22] The falloff in the success of Hayes' last three years was not great. His teams forged records of 9‚Äì2‚Äì1, 9‚Äì3, and 7‚Äì4‚Äì1, and made bowl appearances in all three years (the rules had changed to allow appearances in other than the Rose Bowl). However, frustrations in losing three straight years to Michigan, and other factors, resulted in growing criticism of Hayes and his methods, particularly his on-the-field fits of temper. Even so, his downfall was sudden and shocking when near the end of the nationally televised Gator Bowl, Hayes punched Clemson middle guard Charlie Bauman after Bauman intercepted a pass to kill Ohio State's last chance to win.[23] Hayes was fired after the game by Ohio State president Harold Enarson and athletic director Hugh Hindman.[24] Hayes was replaced by a former prot√©g√©, Iowa State head coach Earle Bruce.[25] Bruce inherited a strong team led by sophomore quarterback Art Schlichter but that had also lost 11 starters, and the 1979 squad exceeded pre-season expectations, ending the 3-year loss drought against Michigan and going to the Rose Bowl with an opportunity once again to be national champions. The Buckeyes lost both by a single point, 17‚Äì16, but Bruce was named Coach of the Year. His success was hailed by those in the media who saw it as a rebuke of Hayes and the start of a \"new era\".[26] 1980, however, saw the start of a trend that eventually brought criticism to Bruce, when Ohio State finished with a 9‚Äì3 record, the first of six consecutive years at 9‚Äì3. Though each of these seasons, and the 10‚Äì3 season that followed them, culminated in a bowl game, Ohio State did not appear to be any closer to a national championship than during the end of the Hayes era. Bruce's teams were not without impact players, however. All-Americans and future National Football League stars included Keith Byars, Cris Carter, Chris Spielman, John Frank, Jim Lachey, Tom Tupa, Marcus Marek, and Pepper Johnson. His program was also known for the number of notable assistant coaches on staff, including Jim Tressel, Glen Mason, Pete Carroll, Nick Saban, Urban Meyer and Dom Capers. For the first time since 1922, the Buckeyes lost three in a row in Ohio Stadium in 1982, including rematches with Stanford and Florida State, and for the second year in a row to Wisconsin, but then won seven straight, the last over BYU in the Holiday Bowl. Sophomore running back Keith Byars had a stand-out season in 1983, rushing for 1,199 yards, and Ohio State defeated the Oklahoma Sooners in Norman, but three losses in conference meant a 4th-place finish. 1984 witnessed what Bruce called \"the greatest comeback after the worst start\" when Ohio State fell behind Illinois 24‚Äì0 at home but roared back on 274 yards rushing and five touchdowns by Byars to win 45‚Äì38. Ohio State also defeated Michigan to win an outright Big Ten championship. Byars led the nation in rushing and scoring but finished second in Heisman balloting. In 1986, Bruce received a 3-year contract, the first for the modern program but the team opened with two losses, which had not occurred in over 90 years. The Buckeyes then won 9 in a row before Michigan took a close game when kicker Matt Frantz missed a field goal with a minute to play. After the season Bruce was offered the position of head coach at the University of Arizona with a 5-year contract but was persuaded to stay at his alma mater by Athletic Director Rick Bay. Hopes for a standout season in 1987 suffered a serious setback when All-American wide receiver Cris Carter was dropped from the team for signing with an agent. Indiana defeated Ohio State for the first time since 1951, 31‚Äì10, in a game that came to be known as the \"darkest day\",[27] and Ohio State lost three conference games in a row going into the Michigan game. On the Monday of Michigan week, after a weekend of rumors and speculation, Ohio State President Edward Jennings fired Bruce but tried to keep the dismissal secret until after the end of the season. Bay, who had been instrumental in keeping Bruce at Ohio State, disregarded Jennings' orders and announced the firing and his own resignation in protest. Jennings made his own situation worse by refusing to give a reason for the firing and the circumstances have been the subject of controversy since.[28] The Buckeyes enjoyed an emotional come-from-behind victory over Michigan in Ann Arbor after the entire team wore headbands bearing the word \"EARLE\", then declined an invitation to play in the Sun Bowl. John Cooper was hired as the 21st football head coach at Ohio State before the end of 1987 and before he had coached his last game at Arizona State University.[29] Cooper's coaching record at ASU and at Tulsa prior to that stood out among his credentials, as did a victory over Michigan in the 1987 Rose Bowl.[30] Cooper's 13 years as the Buckeye head coach are largely remembered in the litany of negative statistics associated with him: a notorious 2‚Äì10‚Äì1 record against Michigan, a 3‚Äì8 record in bowl games, a 5-year losing streak to Illinois to start his term and a 6‚Äì7 record overall, and blowing a 15-point 3rd quarter lead in a 28‚Äì24 loss to unranked Michigan State when the Buckeyes were the top-ranked team in the nation and en route to a national championship. However, his record also has many positives: back-to-back victories over Notre Dame, two finishes second-ranked in the polls, and three Big Ten championships (albeit shared). Cooper also recruited 15 players who were first-round draft picks in the National Football League.[31] Both 1988 and 1989 began identically: a season-opening win followed by an embarrassing loss to a highly regarded team (Pitt and USC); a rebound win against two other highly regarded programs (LSU and Boston College) followed by a loss to Illinois in the conference opener. However, 1988 saw Ohio State lose its first three conference games and a close game at home against Michigan for a 4‚Äì6‚Äì1 record, its first losing season in 22 years. In 1989 the Buckeyes won 6 consecutive Big Ten games before losing its last two to go 8‚Äì4. The most noteworthy victory occurred in Minneapolis when Ohio State overcame a 31‚Äì0 deficit to Minnesota to win 41‚Äì37. 1990 continued the pattern with a 2-win 2-loss start and an overall 7‚Äì4‚Äì1 record that included an embarrassing loss to Air Force in the Liberty Bowl. 1991 was 8‚Äì4, notable primarily as the season that sophomore running back Robert Smith quit the team. 1992, with senior Kirk Herbstreit at quarterback, and Smith back on the team was 8‚Äì3‚Äì1, but the losing string to Michigan was broken with a 13‚Äì13 tie. Persistent rumors that Cooper would resign or be fired were laid to rest when University President Gordon Gee announced he would be back in 1993.[32] The next six seasons were very successful, winning 10 or more games in five out of six, and sharing the conference championship in three. Eddie George won the Heisman Trophy in 1995 after a tremendous senior season, Ohio State defeated Notre Dame in 1995 and 1996, and won half its bowl games. But in three seasons (1993, 1995, and 1996) the Buckeyes entered the Michigan game undefeated, with the possibility of a national championship in at least one, and lost all three to underdog Wolverine teams. Ohio State had won 62 games and lost only 12, but a third of those were to Michigan. After renewing his contract and becoming a member of the \"million dollar coaching club\",[33] Cooper started sophomore Austin Moherman against the Miami Hurricanes in the nationally televised Kickoff Classic and was soundly beaten. That presaged a mediocre season in which the Buckeyes finished 6‚Äì6, ending their successful 90's run. The 2000 team was more successful, going 8‚Äì4, but criticism of Cooper among fans had risen to a clamor again and touched on many areas of the program beyond specific game records. The negative publicity rose to a peak in the days leading up to Ohio State's matchup with South Carolina in the Outback Bowl, when wide receiver Reggie Germany was suspended for having a 0.0 GPA, team captain Matt Wilhelm publicly criticized fellow player Ken-Yon Rambo, and one Buckeye lineman sued another.[34] On January 3, 2001, Cooper was fired.[35] His loss in the Outback Bowl to a team that had not even won a single game the year before was a factor in his subsequent firing, as was negative publicity regarding player behavior before and during the game. Other contributing factors included the record against Michigan (which was actually considered by most people to be the biggest reason for his firing), a reputation of inability to win \"big games\", the lack of a national championship, the perception of him as an outsider by many alumni, the poor bowl game record, and finally a perceived lack of discipline on the team. Ohio State quickly sought a replacement for Cooper and after a nationwide search hired Jim Tressel.[36] With four NCAA Division I-AA National Championships at Youngstown State University, Tressel, formerly an assistant coach for Earle Bruce, was an Ohioan who was considered to be appreciative of Buckeye football traditions. Although there were some doubts as to whether or not Tressel could repeat his earlier success at the Division 1A level, most fans and alumni met the coaching change with enthusiasm. On the day of his hiring, Jim Tressel, speaking to fans and students at a Buckeye basketball game, made a prophetic implication that he would lead the Buckeyes to beat Michigan in Ann Arbor the following November.[37] Tressel's first season was difficult as the Buckeyes finished 7‚Äì5 (all but one loss was by a touchdown or less), but he made good on his promise, beating Michigan in Ann Arbor. While its fans were optimistic about the chance for success of the 2002 team, most observers were surprised by Ohio State's National Championship.[38][39] Ohio State used strong defense, ball-control play-calling, and field position tactics to win numerous close games, a style of play characterized as \"Tresselball\",[40] and disparaged by detractors as \"the Luckeyes\".[41] The 2006 and 2007 regular seasons ended with just one combined loss and consecutive appearances in the national championship game. The Buckeyes lost both by wide margins. On January 1, 2010, the Buckeyes defeated the Oregon Ducks in The Rose Bowl Game by a score of 26‚Äì17. This ended a 3-game BCS losing streak for Ohio State, having lost 2 national championships and one Tostitos Fiesta Bowl. Terrelle Pryor was named MVP of the contest with 2 touchdown passes for a career-high 266 passing yards. In addition, he had more total yards than the entire Oregon Ducks team. In December 2010, it was announced that five student-athletes on the football team would be suspended for the first five games of the 2011 season for NCAA violations. The punishments stemmed from an incident when some of the Buckeye players received tattoos for their autographs, according to news reports. Other violations committed by the players included the selling of several items given to them by the university, such as Big Ten championship rings.[42] On December 22, 2010, the NCAA announced that five players would be suspended for the first five games of the 2011 season due to receiving improper benefits. Mike Adams, Dan Herron, DeVier Posey, Solomon Thomas, and quarterback Terrelle Pryor were found to have signed autographs in return for tattoos, as well as selling memorabilia given to them by the university.[43] In addition, Jordan Whiting was suspended for the season opener for his involvement. The scandal originated at Fine Line Tattoos and Piercings in Columbus, whose owner, Edward Rife, was being investigated for felony drug trafficking. On January 4, 2011, with all the players allowed to participate by the NCAA, the Buckeyes defeated the Arkansas Razorbacks in the Sugar Bowl by a margin of 31‚Äì26.[44] The win, along with every other one from the 2010 season, would later be vacated due to the scandal. The Buckeyes finished the season 12‚Äì1, with their only official game being a loss to Wisconsin. On March 8, 2011, OSU suspended head coach Jim Tressel for the first 2 games of the 2011 season and fined him $250,000 for not informing the university and the NCAA that he had knowledge of his players receiving improper benefits. Coach Tressel's suspension would later be increased to 5 games by the university. On May 30, 2011, Jim Tressel resigned as head coach of the Buckeyes.[45] On June 6, 2011, a story in Sports Illustrated reported that at least 28 players, including Rob Rose, T. J. Downing, Louis Irizarry, Chris Vance, C. J. Barnett, Dorien Bell, Jamaal Berry, Bo DeLande, Zach Domicone, Storm Klein, Etienne Sabino, John Simon, Nathan Williams, Jermale Hines, Devon Torrence, Donald Washington, Thaddeus Gibson, Jermil Martin, Lamaar Thomas, and Doug Worthington traded team memorabilia or used equipment for tattoos or other merchandise or services between 2002 and 2010. The report alleged that Tressel had violated NCAA bylaw 10.1, unethical conduct, three times by not acting when told of the tattoo improprieties, by signing a statement saying he knew of no violations, and for withholding information on what was going on from university officials.[46] On July 8, 2011, Ohio State University decided to vacate all victories from the 2010 football season as self-imposed punishment for major NCAA violations.[47] Former coach Jim Tressel received more than $52,000 from the university and didn't have to pay a $250,000 fine for his involvement in the scandal. His status was also changed from \"Resigned\" to \"Retired\" in keeping with his wishes to \"remain a Buckeye for life\".[48] Ohio State named Luke Fickell interim head coach for the 2011 season following Tressel's resignation, and Fickell coached the 2011 Buckeyes to a 6‚Äì7 record; going 6‚Äì6 in the regular season and losing in the Gator Bowl to Florida. On November 28, 2011, former University of Florida head coach and ESPN college football analyst Urban Meyer accepted the position of Buckeyes head coach.[49] Meyer assumed head coaching responsibilities following the Buckeyes' January 2012 Gator Bowl appearance. Meyer's first season at Ohio State did not include a postseason contest, as the Buckeyes were sanctioned with a one-year bowl ban on December 20, 2011. The NCAA sanctions also included the loss of three scholarships each year for the following three years and three years' probation to end on December 19, 2014. Ohio State was required to vacate all wins from the 2010 season, the 2010 Big Ten Conference championship and their win in the 2011 Sugar Bowl. The school's share of the Sugar Bowl proceeds was forfeited as well.[50] In Meyer's first year, the Buckeyes went a perfect 12‚Äì0, winning the 2012 Big Ten Leaders Division, though the previously mentioned sanctions kept them from playing in the 2012 Big Ten Football Championship Game and a postseason bowl game.[50] On November 23, 2013, the Buckeyes clinched their second straight Leaders Division Championship, after defeating Indiana 42‚Äì14. With the victory over Indiana, Ohio State set a team record for all-time consecutive wins, with 23. The following week, Ohio State defeated Michigan 42‚Äì41 in Ann Arbor, to increase the streak to 24. The streak ended with Ohio State's 34‚Äì24 loss to Michigan State in the 2013 Big Ten Conference Championship game on December 7, marking Meyer's first loss as the Buckeyes' head coach. On January 3, 2014, the Buckeyes were defeated by Clemson in the Orange Bowl 40‚Äì35. On November 22, 2014, the Buckeyes clinched the first-ever Big Ten East Division Championship when they defeated Indiana 42‚Äì27, earning a berth in the 2014 Big Ten Championship Game, where they defeated West Division champion Wisconsin 59‚Äì0 to win the Big Ten Conference Championship and qualified for the four-team playoff to decide the National Champion. OSU defeated Alabama in the Sugar Bowl 42‚Äì35, on January 1, 2015, to qualify for the National Championship Game against Rose Bowl winner Oregon on January 12 (the Rose and Sugar Bowls were the designated semifinal games in 2014). OSU claimed the first-ever College Football Playoff National Championship by defeating Oregon 42‚Äì20.[51][52][53] The 2015 season for the Buckeyes began with a 10‚Äì0 start before losing on a last-second field goal to Michigan State on November 21, ending the Buckeyes' quest to repeat as National Champions. However, the Buckeyes recovered their 2 next games with dominating wins over Michigan and then over Notre Dame in the Fiesta Bowl to finish the season at 12‚Äì1. The 2016 season started off great with 6 straight victories, including a win over the Oklahoma Sooners, but the streak came to an end as the team lost a heart-breaker to the Penn State Nittany Lions. The Buckeyes went on to win the rest of their regular-season games, finishing 11‚Äì1. They did not play in the Big Ten Championship as Penn State took the division. In a controversial call, the College Football Playoff committee gave Ohio State a spot in the Playoff. Ohio State lost in the Fiesta Bowl to the Clemson Tigers in an embarrassing 31‚Äì0 loss, ending the season 11‚Äì2. The 2017 season started out on a high note with a victory over the Indiana Hoosiers, but the next week the Buckeyes fell to the Oklahoma Sooners. The Buckeyes won the next 6 games, including a win over No. 2 Penn State in a revenge game of sorts. The Buckeyes suffered an embarrassing defeat against the Iowa Hawkeyes. The Buckeyes ended the season 12‚Äì2 overall, winning the rest of their games including a Big Ten Championship victory over Wisconsin and a Cotton Bowl victory over USC. Urban Meyer was suspended for the first three games of the 2018 season for mishandling domestic violence allegations against then-wide receivers coach Zach Smith. Co-Offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Ryan Day served as interim coach and led the Buckeyes to a 3‚Äì0 start. Meyer returned to the sidelines and coached the team to four more victories before the team suffered a loss on October 20 to Purdue, 49‚Äì20. The Buckeyes won their last four games of the regular season, including a 62‚Äì39 win over archrival Michigan, in Columbus. The win gave the Buckeyes a share of the Big Ten East Division title, and the right to face Northwestern in the Big Ten Championship Game, which Ohio State won for its second consecutive Big Ten Championship. Ohio State would go on to win the Rose Bowl over Pac-12 Champion Washington 28‚Äì23, giving Ohio State their 8th Rose Bowl win. On December 4, 2018, the university announced that Meyer would retire after the 2019 Rose Bowl and be replaced by co-offensive coordinator Ryan Day.[54][55] In Day's first year, the Buckeyes went a perfect 13‚Äì0, including a win over archrival Michigan by a score of 56‚Äì27 and defeating Wisconsin for the Big Ten Championship. They would earn a spot in the College Football Playoff but would lose to Clemson 29‚Äì23 in the 2019 Fiesta Bowl. In Day's second year, the Big Ten season didn't start until late October due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Buckeyes would only play five out of a scheduled eight games due to several virus-related cancellations - including the Michigan game. Nevertheless, the Buckeyes would go 5‚Äì0 in the regular season, win the East Division title, and go on to beat Northwestern 22‚Äì10 in the Big Ten Championship Game, giving Day his second straight conference title. On January 1, 2021, the Buckeyes defeated Clemson 49‚Äì28 to win the Sugar Bowl in a rematch of the 2019 Fiesta Bowl to advance to the CFP National Championship Game against Alabama on January 11, which they lost 52‚Äì24. On September 11, 2021, he suffered his first regular season loss as head coach when the Oregon Ducks defeated the Buckeyes 35‚Äì28 in the 2nd game of the season. Ohio State's streak of defeating Michigan also came to an end on November 27, 2021, in Ann Arbor, when Ohio State lost 42‚Äì27.[56] They then won the 2022 Rose Bowl against Utah 48‚Äì45 on January 1, 2022. In 2022, Day led the team to an 11‚Äì0 record and was ranked #2 going into the Michigan game, which #3 Michigan would win 45‚Äì23 on November 26, 2022 (outscoring the Buckeyes 28‚Äì3 in the second half), in Ohio State's first loss to Michigan in Columbus since 2000, and first back‚Äìto‚Äìback losses to Michigan since 1999‚Äì2000. The Buckeyes would go on to play the defending national champion Georgia Bulldogs in the 2022 national semifinal game on New Year's Eve, taking a 14-point lead into the fourth quarter, but ultimately seeing their season come to an end with a 42‚Äì41 loss.[57] Kicker Noah Ruggles' would-be game-winning field goal attempt sailed wide left just as the clock struck midnight on New Year's Day, 2023. In 2023, Day led the team to an 11‚Äì0 record and was ranked #2 going into the Michigan game for the second consecutive year. This time, Michigan won by six points 30‚Äì24 on November 25, 2023. This marked the first three game losing streak to Michigan since 1995‚Äì97. The Buckeyes were then invited to the 2023 Cotton Bowl, where they lost to the Missouri Tigers 14‚Äì3 on December 29, 2023. Ohio State recognizes eight national championships from NCAA-designated \"consensus\" selectors,[58][59] including six (1942, 1954, 1957, 1968, 2002, 2014) from the major wire-service: AP Poll and/or Coaches' Poll.[59][60] The following is a list of Ohio State's claimed national championships: Ohio State has also been selected an additional seven times by various NCAA-designated \"major selectors\", in 1933, 1944, 1969, 1973, 1974, 1975, and 2006.[59][63][64] However, the Buckeyes do not recognize any of those championships. Ohio State joined the Big Ten in 1912; before that they were a member of the Ohio Athletic Conference (OAC) and won two OAC titles. Ohio State has won a championship in the Big Ten 39 times, second-most in the conference.[65] ‚Ä† Co-champions From 2011 to 2023, Big Ten had divisions to decide who would play for the conference championship. The divisions were known as Legends and Leaders from 2011 to 2013. In 2014, the divisions were realigned geographically into East and West. The divisional format ended for the 2024 season. ‚Ä† Co-champions Ohio State has played in 56 bowl games in which they are 28‚Äì29‚Äì0.[66] The Buckeyes have been to the Rose Bowl 16 times. Below are the team's most recent bowl games. ‚Ä† Vacated Ohio State University Marching Band[68] is the most visible and possibly best-known tradition of Ohio State football.[69] Home games are preceded by four marching band traditions:[70] The series versus Illinois began in 1902 and became the longest continuous series in 2002 when the schools played in their 89th consecutive year. In 2007, Ohio State was given their only defeat of the regular season by the Illini. Through the 2019 season, Ohio State leads the series 68‚Äì30‚Äì4.[71] Ohio State's first game with Michigan dates to 1897. Michigan leads the series 62‚Äì51‚Äì6 through the 2024 season.[72]This rivalry is considered to be Buckeyes' biggest rivalry. All the appearances of the letter M in Ohio Stadium are crossed out with red tape. Halftime shows during OSU games often feature something bad happening to the Michigan logo. When Penn State was added to the Big Ten conference football play in 1993, every member was given two designated rivals, teams to be played every year, with the other conference teams rotated out of the schedule at regular intervals. For geographic convenience, the Big Ten named Penn State as Ohio State's new designated rival in addition to Michigan. Ohio State leads the series 25‚Äì14 through the 2024 season.[73] The Buckeyes have had 24 head coaches in their 121-year history. Of the team's eight national championships to date, Woody Hayes won five, with Paul Brown, Jim Tressel, and Urban Meyer each having one. Roster Last update: August 22, 2024 [74] This table reflects the results of Big Ten match-ups when both OSU and its opponent were members of the conference through November 9, 2019.[75] Ohio State began Big Ten play in 1913. Examples of excluded results are Chicago after 1939, Michigan between 1907 and 1916, Michigan State before 1953, Penn State before 1993, and Nebraska before 2011 (see Big Ten History for further information). Ohio State's vacated wins from 2010 are not included (see 2010 Ohio State Buckeyes football team for further information). Through the 2006 season, Ohio State players have by a significant margin won more trophies than any other NCAA Division 1A program. Ohio State players have won 34 of the listed major awards, with the next closest being 26 (Oklahoma). Ohio State is the only university to have received each of the awards at least once. Of the five awards created prior to 1980 (Heisman, Lombardi, Maxwell, Outland, and Walter Camp), Ohio State has received the most with 25 (Notre Dame follows with 23). Although these numbers are cited as \"retired\" on Ohio State website,[76] they are considered enshrined rather than retired, and are available to be worn. All previously retired jersey numbers remain retired.[77] In 2020, the NCAA approved the use of the No. 0.[78] In order to further pay tribute to Bill Willis, Coach Day decided to start a new tradition and choose the player who will wear the number each season.[79] Note: Due to number restrictions, Thayer Munford could not wear number 0. Instead, he wore his regular number and honored the award with a patch. Two head coaches have also been honored by the Buckeyes, with banners at Ohio Stadium: Ohio State players have won the Heisman Trophy seven times, which ties Notre Dame and Oklahoma for the second most awards for any school, behind only USC with eight. Archie Griffin is the only two-time recipient in the history of the award.[80] Ohio State players have won the Lombardi Award six times: Four Ohio State players have won the Maxwell Award: Four Ohio State players have won the Outland Trophy: Ohio State players have won the Walter Camp Award four times: Ohio State Players have won the Fred Biletnikoff Award twice: Ohio State Players have won the Bronko Nagurski Trophy award twice: Ohio State players have won the Dick Butkus Award twice: Ohio State players have won the Jim Thorpe Award twice: Ohio State players have won the Dave Rimington Trophy four times: Ohio State players have won the Chicago Tribune Silver Football award 23 times: Ohio State players have won the Graham‚ÄìGeorge Offensive Player of the Year 13 times: Ohio State players have won the Nagurski‚ÄìWoodson Defensive Player of the Year 11 times: Through 2017, 199 Buckeyes have been named first team All-Americans since 1914. Of those 85 have been consensus picks. 388 have been named to the All-Big Ten team, and 16 have won the Chicago Tribune Silver Football, the Big Ten's Most Valuable Player award, including Troy Smith for 2006. The Athletic Directors of the Big Ten Conference voted Eddie George Big Ten-Jesse Owens Athlete of the Year for 1996. On November 22, 2006, ten Buckeyes were named to either the Coaches or Conference media All-Big Ten First Team selections for the 2006 season, and seven were named to both. Troy Smith was named Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year. Four other Buckeyes received Second Team honors.

WBNS/Columbus (1460 AM) and sister station WBNS-FM/Columbus (97.1 FM) serve as flagship stations, with more than 60 affiliates in Ohio, and two additional affiliates in West Virginia. Paul Keels is the play-by-play announcer, while former Buckeye left guard Jim Lachey serves as color analyst. They are joined by sideline reporter Matt Andrews and Skip Mosic, host of the network pregame and halftime shows.[82] WBNS-TV (channel 10) in Columbus is the long-standing \"official TV home\" of the Buckeyes, airing the official coach's show Game Time with Ryan Day (simulcast statewide on Bally Sports Ohio).[83] In addition, Ohio State football games are broadcast by their student radio organization, Scarlet and Gray Sports Radio on OhioStateSports.net Schedule announced October 5, 2023[84] (*) denotes protected matchup Announced schedules as of September 28, 2023.[85] In 2011, a study conducted by Nate Silver of the New York Times, which he described as \"not quite scientific,\" determined that Ohio State had the most fans of any college football team.[86]",

                "title": "Anderson Cooper - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Anderson Hays Cooper (born June 3, 1967)[1] is an American broadcast journalist and political commentator who anchors the CNN news broadcast show Anderson Cooper 360¬∞. In addition to his duties at CNN, Cooper serves as a correspondent for 60 Minutes, produced by CBS News. After graduating from Yale University with a Bachelor of Arts in 1989, he began traveling the world, shooting footage of war-torn regions for Channel One News. Cooper was hired by ABC News as a correspondent in 1995, but he soon took more jobs throughout the network, working for a short time as a co-anchor, reality game show host, and fill-in morning talk show host. In 2001, Cooper joined CNN, where he was given his own show, Anderson Cooper 360¬∞; he has remained the show's host since. He developed a reputation for his on-the-ground reporting of breaking news events, with his coverage of Hurricane Katrina causing his popularity to sharply increase. For his coverage of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Cooper received a National Order of Honour and Merit, the highest honor granted by the Haitian government. From September 2011 to May 2013, he also served as the host of his own syndicated television daytime talk show, Anderson Live. Cooper has won 18 Emmy Awards and two Peabody Awards, as well as an Edward Murrow Award from the Overseas Press Club in 2011. A member of the Vanderbilt family, he came out as gay in 2012, becoming \"the most prominent gay journalist on American television\".[2] In 2016, Cooper became the first LGBT person to moderate a presidential debate, and he has received several GLAAD Media Awards. Cooper was born in Manhattan, New York City, the younger son of writer Wyatt Emory Cooper and artist Gloria Vanderbilt. His maternal grandparents were millionaire equestrian Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt of the Vanderbilt family and socialite Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt, and Reginald's patrilineal great-grandfather was business magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt, who founded the prominent Vanderbilt shipping and railroad fortune.[3] He has two older half-brothers, Leopold Stanislaus \"Stan\" Stokowski (b. 1950) and Christopher Stokowski (b. 1952), from Gloria's ten-year marriage to conductor Leopold Stokowski.[4] In 2014, Cooper appeared in Henry Louis Gates Jr.'s Finding Your Roots, where he learned of an ancestor, Burwell Boykin, who was a slave owner from the southern United States.[5][6] Cooper's media experience began early. As a baby, he was photographed by Diane Arbus for Harper's Bazaar.[7][8] At the age of three, Cooper was a guest on The Tonight Show on September 17, 1970, appearing with his mother.[citation needed] At the age of nine, he appeared on To Tell the Truth as an impostor. From age 10 to 13, Cooper modeled with Ford Models for Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein and Macy's.[9] Wyatt experienced a series of heart attacks while undergoing open-heart surgery, and died January 5, 1978, at the age of 50. Cooper considers his father's book Families to be \"sort of a guide on... how he would have wanted me to live my life and the choices he would have wanted me to make. And so I feel very connected to him.\"[9] When Cooper was 21, his older brother, Carter Vanderbilt Cooper, committed suicide on July 22, 1988, at age 23, by jumping from the 14th-floor terrace of Vanderbilt's New York City penthouse apartment. Gloria Vanderbilt later wrote about her son's death in the book A Mother's Story, in which she expressed her belief that the suicide was caused by a psychotic episode induced by an allergy to the anti-asthma prescription drug salbutamol. Carter's suicide sparked Anderson's interest in journalism:[9] Loss is a theme that I think a lot about, and it's something in my work that I dwell on. I think when you experience any kind of loss, especially the kind I did, you have questions about survival: Why do some people thrive in situations that others can't tolerate? Would I be able to survive and get on in the world on my own? Cooper attended the Dalton School, a private co-educational day school on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. At age 17, after graduating from Dalton a semester early, Cooper traveled around Africa for several months on a \"survival trip\". He contracted malaria on the trip and was hospitalized in Kenya. Describing the experience, Cooper wrote \"Africa was a place to forget and be forgotten in.\"[9][10][11] Cooper attended Yale University, where he resided in Trumbull College and was a coxswain on the lightweight rowing team. He was inducted into the Manuscript Society and majored in political science, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1989.[12] During college, Cooper spent two summers as an intern at the Central Intelligence Agency while studying political science.[13] He pursued journalism with no formal journalistic education.[14][13] He is a self-proclaimed \"news junkie since [he] was in utero\".[15] After Cooper graduated from Yale, he tried to gain entry-level employment with ABC answering telephones, but was unsuccessful. Finding it hard to get his foot in the door of on-air reporting, Cooper decided to enlist the help of a friend in making a fake press pass. At the time, Cooper was working as a fact checker for the small news agency Channel One, which produces a youth-oriented news program that is broadcast to many junior high and high schools in the United States.[16] Cooper then entered Myanmar on his own with his forged press pass and met with students fighting the Burmese government.[15] After reporting from Myanmar, Cooper lived in Vietnam for a year to study the Vietnamese language at the University of Hanoi. Persuading Channel One to allow him to bring a Hi8 camera with him, Cooper began filming and assembling reports of Vietnamese life and culture that aired on Channel One. In 1992, he filmed stories from Somalia, Bosnia, and Rwanda.[citation needed] After having been on such assignments for a couple of years, Cooper realized in 1994 that he had slowly become desensitized to the violence he was witnessing around him; the horrors of the Rwandan genocide became trivial: \"I would see a dozen bodies and think, you know, it's a dozen, it's not so bad.\"[10] One particular incident, however, snapped him out of it:[10] On the side of the road [Cooper] came across five bodies that had been in the sun for several days. The skin of a woman's hand was peeling off like a glove. Revealing macabre fascination, Cooper whipped out his disposable camera and took a closeup photograph for his personal album. As he did, someone took a photo of him. Later that person showed Cooper the photo, saying, \"You need to take a look at what you were doing.\" \"And that's when I realized I've got to stop, [...] I've got to report on some state fairs or a beauty pageant or something, to just, like, remind myself of some perspective.\" In 1995, Cooper became a correspondent for ABC News, eventually rising to the position of co-anchor on its overnight World News Now program on September 21, 1999. In 2000, he switched career paths, taking a job as the host of ABC's reality show The Mole:[15] My last year at ABC, I was working overnights anchoring this newscast, then during the day at 20/20. So I was sleeping in two- or four-hour shifts, and I was really tired and wanted a change. I wanted to clear my head and get out of news a little bit, and I was interested in reality TV‚Äîand it was interesting. Cooper was also a fill-in co-host for Regis Philbin on Live with Regis and Kelly in 2007 when Philbin underwent triple-bypass heart surgery.[17] As of 2019, he still periodically serves as guest co-host on Live when one of the two hosts cannot go in to work.[citation needed] Cooper left The Mole after its second season to return to broadcast news. In 2001, he joined CNN, commenting, \"Two seasons was enough, and 9/11 happened, and I thought I needed to be getting back to news.\"[15] His first position at CNN was to anchor alongside Paula Zahn on American Morning. In 2002, he became CNN's weekend prime-time anchor. Since 2002, he has hosted CNN's New Year's Eve special from Times Square.[citation needed] On September 8, 2003, Cooper became the anchor of Anderson Cooper 360¬∞ on CNN. Describing his philosophy as an anchor, he has said:[15] I think the notion of traditional anchor is fading away, the all-knowing, all-seeing person who speaks from on high. I don't think the audience really buys that anymore. As a viewer, I know I don't buy it. I think you have to be yourself, and you have to be real and you have to admit what you don't know, and talk about what you do know, and talk about what you don't know as long as you say you don't know it. I tend to relate more to people on television who are just themselves, for good or for bad, than I do to someone who I believe is putting on some sort of persona. The anchorman on The Simpsons is a reasonable facsimile of some anchors who have that problem. In 2005, Cooper covered the tsunami damage in Sri Lanka; the Cedar Revolution in Beirut, Lebanon; the death of Pope John Paul II; and the royal wedding of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles. In August 2005, he covered the Niger famine from Maradi.[citation needed] In 2005, during CNN coverage of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, he confronted Sen. Mary Landrieu, Sen. Trent Lott, and the Reverend Jesse Jackson about their perception of the government response. As Cooper said later in an interview with New York magazine, \"Yeah, I would prefer not to be emotional and I would prefer not to get upset, but it's hard not to when you're surrounded by brave people who are suffering and in need.\"[9] A contributor to Broadcasting & Cable magazine wrote: \"In its aftermath, Hurricane Katrina served to usher in a new breed of emo-journalism, skyrocketing CNN's Anderson Cooper to superstardom as CNN's golden boy and a darling of the media circles because of his impassioned coverage of the storm.\"[18] In September 2005, the format of CNN's NewsNight was changed from 60 to 120 minutes to cover the unusually violent hurricane season. To help distribute some of the increased workload, Cooper was temporarily added as co-anchor to Aaron Brown. This arrangement was reported to have been made permanent the same month by the president of CNN's U.S. operations, Jonathan Klein, who has called Cooper \"the anchorperson of the future\".[19] Following the addition of Cooper, the ratings for NewsNight increased significantly; Klein remarked that \"[Cooper's] name has been on the tip of everyone's tongue.\"[20] To further capitalize on this, Klein announced a major programming shakeup on November 2, 2005. Cooper's 360¬∞ program would be expanded to two hours and shifted into the 10:00 pm ET slot formerly held by NewsNight, with the third hour of Wolf Blitzer's The Situation Room filling in Cooper's former 7:00 pm ET slot. With \"no options\" left for him to host shows, Aaron Brown left CNN, ostensibly having \"mutually agreed\" with Jonathan Klein on the matter.[21] In early 2007, Cooper signed a multi-year deal with CNN that would allow him to continue as a contributor to 60 Minutes, as well as doubling his salary from $2 million annually to a reported $4 million.[22] On April 16, 2023, CNN launched a new Sunday primetime series, The Whole Story with Anderson Cooper.[23] In 2007, he began hosting CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute, a show about extraordinary deeds by ordinary people.[citation needed] In October 2007, Cooper began hosting the documentary Planet in Peril with Sanjay Gupta and Jeff Corwin on CNN. In 2008, Cooper, Gupta, and Lisa Ling from National Geographic Explorer teamed up for a sequel, Planet in Peril: Battle Lines, which premiered in December 2008.[24][25] In September 2010, Warner Bros. and Telepictures (both corporate siblings of CNN) announced that Cooper had signed an agreement to host a nationally syndicated talk show. The journalist Brian Stelter (at the time employed by The New York Times, and now by CNN), reported on Twitter that the new Warner Bros. daytime talk show would be named Anderson (now titled Anderson Live).[26][non-primary source needed] The show premiered on September 12, 2011,[27] and as part of negotiations over the talk show deal, Cooper signed a new multi-year contract with CNN to continue as the host of Anderson Cooper 360¬∞.[28][29] On October 29, 2012, it was announced that Anderson Live would end at the conclusion of its second season. The show, slightly renamed after season one and revamped with a variety of co-hosts, failed to achieve the ratings distributor Warner Brothers hoped for. The final Anderson Live aired on May 30, 2013.[citation needed] Along with Martha Raddatz, Cooper moderated the second presidential election debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.[30] This made him the first LGBT person to moderate a presidential debate in the general election.[31] In 2017, Cooper's close friend, Andy Cohen, joined Cooper in succeeding Kathy Griffin as co-host of CNN's New Year's Eve coverage.[32][33] They again co-hosted CNN's New Year's Eve for 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022[34] and 2023.[35] Cooper has been a correspondent for the CBS News program 60 Minutes since 2007, while concurrently serving as a CNN anchor and correspondent.[citation needed] Andy Cohen and Cooper announced that they would be going on a national tour to perform their conversational stage show AC2 beginning in March 2015.[36][37] The tour opened in Boston, followed by Miami Beach, Chicago and Atlanta.[37] The idea for the show came about after Cooper interviewed Cohen about his then-latest book, The Andy Cohen Diaries, at an event at the 92nd Street Y in New York City.[38][39] Since then, the two-man show has continued to tour, reaching more than fifty cities as of October 2018.[40] Cooper was the narrator for the 2011 Broadway revival of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, directed by Rob Ashford and starring Daniel Radcliffe.[41] A freelance writer, Cooper has authored a variety of articles that have appeared in many other outlets, including Details magazine.[42] In May 2006, Cooper published a memoir for HarperCollins, Dispatches from the Edge, detailing his life and work in Sri Lanka, Africa, Iraq and Louisiana over the previous year. Some of the book's proceeds are donated to charity.[43] The book topped The New York Times Best Seller list on June 18, 2006.[44] In 2017, Cooper and his mother, Gloria Vanderbilt, co-authored The Rainbow Comes and Goes: A Mother and Son on Life, Love, and Loss. Compiled from a series of emails, the memoir recounts their shared past, and Vanderbilt's tumultuous childhood. Cooper said his goal in writing the book and correspondence was to leave \"nothing left unsaid\" between the pair.[45] It landed on multiple best-seller lists the year of its publication.[46] From April 19 to 30, 2021 Cooper served as a guest host on Jeopardy! following the death of Alex Trebek.[47] In 2022, Cooper launched a deeply personal podcast exploring grief and loss. On the show, he interviews other notable people on their experiences with grief. Guests have included TV host Stephen Colbert, musician Laurie Anderson and comedian Molly Shannon.[48] The inspiration for the podcast came from his own life. Reflecting on the loss of his father when he was 10, the loss of his brother to suicide at 21, and the more recent loss of his mother Gloria Vanderbilt, he said \"What has struck me is the degree to which I had not dealt with this stuff at all.\" He shared that he wanted to explore this universal human experience. \"I just felt like, 'Why am I so alone in this? This is something we all go through.' And this idea gave me great strength, that I'm on a road that has been traveled by everybody, in one form or another. Why every time somebody is going down this road should it feel like the first time?\"[49] Cooper won a 2023 Webby Award for Best Series for All There Is. His 5-word acceptance speech was \"All There Is, Is Love.\"[50] As of 2016, Cooper was not registered to any political party.[51] While promoting his book, Cooper told Oprah Winfrey he had dyslexia as a child.[52] Cooper played Dungeons & Dragons with his brother as a child. He later said that it gave him and his brother an escape from the grief of their father's death.[53] Cooper is gay; as of 2012, he was (according to The New York Times) \"the most prominent openly gay journalist on American television\".[54] For years, Cooper avoided discussing his private life in interviews. On July 2, 2012, however, he gave Andrew Sullivan permission to publish an email that stated, in part:[55] I've begun to consider whether the unintended outcomes of maintaining my privacy outweigh personal and professional principle. It's become clear to me that by remaining silent on certain aspects of my personal life for so long, I have given some the mistaken impression that I am trying to hide something‚Äîsomething that makes me uncomfortable, ashamed or even afraid. This is distressing because it is simply not true. ... The fact is, I'm gay, always have been, always will be, and I couldn't be any more happy, comfortable with myself, and proud. In 2014, Apple CEO Tim Cook sought Cooper's advice before making the decision to publicly come out as gay.[56] In 2014, Cooper and his long-term partner at the time, Benjamin Maisani, purchased Rye House, a historic estate in Connecticut.[57] In March 2018, Cooper confirmed that he and Maisani had split up.[58] Cooper was friends with Anthony Bourdain, celebrity chef and host of the CNN series Parts Unknown. After Bourdain died by suicide on June 8, 2018, Cooper paid tribute to him in a CNN special program, Remembering Anthony Bourdain.[59][60] Cooper also paid tribute to Bourdain on the Thanksgiving 2020 episode of Anderson Cooper Full Circle, saying that he was \"proud to call Anthony Bourdain a friend\", and adding: \"He is so, so missed by so many.\"[61][62] In 2021, Cooper and co-author Katherine Howe published Vanderbilt: The Rise and Fall of an American Dynasty, a history of the Vanderbilt family going back to his Vanderbilt ancestors who came to New Amsterdam in the 17th century.[63] On April 30, 2020, Cooper announced the birth of his son Wyatt Morgan Cooper by a surrogate on April 27. \"On Monday I became a father. I've never said that out loud and it astonishes me. I have a son,\" he said at the end of a CNN Town Hall on his show, Anderson Cooper 360¬∞. He also went on to make an announcement on Instagram, stating that \"Wyatt Morgan Cooper was born on Monday weighing 7 pounds 2 ounces.\"[64][65] Though Cooper and Benjamin Maisani are no longer romantically involved, the pair co-parent the child and Maisani was present in the delivery room for Wyatt's birth. Wyatt is named after Cooper's late father, Wyatt Cooper, and his middle name is derived from the Morgan side of his family, being the maiden name of his maternal grandmother Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt.[66] On February 10, 2022, Cooper announced at the beginning of his show on CNN that he had just become a father for a second time to a son named Sebastian Luke Maisani-Cooper. Maisani is in the process of adopting Cooper's son Wyatt, after which Wyatt's surname will become Maisani-Cooper.[67][may be outdated as of November 2024] Cooper helped lead CNN's Peabody Award-winning coverage of Hurricane Katrina, and the network's Alfred I. duPont‚ÄìColumbia University Award-winning coverage of the 2004 tsunami. He has won 18 Emmy Awards, including two for his coverage of the earthquake in Haiti, and an Edward R. Murrow Award.[68]",

            {
                "title": "Puerto Rico - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Puerto Rico[i] (Spanish for 'rich port'; abbreviated PR),[21] officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,[b][j] is a self-governing Caribbean archipelago and island organized as an unincorporated territory of the United States under the designation of commonwealth. Located about 1,000 miles (1,600 km) southeast of Miami, Florida, between the Dominican Republic in the Greater Antilles and the U.S. Virgin Islands in the Lesser Antilles, it consists of the eponymous main island and numerous smaller islands, including Vieques, Culebra, and Mona. With approximately 3.2 million residents, it is divided into 78 municipalities, of which the most populous is the capital municipality of San Juan, followed by those within the San Juan metropolitan area.[21] Spanish and English are the official languages of the government,[23] though Spanish predominates.[24][25] Puerto Rico was settled by a succession of Amerindian peoples beginning 2,000 to 4,000 years ago;[26] these included the Ortoiroid, Saladoid, and Ta√≠no. It was claimed by Spain following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1493 and subsequently colonized by Juan Ponce de Le√≥n in 1508.[21] Puerto Rico was contested by other European powers into the 18th century but remained a Spanish possession for the next 400 years. The decline of the indigenous population, followed by an influx of Spanish settlers, primarily from the Canary Islands and Andalusia, and African slaves vastly changed the cultural and demographic landscape of the archipelago. Within the Spanish Empire, Puerto Rico played a secondary but strategically significant role compared to larger and wealthier colonies like Peru and New Spain.[27][28] By the late 19th century, a distinct Puerto Rican identity began to emerge, centered around a fusion of European, African, and indigenous elements.[29][30] In 1898, following the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Puerto Rico was acquired by the United States.[21][31] Puerto Ricans have been U.S. citizens since 1917 and can move freely between the archipelago and the mainland.[32] However, residents of Puerto Rico are disenfranchised from federal elections[33] and generally do not pay federal income tax.[34][35][k] In common with four other territories, Puerto Rico sends a nonvoting representative to the U.S. Congress, called a Resident Commissioner, and participates in presidential primaries; as it is not a state, Puerto Rico does not have a vote in the U.S. Congress, which oversees it under the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 1950. Congress approved a territorial constitution in 1952, allowing residents of the archipelago to elect a governor in addition to a senate and house of representatives. The political status of Puerto Rico is an ongoing debate.[36][37] Beginning in the mid-20th century, the U.S. government, together with the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company, launched a series of economic projects to develop Puerto Rico into an industrial high-income economy. It is classified by the International Monetary Fund as a developed jurisdiction with an advanced, high-income economy;[38] it ranks 40th on the Human Development Index. The major sectors of Puerto Rico's economy are manufacturing, primarily pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, and electronics, followed by services, namely tourism and hospitality.[39] Puerto Rico is Spanish for \"rich port\".[21] Puerto Ricans often call the island Borinquen, a derivation of Borik√©n, its Indigenous Ta√≠no name, which is popularly said to mean \"Land of the Valiant Lord\".[40][41][42] The terms boricua, borinque√±o, and borincano are commonly used to identify someone of Puerto Rican heritage,[43][44] and derive from Borik√©n and Borinquen respectively.[45] The island is also popularly known in Spanish as La Isla del Encanto, meaning \"the island of enchantment\".[46] Columbus named the island San Juan Bautista, in honor of Saint John the Baptist, while the capital city was named Ciudad de Puerto Rico (\"Rich Port City\").[21] Eventually traders and other maritime visitors came to refer to the entire island as Puerto Rico, while San Juan became the name used for the main trading/shipping port and the capital city.[l] The island's name was changed to Porto Rico by the United States after the Treaty of Paris of 1898.[48] The anglicized name was used by the U.S. government and private enterprises (also Porto in Italian, French, and Portuguese). The name was changed back to Puerto Rico in 1931 by a joint resolution in Congress introduced by F√©lix C√≥rdova D√°vila.[49][m][54][55][56] The official name of the entity in Spanish is Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico (\"Free Associated State of Puerto Rico\"), while its official English name is Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.[21] The Spanish official name was suggested by its architect Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n and adopted by a constitutional assembly on July 25, 1952. Some authorities have called it a euphemism and have charged that the official name in English of \"Commonwealth\" constitutes a fig leaf, i.e., associated with the covering up of an act that is actually embarrassing or distasteful with something of innocuous appearance.[57] Puerto Rico remains a territory of the United States, exercising substantial internal self-government, but subordinated to the U.S. Constitution in areas such as foreign affairs or defense. For this reason, it is not considered to be a full-fledged associated state under either international or U.S. domestic law.[58][59] The history of Puerto Rico began with the settlement of the Ortoiroid people before 430 BC. At the time of Christopher Columbus's arrival in the New World in 1493, the dominant indigenous culture was that of the Ta√≠nos. The Ta√≠no people's numbers went dangerously low during the later half of the 16th century because of new infectious diseases carried by Europeans, exploitation by Spanish settlers, and warfare.[61] Located in the northeastern Caribbean, Puerto Rico formed a key part of the Spanish Empire from the early years of the exploration, conquest and colonization of the New World. The island was a major military post during many wars between Spain and other European powers for control of the region in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. In 1593, Portuguese soldiers, sent from Lisbon by order of Phillip II, composed the first garrison of the San Felipe del Morro fortress in Puerto Rico. Some brought their wives, while others married Puerto Rican women, and today there are many Puerto Rican families with Portuguese last names. The smallest of the Greater Antilles, Puerto Rico was a stepping-stone in the passage from Europe to Cuba, Mexico, Central America, and the northern territories of South America. Throughout most of the 19th century until the conclusion of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Puerto Rico and Cuba were the last two Spanish colonies in the New World; they served as Spain's final outposts in a strategy to regain control of the American continents. Realizing that it was in danger of losing its two remaining Caribbean territories, the Spanish Crown revived the Royal Decree of Graces of 1815. The decree was printed in Spanish, English and French in order to attract Europeans, with the hope that the independence movements would lose their popularity and strength with the arrival of new settlers. Free land was offered to those who wanted to populate the islands on the condition that they swear their loyalty to the Spanish Crown and allegiance to the Catholic Church.[62] In 1898, during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Puerto Rico was invaded and subsequently became a possession of the U.S. The first years of the 20th century were marked by the struggle to obtain greater democratic rights from the U.S.[citation needed] The Foraker Act of 1900 established a civil government, ending rule by American generals and the Department of War. A U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Ortega v. Lara, 202 U.S. 339, 342 (1906),[n] involving the Foraker Act and referring to the island as \"the acquired country\", soon affirmed that the U.S. Constitution applied within its territory and that any domestic Puerto Rican laws which did not conflict with it remained in force.[63] The Jones Act of 1917, which made Puerto Ricans U.S. citizens, paved the way for the drafting of Puerto Rico's Constitution and its approval by Congress and Puerto Rican voters in 1952.[citation needed] Puerto Rico is one of five territories with less representation in the Federal government, along with the Federal District. In 2009, the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization approved a draft resolution calling on the U.S. government to expedite a process that would allow the Puerto Rican people to exercise fully their inalienable right to self-determination and independence.[64] In November 2012, a two-question referendum took place, simultaneous with the general elections.[65][66] The first question, voted on in August, asked voters whether they wanted to maintain the current status under the territorial clause of the U.S. Constitution. 54% voted against the status quo, effectively approving the second question to be voted on in November. The second question posed three alternate status options: statehood, independence, or free association.[67] 61.16% voted for statehood, 33.34% for a sovereign free-associated state, and 5.49% for independence.[68][failed verification] In 2016, President Barack Obama signed into law H.R. 5278: PROMESA, establishing a Control Board over the Puerto Rican government. This board will have a significant degree of federal control involved in its establishment and operations. In particular, the authority to establish the control board derives from the federal government's constitutional power to \"make all needful rules and regulations\" regarding U.S. territories; The president would appoint all seven voting members of the board; and the board would have broad sovereign powers to effectively overrule decisions by Puerto Rico's legislature, governor, and other public authorities.[69] There would be another referendum in 2017 in Puerto Rico, in favor of statehood although it was boycotted by some political opponents of it. (see 2017 Puerto Rican status referendum) In 2017, Puerto Rico suffered back-to-back large hurricanes: the Category 5 Hurricane Irma (September 7, 2017) and the Category 4 Hurricane Maria (September 20, 2017).[70] The storms caused an extreme amount of damage to the island, causing the following effects: all power was knocked out, 95% cell service, 43% of waste water treatment plants, 40 thousand land slides, 97% of roads blocked, 28% of health facilities damaged, leading to over 90% of the population applying for assistance after the storms.[70] See also Effects of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico It is thought that a combination of the debt crisis and two major hurricanes in the late 2010s, caused further departures from the island. Overall the population has decreased by about half a million in the 21st century, with many seeking better opportunities on the mainland.[71] Puerto Rico held its statehood referendum during the 3 November 2020 general elections; the ballot asked one question: \"Should Puerto Rico be admitted immediately into the Union as a State?\" The results showed that 52 percent of Puerto Rico voters answered yes.[72] In the United States in the early 2020s, the Puerto Rico Status Act was being worked on by Congress, and H.R. 8393 passed the House in 2022‚Äîthough it has not passed the Senate; this bill would support PR making a binding referendum. The bill does not decide PR's fate, it simply prepares the United States to respond the outcome of referendum.[73] In the 5 November 2024 elections, there was three choices in a non-binding referendum which included Statehood, Independence, or Independence with Free Association on the ballot; Statehood won with 59%.[74] In addition, on November 5, 2024, Jennifer Gonzalez won the office of Governor of Puerto Rico in the 2024 general election, with nearly 40% of the vote, who is pro-statehood.[75] Puerto Rico consists of the main island of Puerto Rico and various smaller islands, including Vieques, Culebra, Mona, Desecheo, and Caja de Muertos. Of these five, only Culebra and Vieques are inhabited year-round. Mona, which has played a key role in maritime history, is uninhabited most of the year except for employees of the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources.[76] There are many other even smaller islets, like Monito, located near Mona,[77] and Isla de Cabras and La Isleta de San Juan, both located on the San Juan Bay. The latter is the only inhabited islet with communities like Old San Juan and Puerta de Tierra, which are connected to the main island by bridges.[78][79] The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has an area of 5,320 square miles (13,800 km2), of which 3,420 sq mi (8,900 km2) is land and 1,900 sq mi (4,900 km2) is water.[81] Puerto Rico is larger than Delaware and Rhode Island but smaller than Connecticut. The maximum length of the main island from east to west is 110 mi (180 km), and the maximum width from north to south is 40 mi (64 km).[82] Puerto Rico is the smallest of the Greater Antilles. It is 80% of the size of Jamaica,[83] just over 18% of the size of Hispaniola and 8% of the size of Cuba, the largest of the Greater Antilles.[84] The topography of the island is mostly mountainous with large flat areas in the northern and southern coasts. The main mountain range that crosses the island from east to west is called the Cordillera Central (also known as the Central Mountain Range in English). The highest elevation in Puerto Rico, Cerro de Punta 4,390 feet (1,340 m),[81] is located in this range. Another important peak is El Yunque, one of the highest in the Sierra de Luquillo at the El Yunque National Forest, with an elevation of 3,494 ft (1,065 m).[85] Puerto Rico has 17 lakes, all man-made, and more than 50 rivers, most of which originate in the Cordillera Central.[86] Rivers in the northern region of the island are typically longer and of higher water flow rates than those of the south, since the south receives less rain than the central and northern regions. Puerto Rico is composed of Cretaceous to Eocene volcanic and plutonic rocks, overlain by younger Oligocene and more recent carbonates and other sedimentary rocks.[87] Most of the caverns and karst topography on the island occurs in the northern region. The oldest rocks are approximately 190 million years old (Jurassic) and are located at Sierra Bermeja in the southwest part of the island. They may represent part of the oceanic crust and are believed to come from the Pacific Ocean realm. Puerto Rico lies at the boundary between the Caribbean and North American Plates and is being deformed by the tectonic stresses caused by their interaction. These stresses may cause earthquakes and tsunamis. These seismic events, along with landslides, represent some of the most dangerous geologic hazards in the island and in the northeastern Caribbean. The 1918 San Ferm√≠n earthquake occurred on 11 October, 1918 and had an estimated magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale.[88] It originated off the coast of Aguadilla, several kilometers off the northern coast, and was accompanied by a tsunami. It caused extensive property damage and widespread losses, damaging infrastructure, especially bridges. It resulted in an estimated 116 deaths and $4 million in property damage. The failure of the government to move rapidly to provide for the general welfare contributed to political activism by opponents and eventually to the rise of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. On 7 January 2020,[89] the country experienced its largest earthquake since 1918,[90] estimated at magnitude 6.4.[91] Economic losses were estimated to be more than $3.1 billion.[92] The Puerto Rico Trench, the largest and deepest trench in the Atlantic, is located about 71 mi (114 km) north of Puerto Rico at the boundary between the Caribbean and North American plates.[93] It is 170 mi (270 km) long.[94] At its deepest point, named the Milwaukee Deep, it is almost 27,600 ft (8,400 m) deep.[93] The Mona Canyon, located in the Mona Passage between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, is another prominent oceanic landform with steep walls measuring between 1.25 and 2.17 miles (2.01 and 3.49 km) in height from bottom to top.[95] The climate of Puerto Rico in the K√∂ppen climate classification is mostly tropical rainforest. Temperatures are warm to hot year round, averaging near 85 ¬∞F (29 ¬∞C) in lower elevations and 70 ¬∞F (21 ¬∞C) in the mountains. Easterly trade winds pass across the island year round. Puerto Rico has a rainy season, which stretches from April into November, and a dry season stretching from December to March. The mountains of the Cordillera Central create a rain shadow and are the main cause of the variations in the temperature and rainfall that occur over very short distances. The mountains can also cause wide variation in local wind speed and direction due to their sheltering and channeling effects, adding to the climatic variation. Daily temperature changes seasonally are quite small in the lowlands and coastal areas. Between the dry and wet seasons, there is a temperature change of around 6 ¬∞F (3.3 ¬∞C). This change is due mainly to the warm waters of the tropical Atlantic Ocean, which significantly modify cooler air moving in from the north and northwest. Coastal water temperatures during the year are about 75 ¬∞F (24 ¬∞C) in February and 85 ¬∞F (29 ¬∞C) in August. The highest temperature ever recorded was 110 ¬∞F (43 ¬∞C) at Arecibo,[96] while the lowest temperature ever recorded was 40 ¬∞F (4 ¬∞C) in the mountains at Adjuntas, Aibonito, and Corozal.[97] The average yearly precipitation is 66 in (1,676 mm).[98] Climate change in Puerto Rico has had a large impact on the ecosystems and landscapes.[99] Puerto Rico experiences the Atlantic hurricane season, similar to the rest of the Caribbean Sea and North Atlantic Ocean. On average, a quarter of its annual rainfall is contributed from tropical cyclones, which are more prevalent during periods of La Ni√±a than El Ni√±o.[100] A cyclone of tropical storm strength passes near Puerto Rico, on average, every five years. A hurricane passes in the vicinity of the island, on average, every seven years. Since 1851, the Lake Okeechobee Hurricane (also known as the San Felipe Segundo hurricane in Puerto Rico) of September 1928 is the only hurricane to make landfall as a Category 5 hurricane.[101] In 2017, Puerto Rico was affected by Category 5 Hurricane Irma and Category 4 Hurricane Maria,[102] causing widespread and devastating impacts, particularly to the electric grid.[102] Puerto Rico is home to three terrestrial ecoregions: Puerto Rican moist forests, Puerto Rican dry forests, and Greater Antilles mangroves.[103] Puerto Rico has two biosphere reserves recognized by the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme: Luquillo Biosphere Reserve represented by El Yunque National Forest and the Gu√°nica Biosphere Reserve. Species endemic to the archipelago number 239 plants, 16 birds and 39 amphibians/reptiles, recognized as of 1998. Most of these (234, 12 and 33 respectively) are found on the main island.[104] The most recognizable endemic species and a symbol of Puerto Rican pride is the coqu√≠, a small frog easily identified by the sound of its call, from which it gets its name. Most coqu√≠ species (13 of 17) live in the El Yunque National Forest,[105] the only tropical rainforest in the U.S. Forest Service system, located in the northeast of the island. It was previously known as the Caribbean National Forest. El Yunque is home to more than 240 plants, 26 of which are endemic to the island. It is also home to 50 bird species, including the critically endangered Puerto Rican amazon. In addition to El Yunque National Forest, the Puerto Rican moist forest ecoregion is represented by protected areas such as the Maricao and Toro Negro state forests. These areas are home to endangered endemic species such as the Puerto Rican boa (Chilabothrus inornatus), the Puerto Rican sharp-shinned hawk (Accipiter striatus venator), the Puerto Rican broad-winged hawk (Buteo platypterus brunnescens) and the elfin woods warbler (Setophaga angelae). The Northern Karst country of Puerto Rico is also home to one of the remaining rainforest tracts in the island, with the R√≠o Abajo State Forest being the first focus for the reintroduction of the highly endangered Puerto Rican parrot outside of the Sierra de Luquillo.[106][107] In the southwest, the Gu√°nica State Forest and Biosphere Reserve contain over 600 uncommon species of plants and animals, including 48 endangered species and 16 that are endemic to Puerto Rico, and is considered a prime example of the Puerto Rican dry forest ecoregion and the best-preserved dry forest in the Caribbean.[108] Other protected dry forests in Puerto Rico can be formed within the Caribbean Islands National Wildlife Refuge complex at the Cabo Rojo, Desecheo, Culebra and Vieques National Wildlife Refuges, and in the Caja de Muertos and Mona and Monito Islands Nature Reserves.[109] Examples of endemic species found in this ecoregion are the higo chumbo (Harrisia portoricensis), the Puerto Rican crested toad (Peltophryne lemur), and the Mona ground iguana (Cyclura stejnegeri), the largest land animal native to Puerto Rico.[110] Puerto Rico has three of the seven year-long bioluminescent bays in the Caribbean: Laguna Grande in Fajardo, La Parguera in Lajas and Puerto Mosquito in Vieques. These are unique bodies of water surrounded by mangroves that are inhabited by the dinoflagellate Pyrodinium bahamense.[111][112] However, tourism, pollution, and hurricanes have highly threatened these unique ecosystems.[113] Puerto Rico has a republican form of government based on the American model, with separation of powers subject to the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United States.[114][115] All governmental powers are delegated by the United States Congress, with the head of state being the president of the United States. As an unincorporated territory, Puerto Rico lacks full protection under the U.S. Constitution.[116] The government of Puerto Rico is composed of three branches. The executive is headed by the governor, currently Pedro Pierluisi Urrutia. The legislative branch consists of the bicameral Legislative Assembly, made up of a Senate as its upper chamber and a House of Representatives as its lower chamber; the Senate is headed by a president, currently Jos√© Luis Dalmau, while the House is headed by the speaker of the House, currently Tatito Hern√°ndez. The governor and legislators are elected by popular vote every four years, with the last election held in November 2020. The judicial branch is headed by the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, currently Maite Oronoz Rodr√≠guez. Members of the judiciary are appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the Senate. Puerto Rico is represented in the U.S. Congress by a nonvoting delegate to the House of Representatives, the resident commissioner, currently Jenniffer Gonz√°lez. Current congressional rules have removed the commissioner's power to vote in the Committee of the Whole, but the commissioner can vote in committee.[117] Puerto Rican elections are governed by the Federal Election Commission and the State Elections Commission of Puerto Rico.[118][119] Residents of Puerto Rico, including other U.S. citizens, cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections, but can vote in primaries. Puerto Ricans who become residents of a U.S. state or Washington, D.C. can vote in presidential elections. Puerto Rico has eight senatorial districts, 40 representative districts, and 78 municipalities; there are no first-order administrative divisions as defined by the U.S. government. Municipalities are subdivided into wards or barrios, and those into sectors. Each municipality has a mayor and a municipal legislature elected for a four-year term. The municipality of San Juan is the oldest, founded in 1521;[120] the next earliest settlements are San Germ√°n in 1570, Coamo in 1579, Arecibo in 1614, Aguada in 1692 and Ponce in 1692. Increased settlement in the 18th century saw 30 more communities established, following 34 in the 19th century. Six were founded in the 20th century, the most recent being Florida in 1971.[121] Since 1952, Puerto Rico has had three main political parties: the Popular Democratic Party (PPD in Spanish), the New Progressive Party (PNP in Spanish) and the Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP). The three parties stand for different political status. The PPD, for example, seeks to maintain the island's status with the U.S. as a commonwealth, while the PNP seeks to make Puerto Rico a U.S. state. Meanwhile, the PIP seeks to make Puerto Rico a sovereign nation free from U.S. authority. In terms of party strength, the PPD and PNP usually hold about 47% of the vote each while the PIP holds about 5%. After 2007, other parties emerged on the island. The first, the Puerto Ricans for Puerto Rico Party was registered that same year. The party claims that it seeks to address the islands' problems from a status-neutral platform. But it ceased to remain as a registered party when it failed to obtain the required number of votes in the 2008 general election. Four years later, the 2012 election saw the emergence of the Movimiento Uni√≥n Soberanista (English: Sovereign Union Movement) and the Partido del Pueblo Trabajador (English: Working People's Party) but none obtained more than 1% of the vote. Other non-registered parties include the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, the Socialist Workers Movement, and the Hostosian National Independence Movement. The nature of Puerto Rico's political relationship with the U.S. is the subject of ongoing debate in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Congress, and the United Nations.[122] Specifically, the basic question is whether Puerto Rico should remain an unincorporated territory of the U.S., become a U.S. state, or become an independent country.[123] Constitutionally, Puerto Rico is subject to the plenary powers of the U.S. Congress under the territorial clause of Article IV of the U.S. Constitution.[124] Laws enacted at the federal level in the U.S. apply to Puerto Rico as well, regardless of its political status. Their residents do not have voting representation in the U.S. Congress. Puerto Rico lacks \"the full sovereignty of an independent nation\", for example, the power to manage its \"external relations with other nations\", which is held by the U.S. federal government. The U.S. Supreme Court has indicated that once the U.S. Constitution has been extended to an area (by Congress or the courts), its coverage is irrevocable. To hold that the political branches may switch the Constitution on or off at will would lead to a regime in which they, not this Court, say \"what the law is\".[125] Puerto Ricans \"were collectively made U.S. citizens\" in 1917 as a result of the Jones‚ÄìShafroth Act.[126] U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections, though both major parties, Republican and Democratic, hold primary elections in Puerto Rico to choose delegates to vote on the parties' presidential candidates. Since Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory and not a U.S. state, the U.S. Constitution does not fully enfranchise U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico.[116][127] Only fundamental rights under the American federal constitution and adjudications are applied to Puerto Ricans. Various other U.S. Supreme Court decisions have held which rights apply in Puerto Rico and which ones do not. Puerto Ricans have a long history of service in the U.S. Armed Forces and, since 1917, they have been included in the U.S. compulsory draft when it has been in effect. Though the Commonwealth government has its own tax laws, residents of Puerto Rico, contrary to a popular misconception, do pay U.S. federal taxes: customs taxes (which are subsequently returned to the Puerto Rico Treasury), import/export taxes, federal commodity taxes, social security taxes, etc. Residents pay federal payroll taxes, such as Social Security and Medicare, as well as Commonwealth of Puerto Rico income taxes. All federal employees, those who do business with the federal government, Puerto Rico-based corporations that intend to send funds to the U.S., and some others, such as Puerto Rican residents that are members of the U.S. military, and Puerto Rico residents who earned income from sources outside Puerto Rico also pay federal income taxes. In addition, because the cutoff point for income taxation is lower than that of the U.S. IRS code, and because the per-capita income in Puerto Rico is much lower than the average per-capita income on the mainland, more Puerto Rico residents pay income taxes to the local taxation authority than if the IRS code were applied to the island. This occurs because \"the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico government has a wider set of responsibilities than do U.S. State and local governments.\"[128][129][130][131][132][133][134] In 2009, Puerto Rico paid $3.742 billion into the U.S. Treasury.[135] Residents of Puerto Rico pay into Social Security, and are thus eligible for Social Security benefits upon retirement. They are excluded from the Supplemental Security Income, and the island receives a smaller fraction of the Medicaid funding it would receive if it were a U.S. state.[136] Also, Medicare providers receive less-than-full state-like reimbursements for services rendered to beneficiaries in Puerto Rico, even though the latter paid fully into the system.[137] Puerto Rico's authority to enact a criminal code derives from Congress and not from local sovereignty as with the states. Thus, individuals committing a crime can only be tried in federal or territorial court, otherwise it would constitute double jeopardy and is constitutionally impermissible.[138] In 1992, President George H. W. Bush issued a memorandum to heads of executive departments and agencies establishing the current administrative relationship between the federal government and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. This memorandum directs all federal departments, agencies, and officials to treat Puerto Rico administratively as if it were a state, insofar as doing so would not disrupt federal programs or operations. Many federal executive branch agencies have significant presence in Puerto Rico, just as in any state, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Transportation Security Administration, Social Security Administration, and others. While Puerto Rico has its own Commonwealth judicial system similar to that of a U.S. state, there is also a U.S. federal district court in Puerto Rico, and Puerto Ricans have served as judges in that Court and in other federal courts on the U.S. mainland regardless of their residency status at the time of their appointment. Sonia Sotomayor, a New Yorker of Puerto Rican descent, serves as an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Puerto Ricans have also been frequently appointed to high-level federal positions, including serving as U.S. ambassadors to other nations. Unlike the vast majority of U.S. states, Puerto Rico has no first-order administrative divisions akin to counties, but has 78 municipalities or municipios as the secondary unit of administration; for U.S. Census purposes, the municipalities are considered county equivalents. Municipalities are subdivided into barrios, and those into sectors. Each municipality has a mayor and a municipal legislature elected for four-year terms, per the Autonomous Municipalities Act of 1991. Puerto Rico is subject to the Commerce and Territorial Clause of the U.S. Constitution and is thus restricted on how it can engage with other nations, sharing the opportunities and limitations that state governments have albeit not being one. As is the case with state governments, it has established several trade agreements with other nations, particularly with Latin American countries such as Colombia and Panam√°.[139][140] It has also established trade promotion offices in many foreign countries, all Spanish-speaking, and within the U.S. itself, which now include Spain, the Dominican Republic, Panama, Colombia, Washington, D.C., New York City and Florida, and has included in the past offices in Chile, Costa Rica, and Mexico. Such agreements require permission from the U.S. Department of State; most are simply allowed by existing laws or trade treaties between the U.S. and other nations which supersede trade agreements pursued by Puerto Rico and different U.S. states. Puerto Rico hosts consulates from 41 countries, mainly from the Americas and Europe, with most located in San Juan.[120] At the local level, Puerto Rico established by law that the international relations which states and territories are allowed to engage must be handled by the Department of State of Puerto Rico, an executive department, headed by the secretary of state of Puerto Rico, who also serves as the unincorporated territory's lieutenant governor. It is also charged to liaise with general consuls and honorary consuls based in Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, along with the Office of the Resident Commissioner, manages all its intergovernmental affairs before entities of or in the U.S. (including the federal government of the U.S., local and state governments of the U.S., and public or private entities in the U.S.).[citation needed] Both entities frequently assist the Department of State of Puerto Rico in engaging with Washington, D.C.-based ambassadors and federal agencies that handle Puerto Rico's foreign affairs, such as the U.S. Department of State, the Agency for International Development, and others. The current secretary of state is Larry Seilhamer Rodr√≠guez from the New Progressive Party, while the current director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration is Jennifer M. Stopiran also from the NPP and a member of the Republican Party of the U.S.[citation needed] The resident commissioner of Puerto Rico, the delegate elected by Puerto Ricans to represent them before the federal government, including the U.S. Congress, sits in the U.S. House of Representatives, serves and votes on congressional committees, and functions in every respect as a legislator except being denied a vote on the final disposition of legislation on the House floor. The current resident commissioner is Jenniffer Gonz√°lez-Col√≥n, a member of the New Progressive Party and the Republican Party, elected in 2016. She received more votes than any other official elected in Puerto Rico that year.[141] Many Puerto Ricans have served as U.S. ambassadors to different nations and international organizations, such as the Organization of American States, mostly but not exclusively in Latin America. For example, Maricarmen Aponte, a Puerto Rican and now an acting assistant secretary of state, previously served as U.S. ambassador to El Salvador.[142] As it is an unincorporated U.S. territory, the defense of Puerto Rico is provided by the U.S. as part of the Treaty of Paris with the president of the U.S. as its commander-in-chief. Puerto Rico has its own National Guard, and its own state defense force, the Puerto Rico State Guard, which by local law is under the authority of the Puerto Rico National Guard. The commander-in-chief of both local forces is the governor of Puerto Rico who delegates his authority to the Puerto Rico adjutant general, currently Major General Jos√© J. Reyes. The Adjutant General, in turn, delegates the authority over the State Guard to another officer but retains the authority over the Puerto Rico National Guard as a whole. U.S. military installations in Puerto Rico were part of the U.S. Atlantic Command (LANTCOM after 1993 USACOM), which had authority over all U.S. military operations that took place throughout the Atlantic. Puerto Rico had been seen as crucial in supporting LANTCOM's mission until 1999, when U.S. Atlantic Command was renamed and given a new mission as U.S. Joint Forces Command. Puerto Rico is currently under the responsibility of U.S. Northern Command. Both the Naval Forces Caribbean (NFC) and the Fleet Air Caribbean (FAIR) were formerly based at the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station. The NFC had authority over all U.S. Naval activity in the waters of the Caribbean while FAIR had authority over all U.S. military flights and air operations over the Caribbean. With the closing of the Roosevelt Roads and Vieques Island training facilities, the U.S. Navy has basically exited from Puerto Rico, except for the ships that steam by, and the only significant military presence in the island is the U.S. Army at Ft Buchanan, the Puerto Rican Army and Air National Guards, and the U.S. Coast Guard. Protests over the noise of bombing practice forced the closure of the naval base. This resulted in a loss of 6,000 jobs and an annual decrease in local income of $300 million.[143] A branch of the U.S. Army National Guard is stationed in Puerto Rico ‚Äì known as the Puerto Rico Army National Guard ‚Äì which performs missions equivalent to those of the Army National Guards of different U.S. states, including ground defense, disaster relief, and control of civil unrest. The local National Guard also incorporates a branch of the U.S. Air National Guard ‚Äì known as the Puerto Rico Air National Guard ‚Äì which performs missions equivalent to those of the Air National Guards of each one of the U.S. states. At different times in the 20th century, the U.S. had about 25 military or naval installations in Puerto Rico.[144] The largest of these installations were the former Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in Ceiba, the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility (AFWTF) on Vieques, the National Guard training facility at Camp Santiago in Salinas, Fort Allen in Juana Diaz, the Army's Fort Buchanan in San Juan, the former U.S. Air Force's Ramey Air Force Base in Aguadilla, and the Puerto Rico Air National Guard's Mu√±iz Air National Guard Base in San Juan.[145] The former U.S. Navy facilities at Roosevelt Roads, Vieques, and Sabana Seca have been deactivated and partially turned over to the local government. Other than U.S. Coast Guard and Puerto Rico National Guard facilities, there are only two remaining military installations in Puerto Rico: the U.S. Army's small Ft. Buchanan (supporting local veterans and reserve units) and the PRANG (Puerto Rico Air National Guard) Mu√±iz Air Base (the C-130 Fleet). In recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered their deactivations, but these have been opposed by diverse public and private entities in Puerto Rico ‚Äì such as retired military who rely on Ft. Buchanan for the services available there. Puerto Ricans have participated in many U.S. military conflicts, including the American Revolution, when volunteers from Puerto Rico, Cuba, and Mexico fought the British in 1779 under the command of General Bernardo de G√°lvez (1746‚Äì1786).[146] They continue to be disproportionately represented in present-day conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.[147] The most notable example is the 65th Infantry Regiment of the U.S. Army, nicknamed The Borinqueneers, from the original Ta√≠no name of the island (Borinquen). The all-Puerto Rican regiment participated in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the War on Terror; in 2014, it was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for its heroism during the Korean War. A significant number of Puerto Ricans serve in the U.S. Armed Forces, largely as National Guard members and civilian employees. The size of the overall military-related community is estimated to be 100,000, including retired personnel.[145] Fort Buchanan has about 4,000 military and civilian personnel. In addition, approximately 17,000 people are members of the Puerto Rico Army and Air National Guards, or the U.S. Reserve forces.[148] The insular legal system is a blend of civil law and the common law systems. Puerto Rico is the only current U.S. jurisdiction whose legal system operates primarily in a language other than American English: namely, Spanish. Because the U.S. federal government operates primarily in English, all Puerto Rican attorneys must be bilingual in order to litigate in English in U.S. federal courts, and litigate federal preemption issues in Puerto Rican courts.[149][original research?] Title 48 of the United States Code outlines the role of the U.S. Code to U.S. territories and insular areas such as Puerto Rico. After the U.S. government assumed control of Puerto Rico in 1901, it initiated legal reforms resulting in the adoption of codes of criminal law, criminal procedure, and civil procedure modeled after those then in effect in California. Although Puerto Rico has since followed the federal example of transferring criminal and civil procedure from statutory law to rules promulgated by the judiciary, several portions of its criminal law still reflect the influence of the California Penal Code. The judicial branch is headed by the chief justice of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, which is the only appellate court required by the Constitution. All other courts are created by the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico.[150] There is also a Federal District Court for Puerto Rico, and someone accused of a criminal act at the federal level may not be accused for the same act in a Commonwealth court, and vice versa, since Puerto Rico as an unincorporated territory lacks sovereignty separate from Congress as a state does.[138] The U.S. Supreme Court held in 2016 that such a parallel accusation would constitute double jeopardy.[151] The homicide rate of 19.2 per 100,000 inhabitants was significantly higher than any U.S. state in 2014.[152][153] Most homicide victims are gang members and drug traffickers with about 80% of homicides in Puerto Rico being drug related.[154] In 1992, the FBI made armed carjacking a federal crime and rates decreased per statistics,[155] but as of 2019, the problem continued in municipalities like Guaynabo and others.[156][157][158][159][160] From 1 January 2019 to 14 March 2019, thirty carjackings had occurred on the island.[161] Puerto Rico is classified as a high income economy by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.[38] It is considered the most competitive economy in Latin America by the World Economic Forum and ranks highly on the Human Development Index. According to World Bank, gross national income per capita in Puerto Rico in 2020 was $21,740.[162] Puerto Rico's economy is mainly driven by manufacturing (primarily pharmaceuticals, textiles, petrochemicals and electronics) followed by services (primarily finance, insurance, real estate and tourism); agriculture represents less than 1% of GNP.[163][o][p] In recent years, it has also become a popular destination for MICE (meetings, incentives, conferencing, exhibitions), with a modern convention center district overlooking the Port of San Juan.[164] Responsibility for San Juan port inspections lies with PPQ.[165] So high is the volume of cargo traffic that between 1984‚Äì2000 the San Juan PPQ station recorded 7.74% of all interceptions, #4 in the country, #2 for insects and #3 for pathogens.[165] Most species are originally from South America or elsewhere in the Caribbean due to PR's position as an intermediary on the way to the mainland.[165] This is one of the worst locations for cut flowers and other plant parts ‚Äì both in terms of number of problems and diversity of species ‚Äì for insects in plant parts in baggage, and for pathogens in plant parts in baggage and cargo.[165] Pathogen interceptions were dramatically (17%) higher 1999‚Äì2000 than in 1985‚Äì1986.[165] Puerto Rico's geography and political status are both determining factors for its economic prosperity, primarily due to its relatively small size; lack of natural resources and subsequent dependence on imports; and vulnerability to U.S. foreign policy and trading restrictions, particularly concerning its shipping industry. Puerto Rico experienced a recession from 2006 to 2011, interrupted by four quarters of economic growth, and entered into recession again in 2013, following growing fiscal imbalance and the expiration of the IRS Section 936 corporate incentives that the U.S. Internal Revenue Code had applied to Puerto Rico. This IRS section was critical to the economy, as it established tax exemptions for U.S. corporations that settled in Puerto Rico and allowed their insular subsidiaries to send their earnings to the parent corporation at any time, without paying federal tax on corporate income. Puerto Rico has been able to maintain a relatively low inflation in the past decade while maintaining a purchasing power parity per capita higher than 80% of the rest of the world.[166] Academically, most of Puerto Rico's economic woes stem from federal regulations that expired, have been repealed, or no longer apply to Puerto Rico; its inability to become self-sufficient and self-sustainable throughout history;[q] its highly politicized public policy which tends to change whenever a political party gains power;[r] as well as its highly inefficient local government[s][t] which has accrued a public debt equal to 68% of its gross domestic product throughout time.[u][v] Puerto Rico currently has a public debt of $72.204 billion (equivalent to 103% of GNP), and a government deficit of $2.5 billion.[172][173] By American standards, Puerto Rico is underdeveloped: It is poorer than Mississippi, the poorest state of the U.S., with 41% of its population below the poverty line.[w] However, it has the highest GDP per capita in Latin America. Puerto Rico's main trading partners are the United States, Ireland, and Japan, with most products coming from East Asia, mainly China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Puerto Rico's dependency on oil for transportation and electricity generation, as well as its dependency on food imports and raw materials, makes Puerto Rico volatile and highly reactive to changes in the world economy and climate. Tourism in Puerto Rico is also an important part of the economy. In 2017, Hurricane Maria caused severe damage to the island and its infrastructure, disrupting tourism for many months. The damage was estimated at $100 billion. An April 2019 report indicated that by that time, only a few hotels were still closed, that life for tourists in and around the capital had, for the most part, returned to normal.[175] By October 2019, nearly all of the popular amenities for tourists, in the major destinations such as San Juan, Ponce and Arecibo, were in operation on the island and tourism was rebounding. This was important for the economy, since tourism provides up to 10% of Puerto Rico's GDP, according to Discover Puerto Rico.[176] A tourism campaign was launched by Discover Puerto Rico in 2018 intended to highlight the island's culture and history, branding it distinct, and different from other Caribbean destinations. In 2019, Discover Puerto Rico planned to continue that campaign.[177] In early 2017, the Puerto Rican government-debt crisis posed serious problems for the government which was saddled with outstanding bond debt that had climbed to $70 billion.[178] The debt had been increasing during a decade-long recession.[179] The Commonwealth had been defaulting on many debts, including bonds, since 2015. With debt payments due, the governor was facing the risk of a government shutdown and failure to fund the managed health care system.[180][181] \"Without action before April, Puerto Rico's ability to execute contracts for Fiscal Year 2018 with its managed care organizations will be threatened, thereby putting at risk beginning July 1, 2017 the health care of up to 900,000 poor U.S. citizens living in Puerto Rico\", according to a letter sent to Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. They also said that \"Congress must enact measures recommended by both Republicans and Democrats that fix Puerto Rico's inequitable health care financing structure and promote sustained economic growth.\"[181] Initially, the oversight board created under PROMESA called for Puerto Rico's governor Ricardo Rossell√≥ to deliver a fiscal turnaround plan by 28 January. Just before that deadline, the control board gave the Commonwealth government until 28 February to present a fiscal plan (including negotiations with creditors for restructuring debt) to solve the problems. A moratorium on lawsuits by debtors was extended to 31 May.[179] It is essential for Puerto Rico to reach restructuring deals to avoid a bankruptcy-like process under PROMESA.[182] An internal survey conducted by the Puerto Rican Economists Association revealed that the majority of Puerto Rican economists reject the policy recommendations of the Board and the Rossell√≥ government, with more than 80% of economists arguing in favor of auditing the debt.[183] In early August 2017, the island's financial oversight board (created by PROMESA) planned to institute two days off without pay per month for government employees, down from the original plan of four days per month; the latter had been expected to achieve $218 million in savings. Governor Rossello rejected this plan as unjustified and unnecessary. Pension reforms were also discussed including a proposal for a 10% reduction in benefits to begin addressing the $50 billion in unfunded pension liabilities.[184] Puerto Rico has an operating budget of about U.S.$9.8 billion with expenses at about $10.4 billion, creating a structural deficit of $775 million (about 7.9% of the budget).[185] The practice of approving budgets with a structural deficit has been done for 24 consecutive years starting in 2000. Throughout those years, including present time, all budgets contemplated issuing bonds to cover these projected deficits rather than making structural adjustments. This practice increased Puerto Rico's cumulative debt, as the government had already been issuing bonds to balance its actual budget for four decades beginning in 1973.[x][187] Projected deficits added substantial burdens to an already indebted nation which accrued a public debt of $71B or about 70% of Puerto Rico's gross domestic product. This sparked an ongoing government-debt crisis after Puerto Rico's general obligation bonds were downgraded to speculative non-investment grade (\"junk status\") by three credit-rating agencies. In terms of financial control, almost 9.6%‚Äîor about $1.5 billion‚Äîof Puerto Rico's central government budget expenses for FY2014 is expected to be spent on debt service.[y] Harsher budget cuts are expected as Puerto Rico must now repay larger chunks of debts in the coming years.[needs update] For practical reasons the budget is divided into two aspects: a \"general budget\" which comprises the assignments funded exclusively by the Department of Treasury of Puerto Rico, and the \"consolidated budget\" which comprises the assignments funded by the general budget, by Puerto Rico's government-owned corporations, by revenue expected from loans, by the sale of government bonds, by subsidies extended by the federal government of the United States, and by other funds. Both budgets contrast each other drastically, with the consolidated budget being usually thrice the size of the general budget; currently $29B and $9.0B respectively. Almost one out of every four dollars in the consolidated budget comes from U.S. federal subsidies while government-owned corporations compose more than 31% of the consolidated budget. The critical aspects come from the sale of bonds, which comprise 7% of the consolidated budget ‚Äì a ratio that increased annually due to the government's inability to prepare a balanced budget in addition to being incapable of generating enough income to cover all its expenses. In particular, the government-owned corporations add a heavy burden to the overall budget and public debt, as none is self-sufficient. For example, in FY2011 the government-owned corporations reported aggregated losses of more than $1.3B with the Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority (PRHTA) reporting losses of $409M, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA; the government monopoly that controls all electricity on the island) reporting losses of $272M, while the Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewers Authority (PRASA; the government monopoly that controls all water utilities on the island) reported losses of $112M.[189] Losses by government-owned corporations have been defrayed through the issuance of bonds compounding more than 40% of Puerto Rico's entire public debt today.[190] Holistically, from FY2000‚ÄìFY2010 Puerto Rico's debt grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9% while GDP remained stagnant.[191] This has not always provided a long-term solution. In early July 2017 for example, the PREPA power authority was effectively bankrupt after defaulting in a plan to restructure $9 billion in bond debt; the agency planned to seek Court protection.[192] The cost of living in Puerto Rico is high and has increased over the past decade.[z][194][195][196][197][198][199][200] Statistics used for cost of living sometimes do not take into account certain costs, such as the high cost of electricity, which has hovered in the 24¬¢ to 30¬¢ range per kilowatt-hour, two to three times the national average, increased travel costs for longer flights, additional shipping fees, and the loss of promotional participation opportunities for customers \"outside the continental United States\". While some online stores do offer free shipping on orders to Puerto Rico, many merchants exclude Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories. The household median income is stated as $19,350 and the mean income as $30,463 in the U.S. Census Bureau's 2015 update. The report also indicates that 45.5% of individuals are below the poverty level.[201] The median home value in Puerto Rico ranges from U.S.$100,000 to U.S.$214,000, while the national median home value sits at $119,600.[aa] One of the most cited contributors to the high cost of living in Puerto Rico is the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, also known as the Jones Act, which prevents foreign-flagged ships from carrying cargo between two American ports, a practice known as cabotage.[203] Because of the Jones Act, foreign ships inbound with goods from Central and South America, Western Europe, and Africa cannot stop in Puerto Rico, offload Puerto Rico-bound goods, load mainland-bound Puerto Rico-manufactured goods, and continue to U.S. ports. Instead, they must proceed directly to U.S. ports, where distributors break bulk and send Puerto Rico-bound manufactured goods to Puerto Rico across the ocean by U.S.-flagged ships.[203] The local government of Puerto Rico has requested several times to the U.S. Congress to exclude Puerto Rico from the Jones Act restrictions without success.[ab] In 2013 the Government Accountability Office published a report which concluded that \"repealing or amending the Jones Act cabotage law might cut Puerto Rico shipping costs\" and that \"shippers believed that opening the trade to non-U.S.-flag competition could lower costs\".[ac][ad] Ultimately, the report concluded that \"[the] effects of modifying the application of the Jones Act for Puerto Rico are highly uncertain\" for both Puerto Rico and the U.S., particularly for the U.S. shipping industry and the military preparedness of the U.S.[205][206] A 2018 study by economists at Boston-based Reeve & Associates and Puerto Rico-based Estudios Tecnicos has concluded that the 1920 Jones Act has no impact on either retail prices or the cost of living on Puerto Rico.[207] Cities and towns in Puerto Rico are interconnected by a system of roads, freeways, expressways, and highways maintained by the Highways and Transportation Authority under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Transportation, and patrolled by the Puerto Rico Police Department. The island's San Juan metropolitan area is served by a public bus transit system and a metro system called Tren Urbano ('Urban Train'). Other forms of Puerto Rican public transport include seaborne ferries that serve Puerto Rico's archipelago as well as carros p√∫blicos (private mini buses). Puerto Rico has three international airports, the Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n International Airport in Carolina, Mercedita International Airport in Ponce, and the Rafael Hern√°ndez International Airport in Aguadilla, and 27 local airports. The Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n International Airport is the largest aerial transportation hub in the Caribbean.[208] Puerto Rico has nine ports in different cities across the main island. The San Juan Port is the largest in Puerto Rico, and the busiest port in the Caribbean and the 10th busiest in the United States in terms of commercial activity and cargo movement, respectively.[208] The second largest port is the Port of the Americas in Ponce, currently under expansion to increase cargo capacity to 1.5 million twenty-foot containers (TEUs) per year.[209] The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA, Spanish: Autoridad de Energ√≠a El√©ctrica, AEE)‚Äîis an electric power company and the government-owned corporation of Puerto Rico responsible for electricity generation, power transmission, and power distribution in Puerto Rico.[210] PREPA was, by law, the only entity authorized to conduct such business in Puerto Rico, effectively making it a government monopoly until 2018. The Authority is ruled by a governing board appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the Senate of Puerto Rico, and is run by an executive director. On 20 July 2018, Puerto Rico Law 120-2018 (Ley para Transformar el Sistema El√©ctrico de Puerto Rico) was signed. This law authorized PREPA to sell infrastructure and services to other providers. As a result, a contract was signed on 22 June 2020, making LUMA Energy the new operator of the energy distribution and transmission infrastructure, as well as other areas of PREPA's operations, in effect partially privatizing the Puerto Rican power grid. The takeover was set for 1 June 2021, amidst protests and uncertainty from the point of view of the general public and the former-PREPA workers and union members.[211][212] Similarly, the Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewers Authority (PRASA, Spanish: Autoridad de Acueductos y Alcantarillados, AAA)‚Äîis a water company and the government-owned corporation responsible for water quality, management, and supply in Puerto Rico.[213] It is the only entity authorized to conduct such business in Puerto Rico, effectively making it a government monopoly. Its existence is designated by Law No. 40 of 1 May 1945, including the corresponding amendments.[214] Telecommunications in Puerto Rico includes radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet. Broadcasting in Puerto Rico is regulated by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC).[215] As of 2007[update], there were 30 TV stations, 125 radio stations and roughly 1 million TV sets on the island. Cable TV subscription services are available, and the U.S. Armed Forces Radio and Television Service also broadcast on the island.[216] Puerto Rico also has its own amateur radio prefixes, which differ from those of the contiguous United States in that there are two letter before the number. The most well-known prefix is KP4, but others separated for use on the archipelago (including Desecheo and Mona) are: KP3/KP4/NP3/NP4/WP3/WP4 (Puerto Rico, Vieques and Culebra) and KP5/NP5/WP5 (Desecheo Island).[217] Amateur radio operators (also known as ham radio operators) are a well-known group in the island and can obtain special vehicle license plates with their callsign on them.[218] They have been a key element in disaster relief.[219] The population of Puerto Rico reflects influences from initial Amerindian settlement, European colonization, slavery, economic migration, and the archipelago's status as unincorporated territory of the United States. Puerto Ricans are characterized by a high degree of ethnic and cultural diversity, as well as a long history of intermarriage and acculturation among different demographics; racial and ethnic identity is subsequently complex and often nebulous, shaped by the broader attitudes and policies of the Spanish colonial period, 20th century American racial politics, and modern trends in cultural and identity in the 21st century United States.[221] According to the most recent 2020 United States Census, Puerto Rico had 3,285,874 residents, an 11.8% decrease since 2010.[16] The commonwealth's population peaked in 2000, when it was 3,808,610, before declining (for the first time in census history) to 3,725,789 in 2010.[222] Emigration due to economic difficulties and natural disasters, coupled with a low birth rate, have resulted in continued population decline into the 21st century.[223] The most populous municipality is the capital, San Juan, with 342,259 people based on the 2020 Census.[224] Other major cities include Bayam√≥n, Carolina, Ponce, and Caguas. Of the ten most populous cities on the island, eight are located within what is considered San Juan's metropolitan area, while the other two are located in the south (Ponce) and west (Mayag√ºez) of the island. As of 2020, Hispanic or Latinos made up 98.9 percent of the population, of which 95.5 percent were Puerto Rican and 3.4% were Hispanic of non-Puerto Rican origins; only 1.1 percent of the population was non-Hispanic.[226] Fewer than one-fifth of people (17.1 percent) identified as \"White\", a decline of almost 80 percent; by contrast, nearly half of Puerto Ricans (49.8 percent) reported being multiracial‚Äîcompared to just 3 percent in 2010‚Äîwhile roughly one-quarter chose \"some other race alone\" (25.5 percent).[221] Censuses of Puerto Rico were completed by Spain in 1765, 1775, 1800, 1815, 1832, 1846 and 1857, yet some of the data remained untabulated and were considered reliable in a 1943 report by Irene Barnes Taeuber, an American demographer at the Office of Population Research at Princeton University.[227] Continuous European immigration and high natural increase helped the population of Puerto Rico grow from 155,426 in 1800 to almost a million by the end of the 19th century. A census conducted by royal decree on 30 September 1858 gave the following totals of the Puerto Rican population at that time: 341,015 were free colored; 300,430 were white; and 41,736 were slaves.[228] A census in 1887 found a population of around 800,000, of which 320,000 were black.[229] During the 19th century, hundreds of families arrived in Puerto Rico, primarily from the Canary Islands and Andalusia, but also from other parts of Spain such as Catalonia, Asturias, Galicia and the Balearic Islands; they were later joined by numerous Spanish loyalists from Spain's former colonies in South America. There were also smaller numbers of settlers from outside Spain, including from Corsica, France, Lebanon, Portugal, Ireland, Scotland, Germany and Italy; this immigration from non-Hispanic countries was largely the result of the Real C√©dula de Gracias de 1815 (Royal Decree of Graces of 1815), which provided European Catholics with land allotments in the sparsely inhabited interior of the island, provided they paid taxes and continued to support the Catholic Church. Between 1960 and 1990, the census questionnaire in Puerto Rico did not ask about race or ethnicity. The 2000 United States Census included a racial self-identification question in Puerto Rico, according to which most Puerto Ricans identified as white and Latino and few identified as black or some other race. Although less than one percent of the population identifies as indigenous, a large proportion of Puerto Ricans have native ancestry: A 2003 study by the University of Puerto Rico,[230] which took genetic samples from 800 randomly selected subjects throughout the island, found that 61.1 percent of those surveyed had mitochondrial DNA of indigenous origin; additionally, 26.4 percent had African markers and 12.5 percent showed European descent.[231] The study reportedly resulted in a resurgence of indigenous and Taino identity among Puerto Ricans; in the 2010 census, 19,839 respondents identified as \"American Indian or Alaskan Native\", an increase of almost 49 percent from 2000 count.[231] The vast majority of recent immigrants, both legal and illegal, come from Latin America, over half come from the Dominican Republic. Dominicans represent 53% of non-Puerto Rican Hispanics, about 1.8% of Puerto Rico's population.[193] Some illegal immigrants, particularly from Haiti, Dominican Republic,[232][233] and Cuba[citation needed], use Puerto Rico as a temporary stop-over point to get to the U.S. mainland. Other major sources of recent immigrants include Cuba, Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela, Haiti, Honduras, Panama, Ecuador, Spain, and Jamaica.[234][235] Additionally, there are many non-Puerto Rican U.S. citizens settling in Puerto Rico from the U.S. mainland, majority of which are White Americans and a smaller number are Black Americans. In fact, non-hispanic people represent 1.1% and majority of them are from the U.S. mainland. Smaller numbers of U.S. citizens come from the U.S. Virgin Islands. There are also large numbers of Nuyoricans and other stateside Puerto Ricans coming back, as many Puerto Ricans engage in 'circular migration'.[236] Small numbers of non-Puerto Rican Hispanics in Puerto Rico are actually American-born migrants from the mainland U.S. and not recent immigrants. Most recent immigrants settle in and around the San Juan metropolitan area. Emigration is a major part of contemporary Puerto Rican history. Starting soon after World War II, poverty, cheap airfares, and promotion by the island government caused waves of Puerto Ricans to move to the U.S. mainland, particularly to the northeastern states and nearby Florida.[237] This trend continued even as Puerto Rico's economy improved and its birth rate declined. Puerto Ricans continue to follow a pattern of \"circular migration\", with some migrants returning to the island. In recent years, the population has declined markedly, falling nearly 1% in 2012 and an additional 1% (36,000 people) in 2013 due to a falling birthrate and emigration.[238] The impact of hurricanes Maria and Irma in 2017, combined with the unincorporated territory's worsening economy, led to its greatest population decline since the U.S. acquired the archipelago. According to the 2020 U.S. census, the number of Puerto Ricans living outside of Puerto Rico in the U.S. is almost twice as many as those living in Puerto Rico.[239] As those who leave tend to be better educated than those who remain, this accentuates the drain on Puerto Rico's economy. Based on 1 July 2019 estimate by the U.S. Census Bureau, the population of the Commonwealth had declined by 532,095 people since the 2010 Census data had been tabulated.[240] The official languages[241] of the executive branch of government of Puerto Rico[242] are Spanish and English, with Spanish being the primary language. Spanish is, and has been, the only official language of the entire Commonwealth judiciary system, despite a 1902 English-only language law.[243] However, all official business of the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico is conducted in English. English is the primary language of less than 10% of the population. Spanish is the dominant language of business, education and daily life on the island, spoken by nearly 95% of the population.[244] Out of people aged five and older, 94.3% speak only Spanish at home, 5.5% speak English, and 0.2% speak other languages.[2] A Pew Research survey indicated an adult literacy rate of 90.4% in 2012 based on data from the United Nations.[245] In Puerto Rico, public school instruction is conducted almost entirely in Spanish. There have been pilot programs in about a dozen of the over 1,400 public schools aimed at conducting instruction in English only. Objections from teaching staff are common, perhaps because many of them are not fully fluent in English.[246] English is taught as a second language and is a compulsory subject from elementary levels to high school. The languages of the deaf community are American Sign Language and its local variant, Puerto Rican Sign Language. The Spanish of Puerto Rico has evolved into having many idiosyncrasies in vocabulary and syntax that differentiate it from the Spanish spoken elsewhere. Puerto Rican Spanish utilizes many Ta√≠no words, as well as English words. The largest influence on the Spanish spoken in Puerto Rico is that of the Canary Islands. Ta√≠no loanwords are most often used in the context of vegetation, natural phenomena, and native musical instruments. Similarly, words attributed to primarily West African languages were adopted in the contexts of foods, music, and dances, particularly in coastal towns with concentrations of descendants of Sub-Saharan Africans.[247] Religious affiliation in Puerto Rico (2014)[248][249] Christianity is the dominant religion in Puerto Rico. Catholicism was brought by Spanish colonists and gradually became the prevailing faith. The first dioceses in the Americas, including that of Puerto Rico, were authorized by Pope Julius II in 1511.[250] In 1512, priests were established for the parochial churches. By 1759, there was a priest for each church.[251] One Pope, John Paul II, visited Puerto Rico in October 1984. All municipalities in Puerto Rico have at least one Catholic church, most of which are located at the town center, or plaza. Protestantism, which was suppressed under the Spanish Catholic regime, reemerged under U.S. rule, making contemporary Puerto Rico more interconfessional than in previous centuries, although Catholicism continues to be the dominant religion. The first Protestant church, Iglesia de la Sant√≠sima Trinidad, was established in Ponce by the Anglican Diocese of Antigua in 1872.[252] It was the first non-Catholic church in the entire Spanish Empire in the Americas.[253][254] Sources differ on the denominational breakdown of the population. Pollster Pablo Ramos stated in 1998 that the population was 38 percent Catholic, 28 percent Pentecostal, and 18 percent independent churches; the total number of Protestants collectively added up to almost two million people, or 46 percent of the population. Another researcher gave a more conservative assessment of the proportion of Protestants in 1997, finding a Protestant population of approximately 33 to 38 percent, the majority of whom are Pentecostal; however, it estimated that Puerto Rico would become 75 percent evangelical by 2022.[255] A 2014 Pew Research report found that only 56% of Puerto Ricans were Catholic, while 33% were Protestant and 8% were unaffiliated;[256][245] these figures are shared by the CIA World Factbook, which further notes that Protestants are \"largely Pentecostal\", while other religions make up 2 percent and atheists only one percent.[257] Pew Research from the year before, which surveyed Puerto Ricans living in the mainland United States, found that only about 45% of Puerto Rican adults identified themselves as Catholic, 29% as Protestant and 20% as unaffiliated with a religion.[258] By contrast, an Associated Press article in March 2014 stated that \"more than 70 percent\" of Puerto Ricans identified as Catholic.[259] There is a small Eastern Orthodox community, centered mostly around two Eastern Orthodox Churches in the territory: the Russian Orthodox mission of Saint John Climacus in San German and the Saint George Antiochian Orthodox Church in Carolina; both have services in English and Spanish.[260][261] There is a small Syriac Orthodox church in Aguada, which represents the only Oriental Orthodox denomination in the Island. Orthodox Christians accounted for one percent of the population in 2010.[262] In 2017, the first Eastern Catholic Church was established in Puerto Rico.[263][264] In 2023, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints dedicated a temple in San Juan,[265] and reported having a membership of approximately 23,000 in the commonwealth.[266] In 2015, the 25,832 Jehovah's Witnesses represented about 0.70% of the population, with 324 congregations.[267] Puerto Rico has the largest Jewish community in the Caribbean, at roughly 3,000,[268] and is the only Caribbean island where Conservative, Reform and Orthodox Jewish movements are all represented.[269][270] The island's first synagogue, Sha'are Zedeck, was established in 1952 by American Jews.[271][272][269] In 2007, there were about 5,000 Muslims in Puerto Rico, representing about 0.13% of the population.[273][274] Eight mosques are located throughout the island, with most Muslims living in R√≠o Piedras and Caguas; most Muslims are of Palestinian and Jordanian descent.[275][276] There is also a Bah√° º√≠ community.[277] Buddhism in Puerto Rico is represented with Nichiren, Zen and Tibetan Buddhism, with the New York Padmasambhava Buddhist Center for example having a branch in San Juan.[278] There are several atheist activist and educational organizations, and an atheistic parody religion called the Pastafarian Church of Puerto Rico.[279] An ISKCON temple in Gurabo is devoted to Krishna, with two preaching centers in the San Juan metropolitan area. Ta√≠no religious practices have been rediscovered and reinvented to some degree by a handful of advocates.[280] Similarly, some aspects of African religious traditions have persisted, as African slaves maintained various ethnic African religious practices associated with different peoples; in particular, the Yoruba beliefs of Santer√≠a or If√°, and the Kongo-derived Palo Mayombe. Some indigenous and African practices and beliefs are syncretized with Christianity. In 1940, Juanita Garc√≠a Peraza founded the Mita Congregation, the first religion of Puerto Rican origin.[281] The first school in Puerto Rico was the Escuela de Gram√°tica (Grammar School). It was established by Bishop Alonso Manso in 1513, in the area where the Cathedral of San Juan was to be constructed. The school was free of charge and the courses taught were Latin language, literature, history, science, art, philosophy and theology.[282] Education in Puerto Rico is divided in three levels‚ÄîPrimary (elementary school grades 1‚Äì6), Secondary (intermediate and high school grades 7‚Äì12), and Higher Level (undergraduate and graduate studies). As of 2002, the literacy rate of the Puerto Rican population was 94.1%; by gender, it was 93.9% for males and 94.4% for females.[283] According to the 2000 Census, 60.0% of the population attained a high school degree or higher level of education, and 18.3% has a bachelor's degree or higher. Instruction at the primary school level is compulsory between the ages of 5 and 18. As of 2010[update], there are 1539 public schools and 806 private schools.[284] The largest and oldest university system is the public University of Puerto Rico (UPR) with 11 campuses. The largest private university systems on the island are the Sistema Universitario Ana G. Mendez which operates the Universidad del Turabo, Metropolitan University and Universidad del Este. Other private universities include the multi-campus Inter American University, the Pontifical Catholic University, Universidad Polit√©cnica de Puerto Rico, and the Universidad del Sagrado Coraz√≥n. Puerto Rico has four schools of Medicine and three ABA-approved Law Schools. In 2017, there were 69 hospitals in Puerto Rico.[285] As of 2021, average life expectancy is approximately 82.1 years according to the CIA World Factbook, an improvement from 78.7 years in 2010.[286] Reforma de Salud de Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico Health Reform) ‚Äì locally referred to as La Reforma ('The Reform') ‚Äì is a government-run program which provides medical and health care services to the indigent and impoverished, by means of contracting private health insurance companies, rather than employing government-owned hospitals and emergency centers. The Reform is administered by the Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration.[287] Modern Puerto Rican culture is a unique mix of cultural antecedents: including European (predominantly Spanish, Italian, French, German and Irish), African, and, more recently, some North American and many South Americans. Many Cubans and Dominicans have relocated to the island in the past few decades. From the Spanish, Puerto Rico received the Spanish language, the Catholic religion and the vast majority of their cultural and moral values and traditions. The United States added English-language influence, the university system and the adoption of some holidays and practices. On 12 March 1903, the University of Puerto Rico was officially founded, branching out from the \"Escuela Normal Industrial\", a smaller organization that was founded in Fajardo three years earlier. Much of Puerto Rican culture centers on the influence of music and has been shaped by other cultures combining with local and traditional rhythms. Early in the history of Puerto Rican music, the influences of Spanish and African traditions were most noticeable. The cultural movements across the Caribbean and North America have played a vital role in the more recent musical influences which have reached Puerto Rico.[288][289] Puerto Rico has many symbols, but only the Flor de Maga has been made official by the Government of Puerto Rico.[290] Other popular, traditional, or unofficial symbols of Puerto Rico are the Puerto Rican spindalis, the kapok tree, the coqu√≠ frog, the j√≠baro, the Ta√≠no Indian, and Cerro Las Tetas with its j√≠baro culture monument.[291][292] The architecture of Puerto Rico demonstrates a broad variety of traditions, styles and national influences accumulated over four centuries of Spanish rule, and a century of American rule. Spanish colonial architecture, Ibero-Islamic, art deco, post-modern, and many other architectural forms are visible throughout the island. From town to town, there are also many regional distinctions. Old San Juan is one of the two barrios, in addition to Santurce, that made up the municipality of San Juan from 1864 to 1951, at which time the former independent municipality of R√≠o Piedras was annexed. With its abundance of shops, historic places, museums, open air caf√©s, restaurants, gracious homes, tree-shaded plazas, and its old beauty and architectonical peculiarity, Old San Juan is a main spot for local and internal tourism. The district is also characterized by numerous public plazas and churches including San Jos√© Church and the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista, which contains the tomb of the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Le√≥n. It also houses the oldest Catholic school for elementary education in Puerto Rico, the Colegio de P√°rvulos, built in 1865. The oldest parts of the district of Old San Juan remain partly enclosed by massive walls. Several defensive structures and notable forts, such as the emblematic Fort San Felipe del Morro, Fort San Crist√≥bal, and El Palacio de Santa Catalina, also known as La Fortaleza, acted as the primary defenses of the settlement which was subjected to numerous attacks. La Fortaleza continues to serve also as the executive mansion for the governor of Puerto Rico. Many of the historic fortifications are part of San Juan National Historic Site. During the 1940s, sections of Old San Juan fell into disrepair, and many renovation plans were suggested. There was even a strong push to develop Old San Juan as a \"small Manhattan\". Strict remodeling codes were implemented to prevent new constructions from affecting the common colonial Spanish architectural themes of the old city. When a project proposal suggested that the old Carmelite Convent in San Juan be demolished to erect a new hotel, the Institute had the building declared as a historic building, and then asked that it be converted to a hotel in a renewed facility. This was what became the Hotel El Convento in Old San Juan. The paradigm to reconstruct and renovate the old city and revitalize it has been followed by other cities in the Americas, particularly Havana, Lima and Cartagena de Indias. Ponce Creole is a unique architectural style created in Ponce, Puerto Rico, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This style of Puerto Rican buildings is found predominantly in residential homes in Ponce that developed between 1895 and 1920. Ponce Creole architecture borrows heavily from the traditions of France, Spain and the Caribbean vernacular to create houses that were especially built to withstand the hot and dry climate of the region, and to take advantage of the sun and sea breezes characteristic of the southern Puerto Rico's Caribbean Sea coast.[293] It is a blend of wood and masonry, incorporating architectural elements of other styles, from Classical revival and Spanish Revival to Victorian.[294] Puerto Rican art reflects many influences, much from its ethnically diverse background. A form of folk art, called santos evolved from the Catholic Church's use of sculptures to convert indigenous Puerto Ricans to Christianity. Santos depict figures of saints and other religious icons and are made from native wood, clay, and stone. After shaping simple, they are often finished by painting them in vivid colors. Santos vary in size, with the smallest examples around eight inches tall and the largest about twenty inches tall. Traditionally, santos were seen as messengers between the earth and Heaven. As such, they occupied a special place on household altars, where people prayed to them, asked for help, or tried to summon their protection. Also popular, caretas or vejigantes are masks worn during carnivals. Similar masks signifying evil spirits were used in both Spain and Africa, though for different purposes. The Spanish used their masks to frighten lapsed Christians into returning to the church, while tribal Africans used them as protection from the evil spirits they represented. True to their historic origins, Puerto Rican caretas always bear at least several horns and fangs. While usually constructed of papier-m√¢ch√©, coconut shells and fine metal screening are sometimes used as well. Red and black were the typical colors for caretas but their palette has expanded to include a wide variety of bright hues and patterns. Puerto Rican literature evolved from the art of oral story telling to its present-day status. Written works by the native islanders of Puerto Rico were prohibited and repressed by the Spanish colonial government. Only those who were commissioned by the Spanish Crown to document the chronological history of the island were allowed to write. Diego de Torres Vargas was allowed to circumvent this strict prohibition and in 1647 wrote Descripci√≥n de la Ciudad e Isla de Puerto Rico (\"Description of the Island and City of Puerto Rico\"). This historical book was the first to make a detailed geographic description of the island.[296] Some of Puerto Rico's earliest writers were influenced by the teachings of Rafael Cordero. Among these was Manuel A. Alonso, the first Puerto Rican writer of notable importance. In 1849 he published El G√≠baro, a collection of verses whose main themes were the poor Puerto Rican country farmer. Eugenio Mar√≠a de Hostos wrote La peregrinaci√≥n de Bayo√°n in 1863, which used Bartolom√© de las Casas as a springboard to reflect on Caribbean identity. After this first novel, Hostos abandoned fiction in favor of the essay which he saw as offering greater possibilities for inspiring social change. In the late 19th century, with the arrival of the first printing press and the founding of the Royal Academy of Belles Letters, Puerto Rican literature began to flourish. The first writers to express their political views in regard to Spanish colonial rule of the island were journalists. Alejandro Tapia y Rivera, also known as the Father of Puerto Rican Literature, ushered in a new age of historiography with the publication of The Historical Library of Puerto Rico. Cayetano Coll y Toste was another Puerto Rican historian and writer. His work The Indo-Antillano Vocabulary is valuable in understanding the way the Ta√≠nos lived. Manuel Zeno Gand√≠a in 1894 wrote La Charca and talked about the harsh life in the remote and mountainous coffee regions in Puerto Rico. Antonio S. Pedreira, described in his work Insularismo the cultural survival of the Puerto Rican identity after the American invasion. With the Puerto Rican diaspora of the 1940s, Puerto Rican literature was greatly influenced by a phenomenon known as the Nuyorican Movement. Puerto Rican literature continued to flourish, and many Puerto Ricans have since distinguished themselves as authors, journalists, poets, novelists, playwrights, essayists, and screenwriters. The influence of Puerto Rican literature has transcended the boundaries of the island to the U.S. and the rest of the world. Over the past fifty years, significant writers include Ed Vega (Omaha Bigelow), Miguel Pi√±ero (Short Eyes), Piri Thomas (Down These Mean Streets), Giannina Braschi (Yo-Yo Boing!), Rosario Ferrer (Eccentric Neighborhoods). and Esmeralda Santiago (When I was Puerto Rican).[297][298] The mass media in Puerto Rico includes local radio stations, television stations and newspapers, the majority of which are conducted in Spanish. There are also three stations of the U.S. Armed Forces Radio and Television Service. Newspapers with daily distribution are El Nuevo D√≠a, El Vocero and √çndice, Metro, and Primera Hora. El Vocero is distributed free of charge, as are √çndice and Metro. Newspapers distributed on a weekly or regional basis include Claridad, La Perla del Sur, La Opini√≥n, Visi√≥n, and La Estrella del Norte, among others. Several television channels provide local content in the island. These include WIPR-TV, Telemundo, Univision affiliate WLII-DT (Teleonce), WAPA-TV, and WKAQ-TV. The music of Puerto Rico has evolved as a heterogeneous and dynamic product of diverse cultural resources. The most conspicuous musical sources have been Spain and West Africa, although many aspects of Puerto Rican music reflect origins elsewhere in Europe and the Caribbean and, over the last century, from the U.S. Puerto Rican music culture today comprises a wide and rich variety of genres, ranging from indigenous genres like bomba, plena, aguinaldo, danza and the popular salsa to recent hybrids like reggaeton. Puerto Rico has some national instruments, like the cuatro (Spanish for \"four\"). The cuatro is a local instrument that was made by the \"Jibaro\" or people from the mountains. Originally, the Cuatro consisted of four steel strings, hence its name, but currently the Cuatro consists of five double steel strings. It is easily confused with a guitar, even by locals. When held upright, from right to left, the strings are G, D, A, E, B. In the realm of classical music, the island hosts two main orchestras, the Orquesta Sinf√≥nica de Puerto Rico and the Orquesta Filarm√≥nica de Puerto Rico. The Casals Festival takes place annually in San Juan, drawing in classical musicians from around the world. With respect to opera, the legendary Puerto Rican tenor Antonio Paoli was so celebrated, that he performed private recitals for Pope Pius X and Tsar Nicholas II of Russia. In 1907, Paoli was the first operatic artist in world history to record an entire opera ‚Äì when he participated in a performance of Pagliacci by Ruggiero Leoncavallo in Milan, Italy. Puerto Rico has been commemorated on four U.S. postal stamps. Insular Territories were commemorated in 1937, the third stamp honored Puerto Rico featuring 'La Fortaleza', the Spanish Governor's Palace.[299] The first free election for governor of the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico was honored on 27 April 1949, at San Juan, Puerto Rico. 'Inauguration' on the 3-cent stamp refers to the election of Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, the first democratically elected governor of Puerto Rico.[300] San Juan, Puerto Rico was commemorated with an 8-cent stamp on its 450th anniversary issued 12 September 1971, featuring a sentry box from Castillo San Felipe del Morro.[301] In the \"Flags of our nation series\" 2008‚Äì2012, of the fifty-five, five territorial flags were featured. Forever stamps included the Puerto Rico Flag illustrated by a bird issued 2011.[302] Puerto Rican cuisine has its roots in the cooking traditions and practices of Europe (Spain), Africa and the native Ta√≠nos. Basic ingredients include grains and legumes, herbs and spices, starchy tropical tubers, vegetables, meat and poultry, seafood and shellfish, and fruits.

                "content": "Puerto Rico, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (Spanish: Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico), is a U.S. territory in the Caribbean Sea.[20] This means that it belongs to the United States and citizens of Puerto Rico are citizens of the United States as well. Puerto Rico is not an independent country, but like all populated U.S. territories, it enjoys a greater degree of autonomy than U.S. states. There has been a movement for independence for almost two centuries. There have been protests, votes, and armed attacks for independence.[21][22][23] Puerto Rico has about 3.3 million (3,300,000) people. Its political system is based on a republican system. It has two official languages: Spanish and English, but Spanish is almost only used by the government, the legislature and the judiciary (courts). Spanish is also the main language of the school curriculum, though English is taught in all schools as a second language (from grade 1 to 12). Puerto Rico is one of two U.S. territories where the metric system is officially used and is dominant. (The other is Guam, which was also a Spanish colony. The metric system was introduced to both territories, before they became U.S. territories.)[24] Spanish is spoken by 94.7% of the population and English is spoken by 5.3% of the population as a mother language. The currency used is the United States dollar. The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico includes the largest, main island and a number of smaller islands, including Mona, Vieques, and Culebra. Of those three smaller islands, only Culebra and Vieques are populated all year. Mona is unpopulated, but employees of the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources sometimes visit the island to inspect it and its wildlife. People can visit the island for hiking and camping by getting the permission needed. San Juan, on the northern side of the main island, is the island's largest city and the capital of the territory. Puerto Rico means \"rich port\" in Spanish. On May 3, 2017, Puerto Rico filed for bankruptcy after a massive debt and weak economy.[25] It is the largest bankruptcy case in American history.[25] Puerto Rico is one of the unincorporated territories of the USA. These are organized, self-governing territories with locally elected governors and legislatures. Because it is not a state, its citizens can not vote in U.S. national elections unless they have an address in one of the 50 US states. Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens and can move to or from the 50 states. Puerto Rico elects a Resident Commissioner to the U.S. House of Representatives.[26] The history of Puerto Rico began when the Ortoiroid people started living in the island between 3000 and 2000 BC. Other tribes, for example the Saladoid and Arawak Indians, lived in the island between 430 BC and 1000 AD. When Christopher Columbus arrived at the island in 1492 and named it San Juan Bautista,[27] the people living there were the Ta√≠nos.[28][29] Since it is in the northeastern Caribbean Sea, Puerto Rico formed an important part of the Spanish Empire from the early years of the exploration, conquest, and colonization of the New World. The Spanish spread race-based slavery across the island. In the 19th century, slave revolts and the abolitionist movement brought an end to legal slavery.[30] The island was a major military post during many wars between Spain and other European countries for control of the region in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. In 1898, during the Spanish-American war, Puerto Rico was invaded and became a possession of the United States. During the 20th century, Puerto Rico's political status changed from time to time. The Foraker Act of 1900 created a civil government to replace the military government made after the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican war, and the Jones Act of 1917 gave Puerto Rican people United States citizenship. Afterwards. In 1932, the name Porto Rico was changed to Puerto Rico. in 1952, the drafting of Puerto Rico's own Constitution and democratic elections were established. A 1948 law called the Ley de la Mordaza (Gag Law) made it illegal to speak in favor of Puerto Rican independence or even display the Puerto Rican flag. This law, implemented by the U.S. colonial government, was used to persecute and imprison Puerto Rican independence leaders, instilling fear in the population, and discouraging any form of nationalist and patriotic expression.[31] The political status of Puerto Rico, a Commonwealth controlled by the United States, is still not completely defined. Many people want to resolve this status, while others want the status to remain the same. Of the people who want to change the status, some want Puerto Rico to become a new U.S. state, while others want Puerto Rico to become a fully independent country. In May 2022, Members of Congress sponsoring competing bills on how to resolve Puerto Rico‚Äôs territorial status and its relationship to the U.S. have come together to introduce new legislation combining both. The proposed legislation combines elements of the pro-statehood bill introduced by Rep. Darren Soto, D-Fla., and Rep. Jenniffer Gonzalez, Puerto Rico‚Äôs nonvoting member of Congress and a Republican, alongside the Puerto Rico Self-Determination Act from Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Nydia Vel√°zquez, both New York Democrats. The draft legislation says that a plebiscite to resolve Puerto Rico‚Äôs political status shall be held on November 5, 2023.[1] On December 15, 2022, the U.S. House of Representatives voted in favor of the Puerto Rico Status Act. The act sought to resolve Puerto Rico's status and its relationship to the United States through a binding plebiscite.[32] Puerto Rico is an archipelago, with a main island where most of the population lives, two smaller islands (Vieques and Culebra) with residents, and many other smaller islands. The main island has a mountain range in the center, which covers most of the island. The highest point is 4,390 feet (1,338 meters) Puerto Rico has three main political parties: the Puerto Rican Independence Party, which favors Puerto Rico becoming an independent nation; the New Progressive Party, which supports Puerto Rico's transition to becoming a state of the U.S; and the Popular Democratic Party, which supports Colonialism. The issue of the political status of the island (meaning whether it's a country, a U.S. state, or a colony) is an issue of debate amongst the Puerto Rican people. In the past there have been many attempts to clearly define the island's political status by means of voting. Most of the time the majority of the people have chosen to remain a colony. However, in the last \"status voting\" the colonial option appeared to have lost well over 90% of its support, while the U.S. state option has only gained strength in the last few decades. The Puerto Rican Independence party, on the other hand, has mainly lost a great deal of support within the last six decades (60 years). Puerto Rico is said to comprise a White majority, an extinct Amerindian population, persons of mixed ancestry, Africans and a small Asian minority. Recent genetic research, however, contradicts that information. According to the 2010 US Census, 99% of the population consider themselves of Puerto Rican descent (regardless of race or skin color), making Puerto Rico one of the most culturally unified societies in the world. The population of Puerto Rico is nearly about 4 million people. The ethnic composition of the population is: Puerto Rico has a strong literary tradition. The most important playwrights are Ren√© Marqu√©s (author of \"The Oxcart\") and Lin Manuel Miranda (creator of the Broadway musical \"Hamilton\"). The most famous poets are Julia de Burgos (\"Yo fui mi ruta\")[33] and Giannina Braschi[34] (author the poetry epic \"Empire of Dreams\"). Celebrated Puerto Rican novelists include Rosario Ferre (Eccentric Neighborhoods), Giannina Braschi (United States of Banana), and Esmeralda Santiago (When I Was Puerto Rican).[35] Puerto Rican poets who live in New York are called Nuyorican poets. Jos√© Campeche (1751-1809) is the first known Puerto Rican painter.[36] He painted in the best rococo style. Franciso Oller painted Puerto Rican landscapes and still life paintings the 19th Century. In the 20th century Franciso Rod√≥n who paints portraits of celebrities.[37] In the 21st century, Allora and Calzadilla are conceptual artists in San Juan, Puerto Rico.[38] Puerto Rico music is often called Latin music. There are many popular styes of Puerto Rican dance music, including Salsa, Bomba, Plena, and Reggaeton.[39] One of the most popular bands today is Calle 13.[40] World famous Puerto Rican singers include Jennifer Lopez, Hector Lavoe, Tito Puentes, and Marc Anthony. Ricky Martin won the 1999 Grammy Award for \"Best Latin Pop Performance\" for Living La Vida Loca.[39] Puerto Rican philosophy deals with Puerto Rican independence, education, racism, and liberty for all. The first major Puerto Rican philosopher was Eugenio Mar√≠a de Hostos.[41] He was born in the 19th Century in Puerto Rico. He believed that Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Cuba should unite to be free from Colonial powers. Francisco Jos√© Ramos was born in the 20th century. His philosophy deals with Ancient Greeks, American imperialism, and Buddhism.[42] Giannina Braschi is a contemporary political philosopher. She writes about freedom, immigration, revolution, and justice.[43] Braschi was inspired by a major Mexican woman philosopher Sor Juana Inez de la Cruz.[44] Puerto Rican philosophers are sometimes called Latinx philosophers or Latin American philosophers.",

I definitely think we should all have the right to love, and love publicly, the people that we want to love.\" Underwood went on to say, \"Our church is gay-friendly. Above all, God wanted us to love others. It's not about setting rules, or [saying] 'everyone has to be like me'. No. We're all different. That's what makes us special. We have to love each other and get on with each other. It's not up to me to judge anybody.\"[490] Underwood launched the Academy of Country Music Lifting Lives Temporary Home Fund in 2010. The Fund specifically benefits victims of the Tennessee floods of early 2010 and it was kicked off with grants that Underwood received from ACM as Entertainer of the Year.

Underwood released her debut book, Find Your Path, on March 3, 2020, published by Dey Street Books.[308] It became a New York Times best seller, debuting at number two on the How-To and Miscellaneous list.[505] This book contains insight into Carrie's lifestyle and aims to help people find their lifestyle. This book also contains some of her favorite recipes.[506] Underwood was first linked to NHL player Mike Fisher after they met at one of her concerts in late 2008, and they became engaged in December 2009.[507] According to The Canadian Press, Fisher proposed in Ottawa on December 20, 2009.[508] Underwood's engagement ring features a yellow diamond and was valued at $150,000.[509] On July 10, 2010, Underwood and Fisher wed at the Ritz-Carlton Lodge in Greensboro, Georgia, with more than 250 people in attendance.[510][511] The couple's first son was born on February 27, 2015.[512] Their second son was born on January 21, 2019.[513][514][515] Between the births of her two sons, Underwood had three miscarriages. In 2018, she told CBS News that this was the basis for her song \"Cry Pretty\", as \"I would have these horrible things going on in my life, and then have to go smile and, like, do some interviews or, like, do a photo shoot or something\".[516] On February 11, 2011, an Ottawa radio station, 105.3 KISS-FM, stated that it would ban the playing of Underwood's music because her husband, Mike Fisher, was traded to the Nashville Predators the day before.[517] Due to Underwood's fans' threats on Facebook to never tune into the radio station, the station later apologized for its actions, saying that its statements were meant to be taken as a joke, as it does not play Underwood's country songs anyway, and it was its \"tongue-in-cheek way of wishing Fisher the best of luck in Nashville.\"[518] Fisher later criticized the station saying \"obviously Carrie had nothing to do with the move or the trade or anything so to imply something like that was just wrong\", and noting that both he and Underwood were disappointed in the negativity the radio station created.[519] Underwood was selected by The Hockey News on its annual list of the 100 People of Power and Influence in Ice Hockey. For the 2012 list, Underwood ranked at number 85.[520] In 2010, Underwood and Fisher bought a mansion on eleven acres near Ottawa in the luxurious Spruce Ridge district. The couple later put the mansion up for sale at an asking price of $2.2 million.[521] In 2012, the couple bought a cottage outside of Nashville. They use the cottage for weekend getaways. Oprah toured the cottage and interviewed Underwood and Fisher there for their appearance on Oprah's Next Chapter.[522] Underwood is a practicing Evangelical Christian,[523][524] and a vegetarian.[525] She stopped eating meat at the age of 13 because she could not stand the thought of eating one of her own animals. She was voted \"World's Sexiest Vegetarian\" by PETA[526] in 2007 for the second time, the first being in 2005 alongside Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, who was himself a vegetarian at the time.[526][527] In a 2007 interview with PETA, Underwood stated, \"Ever since I was little I loved animals ... If you told me I could never sing again, I'd say that was horrible, but it's not my life. If you told me I could never be around animals again, I would just die.\"[528][529] In April 2022, Underwood shared the loss of her dog, Ace, whom she had adopted in 2007.[530] Ten months later, Underwood shared she had adopted a new dog, named Charlie, who she met backstage while touring in Charlotte, North Carolina.[531] In April 2013, Underwood spoke out with disapproval regarding the Tennessee \"Ag Gag bill\".[532] The bill makes it a crime to videotape animal cruelty or abuse and then fail to turn in the evidence to authorities within 48 hours. This is to stop animal rights activists from accumulating enough documentation to prove that animal cruelty is routine in big agribusiness.[533] Underwood tweeted, \"Shame on TN lawmakers for passing the Ag Gag bill. If Gov. Bill Haslam signs this, he needs to expect me at his front door. Who's with me?\"[534] State Rep. Andy Holt responded to her tweet, saying, \"I would say that Carrie Underwood will stick to singing, I'll stick to lawmaking.\"[535] Underwood later responded via Twitter, \"I should stick to singing? Wow...sorry, I'm just a tax-paying citizen concerned for the safety of my family. #NoAgGag\".[536] She also tweeted Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam, saying \"Please don't sign the Ag Gag bill. Think about the welfare of the animals as well as the consumers. I'm begging you...\"[537] Underwood has stated that she has a great interest in sports. She has participated in the annual City of Hope Celebrity Softball tournament for charity for many years. The event takes place in Nashville, Tennessee, and benefits research for life-threatening diseases.[538] In 2005, she performed the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" at Game 4 of the NBA Finals between the San Antonio Spurs and Detroit Pistons,[539] and in 2006 at the NBA All-Star Game.[540] She performed at halftime of the 2006 Thanksgiving Day football game at Texas Stadium in Irving, Texas, and was friends with Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo.[541] She also performed the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" at the NFC Championship Game between the Seattle Seahawks and Carolina Panthers in 2006,[542] as well as at the 2006 edition of NASCAR's Coca-Cola 600,[543] the MLB All Star Game in Pittsburgh, and at Game 3 of the 2007 World Series between the Boston Red Sox and Colorado Rockies.[544] On February 7, 2010, Underwood performed the National Anthem for Super Bowl XLIV.[545] Underwood has performed the opening theme song for NBC Sunday Night Football since 2013.[546] Faith Hill, whom Underwood replaced, later expressed full support for Underwood, congratulating her via Twitter and stating that it was \"an awesome choice\" by NBC/SNF and that Underwood \"will rock it\".[547] Underwood's original song was a modification of her song \"Oh, Sunday Night\", but was changed to an original song, \"Game On\", for the 2018 NFL season.[citation needed] She sang the National Anthem for the Nashville Predators prior to their victory over the Chicago Blackhawks in Game 3 of the first round of the 2017 Stanley Cup Playoffs and prior to their victory over the Winnipeg Jets in Game 2 of the second round of the 2018 Stanley Cup Playoffs.[citation needed] ‚Ä†Honorary former member; was scheduled to be invited, but died before the invitation was extended",

                "content": "NWS All NOAA Safety National Program Lake effect snow is common across the Great Lakes region during the late fall and winter. Lake Effect snow occurs when cold air, often originating from Canada, moves across the open waters of the Great Lakes. As the cold air passes over the unfrozen and relatively warm waters of the Great Lakes, warmth and moisture are transferred into the lowest portion of the atmosphere. The air rises, clouds form and grow into narrow band that produces 2 to 3 inches of snow per hour or more. Wind direction is a key component in determining which areas will receive lake effect snow. Heavy snow may be falling in one location, while the sun may be shining just a mile or two away in either direction. The physical geography of the land and water is also important. National Weather Service meteorologists consider these factors as well as others when forecasting lake effect snow.

The Longhorns compete in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly Division I-A) as a member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). Their home games are played at Darrell K Royal‚ÄìTexas Memorial Stadium in Austin, Texas. With over 900 wins, and an all-time win‚Äìloss percentage of .704, the Longhorns rank 4th (tied) and 12th on the all-time wins and win‚Äìloss records lists, respectively. Additionally, the program claims 4 national championships, 33 conference championships, 100 First Team All-Americans (62 consensus and 25 unanimous), and 2 Heisman Trophy winners. Beginning in 1893, the Texas Longhorns football program is one of the most highly regarded and historic programs of all time.[4] From 1936 to 1946 the team was led by Hall of Fame coach Dana X. Bible,[5] and then from 1957 to 1976 the team was led by Hall of Fame coach Darrell K Royal,[6] who won three national championships.[7] The first championship was in 1963 and the second was in 1969.[6] In 2009, ESPN ranked Texas as the seventh-most prestigious college football program since 1936.[8] In 2012, the football program was valued at $805 million,[9] more than the calculated value of several NFL teams.[citation needed] Texas is known for their post-season appearances, ranking second in number of bowl game appearances (55),[10] fourth in bowl game victories (29), most Southwest Conference football championships (27), and most Cotton Bowl Classic appearances[11] and victories. Other NCAA records include 108 winning seasons out of 122 total seasons, 24 seasons with 10 or more wins, 9 undefeated seasons, and 26 seasons with at most one loss or tie. From 1936 to 2012, the Longhorns football teams have been in the AP or coaches' rankings 66 out of 76 seasons (86.8% of the time), finishing those seasons ranked in the top twenty-five 48 times and the top ten 28 times. Texas claims four Division I-A national championships (1963, 1969, 1970 and 2005) and 33 conference championships (4 Big 12 Conference, 27 Southwest Conference, and 2 Texas Intercollegiate Athletic Association). A total of 129 (53 consensus and 22 unanimous) Texas players have been named to College Football All-America Teams, while two Longhorn players, Earl Campbell (1977) and Ricky Williams (1998), have won the Heisman Trophy,[12] \"College football's most prestigious individual honor\".[13] Seventeen Longhorns have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, while four are enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. At the start of the 2019 season, Texas' all-time record was 909‚Äì371‚Äì33 (.705), which ranked as the third-most wins.[14][15] By the end of the season, Texas' record was 916‚Äì375‚Äì33 (.704), losing a spot and dropping to fourth in NCAA Division I FBS overall history.[16] In July 2021, after 25 seasons as members of the Big 12, Texas and rival Oklahoma accepted invitations to join the Southeastern Conference (SEC) no later than the 2025 season.[17] In February 2023, the Big 12 announced that the two schools had negotiated a combined $100 million early termination fee in order to leave for the SEC a year before the schools' media rights deal with the Big 12 was set to expire.[18] The Longhorns football team continued competing in the Big 12 through the 2023 season before moving to the SEC in 2024. Texas has been affiliated with four conferences and twice been an independent.[19] Texas has been selected national champion in 9 seasons from NCAA-designated major selectors, including 4 from the major wire-service: AP Poll and/or Coaches' Poll.[20]: 107‚Äì109 The 1963, 1969, 1970, and 2005 championships are claimed by the school, while the remainder are not claimed.[21] Texas has won 33 conference championships, 27 outright and six shared, spanning three conferences, the Texas Intercollegiate Athletic Association, the Southwest Conference, and the Big 12 Conference.[25][19] ‚Ä† Co-champions Texas has won a share of 7 Big 12 South titles, 5 of which resulted in an appearance in the Big 12 Championship Game. Texas is 3‚Äì2 in those appearances. As of 2011, the new ten-team Big 12 Conference ceased to have divisions and conference championship games.[26] ‚Ä† Co-champions At the end of the 2018 season, Texas is tied for second in all time bowl appearances in the NCAA FBS at 55, matching Georgia and trailing Alabama's 70 appearances.[27] (Note: Some years Texas went to two bowls although they were in different seasons) ^ The 2006 Rose Bowl was both the Rose Bowl Game and the sanctioned BCS National Championship Game, after that season the BCS NCG became a separate game unaffiliated with the major bowl games. ‚Ä† The Bluebonnet Bowl in Houston was discontinued in 1988, but was replaced by the Houston Bowl (2000‚Äì2001) and the Texas Bowl (2006‚Äìcurrent). ‚Ä° The Freedom Bowl merged with the Holiday Bowl in 1995. Texas has played in four Bowl Championship Series games (including two BCS National Championships) and one New Year's Six bowl. Texas also played in two Bowl Alliance games (the precursor to the BCS): the 1995 Sugar Bowl and the 1997 Fiesta Bowl. There have been 31 head coaches since the inaugural team in 1893, with Steve Sarkisian being the current head coach of the Longhorns.[28] The Longhorns have played their home games in Darrell K Royal‚ÄìTexas Memorial Stadium (formerly just \"Memorial Stadium\" and \"Texas Memorial Stadium\") on Campbell-Williams Field[29] since 1924. The stadium is located on the campus of The University of Texas in Austin, Texas. The current official stadium capacity is 100,119,[30] making it the second largest football venue in the state of Texas,[31] the fifth largest in the SEC Conference,[32] the fifth largest on-campus stadium in the NCAA, and the seventh largest non-racing stadium in the world. The stadium has been expanded several times since its original opening, and now includes 100,119 permanent seats, the nation's first high definition video display in a collegiate facility nicknamed \"Godzillatron,\"[33] and a newly renovated Joe Jamail Field with FieldTurf. The current DKR-Texas Memorial Stadium and Big 12 attendance record was set on September 15, 2018, against USC with 103,507 spectators. The final planned phase of the stadium's expansion includes the construction of permanent seating and an upper deck in the south end zone, completely enclosing the playing field. The stadium's seating capacity is expected to reach 112,000 once the south end zone is fully enclosed, which would mean DKR-Texas Memorial Stadium would surpass Michigan Stadium as the largest football stadium in North America.[34] However, the date of the final construction phase to fully enclose the south end zone has not been set nor have any funds been raised. Varying sources claim this phase may not take place for upwards of 10 to 15 years, though on March 11, 2014, an announcement was made that an exploratory committee has been formed regarding the expansion of the stadium in conjunction with the construction of the Dell Medical School on campus. Before the Longhorns football team moved to DKR, they played their home games at Clark Field from 1887[35] to 1924. Clark Field was a wooden-structured stadium located on the University of Texas campus.[36] The Longhorns last game at Clark Field before moving to brand new Memorial Stadium occurred on October 25, 1924. The Longhorns battled the Florida Gators to a 7‚Äì7 tie that day.[37] Texas finished with a record of 135‚Äì23‚Äì3 during their time at Clark Field.[38] Texas has a long-standing rivalry with the University of Oklahoma. The football game between the University of Texas and Oklahoma is commonly known as the \"Red River Rivalry\" and is held annually in Dallas at the Cotton Bowl. Dallas is used as a \"neutral site\" since it is approximately midway between the two campuses. The stadium is split, with each team having an equal number of supporters on each side of the 50 yard line. Texas state flags fly around the Longhorn end of the stadium and Oklahoma state flags fly around the Sooner end. This border rivalry is often considered to be one of the top five current rivalries in the NCAA. The Red River Shootout originated in 1900, while Oklahoma was still a territory of the United States, and it is the longest-running college-football rivalry played on a neutral field.[39] Since 2005, the football game has received sponsorship dollars in return for being referred to as the \"SBC Red River Rivalry\"[40] (changed to AT&T Red River Rivalry in 2006 after SBC merged with AT&T), a move which has been criticized both for its commercialism[41] and its political correctness.[42] The University of Texas holds its annual Torchlight Parade during the week of the Red River Rivalry.[43] In 2005, the Dallas Morning News did an opinion poll of the 119 Division 1A football coaches as to the nations top rivalry game in college football. The Texas-OU game was ranked third.[44] The game typically has conference or even national significance. Since 1945, one or both of the two teams has been ranked among the top 25 teams in the nation coming into 60 out of 65 games. Twice Texas has defeated the Sooners a record eight straight times from 1940 to 1947 and 1958‚Äì1965. One of the most significant meetings was in 1963 with Oklahoma ranked No. 1 and Texas ranked No. 2, the game won by Texas 28‚Äì7 en route to their first officially recognized national championship. The series has also had its share of games that came down to the wire and comebacks most recently in 2021 which saw sixth-ranked Sooners rallying from a 21-point first-quarter deficit to edge the 21st-ranked Longhorns 55‚Äì48 in the highest-scoring game in the rivalry. The game has also been the result of controversy. The meeting in 1976 was a heated affair as the Oklahoma staff was accused of spying on Texas' practices, a move later confirmed by former OU head coach Barry Switzer. In the 2008 season Texas scored 45 points over then No. 1 Oklahoma for the win, but even with the victory Texas would not go on to the Big 12 Championship game due to BCS rankings. Six of the last ten showings featured one of the participants in the BCS National Championship Game (2000, 2003‚Äì2005, 2008, 2009), including national titles won by Oklahoma in 2000 and by Texas in 2005. On October 6, 2018, the Longhorns and Sooners squared off in a Red River Rivalry game that will go down in history. After giving up a 21-point 4th Quarter lead, the Longhorns found themselves tied at 45 with the Sooners with just over two minutes left to play in the game. As the Longhorns began to systematically march down the field, time began to run out. However, a Cameron Dicker 40 yard field goal sealed a 48‚Äì45 win for the Longhorns and finally ended the 2-year drought in the Red River Rivalry. In 2022, Texas shut out Oklahoma, beating them 49-0. This was the most dominant win by either side since 2003, and the first shut out since 2004. Texas leads the all-time series 63‚Äì51‚Äì5 through the 2023 season.[45][46] In 2023 Oklahoma surpassed Texas A&M as UT‚Äôs most played football rivalry game. The first meeting between the Texas Longhorns and Texas Tech Matadors (as the team was known until 1937) was in 1928, a 12‚Äì0 win for Texas. The teams only faced each other nine times before 1960 with Texas holding an 8‚Äì1 record over Tech at the time.[47] From 1960 to 1995, both schools played annually as members of the Southwest Conference. Since 1996, both schools have played as members of the Big 12 Conference.[48] In 1996, the Texas Tech University System was established and the system's first chancellor, John T. Montford, a former member of the Texas State Senate, started the exchange of a traveling trophy between the two universities called the Chancellor's Spurs.[49][50] The spurs are gold and silver and engraved with Texas Tech's Double T and Texas' interlocking UT logo and were first awarded to Texas after a 38‚Äì32 victory over the Red Raiders in Lubbock.[50] Texas leads the all-time series 54‚Äì18 through the 2023 season.[51] Old Southwest Conference rivals, Texas and Arkansas first met in 1894, a 54‚Äì0 win by Texas. In the days of the Southwest Conference, the game between the two schools usually decided which team would win the conference championship. Overall, Texas won the game about 71% of the time, which led to an incredibly fierce and intense rivalry. The two programs have met 79 times and have had many big games. The meeting in 1969 is the true Game of the Century commemorating the 100th year of college football, which led to the Longhorns' 1969 national championship. This game, which is commonly known as \"Dixie's Last Stand\" and The Big Shootout, still does not sit well with Razorback fans to this day.[52] The game saw Arkansas lead throughout only to have Texas come from behind and win in the final minutes, 15‚Äì14. The game also saw former President Richard Nixon attend the game and crown the Longhorns the National Champion in the locker room. The Texas-Arkansas game has not been played annually since Arkansas's departure from the Southwest Conference to the Southeastern Conference in 1991. However, many Longhorn and Razorback fans still consider this matchup an important rivalry. Texas and Arkansas played in September 2008, with Texas winning, 52‚Äì10. Texas and Arkansas also played in the 2014 Texas Bowl, which Arkansas won, 31‚Äì7. Texas and Arkansas played in the 2021 regular season, with Arkansas winning by a score of 40-21. Texas leads the series 57‚Äì23 through the 2024 season.[53] The first meeting between the football squads of the University of Texas and Texas A&M was in 1894, a 38‚Äì0 win for Texas. In fact, Texas won its first seven games against the Aggies, all of them by shutout. By 1915 Texas held a 15‚Äì4‚Äì2 advantage against the Aggies. The game was a back and forth affair for the next twenty years as the home team usually took the victory in the game, however Texas still maintained the series lead. In 1940, Texas shutout the Aggies 7‚Äì0 and kept them from receiving the Rose Bowl bid that year. From that year forward Texas would go on to win 33 of the next 38 games over A&M. It was not until the mid-1980s that A&M developed a win streak over Texas and in the late 1990s and 2000s the rivalry would again go back to Longhorns.[54] The Texas/Texas A&M rivalry has given rise to several stereotypes on both sides: Texas A&M is generally portrayed as the rural smaller school while Texas is portrayed as the urban-wealthy larger school. With the exception of the 1994 game, when A&M's probation restricted the Aggies from being televised, the annual football game with Texas A&M traditionally takes place on Thanksgiving Day or the day after each year. This iconic in-state rivalry is often considered one of the top college rivalries of all time. In July 2011, Texas A&M elected to join the Southeastern Conference beginning in 2012, which ended of the 118-year consecutive meetings between the two schools. On November 24, 2011, Texas faced Texas A&M in College Station in the final scheduled meeting of the rivalry as of January 2019. Texas defeated Texas A&M 27‚Äì25 on a last second field goal to win the final meeting. In an attempt to generate more attention for the rivalry in sports other than football, the two schools created the Lone Star Showdown[55] in 2004. Essentially, each time the two schools meet in a sport, the winner of the matchup gets a point. At the end of the year, the school with the most points wins the series and receives the Lone Star Trophy. Texas leads the series 76‚Äì37‚Äì5 through the 2023 season.[56] The rivalry will resume when Texas moves to the Southeastern Conference in 2024. Baylor and Texas have played each other 111 times, with the first game between Baylor and Texas being played in 1901. Only Oklahoma and Texas A&M have played Texas more times than Baylor. Both Baylor and Texas were founding members of the Southwest Conference and the BIG 12 Conference. Texas leads the series with Baylor 81-28-4. However, starting in 2010 this rivalry intensified as Baylor established themselves as a major contender in the BIG 12 Conference with Baylor playing for 4 BIG 12 titles and winning 3, including a head-to-head win over Texas to clinch the BIG 12 Championship in 2013, in what is now known as the \"Ice Bowl\".[57] Losing the BIG 12 Title to Baylor 30-10 was Mack Brown's last regular season game as the head coach at Texas. Since 2015, Texas holds a 7-2 edge in the series with Baylor.[58] Texas leads the series with TCU 64‚Äì28‚Äì1 through the 2023 season.[59] Texas leads the series 75‚Äì21‚Äì1 through the 2023 season. The teams were conference rivals for 81 seasons in the Southwest Conference from 1915 through 1995.[citation needed] The University of Texas has had 129 Longhorns selected to the College Football All-America Team including 62 Consensus and 25 Unanimous; Texas also has 17 players and coaches that have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.[63] Major honors Offensive honors Coaching Honors Defensive honors Other honors As of 2016, the Texas Longhorns have had 570 All-Conference Player selections since 1915, including 292 in the Southwest Conference and 278 in the Big 12 where Longhorn players have been named 78 times to the first team and 65 to the second team.[64] 351 Longhorns have been drafted into the NFL, including 44 in the 1st round.[65]As of August 7, 2024[update], the Longhorns have 44 players active on NFL rosters.[66] Texas has had 22 players and three former coaches inducted into the Hall of Fame. Texas has had 5 players inducted into the NFL Hall of Fame. One former Longhorn was inducted as an NFL head coach. The 1893 team did not always wear orange. They also wore gold and white uniforms. In 1895, the Texas Athletic Association moved to orange and white colors. In 1897, the Association moved to orange and maroon to save cleaning costs. The Cactus Yearbook at the time listed the university colors as either gold or orange and white until the 1899 Cactus declared the university colors to be gold and maroon. Students at the university's medical branch in Galveston (UTMB) were in favor of royal blue. By 1899, a UT fan could have worn any of yellow, orange, white, red, maroon, or even blue.[67] The Board of Regents held an election in that year to decide the team colors. Students, faculty, staff and alumni were asked to vote. 1,111 votes were cast, with 562 in favor of orange and white. Orange and maroon received 310, royal blue 203, crimson 10, and royal blue and crimson 11. For the next 30 years, Longhorn teams wore bright orange on their uniforms, which faded to yellow by the end of the season. By the 1920s, other teams sometimes called the Longhorn squads \"yellow bellies,\" a term that didn't sit well with the athletic department. In 1928, UT football coach Clyde Littlefield ordered uniforms in a darker shade of orange that wouldn't fade, which would later become known as \"burnt orange\" or \"Texas orange.\" The dark-orange color was used until the dye became too expensive during the Great Depression, and the uniforms reverted to the bright orange for another two decades, until coach Darrell K Royal revived the burnt-orange color in the early 1960s.[67] For the 2009 Lone Star Showdown, the Longhorns wore a Nike Pro Combat uniform. From 1961 to 1962, the Longhorns' helmets featured the individual player's number on the side in burnt orange above the \"Bevo\" logo, which was also in burnt orange, with a large burnt-orange stripe down the middle of the helmet. The burnt-orange stripe was removed in 1963 and the helmet featured only the burnt-orange Bevo logo below the player's number, which was also in burnt orange. In 1967, the team abandoned the individual player's number above the logo, and moved the burnt-orange Bevo logo to the center of the helmet's side. With the exception of the 1969 season, this remained the team's helmet design until 1977. In 1969, the helmet design commemorated the 100th anniversary of the first college football game. The player's number was replaced by a large burnt-orange football above the Bevo logo. Inside the football was a white number \"100\" that indicated the anniversary year. The University of Texas is a tradition-rich school, and many of those traditions are associated with athletics events, especially football. Some Longhorn traditions include: The Texas football program joined the SEC in 2024. The conference expanded to 16 teams.[73] Only the 2024 conference schedule was announced on June 14, 2023, while the conference still considers a new format for the future.[74] Announced schedules as of June 25, 2023.[76][77] This is subject to change based on Texas' future move to the SEC. As part of the agreement allowing Texas and Oklahoma to move from the Big 12 to the SEC in 2024, instead of 2025, the sites of the home-and-home series with Michigan, originally scheduled to be at Texas in 2024, and at Michigan in 2027, were reversed, giving Fox the right to broadcast the 2024 game at Michigan.[78] Texas Football's recruiting department is led by Billy Glasscock.[79] Glasscock came from NC State in 2021 as director of player personnel, leading a team of staffers and interns in a combination of duties between recruiting and player personnel. On the recruiting side, Taylor Searels[80] directs everything from an events standpoint to accommodate recruiting visits. In player personnel, JM Jones and Austin Shelton[81] are assistant directors of player personnel, handling offense and defense respectively. They manage a team of recruiting assistants that all manage a position and report to their position coach. This recruiting assistant program has been a robust program that has seen the likes of Daniel Bernstein - EDGE, Julian Rowe-Cohen - TEs, Maxwell Solman - OL, Jacob De Santos - DB, Jake Warren - WR, and Tanner Martin - QBs come through. Their jobs were to identify recruits, evaluate them, and bring them to their position coaches if they are deemed worth watching and offering. These are the individuals that found most of the players on the team before anyone else.",

                "content": "The Texas Longhorns are the athletic teams representing the University of Texas at Austin. The teams are sometimes referred to as the Horns and take their name from Longhorn cattle that were an important part of the development of Texas, and are now the official \"large animal\" of the state of Texas.[2] Generally, both the men's and women's teams are referred to as the Longhorns, and the mascot is a Texas Longhorn steer named Bevo. The Longhorns have consistently been ranked as the biggest brand in collegiate athletics, in both department size and breadth of appeal. The Longhorn nickname had begun appearing in Texas newspapers by 1900.[3] The University of Texas at Austin is the flagship institution of the University of Texas System. It offers a wide variety of varsity and intramural sports programs, and was selected as \"America's Best Sports College\" in a 2002 analysis by Sports Illustrated. Texas was also listed as the number one Collegiate Licensing Company client from 2005 to 2013 in regards to the amount of annual trademark royalties received from the sales of its fan merchandise.[4] Until Athletic Director Chris Del Conte altered the organizational structure of the athletic department in 2017,[5] Texas was the only remaining NCAA Division I school to operate separate men's and women's athletic departments, after the other remaining holdout, the University of Tennessee,[6] merged its men's and women's athletic departments at the end of the 2011‚Äì12 academic year.[7] A charter member of the Southwest Conference until its dissolution in 1996, the Texas Longhorns competed in the Big 12 Conference until 2024. The Texas Longhorns joined the Southeastern Conference for the 2024‚Äì2025 season with the University of Oklahoma for a reported $100 million,[8] as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The school's colors are officially Orange (Pantone 159) and White, with Burnt Orange ‚Äî also known as Texas Orange ‚Äì being the specific shade of orange used.[9][10] The University of Texas Longhorn Band performs the alma mater as well as the university fight song (\"Texas Fight\") at various sporting events. Over the years, Longhorn sports teams have won 56 total national championships,[11] 47 of which are NCAA National Championships.[12] The University of Texas currently fields a varsity team in nine men's sports and 12 women's sports.[13] In 1992, seven women athletes representing club-level rowing, soccer and gymnastics and intramural softball, organized by the rowing club coach, sued the university in U.S. District Court charging them with Title IX violations. At the time there were more men on the football team than there were varsity-level women athletes. In July 1993 Texas settled the lawsuit, agreeing to add women's rowing, soccer and softball; and agreeing to devote more than 44 percent of its varsity athletic roster spots and more than 42 percent of its athletic scholarship money to women. Women's soccer was added in 1993, softball in 1995 and rowing in 1997.[14] Two Texas Longhorn running backs have won college football's most prestigious individual award, the Heisman Trophy: Earl Campbell (1977) and Ricky Williams (1998). Seventeen Longhorn players and two Longhorn coaches have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame,[15] while four are enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[16] Other Longhorn players have also received recognition for their performance. In terms of total wins, Texas is the 2nd-ranked NCAA Division I FBS program in college football history with 891 wins, after passing Nebraska during the 2016 season. As of the end of the 2016 season, the Longhorns' all-time record is 891‚Äì359‚Äì33 (.709). Only the University of Michigan has won more games and a greater percentage of games played than Texas,[17] which recorded its 800th victory with the Longhorns' 41‚Äì38 win over the USC Trojans in the 2006 BCS National Championship Game at the Rose Bowl. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the program was somewhat less successful, but the Longhorns have since returned to prominence in college football, finishing in the top six of the AP and coaches' polls in 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2008 and 2009. The University of Texas team plays home games in Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium which has a seating capacity of 100,119.[18] Renovations began on the stadium November 14, 2005, two days following the last home football game of the 2005 season. The improvements were completed before the 2008 football season, and included additional seating[19] and the nation's first high definition video display in a collegiate facility nicknamed \"Godzillatron.\"[20] The university completed a $27 million expansion and renovation to the south end zone facilities in August 2009 which added 4,525 permanent bleacher seats and changed the playing surface to FieldTurf. With the new permanent bleacher seating section added behind the south end zone and the total remodeling of the north end zone completed in 2008, the stadium's official capacity now stands at 100,119. This was surpassed when 101,357[21] saw #3-ranked Texas beat Kansas 51‚Äì20[22] on November 21, 2009. The University of Texas began varsity intercollegiate competition in men's basketball in 1906.[23] The Longhorns rank 18th in total victories among all NCAA Division I college basketball programs and 25th in all-time win percentage among programs with at least 60 years in Division I, with an all-time win‚Äìloss record of 1791‚Äì1088 (.622).[24] Among Big 12 Conference men's basketball programs, Texas is second only to Kansas in both all-time wins and all-time win percentage.[24] The Longhorns have won 27 total conference championships in men's basketball and have made 34 total appearances in the NCAA tournament (11th-most appearances all time, with a 35‚Äì37 overall record),[25] reaching the NCAA Final Four three times (1943, 1947, 2003) and the NCAA regional finals (Elite Eight) seven times.[26][27] As of the end of the 2017‚Äì18 season, Texas ranks sixth among all Division I men's basketball programs for total NCAA Tournament games won without having won the national championship (35), trailing Kansas State (37), Notre Dame (38), Purdue (39), Illinois (40), and Oklahoma (41).[25][28] The Longhorns have also won 2 NIT championships, in 1978 and 2019. Texas's best season is arguably the 1932‚Äì33 season when the team went 22‚Äì1, won the Southwest Conference and was named unofficial National Champion by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. Since the introduction of the AP poll, Texas's best season was 2002-2003 when it went 26‚Äì7, earned a #1 seed in the NCAA tournament, made it as far as the Final Four and finished the season ranked #3 in the AP poll. The 2005‚Äì06 season marked the 100th anniversary of basketball at the University of Texas. Special logos were placed on the uniforms to commemorate this anniversary. In 2007, the men's basketball team was ranked sixth by the Harris Poll for favorite men's college basketball teams, moving up one spot from the previous year.[29] The women's basketball team has long been a national power, especially during the late 1980s (winning a national title in 1986) and through the 1990s. Both teams play home games in the Moody Center. The adjacent Denton A. Cooley Pavilion serves as the training and practice facility for both the men's and women's teams. The Texas Longhorns are the winningest team in college baseball history, both in terms of total wins and in terms of win percentage.[citation needed] Texas holds the records for most appearances in the College World Series (35) and most individual CWS games won. The Longhorns have won six NCAA baseball national championships (1949, 1950, 1975, 1983, 2002, and 2005) ‚Äî second only to Southern California's total of 12 ‚Äì and have appeared in the CWS Championship Game or Championship Series on six other occasions (1953, 1984, 1985, 1989, 2004, and 2009). Former Longhorns who have gone on to success in Major League Baseball include Roger Clemens, Bibb Falk, Ron Gardenhire, Calvin Schiraldi, Burt Hooton, Keith Moreland, Spike Owen, Greg Swindell, Huston Street, Omar Quintanilla, Taylor Teagarden, Sam LeCure and Drew Stubbs. From 1997 to 2016, the Longhorns were led by head coach Augie Garrido, the winningest coach in NCAA baseball history.[31] The team plays its home games at Disch-Falk Field. The University of Texas Longhorn's softball team was founded in 1995 as part of its 1993 Title IX settlement. It is currently led by head coach Mike White and assistant coaches Kerry Shaw and Chelsea Spencer. Texas has made 20 total appearances in the NCAA Tournament in 23 seasons of varsity competition, reaching the Women's College World Series (WCWS) five times (1998, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2013) and finishing as high as 3rd on three occasions (2003, 2005 and 2013). The University of Texas has a strong golf tradition, dating back to their first season in 1927. Since then they have won national titles back-to-back in 1971 and 1972 and again in 2012, and finished runner-up six other times (1949, 1983, 1989, 1994, 2016, 2019). Individual national champions were Ed White (1935), Ben Crenshaw (1971, 1972, and 1973), Tom Kite (1972), and Justin Leonard (1994). Longhorns who have won the U.S. Amateur include Justin Leonard and David Gossett. Two-time U.S. Junior Amateur champion and three-time major winner Jordan Spieth played for the Longhorns golf team in 2011 and 2012. In 2022, Longhorn alum Scottie Scheffler won the Masters Tournament and reached World No.1 in the Official World Golf Ranking in March 2022. Besides Majors-winners Kite, Crenshaw, Leonard and Spieth, a number of other former Longhorn players have gone on to win on the PGA Tour, including: Phil Blackmar, Mark Brooks, Jhonattan Vegas, Bob Estes, Wes Ellis, Harrison Frazar, Cody Gribble, Rik Massengale, Wes Short Jr., and Brandel Chamblee. In addition, Longhorns Brandon Stone and Dylan Frittelli have each achieved multiple wins on the European Tour. Legendary golf instructor Harvey Penick was a long-time coach at Texas. The team is currently coached by John Fields.[32] The women's golf team has been to the NCAA Championship 27 times, tied for 7th overall and finished as the runner-up, or tied for runner-up, twice, in 1993 and 2002. As of 2019, they have finished in the top 5 eight times, most recently in 2019 (t-5th) and 2003 (3rd). In 2019 Texas won its first NCAA Regional in school history and was the stroke play medalist at the NCAA Championship. Texas women have won three individual championships. In 1978 Deborah Petrizzi won the AIAW national intercollegiate individual golf championship; and Charlotta S√∂renstam and Heather Bowie won in 1993 and 1997 respectively. Former players Betsy Rawls and Sherri Steinhauer went on to win 8 and 2 LPGA major championships respectively, with Rawls being inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame. Tennis was played at The University of Texas as early as 1884, although it was not until 1909 that intercollegiate competition developed. Between that time and the advent of the Southwest Conference in 1915, Texas and Oklahoma annually held a meet for the championship of the Southwest. The first season of Texas Men's Tennis was in 1912. Since forming, the Men's Tennis team has won 17 Southwest Conference Championships, 5 Big 12 Championships and the 2019 NCAA Championship.[33] Texas teams have reached the NCAA Championship semifinals five times (1993, 2006, 2008, 2009 and 2019) and prior to the formation of the tournament when the final standings were determined by a poll, the Longhorns finished fourth or better five times, including 1946 (4th), 1952 (tie 4th), 1955 (2nd), 1957 (3rd), and 1960 (tie 4th).[34] In March 2019 tennis head coach Michael Center was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud as part of the 2019 college admissions bribery scandal.[35] Despite losing their head coach to scandal just two months earlier, the Texas Men's Tennis team won its first ever NCAA tennis championship over Wake Forest in May 2019. [36] The women's Longhorns tennis team began play in 1978, and since then has won 4 NCAA Championships (1993, 1995, 2021, 2022), 23 regular-season conference titles (three shared), 12 Big 12 tournaments and all 9 SWC tournament championships. They were also the NCAA runner-up in 1992 and 2005.[37] The men's program is coached by Edrick Flor√©al. The Longhorns were runners-up in the outdoor championships in 1987, 1988, and 1997 but have never won a title. Other notable coaches of the Texas men's program have included Bubba Thornton, who also coached the 2008 US Olympic team, Stan Huntsman (1986‚Äì95), who also coached the 1988 US Olympic team, and Clyde Littlefield (Texas coach, 1920‚Äì60), the 1925 co-founder of the annual Texas Relays. The men won four consecutive Big 12 Indoor Championships between 2006 and 2009. The men have won 41 individual titles, 10th most of all schools. The Longhorn track and field programs have produced numerous Olympians for various nations. Male medalists include Ryan Crouser (United States, gold, shot put, 2016), Leonel Manzano (United States, silver, 1500 meters, 2012), Winthrop Graham (Jamaica, silver, 400m hurdles, 1992 and 4 √ó 400 m relay, 1988), Patrick Sang (Kenya, silver, 3000m steeplechase, 1992), Du'aine Ladejo (Great Britain, bronze, 4 √ó 400 m relay, 1992), Lam Jones (USA, gold, 4 √ó 100 m relay, 1976), Eddie Southern (USA, silver, 400m hurdles, 1956), and Dean Smith (sprinter) (USA, gold, 4 √ó 100 m relay, 1952).

Other notable coaches have included Beverly Kearney, who guided the Lady Longhorns to six NCAA Championships: Indoor Championships in 1998, 1999, and 2006, and Outdoor Championships in 1998, 1999, and 2005; and Terry Crawford, whose teams won Indoor Championships in 1986, 1988, and 1990, and Outdoor Championships in 1982 and 1986. Crawford's athletes also won the 1986 Women's Cross Country Championship. The program's first title was the 1982 AIAW outdoor track and field championship. The Longhorn track and field programs have produced numerous Olympians for various nations. Female Olympic medalists have included Michelle Carter (athlete) (USA, gold, shot put, 2016), Sanya Richards-Ross (2012: USA, gold, 400 meters and 4 x 400 meter relay; 2008, bronze, 400 meters and gold, 4 x 400 meter relay, 2008), Moushami Robinson (USA, gold, 4 √ó 400 meter relay, 2004), Sandie Richards (Jamaica, silver, 4 √ó 400 m relay, 2000 and 2004), Merlene Frazer (Jamaica, silver, 4 √ó 100 m relay, 2000), Nanceen Perry (USA, bronze, 4 √ó 100 m relay, 2000), Carlette Guidry (USA, gold, 4 √ó 100 m relay, 1992 and 1996), Juliet Cuthbert (Jamaica, silver, 100m and 200m, 1992 and bronze, 4 √ó 100 m relay, 1996), and Nikole Mitchell (Jamaica, bronze, 4 √ó 100 m relay, 1996). Courtney Okolo became the first Longhorn to win The Bowerman,[38] an award that honors collegiate track & field's most outstanding athlete of the year. In 2016, she became the first female collegian to run sub-50 seconds in the 400 meters, in turn lowering her own collegiate record to 49.71. Her senior season also included an undefeated record against collegians and four NCAA titles (two individual, two relay). The men's cross country team has 33 Southwest Conference championships and has placed as high as 3rd in the NCAA Men's Division I Cross Country Championship. The 1956 individual championship was won by Walter McNew with a time of 19:55.94.[39] The women's cross country team has 4 Southwest Conference championships and won the 1986 NCAA Cross Country Championship. Texas won the 1988, 2012, 2022, and 2023 NCAA National Championships, with runner-up finishes in 1995, 2009, 2015, 2016 and 2020. They also won an AIAW national championship in 1981. The team is currently coached by Jerritt Elliott and plays home games in Gregory Gymnasium. Texas won the Big 12 Conference in 1997, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023. They finished 2nd in 1996, 1998, 2004, 2005, 2010, and 2016. They finished 3rd in 1999 and 2006. They have qualified for every NCAA tournament since 2004 and advanced to at least the Regional Finals since 2006. Texas volleyball has produced many All-Americans, and in 2007, they won the program's first Big 12 title since 1997, sharing the title with Nebraska. Texas broke Nebraska's three-year streak of winning the title outright. They also earned the programs first AVCA National Freshman of the Year since 1995 in 2007, for Big 12 Freshman of the Year Juliann Faucette, and Logan Eggleston won the program's first ever AVCA National Player of the Year award in 2022. Texas has won fifteen national titles in men's swimming and diving (1981, 1988‚Äì1991, 1996, 2000‚Äì2002, 2010, 2015‚Äì18, 2021) and nine in women's swimming and diving (1981‚Äì82, 1984‚Äì88, 1990‚Äì91), making swimming and diving the most successful Texas athletics program by far, based on number of national titles. The women's swimming team is currently coached by Carol Capitani, and the men's and women's diving teams are coached by Matt Scoggin. The men's swimming team has been coached by Eddie Reese since 1978. In 2021, Reese retired after 43 years as the Texas men's head coach. When a successful replacement was not named, Reese returned to the Head Coach position. Reese has coached numerous former and current world record holders while at Texas, including many competing in the Summer Olympic Games for the United States and other home nations. The swim team was first developed under Coach Tex Robertson.[40] The women's rowing team was established in the fall of 1998 as the result of the 1993 Title IX settlement.[41] At the team's first appearance at the NCAA championships in 2003, its varsity 8 placed 12th nationally. The team won the inaugural Big 12 Championship in 2009 and kept the championship title for the following three years. Additionally, the Texas women's rowing team won the 2011 Conference USA Championship. In June 2014, Dave O'Neill was appointed head coach of the program.[42] Under his coaching, the women's rowing team placed fourth in the 2017 NCAA Championship, third in 2018, second in 2019, and first in 2021, marking the program's best four finishes.[43] The Texas women's soccer program was established in 1993 as part of that year's Title IX settlement. Since then they have won 3 conference championships - one regular season and two tournaments ‚Äî and been to 13 NCAA tournaments, making it as far as the Sweet Sixteen in 2004, 2006, 2007 and 2017. In 2006 the Longhorns finished ranked #8 in the nation, their highest end-of-season ranking ever.[44] Founded in 1985, the Texas Longhorns rugby team plays in the Allied Rugby Conference, and plays its postseason in the Varsity Cup Championship. The Longhorns rugby program has been improving in recent years.[45] Texas rugby has instituted a combine to identify the most elite athletes on campus with an eye towards recruiting them to play rugby.[46] The increasing popularity of rugby in the United States and the announcement that rugby would return to the Summer Olympics led Texas to upgrade the designation of its rugby program from club to Olympic.[47] The Texas Rugby Alumni association and the Texas Exes have begun an endowment to award scholarships to Texas rugby players, which is viewed as a vital recruitment tool.[48] The Longhorns' improvement led to Texas winning the Southwest Conference in the 2011‚Äì12 season to qualify for the sweet sixteen of the 2012 national championship playoffs.[49] Texas won the 2012 Southwest 7s tournament to qualify for the 2012 USA Rugby Sevens Collegiate National Championships.[50] The Longhorns rugby program has been boosted by its participation in the Collegiate Rugby Championship, the highest profile college rugby competition in the US, which is broadcast live on NBC. In the 2011 CRC, Texas defeated Big 12 rival Oklahoma to reach the quarterfinals. Following Texas's participation in the 2011 CRC, Texas \"raised an additional $10,000 from alumni, landed a new apparel sponsor, and have been contacted by 90 students (including two DBs from the football team) who want to play rugby.\"[51] In the 2012 CRC, Texas defeated its rival Oklahoma to again reach the quarterfinals of the tournament. The Longhorns rugby program reached a new all-time high during the 2013‚Äì2014 season. Texas won the 2013 Southwest Conference 7s Championship advancing them to the 2013 USA Rugby Sevens Collegiate National Championships, where they finished ranked #12 in the nation.[52] Months later Texas won the 2014 Southwest Conference 15s Championship, making them the first team in the conference to win both the 7s and 15s championships in the same season. The Longhorns finished the season with their first participation in The Varsity Cup Championship, where they finished in the top 8.[53] Texas has won 58 NCAA team national championships.[56] Below are 9 national team titles that were not bestowed by the NCAA: [58][59] * Denotes shared conference title ‚Ä† Denotes an AIAW Championship. The University of Texas began NCAA and Southwest Conference competition in women's sports for the 1982‚Äì83 season. The university's biggest rival is Texas A&M University.[60][61] However, in football, Texas considers the Oklahoma Sooners to be a more significant rival. According to Bill Little, the Longhorns' assistant athletic director, the rivalry against A&M is \"based on respect\", while the rivalry against Oklahoma is \"based on anger\".[62] Other teams have also been considered to be rivals of the Longhorns in various sports.[63][64][65][66] This list includes several other colleges in Texas, such as Texas Christian, Baylor, Rice,[67] Texas Tech,[68] and Houston.[69] Texas is also one of the biggest rivals of the University of Arkansas,[70] which may be attributed to their long tenure as the two eponymous state schools of the former Southwest Conference, or to the 1969 game between the two, which decided the national championship in favor of the Longhorns.[71][72] Texas has a long-standing, bitter rivalry with the University of Oklahoma. The football game between the University of Texas and Oklahoma is commonly known as the \"Red River Shootout\" and is held annually in Dallas, Texas, at the Cotton Bowl. This name has come to refer to the two schools' contests in other major team sports as well. Since 2005, the football game has received sponsorship dollars in return for being referred to as the \"SBC Red River Rivalry\"[73] (changed to AT&T Red River Rivalry in 2006 when SBC changed its corporate name to AT&T), a move which has been criticized both for its commercialism[74] and its political correctness.[75] In recent years,[when?] this rivalry has taken on added significance, since both football programs have been highly ranked and compete in the same division of the Big 12 conference. In 2005, The Dallas Morning News did an opinion poll of the 119 Division 1A football coaches as to the nations top rivalry game in college football. The Texas‚ÄìOklahoma game was ranked third.[76] The annual football game with Texas A&M usually took place on the weekend of Thanksgiving each year, though it was moved to the first weekend in December in 1994 due to A&M's TV restriction during probation. In either case, the Texas-Texas A&M game was the last regular-season contest for each team. The Longhorns lead the series, 76‚Äì37‚Äì5. In an attempt to generate more attention for the rivalry in sports other than football, in 2004 the two schools started the Lone Star Showdown,[77] which began as a two-year trial program and has continued ever since. Essentially, each time the two schools meet in a sport, the winner of the matchup gets a point. In sports wherein the teams meet twice one half point is awarded for a victory. If more contests than two occur, such as in baseball, the series winner gets one point. At the end of the year, the school with the most points wins the series and receives a trophy. In the event of a tie the current holder retains the trophy as did A&M after the '08‚Äì'09 season. Texas leads the series 6‚Äì2. Aspects of the rivalry include: With Texas A&M's move to the Southeastern Conference, the Lone Star Showdown's final game was played on November 24, 2011, at Kyle Field. The Longhorns won, 27‚Äì25, on a last-second field goal. The 2011 game marked the end of a 118-year Thanksgiving Day tradition. With the Longhorns set to join the Southeastern Conference no later than July 1, 2024, the rivalry will resume as a conference game. The Longhorns and Red Raiders football teams compete annually for a traveling trophy called the Chancellor's Spurs. The exchange began in 1996, and the Longhorns lead the football series, 55‚Äì18. A long-standing and historic rivalry with the Rice Owls, which has been largely dominated by Texas, has been played since 1914. The game is still played frequently, with Texas winning the latest matchup 37‚Äì10 (2023). The Owls most recent victory in the rivalry came in 1994 when they won 19‚Äì17 at Rice Stadium, they would also go on to win the Southwest Conference that year. There are currently no future games scheduled in the series.[87] Major sporting facilities and their main uses include: In addition, the University of Texas has numerous practice, training, and intramural facilities. The University of Texas many traditions which associated with athletics events, especially football. Some Longhorn traditions include: For nine straight years (2005‚Äì2013), Texas was listed as the number one Collegiate Licensing Company client in regards to the amount of annual trademark royalties received from the sales of its fan merchandise.[4] Schools that are not members of Collegiate Licensing Company however are not ranked in the listing.[94] Money from merchandising sales goes to the university, as opposed to being earmarked specifically for athletics programs.[4] On January 20, 2011, the UT athletic department announced plans to launch a 24-hour channel devoted entirely to UT sports and academic activities at the University of Texas.[95] This channel, a joint venture with ESPN, takes advantage of a clause in new Big 12 Conference television contracts allowing Texas a bigger share of revenues than the conference's other members; in turn, it was part of the agreement to keep the conference together amidst a full-scale plan by the Pac-10 Conference to raid Big 12 members. (The Pac-10 only gained one Big 12 school, Colorado). Both sides hoped to launch the channel for the 2011‚Äì2012 academic year, but needed carriage commitments first. Banners with the name \"ESPN Texas\" were visible during segments of SportsCenter and other programs originating from Sundance Square in Fort Worth, Texas in the week prior to Super Bowl XLV. The channel was launched in August 2011 as the Longhorn Network. Before its launch, the network had controversial plans to air high school football games, an institution throughout the state of Texas. Currently, the state's governing body for public high school sports, the University Interscholastic League, prohibits live game telecasts on Friday nights. It had also been speculated that any telecast on the new channel, regardless of when it aired, could violate NCAA rules against unfair recruiting inducements.[96] This was especially an issue for Texas A&M; in fact, the plans for the network to air high school games directly led to A&M's decision in July 2011 to leave the Big 12 for the SEC.[97] The Big 12 then approved a temporary rule in August 2011 banning the planned high school telecasts,[98] and within two weeks, the NCAA ruled that no school or conference network could broadcast high school games, ending that particular controversy.[99][100] The University of Texas is known to have a big group of powerful boosters that help support a third of the budget of the athletics department.[101] The main people known to be involved are:",

The game was played on December 31, 2024, with the Chicago Blackhawks hosting the St. Louis Blues at Wrigley Field in Chicago.[2] For the first time, two Winter Classics were held in the same calendar year, as the 2024 Winter Classic had been played on January 1, 2024. The Blues defeated the Blackhawks 6-2. The league announced the game on February 7, 2024, during the first intermission of the NHL on TNT's broadcast of the Tampa Bay Lightning‚ÄìNew York Rangers game.[2][3] Several media sources however leaked the game's site and opponents on the day before.[4][5][6] This was a rematch of the 2017 NHL Winter Classic, when the St. Louis Blues defeated the Chicago Blackhawks, 4‚àí1, at Busch Stadium in St. Louis. This was also Wrigley Field's second time hosting an NHL outdoor game, having previously hosted the 2009 NHL Winter Classic.[2] New Year's Eve was chosen as the date for the Winter Classic, as opposed to its traditional New Year's Day scheduling, in response to the expansion of the College Football Playoff from four teams to 12 beginning in the 2024‚Äì25 postseason. The Winter Classic had been on a steady decline in ratings, one exacerbated by the move to the cable-only TNT Sports in 2022, and the move to the less crowded slot on New Year's Eve afternoon (much of the game will take place in the gap between the 2024 Texas Bowl ending and the Fiesta Bowl's kickoff) was intended to make the event \"something (...) very unique on that day.\"[7] A moment of silence for former president of the United States Jimmy Carter who died two days earlier was held prior to the game. The American national anthem was performed by Blackhawks anthem singer Jim Cornelison, accompanied by organist Carrie Marcotte and American Sign Language performer Samantha Taplin. This is Cornelison's third time performing the national anthem at the Winter Classic, following 2009 and 2019. Chicago-based rapper Chance the Rapper performed during the first intermission. Chicago-based rock group The Smashing Pumpkins performed during the player introductions while lead singer Billy Corgan performed \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\". In the United States, broadcasting rights to the game are held by TNT, with sister channel TruTV simulcasting, and streaming on Max. In Canada, rights are held by Sportsnet with streaming on Sportsnet+.",

                "content": "The Baylor Bears football team represents Baylor University in Division I FBS college football. They are a member of the Big 12 Conference. After 64 seasons at the off-campus Baylor Stadium, renamed Floyd Casey Stadium in 1988, the Bears opened the new on-campus McLane Stadium for the 2014 season. Baylor University's football team has seen a wide variation in its success through the years, including an undefeated 3‚Äì0 perfect record in 1900. Initially, starting in the year 1898, the university played its home games on an unnamed field near the university campus. Beginning in 1905, the team's home games were played at Carroll Field, between the Carroll Science Building and Waco Creek. Baylor did not adopt a mascot (the Baylor Bears) until December 14, 1914 after the completion of the 1914 football season. Additionally, Baylor did not join an athletic conference until 1914 after the conclusion of the football season, when it became a founding member of the Southwest Conference. Baylor played its first home game against Toby's Business College (located in Waco) in 1899, its first away game on 4 November 1900, at Austin College, and its first neutral-site game against Texas A&M in 1901. For the 1899 and 1900 seasons, the team was coached by R.H. Hamilton, whose 5‚Äì1‚Äì1 record was distinguished with never having a losing record; in 1899, Baylor played, and lost, its first game against Texas A&M, which would become a rivalry (until 2012 when Texas A&M changed conferences), the Battle of the Brazos, with over 100 games played in the series by 2003. W.J. Ritchie coached the 1901 team, leading it to a 5‚Äì3 record; in this year, the first games of the Baylor-Texas and Baylor-TCU series were played. Texas Christian University (known as AddRan Male & Female College until 1902) was located in Waco from 1895 to 1910 and was one of Baylor's greatest football rivals until the dissolution of the Southwest Conference in 1995. The 1901 season also welcomed Baylor's first Thanksgiving Day football game, with a 28‚Äì0 win over St. Edward's University. J.C. Ewing took control of the team in 1902, and led it to its first losing season, with a 3‚Äì4‚Äì2 record. R.N. Watts restored Baylor's winning tradition in 1903, with a record of 4‚Äì3‚Äì1. No team was fielded in 1906 following a ban opposing the violence of football; along with 1943 and 1944 (during World War II), 1906 is one of three seasons since 1899 that Baylor has not competed in varsity football. Luther Burleson headed the restored football team in 1907, and managed a 4‚Äì3‚Äì1 record. E.J. Mills led the team for the 1908 and 1909 seasons; their 3‚Äì5‚Äì0 and 5‚Äì3‚Äì0 records were notable for the 1908 loss to LSU, and for the world's first \"Homecoming\" at the 1909 Thanksgiving Day game, which included a concert, parade, and bonfire. To this day, Baylor claims the honor of having the largest homecoming parade in the world. Baylor has many traditions such as the Baylor-TCU rivalry game which is one of the most played in all of college football, the Battle of the Brazos (through 2011 when Texas A&M left the Big 12), membership in the historic Southwest Conference, a live bear mascot since 1915 and the Baylor Line. In 1966, John Hill Westbrook of Elgin, Texas became the first African American to play varsity football in the Southwest Conference when he joined the Baylor team. Baylor won the SWC Championship in 1915, 1916, 1922 and again in 1924. In 1956 Baylor came close to the SWC title again but finished second and was sent to face the undefeated No. 2 Tennessee Volunteers in the 1957 Sugar Bowl. Baylor defeated Johnny Majors and the No. 2 Volunteers 13‚Äì7. This was the highest ranked opponent Baylor had ever defeated until defeating No. 1 ranked Kansas State in 2012. The 1924 SWC Championship would be the last for many decades until Baylor won the conference again in 1974 under the leadership of third year head coach Grant Teaff. From the late 1940s until the mid-1960s, Baylor also played in the 1952 Orange Bowl (vs. Georgia Tech), twice in the Gator Bowl (vs. Auburn and Florida), and the Bluebonnet (beating LSU), Dixie (beating Wake Forest) and Gotham Bowl (beating No. 10 ranked Utah St in New York City). Baylor had finished in last place in 4 of the last 7 seasons including the year before and had not won the conference championship in 50 years. Also, prior to this season, they had never appeared in the Cotton Bowl. Furthermore, coming into the 1974 season Baylor had lost 16 consecutive games to the Texas Longhorns. The 1974 Texas vs Baylor game looked like another easy win for Texas as the Longhorns took quick control of the game and went into halftime leading 24‚Äì7. Baylor was energized starting the 2nd half however, sparked by a blocked punt early in the 3rd quarter. The Bears rallied to a thrilling 34‚Äì24 victory over the Longhorns. Baylor went on to win the conference title that year and a first ever trip to the Cotton Bowl (the first time in seven seasons that Texas did not win the Southwest Conference title). The entire 1974 Baylor football season was dubbed the \"Miracle on the Brazos\" by many sports writers at the time. The win over Texas and the SWC championship have thus become a special part of Baylor's athletic history. One of the most successful coaches in Baylor football history was Grant Teaff. He led the Bears to conference titles in 1974, his third year in the program, and again in 1980 when he led the Bears to the Cotton Bowl to face the Alabama Crimson Tide. Grant Teaff recruited famous players such as Mike Singletary, Thomas Everett, Walter Abercrombie and James Francis to play football at Baylor University. Teaff was also named National Coach of the Year after the 1974 season. He would go on to serve until 1992 leading Baylor to eight bowl games as well as the aforementioned Southwest Conference championships (1974, 1980) in his 21 years as head coach. Chuck Reedy was coach for four seasons and compiled a record of 23‚Äì22. His 1994 team was part of a 5-way co-championship of the Southwest Conference, though an ineligible Texas A&M held a better conference record. In 1996 Baylor joined Texas, Texas Tech, and Texas A&M, along with the Big 8 conference schools, to form the Big 12 Conference. Baylor was led by a succession of coaches with mediocre results. Dave Roberts was coach from 1997 to 1998 and compiled a 4‚Äì18 record. Kevin Steele followed from 1999 to 2002 and posted a 9‚Äì36 record. He was succeeded by Guy Morriss from 2003 to 2007 who compiled an 18‚Äì40 record. The 2010 season was a breakthrough for the Baylor Bears. Baylor earned an invitation to the Texas Bowl in Houston after finishing the regular season with a 7‚Äì5 record, this was their first bowl appearance since 1995. In the regular season the Bears victories included Big 12 conference wins over Kansas and Kansas St, as well as road wins over Colorado and Texas. Building on the success of the 2010 team, Baylor began the 2011 season at home with an upset of No. 14 TCU, winners of the previous season's Rose Bowl. The Bears also won their next two games before traveling to Kansas State where they lost a tightly contested game by a single point. Baylor then defeated Iowa State 49‚Äì26 for the first conference win of the year before finishing October by losing two straight on the road, to A&M and eventual conference champion No. 3 Oklahoma State. The Bears rebounded to finish the regular season, with five straight victories including a Homecoming win over Missouri, a 31‚Äì30 overtime victory at Kansas in which Baylor tied a school record by overcoming a 21-point deficit in the 4th quarter, and the program's first win over No. 5 Oklahoma on a 34-yard touchdown pass from Griffin to Terrance Williams with 8 seconds remaining in the game. Baylor concluded November in Dallas playing against Texas Tech in Cowboys Stadium; although Griffin left the game due to a concussion at the half, backup Nick Florence entered the game and led the Bears to a 66‚Äì42 victory. The Bears finished the regular season at home with a 48‚Äì24 victory over No. 22 Texas that propelled the team (9‚Äì3, 6‚Äì3 Big XII) to the Alamo Bowl with No. 12 and No. 15 BCS and AP rankings respectively, and propelled Griffin to the top of the Heisman Trophy voting; he became the first Baylor player to win the award and the first Baylor player since Don Trull in 1963 to factor significantly in the voting. In the Alamo Bowl, the Bears faced the Washington Huskies in what became the second-highest scoring bowl game in history, and the highest-scoring regulation bowl game ever. Baylor went up 21‚Äì7 early in the game, with Griffin throwing for one touchdown and rushing for another. The Huskies roared back with 28 unanswered points, and the teams finished the half with Washington leading 35‚Äì24. In the second half, with the defenses showing limited ability to cope with the high-powered offenses led by Griffin and Husky QB Keith Price, the teams traded scores. The Bears overcame the halftime deficit, going ahead for good 60‚Äì56 halfway in the 4th quarter, and Baylor RB Terrance Ganaway tacked on a final 43-yard touchdown run. Ganaway finished with 21 carries for 200 yards and 5 TDs and was recognized as the game's offensive MVP. Baylor's 2012 season opened in Waco against the SMU Mustangs. Quarterback Nick Florence ‚Äì now a senior, having burned his redshirt season to play the second half against Texas Tech in 2011 after Griffin III left with a concussion ‚Äì led the Bears to a 59‚Äì24 victory. Two weeks later, a victory at home against No. 2 FCS Sam Houston State gave Baylor fans their first glimpse of things to come when Oregon transfer running back Lache Seastrunk, who entered the game in the 4th quarter, put Baylor ahead 41‚Äì23 with a 15-yard touchdown rush. Baylor then traveled to Louisiana-Monroe to face a Warhawk team which had notched a stunning victory over No. 8 Arkansas and had subsequently taken Auburn to overtime. A 47‚Äì42 Baylor victory represented the Bears' 9th consecutive win (at the time, the 2nd longest streak in the FBS) and gave the Bears a No. 24 ranking. The win streak was broken during Baylor's first trip to Morgantown, West Virginia, by a No. 7 ranked Mountaineer team playing their inaugural Big 12 conference game. The 70‚Äì63 shootout saw several Big 12 records set, notably including the single-game receiving record by Baylor receiver Terrance Williams (314 yards). The loss dropped Baylor from the rankings and represented the start of a 4-game skid during which time Baylor lost in Waco to TCU, at No. 25 Texas, and at Iowa State. A win at home against Kansas and a loss at No. 12 Oklahoma left the Bears fighting for bowl eligibility. Baylor shocked the college football world the next week by soundly beating No. 1 Kansas State in Waco 52‚Äì24. A 12-yard Florence touchdown rush in the first quarter gave Baylor a 14‚Äì7 lead which was never relinquished. The Baylor defense highlighted the game with a stout goal-line stand in the 4th quarter and intercepted Heisman hopeful Collin Klein three times, the last in the endzone to set up an 80-yard touchdown run by Lache Seastrunk. The victory over Kansas State represented the program's first ever win over a No. 1 ranked team and sparked a 3-game win streak for Baylor (with a 52‚Äì45 overtime victory over Texas Tech in Cowboys Stadium and a 41‚Äì34 victory in Waco over No. 23 Oklahoma State). During the OSU game Seastrunk again achieved recognition for a 76-yard touchdown rush, outrunning the Oklahoma State secondary despite suffering a quadriceps cramp near midfield. The conclusion of Baylor's 7‚Äì5 2012 campaign marked the first time since 1949‚Äì51 that the Bears have enjoyed three consecutive seasons with 7+ wins. On December 2, Baylor accepted a berth in the Holiday Bowl, sending the Bears to a third consecutive bowl for the first time in program history. Baylor easily defeated the No. 17-ranked UCLA Bruins in the Holiday Bowl on December 27, 2012 by a final margin of 49‚Äì26 after jumping out to a 21‚Äì0 lead early in the 2nd quarter. Lache Seastrunk (RB) and Chris McAllister (DE) were named Offensive Player and Defensive Player of the game respectively. In 2013, Baylor had arguably its best regular season in school history. A best-ever 9‚Äì0 start propelled the Bears to a No. 3 national ranking in the AP Poll. However, after an on-the-road loss to Oklahoma State, the Bears needed victories in their last two games and an Oklahoma State loss to have an opportunity to clinch the outright Big 12 title. With the Cowboys' loss, Baylor's season-closing game against Texas ‚Äî the final game at Floyd Casey Stadium ‚Äî became a de facto Big 12 championship game. Baylor defeated the Longhorns, 30‚Äì10, to notch a school-record 11th win and its first outright conference title since 1980. It also assured the team a Fiesta Bowl berth, the Bears' first-ever BCS bowl appearance and their first major bowl in 33 years. Baylor was defeated in the Fiesta Bowl by the University of Central Florida 52‚Äì42.[3] Bryce Petty, the Bears' quarterback, placed 7th in the overall 2013‚Äì14 Heisman race in New York, the second Heisman Trophy candidate set forth by Baylor in the last three record-breaking seasons. Petty was voted Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year following the season.[citation needed] From 2012 to 2016, Baylor was rocked by a sexual assault scandal which resulted in the dismissal of head coach Art Briles, as well as the resignations of Athletic Director Ian McCaw, the University President Kenneth Starr, and the Title IX coordinator Patty Crawford. The Big 12 Conference conditionally withheld $6 million from Baylor's yearly payout until Baylor could certify changes were implemented.[4] In March 2017, the Texas Ranger Division confirmed that it had begun a \"preliminary investigation\" into whether or not the university or Waco PD had broken any laws.[4] On March 7, 2017, U.S. District Judge Robert L. Pitman dismissed several claims made in a lawsuit against the university while allowing others to proceed.[4] Jim Grobe took over as interim head coach for Baylor and led them to their 7th straight bowl appearance and a 31-12 victory over highly favored Boise State (10-2 record) at the Cactus Bowl in Arizona. Baylor finished the season with a 7-6 record. In December 2016 former Temple coach, Matt Rhule, was hired as the head Baylor football coach and given a 7 year contract.[5] Rhule subsequently replaced all of the prior football coaches and support staff and completed the hiring process in February 2017.[6] Coach Rhule and the Bears suffered through a disastrous first season in 2017, finishing the year with a 1-11 record. A 38-9 victory on the road in week 10 over the Kansas Jayhawks was the lone win. The rest of the season was sprinkled with some positives, including a close loss vs No. 3 Oklahoma (49-41) and a 2 point loss to No. 23 West Virginia (38-36). In 2018 Coach Rhule led the Baylor Bears to one of the nations biggest 1 year turnaround seasons, going from 1 win to 7 wins after a thrilling Texas Bowl victory over Vanderbilt (45-38). Baylor finished the year with a 7-6 record but was close to having a very good season as 4 losses came on the road to top 20 competition (No. 6, No. 9, No. 13, No. 20). The 2019 season will go down as one of the best ever in Baylor football history. The Bears finished the regular season T-1st in the Big 12 with an 11-1 record, matching the program record for wins. The Bears played Oklahoma in the Big 12 Championship game but lost in a close, hard fought game. To finish the season, Baylor was ranked No. 7 in the CFP poll and was selected to play the No. 5 Georgia Bulldogs in the Sugar Bowl. They lost this game by a score of 14-26. On January 7, 2020, Rhule was hired as the head coach of the Carolina Panthers of the NFL, leaving Baylor after completely turning around the football program and its national perception. In January 2020, after Rhule's departure for the Panthers, Baylor hired former LSU defensive coordinator Dave Aranda.[7] In Aranda's first season, the team compiled a 2‚Äì7 record, with wins against Kansas (0‚Äì9) and Kansas State (4‚Äì6). On December 4, 2021, Baylor held off an Oklahoma State rally to win the Big 12 Championship Game 21-16. Coach Dave Aranda took responsibility for a controversial decision to go for the first down on a 4th-and-1 at their own 36. The failed conversion triggered the Oklahoma State rally. However, Coach Aranda owned up to the call in a post-game interview, explaining that Baylor Football is about seizing opportunities when they are available; an attitude that ultimately won them the game. Oklahoma State had the ball at the Baylor 2-yard line with 1:19 to go. Baylor stopped them on 3 runs and a pass for one of the all-time great goal-line stands. Baylor has been independent and a member of two different conferences.[citation needed] Baylor has won ten conference championships, won in two different conferences, six outright and four shared.[8][9] ‚Ä† Co-championship Baylor has played in 28 bowl games, garnering a record of 14‚Äì14. Baylor has appeared in 8 New Year's Day bowl games and 8 major bowl games.[10] ‚Ä† New Year's Six bowl game Baylor's rivalry with Houston stems from their days playing each other in the old Southwest Conference, and the aftermath of its dissolution with many Houston fans feeling that inside politics is what kept them out of the inaugural Big 12.[11] The two played each other for 20 years from 1976 to 1995, and Baylor currently leads the series 15‚Äì14‚Äì1 following their recent encounter in the 2024 season.[12] Baylor's rivalry with TCU is one of the oldest and most played in all of college football. Dating back to 1899 the series began while TCU was located in Waco, Texas as a cross-town rival to Baylor. Due to the close proximity of the two schools 23 games were played between 1899 and 1910. A fire in 1910 destroyed the Main Building on the TCU campus and financial incentives from the city of Fort Worth convinced the Board of Trustees to relocate TCU to that city. There was a ten-year break in the series when the dissolution of the Southwest Conference in 1996 resulted in the two universities joining separate athletic conferences. The series resumed in Waco for Baylor's 2006 home opener and continued in 2007 in Fort Worth. TCU leads the series 59‚Äì54‚Äì7 through the conclusion of the 2024 season.[13] In November 2023, the official name of the rivalry was changed to the \"Bluebonnet Battle\" to commemorate the rivalry becoming the longest-played rivalry in Texas.[14] Baylor and Texas have played each other 113 times, with the first game between Baylor and Texas being played in 1901. Only Oklahoma and Texas A&M have played Texas more times than Baylor. Both Baylor and Texas were founding members of the Southwest Conference and the Big 12 Conference. Texas leads the series with Baylor 81‚Äì28‚Äì4. However, starting in 2010 this rivalry intensified as Baylor established themselves as a major contender in the Big 12 Conference with Baylor playing for 4 Big 12 titles and winning 3, including a head-to-head win over Texas to clinch the Big 12 Championship in 2013, in what is now known as the \"Ice Bowl\".[15] Baylor's 30‚Äì10 win over the Longhorns was Mack Brown's last regular season game as the head coach at Texas. With Texas departing the Big 12 to join the Southeastern Conference (SEC) in 2024, the future of the rivalry is uncertain beyond 2023.[16][17][18] Since 2010, the Baylor vs Texas series is led by Texas 8‚Äì6.[19] The Baylor Bears are Texas Tech's most played opponent with 80 meetings between the teams dating back to 1929. From 2009-2018, the Bears played the Red Raiders at AT&T Stadium during the Saturday after Thanksgiving (with the exception of the 2010 game which was played at the Cotton Bowl during the State Fair of Texas). Starting with the 2019 season, the series moved back to the two schools respective on campus stadiums with Baylor hosting in Waco in 2019 and Texas Tech hosting in Lubbock in 2020. As of the conclusion of the 2022 season, Baylor leads the overall series 42‚Äì40‚Äì1.[20] Texas A&M is one of Baylor's oldest rivals as the series dates from 1899 and the two schools are located only 90 miles apart on the Brazos River. The competitive peak of the series was from 1960‚Äì1990 when Baylor won 13 games, A&M won 16 games and 2 games ended in ties. During that time 18 games were decided by 7 points or fewer. The game played in 2011 is likely the end of the series for the foreseeable future given A&M's decision to leave the Big 12 Conference. Texas A&M leads the series 68‚Äì31‚Äì9 with the most recent game played in 2011.[21] The Baylor Bears had played their home games at Floyd Casey Stadium, originally known as Baylor Stadium, since the facility opened in 1950 till closure in 2013. Construction began on what would become Floyd Casey Stadium right after World War II in 1948. The stadium cost $1.8 million to construct and was placed on land donated by a local Baylor landowner. It opened under the name Baylor Stadium in 1950 with a game against Houston, won by Baylor 34‚Äì7. When finished the new stadium was the second largest football stadium in the state of Texas.[citation needed] Floyd Casey Stadium had a seating capacity of 50,000 and had undergone multiple renovations during its lifetime, most recently in 2009. Prior to the Bears time at Floyd Casey Stadium, the Bears played at Municipal Stadium (1936‚Äì1949), Cotton Palace (1926‚Äì1929), on campus at Carroll Field (1906‚Äì1925 and 1930‚Äì1935). As of the 2012 season Carroll Field has been the only on-campus homefield for the Bears. In the Fall of 2012, Baylor University began construction of a new $266 million stadium on the north bank of the Brazos River. The stadium opened for the 2014 football season with the first game taking place on August 31, 2014 against former Southwest Conference rival Southern Methodist University (SMU).[22] The new McLane Stadium was named after Drayton McLane, Jr. who donated a significant amount of money toward the stadium's construction. McLane Stadium is the largest construction project in the history of Waco and Central Texas, and has brought increased revenue to the downtown Waco area. Although McLane Stadium is smaller in capacity than its predecessor, Floyd Casey Stadium, it is expandable to up to 55,000 seats.[citation needed] The Simpson Center was built in 2009 and provides a 97,000 foot facility to house football operations. The building also houses the 13,500 foot football weight room. The building is built in a classic collegiate style matching the red brick southern architectural style of the Baylor University campus and is over three stories tall. It houses the main athletic training room, football team locker room, equipment room, coach's locker room, and a large primary weight room. The Simpson Center also houses academic support rooms for studying and academic work. Equipment for sports and athletic rehabilitation include the new state of the art underwater treadmills built into the Simpson Center.[citation needed] The indoor practice facility is a full football field and A/C building that allows Baylor athletics to practice in all weather conditions year round. The Indoor facility was a gift from longtime Baylor letterwinner and successful businessman Jay Allison along with his wife Jenny. The new state of the art indoor field was designed to be a part of the Highers Athletic Complex and backs up to the Brazos river. The building was built in 2010 for an estimated cost of $15.4 million.[citation needed] The Bears have finished in the final season rankings of the AP Poll or Coaches Poll 18 times. The AP Poll first appeared in 1934, and has been published continuously since 1936. The Coaches Poll began its ranking with 20 teams in 1950‚Äì51 season, but expanded to 25 teams beginning in the 1990‚Äì91 season.[23] The College Football Playoff rankings were used from 2014-23 for a four-team knockout tournament to determine a national champion; a 12-team playoff is planned beginning in 2024. A total of two Baylor coaches and eight Baylor players have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame to date. Baylor has had four Heisman Trophy candidates, an award given to the best player in college football, with one candidate winning the trophy. The Baylor Line is one of the first aspects of Baylor spirit to which freshmen are introduced. The 'Baylor Line' is made entirely of freshmen and is the core of Baylor spirit and tradition. Students wear a gold football jersey with the number of their expected graduation year and a chosen nickname on the back. Before each football game the Baylor Line gathers at one end of McLane Stadium and waits for the signal to make a 'mad dash' down the field to create a giant human tunnel through which the football team runs through to enter the stadium. Six members of the Baylor Line carry flags with the letters B-A-Y-L-O-R while the rest of the Line runs behind them. Afterwards students rush the sidelines and stand in an exclusive Baylor Line section behind the opponents' bench where students watch the game, cheer the Bears to another victory, and heckle the opposing team. It began as an all-male organization until 1993, when women were allowed to join. At its inception the Baylor Line was a group of freshmen men who lined the front of Baylor's student section for the express purpose of protecting Baylor women from the other teams more violent fans. The jersey colors of the Line were originally rotated between green in odd numbered years and gold in even numbered years through 1998 (class of 2002). This changed to green every year until around 2001, when in the interest of having a more substantial looking student section the decision was made to use gold every year. The green jerseys are now used for members of the Baylor University Chamber of Commerce who lead the Baylor Line in chants; these jerseys have \"CC\" on the back instead of a graduation year. Baylor keeps two American black bears, Indy and Belle, on campus in their natural habitat enclosure as mascots for the University. American black bears roamed the majority of Texas in considerable abundance when Baylor was founded in 1845, and bears could still be found throughout many areas of the state until the 1940s. The university has had live bears since 1915. The first live bear was a gift from Herbert Mayr, a local businessman who won the bear in a poker game from a member of the troops of the 107th Engineers, which was a unit of the 32nd Infantry Division stationed at Camp MacArthur in Waco. The soldiers were based in the city during World War I. The Bears are brought to the stadium by the Baylor Chamber spirit group on game days and they attend pre-game events and stay to be the living symbol of the University at the games. However, since 2010 the bears are no longer allowed at football games or other campus events on leashes. The USDA informed Baylor officials that they would no longer be permitted to bring the bears to games per Federal Code of Regulations 2.131(c)(1)which states \"During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of the animals and the public.\" Before kickoff and after each games conclusion Baylor fans sing the University alma mater 'That Good Old Baylor Line' while holding their \"Bear claws\"[24] in the air. The tune is set to the 1949 classic \"In the Good Old Summertime.\" The traditional Baylor uniform worn for home games consists of a gold helmet with a green interlocking BU logo on the sides and green & white stripes down the middle, green jersey, and white or gold pants; a white jersey is substituted for the green one for road games. In recent seasons, both a matte green helmet and a white helmet have been used as alternates to the gold helmet. Black jerseys as well as black or green pants have also been used giving the Bears multiple uniform combinations to choose from. On August 11, 2014, the Baylor Bears won the online fan vote for college football's best uniform awarded by Sporting News Magazine. In 2019, Baylor university updated their athletic marks across all sports, including football. This included an updated primary interlocking \"BU\" logo, as well as a new proprietary number font and alternate bear head logo. The football uniforms were updated with the new font for the numbers, primary logo on the helmet, and an inclusion of the bear head logo on the collar. As of October 18, 2021, 12 former Baylor players were listed on NFL rosters:[25] Announced schedules as of May 17, 2024.[26] Seifried, C.S., Demiris, T., & Petersen, J. (2021).

                "content": "Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve (NYRE), billed since 2008 as Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest, is a New Year's Eve television special broadcast by ABC. The special broadcasts primarily from New York City's Times Square and prominently features coverage of its annual ball drop event hosted by television personality Ryan Seacrest, along with live and pre-recorded musical performances by popular musicians from Times Square and Hollywood. Since 2016‚Äì17, the special has regularly included performances and coverage of midnight festivities from other U.S. locations, including New Orleans (Central Time, from 2017‚Äì2024) and San Juan (Atlantic Time, from 2021‚Äì2022). Its creator and namesake was the entertainer Dick Clark, who conceived New Year's Rockin' Eve as a youthful competitor to Guy Lombardo's popular and long-running New Year's Eve specials on CBS. The special first aired on December 31, 1972; its first two editions were broadcast by NBC, and hosted by Three Dog Night and George Carlin, respectively, with Clark anchoring coverage from Times Square. In 1974‚Äì75, the program moved to its current home of ABC, and Clark assumed the role of host. Since 2000‚Äì01, the special has broadcast segments in prime time alongside the main late-night broadcast; initially occupying the 10:00 p.m. ET/PT hour, from 2011‚Äì12 onward the special has occupied the entirety of ABC's primetime and late-night schedule on New Year's Eve. Following the death of Guy Lombardo on November 5, 1977 and the decline of CBS's specials, New Year's Rockin' Eve grew in popularity and became the dominant New Year's special on U.S. television. New Year's Rockin' Eve has consistently remained the highest-rated New Year's Eve special broadcast by the United States' major television networks; its 2012 edition peaked at 22.6 million home viewers‚Äînot including viewers watching from public locations, which were not yet measured by Nielsen at the time.[1][2][3] The series has most recently been renewed through at least 2028‚Äì29.[4] Dick Clark hosted New Year's Rockin' Eve annually from 1973 through 1999 and from 2001 through 2004. For 2000, Clark participated in ABC News' day-long ABC 2000 Today telecast, joining overall host Peter Jennings for coverage from Times Square. In December 2004, Clark suffered a stroke, which resulted in Regis Philbin serving as guest host. Due to lingering speech impediments from the stroke, Clark ceded hosting duties to Ryan Seacrest the following year, but he continued to make limited appearances as a co-host until his death on April 18, 2012. Hosting solo since the 2012‚Äì13 edition, Seacrest was joined for the 2023‚Äì24 edition by Rita Ora as co-host and correspondent from Times Square, and Jeannie Mai as host of the Los Angeles-based concert segments. New Year's Rockin' Eve is primarily broadcast from Times Square in New York City, providing coverage of the New Year's Eve festivities held there, and culminating with the long-running ball drop approaching midnight. The lead-up to the program features performances by popular musicians; some of these performances (particularly headlining acts) originate live from a stage in Times Square, but the majority of the performances are presented via segments (billed as the \"Billboard Hollywood Party\") recorded in Los Angeles.[5] Since 2005, Ryan Seacrest has hosted the live show outside in Times Square, joined by a celebrity correspondent providing additional reports from attendees. From his return and until his death, Dick Clark hosted a limited number of segments from Times Square Studios throughout the broadcast, including the countdown. Clark carried on with his tradition of kissing his wife, Kari Wigton, at midnight.[2][6] Since the 2000‚Äì01 edition, the special has begun with a segment in prime time, which was initially branded as Dick Clark's Primetime New Year's Rockin' Eve, and is currently billed for ratings purposes as \"Primetme ‚Äì Part 1\". Initially airing at 10:00 p.m. ET/PT, the prime time block was extended to 8:00 p.m. (\"Part I\", with the remaining primetime block billed as \"Part II\") beginning with the 2011‚Äì12 edition. From 2011‚Äì12 to 2013‚Äì14, \"Part I\" primarily featured retrospective countdowns drawing from the Dick Clark Productions library, including the top New Year's Rockin' Eve performances of all-time (in honor of the special's 40th anniversary), and the top women in music.[2][7] Following a break for late local programming (such as late-night newscasts), the second block of the program is broadcast, which begins at 10:30 p.m. ET/PT (previously at 11:30 p.m. until 2021‚Äì22), and features coverage of midnight celebrations in the Atlantic Time Zone from the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico at 10:59 p.m. ET and in the Eastern Time Zone from the Times Square ball drop at 11:59 p.m. ET. Until the addition of the prime time block, this segment served as the main block (and from 1997‚Äì98 onward, \"Part I\") of the entire Rockin' Eve telecast. From 2016‚Äì17 through 2022‚Äì23, the late-night block also featured coverage from the Jackson Square fleur-de-lis drop in New Orleans at 12:59 a.m. ET.[8][9][10] After the conclusion of live coverage, the show continues into its final block, which features the remainder of the pre-recorded concert segments. Debuting with the 1997‚Äì98 edition, the secondary late-night segment runs up to approximately 2:10 a.m. ET/PT, and has lasted as late as 3:00 a.m. ET/PT in the past.[11][12][13] For the first time, the late-night block for the 2024‚Äì25 edition will add a live broadcast of celebrations in the Pacific Time Zone, originating from the Las Vegas Strip.[14] Prior to the premiere of New Year's Rockin' Eve, the most well-known New Year's Eve program was the annual big band remote of bandleader Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians, broadcast from the ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Guy Lombardo hosted 48 straight New Year's Eve broadcasts on CBS until his death in 1977, beginning on radio in 1928 (and for a period, splitting with NBC Radio following midnight ET), and on CBS Television from 1956 to 1976 (which also featured coverage of the ball drop in Times Square). Lombardo was also well known for his band's performance of the song \"Auld Lang Syne\" at midnight, which helped make the standard synonymous with the New Year's holiday in North America.[15][16][17] At the time, Dick Clark was well known as the host of American Bandstand, a music program produced from the studios of Philadelphia television station WFIL-TV (now WPVI-TV, which became an ABC owned-and-operated station in 1985 after its parent Capital Cities Communications purchased the network) and broadcast by ABC (which itself aired a New Year's Eve special on December 31, 1959).[18] In the 1970s, Clark felt that Guy Lombardo's New Year's specials were outdated and did not appeal well to younger viewers; he believed that only older viewers would be interested in big band music accompanied by \"people dancing cheek-to-jowl in their tuxedos and funny hats\".[17] In response, he decided to produce a more youthful New Year's Eve special of his own to compete. Clark's new program would be known as New Year's Rockin' Eve, a name chosen to signify the major contrast between his special and the more formal atmosphere of Guy Lombardo's special. The first edition, Three Dog Night's New Year's Rockin' Eve, was aired by NBC on December 31, 1972, and was hosted by the members of the rock band Three Dog Night. The special featured pre-recorded musical performances from the ballroom of the Queen Mary in Long Beach, California by Helen Reddy, Billy Preston, and Three Dog Night. Clark served as a reporter from Times Square for live coverage of the ball drop and arrival of 1973.[17][18][19][20] The second special, New Year's Rockin' Eve '74, also on NBC, was hosted by comedian George Carlin and featured pre-recorded musical performances by The Pointer Sisters, Billy Preston, Linda Ronstadt and Tower of Power once again from the Queen Mary ballroom.[21] Beginning with the 1974 edition, the program moved to ABC and Clark assumed hosting duties;[2][18][22] billed as Chicago's New Year's Rockin' Eve 1975 and seen as part of ABC's Wide World of Entertainment late-night block, the first ABC edition was headlined by the rock band Chicago, with guests The Beach Boys, The Doobie Brothers, Herbie Hancock and Olivia Newton-John, in segments pre-recorded at MGM Studios in Hollywood.[23] Following Guy Lombardo's death in 1977, CBS and the Royal Canadians attempted to continue their New Year's Eve broadcasts from the Waldorf-Astoria for 1977‚Äì78. However, the effects of Lombardo's absence led to a decline in viewership, allowing New Year's Rockin' Eve to overtake the Royal Canadians in viewership in only its sixth year on-air. The threat of the new special also prompted CBS to drop the Royal Canadians entirely in 1979 in favor of a new special, Happy New Year, America, which premiered for New Year's Eve 1979‚Äì80. With its recent success, Clark began hoping that New Year's Rockin' Eve would become a television tradition of its own, lamenting that \"Lombardo would always win [in New York] because of the Waldorf and 35 years of tradition, but we finally got it wrested.\" Clark's hopes soon became reality, as New Year's Rockin' Eve had displaced Guy Lombardo as the most popular and most-watched New Year's Eve special on American television in the years following.[2][18][22] The 1980 edition was co-hosted by Erin Moran and John Schneider of Happy Days and The Dukes of Hazzard respectively, and continued with Clark's goal to showcase acts that represented the previous year by featuring Barry Manilow, Blondie, Chic, The Oak Ridge Boys, and the Village People as performers.[24] The 1988 edition was co-hosted by China Beach cast members Marg Helgenberger and Brian Wimmer from the Cocoanut Grove club at the Ambassador Hotel.[25] In 1990, New Year's Eve fell on a Monday; on that night, ABC was scheduled to broadcast a Monday Night Football game between the Los Angeles Rams and the New Orleans Saints. Fearing that his special would not be able to start on time (as ABC usually began its Monday Night Football coverage at the time at 9:00 p.m. ET, which regularly delayed local and network late-night programming), Clark asked ABC to move the game's start time one hour early to 8:00 p.m., so that Rockin' Eve would run at its normal time. Mark Curry and Holly Robinson of the ABC sitcom Hangin' with Mr. Cooper co-hosted for 1993‚Äì94, with segments at Walt Disney World featuring performances by acts such as Brooks and Dunn and Kiss, along with the marriage of two California firefighters, Laura Turpin and Bob Hutnyan.[26] The 1994‚Äì95 edition was co-hosted with Margaret Cho and Steve Harvey (then respectively starring in the ABC sitcoms All-American Girl and Me and the Boys, both of which would be cancelled by the end of that television season), and included musical performances from Melissa Etheridge, Hootie & the Blowfish and Salt-N-Pepa.[27] The 1996‚Äì97 edition was co-hosted by Stacey Dash and Donald Faison of the ABC comedy series Clueless, and included performances by Jann Arden, Kiss, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, The Presidents of the United States of America, and The Tony Rich Project.[28] This edition also marked the 25th anniversary of New Year's Rockin' Eve; Clark marked this accomplishment by discussing the greatest challenges he had faced hosting the special, including being unable to hear his director over the loud crowds in Times Square, harsh weather conditions, and a year where the emcee had to contend with a group of 30 nude attendees in the background. Clark aimed to continue hosting the special through the year 2000.[29] Ultimately, Clark hosted the program nearly uninterrupted through 2004.[2][18][22] The late-night portion of the 1997‚Äì98 edition was followed by a second, hour-long special at 1:05 a.m., After New Year's Eve (later rebranded as merely an extension of the main broadcast), which was hosted by David Sanborn and featured Boz Scaggs, Isaac Hayes, Dr. John, Joan Osborne, Lou Reed, and Naughty by Nature.[30] Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve was canceled for the year 2000 due to ABC News presenting ABC 2000 Today, a day-long telecast hosted by Peter Jennings which, as part of a consortium of broadcasters, presented coverage of international and U.S. festivities celebrating the arrival of the year 2000. Clark joined Jennings and ABC News reporter Jack Ford as correspondents for coverage from Times Square. They were among the key members of the team of more than 1,000 members of the ABC News division in New York, London, and elsewhere around the world that were part of the broadcast, which also included correspondents/anchors Charles Gibson, Diane Sawyer, Barbara Walters, and Sam Donaldson and London Bureau chief Rex Granum.[31] They were all under the direction of ABC's Roger Goodman.[32] The ABC 2000 Today telecast overall also received a Peabody Award.[33] Reflecting on the event, Clark was enthusiastic about his participation, feeling that New Year's Eve 1999-2000 was one of the biggest nights he had ever spent in Times Square.[11] New Year's Rockin' Eve returned to ABC the following New Year's Eve for the arrival of 2001. The 2000‚Äì01 edition also introduced a new primetime hour at 10:00 p.m. ET/PT, which featured additional segments and music performances to lead into the main program. Clark felt positive about the program's expansion into primetime ‚Äì believing that viewers, no matter where they were, wanted to know what was going on in Times Square on New Year's Eve. Clark was joined by Fox & Friends anchor Steve Doocy, and Madison Michelle as reporters in Times Square. Comedian Wayne Brady hosted concert segments in Hollywood, which included performances by 98 Degrees, Baha Men, Boyz II Men, Lonestar, and Third Eye Blind among others.[11] The 2002 edition of New Year's Rockin' Eve, its 29th edition, featured pre-recorded concert performances from tours by Aerosmith, Destiny's Child, and Elton John during the primetime hour, followed by studio segments (again hosted by Wayne Brady) featuring performances by Blink-182, Bush, Busta Rhymes, Jessica Simpson, LFO, The O'Jays, and Pink. The primetime hour of New Year's Rockin' Eve 2002 was also preceded by ABC 2002, a follow-up to the ABC 2000 special hosted by Peter Jennings from the Rose Center for Earth and Space. The three-and-a-half-hour special featured a \"meaningful and reflective\" view on New Year's celebrations from around the world, and also included performances by Arlo Guthrie, Sting, and U2.[34] Clark personally felt that 2002, since it was the first in the wake of the September 11 attacks, was the most \"nerve-racking\" New Year's Eve he had ever experienced.[18] On December 8, 2004, it was reported that Clark had been hospitalized after suffering from a minor stroke. Despite Clark indicating his participation in New Year's Rockin' Eve 2005 in a prepared statement, reports soon surfaced that the stroke may have been serious enough to prevent him from hosting at all.[35] It was officially announced on December 14 that Dick Clark would not be hosting, and that Regis Philbin would fill in for Clark. In a statement, Clark said that he was thankful that Philbin was able to quickly step in on short notice to host the show, and hoped that he would do a good job. Philbin was optimistic about his role, considering it the \"best temp job ever\".[22] Various personalities paid tribute to Clark throughout the night on New Year's Eve; the New Year's Rockin' Eve broadcast featured special celebrity messages for Clark, and revelers in Times Square were seen with signs saluting Clark. During CNN's coverage, revelers in Times Square told CNN's Jason Carroll that Philbin was \"all right\" filling in for Clark (but that they still had Anderson Cooper and Carroll too).[36] Mayor Michael Bloomberg also spoke with Philbin on Clark's absence during the show, noting that \"it isn't that we don't like Regis, but we want [Clark] back next year.\"[37] Philbin's hosting received mixed reviews: Richard Huff of the New York Daily News noted that Philbin's hosting was \"stiff\" at first, and suggested that he would have performed better if he had a co-host to interact with like his daytime talk show Live with Regis and Kelly. In conclusion, he considered Philbin's performance to be \"suitable ‚Äì although not spectacular\".[37] Virginia Heffernan of The New York Times believed that Philbin was feeling \"surprisingly nervous\" in his role at host, and felt that \"rowdy crowds\" (which Philbin chose to avoid by staying in the studio) and the success of Rod Stewart's career (which Philbin pounced on to promote his new album, \"When You're Smiling\") were bothering him.[38] In August 2005, ABC announced that Dick Clark would return to New Year's Rockin' Eve for its 2006 edition, marking his first television appearance since the stroke. For that broadcast, it was also announced Clark would be joined by a new co-host, media personality and American Idol host Ryan Seacrest. Seacrest had previously hosted Fox's competing New Year's Eve Live‚Äîwhich, ironically, would be hosted by Philbin that year. Speaking to USA Today, Seacrest reminisced on having watched New Year's Rockin' Eve in his childhood, stating that \"I knew when I was on other shows, I knew we weren't going to beat Dick Clark. He is New Year's Eve.\"[39][40] As a part of a long-term deal with Dick Clark Productions, Seacrest also became an executive producer for the special.[39] In an interview with People Magazine in December 2005, Seacrest revealed that while Clark had not completely recovered from the stroke, and that his speech was not exactly like how it was beforehand, Clark had made great progress since the original diagnosis.[41] Alongside pre-recorded performances from Hollywood hosted by actress and pop singer Hilary Duff, the 2006 edition also featured a live performance by Mariah Carey directly inside Times Square ‚Äì the first such performance in the show's history. Live performances from Times Square became a regular feature during future editions of New Year's Rockin' Eve.[13][6][42] During the program, Clark made limited on-air appearances, but still conducted his traditional countdown, and also recollected on his recent experiences: Last year I had a stroke. It left me in bad shape. I had to teach myself how to walk and talk again. It's been a long, hard fight. My speech is not perfect but I'm getting there.[43] Public curiosity over Clark's condition and his return to television helped Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve 2006 draw in over 20 million viewers throughout the night, and score a 7.1 audience share among the key demographic of 18- to 49-year-olds.[44] Reaction to Clark's appearance was mixed. While some TV critics (including Tom Shales of The Washington Post, in an interview with the CBS Radio Network) felt he was not in good enough shape to do the broadcast, stroke survivors and many of Clark's fans praised the emcee for being a role model for people dealing with post-stroke recovery.[45] The New York Times Brian Stelter compared Seacrest's new role as co-host of Rockin' Eve to being like a \"traffic cop\", \"tossing to bands and correspondents and to Mr. Clark for the countdown\".[2] Following the 2006 edition, Dick Clark Productions announced that Seacrest had agreed to remain a host for future editions of New Year's Rockin' Eve.[44] As he was still afflicted with speech impediments that resulted from dysarthria, a lingering effect of his stroke, Clark's role in the special was reduced; he continued to make limited on-air appearances from Times Square Studios as co-host near midnight, and still conducted his traditional countdown, but Seacrest hosted the majority of the program outside in Times Square itself.[2] The 2008 edition featured live performances from Times Square by Carrie Underwood, Miley Cyrus, and the Jonas Brothers. Fergie of The Black Eyed Peas hosted concert segments from Hollywood, which also featured performances by Akon, Natasha Bedingfield, Sean Kingston, OneRepublic, Plain White T's, Taylor Swift and will.i.am.[46] Seacrest's increased role as host was recognized beginning on the 2009 edition, as the special was officially renamed Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest.[2] It featured live performances by the Jonas Brothers, Taylor Swift, and Lionel Richie, with Kellie Pickler serving as a correspondent. Hollywood segments featured performances by Fall Out Boy, Jesse McCartney, Natasha Bedingfield, Ne-Yo, The Pussycat Dolls, Solange, Robin Thicke and, will.i.am.[47] For its 2010 edition, headlining performances in Times Square included Daughtry, and Jennifer Lopez (who infamously wore a dark-colored catsuit for her performance to mixed reviews),[48] while Melissa Rycroft served as a correspondent. Fergie hosted concert segments on-location from Las Vegas, Nevada, featuring performances by her group The Black Eyed Peas, Colbie Caillat, Robin Thicke, Keri Hilson, Selena Gomez, Justin Bieber, David Guetta, and Orianthi.[49] American Idol season 8 runner-up Adam Lambert stated that he was also reportedly scheduled to perform, but dropped from both Rockin' Eve and a scheduled appearance on fellow ABC program Jimmy Kimmel Live! in response to his controversial performance at the American Music Awards (which are also produced by Dick Clark Productions). Neither ABC nor Dick Clark Productions ever confirmed whether or not Lambert had been booked at all, however.[50] The 2011 edition featured live performances by Kesha, Taio Cruz and the supergroup NKOTBSB (the combined Backstreet Boys and New Kids on the Block), and actress Jenny McCarthy served as a reporter from Times Square. Fergie reprised her role as host for the pre-recorded Hollywood segments,[51] which included performances by Avril Lavigne (featuring the world premiere of \"What the Hell\", the lead single from her then-upcoming album Goodbye Lullaby),[52] Natasha Bedingfield (who performed her latest single \"Strip Me\"), Jennifer Hudson, Ne-Yo, Train, Mike Posner, Willow Smith, Jason Der√ºlo, Far East Movement, La Roux, Kesha, and Drake.[51] Viewership for the 2011 edition peaked at around 19 million viewers.[2] The 2011‚Äì12 edition was once again hosted by Seacrest, with Clark co-hosting what would become his final appearance on the program.[53] Fergie co-hosted for the sixth consecutive year for the pre-taped Hollywood segments, while Jenny McCarthy returned for her second year corresponding from Times Square.[54] Musical guests in Times Square included Lady Gaga (who also joined Mayor Michael Bloomberg in activating the ball drop), Justin Bieber, Pitbull and Hot Chelle Rae.[54] Performers in the Hollywood segments included Taio Cruz, Nicki Minaj, Blink-182, Florence and the Machine, LMFAO, Gym Class Heroes, OneRepublic (at Disneyland), The Band Perry, will.i.am, Christina Perri,[55] and Robin Thicke.[2] To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the first edition of New Year's Rockin' Eve aired in 1972, the primetime portion of the show was preceded by a two-hour retrospective special focusing on memorable music performances from the show's history.[2] New Year's Rockin' Eve 2012 brought ABC's highest ratings on New Year's Eve since ABC 2000 Today; an average 8.4 million viewers watched the retrospective segment, the primetime hour brought in 12.9 million viewers, and the first hour of the main broadcast peaked at 22.6 million viewers. These numbers excluded viewership from locations such as bars and New Year's Eve parties, as Nielsen ratings do not account for out-of-home viewership (however, the company announced on October 24, 2016, that it would begin to offer out-of-home ratings data to broadcasters in April 2017).[3][1] On April 18, 2012, Dick Clark died after suffering a heart attack following surgery to fix an enlarged prostate.[56][53] Neither ABC or Dick Clark Productions immediately commented on the future of the program.[56] In August 2012, ABC confirmed via a press release that New Year's Rockin' Eve would return for its 2012‚Äì13 edition.[57] The primetime hour of this edition was preceded by a two-hour tribute special, New Year's Rockin' Eve Celebrates Dick Clark.[58] Clark's legacy was also recognized by the Times Square Alliance, organizers of the ball drop: a triangular Waterford Crystal panel engraved with Dick Clark's name was presented to his widow Kari Wigton and installed on the ball.[13] On October 23, 2013, Dick Clark Productions confirmed the 2013‚Äì14 edition of New Year's Rockin' Eve, and announced that Ryan Seacrest had signed a multi-year deal of unspecified length to continue serving as host and executive producer of the special. Seacrest stated that he would \"forever be both sentimental and grateful\" about his involvement in the special, and that he was \"excited to work together to create new traditions and fun moments on the show that only live television can deliver.\" Fellow producer Allen Shapiro credited Seacrest's involvement in New Year's Rockin' Eve for its \"extended and expanded\" success.[59][60] That year, the special was aired in simulcast in Canada for first time by Citytv, replacing its coverage of concert festivities at Toronto's Nathan Phillips Square (the network's local station continued to sponsor the event, however).[61][62] While viewership was down by 5%, New Year's Rockin' Eve was still the highest-rated among the New Year's specials.[63] On February 7, 2014, ABC announced that it had renewed New Year's Rockin' Eve through 2024.[64] The 2016 edition featured One Direction's final U.S. television appearance before their planned hiatus.[65] That year, New Year's Rockin' Eve was once again the highest rated of the New Year's Eve specials across the major networks; for the late-night portion, while overall household viewership was down by 7%, ratings in the 18‚Äì49 demographic were up by 3%.[66] The 2017 edition expanded to feature coverage of New Year's Eve festivities in New Orleans hosted by Lucy Hale, with performances by Jason Derulo and Panic! at the Disco from the Sugar Bowl's Allstate Fan Fest concert, and Jackson Square's fleur-de-lis drop at midnight in the Central Time Zone.[67][68][69] The segments are subsidized by New Orleans and the state of Louisiana as a means of promoting tourism.[70] While household ratings for the late-night portion of the broadcast were down by 9% in comparison to 2016, New Year's Rockin' Eve was once again the highest-rated New Year's special across the major networks, with a 9.0 rating in metered markets, and a 6.8 rating among adults 18‚Äì49.[71] Mariah Carey was one of the Times Square headliners for the 2017 edition. Her performance was notably marred by technical issues; when opening with \"Emotions\", Carey remarked throughout the song that she was unable to hear her backing track. On her second song, \"We Belong Together\", she briefly sang the song with a backing track before abruptly stopping. A representative of the singer claimed that Carey had alerted production staff that her in-ear monitors were not working, but that they refused to address the situation, and alleged that they were \"[setting] her up to fail\".[72][73][74] Dick Clark Productions denied any wrongdoing, stating that they \"had no involvement\" in the incident, and that the allegations by Carey's management that they had intentionally sabotaged her performance were \"defamatory, outrageous and frankly absurd\".[75] New Jersey's Casino Reinvestment Development Authority (CRDA) had announced plans for a live performance from Atlantic City's Boardwalk Hall by an unannounced artist,[76] but these plans fell through, citing \"scheduling conflicts and other considerations\".[77] The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the CRDA's contract to host the DCP-produced Miss America pageant in Atlantic City contained provisions allowing \"promotional accommodations\" for the city in other DCP-produced programming, such as New Year's Rockin' Eve and the Billboard Music Awards. Robert Mulcahy, chairman of the board for the CRDA, explained that Live Nation (which was to fund the broadcast using cash left over from cancelled beach concerts) were unable to find an act that met the approval of DCP, and added that local casinos declined to fund the performance, as they preferred to host their own parties rather than book major acts.[78][76] Despite the previous year's incident, Carey was subsequently invited to perform in Times Square again for New Year's Rockin' Eve 2018, in what media outlets described as an attempt at \"redemption\".[79][80][81] The 2018 edition saw major ratings gains, especially in primetime; the 8:00‚Äì10:00 p.m. primetime segment reached 10.5 million viewers with a 3.1/13 rating among 18-49s, and the 10:00 p.m. hour reached 15.7 million viewers and a 5.0/20 rating among 18-49s‚Äîthe highest ratings to date for the 10:00 p.m. segment. New Year's Rockin' Eve's only major competitor on English-language network television was Fox's inaugural New Year's Eve with Steve Harvey, as NBC was committed to air Sunday Night Football if the NFL shifted a Week 17 game with playoff implications into primetime (however, the NFL decided against doing so, and NBC thus aired rerun programming in primetime instead).[82][83] On November 13, 2018, it was announced that YouTube Music would be a presenting sponsor of the 2019 edition. The service is also presenting sponsor of the DCP-produced American Music Awards.[84][85] With the return of NBC's New Year's Eve after a hiatus, the 2019 edition experienced a decline in ratings to an 8.3 household share for its late-night portion, but was once again the top-rated among the New Year's specials.[86] On October 7, 2019, Jenny McCarthy stated on Live with Kelly and Ryan that she would not appear as the Times Square correspondent for the 2020 edition of New Year's Rockin' Eve, citing a desire to spend the holiday with her family, and her commitments to season 3 of Fox's The Masked Singer.[87] Lucy Hale would serve as Times Square correspondent in place of McCarthy, and Billy Porter of the FX series Pose hosted the New Orleans segments in place of Hale, and also performed his song \"Love Yourself\".[88] Ciara again hosted the Hollywood concert segments. Longtime ABC News journalist Barbara Walters (via file footage) and other ABC personalities also played into a social media meme involving her longtime intro to the ABC newsmagazine 20/20, by noting in a segment that \"This is 2020\".[89][90] The broadcast also introduced a sponsored segment featuring a \"first millionaire of 2020\" promotion by the Powerball lottery.[91] Hale and Porter were named Times Square correspondents for the 2021 edition.[92][93] Cyndi Lauper performed a duet with Porter‚Äîwho had been a cast member for her Broadway musical Kinky Boots.[94] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, both the Times Square[95] and New Orleans[70] celebrations televised by the special were held with no public attendance (with the former featuring a limited audience of essential workers and their families).[95] The special featured an on-air interview between Seacrest and President-elect Joe Biden and his wife Jill Biden.[96] Big Freedia hosted the New Orleans segments of the special.[97] In December 2020, it was reported that Mayor of New Orleans LaToya Cantrell had sent a letter to DCP requesting that Lauren Daigle (a Christian singer from Louisiana who had seen recent success as a pop crossover) not appear as a New Orleans-based performer for the special, citing her recent guest appearance during a worship event organized by Sean Feucht that was not approved by the city, and violated COVID-19-related public health orders.[98] After criticism of the letter by state lieutenant governor Billy Nungesser (who maintained that Daigle had mistaken it for a legitimate event), a DCP staff member told The Times-Picayune | The New Orleans Advocate that Daigle had not actually been booked at all.[70] On December 16, 2021, it was announced that Seacrest had signed a multi-year extension with DCP's parent company MRC to continue his role as host and EP of New Year's Rockin' Eve. (MRC discontinued Dick Clark Productions as a studio imprint in September 2021, and moved all of its productions under the MRC Live & Alternative banner; this change was reversed after the merger of MRC and Eldridge Industries' media properties was unwound in 2022.)[99][100][101] The 2022 edition‚Äîwhich marked the 50th anniversary of the first edition of New Year's Rockin' Eve‚Äîadded coverage from the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, consisting of segments from Distrito T-Mobile in San Juan, Puerto Rico hosted by Roselyn S√°nchez and headlined by rapper Daddy Yankee, and the special's first broadcast of midnight celebrations in the Atlantic Time Zone to conclude the primetime block at 11:00 p.m. ET.[8][9] Billy Porter returned as host of the New Orleans segments, while Liza Koshy reported from Times Square.[102] D-Nice also made guest appearances for the Los Angeles segments alongside Ciara.[103] While LL Cool J was originally announced as one of the headlining acts in Times Square, he was dropped on December 29 due to a COVID-19 infection. Chl√∂e was also dropped from the special for unspecified reasons.[104] On December 31, ABC announced that Karol G had dropped out, but that Ashanti and Ja Rule had also joined the lineup.[105] ABC confirmed that Koshy, Porter, Ciara, and D-Nice would all return in their respective roles for the 2023 edition. To promote its upcoming \"100 Years of Wonder\" events for The Walt Disney Company's centennial year, concert segments were also filmed at Disneyland in Anaheim.[106] The special also returned to Puerto Rico, with Farruko as featured performer and Dayanara Torres as host.[107][10] In a major change in scheduling emulating what NBC implemented the previous year for its newly-introduced special Miley's New Year's Eve Party,[108][109] \"Part 1\" of the primetime block now ended at 10:00 p.m. ET/PT rather than 11:00, and resumed with \"Part 2\" from 10:30‚Äî11:30 p.m. ET/PT, which included the Atlantic Time countdown from San Juan. The 11:30 p.m.‚Äî12:36 a.m. block containing the Times Square ball drop was now billed as \"Part 1\" of the late-night broadcast.[110][111][note 1] Viewership for the Times Square leg of the special saw a major year-over-year decline, falling from 19.6 million to 13.2 million viewers. However, ABC still finished first overall in total and key demographic audience share.[111] On November 20, 2023, ABC and Dick Clark Productions announced that it had renewed New Year's Rockin' Eve through 2028‚Äì29.[4] The 2023‚Äì24 edition featured several major changes. Coverage from New Orleans was discontinued‚Äîremoving a formal Central Time Zone countdown from the broadcast‚Äîdue to a lack of local tourism and municipal subsidies to put on the ceremony.[112] Rita Ora was announced as the new Times Square co-host, with Jeannie Mai now hosting the Hollywood segments.[113] An audio simulcast of the special was also carried by iHeartMedia hot adult contemporary and top 40 stations, as an extension of the company's recent partnership with ABC to broadcast its iHeartRadio Music Festival and Jingle Ball Tour specials (Seacrest also hosts two nationally-syndicated radio shows distributed by iHeartMedia, American Top 40 and On Air with Ryan Seacrest).[114][115] Ratings improved over 2023, with the primetime block averaging 8.4 million viewers, and 18 million for part 1 of the late-night portion (peaking at 22 million near midnight).[116] On November 15, 2024, it was announced that the special would air live midnight celebrations from the Pacific Time Zone for the first time during the 2024‚Äì25 edition (airing within \"Part 2\" of the main late-night broadcast, which, ever since its debut in 1997‚Äì98, had been recorded in Hollywood weeks before New Year's Rockin' Eve airs), originating from Las Vegas in partnership with MGM Resorts.[14] Rob Gronkowski will serve as the host for the Las Vegas segments.[117] As New Year's Rockin' Eve gained prominence in American pop culture as an annual mainstay, Clark made appearances in other television series and movies referencing his role. During a Y2K-themed short in The Simpsons' 1999 Halloween special \"Treehouse of Horror X\", Clark made a cameo appearance hosting a New Year's Eve event in Springfield. The Y2K bug caused the emcee to melt, exposing him as a robot.[178] In a commentary with one of the episode's writers, Ron Hauge, for the show's Season 11 DVD release, Clark said that the episode had the \"biggest response\" he had ever gotten from anything he had ever done.[179] Clark also made an appearance during the pilot episode of fellow Matt Groening series Futurama, \"Space Pilot 3000\", where the emcee (now portrayed as a head preserved in a jar) is seen hosting New Year's Rockin' Eve 3000.[180] In the 1994 film Forrest Gump, footage of Clark from the first edition of New Year's Rockin' Eve is seen on a television at a bar during a scene of the film taking place on New Year's Eve in 1972.[181] New Year's Rockin' Eve itself was the subject of an episode of Friends, \"The One with the Routine\", in which Janine, Joey, Ross and Monica attend a studio taping as audience members.[note 2][182][183]",

                "content": "Alabama (/Àå√¶l…ôÀàb√¶m…ô/ AL-…ô-BAM-…ô)[9] is a state in the Southeastern region of the United States. It borders Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and Mississippi to the west. Alabama is the 30th largest by area, and the 24th-most populous of the 50 U.S. states.[10][11] Alabama is nicknamed the Yellowhammer State, after the state bird. Alabama is also known as the \"Heart of Dixie\" and the \"Cotton State\". The state has diverse geography, with the north dominated by the mountainous Tennessee Valley and the south by Mobile Bay, a historically significant port. Alabama's capital is Montgomery, and its largest city by population and area is Huntsville.[12] Its oldest city is Mobile, founded by French colonists (Alabama Creoles) in 1702 as the capital of French Louisiana.[13][14] Greater Birmingham is Alabama's largest metropolitan area and its economic center.[15] Politically, as part of the Deep South, or \"Bible Belt\", Alabama is a predominantly conservative state, and is known for its Southern culture. Within Alabama, American football, particularly at the college level, plays a major part of the state's culture. Originally home to many native tribes, present-day Alabama was a Spanish territory beginning in the sixteenth century until the French acquired it in the early eighteenth century. The British won the territory in 1763 until losing it in the American Revolutionary War. Spain held Mobile as part of Spanish West Florida until 1813. In December 1819, Alabama was recognized as a state. During the antebellum period, Alabama was a major producer of cotton, and widely used African American slave labor. In 1861, the state seceded from the United States to become part of the Confederate States of America, with Montgomery acting as its first capital, and rejoined the Union in 1868. Following the American Civil War, Alabama would suffer decades of economic hardship, in part due to agriculture and a few cash crops being the main driver of the state's economy. Similar to other former slave states, Alabamian legislators employed Jim Crow laws from the late 19th century up until the 1960s. High-profile events such as the Selma to Montgomery marches made the state a major focal point of the civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s. During and after World War II, Alabama grew as the state's economy diversified with new industries. In 1960, the establishment of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville helped boost Alabama's economic growth by developing a local aerospace industry. Alabama's economy in the 21st century is based on automotive, finance, tourism, manufacturing, aerospace, mineral extraction, healthcare, education, retail, and technology.[16] The name of the Alabama River and state is derived from the Alabama people, a Muskogean-speaking tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers on the upper reaches of the river.[17] In the Alabama language, the word for a person of Alabama lineage is Albaamo (or variously Albaama or Alb√†amo in different dialects; the plural form is Albaamaha).[18] The word's spelling varies significantly among historical sources.[19] The first usage appears in three accounts of the Hernando de Soto expedition of 1540: Garcilaso de la Vega used Alibamo, while the Knight of Elvas and Rodrigo Ranjel wrote Alibamu and Limamu, respectively, in transliterations of the term.[19] As early as 1702, the French called the tribe the Alibamon, with French maps identifying the river as Rivi√®re des Alibamons.[17] Other spellings of the name have included Alibamu, Alabamo, Albama, Alebamon, Alibama, Alibamou, Alabamu, and Allibamou.[19][20][21] The use of state names derived from Native American languages is common in the U.S. An estimated 26 states have names of Native American origin.[22] Sources disagree on the word's meaning. Some scholars suggest the word comes from the Choctaw alba (meaning 'plants' or 'weeds') and amo (meaning 'to cut', 'to trim', or 'to gather').[19][23][24] The meaning may have been 'clearers of the thicket'[23] or 'herb gatherers',[24][25] referring to clearing land for cultivation[20] or collecting medicinal plants.[25] The state has numerous place names of Native American origin.[26][27] An 1842 article in the Jacksonville Republican proposed it meant 'Here We Rest'.[19] This notion was popularized in the 1850s through the writings of Alexander Beaufort Meek.[19] Experts in the Muskogean languages have not found any evidence to support such a translation.[17][19] Indigenous peoples of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before the advent of European colonization. Trade with the northeastern tribes by the Ohio River began during the Burial Mound Period (1000 BC ‚Äì 700 AD) and continued until European contact.[28] The agrarian Mississippian culture covered most of the state from 1000 to 1600 AD, with one of its major centers built at what is now the Moundville Archaeological Site in Moundville, Alabama.[29][30] This is the second-largest complex of the classic Middle Mississippian era, after Cahokia in present-day Illinois, which was the center of the culture. Analysis of artifacts from archaeological excavations at Moundville were the basis of scholars' formulating the characteristics of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (SECC).[31] Contrary to popular belief, the SECC appears to have no direct links to Mesoamerican culture but developed independently. The Ceremonial Complex represents a major component of the religion of the Mississippian peoples; it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood.[32] Among the historical tribes of Native American people living in present-day Alabama at the time of European contact were the Cherokee, an Iroquoian language people; and the Muskogean-speaking Alabama (Alibamu), Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Koasati.[33] While part of the same large language family, the Muskogee tribes developed distinct cultures and languages. The Spanish were the first Europeans to reach Alabama during their exploration of North America in the 16th century. The expedition of Hernando de Soto passed through Mabila and other parts of the state in 1540. More than 160 years later, the French founded the region's first European settlement at Old Mobile in 1702.[34] The city was moved to the current site of Mobile in 1711. This area was claimed by the French from 1702 to 1763 as part of La Louisiane.[35] After the French lost to the British in the Seven Years' War, it became part of British West Florida from 1763 to 1783. After the U.S. victory in the American Revolutionary War, the territory was divided between the United States and Spain. The latter retained control of this western territory from 1783 until the surrender of the Spanish garrison at Mobile to U.S. forces on April 13, 1813.[35][36] Thomas Bassett, a loyalist to the British monarchy during the Revolutionary era, was one of the earliest white settlers in the state outside Mobile. He settled in the Tombigbee District during the early 1770s.[37] The district's boundaries were roughly limited to the area within a few miles of the Tombigbee River and included portions of what is today southern Clarke County, northernmost Mobile County, and most of Washington County.[38][39] What are now Baldwin and Mobile counties became part of Spanish West Florida in 1783, part of the independent Republic of West Florida in 1810, and finally part of the Mississippi Territory in 1812. Most of what is now the northern two-thirds of Alabama was known as the Yazoo lands beginning during the British colonial period. It was claimed by the Province of Georgia from 1767 onwards. Following the American Revolutionary War, it remained a part of Georgia, although heavily disputed.[40][41] With the exception of the area around Mobile and the Yazoo lands, what is now the lower one-third of Alabama was made part of the Mississippi Territory when it was organized in 1798. The Yazoo lands were added to the territory in 1804, following the Yazoo land scandal.[41][42] Spain kept a claim on its former Spanish West Florida territory in what would become the coastal counties until the Adams‚ÄìOn√≠s Treaty officially ceded it to the U.S. in 1819.[36] Before Mississippi's admission to statehood on December 10, 1817, the more sparsely settled eastern half of the territory was separated and named the Alabama Territory. The United States Congress created the Alabama Territory on March 3, 1817. St. Stephens, now abandoned, served as the territorial capital from 1817 to 1819.[43] Alabama was admitted as the 22nd state on December 14, 1819, with Congress selecting Huntsville as the site for the first Constitutional Convention. From July 5 to August 2, 1819, delegates met to prepare the new state constitution. Huntsville served as temporary capital from 1819 to 1820, when the seat of government moved to Cahaba in Dallas County.[44] Cahaba, now a ghost town, was the first permanent state capital from 1820 to 1825.[45] The Alabama Fever land rush was underway when the state was admitted to the Union, with settlers and land speculators pouring into the state to take advantage of fertile land suitable for cotton cultivation.[46][47] Part of the frontier in the 1820s and 1830s, its constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men.[48] Southeastern planters and traders from the Upper South brought slaves with them as the cotton plantations in Alabama expanded. The economy of the central Black Belt (named for its dark, productive soil) was built around large cotton plantations whose owners' wealth grew mainly from slave labor.[48] The area also drew many poor, disenfranchised people who became subsistence farmers. Alabama had an estimated population of under 10,000 people in 1810, but it increased to more than 300,000 people by 1830.[46] Most Native American tribes were completely removed from the state within a few years of the passage of the Indian Removal Act by Congress in 1830.[49] From 1826 to 1846, Tuscaloosa served as Alabama's capital. On January 30, 1846, the Alabama legislature announced it had voted to move the capital city from Tuscaloosa to Montgomery. The first legislative session in the new capital met in December 1847.[50] A new capitol building was erected under the direction of Stephen Decatur Button of Philadelphia. The first structure burned down in 1849, but was rebuilt on the same site in 1851. This second capitol building in Montgomery remains to the present day. It was designed by Barachias Holt of Exeter, Maine.[51][52] By 1860, the population had increased to 964,201 people, of which nearly half, 435,080, were enslaved African Americans, and 2,690 were free people of color.[53] On January 11, 1861, Alabama declared its secession from the Union. After remaining an independent republic for a few days, it joined the Confederate States of America. The Confederacy's capital was initially at Montgomery. Alabama was heavily involved in the American Civil War. Although comparatively few battles were fought in the state, Alabama contributed about 120,000 soldiers to the war effort. A company of cavalry soldiers from Huntsville, Alabama, joined Nathan Bedford Forrest's battalion in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. The company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves, collar and coattails. This led to them being greeted with \"Yellowhammer\", and the name later was applied to all Alabama troops in the Confederate Army.[54] Alabama's slaves were freed by the 13th Amendment in 1865.[55] Alabama was under military rule from the end of the war in May 1865 until its official restoration to the Union in 1868. From 1867 to 1874, with most white citizens barred temporarily from voting and freedmen enfranchised, many African Americans emerged as political leaders in the state. Alabama was represented in Congress during this period by three African-American congressmen: Jeremiah Haralson, Benjamin S. Turner, and James T. Rapier.[56] Following the war, the state remained chiefly agricultural, with an economy tied to cotton. During the Reconstruction era, state legislators ratified a new state constitution in 1868 which created the state's first public school system and expanded women's rights. Legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects, although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation.[56] Organized insurgent, resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and Republicans. These groups included The Ku Klux Klan, the Pale Faces, Knights of the White Camellia, Red Shirts, and the White League.[56] Reconstruction in Alabama ended in 1874, when the Democrats regained control of the legislature and governor's office through an election dominated by fraud and violence. They wrote another constitution in 1875,[56] and the legislature passed the Blaine Amendment, prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious-affiliated schools.[57] The same year, legislation was approved that called for racially segregated schools.[58] Railroad passenger cars were segregated in 1891.[58] The new 1901 constitution of Alabama included provisions for voter registration that effectively disenfranchised large portions of the population, including nearly all African Americans and Native Americans, and tens of thousands of poor European Americans, through making voter registration difficult, requiring a poll tax and literacy test.[59] The 1901 constitution required racial segregation of public schools. By 1903 only 2,980 African Americans were registered in Alabama, although at least 74,000 were literate. This compared to more than 181,000 African Americans eligible to vote in 1900. The numbers dropped even more in later decades.[60] The state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities into the 1950s: jails were segregated in 1911; hospitals in 1915; toilets, hotels, and restaurants in 1928; and bus stop waiting rooms in 1945.[58] While the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting, the new restrictions resulted in their disenfranchisement as well, due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax.[60] By 1941, whites constituted a slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws: 600,000 whites vs. 520,000 African Americans.[60] Nearly all blacks had lost the ability to vote. Despite numerous legal challenges which succeeded in overturning certain provisions, the state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement. The exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in 1965 to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens.[61] The rural-dominated Alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised African Americans, but it did not relieve them of paying taxes.[48] Partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for African Americans in the South, the Rosenwald Fund began funding the construction of what came to be known as Rosenwald Schools. In Alabama, these schools were designed, and the construction partially financed with Rosenwald funds, which paid one-third of the construction costs. The fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest. Black residents effectively taxed themselves twice, by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools, which were built in many rural areas. They often donated land and labor as well.[62] Beginning in 1913, the first 80 Rosenwald Schools were built in Alabama for African American children. A total of 387 schools, seven teachers' houses, and several vocational buildings were completed by 1937 in the state. Several of the surviving school buildings in the state are now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[62] Continued racial discrimination and lynchings, agricultural depression, and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans from rural Alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the 20th century as part of the Great Migration out of the South.[63][64] Reflecting this emigration, the population growth rate in Alabama (see \"historical populations\" table below) dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920.[65] At the same time, many rural people migrated to the city of Birmingham to work in new industrial jobs. Birmingham experienced such rapid growth it was called the \"Magic City\".[66] By 1920, Birmingham was the 36th-largest city in the United States.[67] Heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy. Its residents were under-represented for decades in the state legislature, which refused to redistrict after each decennial census according to population changes, as it was required by the state constitution. This did not change until the late 1960s following a lawsuit and court order.[68] Beginning in the 1940s, when the courts started taking the first steps to recognize the voting rights of black voters, the Alabama legislature took several counter-steps designed to disfranchise black voters. The legislature passed, and the voters ratified [as these were mostly white voters], a state constitutional amendment that gave local registrars greater latitude to disqualify voter registration applicants. Black citizens in Mobile successfully challenged this amendment as a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment. The legislature also changed the boundaries of Tuskegee to a 28-sided figure designed to fence out blacks from the city limits. The Supreme Court unanimously held that this racial \"gerrymandering\" violated the Constitution. In 1961, ... the Alabama legislature also intentionally diluted the effect of the black vote by instituting numbered place requirements for local elections.[69] Industrial development related to the demands of World War II brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war.[48] Rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living. One example of this massive influx of workers occurred in Mobile. Between 1940 and 1943, more than 89,000 people moved into the city to work for war-related industries.[70] Cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base. Despite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961, the rural-dominated legislature refused to reapportion House and Senate seats based on population, as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses. They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas. One result was that Jefferson County, containing Birmingham's industrial and economic powerhouse, contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state, but did not receive a proportional amount in services. Urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature. A 1960 study noted that because of rural domination, \"a minority of about 25% of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature.\"[68][71] In the United States Supreme Court cases of Baker v. Carr (1962) and Reynolds v. Sims (1964), the court ruled that the principle of \"one man, one vote\" needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures, and that their districts had to be based on population rather than geographic counties.[72][73] African Americans continued to press in the 1950s and 1960s to end disenfranchisement and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement, including legal challenges. In 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that public schools had to be desegregated, but Alabama was slow to comply. During the 1960s, under Governor George Wallace, Alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for desegregation.[74][75] The civil rights movement had notable events in Alabama, including the Montgomery bus boycott (1955‚Äì1956), Freedom Rides in 1961, and 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches.[76] These contributed to Congressional passage and enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 by the U.S. Congress.[77][78] Legal segregation ended in the states in 1964, but Jim Crow customs often continued until specifically challenged in court.[79] According to The New York Times, by 2017, many of Alabama's African Americans were living in Alabama's cities such as Birmingham and Montgomery. Also, the Black Belt region across central Alabama \"is home to largely poor counties that are predominantly African-American. These counties include Dallas, Lowndes, Marengo and Perry.\"[80] In 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislature completed the congressional redistricting based on the decennial census. This benefited the urban areas that had developed, as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than sixty years.[71] Other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts. Alabama has made some changes since the late 20th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation. In the 1980s, an omnibus redistricting case, Dillard v. Crenshaw County, challenged the at-large voting for representative seats of 180 Alabama jurisdictions, including counties and school boards. At-large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county, as the majority tended to take all seats. Despite African Americans making up a significant minority in the state, they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at-large jurisdictions.[69] As part of settlement of this case, five Alabama cities and counties, including Chilton County, adopted a system of cumulative voting for election of representatives in multi-seat jurisdictions. This has resulted in more proportional representation for voters. In another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use limited voting, as in Conecuh County. In 1982, limited voting was first tested in Conecuh County. Together use of these systems has increased the number of African Americans and women being elected to local offices, resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens.[81] Beginning in the 1960s, the state's economy shifted away from its traditional lumber, steel, and textile industries because of increased foreign competition. Steel jobs, for instance, declined from 46,314 in 1950 to 14,185 in 2011.[82] However, the state, particularly Huntsville, benefited from the opening of the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center in 1960, a major facility in the development of the Saturn rocket program and the space shuttle. Technology and manufacturing industries, such as automobile assembly, replaced some the state's older industries in the late twentieth century, but the state's economy and growth lagged behind other states in the area, such as Georgia and Florida.[83] In 2001, Alabama Supreme Court chief justice Roy Moore installed a statue of the Ten Commandments in the capitol in Montgomery. In 2002, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court ordered the statue removed, but Moore refused to follow the court order, which led to protests around the capitol in favor of keeping the monument. The monument was removed in August 2003.[84] A few natural disasters have occurred in the state in the twenty-first century. In 2004, Hurricane Ivan, a category 3 storm upon landfall, struck the state and caused over $18 billion of damage. It was among the most destructive storms to strike the state in its modern history.[85] A super outbreak of 62 tornadoes hit the state in April 2011 and killed 238 people, devastating many communities.[86] Alabama is the thirtieth-largest state in the United States with 52,419 square miles (135,760 km2) of total area: 3.2% of the area is water, making Alabama 23rd in the amount of surface water, also giving it the second-largest inland waterway system in the United States.[87] About three-fifths of the land area is part of the Gulf Coastal Plain, a gentle plain with a general descent towards the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico. The North Alabama region is mostly mountainous, with the Tennessee River cutting a large valley and creating numerous creeks, streams, rivers, mountains, and lakes.[88] Alabama is bordered by the states of Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida to the south, and Mississippi to the west. Alabama has coastline at the Gulf of Mexico, in the extreme southern edge of the state.[88] The state ranges in elevation from sea level[89] at Mobile Bay to more than 2,000 feet (610 m) in the northeast, to Mount Cheaha[88] at 2,413 ft (735 m).[90] Alabama's land consists of 22 million acres (89,000 km2) of forest or 67% of the state's total land area.[91] Suburban Baldwin County, along the Gulf Coast, is the largest county in the state in both land area and water area.[92] Areas in Alabama administered by the National Park Service include Horseshoe Bend National Military Park near Alexander City; Little River Canyon National Preserve near Fort Payne; Russell Cave National Monument in Bridgeport; Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site in Tuskegee; and Tuskegee Institute National Historic Site near Tuskegee.[93] Additionally, Alabama has four National Forests: Conecuh, Talladega, Tuskegee, and William B. Bankhead.[94] Alabama also contains the Natchez Trace Parkway, the Selma To Montgomery National Historic Trail, and the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail. Natural wonders include the \"Natural Bridge\" rock, the longest natural bridge east of the Rockies, just south of Haleyville; Cathedral Caverns, in Marshall County, named for its cathedral-like appearance, which features one of the largest cave entrances and one of the largest stalagmites in the world; Ecor Rouge, in Fairhope, the highest coastline point between Maine and Mexico;[95] DeSoto Caverns, in Childersburg, the first officially recorded cave in the United States;[96] Noccalula Falls, in Gadsden, which has a 90-foot waterfall; Dismals Canyon, near Phil Campbell, which is home to two waterfalls and six natural bridges and is said to have been a hideout of Jesse James;[97] Stephens Gap Cave, in Jackson County, which has a 143-foot pit and two waterfalls and is one of the most photographed wild cave scenes in America;[98] Little River Canyon, near Fort Payne, one of the nation's longest mountaintop rivers; Rickwood Caverns, near Warrior, which has an underground pool, blind cave-fish, and 260-million-year-old limestone formations; and the Walls of Jericho canyon, on the Alabama‚ÄìTennessee border. A 5-mile (8 km)-wide meteorite impact crater is located in Elmore County, just north of Montgomery. This is the Wetumpka crater, the site of \"Alabama's greatest natural disaster\". A 1,000-foot (300 m)-wide meteorite hit the area about 80 million years ago.[99] The hills just east of downtown Wetumpka showcase the eroded remains of the impact crater that was blasted into the bedrock, with the area labeled the Wetumpka crater or astrobleme (\"star-wound\") because of the concentric rings of fractures and zones of shattered rock that can be found beneath the surface.[100] In 2002, Christian Koeberl with the Institute of Geochemistry University of Vienna published evidence and established the site as the 157th recognized impact crater on Earth.[101] The state is classified as humid subtropical (Cfa) under the K√∂ppen climate classification.[102] The average annual temperature is 64 ¬∞F (18 ¬∞C). Temperatures tend to be warmer in the southern part of the state with its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, while the northern parts of the state, especially in the Appalachian Mountains in the northeast, tend to be slightly cooler.[103] Generally, Alabama has very hot summers and mild winters with copious precipitation throughout the year. Alabama receives an average of 56 inches (1,400 mm) of rainfall annually and enjoys a lengthy growing season of up to 300 days in the southern part of the state.[103] Summers in Alabama are among the hottest in the U.S., with high temperatures averaging over 90 ¬∞F (32 ¬∞C) throughout the summer in some parts of the state. Alabama is also prone to tropical storms and hurricanes. Areas of the state far away from the Gulf are not immune to the effects of the storms, which often dump tremendous amounts of rain as they move inland and weaken. South Alabama reports many thunderstorms. The Gulf Coast, around Mobile Bay, averages between 70 and 80 days per year with thunder reported. This activity decreases somewhat further north in the state, but even the far north of the state reports thunder on about 60 days per year. Occasionally, thunderstorms are severe with frequent lightning and large hail; the central and northern parts of the state are most vulnerable to this type of storm. Alabama ranks ninth in the number of deaths from lightning and tenth in the number of deaths from lightning strikes per capita.[104] Alabama, along with Oklahoma and Iowa, has the most confirmed F5 and EF5 tornadoes of any state, according to statistics from the National Climatic Data Center for the period January 1, 1950, to June 2013.[105] Several long-tracked F5/EF5 tornadoes have contributed to Alabama reporting more tornado fatalities since 1950 than any other state. The state was affected by the 1974 Super Outbreak and was devastated tremendously by the 2011 Super Outbreak. The 2011 Super Outbreak produced a record amount of tornadoes in the state. The tally reached 62.[106] The peak season for tornadoes varies from the northern to southern parts of the state. Alabama is one of the few places in the world that has a secondary tornado season in November and December besides the typically severe spring. The northern part‚Äîalong the Tennessee River Valley‚Äîis most vulnerable. The area of Alabama and Mississippi most affected by tornadoes is sometimes referred to as Dixie Alley, as distinct from the Tornado Alley of the Southern Plains. Winters are generally mild in Alabama, as they are throughout most of the Southeastern United States, with average January low temperatures around 40 ¬∞F (4 ¬∞C) in Mobile and around 32 ¬∞F (0 ¬∞C) in Birmingham. Although snow is a rare event in much of Alabama, areas of the state north of Montgomery may receive a dusting of snow a few times every winter, with an occasional moderately heavy snowfall every few years. Historic snowfall events include New Year's Eve 1963 snowstorm and the 1993 Storm of the Century. The annual average snowfall for the Birmingham area is 2 inches (51 mm) per year. In the southern Gulf coast, snowfall is less frequent, sometimes going several years without any snowfall. Alabama's highest temperature of 112 ¬∞F (44 ¬∞C) was recorded on September 5, 1925, in the unincorporated community of Centerville. The record low of ‚àí27 ¬∞F (‚àí33 ¬∞C) occurred on January 30, 1966, in New Market.[107] Alabama is home to a diverse array of flora and fauna in habitats that range from the Tennessee Valley, Appalachian Plateau, and Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians of the north to the Piedmont, Canebrake, and Black Belt of the central region to the Gulf Coastal Plain and beaches along the Gulf of Mexico in the south. The state is usually ranked among the top in nation for its range of overall biodiversity.[112][113] Alabama is in the subtropical coniferous forest biome and once boasted huge expanses of pine forest, which still form the largest proportion of forests in the state.[112] It currently ranks fifth in the nation for the diversity of its flora. It is home to nearly 4,000 pteridophyte and spermatophyte plant species.[114] Indigenous animal species in the state include 62 mammal species,[115] 93 reptile species,[116] 73 amphibian species,[117] roughly 307 native freshwater fish species,[112] and 420 bird species that spend at least part of their year within the state.[118] Invertebrates include 97 crayfish species and 383 mollusk species. 113 of these mollusk species have never been collected outside the state.[119][120] As of 2010, the state contains 461 municipalities, consisting of 174 cities and 287 towns. Covering only 9.6% of Alabama's land mass, its municipalities are home to 60.4% of its population. Montgomery, the state's capital, is the third-most populous settlement in Alabama; and the most populous city is Huntsville. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the state contains 12 metropolitan statistical areas. Alabama's largest metropolitan area was Greater Birmingham. At the 1800 United States census, Alabama had a population of 1,250 people. Since then, the state has continued to experience population growth with every U.S. census. According to the 2020 United States census the population of Alabama was 5,024,279, which represents an increase of 244,543 or 5.12%, since the 2010 census.[123] This includes a natural increase since the last census of 121,054 (502,457 births minus 381,403 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 104,991 into the state.[124] According to statistics from 2012, immigration from outside the U.S. resulted in a net increase of 31,180 people, and migration within the country produced a net gain of 73,811 people.[124] The state had 108,000 foreign-born residents (2.4% of the state population), of which an estimated 22.2% were undocumented (24,000). The top countries of origin for immigrants were Mexico, China, India, Germany and Guatemala as of 2018.[125] According to HUD's 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 3,752 homeless people in Alabama.[126][127] With a population density of 99.2 people per square mile as of 2020,[128] the majority of the state's population lives in North, Central, and South Alabama, spread throughout the Huntsville, Birmingham, Montgomery and Mobile metropolitan statistical areas. The center of population of Alabama is located in Chilton County, outside the town of Jemison.[129] Many American Indian tribes such as the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Coushatta inhabited present-day Alabama before European colonization.[33] With Spanish, French, and British colonization of Alabama, white and black Americans migrated to the area. From European colonization to U.S. statehood, Alabama's population grew to become increasingly non-Hispanic white and African American. By the 2020 census, Alabama's total racial and ethnic population was 66.5% non-Hispanic white and 26.9% African American, with a growing Hispanic and Latino population of 5.3%.[130] Alabamans citing \"American\" ancestry are of overwhelmingly English extraction. Demographers estimate that a minimum of 20‚Äì23% of people in Alabama are of predominantly English ancestry and state that the figure is probably much higher. In the 1980 census, 1,139,976 people in Alabama cited that they were of English ancestry out of a total state population of 2,824,719 making them 41% of the state at the time and the largest ethnic group.[131][132][133] Alabama has the 5th-highest black and African American population among U.S. states at 25.8% alone as of 2020.[134] In 2011, 46.6% of Alabama's population younger than age 1 were minorities.[135] The largest reported ancestry groups in Alabama were American (13.4%), Irish (10.5%), English (10.2%), German (7.9%), and Scots-Irish (2.5%) based on 2006‚Äì2008 U.S. census data.[136] The Scots-Irish were the largest non-English immigrant group from the British Isles before the American Revolution, and many settled in the South, later moving into the Deep South as it was developed.[137] In 1984, under the Davis‚ÄìStrong Act, the state legislature established the Alabama Indian Affairs Commission.[138] Indigenous groups within the state had increasingly been demanding recognition as ethnic groups and seeking an end to discrimination. Given the long history of slavery and associated racial segregation, the Native American or American Indian peoples, who have sometimes been of mixed race, have insisted on having their cultural identification respected. In the past, their self-identification was often overlooked as the state tried to impose a binary breakdown of society into white and black. The state has officially recognized nine American Indian tribes in the state, descended mostly from the Five Civilized Tribes of the American Southeast. These are the following.[139] The state government has promoted recognition of American Indian contributions to the state, including the designation in 2000 for Columbus Day to be jointly celebrated as American Indian Heritage Day.[140] In 2020, 33,625 identified as being Native American alone, and 97,405 did in combination with one or more other races.[141] According to the 2022 American Community Survey's estimates, approximately 94% of Alabamans speak English as their sole language, while 6% spoke a language other than English.[142] Of other languages, the majority of its multilingual population speaks Spanish (3.8%). In a separate 2021 study by the American University Washington College of Law, Spanish was spoken by 156,656 residents.[143] Following, Korean, Vietnamese, Mandarin and Cantonese, German, French, and Tagalog were the most-spoken languages; among its French-speaking population, the majority have preserved their language since French colonization.[144] Pre-colonial and present-day Alabamans have adhered to multiple religions including Native American and African diaspora religions, and predominantly Christianity with the establishment of Spanish missions in Florida. Other faiths including Judaism, Islam, and Indian religions were introduced since European colonization and American settlement. According to a 2023 Public Religion Research Institute survey, an estimated 80% of the adult population were Christian.[145] In the 2008 American Religious Identification Survey, 86% of Alabama respondents reported their religion as Christian, including 6% Catholic, with 11% as having no religion.[146] The composition of other traditions is 0.5% Mormon, 0.5% Jewish, 0.5% Muslim, 0.5% Buddhist, and 0.5% Hindu.[147] Alabama is located in the middle of the Bible Belt, a region of numerous Protestant Christians. Alabama has been identified as one of the most religious states in the United States, with about 58% of the population attending church regularly.[148] A majority of people in the state identify as Evangelical Protestant. As of 2010[update], the three largest denominational groups in Alabama are the Southern Baptist Convention, The United Methodist Church, and non-denominational Evangelical Protestant.[149] In Alabama, the Southern Baptist Convention has the highest number of adherents with 1,380,121; this is followed by the United Methodist Church with 327,734 adherents, non-denominational Evangelical Protestant with 220,938 adherents, and the Catholic Church with 150,647 adherents. Many Baptist and Methodist congregations became established in the Great Awakening of the early 19th century, when preachers proselytized across the South. The Assemblies of God had almost 60,000 members, the Churches of Christ had nearly 120,000 members. The Presbyterian churches, strongly associated with Scots-Irish immigrants of the 18th century and their descendants, had a combined membership around 75,000 (PCA‚Äî28,009 members in 108 congregations, PC(USA)‚Äî26,247 members in 147 congregations,[150] the Cumberland Presbyterian Church‚Äî6,000 members in 59 congregations, the Cumberland Presbyterian Church in America‚Äî5,000 members and fifty congregations plus the EPC and Associate Reformed Presbyterians with 230 members and nine congregations).[151] In a 2007 survey, nearly 70% of respondents could name all four of the Christian Gospels. Of those who indicated a religious preference, 59% said they possessed a \"full understanding\" of their faith and needed no further learning.[152] In a 2007 poll, 92% of Alabamians reported having at least some confidence in churches in the state.[153][154] Although in much smaller numbers, many other religious faiths are represented in the state as well, including Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, and Unitarian Universalism.[151] Jews have been present in what is now Alabama since 1763, during the colonial era of Mobile, when Sephardic Jews immigrated from London.[155] The oldest Jewish congregation in the state is Congregation Sha'arai Shomayim in Mobile. It was formally recognized by the state legislature on January 25, 1844.[155] Later immigrants in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries tended to be Ashkenazi Jews from eastern Europe. Jewish denominations in the state include two Orthodox, four Conservative, ten Reform, and one Humanistic synagogue.[156] Muslims have been increasing in Alabama, with 31 mosques built by 2011, many by African-American converts.[157] Several Hindu temples and cultural centers in the state have been founded by Indian immigrants and their descendants, the best-known being the Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Birmingham, the Hindu Temple and Cultural Center of Birmingham in Pelham, the Hindu Cultural Center of North Alabama in Capshaw, and the Hindu Mandir and Cultural Center in Tuscaloosa.[158][159] There are six Dharma centers and organizations for Theravada Buddhists.[160] Most monastic Buddhist temples are concentrated in southern Mobile County, near Bayou La Batre. This area has attracted an influx of refugees from Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam during the 1970s and thereafter.[161] The four temples within a ten-mile radius of Bayou La Batre, include Chua Chanh Giac, Wat Buddharaksa, and Wat Lao Phoutthavihan.[162][163][164] The first community of adherents of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Alabama was founded in 1896 by Paul K. Dealy, who moved from Chicago to Fairhope. Bah√° º√≠ centers in Alabama exist in Birmingham, Huntsville, and Florence.[165] In 2018, life expectancy in Alabama was 75.1 years, below the national average of 78.7 years and is the third lowest life expectancy in the country. Factors that can cause lower life expectancy are maternal mortality, suicide, and gun crimes.[166] A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study in 2008 showed that obesity in Alabama is a problem, with most counties having more than 29% of adults obese, except for ten which had a rate between 26% and 29%.[167] Residents of the state, along with those in five other states, were least likely in the nation to be physically active during leisure time.[168] Alabama, and the southeastern U.S. in general, has one of the highest incidences of adult onset diabetes in the country, exceeding 10% of adults.[169][170] The state has invested in aerospace, education, health care, banking, and various heavy industries, including automobile manufacturing, mineral extraction, steel production and fabrication. By 2006, crop and animal production in Alabama was valued at $1.5 billion. In contrast to the primarily agricultural economy of the previous century, this was only about one percent of the state's gross domestic product. The number of private farms has declined at a steady rate since the 1960s, as land has been sold to developers, timber companies, and large farming conglomerates.[171] Non-agricultural employment in 2008 was 121,800 in management occupations; 71,750 in business and financial operations; 36,790 in computer-related and mathematical occupation; 44,200 in architecture and engineering; 12,410 in life, physical, and social sciences; 32,260 in community and social services; 12,770 in legal occupations; 116,250 in education, training, and library services; 27,840 in art, design and media occupations; 121,110 in healthcare; 44,750 in fire fighting, law enforcement, and security; 154,040 in food preparation and serving; 76,650 in building and grounds cleaning and maintenance; 53,230 in personal care and services; 244,510 in sales; 338,760 in office and administration support; 20,510 in farming, fishing, and forestry; 120,155 in construction and mining, gas, and oil extraction; 106,280 in installation, maintenance, and repair; 224,110 in production; and 167,160 in transportation and material moving.[16] According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the 2008 total gross state product was $170 billion, or $29,411 per capita. Alabama's 2012 GDP increased 1.2% from the previous year. The single largest increase came in the area of information.[172] In 2010, per capita income for the state was $22,984.[128] The state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 5.8% in April 2015.[173] This compared to a nationwide seasonally adjusted rate of 5.4%.[174] Alabama has no minimum wage and in February 2016 passed legislation preventing municipalities from setting one. (A Birmingham city ordinance would have raised theirs to $10.10.)[175] As of 2018[update], Alabama has the sixth highest poverty rate among states in the U.S.[176] In 2017, United Nations Special Rapporteur Philip Alston toured parts of rural Alabama and observed environmental conditions he said were poorer than anywhere he had seen in the developed world.[177] The five employers that employed the most employees in Alabama in April 2011 were:[178] The next twenty largest employers, as of 2011[update], included:[179] Alabama's agricultural outputs include poultry and eggs, cattle, fish, plant nursery items, peanuts, cotton, grains such as corn and sorghum, vegetables, milk, soybeans, and peaches. Although known as \"The Cotton State\", Alabama ranks between eighth and tenth in national cotton production, according to various reports,[180][181] with Texas, Georgia and Mississippi comprising the top three. Aquaculture is a large part of the economy of Alabama.[182] Alabamians began to practice aquaculture in the early 1960s.[183] U.S. farm-raised catfish is the 8th most popular seafood product in America.[184] By 2008, approximately 4,000 people in Alabama were employed by the catfish industry and Alabama produced 132 million pounds of catfish.[182] In 2020, Alabama produced 1‚ÅÑ3 of the United States' farm-raised catfish.[184] The total 2020 sales of catfish raised in Alabama equaled $307 million but by 2020 the total employment of Alabamians fell to 2,442.[184] From the early 2000s to 2020, the Alabamian catfish industry has declined from 250 farms and 4 processors to 66 farms and 2 processors.[184] Reasons for this decline include increased feed prices, catfish alternatives, COVID-19's impact on restaurant sales, disease, and fish size.[184] Alabama's industrial outputs include iron and steel products (including cast-iron and steel pipe); paper, lumber, and wood products; mining (mostly coal); plastic products; cars and trucks; and apparel. In addition, Alabama produces aerospace and electronic products, mostly in the Huntsville area, the location of NASA's George C. Marshall Space Flight Center and the U.S. Army Materiel Command, headquartered at Redstone Arsenal. A great deal of Alabama's economic growth since the 1990s has been due to the state's expanding automotive manufacturing industry. Located in the state are Honda Manufacturing of Alabama, Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama, Mercedes-Benz U.S. International, and Toyota Motor Manufacturing Alabama, as well as their various suppliers. Since 1993, the automobile industry has generated more than 67,800 new jobs in the state. Alabama currently ranks 4th in the nation for vehicle exports.[185] Automakers accounted for approximately a third of the industrial expansion in the state in 2012.[186] The eight models produced at the state's auto factories totaled combined sales of 74,335 vehicles for 2012. The strongest model sales during this period were the Hyundai Elantra compact car, the Mercedes-Benz GL-Class sport utility vehicle and the Honda Ridgeline sport utility truck.[187] Steel producers Outokumpu, Nucor, SSAB, ThyssenKrupp, and U.S. Steel have facilities in Alabama and employ more than 10,000 people. In May 2007, German steelmaker ThyssenKrupp selected Calvert in Mobile County for a 4.65 billion combined stainless and carbon steel processing facility.[188] ThyssenKrupp's stainless steel division, Inoxum, including the stainless portion of the Calvert plant, was sold to Finnish stainless steel company Outokumpu in 2012.[189] The remaining portion of the ThyssenKrupp plant had final bids submitted by ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel for $1.6 billion in March 2013. Companhia Sider√∫rgica Nacional submitted a combined bid for the mill at Calvert, plus a majority stake in the ThyssenKrupp mill in Brazil, for $3.8 billion.[190] In July 2013, the plant was sold to ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel.[191] The Hunt Refining Company, a subsidiary of Hunt Consolidated, Inc., is based in Tuscaloosa and operates a refinery there. The company also operates terminals in Mobile, Melvin, and Moundville.[192] JVC America, Inc. operates an optical disc replication and packaging plant in Tuscaloosa.[193] The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company operates a large plant in Gadsden which employs about 1,400 people. It has been in operation since 1929. Construction of an Airbus A320 family aircraft assembly plant in Mobile was formally announced by Airbus CEO Fabrice Br√©gier from the Mobile Convention Center on July 2, 2012. The plans include a $600 million factory at the Brookley Aeroplex for the assembly of the A319, A320 and A321 aircraft. Construction began in 2013, with plans for it to become operable by 2015 and produce up to 50 aircraft per year by 2017.b[194][195] The assembly plant is the company's first factory to be built within the United States.[196] It was announced on February 1, 2013, that Airbus had hired Alabama-based Hoar Construction to oversee construction of the facility.[197] The factory officially opened on September 14, 2015, covering one million square feet on 53 acres of flat grassland.[198] According to Business Insider, Alabama ranked 14th in most popular states to visit in 2014.[199] An estimated 26 million tourists visited the state in 2017 and spent $14.3 billion, providing directly or indirectly 186,900 jobs in the state,[200] which includes 362,000 International tourists spending $589 million.[201] The state is home to various attractions, natural features, parks and events that attract visitors from around the globe, notably the annual Hangout Music Festival, held on the public beaches of Gulf Shores; the Alabama Shakespeare Festival, one of the ten largest Shakespeare festivals in the world;[202] the Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail, a collection of championship caliber golf courses distributed across the state; casinos such as Victoryland; amusement parks such as Alabama Splash Adventure; the Riverchase Galleria, one of the largest shopping centers in the southeast; Guntersville Lake, voted the best lake in Alabama by Southern Living Magazine readers;[203] and the Alabama Museum of Natural History, the oldest museum in the state.[204] Mobile is known for having the oldest organized Mardi Gras celebration in the United States, beginning in 1703.[205] It was also host to the first formally organized Mardi Gras parade in the U.S. in 1830, a tradition that continues to this day.[205] Mardi Gras is an official state holiday in Mobile and Baldwin counties.[206] In 2018, Mobile's Mardi Gras parade was the state's top event, producing the most tourists with an attendance of 892,811. The top attraction was the U.S. Space & Rocket Center in Huntsville with an attendance of 849,981, followed by the Birmingham Zoo with 543,090. Of the parks and natural destinations, Alabama's Gulf Coast topped the list with 6,700,000 visitors.[207] Alabama has historically been a popular region for film shoots due to its diverse landscapes and contrast of environments.[208] Movies filmed in Alabama include Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Get Out, 42, Selma, Big Fish, The Final Destination, Due Date, and Need for Speed.[209] UAB Hospital, USA Health University Hospital, Huntsville Hospital, and Children's Hospital of Alabama are the only Level I trauma centers in Alabama.[210] UAB is the largest state government employer in Alabama, with a workforce of about 18,000.[211] A 2017 study found that Alabama had the least competitive health insurance market in the country, with Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama having a market share of 84% followed by UnitedHealth Group at 7%.[212] Regions Financial Corporation is the largest bank headquartered in or operating in Alabama. PNC Financial Services and Wells Fargo also have a major presence in Alabama.[213] Wells Fargo has a regional headquarters, an operations center campus, and a $400 million data center in Birmingham. Many smaller banks are also headquartered in the Birmingham area, including ServisFirst and New South Federal Savings Bank. Birmingham also serves as the headquarters for several large investment management companies, including Harbert Management Corporation. Telecommunications provider AT&T, formerly BellSouth, has a major presence in Alabama with several large offices in Birmingham. Many technology companies are headquartered in Huntsville, such as ADTRAN, a network access company; Intergraph, a computer graphics company; and Avocent, an IT infrastructure company. Brasfield & Gorrie, BE&K, Hoar Construction, and B.L. Harbert International, based in Alabama and subsidiaries of URS Corporation, are all routinely are included in the Engineering News-Record lists of top design, international construction, and engineering firms. The foundational document for Alabama's government is the Alabama Constitution, the current one having been adopted in 2022. The former Alabama constitution adopted in 1901 was, with over 850 amendments and almost 87,000 words, by some accounts the world's longest constitution and roughly forty times the length of the United States Constitution.[214][215][216][217] There has been a significant movement to rewrite and modernize Alabama's constitution.[218] Critics have argued that Alabama's constitution maintains highly centralized power with the state legislature, leaving practically no power in local hands. Most counties do not have home rule. Any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. The former constitution was particularly criticized for its complexity and length intentionally codifying segregation and racism. Alabama's government is divided into three coequal branches. The legislative branch is the Alabama Legislature, a bicameral assembly composed of the Alabama House of Representatives, with 105 members, and the Alabama Senate, with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation. The Republican Party currently holds a majority in both houses of the Legislature. The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto). Until 1964, the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county, with one per county. It had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901; as a result, urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented. It had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses, either. In Reynolds v. Sims (1964), the U.S. Supreme Court implemented the principle of \"one man, one vote\", ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses (as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented.) Further, the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population, as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems. At that time, Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting, as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts. This had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas. For instance, Birmingham and Jefferson County taxes had supplied one-third of the state budget, but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of state services in funding. Through the legislative delegations, the Alabama legislature kept control of county governments. The executive branch is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws. It is headed by the governor of Alabama. Other members of the executive branch include the cabinet, the lieutenant governor of Alabama, the Attorney General of Alabama, the Alabama Secretary of State, the Alabama State Treasurer, and the State Auditor of Alabama. The current governor is Republican Kay Ivey. The members of the Legislature take office immediately after the November elections. Statewide officials, such as the governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, and other constitutional officers, take office the following January.[219] The judiciary is responsible for interpreting the Constitution of Alabama and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases. The state's highest court is the Supreme Court of Alabama. Alabama uses partisan elections to select judges. Since the 1980s judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized.[220] The current chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court is Republican Tom Parker. All sitting justices on the Alabama Supreme Court are members of the Republican Party. There are two intermediate appellate courts, the Court of Civil Appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeals, and four trial courts: the circuit court (trial court of general jurisdiction), and the district, probate, and municipal courts.[220] Alabama has the death penalty with authorized methods of execution that include the electric chair and the gas chamber.[221] Some critics believe the election of judges has contributed to an exceedingly high rate of executions.[222] Alabama has the highest per capita death penalty rate in the country. In some years, it imposes more death sentences than does Texas, a state which has a population five times larger.[223] However, executions per capita are significantly higher in Texas.[224] Some of its cases have been highly controversial; the U.S. Supreme Court has overturned[225] 24 convictions in death penalty cases.[citation needed] It was the only state to allow judges to override jury decisions in whether or not to use a death sentence; in 10 cases judges overturned sentences of life imprisonment without parole that were voted unanimously by juries.[223] This judicial authority was removed in April 2017.[226] On May 14, 2019, Alabama passed the Human Life Protection Act, banning abortion at any stage of pregnancy unless there is a \"serious health risk\", with no exceptions for rape and incest. The law subjects doctors who perform abortions with 10 to 99 years imprisonment.[227] The law was originally supposed to take effect the following November, but on October 29, 2019, U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson blocked the law from taking effect due to it being in conflict with the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade.[228] On June 24, 2022, after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, Judge Thompson lifted the injunction, allowing the law to go into effect.[229] Alabama is one of the few states that does not allow the creation of state lotteries.[230] Taxes are collected by the Alabama Department of Revenue.[231] Alabama levies a 2%, 4%, or 5% personal income tax, depending on the amount earned and filing status.[232] Taxpayers are allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their Alabama state tax, even if taking the standard deduction; those who itemize can also deduct FICA (the Social Security and Medicare tax).[233] The state's general sales tax rate is 4%.[234] Sales tax rates for cities and counties are also added to purchases.[235] For example, the total sales tax rate in Mobile County, Alabama is 10% and there is an additional restaurant tax of 1%, which means a diner in Mobile County, Alabama would pay an 11% tax on a meal. In 2020, sales and excise taxes in Alabama accounted for 38% of all state and local revenue.[236] Only Alabama, Mississippi, and South Dakota tax groceries at the full state sales tax rate.[237] The corporate income tax rate in Alabama is 6.5%. The overall federal, state, and local tax burden in Alabama ranks the state as the second least tax-burdened state in the country.[238] Property taxes of .40% of assessed value per year, are the second-lowest in the U.S., after Hawaii.[239] The state constitution currently requires a voter referendum to raise property taxes. Historically, an Alabama excise tax \"on the storage, use or other consumption in this state of tangible personal property purchased at retail for storage, use or other consumption in this state\" was the focus of a 1941 U S Supreme Court ruling, Curry v United States.[240] Alabama has 67 counties. Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the county commission. It also has limited executive authority in the county. Because of the constraints of the Alabama Constitution, which centralizes power in the state legislature, only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have limited home rule. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved, ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning. The state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing home rule for counties, as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission.[241] Legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county. United States Supreme Court decisions in Baker v. Carr (1964) required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population, and redistricted after each census, to implement the principle of \"one man, one vote\". Before that, each county was represented by one state senator, leading to under-representation in the state senate for more urbanized, populous counties. The rural bias of the state legislature, which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house, affected politics well into the 20th century, failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas. \"The lack of home rule for counties in Alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution. Alabama's constitution has been amended more than 700 times, and almost one-third of the amendments are local in nature, applying to only one county or city. A significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation, taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance.\"[241] Alabama is an alcoholic beverage control state, meaning the state government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol. The Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the state. A total of 25 of the 67 counties are \"dry counties\" which ban the sale of alcohol, and there are many dry municipalities in counties which permit alcohol sales.[242] During Reconstruction following the American Civil War, Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the Third Military District under General John Pope. In 1874, the political coalition of white Democrats known as the Redeemers took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the black vote through violence, fraud, and intimidation. After 1890, a coalition of White Democratic politicians passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise African American residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor Whites. By 1941 more Whites than Blacks had been disenfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000. The total effects were greater on the black community, as almost all its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law. From 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas. As counties were the basis of election districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three-quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation. Alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the civil rights movement, when whites bureaucratically, and at times violently, resisted protests for electoral and social reform. Governor George Wallace, the state's only four-term governor, was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation. Only after passage of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964[77] and Voting Rights Act of 1965 did African Americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage, among other civil rights. In many jurisdictions, they continued to be excluded from representation by at-large electoral systems, which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections. Some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish single-member districts that enable a more diverse representation among county boards. In 2007, the Alabama Legislature passed, and Republican governor Bob Riley signed a resolution expressing \"profound regret\" over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the Alabama State Capitol, which housed Congress of the Confederate States of America.[243] In 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years.[244] As of February 2023[update], there are a total of 3,707,233 registered voters, with 3,318,679 active, and the others inactive in the state.[245] The 2023 American Values Atlas by Public Religion Research Institute found that a majority of Alabama residents support same-sex marriage.[246] With the disfranchisement of Blacks in 1901, the state became part of the \"Solid South\", a system in which the Democratic Party operated as effectively the only viable political party in every Southern state. For nearly a hundred years local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party primary, with generally only token Republican challengers running in the general election. Since the mid- to late 20th century, however, white conservatives started shifting to the Republican Party. In Alabama, majority-white districts are now expected to regularly elect Republican candidates to federal, state and local office. Members of the nine seats on the Supreme Court of Alabama[247] and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office. Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats. In that general election, the then-incumbent chief justice, Ernest C. Hornsby, refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to Republican Perry O. Hooper Sr.[248] Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court.[249] The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August 2011 with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench. In the early 21st century, Republicans hold all seven of the statewide elected executive branch offices. Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the Alabama State Board of Education. In 2010, Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature, giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years. The last remaining statewide Democrat, who served on the Alabama Public Service Commission, was defeated in 2012.[250][251][252] Only three Republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of Reconstruction, when Republicans generally represented Reconstruction government, including the newly emancipated freedmen who had gained the franchise. The three GOP lieutenant governors are Steve Windom (1999‚Äì2003), Kay Ivey (2011‚Äì2017), and Will Ainsworth (2019‚Äìpresent). Many local offices (county commissioners, boards of education, tax assessors, mayors, etc.) in the state are still held by Democrats.[253][254] Many metropolitan and suburban counties have voters who are majority Democrats, resulting in local elections being decided in the Democratic primary. Similarly most rural counties are majority-Republican and elections are effectively decided in the Republican Primary. However, since local governments in Alabama are weaker than in other parts of the country, Republicans have the upper hand in government. Alabama's 67 county sheriffs are elected in partisan, at-large races, and Republicans retain the vast majority of those posts. The current split is 18 Democrats, and 49 Republicans as of 2023. However, most of the Democratic sheriffs preside over urban and more populated counties. The majority of Republican sheriffs have been elected in the more rural counties with lower population. The state of Alabama has and 11 African-American sheriffs.[255] The state's two U.S. senators are Katie Britt and Tommy Tuberville, both of whom are Republican. In the U.S. House of Representatives, the state is represented by seven members, six of whom are Republicans (Jerry Carl, Mike Rogers, Robert Aderholt, Dale Strong, Barry Moore, and Gary Palmer) and one Democrat Terri Sewell, who represents the Black Belt as well as most of the predominantly black portions of Birmingham, Tuscaloosa and Montgomery. Public primary and secondary education in Alabama is under the purview of the Alabama State Board of Education as well as local oversight by 67 county school boards and 60 city boards of education. Together, 1,496 individual schools provide education for 744,637 elementary and secondary students.[256] Public school funding is appropriated through the Alabama Legislature through the Education Trust Fund. In FY 2006‚Äì2007, Alabama appropriated $3,775,163,578 for primary and secondary education. That represented an increase of $444,736,387 over the previous fiscal year. In 2007, more than 82 percent of schools made adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward student proficiency under the National No Child Left Behind law, using measures determined by the state of Alabama. While Alabama's public education system has improved in recent decades, it lags behind in achievement compared to other states. According to U.S. Census data (2000), Alabama's high school graduation rate (75%) is the fourth lowest in the U.S. (after Kentucky, Louisiana and Mississippi).[257] The largest educational gains were among people with some college education but without degrees.[258] According to National Assessment of Educational Progress (NEAP), Alabama ranks 39 in reading and 40 in math among fourth-grade students in the rankings from 2022.[259] Generally prohibited in the West at large, school corporal punishment is not unusual in Alabama, with 27,260 public school students paddled at least one time, according to government data for the 2011‚Äì2012 school year.[c][260] The rate of school corporal punishment in Alabama is surpassed by only Mississippi and Arkansas.[260] Alabama's programs of higher education include 14 four-year public universities, two-year community colleges, and 17 private, undergraduate and graduate universities. In the state are four medical schools (as of fall 2015) UAB Heersink School of Medicine, University of South Alabama and Alabama College of Osteopathic Medicine and The Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine‚ÄîAuburn Campus), two veterinary colleges (Auburn University and Tuskegee University), a dental school (UAB School of Dentistry, an optometry college (UAB School of Optometry), two pharmacy schools (Auburn University and Samford University), and five law schools (University of Alabama School of Law, Birmingham School of Law, Cumberland School of Law, Miles Law School, and the Thomas Goode Jones School of Law). Public, post-secondary education in Alabama is overseen by the Alabama Commission on Higher Education and the Alabama Department of Postsecondary Education. Colleges and universities in Alabama offer degree programs from two-year associate degrees to a multitude of doctoral level programs.[261] The largest single campus is the University of Alabama, located in Tuscaloosa, with 37,665 enrolled for fall 2016.[262] Troy University was the largest institution in the state in 2010, with an enrollment of 29,689 students across four Alabama campuses (Troy, Dothan, Montgomery, and Phenix City), as well as sixty learning sites in seventeen other states and eleven other countries. The oldest institutions are the public University of North Alabama in Florence and the Catholic Church-affiliated Spring Hill College in Mobile, both founded in 1830.[263][264] Accreditation of academic programs is through the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) as well as other subject-focused national and international accreditation agencies such as the Association for Biblical Higher Education (ABHE),[265] the Council on Occupational Education (COE),[266] and the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS).[267] According to the 2024 U.S. News & World Report, Alabama had three universities ranked in the top 100 Public Schools in America (Auburn University at 47, University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) at 76, and University of Alabama at 91).[268] According to the 2024 U.S. News & World Report, Alabama had four tier one universities (Auburn University, University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), University of Alabama and University of Alabama in Huntsville).[269] Major newspapers include Birmingham News, Mobile Press-Register, and Montgomery Advertiser.[270] Major television network affiliates in Alabama include: Alabama literature is characterized by themes of race and issues of gender and war, and is influenced by events such as the American Civil War, the Reconstruction era, the Civil Rights Movement, and the Vietnam War. Some notable examples of Alabama literature include Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird, Winston Groom's Forrest Gump, Fannie Flagg's Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistlestop Cafe, and the biographies of Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. Alabama has several professional and semi-professional sports teams, including three minor league baseball teams. The Talladega Superspeedway motorsports complex hosts a series of NASCAR events. It has a seating capacity of 143,000 and is the thirteenth largest stadium in the world and sixth largest stadium in America. Also, the Barber Motorsports Park has hosted IndyCar Series and Rolex Sports Car Series races. The ATP Birmingham was a World Championship Tennis tournament held from 1973 to 1980. Alabama has hosted several professional golf tournaments, such as the 1984 and 1990 PGA Championship at Shoal Creek, the Barbasol Championship (PGA Tour), the Mobile LPGA Tournament of Champions, Airbus LPGA Classic, and Yokohama Tire LPGA Classic (LPGA Tour), and The Tradition (Champions Tour). College football is extremely popular in Alabama, particularly the University of Alabama Crimson Tide and Auburn University Tigers, rivals in the Southeastern Conference. Alabama averages over 100,000 fans per game and Auburn averages over 80,000‚Äîboth numbers among the top twenty in the nation.[272] Bryant‚ÄìDenny Stadium is the home of the Alabama football team, and has a seating capacity of 101,821,[273] and is the fifth largest stadium in America.[274] Jordan-Hare Stadium is the home field of the Auburn football team and seats up to 87,451.[275] Protective Stadium is home of the UAB Blazers football program and the Birmingham Bowl. It seats 45,000.[276] Ladd‚ÄìPeebles Stadium in Mobile is the home of the University of South Alabama football team, and serves as the home of the NCAA Senior Bowl, LendingTree Bowl, and Alabama-Mississippi All Star Classic; the stadium seats 40,646.[277] In 2009, Bryant‚ÄìDenny Stadium and Jordan-Hare Stadium became the homes of the Alabama High School Athletic Association state football championship games, after previously being held at Legion Field in Birmingham.[278] Major airports with sustained operations in Alabama include Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport (BHM), Huntsville International Airport (HSV), Dothan Regional Airport (DHN), Mobile Regional Airport (MOB), Montgomery Regional Airport (MGM), Northwest Alabama Regional Airport (MSL) and Northeast Alabama Regional Airport (GAD). For rail transport, Amtrak schedules the Crescent, a daily passenger train, running from New York to New Orleans with station stops at Anniston, Birmingham, and Tuscaloosa. Alabama has six major interstate routes: Interstate 65 (I-65) travels north‚Äìsouth roughly through the middle of the state; I-20/I-59 travel from the central west Mississippi state line to Birmingham, where I-59 continues to the north-east corner of the state and I-20 continues east towards Atlanta; I-85 originates in Montgomery and travels east-northeast to the Georgia state line, providing a main thoroughfare to Atlanta; and I-10 traverses the southernmost portion of the state, traveling from west to east through Mobile. I-22 enters the state from Mississippi and connects Birmingham with Memphis, Tennessee. In addition, there are currently five auxiliary interstate routes in the state: I-165 in Mobile, I-359 in Tuscaloosa, I-459 around Birmingham, I-565 in Decatur and Huntsville, and I-759 in Gadsden. A sixth route, I-685, will be formed when I-85 is rerouted along a new southern bypass of Montgomery. A proposed northern bypass of Birmingham will be designated as I-422. Since a direct connection from I-22 to I-422 will not be possible, I-222 has been proposed, as well. Several U.S. Highways also pass through the state, such as U.S. Route 11 (US-11), US-29, US-31, US-43, US-45, US-72, US-78, US-80, US-82, US-84, US-90, US-98, US-231, US-278, US-280, US-331, US-411, and US-431. There are four toll roads in the state: Montgomery Expressway in Montgomery; Northport/Tuscaloosa Western Bypass in Tuscaloosa and Northport; Emerald Mountain Expressway in Wetumpka; and Beach Express in Orange Beach. The Port of Mobile, Alabama's only saltwater port, is a large seaport on the Gulf of Mexico with inland waterway access to the Midwest by way of the Tennessee‚ÄìTombigbee Waterway. The Port of Mobile was ranked 12th by tons of traffic in the United States during 2009.[279] The newly expanded container terminal at the Port of Mobile was ranked as the 25th busiest for container traffic in the nation during 2011.[280] The state's other ports are on rivers with access to the Gulf of Mexico.
