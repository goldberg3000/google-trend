                "content": "Acclaimed period epic \"The Brutalist\" cemented its place as an Oscar frontrunner while the Spanish-language musical crime thriller \"Emilia Pérez\" did wonders for its awards-season chances Sunday at the 82nd Golden Globes. At the first major event of awards season, \"Emilia Pérez\" won four Golden Globes including best comedy/musical, non-English-language film, original song and supporting actress for Zoe Saldaña while \"The Brutalist\" picked up a trio of honors, including best drama, best actor for Adrien Brody and best director for Brady Corbet. \"I'm Still Here\" star Fernanda Torres was a surprise winner in the best drama actress category, Sebastian Stan took the best comedy actor trophy and Demi Moore was named best comedy/musical actress for horror movie \"The Substance.\" Here are all the major winners, biggest moments and red carpet highlights from this year's Golden Globes. Join our Watch Party! Sign up to receive USA TODAY's movie and TV recommendations right in your inbox. Finally, the big prizes of the night! \"The Brutalist\" is named best drama – which it is, since it topped this movie critic's top 10 list of 2024. \"I'm incredibly moved,\" says co-writer/director Brady Corbet, thanking those who stuck with it \"as it kept falling apart.\" He was told it was undistributable, that nobody would see it. \"I don't resent that, but I want to use that as an opportunity to lift up ... Films don't exist without the filmmakers. Let's prop them up.\" Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle. Then it's time for \"Emilia Pérez\" to shine again, winning best comedy or musical. \"The light always wins over darkness,\" star Karla Sofía Gascón says in an impassioned speech. \"You can maybe put us in jail, you can beat us up, but you can never take away our soul, our existence, our identity. ... I am who I am, not who you want.\" Whoa! Brazilian actress Fernanda Torres pulls a heck of an upset, winning for best drama actress for \"I'm Still Here\" over Angelina Jolie (\"Maria\") and Nicole Kidman (\"Babygirl\"). \"So many actresses here that I admire so much,\" Torres says, dedicating the honor to her mother, Fernanda Montenegro, herself a previous Golden Globe nominee. But then a more predictable pick, as Adrien Brody gets best drama actor for \"The Brutalist.\" \"I'm deeply humbled by this,\" he says. Brody says his movie is about \"the human capacity for creation\" so he shouts out his fellow actors \"who reach such heights with their work.\" He also thanks his parents, pointing out his mom's artistry and praising his dad for being \"the foundation for this family. All the love I receive flows back to you.\" Notch another couple for \"Shōgun,\" as Emmy winner Anna Sawai gets best drama actress and the FX epic snags best TV drama. She thanks Globes voters, \"even though I would vote for Kathy Bates any day,\" she admits with a smile. Netflix's \"Baby Reindeer\" is named best limited series, which isn't a shocker considering how much of a viral, word-of-mouth hit that was. \"This is insane. 'The Rock' is there! I grew up with you, that's nuts,\" creator/star (and admitted pro-wrestling fan) Richard Gadd says, thanking people for embracing his dark, \"messed-up\" story. And the award for best TV comedy series goes to \"Hacks,\" which also won the category for its first season. (\"Abbott Elementary\" and \"The Bear\" won the past two years.) \"Hey, Dwayne,\" Vin Diesel says to his \"Fast and Furious\" frenemy \"The Rock\" when he comes out to give the Globe for its newest category, best cinematic and box-office achievement. The first winner a year ago was \"Barbie\" and this year it's \"Wicked.\" Which is interesting because it's not even the top money-earner of 2024. (It ranks No. 3 behind \"Inside Out 2\" and \"Deadpool & Wolverine.\") \"This is for you, the fans,\" \"Wicked\" director Jon M. Chu says, adding that even with much pessimism in the world, \"we can still make art that's a radical act of optimism.\" Elton John and Brandi Carlile hit the stage for some jokes and to present a few movie music awards. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' thumping electronica in \"Challengers\" wins for original score – somehow beating \"The Brutalist\"! – while \"El Mal\" from \"Emilia Pérez,\" the showstopper for Zoe Saldaña, is named best original song. (That's No. 3 for \"Emilia.\") Here's another shocker: \"Flow,\" a wordless film from Latvia about a cat surviving in a post-apocalyptic landscape, wins for best animated feature and beats out the higher-profile movies like \"The Wild Robot\" and \"Moana 2.\" Next up is the best director Globe, which goes to \"The Brutalist\" filmmaker (and now first-time winner) Brady Corbet. He says he's \"humbled\" to be in the category with fellow talented directors and Corbet's going to be a name you'll see mentioned a lot this Oscar season. He also mentions that \"his heart\" is with actress Aubrey Plaza and indie director Jeff Baena's family in the wake of Baena's death this weekend. \"A Different Man\" star Sebastian Stan asks for folks to champion movies about \"tough subject matters\" and for normalizing disfigurement in his acceptance speech for best actor in a comedy or musical. A win here definitely helps his standing in a crowded Oscar best actor field. Wow, it's tonight's first big surprise: Demi Moore wins best actress in a musical or comedy for horror movie \"The Substance.\" \"I'm just in shock right now. I've been doing this for a long time, 40 years now and this is the first time I've won anything as an actor,\" Moore says. She once was called \"a popcorn actress\" and bought into that back in the day, but she points to the \"Substance\" script giving her career new life. \"I celebrate this as a marker for my wholeness ... and a reminder that I do belong.\" This helps cement her best actress Oscar spot – but could she win there, too? (That would be awesome.) Someone check on Batman, folks. As the villainous title gangster, \"The Penguin\" star Colin Farrell wins for best male actor in a limited series. He spent three hours every morning \"drinking black coffee and listening to '80s music\" as makeup artist Mike Marino turned him into the Penguin. \"I guess it's prosthetics from here on out,\" Farrell quips. Then Jodie Foster gets best female actor in a limited series for \"True Detective: Night Country.\" \"The greatest thing about this age and being in this time is having a community,\" she says. Make that two for \"Emilia\": The Netflix musical crime thriller wins for best non-English language movie. Not only is it likely an Oscar best-picture contender but it's a favorite going into the international film category as well. Through a translator, French director Jacques Audiard says he hopes the movie is \"a beacon of light\" for those worried about the state of the world. Nate Bargatze, an extremely funny guy who really should host an award show one of these days, presents the Globe for best stand-up TV comedy performance. Ali Wong wins out over Adam Sandler, Seth Meyers and Jamie Foxx with her special \"Single Lady.\" Jeremy Allen White wins best TV comedy actor for \"The Bear\" but he's not there to accept – probably because of his commitments playing \"The Boss\" in that Bruce Springsteen biopic. But Peter Straughan is in the house, getting his first screenplay win for \"Conclave.\" The papal thriller is a serious best picture contender, and beat out \"The Brutalist\" and \"Anora\" in the Globes category. After Nikki Glaser does a musical bit mashing up \"Conclave\" and \"Wicked\" (\"Pope-ular, you're gonna be \"pope-ular\"), Jessica Gunning snags a supporting TV actress award for Netflix's \"Baby Reindeer.\" She says \"I can't believe this is happening to me\" has been her mantra this entire year after the success of the popular miniseries. \"I know 8-year-old me would be chuffed a bit.\" Then \"Shōgun\" nabs its second Globe of the night, with Tadanobu Asano taking home the supporting TV actor trophy. \"Wow! So maybe you don't know me. I'm an actor from Japan,\" he says excitedly. Asano goes back to filming tomorrow, and \"this is very big present for me!\" \"Shōgun\" cleaned up at the Emmys and it continues its domination tonight at the Golden Globes. Hiroyuki Sanada wins for best actor in a TV drama series. \"All of you have brought me here,\" he says, adding some advice to younger actors: \"Be yourself, believe in yourself and never give up.\" Kieran Culkin looks like he could be a lock for Oscar gold, y'all. \"This is incredible,\" the \"A Real Pain\" star says in his acceptance speech after doing a tequila shot with his wife and Mario Lopez. He wins for best supporting actor, and after nonstop kudos thus far this awards season, Culkin's likely to run the table. \"I never thought I'd be so glad to be called a hack,\" says Jean Smart, who follows her Emmy win for \"Hacks\" with a Golden Globe for best actress performance in a TV comedy. This year's race to Oscar supporting actress looks like a dead heat between Zoe Saldaña of \"Emilia Pérez\" and Ariana Grande of \"Wicked.\" Score the first round to Saldaña, who picks up the Globe win – the first award of the night. \"My heart is full of gratitude,\" a tearful Saldaña says in her acceptance speech. New host Nikki Glaser welcomes us to the Globes, \"aka Ozempic's biggest night.\" Unlike her viral Tom Brady take down, the standup comedian announces she's not here to roast anyone: \"You could really do anything, except tell the country who to vote for,\" she says about the A-listers in attendance. \"You'll get them next time. If there's a next time. Ariana, hold my finger,\" she adds, pointing out Ariana Grande. She gives a shoutout to servers and \"two-time Holocaust\" survivor\" Adrien Brody, makes a Diddy joke involving Stanley Tucci, and points out all the movie stars doing TV, like Cate Blanchett, Colin Farrell and Eddie Redmayne, who stars in \"The Day of the Jackal. \"It's about a spy no one can find because he's on Peacock,\" she quips. Glaser takes special note goofing on Timothée Chalamet, from how his name sounds like something Adam Sandler would say (which makes Sandler pop up to say it in a very Sandler way) to the actor's Bob Dylan voice and facial hair: \"You have the most gorgeous eyelashes on your upper lip.\" Overall, a pretty good job – and way better than Jo Koy last year! This year’s Globes guest list included two Glen Powells — one who’s nominated for “Hit Man” and another one who actually goes by Maxwell in his day-to-day life. Max Braunstein won Austin’s Glen Powell lookalike contest and arrived midway through the red carpet with Miles Mitchell, aka the New York City Timothée Chalamet lookalike contest winner. Both men brandished signs that read “I won a lookalike contest and now I’m at the Golden Globes.” Their handler said the contest winners’ attendance was courtesy of CBS, the network broadcasting the award show. The biggest blockbuster crashing this Oscar season is \"Wicked,\" which has amassed a $443.8 million domestic haul so far since November – good enough to be the No. 3 movie of 2024. We'll have to wait and see if an Oscar best picture nomination in store, but \"Wicked\" has a good chance of beating out \"Anora\" for best comedy/musical while Ariana Grande is a best bet for supporting actress. See more of our predictions here. Grande hit the Globes red carpet with a new hair color, a light brown dye job compared to her blonde Glinda locks, and was spotted hugging Miley Cyrus while in conversation with Sarah Paulson. Netflix's \"Emilia Pérez\" is up for 10 Globes but the most significant is in best actress in a comedy/musical. Karla Sofía Gascón has already made history as the first trans actor to be nominated in a film category and would mark another milestone if she were to win. (Fun fact: In 2022, \"Pose\" star Michaela Jaé Rodriguez became the first trans woman to win a Globe.) Gascón is also predicted to be the first trans woman to earn a best actress Oscar nomination, a possibility she talked with USA TODAY about in November: “It would be absolutely wonderful and a real source of pride.\" OK, so Globe trophies are handed out tonight. But it's just the beginning for both winners and losers on the road to the Academy Awards. The next stop? Wednesday morning, when nominations for the Screen Actors Guild Awards will be announced. Here are the rest of the important upcoming events and dates for awards watchers: Sunday's a big night for four-time Globe nominee Timothée Chalamet: He's in two contenders for best drama – the Bob Dylan biopic \"A Complete Unknown\" and sci-fi sequel \"Dune: Part Two\" – and is also up for a best actor Globe for playing Dylan. However, he'll likely get bested by \"The Brutalist\" standout Adrien Brody in a stacked category. It's not the Avengers but the Globes put together a superhero team to hand out trophies Sunday night, including Batman, Spider-Man, Captain America, Wonder Woman, Ghost Rider, Catwoman and the Penguin – or, as they're known off-screen, Michael Keaton, Andrew Garfield, Anthony Mackie, Gal Gadot, Nicolas Cage, Zoë Kravitz and Colin Farrell. \"The Substance\" co-stars Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley and \"Moana 2\" pair Dwayne Johnson and Auliʻi Cravalho will also be on hand to present honors alongside fellow luminaries like Colman Domingo, Anya Taylor-Joy, Ariana DeBose, Elton John, Glenn Close, Kerry Washington, Jeff Goldblum, Melissa McCarthy, Michelle Yeoh, Vin Diesel and Viola Davis. The E! network's \"Live From E!: Golden Globes\" special starts at 6 p.m. ET/3 PT, and \"Access Hollywood\" personality Zuri Hall and comedian Heather McMahan are taking over as hosts from the departing Laverne Cox. \"Entertainment Tonight\" and Variety are also co-hosting a digital pre-show (6:30 ET/3:30 PT) that will stream on Penske Media platforms.

If you loved that Netflix roast of Tom Brady, then you might already be a fan of comedian Nikki Glaser, the host of this Sunday's Golden Globes ceremony. She's also skewered Alec Baldwin and Rob Lowe, but Glaser found a new level of viral fame for brutally mocking Brady, an NFL legend, for his divorce from Gisele Bündchen. “The Golden Globes is not only a huge night for TV and film, but also for comedy,\" Glaser said in a statement. She couldn't be any worse than last year's host Jo Koy, who notoriously bombed his Globes opening monologue. Glaser joins a long list of Golden emcees including Ricky Gervais, Jerrod Carmichael, Jimmy Fallon, Seth Meyers, and the dynamic duo of Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. The show will air live on CBS (8 p.m. ET/5 PT) as well as on the CBS app and Paramount+. There is a catch, however: Those with a Paramount+ subscription that includes Showtime can watch the Globes live, while subscribers with the cheaper Paramount+ Essential plan will have to wait until Monday. (It's worth springing for that extra five bucks a month: You get live Globes – woo-hoo! – plus no ads and Showtime series like \"The Agency,\" \"Yellowjackets\" and \"Dexter: Original Sin,\" a nifty 1990s-set prequel to the original \"Dexter.\") Contributing: Marco della Cava, Brendan Morrow, KiMi Robinson, Jay Stahl",

Audiard added, \"In these troubled times, I hope 'Emilia Pérez' will be a beacon of light.\" Other nominees in the category included \"All We Imagine as Light,\" \"The Girl with the Needle,\" \"I'm Still Here,\" \"The Seed of the Sacred Fig\" and \"Vermiglio.\" Colin Farrell won the Golden Globe for best performance by a male actor in a limited series, anthology series or a motion picture made for television for \"The Penguin.\" \"It takes a village, whether it's on the small screen or the big screen. I'm here on the backs of the talents of so many people through the years -- maybe this one more than others,\" he said, shouting out the team that transformed him into Oswald \"Oz\" Cobb on the series. This is Farrell's third Golden Globe win, having previously won for \"In Bruges\" and \"The Banshees of Inisherin.\" Other nominees in the category included Richard Gadd for \"Baby Reindeer,\" Kevin Kline for \"Disclaimer,\" Cooper Koch for \"Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story,\" Ewan McGregor for \"A Gentleman in Moscow\" and Andrew Scott for \"Ripley.\" Ali Wong won the Golden Globe for best performance in stand-up comedy on television for \"Ali Wong: Single Lady.\" Other nominees in the category included Jamie Foxx for \"Jamie Foxx: What Had Happened Was…\", Nikki Glaser for \"Nikki Glaser: Someday You'll Die,\" Seth Meyers for \"Seth Meyers: Dad Man Walking,\" Adam Sandler for \"Adam Sandler: Love You\" and Ramy Youssef for \"Ramy Youssef: More Feelings.\" Peter Straughan won the Golden Globe for best screenplay for \"Conclave.\" \"I am just one pure ball of gratitude squeezed into a tux,\" Straughan said, thanking those involved with the film.

Cairo Santos converted the extra point. The Packers responded with a 37-yard field goal made by Brandon McManus. Chicago led 7-3 after the first quarter. Chicago's lead grew when D'Andre Swift rushed for a 4-yard touchdown. Santos converted the extra point. To make matters worse for Green Bay, Love exited the game due to an elbow injury and was replaced by Malik Willis. However, the hosts fired back with a 9-yard touchdown run from Josh Jacobs and McManus converted the extra point. Green Bay then lessened the deficit further when McManus made a 30-yard field goal. At halftime, the Bears had a narrow 14-13 lead over the Packers. Both teams failed to create big chances in the third quarter, which ended scoreless. The Bears eventually resumed the scoring in the fourth quarter when Williams connected with DJ Moore for a 32-yard touchdown. Santos converted the extra point. The Packers then fought hard to get back into the game and were rewarded when Emanuel Wilson rushed for a 21-yard touchdown. They went for a successful 2-point conversion via Jayden Reed. The Packers thought completed the comeback when McManus made a 55-yard field goal. However, in the final play of the game, Santos made a 51-yard field goal to give the Bears a narrow 24-22 win.

The overall frequency for a given word is calculated by summing frequencies for the main form of the word, any plural or inflected forms, and any major spelling variations. For sets of homographs (distinct entries that share the same word-form, e.g. mole, n.¹, mole, n.², mole, n.³, etc.), we have estimated the frequency of each homograph entry as a fraction of the total Ngrams frequency for the word-form. This may result in inaccuracies. Smoothing has been applied to series for lower-frequency words, using a moving-average algorithm. This reduces short-term fluctuations, which may be produced by variability in the content of the Google Books corpus. * Occurrences per million words in written English Modern frequency series are derived from a corpus of 20 billion words, covering the period from 2017 to the present.

                "content": "More on the Meaning of Patriot The word patriot signifies a person who loves their country and is ready to boldly support and defend it. That meaning has endured since the word's arrival in English in the 16th century, but it has not marched through the years unchallenged. Ultimately derived from Greek patrios, meaning \"of one’s father,\" patriot entered English via French patriote—meaning \"fellow countryman\" or \"compatriot\"—during a time of political unrest in western Europe that was characterized by infighting among fellow countrymen—especially among those of the Protestant and Catholic faiths. For much of the 17th century, words like good were attached to patriot to distinguish patriots who shared both a love of country and a common allegiance from those having opposing beliefs and loyalties: to be deemed a \"good patriot\" was to be a lover of country who agreed on political and/or religious matters with whoever was doing the deeming. The Catholiques were knowne good Patriots under our former Kings. — Henry Hammond, A view of some exceptions which have been made by a Romanist to the Lord Viscount Falkland's discourse…, 1646 Patriot was used to mean \"good patriot\" without modification more frequently by the end of the 17th century, but it tended to apply to a supporter of the ruling monarchy. A Patriot, both the King and Country serves; Prerogative, and Privilege preserves. — John Dryden, Fables, Ancient and Modern, 1700 Another effect of the tumultuous times was the development of a derogatory use of patriot to refer to hypocritical patriots: people who claimed devotion to one's country and government but whose actions or beliefs belied such devotion. This ultimately led to the discrediting of the loyalty and steadfastness associated with the word patriot. The years leading up to the American Revolutionary War further propagated the notion of patriot as a name for a seditious rebel against the monarchy. American writers of the 18th century, however, heartily embraced the word to define the colonists who took action against British control. As tensions continued to escalate, a new meaning of patriot came to the forefront, referring to a person who advocates or promotes the independence of their land or people from the country of which they are a colony. Benjamin Franklin provides an early record of this use. It should be no Wonder … if among so many Thousand true Patriots as New England contains there should be found even Twelve Judases. — Benjamin Franklin, letter, 7 July 1773 In the end, the patriots won the war and, centuries after America’s Declaration of Independence, patriot has held its place of honor in the English language as the meritorious name for the brave men and women of the armed forces who defend the rights and freedoms of their country. Stripped of all past disparagement, the word has returned to its original meaning: \"one who loves his or her country.\" Today, active fighting or resistance is not a requirement to being a patriot: a person only needs a strong sense of love for one’s country.

                "content": "EPL Advertisement live Updated 36m ago Premier League leaders Liverpool had to settle for a point, after Amad’s late goal earned struggling Manchester United an excellent 2-2 draw at Anfield. Lisandro Martinez (52) sprung the visitors ahead before Cody Gakpo (59) and Mohamed Salah (70 pen) turned the game on its head. But Amad (80) prodded home an equaliser, while Harry Maguire smashed an incredible chance over the bar in the final seconds. The defensive performance of Trent Alexander-Arnold, a January transfer target for Real Madrid, attracted criticism but his side remains six points clear at the summit — while United are 13th. GO FURTHER Liverpool 2 Manchester United 2 – Something for everyone in incredible rollercoaster game at Anfield Arne Slot has insisted speculation over Trent Alexander-Arnold’s Liverpool future did not impact his performance against Manchester United. The right-back endured a difficult afternoon in today’s 2-2 draw at Anfield. That came after Real Madrid ramped up their interest in Alexander-Arnold, who is out of contract at the end of the season and now able to sign a pre-contract agreement with foreign clubs. Last week, Liverpool rebuffed an approach from the Spanish giants to sign him in January. Slot said: 💬 “I don’t believe in those things. Nine out of 10 people will say it (the transfer speculation) affected him but I’m one of the 10 that tells you it didn’t affect him. “What affected him is he had to play against Bruno Fernandes and Diogo Dalot — two starters for Portugal who are great players. “We have a fantastic player here in Diogo Jota and he’s mostly not playing for Portugal, so that tells you how much quality United have. “If these players set themselves to a game, that is what United do once in a while, it is very difficult to play against them. “It is more difficult for Trent to play against Bruno Fernandes and Diogo Dalot than it is the rumours in the week. Probably everyone is going to tell you it had to do with the rumours but my opinion is different.” GO FURTHER Trent Alexander-Arnold not affected by Real Madrid speculation, says Liverpool coach Arne Slot Advertisement Getty Images Ruben Amorim and his Manchester United squad have the luxury of a full week to prepare for their next match, which is a lively trip to Arsenal in the FA Cup third round on Sunday. That match begins at 3pm GMT, 10am ET. Following that encounter United host the Premier League’s bottom side, Southampton, on Thursday week before hosting Brighton three days later. Getty Images It is Carabao Cup action up next for Liverpool on Wednesday, as they travel to Tottenham Hotspur for the first leg of their semi-final. That kicks off at 8pm GMT, 3pm ET. After that, they face nearby fourth-tier strugglers Accrington Stanley in the FA Cup third round three days later, before their return to Premier League duties on Tuesday week — and it is a tasty one, at high-flying Nottingham Forest. Getty Images Let’s continue the Discuss tab reaction, now from a Manchester United perspective — and it features the sort of positivity I can’t remember seeing from the fanbase in a long time: 💬 Brian M: “Ugarte my MOTM. After a disrupted start, he is fast becoming a rock that you can build a midfield around. No surprise we are better today with him back shielding the back 3.” 💬 Ashdon M: “Bruno’s played with so much more composure today, I hope he can keep it up as we’re going to need his best to get us firing again. There have been some real positives about our performance.” 💬 F A: “Can you all at least give the players some credit, regardless of result? We are so quick to slate them.” Let’s get reaction from our Discuss tab, starting with Liverpool supporters — although I’m pretty sure that first one isn’t Daniel Sturridge, the former Anfield striker, as he’s still arguing stuff on Sky Sports: 💬 Daniel S: “F*** me, good thing Maguire is s***. Trent lost us the points.” 💬 Max F: “Honestly, one of our worst performances this season. Macca (Mac Allister) the only one playing up to his level. We’re kind of lucky to get out with a draw.” 💬 Pritham M: “A wake-up call for us. Will help us refocus again on the job at hand. We can finally agree letting Trent go is in the best interests of the club. No one is bigger than the club, we need humble and honest players representing us.” Getty Images After his goal from the penalty spot today, Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah has 18 goals and 13 assists from his 19 Premier League games so far this season. That is the most goal involvements (31) by a player in the first half of a Premier League campaign, beating Luis Suarez’s total of 30 (23 goals, seven assists) back in 2013-14 for... Liverpool. Advertisement Speaking to Sky Sports post-match, Liverpool head coach Arne Slot has also defended Trent Alexander-Arnold’s performance against Manchester United. His defending proved a weakness against Diogo Dalot — but perhaps the bigger issue is the context, with Real Madrid having tried their luck in signing the England defender this month. A reminder, the former Liverpool academy player is out of contract in the summer. Slot said: 💬 “Trent has played mostly very good games for the club. Today was not his best game but that had to do with them as well. “Sometimes Ryan (Gravenberch) was not close enough to him, so it was a two-on-one situation. “I would put it more on the quality of (Diogo) Dalot and Bruno Fernandes.” The Athletic Good question. Take a look right here. Liverpool still sitting pretty at the top, and if they win their game in hand the margin could be nine points. Pole position for the Premier League title. As for Manchester United, they now sit 13th. The Athletic A draw felt like a fair result but Liverpool boss Arne Slot is confident he will feel differently to that come tomorrow morning. Here’s what he said to Sky Sports: 💬 “Over the course of the game we created much more chances. But being 1-0 down, then 2-1 up and conceding such a big chance just before the end, also feels maybe a point is something to take. “This was a chance for them, against us, to show themselves more than other games. Now they compete with the best players in the league and you can see how they also have very good players. “Mostly (United were in) a low block, and sometimes they pressed a bit higher than normally I’ve seen them. But they didn’t take the risk of build-up. We weren’t surprised with anything they did. “Bruno Fernandes is a very, very good player and he played a very good game today as well. So they did cause some problems.” Getty Images Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim has been in compelling form after the game — and at times, cutting an almost upset figure. Here is what he said to BBC Sport: 💬 “That should be a big issue for our players, that even one person thinks you have the ability but not the character. We have to fight that and change that. “It is really clear. When we are focused, when we fight for every ball, when we suffer and we are tired when the game is finished, we are a good team. “If we don’t do that all the time then we are going to lose games. That is clear to everybody. “We controlled very well the tempo. Every time Liverpool had a chance, we controlled and had the ball for a moment. That makes a difference. It was not like we are not suffering all the time. It was a good game.” Getty Images There have been a few post-match questions put to Liverpool figures about whether they took things a little lightly against Manchester United — an angle that seems mostly based on the fact everyone expected a hefty defeat for the visitors. The reaction to that question has mostly been to dismiss that idea as just pre-match talk, and it being a long way from Liverpool’s attitude to the game. You all either saw the game or will catch up on it if you didn’t. I’m sure you’re capable of making up your own mind. And in truth, it might be more a case of addressing the point to individuals — as well as the collective. Advertisement Getty Images Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk spoke to BBC Sport after the match, and he was pretty philosophical about what had just played out at Anfield: 💬 “It could have been a lot worse if we are absolutely honest. They had a big chance in the end. “I’m definitely disappointed with dropping points at home but it is what is. We have to move on and we will. “At 2-1 up, we lost the ball too easily at times and then were more open than we should have been. We’re not perfect, we're still learning and we have to learn from this as well.” Getty Images Frustration for Arne Slot's side that they are held at Anfield. They looked to have finally wrestled control after goals from Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah, following Lisandro Martinez's opener. But Amad salvaged a point for the visitors and that was probably about right. Liverpool were far from their best. Getty Images It was a huge chance for Harry Maguire to win it at the end. John O’Shea-type legend beckoned. But couldn’t get over the bouncing ball. Joshua Zirkzee was right to pick him out after a smart run. Manuel Ugarte’s pass to start that was magnificent. A thrilling game, a major boost for Ruben Amorim. So many good displays and a collective United unit. Really good day for Manchester United. They played with passion, aggression and overcame a setback within a game, and visibly found some belief as it went on. That’s enough for many fans to get behind. Getty Images Alexis Mac Allister has been speaking to Sky Sports after the final whistle, and there was clear disappointment from him on what Liverpool got from today. Here he is: 💬 “The result is not good enough. The performance wasn’t as good as we wanted, but it was fair. We conceded too many chances. We had our opportunities, but that’s football. “The effort was there, the mentality was there because we came back, but when you are winning after 70 minutes, you have to defend better and we didn’t do it. “Games where we are losing and after that, we react… That’s not what we want. These are the things we have to think about and improve.” Advertisement Manchester United remain winless in their last 10 away games against Liverpool in all competitions (five draws, five losses), their longest ever winless run at Anfield. However, United scored as many goals today as in their previous 10 away games at Anfield combined. Swings and roundabouts! Getty Images Some record. Only six players in history have more Premier League goals than these two. They're joint-seventh in the all-time list. The Athletic Manchester United had 54 per cent of their attacking touches in the left third of the pitch. That is a pretty stark statistic, illustrated beautifully above by our graphic from Mark Carey, demonstrating how much the visitors targeted Liverpool right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold and right-sided centre-back Ibrahima Konate.",

                "title": "Falcon - Wikipedia",
                "content": "38; see text. Falcons (/ˈfɒlkən, ˈfɔːl-, ˈfæl-/) are birds of prey in the genus Falco, which includes about 40 species. Some small species of falcons with long, narrow wings are called hobbies,[7] and some that hover while hunting are called kestrels.[7][8] Falcons are widely distributed on all continents of the world except Antarctica, though closely related raptors did occur there in the Eocene.[9] Adult falcons have thin, tapered wings, which enable them to fly at high speed and change direction rapidly. Fledgling falcons, in their first year of flying, have longer flight feathers, which make their configuration more like that of a general-purpose bird such as a broadwing. This makes flying easier while still learning the aerial skills required to be effective hunters like the adults. The falcons are the largest genus in the Falconinae subfamily of Falconidae, which also includes two other subfamilies comprising caracaras and a few other species of \"falcons\". All these birds kill prey with their beaks, using a tomial \"tooth\" on the side of their beaks — unlike the hawks, eagles and other larger birds of prey from the unrelated family Accipitridae, who use talons on their feet. The largest falcon is the gyrfalcon at up to 65 cm (26 in) in length. The smallest falcon species is the pygmy falcon, which measures just 20 cm (7.9 in). As with hawks and owls, falcons exhibit sexual dimorphism, with the females typically larger than the males, thus allowing a wider range of prey species.[10] As is the case with many birds of prey, falcons have exceptional powers of vision; the visual acuity of one species has been measured at 2.6 times that of human eyes.[11] They are incredibly fast fliers, with the Peregrine falcons having been recorded diving at speeds of 320 km/h (200 mph), making them the fastest-moving creatures on Earth; the fastest recorded dive attained a vertical speed of 390 km/h (240 mph).[12] The genus Falco was introduced in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae.[13] The type species is the merlin (Falco columbarius).[14] The genus name Falco is Late Latin meaning a \"falcon\" from falx, falcis, meaning \"a sickle\", referring to the claws of the bird.[15][16] In Middle English and Old French, the title faucon refers generically to several captive raptor species.[17] The traditional term for a male falcon is tercel (British spelling) or tiercel (American spelling), from the Latin tertius (third) because of the belief that only one in three eggs hatched a male bird. Some sources give the etymology as deriving from the fact that a male falcon is about one-third smaller than a female[18][19][20] (Old French: tiercelet). A falcon chick, especially one reared for falconry, still in its downy stage, is known as an eyas[21][22] (sometimes spelled eyass). The word arose by mistaken division of Old French un niais, from Latin presumed nidiscus (nestling) from nidus (nest). The technique of hunting with trained captive birds of prey is known as falconry. Compared to other birds of prey, the fossil record of the falcons is not well distributed in time. For years, the oldest fossils tentatively assigned to this genus were from the Late Miocene, less than 10 million years ago.[23] This coincides with a period in which many modern genera of birds became recognizable in the fossil record. As of 2021, the oldest falconid fossil is estimated to be 55 million years old.[24][25] Given the distribution of fossil and living Falco taxa, falcons are probably of North American, African, or possibly Middle Eastern or European origin. Falcons are not closely related to other birds of prey, and their nearest relatives are parrots and songbirds.[26] Falcons are roughly divisible into three or four groups. The first contains the kestrels (probably excepting the American kestrel);[17] usually small and stocky falcons of mainly brown upperside colour and sometimes sexually dimorphic; three African species that are generally gray in colour stand apart from the typical members of this group. The fox and greater kestrels can be told apart at first glance by their tail colours, but not by much else; they might be very close relatives and are probably much closer to each other than the lesser and common kestrels. Kestrels feed chiefly on terrestrial vertebrates and invertebrates of appropriate size, such as rodents, reptiles, or insects. The second group contains slightly larger (on average) species, the hobbies and relatives. These birds are characterized by considerable amounts of dark slate-gray in their plumage; their malar areas are nearly always black. They feed mainly on smaller birds. Third are the peregrine falcon and its relatives, variably sized powerful birds that also have a black malar area (except some very light color morphs), and often a black cap, as well. They are very fast birds with a maximum speed of 390 kilometres per hour. Otherwise, they are somewhat intermediate between the other groups, being chiefly medium grey with some lighter or brownish colours on their upper sides. They are, on average, more delicately patterned than the hobbies and, if the hierofalcons are excluded (see below), this group typically contains species with horizontal barring on their undersides. As opposed to the other groups, where tail colour varies much in general but little according to evolutionary relatedness,[note 1] the tails of the large falcons are quite uniformly dark grey with inconspicuous black banding and small, white tips, though this is probably plesiomorphic. These large Falco species feed on mid-sized birds and terrestrial vertebrates. Very similar to these, and sometimes included therein, are the four or so species of hierofalcon (literally, \"hawk-falcons\"). They represent taxa with, usually, more phaeomelanins, which impart reddish or brown colors, and generally more strongly patterned plumage reminiscent of hawks. Their undersides have a lengthwise pattern of blotches, lines, or arrowhead marks. While these three or four groups, loosely circumscribed, are an informal arrangement, they probably contain several distinct clades in their entirety. A study of mtDNA cytochrome b sequence data of some kestrels[17] identified a clade containing the common kestrel and related \"malar-striped\" species, to the exclusion of such taxa as the greater kestrel (which lacks a malar stripe), the lesser kestrel (which is very similar to the common, but also has no malar stripe), and the American kestrel, which has a malar stripe, but its colour pattern – apart from the brownish back – and also the black feathers behind the ear, which never occur in the true kestrels, are more reminiscent of some hobbies. The malar-striped kestrels apparently split from their relatives in the Gelasian, roughly 2.0–2.5 million years ago (Mya), and are seemingly of tropical East African origin. The entire \"true kestrel\" group—excluding the American species—is probably a distinct and quite young clade, as also suggested by their numerous apomorphies. Other studies[27][28][29][30][31] have confirmed that the hierofalcon are a monophyletic group–and that hybridization is quite frequent at least in the larger falcon species. Initial studies of mtDNA cytochrome b sequence data suggested that the hierofalcon are basal among living falcons.[27][28] The discovery of a NUMT proved this earlier theory erroneous.[29] In reality, the hierofalcon are a rather young group, originating at the same time as the start of the main kestrel radiation, about 2 Mya. Very little fossil history exists for this lineage. However, the present diversity of very recent origin suggests that this lineage may have nearly gone extinct in the recent past.[31][32] The phylogeny and delimitations of the peregrine and hobby groups are more problematic. Molecular studies have only been conducted on a few species, and the morphologically ambiguous taxa have often been little researched. The morphology of the syrinx, which contributes well to resolving the overall phylogeny of the Falconidae,[33][34] is not very informative in the present genus. Nonetheless, a core group containing the peregrine and Barbary falcons, which, in turn, group with the hierofalcon and the more distant prairie falcon (which was sometimes placed with the hierofalcon, though it is entirely distinct biogeographically), as well as at least most of the \"typical\" hobbies, are confirmed to be monophyletic as suspected.[27][28] Given that the American Falco species of today belong to the peregrine group, or are apparently more basal species, the initially most successful evolutionary radiation seemingly was a Holarctic one that originated possibly around central Eurasia or in (northern) Africa. One or several lineages were present in North America by the Early Pliocene at latest. The origin of today's major Falco groups—the \"typical\" hobbies and kestrels, for example, or the peregrine-hierofalcon complex, or the aplomado falcon lineage—can be quite confidently placed from the Miocene-Pliocene boundary through the Zanclean and Piacenzian and just into the Gelasian, that is from 2.4 to 5.3 Mya, when the malar-striped kestrels diversified. Some groups of falcons, such as the hierofalcon complex and the peregrine-Barbary superspecies, have only evolved in more recent times; the species of the former seem to be 120,000 years old or so.[31] The sequence follows the taxonomic order of White et al. (1996),[35] except for adjustments in the kestrel sequence. Several more paleosubspecies of extant species also been described; see species accounts for these. \"Sushkinia\" pliocaena from the Early Pliocene of Pavlodar (Kazakhstan) appears to be a falcon of some sort. It might belong in this genus or a closely related one.[36] In any case, the genus name Sushkinia is invalid for this animal because it had already been allocated to a prehistoric dragonfly relative. In 2015 the bird genus was renamed Psushkinia.[44] The supposed \"Falco\" pisanus was actually a pigeon of the genus Columba, possibly the same as Columba omnisanctorum, which, in that case, would adopt the older species name of the \"falcon\".[37] The Eocene fossil \"Falco\" falconellus (or \"F.\" falconella) from Wyoming is a bird of uncertain affiliations, maybe a falconid, maybe not; it certainly does not belong in this genus. \"Falco\" readei is now considered a paleosubspecies of the yellow-headed caracara (Milvago chimachima).",

                "content": "The Seattle Seahawks are a professional American football team based in Seattle. The Seahawks compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the National Football Conference (NFC) West division. The club entered the NFL as an expansion team in 1976 in the NFC. From 1977 to 2001, Seattle was assigned to the American Football Conference (AFC) West; the team rejoined the NFC in 2002. They have played their home games at Lumen Field in Seattle's SoDo neighborhood since 2002, having previously played home games in the Kingdome (1976–1999) and Husky Stadium (1994 and 2000–2001).[a] Seahawks fans have been referred to collectively as the \"12s\" (formerly the \"12th Man\"),[11][12][13] or the \"12th Fan\".[14][15][16][17][18] The team's fans twice set the Guinness World Record for the loudest crowd noise at a sporting event within the span of a few months, first registering 136.6 decibels during a game against the San Francisco 49ers in September 2013,[19] and later registering 137.6 dB during a Monday Night Football game against the New Orleans Saints that December.[20][21] As the only NFL team based in the Pacific Northwest region of North America, the Seahawks attract support from a wide geographical area that includes parts of the U.S. states of Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Utah, as well as the Canadian province of British Columbia.[22] The Seahawks have won 11 division titles and three conference championships, and are the only team to have played in both the AFC and NFC Championship Games. They have reached three Super Bowls, losing 21–10 to the Pittsburgh Steelers at Super Bowl XL, defeating the Denver Broncos 43–8 for their first championship at Super Bowl XLVIII, and losing 28–24 to the New England Patriots at Super Bowl XLIX. Players Kenny Easley, Walter Jones, Steve Hutchinson, Cortez Kennedy, and Steve Largent have been voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame primarily or wholly for their accomplishments as Seahawks. In addition, players Dave Brown, Jacob Green, Dave Krieg, Curt Warner, Jim Zorn, Matt Hasselbeck and Shaun Alexander have been inducted into the Seahawks Ring of Honor, along with head coaches Chuck Knox, and Mike Holmgren, radio announcer Pete Gross, and franchise owner Paul Allen. As per one of the agreed parts of the 1970 AFL–NFL merger, the NFL began planning to expand from 26 to 28 teams.[23] In June 1972, Seattle Professional Football Inc., a group of Seattle business and community leaders, announced their intention to acquire an NFL franchise for the city of Seattle.[24] In June 1974, the NFL gave the city an expansion franchise.[25] That December, NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle announced the official signing of the franchise agreement by Lloyd W. Nordstrom, representing the Nordstrom family as majority partners for the consortium.[26] In March 1975, John Thompson, former executive director of the NFL Management Council and a former Washington Huskies executive, was hired as the general manager of the new team. The name Seattle Seahawks (\"seahawk\" is another name for osprey) was selected on June 17, 1975, after a public naming contest which drew more than 20,000 entries and over 1,700 names.[27] These include skippers, pioneers, and lumberjacks.[28] Thompson recruited and hired Jack Patera, a Minnesota Vikings assistant coach, to be the first head coach of the Seahawks; the hiring was announced on January 3, 1976. The expansion draft was held March 30–31, 1976, with Seattle and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers alternating picks for rounds selecting unprotected players from the other 26 teams in the league.[29] The Seahawks were awarded the 2nd overall pick in the 1976 draft, a pick they used on defensive tackle Steve Niehaus. The team took the field for the first time on August 1, 1976, in a pre-season game against the San Francisco 49ers in the then newly opened Kingdome. The Seahawks are the only NFL team to switch conferences twice in the post-merger era.[33] The franchise began play in 1976 in the aforementioned NFC West but switched conferences with the Buccaneers after one season and joined the AFC West. This realignment was dictated by the league as part of the 1976 expansion plan, so that both expansion teams could play each other twice and every other NFL franchise once (the ones in their conference at the time) during their first two seasons. The Seahawks won both matchups against the Buccaneers in their first two seasons, the former of which was the Seahawks' first regular season victory.[34][35] In 1983, the Seahawks hired Chuck Knox as head coach. Finishing with a 9–7 record, the Seahawks made their first post-season appearance, defeating the Denver Broncos in the Wild Card Round, and then the Miami Dolphins, before losing in the AFC Championship to the eventual Super Bowl champion Los Angeles Raiders. The following season, the Seahawks had their best season to that point, finishing 12–4; it would remain the best win–loss record in franchise history until their 2005 season.[36] Knox won the NFL Coach of the Year Award.[37] In 1988, Ken Behring and partner Ken Hofmann purchased the team for a reported $80 million.[38][39][40] The Seahawks won their first division title in 1988, but would miss the playoffs for the following three seasons, after which Knox left the team.[41] For most of the 1990s, the Seahawks continued to struggle. They saw three consecutive losing seasons (1992–1994) under head coach Tom Flores, including a franchise worst 2–14 season in 1992. Following the 1994 season, Flores was fired from the team and Dennis Erickson was brought in as head coach.[42][43][44][45][46] In 1996, Behring and Hoffman transferred the team's operations to Anaheim, California–a widely criticized move, although the team continued to play in Seattle. The team almost relocated, and was in bankruptcy for a short period. The NFL threatened Behring with fining him $500,000 a day if he did not move the team's operations back to Seattle;[47] with this, Behring and Hoffman sold the team to Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen in 1997 for $200 million.[48] Erickson's tenure as head coach ended after the 1998 season; the Seahawks missed the playoffs for all four of his seasons with the team, extending their \"playoff drought\" to ten consecutive seasons.[49] In 1999, Mike Holmgren was hired as head coach.[50] He would coach for 10 seasons.[51] The Seahawks won their second division title, as well as a wild card berth in the playoffs, losing to the Miami Dolphins 20–17. In 2002, the Seahawks returned to the NFC West as part of an NFL realignment plan that gave each conference four balanced divisions of four teams each. This realignment restored the AFC West to its initial post-merger roster of original AFL teams Denver, San Diego, Kansas City, and Oakland.[52] That same year, the team opened its new home stadium, Seahawks Stadium, after spending the last two seasons at Husky Stadium after the Kingdome's implosion in 2000.[53] In the 2005 season, the Seahawks had their best season in franchise history (a feat that would later be matched in 2013) with a record of 13–3,[54] which included a 42–0 rout of the Philadelphia Eagles in a Monday Night Football game.[55] The 13–3 record earned them the number one seed in the NFC.[54] They defeated the Washington Redskins in the Divisional Round and won the NFC Championship Game against the Carolina Panthers, but lost in Super Bowl XL against the Pittsburgh Steelers. The loss was controversial; NFL Films has Super Bowl XL at number 8 on its top ten list of games with controversial referee calls.[56] Referee Bill Leavy later admitted that he missed calls that altered the game.[57] Before 2005, the Seahawks had not won a playoff game since the 1984 season, a streak of 21 years (five teams had ever had a drought of twenty years at the time, with their six straight losses being tied for third-most in history). That drought was ended with a 20–10 win over the Washington Redskins in the 2005 playoffs.[58] In the 2006 season, the Seahawks finished 9–7 and won the NFC West.[59] The defeated the Dallas Cowboys 21–20 in the Wild Card Round before losing to the Chicago Bears 27–24 in the Divisional Round.[60][61] In the 2007 season, the Seahawks finished 10–6 and won the NFC West.[62] The team defeated Washington in the Wild Card Round 35–14 before losing to the Green Bay Packers in the Divisional Round 42–20.[63][64] The 2008 season saw the team go 4–12 and finish third in the NFC West.[65] Holmgren departed from the team after the 2008 season, following the end of his contract.[66] Defensive backs coach Jim L. Mora was named as Holmgren's successor.[67] In 2009, the Seahawks finished 3rd in the NFC West with a 5–11 record.[68] Shortly after, Mora was fired on January 8, 2010 [69] and Pete Carroll was hired. In the 2010 NFL season, the Seahawks made history by making it into the playoffs despite having a 7–9 record.[70] They had the best record in a division full of teams with losing seasons (Seahawks 7–9, Rams 7–9, 49ers 6–10, Cardinals 5–11) and won the decisive season finale against the Rams (not only by overall record, but by division record, as both teams coming into the game had a 3–2 division record).[71] In the playoffs, the Seahawks beat the defending Super Bowl XLIV champs, the New Orleans Saints, 41–36. The Seahawks made even more history during the game with Marshawn Lynch's 67-yard run, breaking 9 tackles, to clinch the victory. After the run, the fans reacted so loudly that a small earthquake (a bit above 2 on the Richter Scale) was recorded by seismic equipment around Seattle.[72] Lynch's run would be nicknamed the \"Beast Quake\". The Seahawks lost to the Bears in their second game, 35–24.[73] The 2011 season saw the team go 7–9 once again, but they were not able to get into the postseason with a third-place finish in the NFC West.[74] The 2012 NFL season started with doubt, as the Seahawks lost their season opener against the Arizona Cardinals. The highly touted Seattle defense gave up a go-ahead score late in the fourth quarter, and rookie quarterback Russell Wilson failed to throw the game-winning touchdown after multiple attempts in the red-zone. However, Russell Wilson and the Seahawks went 4–1 in their next five games en route to an 11–5 overall record (their first winning record since 2007). Their 2012 campaign included big wins over the Green Bay Packers, New England Patriots, and San Francisco 49ers. The Seahawks went into the playoffs as the No. 5 seed and the only team that season to go undefeated at home. In the Wild Card Round, the Seahawks overcame a 14-point deficit to defeat the Washington Redskins.[75] This was the first time since the 1983 Divisional Round that the Seahawks won a playoff game on the road.[76] However, in the 2012 Divisional Round, overcoming a 20-point, fourth-quarter deficit would not be enough to defeat the #1 seed Atlanta Falcons. An ill-advised timeout and a defensive breakdown late in the game cost the Seahawks their season, as they lost, 30–28.[77] Quarterback Russell Wilson won the 2012 Pepsi MAX Rookie of the Year award.[78] In the 2013 NFL season, the Seahawks continued their momentum from the previous season, finishing tied with the Denver Broncos for an NFL-best regular season record of 13–3, while earning the NFC's #1 playoff seed.[79][80] Their 2013 campaign included big wins over the Carolina Panthers, New Orleans Saints, and the San Francisco 49ers.[81] Six Seahawks players were named to the Pro Bowl: Quarterback Russell Wilson, center Max Unger, running back Marshawn Lynch, cornerback Richard Sherman, free safety Earl Thomas, and strong safety Kam Chancellor.[82] However, none of them were able to play in the Pro Bowl, as the Seahawks defeated the New Orleans Saints 23–15 and the San Francisco 49ers 23–17, in the playoffs to advance to Super Bowl XLVIII against the Denver Broncos.[83][84] On February 2, 2014, the Seahawks won the franchise's only Super Bowl Championship, defeating Denver 43–8.[85] The Seahawks' defense performance in 2013 was acclaimed as one of the best in the Super Bowl era.[86] The 2014 campaign saw the team lose some key pieces, including wide receiver Golden Tate to free agency and wide receiver Sidney Rice and defensive end Chris Clemons to retirement. Percy Harvin was also let go mid-season after several underachieving weeks and clashes with the rest of the locker room.[87] Despite starting 3–3, they rallied to a 12–4 record, good enough once again for the #1 seed in the NFC Playoffs.[88][89] After dispatching the Carolina Panthers handily in the Divisional Round 31–17,[90] they faced the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship Game. Despite five turnovers and trailing 19–7 late in the contest, the Seahawks prevailed in overtime to reach Super Bowl XLIX against the New England Patriots,[91] but an ill-fated interception at the 1-yard line late in the championship game stymied a comeback attempt and thwarted the Seahawks' bid to be the first repeat Super Bowl champions since the Patriots had won Super Bowls XXXVIII and XXXIX.[92] The Seahawks returned to the playoffs in both 2015 and 2016, but despite winning the Wild Card game in both years they failed to win either Divisional round game on the road.[93][94][95][96] The 2017 iteration of the team missed the playoffs for the first time in six years, as injuries to their core players coupled with disappointing acquisitions of running back Eddie Lacy and kicker Blair Walsh failed them in a competitive NFC.[97] The team cut ties with most of the remaining players that had been part of their meteoric rise and turnover both their Offensive and Defensive coaching staff in 2018, and an influx of young talent helped propel the team to a 10–6 record and another playoff berth that ultimately ended in a loss in the Wild Card game to the Dallas Cowboys.[98][99] In October 2018, owner Paul Allen died after a prolonged fight with cancer.[100] In 2019, the Seahawks put up their best record since their last trip to the Super Bowl at 11–5, but they still lost 3 out of their last 4 games and lost their chance to win the NFC West.[101] A likely explanation for their sloppy finish is because many of their players were injured late in the season. After defeating the Philadelphia Eagles 17–9 in the Wild Card game,[102] they lost to the Green Bay Packers in the Divisional round, failing another attempt at a second Super Bowl.[103] The 2020 season saw the Seahawks win their first five games, a franchise-best for a start to a season.[104] Despite the Seahawks losing three of their next four games, the Seahawks finished strong, earning twelve victories for the first time since their Super Bowl season in 2014, and winning the division for the first time in four years.[105] However, despite the 12–4 record and the division title, the Seahawks' season ended the following week against the Los Angeles Rams, who never trailed in a 30–20 victory.[106] The Seahawks struggled and started the 2021 season 3–8. Russell Wilson had an injured finger missing 3 games and the Seahawks were shut out the first time in the Wilson era in Week 10 against the Green Bay Packers.[107] This was their worst first half of a season since 2009, under then-head coach Jim Mora. The Seahawks were eliminated from playoff contention on December 26 in a loss to the Chicago Bears, and they finished last in their division for the first time since 1996.[108][109] With wins over the Detroit Lions and the Arizona Cardinals they finished 7–10.[110] Following the 2021 season was an offseason of continuing change, punctuated with the trade of quarterback Russell Wilson to the team he and the Seahawks beat in Super Bowl XLVIII, the Denver Broncos, on March 6, 2022. The Broncos traded quarterback Drew Lock, tight end Noah Fant, defensive end Shelby Harris, two first round picks (for that year's draft, No. 9 overall, and 2023's), two second round picks (that year's, No. 40 overall, and 2023's) and a 2022 fifth round selection to the Seahawks for Wilson and a 2022 fourth round pick. Another hallmark franchise player from the Super Bowl-winning Seahawks, former All-Pro linebacker Bobby Wagner, was also cut by the team that same day, a move that saves them $16.6 million in cap space. The Seahawks also took on $26 million in dead money by trading Wilson; ESPN Stats & Information research revealed it to be the second-most dead money a team has ever incurred, trailing the $33.8 million the Philadelphia Eagles ate in their trade of Carson Wentz the previous year.[111] In the 2022 season, the Seahawks finished with a 9–8 record and made the playoffs.[112] The team's season ended in the Wild Card round with a 41–23 loss to the San Francisco 49ers.[113] The 2023 season saw the Seahawks finish 9–8 and miss the postseason.[114] Carroll was fired from his head coaching position after the 2023 season.[115] Carroll remained with the team in an unspecified advisory role.[116] Mike Macdonald, formerly defensive coordinator of the Baltimore Ravens, was hired as the new head coach.[117] When the Seahawks debuted in 1976, the team's logo was a stylized royal blue and forest green osprey's head based on Kwakwakaʼwakw art masks.[118] The helmet and pants were silver while the home jerseys were royal blue with white and green sleeve stripes and white numerals and names. The road jersey was white, with white, blue and green sleeve stripes and had blue numerals and names. The socks were blue and had the same green and white striping pattern seen on the blue jerseys. Black shoes were worn for the first four seasons, one of the few NFL teams that did so in the late 1970s, at a time when most teams were wearing white shoes. They would switch to white shoes in 1980.[119][120] In 1983, coinciding with the arrival of Chuck Knox as head coach, the uniforms were updated slightly. The striping on the arms now incorporated the Seahawks logo, and the TV numbers, previously located on the sleeves, moved onto the shoulders. The helmet facemasks changed from gray to blue. Also, the socks went solid blue at the top, and white on bottom.[121] In the 1985 season, the team wore 10th Anniversary patches on the left side of their pants. It had the Seahawks logo streaking through the number 10. In 1994, the year of the NFL's 75th Anniversary, the Seahawks changed the style of their numbering to something more suitable for the team; Pro Block from then until 2001. That same year, the Seahawks wore a vintage jersey for select games resembling the 1976–82 uniforms. However, the helmet facemasks remained blue. The logos also became sewn on instead of being screen-printed. In 2000, Shaun Alexander's rookie year and Cortez Kennedy's last, the Seattle Seahawks celebrated their 25th Anniversary; the logo was worn on the upper left chest of the jersey. In 2001, the Seahawks switched to the new Reebok uniform system still in their then-current uniforms after that company signed a 10-year deal to be the exclusive uniform supplier to the NFL, but it would be their last in this uniform after the season ended. Prior to this, various companies made the team's uniforms. On March 1, 2002, to coincide with the team moving to the NFC as well as the opening of Seahawks Stadium (later renamed Qwest, CenturyLink, and currently Lumen Field), both the logo and the uniforms were heavily redesigned. The Wordmark was designed by Mark Verlander and the logo was designed by NFL Properties in-house design team. The colors were modified to a lighter \"Seahawks Blue\", a darker \"Seahawks Navy\" and lime green piping. The helmets also were changed from silver to the lighter \"Seahawks Blue\" color after a fan poll was conducted. Silver would not be seen again until 2012. The logo artwork was also subtly altered, with an arched eyebrow and a forward-facing pupil suggesting a more aggressive-looking bird. At first, the team had planned to wear silver helmets at home and blue helmets on the road, but since NFL rules forbid the use of multiple helmets, the team held the fan poll to decide which color helmet would be worn. The team had usually worn all blue at home and all white on the road since 2003, but late in the 2009 season, the Seahawks wore the white jersey-blue pants combo. The blue jersey and white pants combo has been worn for only one regular-season game, the 2005 season opener at the Jacksonville Jaguars, while the white jersey and blue pants combination has not been worn regularly since late in the 2002 season, with the exception of late in the 2009 season. In 2009, the Seahawks once again wore the white jersey and blue pants combination for road games against Minnesota (November 22), St. Louis (November 29), Houston (December 13), and Green Bay (December 27). The Seahawks wore their home blue jerseys during Super Bowl XL despite being designated as the visitor, since the Pittsburgh Steelers, the designated home team, elected to wear their white jerseys. On September 27, 2009, the Seahawks wore lime green jerseys for the first time, paired with new dark navy blue pants in a game against the Chicago Bears. The jerseys matched their new sister team, the expansion Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer who wear green jerseys with blue pants. On December 6, 2009, the Seahawks wore their Seahawks blue jersey with the new dark navy blue pants for the first time, in a game against the San Francisco 49ers. The Seahawks broke out the same combo two weeks later against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and two weeks after that in the 2009 regular-season finale against the Tennessee Titans. In December 2009, then-coach Jim Mora announced that the new lime green jerseys were being retired because the team did not win in them, because he liked the standard blue home jerseys better, and added that the home jersey is a better match for the navy pants.[122] In the same press conference, he stated that the new navy pants \"felt better\" on players as opposed to the Seahawks blue pants. For the 2010 season, Seattle returned to the traditional all \"Seahawks Blue\" at home and all white on the road. On April 3, 2012, Nike, which took over as the official uniform supplier for the league from Reebok, unveiled new uniform and logo designs for the Seahawks for the 2012 season. The new designs incorporate a new accent color, \"Wolf Grey\", and the main colors are \"College Navy\" and \"Action Green\".[5][6] The uniforms incorporate \"feather trims\", multiple feathers on the crown of the helmet, twelve feathers printed on the neckline and down each pant leg to represent the \"12th Man\", referring to the team's fans.[123][124] The Seahawks have three different jersey colors: navy blue, white, and an alternate grey jersey. The Seahawks will have three different pants: navy blue with green feathers, gray with navy blue feathers, and white with navy blue feathers. Their new logo replaces the Seahawk blue with wolf grey. Altogether, there are nine different uniform combinations possible. The Seahawks wore their Nike home blue jerseys for the first regular-season game on September 16, 2012, against the Dallas Cowboys. The uniform Marshawn Lynch wore in that game is preserved at the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[125] On September 9, 2012, the Seahawks wore their Nike white away jerseys for the first regular-season game against the Arizona Cardinals; on October 14, 2012, with the Carolina Panthers wearing white at home, they wore their blue jerseys with gray pants (and would do so again against the Miami Dolphins seven weeks later); and on December 16, 2012, they wore their Alternate Wolf Grey jerseys for the first time against the Buffalo Bills.[126] The all-navy ensemble is the Seahawks' current primary uniform option for home games. Initially, the Seahawks paired their navy uniforms with gray pants on select road games in which the home team wore white jerseys, but on December 5, 2021, the Seahawks wore this combination at home for the first time in a game against the San Francisco 49ers. On the road, the Seahawks primarily pair their white uniforms with the navy pants (that combination was used during their Super Bowl XLVIII win), although they also pair the white uniforms with either white or gray pants on occasion. The all-gray uniforms were worn occasionally on the road, mainly against the Arizona Cardinals. In 2016, the Seahawks unveiled their NFL Color Rush uniform, an all-Action Green ensemble.[127] They first wore the uniform on December 16 against the Los Angeles Rams at home, marking the first time they wore green uniforms since 2009. The Seahawks continue to wear the Color Rush set as an alternate uniform alongside the all-gray combination. During a home matchup with the Vikings on December 3, 2019, the Seahawks wore their Color Rush green tops and regular navy pants.[128] The combination was used again on October 11, 2020, also against the Vikings, and then again on November 19, against the Arizona Cardinals. It was used once in 2021, on Thursday Night Football vs. the Rams. In July 2023, the Seahawks introduced a throwback uniform set inspired by the team's 1983–2001 design. These uniforms were worn in Week 8 against the Cleveland Browns.[129] Consequently, the gray alternate tops were retired due to NFL regulations restricting teams to two alternate jerseys.[130] Prior to 2023, the Seahawks were the only NFL team to have never worn white jerseys in a home game.[131] However, on September 24, 2023, the Seahawks wore their white jerseys at home for the first time, doing so against the Carolina Panthers. The game served as the 10th anniversary of the Seahawks' first Super Bowl victory, as the current team wore the same white jersey/navy pants combination from Super Bowl XLVIII.[132] The rivalry between the Seahawks and Los Angeles Rams came into existence in 2002 following the Seahawks' relocation to the NFC West. The first notable matchup between the two clubs occurred in the 2004 NFC Wild card round when the Rams managed to defeat the Seahawks in Seattle 27–20 and currently hold the streak for the only two wins against the Seahawks at home during the postseason. Much of the intensity waned as the Rams declined in competition throughout the 2000s and early 2010s, but several notable matchups between the two clubs would still occur. The rivalry saw new life as the Rams' Mob Squad-era teams regularly clashed with Seattle's Legion of Boom era teams, often escalating into bitter grudge matches for control of the division.[133][134] Following the Rams' return to Los Angeles in 2016, and subsequent playoff success (most recently with a Super Bowl victory in 2022); the rivalry has increased in intensity; especially as Seattle's Legion of Boom era teams waned in competition.[135] Due to the recent dominance by the Rams under Sean McVay and former defensive tackle Aaron Donald, Seahawks fans have recently viewed the Rams as their divisional arch rival.[136] Tensions especially ran high during the 2021 Wild Card game following a widely publicized taunt from Safety Jamal Adams during a postgame conference after a tough win over the Rams during week 16. The Rams would go onto decimate the Seahawks in the wild card game, with cornerback Jalen Ramsey and quarterback Jared Goff expressing their satisfaction to get retribution following Adams' comments and cigar gesture.[137] As of the 2023 season, the Seahawks lead the series 27–26, but the Rams have won both playoff meetings.[138] From 2011 to 2014, the Seahawks and the San Francisco 49ers emerged as two of the best teams in the NFC, and developed a rivalry as a result. The 49ers head coach at the time, Jim Harbaugh, had a contentious history with Seahawks coach Pete Carroll due to Harbaugh's previous job as coach at Stanford against Carroll's USC Trojans. Harbaugh's 49ers won the first three head-to-head contests but lost Week 16 of 2012. Both teams reached the playoffs that year, however the 49ers reached Super Bowl XLVII, which they lost. In 2013, the Seahawks won in a Week 2 contest, but the 49ers would triumph in Week 14. The Seahawks would beat the 49ers in the 2013 season NFC Championship Game 23–17 in a controversial win. The Seahawks went on to win the next 10 matchups, sweeping the regular season series against the 49ers from 2014 to 2018. Since then, however, the 49ers have won the last five contests against the Seahawks, winning the 2022 season regular season series, and a playoff matchup, as well as the 2023 regular season series. As of the 2023 season, the Seahawks lead the series 30–22.[139] The Arizona Cardinals and Seahawks became divisional rivals after both were relocated to the NFC West as a result of the league's realignment in 2002. This rivalry has become one of the NFL's more bitter in recent years, as the mid-to-late 2010s often saw the Seahawks and Cardinals squaring off for NFC West supremacy. The rivalry hit its peak as the Cardinals frequently clashed with the Legion Of Boom-era Seahawks led by Russell Wilson and head coach Pete Carroll, although Seattle shares more intense rivalries with the Rams and 49ers. Seattle leads the series 27–22–1, and the two teams have yet to meet in the playoffs.[140] Since moving to the NFC, the Seahawks have faced the Green Bay Packers several times in the playoffs, developing an intense rivalry as well. Some notable moments include the clubs' first playoff meeting in 2003 in which Seahawks quarterback Matt Hasselbeck threw a game-losing pick-six in overtime after guaranteeing a game-winning drive,[141] the Fail Mary, and Russell Wilson overcoming four interceptions and a 16–0 Packers lead to lead Seattle to a 28–22 overtime win to advance to Super Bowl XLIX.[142] As of the 2023 season, the Packers lead the all-time series 15–9.[143] From the 1980s to the 2002 league realignment, the Denver Broncos were a major rival for the Seahawks.[144][145] As of the 2023 season, the Broncos lead 35–23 against the Seahawks with Seattle having won both postseason meetings.[146] Since 2002, Denver has won three of five interconference meetings, and the teams met in Super Bowl XLVIII on February 2, 2014, where the Seahawks won 43–8.[147] On March 8, 2022, the Seattle Seahawks agreed to trade Russell Wilson and a 2022 fourth-round pick to the Denver Broncos for quarterback Drew Lock, tight end Noah Fant, defensive lineman Shelby Harris, two first-round picks (2022—No. 9 overall—and 2023), two second-round picks (2022—No. 40 overall—and 2023) and a 2022 fifth-round selection.[148] Russell Wilson's first game against the Seattle Seahawks as a member of the Denver Broncos was played September 12, 2022, on Monday Night Football, where the Seahawks won 17–16.[149] The Raiders and Seahawks played many times being old members of the AFC West. Seattle's move to the NFC has made the matchup occur much less frequently, playing only five times since the end of the 2002 season. The Raiders lead the all-time series 30–26.[150] During the Seahawks' first ten seasons (1976–85), the team's headquarters was in Kirkland at the southern end of the Lake Washington Shipyard (now Carillon Point), on the shores of Lake Washington.[151] The summer training camps were held across the state at Eastern Washington University in Cheney, southwest of Spokane. When the team's new headquarters across town in Kirkland was completed in 1986, the Seahawks held training camp at home for the next eleven seasons (1986–96), staying in the dormitories of the adjacent Northwest College. In 1997, Dennis Erickson's third season as head coach, the team returned to the hotter and more isolated Cheney for training camp, which continued through 2006. In 2007, training camp returned to the Seahawk's Kirkland facility because of the scheduled China Bowl (NFL) game, which was later canceled. In 2008, the Seahawks held the first three weeks of camp in Kirkland, then moved to the new 19-acre (77,000 m2) Virginia Mason Athletic Center (VMAC) on August 18 for the final week of training camp, where the team has held their training camps since. The new facility, adjacent to Lake Washington in Renton, has four full-size practice fields: three natural grass outdoors and one FieldTurf indoors.[152] As of the end of the 2023 season, the Seattle Seahawks have competed in 48 NFL seasons, dating back to their expansion year of 1976. The team has compiled a 392–366–1 (.517) regular-season record and a 17–19 (.472) record in the playoffs, for an overall record of 409–385–1 and a .515 winning percentage.[153] Seattle has reached the playoffs in 20 separate seasons, including in the 2005 season when they lost Super Bowl XL to the Pittsburgh Steelers, the 2013 season when they defeated the Denver Broncos to win Super Bowl XLVIII, and the 2014 season when they lost Super Bowl XLIX to the New England Patriots. In the 2010 season, the Seahawks became the first team in NFL history to earn a spot in the playoffs with a losing record (7–9, .438) in a full season; this was by winning the division. The Seahawks would go on to defeat the reigning Super Bowl champion New Orleans Saints in the Wild Card round, becoming the first team ever to win a playoff game with a losing record. Until Week 7 of the 2016 season against the Arizona Cardinals, the Seahawks had never recorded a tied game in their history.[154] Running backs (RB) Wide receivers (WR) Tight ends (TE) Defensive linemen (DL) Defensive backs (DB) Special teams Reserve 53 active, 11 reserve, 13 practice squad (+3 exempt) The 35th Anniversary team was voted upon by users on Seahawks.com and announced in 2010.[155] Bold indicates those elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

In 2002, the Seahawks began playing at what is now Lumen Field. Every regular season and playoff game at Lumen Field since the second week of the 2003 season has been played before a sellout crowd. Like the Kingdome before it, Lumen Field is one of the loudest stadiums in the league. The stadium's partial roof and seating decks trap and amplify the noise and reflect it back down to the field. This noise has caused problems for opposing teams, causing them to commit numerous false-start penalties. From 2002 through 2012, there have been 143 false-start penalties on visiting teams in Seattle, second only to the Minnesota Vikings.[168] The Seahawks' fans have twice set the Guinness World Record for the loudest crowd noise at a sporting event, first on September 15, 2013, registering 136.6 dB during a game against the San Francisco 49ers[19] and again on December 2, 2013, during a Monday Night Football game against the New Orleans Saints, with a roar of 137.6 dB.[20][21] As of September 29, 2014, the record of 142.2 dB is held in Arrowhead Stadium by fans of the Kansas City Chiefs.[169] Prior to kickoff of each home game, the Seahawks salute their fans by raising a giant #12 flag at the south end of the stadium.[170] Current and former players, coaches, local celebrities, prominent fans including Patti Hammond, Seattle-area athletes, and former owner Paul Allen have raised the flag. Earlier, the Seahawks retired the #12 jersey on December 15, 1984, as a tribute to their fans.[157] Before their Super Bowl win, the Seahawks ran onto the field under a giant 12th Man flag. In September 1990, Texas A&M University filed, and was later granted, a trademark application for the \"12th Man\" term, based on their continual usage of the term since the 1920s. In January 2006, Texas A&M filed suit against the Seattle Seahawks to protect the trademark and in May 2006, the dispute was settled out of court. In the agreement, which expired in 2016, Texas A&M licensed the Seahawks to continue using the phrase, in exchange for a licensing fee, public acknowledgement of A&M's trademark when using the term, a restriction in usage of the term to seven states in the Northwest United States, and a prohibition from selling any \"12th Man\" merchandise.[171][172][173] Once the agreement expired, the Seahawks were allowed to continue using the number \"12\" but were no longer permitted to use the \"12th Man\" phrase.[174] In August 2015, the Seahawks decided to drop their signage of the \"12th Man\" term and shifted towards referring to their fans as the \"12s\" instead.[175] Starting in the 1998 season, Blitz has been the Seahawks' official mascot.[176] Prior to the 2014 NFL season, Blitz was given a new look and a sidekick; a secondary mascot named Boom was introduced to appeal to and interact with younger children.[177][178] In the 2003 and 2004 seasons, a hawk named Faith would fly around the stadium just before the team came out of the tunnel. However, because of her relatively small size and an inability to be trained to lead the team out of the tunnel, Faith was replaced by an augur hawk named Taima before the start of the 2005 NFL season. Taima started leading the team out of the tunnel in September 2006.[179][180] A group of female and male cheerleaders known as the Seahawks Dancers rallies the crowd from the sidelines and performs a halftime routine during home games at Lumen Field. The group was an all-female squad called the Sea Gals prior to admitting male members and re-branding ahead of the 2019 NFL season.[181][182] During the off-season, a select performing group from the Dancers travels to parades and other events, as well as with other NFL Cheerleaders on the road. Beginning in 2004, the Seahawks introduced their drum line, the Blue Thunder.[183] The group plays at every home game as well as over 100 events in the Seattle community.

The current announcers are former Seahawks players Steve Raible (who was the team's color commentator from 1982 to 2003) and Dave Wyman.[187] The Raible-Wyman regular season pairing has been together since the final four games of 2017 but became full time starting in 2018. On local television broadcast preseason games are split between former Seahawks Paul Moyer, Sam Adkins, and Brock Huard. Pete Gross, who called the games from 1976 until just days before his death from cancer in 1992, is a member of the team's Ring of Honor. Other past announcers include Steve Thomas from 1992 to 1997, Lee Hamilton (also known as \"Hacksaw\") from 1998 to 1999, Brian Davis from 2000 to 2003, and former Seahawk Warren Moon from 2004 to 2017. Preseason games not shown on national networks were produced in-house by Seahawks Broadcasting and televised by KING-TV, channel 5 (and, in 2008, also on sister station KONG-TV since KING, an NBC affiliate, was committed to the Summer Olympics in China). Kate Scott became the announcer for Seahawks TV preseason games in 2023, replacing Curt Menefee (the host of Fox NFL Sunday) who had been the Seahawks TV voice since the 2009 preseason. KCPQ-TV, which airs most of the Seahawks' regular-season games (as the Seattle-Tacoma area's Fox affiliate), became the television partner for the team in 2012 and replaced KING-TV as broadcaster for preseason games, but KING-TV regained the partnership in 2022; simulcasts of any Seahawks games on ESPN's Monday Night Football air (as of the 2018 season) on CBS affiliate KIRO-TV.[188][189] In addition, any Saturday or Sunday afternoon games broadcast by CBS (usually—but not always—with the Seahawks hosting an AFC opponent) will air on KIRO-TV.

                "content": "James Lee Williams (12 April 1992 – January 2025), known professionally as The Vivienne, was a British drag performer, known for being appointed as the UK Drag Ambassador in 2015 for American reality television series RuPaul's Drag Race. He later competed in and won the first series of RuPaul's Drag Race UK in 2019, and competed again in the seventh season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars in 2022. He became the first drag performer to compete on Dancing on Ice in 2023, appearing as a contestant on the fifteenth series, in which he finished in third place. The Vivienne delved into other ventures such as releasing his debut extended play (EP), Bitch on Heels (2022). He starred as the Wicked Witch of the West for The Wizard of Oz in the 2024 UK tour. Williams was born and raised in North Wales and moved to Liverpool at 16 years old. He attended Rydal Penrhos in Colwyn Bay.[1] He was of Welsh and Romani heritage.[2] Williams was given the name The Vivienne, because she was known for wearing Vivienne Westwood clothing, adding the definite article to make it unique. Her first drag show was located in Liverpool and has worked in various bars such as Superstar Boudoir.[3] The Vivienne competed in a one-day event judged by RuPaul, Katie Price, and Jonathan Ross, taking place at Café de Paris. She placed in the top two alongside drag performer La Voix, and was crowned as the UK Ambassador for RuPaul's Drag Race on 28 May 2015.[4] The Vivienne was later flown to Los Angeles and made a cameo appearance for the eight series of RuPaul's Drag Race (2016).[5] The Vivienne was announced to compete the first series of RuPaul's Drag Race UK (2019).[6] Throughout the competition, she won three challenges including the Snatch Game, where she impersonated American politician Donald Trump alongside drag performer Baga Chipz, who impersonated stateswoman Margaret Thatcher.[7] The Vivienne ultimately won and was crowned as the \"First Drag Superstar\" for the United Kingdom.[8] In September 2019, The Vivienne participated in a racing competition webseries where drag performers compete for their selected charity. This was in collaboration with luxury vehicle brand Jaguar Cars and lifestyle magazine Attitude.[9] She raced for Sahir House, a charity based in her hometown of Liverpool that provides a space in which people can speak freely without fear of prejudice, stigma, abuse or exploitation in relation to HIV.[10] In November, The Vivienne embarked on a three-month tour alongside her competitors from RuPaul's Drag Race UK, hosted by drag performer Alyssa Edwards.[11] The next month, herself and Baga Chipz reprise their Snatch Game impersonations of Donald Trump and Margaret Thatcher respectively in Morning T&T, a fictional television news show.[12] In an interview with Gay Times, she described the series as a \"spoof of Good Morning Britain and Good Morning America.\"[13] American production company World of Wonder announced a six-part series in March 2020, that documents The Vivienne producing a music video meanwhile she travels throughout Los Angeles, United States.[14] The Vivienne Takes on Hollywood premiered on BBC Three and simultaneously streaming through WOW Presents Plus on 9 April 2020.[15] The same month, herself and Baga Chipz co-presented the British version of I Like to Watch, a webseries where they humorously review any original programming from Netflix.[16] After appearing on several television series, The Vivienne released her debut song titled \"Tonight\" on 20 May 2020.[17] She expressed the dance-pop song as \"the epitome of the word banger\" that combines both the \"thumping bass and soaring vocals\".[18] Months later, The Vivienne covered \"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\" (1984) by pop band Dead or Alive on 21 October. The drag performer mainly paid tribute to late musician Pete Burns; alongside a lyric video was released.[19] She was one of the four competitors who appeared in the special Christmas edition of The Great British Sewing Bee that was transmitted on New Year's Eve 2020 on BBC One.[20] In June 2021, The Vivienne made a guest appearance as herself in the ITV soap opera, Emmerdale.[21] In January 2022, The Vivienne starred in Channel 4's Celebrity Hunted, in aid of Stand Up to Cancer.[22] In April 2022, The Vivienne was announced as part of the seventh season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars, whereby former winners of the franchise returned for the title of \"Queen of All Queens\".[23] In October 2022, she was announced to be competing in the fifteenth series of ITV ice-skating reality show, Dancing on Ice, setting her to be the first drag artist to participate in the show.[24] On 12 March 2023, The Vivienne finished in third place.[25] In June 2023, The Vivienne presented the award for \"Scene of the Year\" at the 2023 British Soap Awards.[26] Williams married David Ludford in 2019.[27][28] In April 2023, the couple announced their separation.[29] In June 2023, Williams was the victim of a homophobic attack in a McDonald's restaurant in Liverpool.[30] In a statement, Merseyside Police confirmed that \"a man made homophobic comments towards him [The Vivienne] and then proceeded to punch him in the face before fleeing the scene\".[31] Williams utilised the attack as a way of highlighting the fact that homophobia still exists in 2023 and for members of the LGBT+ community to remain vigilant when out in public.[32] In December 2023, 51-year-old Alan Whitfield from Everton was found guilty of assault motivated by homophobia.[33] He was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison with an 18-month suspended sentence on 5 January 2024.[34] On 5 January 2025, it was announced that Williams had died at the age of 32.[35][36] In a statement from his agent, it was confirmed that Williams had \"died over the weekend\" and that his family would not be releasing any further details at present.[37] As of 5 January 2025,[update] the cause of death is unknown.[38] The RuPaul's Drag Race social media accounts paid tribute to Williams, memorialising him as a \"beacon of creativity and authenticity\" and that [The Vivienne] \"embodied what it [meant] to be a true champion\". Tributes were paid by several of The Vivienne's Drag Race co-stars, as well as Michelle Visage, who described Williams as a \"beacon to so many\" and added that he would be \"so missed\".[39][40] The Vivienne is the first winner of the Drag Race franchise to pass away.[41][42] (with the Cast of RuPaul's Drag Race UK) (RuPaul featuring the Cast of RuPaul's Drag Race UK)",

                "content": "Tributes flood in for ‘warm-hearted and amazing’ drag artist James Lee Williams James Lee Williams, known as drag artist The Vivienne, has died at the age of 32, their public relations representative announced on Sunday. Simon Jones posted on Instagram: “It is with immense sadness that we let you know our beloved James Lee Williams – The Vivienne, has passed this weekend. “James was an incredibly loved, warm-hearted and amazing person. Their family are heartbroken at the loss of their son, brother and uncle. They are so proud of the wonderful things James achieved in their life and career. “We will not be releasing any further details. We please ask that James’s family are given the time and privacy they now need to process and grieve.” Williams, whose drag name came from their love of the fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, rose to prominence after becoming the UK drag ambassador for the US series of RuPaul’s Drag Race in 2015. They won the first UK series of the show in 2019 after lip-syncing in the final to I’m Your Man, a song by Wham! Williams subsequently appeared in the seventh season of RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars and was a finalist in the UK series of Dancing on Ice in 2023, finishing in third place. The drag artist most recently played the Childcatcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang on tour and previously appeared as the Wicked Witch of the West in the revival of the Wizard of Oz musical. Their film credits included Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie and their TV credits included Emmerdale. Tributes were paid to Williams on social media on Sunday. RuPaul’s Drag Race judge Michelle Visage said: “Heartbreaking, I don’t know how to say how I feel. “My darling @thevivienne_ we go back to when I started coming over here to the UK. You were always there, always laughing, always giving, always on point. “Your laughter, your wit, your talent, your drag. I loved all of it but I loved your friendship most of all. You were a beacon to so many.” Coronation Street star Antony Cotton said the news was “unbelievably sad”, adding: “James was a real joy to be around. We loved him, x.” RuPaul’s Drag Race UK star Bimini Bon Boulash wrote on Instagram: “I’m so sorry I’m in total shock.” Emmerdale actor Lisa Riley wrote on Instagram: “You incredible human … rest in peace. Never stop shining your beautiful light over us all. Love and strength to all your family. We will miss you so much.” The ITV presenter Lorraine Kelly wrote on X: “Oh this is so sad – such a lovely, funny, whip smart and generous person. A delight to interview. My thoughts with everyone who loved The Vivienne.” Williams, who was born in north Wales, also starred in BBC Three show The Vivienne Takes on Hollywood in 2020, which saw them make their first music video. They were joined each week by a different celebrity, with guests including Broadway star Marissa Jaret Winokur and US comedian Bruce Vilanch. RuPaul’s Drag Race UK vs The World winner Tia Kofi said in a post on social media: “This is an incredible loss to the British drag community and to the world. “Viv represented UK drag at its absolute finest on stage and screen internationally. “She was a mentor, an inspiration and a friend. This shock will be felt deeply by us all. Love you Viv.” Speaking in 2019, The Vivienne said: “My style is like a scouse wife who has come into money, she moved to LA and blew it all and then she’s had to move back to Liverpool. “I like to have a really fierce look, but I like to be hilarious on stage so I’m kind of an old school and the new school put together which I think works. “Comedy is definitely my trump card. My favourite trick in drag is my vocal impersonations so I do everyone from Kim Woodburn, Cilla Black, Donald Trump: you name it, I’ll do it – for the right price.” Last January, a man who attacked Williams in a hate crime received a suspended jail sentence. Liverpool magistrates court found that the one-punch attack by Alan Whitfield, an unemployed scaffolder, on Williams was homophobic. Williams’s face was bruised and painful for a week, but they told the court that “luckily” they were a 6ft ex-rugby player who could take a punch.",

                "content": "PHILADELPHIA - The New York Giants have found nothing but frustration, agony and despair in Philadelphia over the past decade. There's now a total of 12 consecutive losses, including their playoff defeat that ended Brian Daboll's first season as head coach, for the Giants here at Lincoln Financial Field. Will this game represent the last one of Daboll’s tenure, or that of general manager Joe Schoen? We won't know that until Daboll and Schoen meet with Giants co-owners John Mara and Steve Tisch, which is expected to happen at some point this week, likely later Monday or possibly even Tuesday - so there may not be an immediate answer on their fates. What we do know: one of the worst seasons in Giants history - in a year where they hoped to celebrate their 100th year anniversary - has mercifully come to an end, poetically in the stadium where they have endured some of their greatest heartache in recent memory. The Giants (3-14) dropped a 20-13 decision to the Eagles, who rested most of their starters, including Saquon Barkley, in preparation for the playoffs. In terms of the Giants' lineup, their mixing and matching resembled that of a preseason game for much of the afternoon. By virtue of the Giants' defeat, they will pick no lower than No. 4 in the 2025 NFL Draft. A Patriots victory over the Bills - they're leading 20-16 in the fourth quarter - would allow the Giants to jump to No. 3 overall. The Giants have not won at Lincoln Financial Field since 2013, and on that day when they last did, Josh Brown kicked five field goals, Peyton Hillis was the leading rusher and Victor Cruz was the leading receiver for Tom Coughlin's team. Chip Kelly's offense with the Eagles was all the NFL could talk about. Michael Vick and Matt Barkley were at quarterback in place of an injured Nick Foles. And Eli Manning passed Phil Simms as the franchise's all-time leader in yards passing in that game. On Sunday, Giants rookie Malik Nabers established a new team record for receptions in a season (109), breaking the mark set by Steve Smith in 2009. He finished with five catches for 64 yards and a touchdown, ending his first campaign with 109 receptions, 1,204 yards and seven touchdowns. Here's how the rest of the game played out: Malik Nabers is in the end zone again, and yet again, he has done it in pretty spectacular fashion. The Giants' rookie caught a 45-yard touchdown from Drew Lock, absorbing a hit at the 10-yard line, keeping his balance along the sideline before diving into the end zone near the front right pylon for the score. He now has 109 catches on the season. One quarter left in what has been a brutal season for the Giants. Tanner McKee tossed his second touchdown of the game and the Eagles extended their lead. At this point, the defensive lineup for the Giants resembles a preseason game. The Eagles have been there from the start. Malik Nabers now has the most catches in a single season in Giants history, surpassing Steve Smith's previous mark of 107 set in 2009. Nabers is at 108 with his fourth reception and the Giants got on the board with a Graham Gano field goal. A lot of nothing going on, other than Malik Nabers surpassing what was Puka Nacua's rookie record for receptions with three catches. The Giants have 84 yards of total offense and Nabers is at 106, so he'll hold the mark for wide receivers. Raiders rookie tight end Brock Bowers broke Nacua's record last week and sits at 108 heading into today's action. The Eagles backups ... and Dallas Goedert, who has four catches for 55 yards in the first quarter, including a grab on fourth and 2 to keep the chains moving. Well, that was quick. After the Giants went for it and failed on a fourth-and-8 at midfield, the Eagles marched right down the field and found the end zone with Tanner McKee hitting Ainias Smith for the touchdown. GIANTS EAGLES The pick: Eagles 17, Giants 14 Why: The Eagles won't be playing many of their starters, and that includes Saquon Barkley, whose run at the NFL record should take a backseat to Philly's chances in the NFC playoffs. It's hard to imagine the Giants duplicating their performance from the victory over the Colts, although Malik Nabers needs four catches to set the Giants' single season record for receptions currently held by Steve Smith (107, 2009).

                "content": "The Philadelphia Eagles and the New York Giants met in Week 18 of the regular season, in a game without a lot of meaning for both teams. The Eagles, already qualified for the playoffs, rested almost all of their key starters ahead of the Wild Card Round game. The Giants, on the other hand, would not complain about a loss, as they wanted to keep themselves with a high pick in the 2025 NFL draft. Although neither team had much of an incentive in this game, with Philadelphia locked in the second NFC seed, it was a good opportunity to assess some of their backups and get ready for the January run. Looking to predict NFL playoff Scenarios? Try our NFL Playoff Predictor for real-time simulations and stay ahead of the game! The Giants had no real incentive to win this game, and they lost indeed. They did put up a fight in the second half, but ultimately, the Eagles did just enough to keep themselves afloat, even if most of their starters did not step foot into the game. Apart from his interception, Lock mostly played a solid game, with a great throw to Malik Nabers in a touchdown but not much impressive after. He will remain a backup in the NFL in 2025, but there's no chance he'll start the season as a starter for any team. With another good performance, Nabers finished the season with 109 receptions, 1,204 yards and seven touchdowns, playing with below-average quarterbacks throughout the year. Even if this isn't the most exciting season for New York fans, at least they can be happy with the young star receiver. Jalen Hurts was never going to play in this game, but Philadelphia decided to give the starting nod to McKee with Kenny Pickett suffering from a problem in the ribs. And he impressed, with 269 passing yards, two touchdowns and no turnovers. Dallas Goedert was one of the few starters who saw game-time in this Week 18 game. The team wanted to give him a few plays to, as they defined, \"knock off the rust\". The tight end has been injured, but he's an important player in the Eagles' scheme. Giants Nation!

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. FOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) The New England Patriots concluded a bitter season on a high note. It wasn't enough to save their coach's job. Joe Milton III passed for a touchdown and ran for another in his professional debut, and the Patriots cost themselves the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL draft with a 23-16 win over the AFC East champion Buffalo Bills on Sunday. Shortly thereafter, owner Robert Kraft fired coach Jerod Mayo after one season. “After the game I informed Jerod Mayo that he will not be returning as the head coach of the New England Patriots in 2025. For me, personally, it was one of the hardest decisions I have ever made,” Kraft said in a statement. “Unfortunately, the trajectory of our team’s performances throughout the season did not ascend as I had hoped.” The Patriots (4-13) snapped a six-game skid when a loss would have guaranteed them the top draft pick. Instead, they fell to No. 4 behind Tennessee, Cleveland and the New York Giants. Mayo held his postgame news conference before his firing was announced. He said draft position was not a focal point in the locker room heading into Sunday. “I’ve said this over the last couple of weeks, as a player, as a coach, we always want to go out there and win,” Mayo said. Milton finished 22 of 29 for 241 yards in relief of rookie Drake Maye, who played only one series. Kayshon Boutte had seven catches for 117 yards and a TD, and Joey Slye kicked three field goals. New England had four healthy scratches and rested other key players, including running back Rhamondre Stevenson. Tight end Hunter Henry was inactive with a foot issue. Describing what he called “an emotional” postgame locker room, Mayo said questions about his future would be addressed in due time. He may have already known that his time had ended. “These guys have been turning the page, ignoring the noise, and just coming to work every day, and I’m very appreciative of that,” Mayo said. “Told them after the first win of the season, coaches are nothing without the players, and I just told them that again. ... Also told them, today it’s all about the game.” Mitchell Trubisky was 15 of 21 for 101 yards for the Bills (13-4), who had already wrapped up the No. 2 seed in the AFC playoffs and rested most of their starters. Quarterback and MVP candidate Josh Allen played one snap, handing off to James Cook to extend his streak of consecutive starts to 115 games, including the playoffs. Trubisky played until late in the third quarter, when he was replaced by Mike White. Cook rushed for his 16th TD of the season to tie O.J. Simpson's Bills franchise record. The Patriots extended their lead to 23-16 with 1:55 left in the fourth quarter on a 50-yard field goal by Slye. The Bills then turned it over on downs when White’s pass fell incomplete. Bills coach Sean McDermott quickly turned his focus to next week. “Everything is earned and there’s nothing given in the playoffs,” he said. “And you’re going against the best every week, so we start with one week and really one day at a time and get back in here and find out when we play and take it one day at a time.” Patriots: S Marte Mapu left in the first quarter with a neck injury and was ruled out in the second half. WR Kayshon Boutte left in the fourth quarter with a head injury. Trubisky’s 2-yard touchdown pass to Ray Davis in the first quarter was the Bills' 30th passing TD, making them the first team in NFL history with 30 or more TDs through the air and on the ground in a season. Milton’s teammates have lauded the rookie’s athletic ability, though he hadn’t gotten to showcase it beyond the preseason and in closed sessions as a member of the Patriots’ practice squad. That changed Sunday. Taking over for Maye to begin New England’s second series, Milton had passes of 12 and 11 yards to get the Patriots near the goal line. He then capped the 13-play, 55-yard drive with a 1-yard run and celebrated his first career NFL TD with a backflip. He added a 48-yard TD pass to Kayshon Boutte in the second quarter that put New England in front 14-7. Bills veteran linebacker Von Miller earned a $1.5 million bonus with his sixth sack of the season, taking down Maye on the third play of the game. Bills punter Sam Martin also cashed in a $100,000 bonus in the third quarter for his 25th punt inside an opponent’s 20-yard line. Cornerback Ja’Marcus Ingram kept Martin’s 29-yard punt from rolling into the end zone and it was downed on the 6. The Bills passed up a 53-yard field goal attempt for the punt. Bills: Host the AFC's No. 7 seed next weekend. Patriots: An offseason of big decisions starts with finding a coach. --- AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl Copyright 2025 STATS LLC and Associated Press.

                "content": "Tampa Bay is a large natural harbor and shallow estuary connected to the Gulf of Mexico on the west-central coast of Florida, comprising Hillsborough Bay, McKay Bay, Old Tampa Bay, Middle Tampa Bay, and Lower Tampa Bay. The largest freshwater inflow into the bay is the Hillsborough River, which flows into Hillsborough Bay in downtown Tampa. Many other smaller rivers and streams also flow into Tampa Bay, resulting in a large watershed area. The shores of Tampa Bay were home to the Weeden Island Culture and then the Safety Harbor culture for thousands of years. These cultures relied heavily on Tampa Bay for food, and the waters were rich enough that they were one of the few Native American cultures that did not have to farm. The Tocobaga was likely the dominant chiefdom in the area when Spanish explorers arrived in the early 1500s, but there were likely smaller chiefdoms on the eastern side of the bay which were not well documented. The indigenous population had been decimated by disease and warfare by the late 1600s, and there were no permanent human settlements in the area for over a century. The United States took possession of Florida in 1821 and established Fort Brooke at the mouth of the Hillsborough River in 1824. The communities surrounding Tampa Bay grew tremendously during the 20th century. Today, the area is home to about 4 million residents, making Tampa Bay a heavily used commercial and recreational waterway and subjecting it to increasing amounts of pollutants from industry, agriculture, sewage, and surface runoff. The bay's water quality was seriously degraded by the early 1980s, resulting in a sharp decline in sea life and decreased availability for recreational use. Greater care has been taken in recent decades to mitigate the effects of human habitation on Tampa Bay, most notably upgraded sewage treatment facilities and several sea grass restoration projects, resulting in improved water quality over time. However, occasional red tide and other algae blooms have caused concern about the ongoing health of the estuary.[1] The term \"Tampa Bay\" is often used as shorthand to refer to all or parts of the Tampa Bay area, which comprises many towns and cities in several counties surrounding the large body of water. Local marketing and branding efforts (including several professional sports teams, tourist boards, and chambers of commerce) commonly use the moniker \"Tampa Bay\", furthering the misconception that it is the name of a particular municipality when this is not the case.[2][3] Tampa Bay formed approximately 6,000 years ago as a brackish drowned river valley type[4] estuary with a wide mouth connecting it to the Gulf of Mexico. Prior to that time, it was a large fresh water lake, possibly fed by the Floridan Aquifer through natural springs.[5] Though the exact process of the lake-to-bay transformation is not completely understood, the leading theory is that rising sea levels following the last ice age coupled with the formation of a massive sink hole near the current mouth of the bay created a connection between the lake and the gulf.[6] Tampa Bay is Florida's largest open-water estuary, extending over 400 square miles (1,000 km2) and forming coastlines of Hillsborough, Manatee and Pinellas counties. The freshwater sources of the bay are distributed among over a hundred small tributaries, rather than a single river.[7] The Hillsborough River is the largest such freshwater source, with the Alafia, Manatee, and Little Manatee rivers the next largest sources. Because of these many flows into the bay, its large watershed covers portions of five Florida counties[8] and approximately 2,200 square miles (5,700 km2). The bottom of Tampa Bay is silty and sandy, with an average water depth of only about 12 feet (3.7 m).[9] The relatively shallow water and tidal mud flats allow for large sea grass beds, and along with the surrounding mangrove-dominated wetlands, the bay provides habitat for a wide variety of wildlife. More than 200 species of fish are found in the waters of the bay, along with bottlenose dolphins and manatees, plus many types of marine invertebrates including oysters, scallops, clams, shrimp and crab. More than two dozen species of birds, including brown pelicans, several types of heron and egret, Roseate spoonbills, cormorants, and laughing gulls make their year-round home along its shores and small islands, with several other migratory species joining them in the winter. The cooler months are also when warm-water outfalls from power plants bordering the bay draw one out of every six West Indian manatees, an endangered species, to the area.[10] Tampa Bay was designated as an \"estuary of national significance\" by the United States Environmental Protection Agency in 1990. Two National Wildlife Refuges are located in Tampa Bay: Pinellas National Wildlife Refuge and the refuge on Egmont Key. Most of the islands (including several man-made islands built from dredge spoil[9][11]) and sandbars are off-limits to the public, due to their fragile ecology and their use as nesting sites by many species of birds. The Tampa Bay Estuary Program keeps watch over the Bay's health.[9] Tampa Bay was once teeming with fish and wildlife. People of the Safety Harbor culture lived almost entirely from mullet, shellfish, sea turtles, manatees, crabs, and other bounties harvested from the sea. As late as the early 20th century, visitors still reported huge schools of mullet swimming across the bay in such numbers that they \"impeded the passage of boats\".[12] The establishment and rapid growth of surrounding communities during the 20th century caused serious damage to the bay's natural environment. Heavy harvesting of fish and other sea life, constant dredging of shipping channels, and the clearing of mangroves for shoreline development were important factors.[13] Most damaging was the discharge of waste water and other pollutants into the bay, which drastically degraded water quality.[14] The bay's health reached a low point in the 1970s. The water was so murky that sunlight could not reach the shallow bottom, reducing sea grass coverage by more than 80% compared to earlier in the century and severely impacting the marine ecosystem. Many previously common species became scarce, and bay beaches were regularly closed due to unsafe levels of bacteria and pollutants.[14][15] Beginning in the early 1980s after federal and state legislation to improve water quality, authorities installed improved water treatment plants and tightened regulation of industrial discharge, leading to slow but steady improvement in water quality and general ecological health.[16] By 2010, measures of sea grass coverage, water clarity, and biodiversity had improved to levels last seen in the 1950s.[17] However, industrial and agricultural runoff along with runoff from developed areas pose a continuing threat to marine ecosystems in the bay, particularly by clouding the water with sediments and algae blooms, and seagrass coverage declined slightly in the late 2010s.[15][18][1] Wastewater pollution from old phosphate plants near the shoreline has been a particular problem. For example, in 2004, a leak of 65 million gallons of acidic water from a Cargill phosphate plant on the bay's southern shore severely impacted wetlands in the vicinity of the spill.[19] And in April 2021, a breach of a wastewater reservoir at the long-closed Piney Point phosphate plant sent over 200 millions gallons of nutrient-rich mine tailings streaming into lower Tampa Bay.[20] The resulting growth of red tide algae led to an ecocide and killed over 1000 tons of fish in the bay and along the nearby gulf coast and may lead to further damage to seagrass beds.[1] The effects of Hurricane Milton in October 2024 caused polluted waste from the fertilizer industry including products from Mosaic, which were retained after the production of phosphate, to enter into Tampa Bay. Both Hurricane Milton and Hurricane Helene caused disruption in the production of phosphate fertilizers from Tampa Bay.[21][22][23][24][25][26][27] Tampa Bay, like other parts of Florida, is extremely vulnerable to sea level rise caused by climate change.[18] The sea level has risen 8 inches (200 mm) since 1946.[18] Tampa Bay is also one of the areas in the US most at risk when hurricanes arrive because of its location, growing population, and the geography of the bay.[28][further explanation needed] The Tampa Bay Regional Resiliency Coalition coordinates the region's response to climate change.[29] Communities throughout the Bay, including St. Petersburg and Tampa are adapting infrastructure and buildings to face changes in sea level.[18] Humans have lived in Florida for millennia, at least 14,000 years. Due to worldwide glaciation, sea levels were much lower at the time, and Florida's peninsula extended almost 60 miles west of today's coastline. Paleo-Indian sites have been found near rivers and lakes in northern Florida, leading to speculation that these first Floridians also lived on Tampa Bay when it was still a freshwater lake.[30] Evidence of human habitation from this early period has been found at the Harney Flats site, which is approximately 10 miles east of the current location of Tampa's downtown waterfront.[31] The earliest evidence of human habitation directly on the shores of Tampa Bay comes from the Manasota culture, a variant of the Weeden Island culture, who lived in the area beginning around 5,000–6,000 years ago, after sea levels had risen to near modern levels and the bay was connected to the Gulf of Mexico.[32] This culture, which relied almost exclusively on the bay for food and other resources, was in turn replaced by the similar Safety Harbor culture by approximately 800 AD. The pre-contact Indigenous nation most associated with the Tampa Bay are the historic Tocobaga nation,[33] who are known to be among the ancestors of the contemporary Seminole and Miccosukee Tribes of Florida. [34] The Safety Harbor culture was dominant in the area at the time of first contact with Europeans in the mid-1500s. The Tocobaga, who built their principal town near today's Safety Harbor in the northwest corner of Old Tampa Bay, are the most documented group from that era because they had the most interactions with Spanish explorers. However, there were many other coastal villages organized into various small chiefdoms all around the bay.[35] Not finding gold or silver in the vicinity and unable to convert the native inhabitants to Christianity, the Spanish did not remain in the Tampa Bay area for long. However, diseases they introduced decimated the native population over the ensuing decades,[36] leading to the near-total collapse of every established culture across peninsular Florida. Between this depopulation and the indifference of its colonial owners, the Tampa Bay region would be virtually uninhabited for almost 200 years. Tampa Bay was given different names by early mapmakers. Spanish maps dated from 1584 identifies Tampa Bay as Baya de Spirito Santo (\"Bay of the Holy Spirit\").[37] A map dated 1695 identifies the area as Bahia Tampa.[38] Later maps dated 1794[39] and 1800[40] show the bay divided with three different names, Tampa Bay west of the Interbay peninsula and Hillsboro Bay on the east with an overall name of Bay of Spiritu Santo. At other times, the entire bay was identified as The Bay of Tocobaga.[41] The United States acquired Florida from Spain in 1821. The name Spirito Santo seems to have disappeared from maps of the region in favor of \"Tampa Bay\" (sometimes divided into Tampa and Hillsboro Bays) soon after the US established Fort Brooke at the mouth of the Hillsborough River in 1824.[42] For the next several decades, during the Seminole Wars, the Tampa Bay would be a primary point of confrontation, detention, and forced expulsion of the Seminole & Miccosukee people of Florida. Fort Brooke,[43] Fort Dade, and the American military's miscellaneous Egmont Key facilities [44][45] were the primary sites associated with the removal of the Seminole in the Floridian leg of the Trail of Tears.[46][47] For the next 100 years, many new communities were founded around the bay. Fort Brooke begat Tampa on the northeast shore, Fort Harrison (a minor military outpost on Florida's west coast) begat Clearwater, the trading post of \"Braden's Town\" developed into Bradenton on the south, and St. Petersburg grew quickly after its founding in the late 19th century, on the western bay shore opposite Tampa. By 2010, the Tampa Bay Area was home to over 4 million residents. As Tampa began to grow in the mid-1800s, roads across central Florida were still just rough trails and rail lines did not yet extend down the Florida peninsula, so the most convenient means of traveling to and from the area was by sea. By the late 19th century, however, the shallow nature of Tampa Bay made it impossible for large modern vessels with deeper drafts to reach the city of Tampa's downtown wharves on Hillsboro Bay. Most ships would anchor well out from shore and transfer cargo and passengers to and from the city in smaller boats.[12] Henry B. Plant's railroad line reached the area in 1884 and ran across the Interbay Peninsula to Old Tampa Bay, where he built the town and shipping facility of Port Tampa at its terminus.[48] In 1898, Plant used his connections in the federal government to make Port Tampa a major embarkation point for the U.S. Army during the Spanish–American War, leading to the U.S. Congress appropriating funds for the United States Army Corps of Engineers to begin the first large dredging operation in Tampa Bay. A deep shipping channel was created which linked Port Tampa to the mouth of the bay, enabling Plant to greatly expand his steamship line.[49][50] In 1917, the Corps of Engineers dredged another channel from the mouth of Tampa Bay to the Port of Tampa, instantly making the city an important shipping center. The Corps of Engineers currently maintains more than 80 miles of deep-water channels in Tampa Bay up to a depth of 47 feet. These must be continuously re-dredged and deepened due to the sandy nature of the bay bottom. While dredging has enabled seaborne commerce to become an important part of the Tampa Bay area's economy, it has also damaged the bay's water quality and ecology. More care has been taken in recent decades to lessen the environmental impact of dredging.[51] Dredged material has also been used to create several spoil islands on the eastern side of Hillsboro Bay. These islands have become important nesting sites for many seabirds, including threatened species such as oystercatchers, and have been designated as \"sanctuary islands\" that are off-limits to boaters.[52][53] In the early 20th century, traveling overland between the growing communities around Tampa Bay was an arduous process. The trip between Tampa and St. Petersburg was almost 50 miles (80 km) around the north end of Old Tampa Bay and took up to 12 hours by train and over a full day over uncertain roads by car.[58][59] The trip between St. Petersburg and Bradenton was even longer – over 70 miles (110 km) all the way around Tampa Bay, a trip that still took about two hours into the 1950s.[60] In 1924, the Gandy Bridge over Old Tampa Bay reduced the driving distance between Tampa and St. Petersburg to 19 miles (31 km).[61] Ten years later, the Davis Causeway (later renamed the Courtney Campbell Causeway) was built between Clearwater and Tampa. More bridges criss-crossed Tampa Bay over the ensuing decades, making travel between the surrounding communities much faster and furthering the economic development of the Tampa Bay area. The difficulty of traveling between Tampa and St. Petersburg in the early 20th century inspired the world's first scheduled air service, the St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line, which operated during the tourist season of 1914.[58][59] While the construction of bridges made air travel across Tampa Bay unnecessary, several airports have been built along the shoreline. Albert Whitted Airport on the St. Petersburg waterfront and Peter O. Knight Airport on Davis Island near downtown Tampa were both established in the 1930s. Later, Tampa International Airport and St. Pete–Clearwater International Airport were established on opposite sides of Old Tampa Bay, and MacDill Air Force Base opened on the southern tip of Tampa's Interbay Peninsula.",

                "content": "Tampa (/ˈtæmpə/ ⓘ TAM-pə) is a city on the Gulf Coast of the U.S. state of Florida. Tampa's borders include the north shore of Tampa Bay and the east shore of Old Tampa Bay. Tampa is the largest city in the Tampa Bay area and the county seat of Hillsborough County. With an estimated population of 403,364 in 2023, Tampa is the 49th-most populous city in the country and the third-most populous city in Florida after Jacksonville and Miami. Tampa was founded as a military center in the 19th century, with the establishment of Fort Brooke. The cigar industry was brought to Tampa by Vincente Martinez Ybor, after whom Ybor City is named. Tampa was reincorporated as a city in 1887 following the Civil War. Tampa's economy is driven by tourism, health care, finance, insurance, technology, construction, and the maritime industry.[12] The bay's port is the largest in the state, responsible for over $15 billion in economic impact.[13] Tampa is part of the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is a four-county area composed of roughly 3.1 million residents,[14] making it the second-largest metropolitan statistical area (MSA) in the state and the sixth largest in the Southeastern United States, behind Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Washington D.C., Atlanta, and Miami.[15] The Greater Tampa Bay area has over 4 million residents, and generally includes the Tampa and Sarasota metro areas. The earliest instance of the name \"Tampa\", in the form \"Tanpa\", appears in the memoirs of Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda, who spent 17 years as a captive of the Calusa and traveled through much of peninsular Florida. He described Tanpa as an important Calusa town to the north of the Calusa domain, possibly under another chief. Archaeologist Jerald Milanich places the town of Tanpa at the mouth of Charlotte Harbor. The entrances to Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor are obscured by barrier islands, and their locations, and the names applied to them, were a source of confusion to explorers, surveyors and map-makers from the 16th century to the 18th century. Bahía Tampa and Bahía de Espíritu Santo were each used, at one time or another, for the modern Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor.[16][17] Tampa Bay was labeled Bahía de Espíritu Santo (Bay of the Holy Spirit) in the earliest Spanish maps of Florida. It became known as B. Tampa (Bahía Tampa or Tampa Bay) as early as 1576.[18][19] In 1601, \"B. Tampa\", corresponding to Tampa Bay, appeared for the first time on a printed map in Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas's Description del Destricto del Audiencia de la Espanola, from his book Descripcion de las Indias Ocidentales, printed in Madrid.[20] A 1705 British map also shows B. Tampa, with \"Carlos Bay\" for Charlotte Harbor to the south. A 1748 British map had \"B. del Spirito Santo\" for Tampa Bay and \"Carlos Bay\" to the south. A Spanish map of 1757 renamed Tampa Bay as \"San Fernando\". As late as 1774, Bernard Romans called Tampa Bay \"Bay of Espiritu Santo\", with \"Tampa Bay\" restricted to the Northwest arm, what is now Old Tampa Bay, and the northeast arm named \"Hillsborough Bay\". The name may have come from the Calusa language or possibly, the Timucua language. Some scholars have compared \"Tampa\" to \"itimpi\", which means \"close to\" or \"nearby\" in the Creek language, but its meaning is not known.[17] In 1849, when the pioneer community living near the U.S. Army outpost of Fort Brooke was incorporated, it was called \"Tampa Town\". In 1855, the name was shortened to simply \"Tampa\".[16][17] People from Tampa are generally known as \"Tampans\", \"Tampanians\", or \"Tampeños\".[21] In 2014, local authorities consulted by Michael Kruse of the Tampa Bay Times suggest that \"Tampan\" was historically more common, while \"Tampanian\" became popular when the former term came to be seen as a potential insult.[22] A mix of Cuban, Italian, and Spanish immigrants began arriving in the late 1800s to found and work in the new communities of Ybor City and West Tampa. By about 1900, these newcomers came to be known as \"Tampeños\", or \"Tampeñas\" for females, a term that is still sometimes used to refer to their descendants living in the area, and potentially, to all residents of Tampa regardless of their ethnic background.[22][23][24][7] The shores of Tampa Bay have been inhabited for thousands of years. A variant of the Weeden Island culture developed in the area by about 2,000 years ago. Archeological evidence suggests that these residents relied on the sea for most of their resources, as a vast majority of inhabited sites have been found on or near the shoreline, with little evidence of farming. At the time of European contact in the early 16th century, several chiefdoms of the Safety Harbor culture dominated the area.[25] Early Spanish explorers interacted most extensively with the Tocobaga, whose principal town was at the northern end of Old Tampa Bay near today's Safety Harbor in Pinellas County. While there is a substantial historical record of the Tocobaga, and the Calusa, who lived to the south, there is less surviving documentation describing the Pohoy, who lived near the mouth of the Hillsborough River near today's downtown Tampa. Evidence suggests that the language and culture of the Pohoy and other lesser-known groups around the bay were very similar to that of the Tocobaga.[26][27] Expeditions led by Pánfilo de Narváez and Hernando de Soto landed near Tampa, but neither conquistador stayed long. There is no natural gold or silver in Florida, and the native inhabitants repulsed Spanish attempts to establish a permanent settlement or convert them to Catholicism. The fighting resulted in a few deaths, but the many more deaths were caused by infectious diseases brought from Europe, which devastated the population of Native Americans across Florida and the entire Western Hemisphere. The indigenous cultures of the Tampa Bay area collapsed by around 1600, leaving the west coast of Spanish Florida largely depopulated and ignored for more than 200 years.[28] In the mid-18th century, events in the American colonies and the early United States drove the Seminole people into northern Florida. They did not move into central Florida until after the United States gained control of Florida in 1821.[29][30] Before the American period, the Tampa Bay area had a handful of residents: Cuban and Native American fishermen who established small seasonal camps called \"ranchos\" on the shores of Tampa Bay. The largest was at the mouth of Spanishtown Creek in today's Hyde Park neighborhood along Bayshore Boulevard.[31] After purchasing Florida from Spain in 1821, the United States built forts and trading posts in the new territory.[32] Fort Brooke was established in January 1824 at the mouth of the Hillsborough River on Tampa Bay, in Downtown Tampa.[33] Tampa was initially an isolated frontier outpost. The sparse civilian population practically abandoned the area during the Second Seminole War from 1835 to 1842, after which the Seminoles were forced out and many settlers returned.[34] Florida became the 27th state on March 3, 1845. On January 18, 1849, Tampa was officially incorporated as the \"Village of Tampa.\" It was home to 185 civilians, or 974 total residents including military personnel, in 1850.[35][36] Tampa was reincorporated as a town on December 15, 1855.[37] During the Civil War, Florida seceded along with most of the southern states to form the Confederate States of America, and Fort Brooke was defended by Confederate troops. Martial law was declared in Tampa in January 1862, and Tampa's city government ceased to operate for the duration of the war.[38] In 1861, the Union Navy set up a blockade around many southern ports to cut off the Confederacy. Several US Navy ships were stationed near the mouth of Tampa Bay, but small blockade running ships were often able to slip by the blockade to deliver cattle to Spanish Cuba, earning gold for the Confederate cause.[39][40][41] On June 30, 1862, the gunboat USS Sagamore sailed into Tampa Bay and opened fire on Fort Brooke, which returned fire. The Sagamore withdrew after a few hours, and the Battle of Tampa caused little damage. During the Battle of Fort Brooke on October 16 and the Battle of Ballast Point on October 18, 1863, Union forces inflicted serious damage to Tampa's economy when, under the cover of another bombardment of the fort, troops landed and destroyed two blockade running ships that had been hidden upstream along the Hillsborough River.[42] In May 1864, Union troops landed again and took Fort Brooke largely unopposed. They destroyed much of the fort's facilities and confiscated the remaining military supplies other than the cannons, which they tossed into the Hillsborough River, then left the \"desolate\" town after two days.[43] The Civil War ended in April 1865 with a Confederate defeat. In May 1865, federal troops arrived in Tampa to occupy the fort and the town as part of Reconstruction. They remained until August 1869.[citation needed] During the immediate post-war period, Tampa was a poor, isolated fishing village with about 1,000 residents and little industry. Yellow fever, borne by mosquitoes from nearby swamps, broke out several times during the 1860s and 1870s, causing more residents to leave.[44] In 1869, residents voted to abolish the city of Tampa government.[45] In 1870, the population of \"Tampa Town\" was about 800, and dropped to about 700 by 1880. Fort Brooke was decommissioned in 1883, further impacting the local economy in the short run, but opening up the waterfront for development. Except for two cannons displayed on the University of Tampa campus, all traces of the fort are gone.[43] In the mid-1880s, Tampa's fortunes took several sudden turns for the better. In 1883, phosphate was discovered in the Bone Valley region southeast of Tampa. The mineral, vital for the production of fertilizers and other products, was soon being shipped from the Port of Tampa in great volume. Tampa is still a major phosphate exporter. The discovery of phosphate, the arrival of Plant's railroad, and the founding of Ybor City and West Tampa—all in the mid-1880s—were crucial to Tampa's development. The once-struggling village of Tampa became a bustling boomtown almost overnight and had grown into one of the largest cities in Florida by 1900.[46] In late 1883, Henry B. Plant's narrow-gauge South Florida Railroad reached Tampa and its port, connecting the small town to the nation's railroad system after years of efforts by local leaders. Previously, Tampa's overland transportation links had consisted of sandy roads stretching across the Florida countryside. Plant's railroad made it much easier to get goods in and out of the Tampa Bay area. Phosphate and commercial fishing exports could be sent north by rail,[47] and many new products were brought into the Tampa market, along with the first tourists. The new railroad link enabled another important industry to come to Tampa. In 1885, the Tampa Board of Trade enticed Vicente Martinez Ybor to move his cigar manufacturing operations to Tampa from Key West. Proximity to Cuba made importation of \"clear Havana tobacco\" easy by sea, and Plant's railroad made shipment of finished cigars to the rest of the US market easy by land.[46] Since Tampa was still a small town at the time, with a population less than 5,000, Ybor built hundreds of small houses around his factory to accommodate the immediate influx of mainly Cuban and Spanish cigar workers. Ybor City's factories rolled their first cigars in 1886, and many different cigar manufacturers moved their operations to town in ensuing years. Many Italian and a few Eastern European Jewish immigrants arrived starting in the late 1880s, opening businesses and shops that catered to cigar workers.[48] By 1900, over 10,000 immigrants had moved to the neighborhood. Several thousand more Cuban immigrants built West Tampa, another cigar-centric suburb founded a few years later by Hugh MacFarlane. Between them, two \"Latin\" communities combined to exponentially expand Tampa's population, economic base, and tax revenues, as Tampa became the \"Cigar Capital of the World\".[48] During the first few decades of the 20th century, the cigar-making industry was the backbone of Tampa's economy. The factories in Ybor City and West Tampa made an enormous number of cigars—in the peak year of 1929, over 500 million cigars were hand rolled in Tampa.[49] In 1904, a civic association of local businessmen dubbed themselves Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla, named after local mythical pirate José Gaspar, and staged an \"invasion\" of the city followed by a parade. With a few exceptions, the Gasparilla Pirate Festival has been held every year since.[50] Beginning in the late 19th century, illegal bolita lotteries were very popular among the Tampa working classes, especially in Ybor City. In the early 1920s, this small-time operation was taken over by Charlie Wall, the rebellious son of a prominent Tampa family, and went big-time. Bolita was able to openly thrive only because of kick-backs and bribes to key local politicians and law enforcement officials, and many were on the take.[51] Profits from the bolita lotteries and Prohibition-era bootlegging led to the development of several organized crime factions in Tampa. Charlie Wall was the first major boss, but various power struggles culminated in consolidation of control by Sicilian mafioso Santo Trafficante Sr. and his faction in the 1950s. After his death in 1954 from cancer, control passed to his son, Santo Trafficante Jr., who established alliances with families in New York City and extended his power throughout Florida and into Batista-era Cuba.[52][53] The era of rampant and open corruption ended in the 1950s, when Estes Kefauver's traveling organized crime hearings came to town and were followed by the sensational misconduct trials of several local officials. Although many of the worst offenders in government and the mob were not charged, the trials helped to end the sense of lawlessness which had prevailed in Tampa for decades.[51] Tampa grew considerably as a result of World War II. Prior to the United States' involvement in the conflict, construction began on MacDill Field, which served as a main base for Army Air Corps and later Army Air Forces operations just before and during World War II, with multiple auxiliary airfields around the Tampa Bay area and surrounding counties. At the end of the war, MacDill remained as an active military installation, while the auxiliary fields reverted to civilian control. Two of these auxiliary fields later became the present-day Tampa International Airport and St. Petersburg–Clearwater International Airport. With the establishment of an independent U.S. Air Force in 1947, MacDill Field became MacDill Air Force Base. In the 1950s and 1960s, Tampa had record-setting population growth that has not been seen since. This growth spurred expansion of Tampa's highways and bridges, bringing thousands into the city and creating opportunities for Tampa business owners, who welcomed the influx of tourists and new residents. It was during this time period in Tampa's history that two of the most popular tourist attractions in the area were developed – Busch Gardens and Lowry Park. Many of the well-known institutions that play an important role in the economic development of Tampa were established during this time period.[54] The University of South Florida was established in North Tampa in 1956 and opened for students in September 1960.[55] The school spurred the construction of several residential and commercial developments in the previously agriculture-dominated area around the new campus. Overall, Tampa continued to expand away from the city center during the 1960s as new hospitals, schools, churches and subdivisions all began appearing to accommodate the growth. Many business offices began moving away from the traditional downtown office building into more convenient neighborhood office plazas.[54] In 1970, the U.S. Census Bureau reported Tampa's population as being 80.0% white and 19.7% black.[56] Four attempts have been made to consolidate the municipal government of the city of Tampa with the county government of Hillsborough County, in 1967, 1970, 1971, and 1972, all of which failed at the ballot box. The greatest loss was the most recent attempt in 1972, with the final tally being 33,160 (31%) in favor and 73,568 (69%) against the proposed charter.[57] The biggest recent growth of Tampa was the development of New Tampa, which started in 1988 when the city annexed a mostly rural area of 24 sq mi (62 km2) between I-275 and I-75.[citation needed] East Tampa, historically a mostly black community, was the scene of several race riots during and for some time after the period of racial segregation, mainly due to problems between residents and the Tampa Police Department.[58][59] According to the United States Census Bureau, Tampa has a total area of 175.3 sq mi (453.9 km2), including 113.4 sq mi (293.7 km2) of land and 61.8 sq mi (160.1 km2) (35.3%) of water.[10] The highest point in Tampa is only 48 ft (15 m) above sea level. Tampa is bordered by two bodies of water, Old Tampa Bay and Hillsborough Bay, which flow together to form Tampa Bay, which flows into the Gulf of Mexico.[60] The Hillsborough River flows into Hillsborough Bay, passing directly in front of Downtown Tampa and supplying Tampa's main source of fresh water. The Palm River is a smaller river, flowing from just east of the city into McKay Bay, which is a smaller inlet, sited at the northeast end of Hillsborough Bay.[60] Tampa's geography is marked by the Interbay Peninsula, which divides Hillsborough Bay in the east, from Old Tampa Bay in the west. Tampa is divided into many neighborhoods, many of which were towns and unincorporated communities annexed by the growing city. Generally, Tampa is divided into the following areas: Downtown Tampa, New Tampa, West Tampa, East Tampa, North Tampa, and South Tampa. Well-known neighborhoods include Ybor City, Forest Hills, Ballast Point, Sulphur Springs, Seminole Heights, Tampa Heights, Palma Ceia, Hyde Park, Davis Islands, Harbour Island, Tampa Palms, College Hill, Water Street, Channelside and non-residential areas of Gary and the Westshore Business District. Tampa displays a wide variety of architectural designs and styles. Most of Tampa's high rises demonstrate post-modern architecture. The design for the renovated Tampa Museum of Art displays post-modern architecture, while the city hall and the Tampa Theatre belong to Art Deco architecture. The Tampa mayor Pam Iorio made the redevelopment of Tampa's downtown, especially residential development, a priority.[61] Several residential and mixed-development high-rises have been constructed. Another of Mayor Iorio's initiatives was the Tampa Riverwalk, a mixed-use path along the Hillsborough River in downtown. Channelside was approved to undergo major renovations by Tampa Bay Lightning owner Jeff Vinik along with Bill Gates and other investors.[62] Several museums have opened, including new homes for the Tampa Bay History Center, the Glazer Children's Museum, and the Tampa Museum of Art.[63] The breakdown of development for the rest of the plan is as follows: 39% residential units, 29% office space, 15% hotels, 8% retail, 7% other, and 2% cultural uses.[64] Mayor Bob Buckhorn continued these developments, which are bearing fruit during the term of Mayor Jane Castor. Tampa is the site of several skyscrapers. Overall, there are 30 completed buildings that rise over 250 ft (76 m) high. Tampa also has 147 high-rises,[65] second only to Miami in the state of Florida. The tallest building in the city is 100 North Tampa, formerly the AmSouth Building, which rises 42 floors and 579 ft (176 m) in Downtown Tampa.[66] The structure was completed in 1992, and is the tallest building in Florida outside of Miami and Jacksonville.[66] The Sulphur Springs Water Tower, a landmark in the Sulphur Springs section of the city, stands 214 feet tall and was built by Grover Poole in the late 1920s.[67] This 1920s boom period for Florida also saw the construction of an ornate movie palace, the Tampa Theatre, a Mediterranean revival on Davis Islands, and Bayshore Boulevard, which borders Hillsborough Bay from downtown Tampa to areas in South Tampa. The road has a 6 mi (10 km) continuous sidewalk on the eastern end, the longest in the world.[68][69] The Ybor City District is home to several buildings on the National Register of Historic Places and has been declared a National Historic Landmark. Notable structures include El Centro Español de Tampa, Centro Asturiano de Tampa and other social clubs built in the early 1900s. Including L'Unione Italiana or the Italian Club, at 1731 East 7th Avenue in Ybor City. The Italian Club mission \"is to preserve and honor the culture, traditions and heritage of the Italian Community and to maintain the historical facility as a functioning memorial to the working class immigrants.\"[70] Babe Zaharias Golf Course in the Forest Hills area of Tampa has been designated a Historical Landmark by the National Register of Historic Places. It was bought in 1949 by the famous \"Babe\" Didrikson Zaharias, who had a residence nearby, and closed upon her death. In 1974, the city of Tampa opened the golf course to the public.[71] The Story of Tampa, a public painting by Lynn Ash, is a 4 ft × 8 ft (1.2 m × 2.4 m) oil on masonite mural that weaves together many of the notable aspects of Tampa's unique character and identity. It was commissioned in 2003 by the city's Public Art Program and is in the lobby of the Tampa Municipal Office Building.[72] Park Tower, originally the First Financial Bank of Florida, is the first substantial skyscraper in downtown Tampa. Completed in 1973, it was the tallest skyscraper in Tampa until the completion of One Tampa City Center in 1981.[73] The Rivergate building, a cylindrical structure known as the \"Beer Can building\", was featured in the movie The Punisher. Spanning the southern part of Tampa Bay is the massive steel-span Sunshine Skyway Bridge. Tampa is home to the Bro Bowl, one of the last remaining skateparks built during skateboarding's \"Golden Era\" in the 1970s.[74] It opened in 1979 and was constructed by Tampa Parks and Recreation in 1978.[75] It was the first public skatepark to be constructed in Florida and the third on the East Coast.[76] Other Tampa landmarks include the Tampa Riverwalk, which is a 2.6-mile-long (4.2 km) open space and pedestrian trail development along the Hillsborough River, and Curtis Hixon Waterfront Park. The Tampa Bay area has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa), although due to its location on the Florida peninsula on Tampa Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, it shows some characteristics of a tropical climate. Tampa has hot and humid summers with frequent thunderstorms and dry and mild winters. Average highs range from 71 to 91 °F (22 to 33 °C) year round, and lows 53 to 77 °F (12 to 25 °C). The city of Tampa is split between two USDA climate zones. In the 2012 USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map, Tampa is listed as USDA zone 9b north of Kennedy Boulevard away from the bay and 10a near the shorelines and in the interbay peninsula south of Kennedy Boulevard. Zone 10a is about the northern limit of where coconut palms and royal palms can be grown, although some specimens do grow in northern Tampa. Recently, certain palm tree species in the area, along with the rest of the state, have been and continue to be severely affected by a plant disease called Texas phoenix palm decline, which has caused a considerable amount of damage to various local palm tree landscapes and threatens the native palm tree species in the region.[77] Though threatened by tropical systems almost every hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30, Tampa has seldom felt major effects from tropical storms or hurricanes. No hurricane has made landfall in the immediate Tampa Bay area since the category 4 1921 Tampa Bay hurricane made landfall near Tarpon Springs and caused extensive damage throughout the region.[78][79] Over the past few decades, four major hurricanes were forecast to hit the Tampa Bay area from the south-southwest, which is a worse-case track that would result in a maximum storm surge event: Hurricane Donna (1960), Hurricane Charley (2004), Hurricane Irma (2017), and Hurricane Ian (2022).[80][81] All of these storms veered to the east or northeast before reaching Tampa Bay and instead made landfall down the coast, resulting in serious damage in southwest Florida. Irma had the greatest effect on Tampa. It made landfall near Marco Island on September 10, 2017, and moved due north, passing through eastern Hillsborough County as a Category 1 storm and causing widespread issues in the area, particularly disrupting the electrical grid for several days.[82] Because of tremendous population growth and coastal development in the century since the last hurricane landfall, combined with rising sea levels due to climate change, the Tampa Bay Area is considered one of the most vulnerable regions in the world to a direct hit from a major storm.[78] Summertime weather patterns predominate from late May to early October, which is the region's rainy season.[83] Daily weather is very consistent during this period, with daytime highs averaging about 91 °F (33 °C), lows usually in the mid- to upper 70s °F (23–25 °C), high humidity, and a regular chance of rain, especially in the afternoon. Mainly due to the proximity of large bodies of water, the official high temperature has never hit 100 °F (37.8 °C) – the all-time record high temperature is 99 °F (37 °C), first recorded on June 5, 1985, and tied on June 26, 2020.[84] Afternoon thunderstorms are regularly generated by the interaction of the Gulf and Atlantic sea breezes and are such a regular occurrence during the summer that the Tampa Bay area and nearby inland areas of Central Florida are recognized as the \"Lightning Capital of North America\". Afternoon thundershowers occasionally intensify into a severe thunderstorm, bringing heavy downpours, frequent lightning, strong straight-line winds, and sometimes hail.[85] Average temperatures gradually fall beginning in September, and average daily rainfall amounts decrease as autumn progresses. November is usually Tampa's driest month. However, rain totals in the fall can be augmented by passing tropical systems, which can dump several inches of rain. Winter in the area is generally dry and cooler. Average high temperatures range from the low to mid-70s °F (21–23 °C) during the day to the low to mid-50s °F (11–13 °C) at night. Occasional cold fronts push through the area during the season, usually bringing a brief period of rain followed by daytime highs in the 50s °F (10–13 °C) and nighttime lows near 40 °F (5 °C) for a day or two. Tampa experiences occasional frosts, with an annual mean minimum temperature of 32.8 °F (0.4 °C) Since the Tampa area is home to a diverse range of freeze-sensitive agriculture and aquaculture, hard freezes, although quite rare, are a major concern. Hard freezes, defined as a temperature of 28 °F (−2.2 °C) or below for several hours, occur rarely in the Tampa area, every five to twenty years depending on the exact location. The last widespread freeze occurred on the morning of January 18, 2018, when the official temperature at Tampa International Airport dropped to 29 °F (−2 °C).[86][87] The lowest temperature ever recorded in Tampa was 18 °F (−8 °C) on December 13, 1962.[85] The only snowfall officially recorded in Tampa occurred on January 19, 1977, with local accumulations ranging between a trace and 0.2 in (0.5 cm).[88] Tampa has a slow increase in average temperatures beginning in mid-February, and spring brings mostly warm and sunny weather to the area. While temperatures in late spring approach summertime values, the rainy season does not usually begin until June, leading to the threat of brush fires from approximately late March until May. Occasionally, a late-season cold front pushes through the area, potentially bringing a brief round of severe weather followed by a few days of unseasonably cool temperatures. Tampa first appeared in the 1850 U.S. Census with a total recorded population of 974, which included soldiers stationed at Fort Brooke.[96] Tampa did not report separately in 1860.[97] In the 2020 United States census, there were 384,959 people, 156,705 households, and 85,195 families living in Tampa.[101] The U.S. Census accounts for race by two methodologies: \"Race alone\" where Hispanics are allocated to the various racial categories and \"Race alone less Hispanics\" where Hispanics are excluded from the racial categories and delineated separately as if a separate race. In the 2020 U.S. Census, the racial makeup, including Hispanics in the racial counts, was 49.70% (191,309) White alone, 21.91% (84,340) Black alone, 0.41% (1,563) Native American alone, 5.43% (20,895) Asian alone, 0.08% (308) Pacific Islander alone, 7.63% (29,385) Other Race alone, and 14.85% (57,159) Multiracial or Mixed Race.[102] In the 2020 U.S. Census, the racial and ethnic makeup, where Hispanics are excluded from the racial counts and placed in their own category, was 43.32% (166,775) White alone (non-Hispanic), 20.93% (80,583) Black alone (non-Hispanic), 0.19% (741) Native American alone (non-Hispanic), 5.35% (20,587) Asian alone (non-Hispanic), 0.06% (246) Pacific Islander alone (non-Hispanic), 0.71% (2,746) Other Race alone (non-Hispanic), 3.81% (14,660) Multiracial or Mixed Race (non-Hispanic), and 25.62% (98,621) Hispanic or Latino.[100] In the 2010 United States census, there were 335,709 people, 133,277 households, and 75,562 families living in Tampa.[103] In 2006, the median income for a household in Tampa was $39,602, and the median income for a family was $45,823. Males had a median income of $40,461 versus $29,868 for females. The per capita income for Tampa was $26,522. 20.1% of the population and 16.4% of families were below the poverty line. 31.0% of those under the age of 18 and 13.6% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty level. In 2000, the racial makeup of Tampa was 64.22% White (51.0% White Non-Hispanic), 26.07% Black or African American, 0.38% American Indian and Alaska Native, 2.15% Asian, 0.09% Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander, 4.17% from other races, and 2.92% from two or more races. 19.29% of the population are Hispanic or Latino of any race. The largest European ancestries in the city as of 2000 were German (9.2%), Irish (8.4%), English (7.7%), Italian (5.6%), and French (2.4%).[104] In 2000, 27.6% households had children under the age of 18 living with them, 36.4% were married couples living together, 16.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 42.9% were non-families. 33.7% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.36 and the average family size was 3.07. In 2000, 24.6% of Tampa's population was under the age of 18, 10.0% aged from 18 to 24, 32.3% from 25 to 44, 20.5% from 45 to 64, and 12.5% were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34.7 years old. For every 100 females, there were 95.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 92.1 males. In 2000, those who spoke only English at home accounted for 77.4% of all residents, while 22.6% spoke other languages in their homes. Spanish speakers were 17.8% of the population. Both French and Italian were each spoken by 0.6% of the population.[105] Communities of faith have organized in Tampa from 1846, when a Methodist congregation established the city's first church,[106] to 1939, when a 21-year-old Billy Graham began his career as a spiritual evangelist and preacher on downtown's Franklin Street,[107] and through to today. Among Tampa's noteworthy religious structures are Sacred Heart Catholic Church, a 1905 downtown landmark noted for its soaring, Romanesque revival construction in granite and marble with German-crafted stained glass windows,[108] the distinctive rock and mortar St. James Episcopal House of Prayer, listed with the National Register of Historic Places,[109] and the St. Paul AME church, which has seen the likes of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.[107] and President Bill Clinton speak from its pulpit.[110] The latter two have been designated by the city government as Local Landmark Structures.[111] Tampa's religious community includes a broad representation of Christian denominations, including those above, and Baptist, Presbyterian, Lutheran, Christian Science, Church of God, United Church of Christ, Philippine Independent Church, Metropolitan Community Church, Seventh-day Adventist, Eastern Orthodox (Greek, Coptic, Syrian, and OCA), various Pentecostal movements, Anglicans, the Quakers, Jehovah's Witnesses, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. There is also at least one congregation of Messianic Jews in Tampa.[112] There is a Korean Baptist church,[113][114] a Mennonite church, several Haitian churches, and a Vietnamese Baptist Church.[115] Tampa has several Jewish synagogues practicing Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform.[116] There is a small Zoroastrian community present in Tampa.[117] as well as several Unitarian Universalist congregations Around the city are a handful of mosques for followers of Islam, as well as a Tibetan-style Buddhist temple, a Thai Buddhist Wat,[118] and local worship centers for the Sikh,[119] Hindu and Baháʼí Faiths. The Church of Scientology, based in nearby Clearwater, maintains a location for its members in Tampa.[120] In 2012, Tampa was 50th out of the largest 51 metropolitan areas in the percentage of the populace that attends religious services of any kind, with less than 35% of the population regularly attending services. Only the Portland, Oregon area is less observant.[121] Finance, retail, healthcare, insurance, shipping by air and sea, national defense, professional sports, tourism, and real estate all play vital roles in the area's economy.[122] Hillsborough County alone has an estimated 740,000 employees, a figure which is projected to increase to 922,000 by 2015.[122] Since the year 2000, Tampa has seen a notable upsurge in high-market demand from consumers, signaling more wealth concentrated in the area.[123] In 2021, the U.S. Department of Labor awarded a two-year grant of nearly US$3 million to a program called \"Connecting Talent to Careers\" led by the Advanced Robotics for Manufacturing Institute and Tooling U-SME to deliver a rapid re-employment program to address a shortage of skilled labor in manufacturing in the region exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.[124] Several large corporations, such as banks and telecommunications companies, maintain regional offices in Tampa. The largest credit union in Florida, Suncoast Credit Union, is headquartered in Tampa. Several Fortune 1000 companies are headquartered in the metropolitan area,[125] including Bloomin' Brands, WellCare, Jabil, TECO Energy, and Raymond James Financial. Other companies headquartered in Tampa include Odyssey Marine Exploration, Greenway Health, College Hunks Hauling Junk, Arturo Fuente, J.C. Newman Cigar Company, Masonite International, Sykes Enterprises, Cott Corporation, Blue Rock Partners,[126] The Melting Pot, Checkers and Rally's and The Mosaic Company Downtown Tampa is undergoing significant development and redevelopment in line with a general national trend toward urban residential development. In April 2007, the Tampa Downtown Partnership noted development proceeding on 20 residential, hotel, and mixed-use projects.[128] Many of the new downtown developments were nearing completion in the midst of a housing market slump, which caused numerous projects to be delayed or revamped, and some of the 20 projects TDP lists have not broken ground and are being refinanced. Nonetheless, several developments were completed, making downtown into a 24-hour neighborhood instead of a 9 to 5 business district.[129] As of 2010[update], Tampa residents faced a decline in rent of 2%. Nationally rent had decreased 4%.[130] The Tampa Business Journal found Tampa to be the number two city for real estate investment in 2014.[131] Port Tampa Bay is now the seventh largest in the nation and Florida's largest tonnage port, handling nearly half of all seaborne commerce that passes through the state. Tampa ranks second in the state behind Miami in terms of cruise ship travel. Besides smaller regional cruise ships such as Yacht Starship and SunCruz Casino, Tampa also serves as a port of call for three cruise lines: Holland America's MS Ryndam, Royal Caribbean's Grandeur of the Seas and Radiance of the Seas, and Carnival's Inspiration and Legend.[132] MacDill Air Force Base remains a major employer as the parent installation for over 15,000 active uniformed military, Department of Defense (DoD) civil service and DoD contractor personnel in the Tampa Bay area. A significant majority of the civil service and contractor personnel are, in fact, themselves retired career military personnel. In addition to the 6th Air Mobility Wing, which is \"host wing\" for the base, MacDill is also home to Headquarters, United States Central Command (USCENTCOM), Headquarters, United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), the 927th Air Refueling Wing, Headquarters, United States Marine Forces Central Command (USMARCENT), Headquarters, United States Special Operations Command Central (USSOCCENT), and numerous other military activities of the active and reserve components of the armed forces. Tampa is home to a variety of stage and performing arts venues and theaters, including the David A. Straz Jr. Center for the Performing Arts, Tampa Theatre, Gorilla Theatre, and the MidFlorida Credit Union Amphitheatre next to the Florida State Fairgrounds. Performing arts companies and organizations which call Tampa home include the Florida Orchestra, Opera Tampa, Jobsite Theater, the Master Chorale of Tampa Bay, the Heralds of Harmony, Stageworks Theatre, Spanish Lyric Theater, Tampa Bay Opera, and the Tampa Bay Symphony.

The NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the NHL's Tampa Bay Lightning call Tampa home, while the Tampa Bay Rays of the MLB play across the bay in St. Petersburg (though they spent the 2025 season at George M. Steinbrenner Field following the damage to Tropicana Field by Hurricane Milton). As indicated by their names, these teams, plus several other sports teams, represent the entire Tampa metropolitan area. Tampa Bay's professional teams have won eight combined championships in their respective leagues. The Tampa Bay area has long been a site for Major League Baseball spring training facilities and minor league baseball teams. The New York Yankees conduct spring training in Tampa, and their Low-A affiliate Tampa Tarpons play there in the summer. On the collegiate level, the University of South Florida Bulls compete in 17 sports in NCAA Division I and the University of Tampa Spartans compete in 20 sports in NCAA Division II.[164][165] Between September 2020 and July 2021 all three of Tampa Bay's major teams, as well as the Tampa Bay Rowdies, qualified for their sport's championship series. The Lightning beat the Dallas Stars in the 2020 Stanley Cup Finals, the Rays lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 2020 World Series, the Rowdies and Phoenix Rising FC were named co-league champions after the USL Championship game was canceled due to COVID-19, the Buccaneers beat the Kansas City Chiefs in the first home-game victory in Super Bowl history, and the Lightning beat the Montreal Canadiens in the 2021 Stanley Cup Finals. This dynasty earned the area the nickname \"Champa Bay\".[166][167] The Tampa Bay Buccaneers began in 1976 as an expansion team of the NFL. They struggled at first, losing their first 26 games in a row to set a league record for futility. After a brief taste of success in the late 1970s, the Bucs again returned to their losing ways, and at one point lost at least 10 games for 12 seasons in a row.[168] The hiring of Tony Dungy in 1996 started an improving trend that eventually led to the team's victory in Super Bowl XXXVII in 2003 under coach Jon Gruden. They won their second championship in Super Bowl LV with quarterback Tom Brady and became the first NFL team to ever win a Super Bowl at their home stadium. Originally the Pittsburgh Gladiators and a charter member of the Arena Football League (AFL), the Tampa Bay Storm relocated from Pittsburgh in 1991 and won ArenaBowl V that year. They later won 4 more ArenaBowls (VII, IX, X, and XVII, and also appeared in ArenaBowl I, III, XII, XXIII and XXX), and their five championships were the most in league history.[169] The AFL suffered through several years of decreasing revenue in the 2010s, leading to fewer active franchises. There were only five teams during the 2017 season, after which the Storm's ownership group suspended operations.[170] Tampa was also home to the Tampa Bay Bandits of the United States Football League. The Bandits made the playoffs twice in their three seasons under head coach Steve Spurrier and drew league-leading crowds to Tampa Stadium, but the team folded along with the rest of the USFL after the 1985 season.[171][172] They played at Tampa Stadium, which hosted the 1984 USFL Championship Game.[173] The Tampa Bay Vipers play in the second edition of the XFL. Their inaugural season was cut short after five weeks due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The team relocated to Las Vegas, Nevada, and now are the Las Vegas Vipers. The Tampa Bay Tornadoes were founded in 2020 and describe themselves as the successors to the defunct Tampa Bay Storm. They play in the American Arena League. The Tampa Bay area has long been home to nationally competitive amateur baseball and has hosted spring training and minor league teams for over a century. Tampa became the first city in Florida to host a major league team for spring training in 1913, when the Chicago Cubs trained at Plant Field. The Tampa Smokers were the city's first minor league team, beginning play as charter members of the new Florida State League in 1919. After decades of trying to lure an existing Major League Baseball franchise, the Tampa Bay area finally gained a team in 1998, when the expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays began play at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg. After a decade of futility on the field, the Devil Rays shortened their nickname to simply Rays in 2008 and promptly won the 2008 American League Pennant, finishing runner up in World Series. They also won American League East titles in 2008 and 2010 under manager Joe Maddon before slipping back in the standings. In 2007, the Rays began the process of searching for a stadium site closer to the center of the area's population, possibly in Tampa.[174][175] However, over a decade later, rivalry between Tampa and St. Petersburg and the challenges of financing a new ballpark have kept the Rays playing at Tropicana Field.[176] In 2020, the Rays won the AL East for the first time in a decade with the best record in the American League.[177] Due to the COVID-19 shortened season, 16 teams made the playoffs, so the Rays had to play a best of 3 series against the division rival Toronto Blue Jays in the first round of the Rays postseason, where they swept the visitors in two games at Tropicana Field.[178] then play a divisional series against the New York Yankees, which they won in 5 games at a neutral site in San Diego.[179] The Rays then faced the Astros, who had defeated them in the divisional round the previous year. Tampa Bay went out to a quick 3–0 series lead, but Houston came back to tie the series 3–3. The Rays avoided the reverse sweep in Game 7 and won their second American League Pennant, then lost the World Series in 6 games to the Los Angeles Dodgers.[180] Several Major League baseball teams conduct Spring Training in the area, and most also operate minor league teams in the Low-A Southeast. The major league New York Yankees and the affiliated minor league Tampa Tarpons use George M. Steinbrenner Field across Dale Mabry Highway from Raymond James Stadium. Across the bay in Pinellas County, the Philadelphia Phillies affiliate Clearwater Threshers and Toronto Blue Jays affiliate Dunedin Blue Jays also play in the Low-A Southeast. Other nearby Low-A Southeast teams include the Pittsburgh Pirates affiliate Bradenton Marauders and the Detroit Tigers affiliate Lakeland Flying Tigers. The Phillies, Blue Jays, Pirates, and Tigers all play their Spring Training games at their minor league teams' ballparks. The Tarpons have won five league titles, the Flying Tigers have won four, the Threshers have won two, and the Blue Jays and Marauders have each won one. The area was formerly home to many teams in the former Florida State League that no longer exist, most notably the Tampa Smokers, St. Petersburg Saints, and the original Tampa Tarpons. The NHL's Tampa Bay Lightning, named after the city's propensity for attracting lightning unlike any other on the continent, was established in 1992, and play their home games at Amalie Arena in downtown Tampa. In 2004, the team won their first Stanley Cup by defeating the Calgary Flames in 7 games. After this first championship and an ensuing season-wide lockout, the Lightning went 1–3 in four Conference Final appearances in 2011, 2015, 2016 and 2018, winning only in 2015 to lose to the Chicago Blackhawks in the ensuing Finals. Then the Lightning won back-to-back Stanley Cups in 2020 and 2021 with victories over the Dallas Stars and fellow Atlantic Division member Montreal Canadiens respectively. Tampa hosted the skills contests and 2018 NHL All-Star Game weekend on January 27–28, 2018. Former captain Steve Stamkos is the franchise's top scorer with 555 goals across sixteen seasons before signing a new contract with the Nashville Predators after the 2023–24 NHL season. The Tampa Bay Rowdies compete in the United Soccer League Championship after spending their first 6 seasons in the North American Soccer League. The team began play at Tampa's George M. Steinbrenner Field in 2010, then moved to St. Petersburg's Al Lang Field in 2011. The Rowdies won their first league championship in Soccer Bowl 2012. The Rowdies made the USL Championship Final for the first time in 2020, though it was cancelled due to COVID-19. The Rowdies and the other finalist, Phoenix Rising FC, were named co-champions by the league.[181][182] Previously, Tampa had hosted two top-level soccer teams. The Tampa Bay Rowdies of the original North American Soccer League was the area's first major sports franchise, beginning play in 1975 at Tampa Stadium. The Rowdies were an immediate success, drawing good crowds and winning Soccer Bowl '75 in their first season to bring Tampa its first professional sports championship. Though the NASL ceased operations in 1984, the Rowdies continued to compete in various soccer leagues until finally folding in 1993. The success of the Rowdies prompted Major League Soccer (MLS) to award Tampa a charter member of the new league in 1996. The Tampa Bay Mutiny were the first MLS Supporters' Shield winner and had much early success beginning in 1996. However, the club folded in 2001 when local ownership could not be secured mainly due to a financially poor lease agreement for Raymond James Stadium. The city has no representation in MLS, however, the Rowdies are seeking to join the league.[183] Tampa Bay Sun FC were founded in 2023, becoming a founding member of the USL Super League, a top-division women's soccer league. They will play at Riverfront Stadium, a newly renovated stadium on the campus of Blake High School.[184][185] The Tampa Bay area does not have a professional basketball team. The Orlando Magic are the closest NBA team to the area, 85 miles east. The Tampa Bay area had several teams in minor basketball leagues. The Tampa Bay Titans played in The Basketball League (TBL) from 2019 to 2022. Their home games were played at Pasco–Hernando State College. The St. Pete Tide and the Tampa Gunners played in the Florida Basketball Association (FBA). The Tide's home games were played at St. Petersburg Catholic High School, and the Gunners were a travel team. Amalie Arena was used as the home of the NBA's Toronto Raptors for the 2020–2021 season because of Canadian government regulations due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada.[186] It was the first time an NBA team played home games in Tampa, though some exhibition preseason games had been played in Tampa between the Orlando Magic and Miami Heat prior to this. The University of South Florida is the only NCAA Division I sports program in Tampa. USF began playing intercollegiate sports in 1965. The Bulls established a men's basketball team in 1971 and a football team in 1997 and sponsor 17 teams in total. The Bulls joined the Big East in 2005, and the football team rose to as high as #2 in the BCS rankings in 2007. They are now part of the American Athletic Conference.

                "title": "Body of water or regional identity? | Tampa Bay History Center",
                "content": "You are using an outdated browser. Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience. Tampa or Tampa Bay. The actual name of a city or an invented regional moniker? That has been a common topic for letter writers to the Tampa Tribune for the past several weeks and for the past several years throughout Tampa – or the Tampa Bay area, if you prefer. Which should we use? Which one is correct? Where did the names come from? Let’s answer the last question first. One of the most common questions asked by visitors to the History Center is, “what does the word Tampa mean?” We always have to give the unsatisfying answer, “we do not really know.” Some will say that it means “sticks of fire,” and there is an impressive sculpture in Plant Park at the University of Tampa with that name, but there is absolutely no evidence to back up this claim. The name Tampa, or Tanpa, was first officially mentioned by Europeans in 1575 when Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda wrote Memoir of Don d’Escalante Fontaneda, respecting Florida. Fontaneda was the lone survivor of a shipwreck in the late 1540s at the age of 13. He spent the next seventeen years of his life among the Calusa Indians in Southwest Florida, learning about the principal American Indian towns along Florida’s west coast, including a town called ‘Tanpa.’ No one is sure if Tanpa is geographically the same as Tampa because early map makers moved the locations of present-day Tampa Bay (the body of water) and Charlotte Harbor, eliminated one or both, or added one or more extra bays and inlets along Florida’s gulf coast. Fontaneda never documented why the village was called Tanpa, and the people who lived there have been gone for almost half a millennia. Another wrinkle in the story is that the name given to the bay by early European explorers and map makers was not Tampa Bay, but rather La Bahia de Espirito Santo, or Bay of the Holy Spirit. The bay retained that name, with a few exceptions, for over two hundred years. English map makers, beginning in the 1760s when Great Britain acquired Florida from Spain, began to Anglicize Florida place names. Espirito Santo became Tampa Bay – a name that had appeared on maps as early as 1601 (as Bahia de Tampa/Tanpa) – and a new name appeared to designate the northeast arm of the bay. Hillsborough Bay, and the river that feeds it, were named in honor of Lord Hillsborough, who at the time was Secretary of State for the British Colonies. At some point in the 19th century, another bit of fine tuning occurred to the naming of the bays. Tampa Bay (or the Bay of Tampa, as it was still sometimes referred to) was essentially split in two. The northwestern arm became known as Old Tampa Bay, perhaps a reference to the supposed location of the village of Tampa/Tanpa, with the implication being that that bay was the “original” or old Bay of Tampa. The main bay kept the name Tampa Bay, and Hillsborough Bay remained the name of the northeastern arm. Another event in the 19th century brought the name Tampa Bay to the attention of Americans. The Second Seminole War (1835-1842) was among the most costly Indian Wars fought by the US military, and Fort Brooke “at Tampa Bay” served as the headquarters for the army fighting in Florida. The fort, established in 1824, was actually located in present-day downtown Tampa on the north end of Hillsborough Bay, but even by the 1820s, Tampa Bay was being used as an identifying name for the whole area. A small village took hold on the northern edge of Fort Brooke, and on November 24, 1831, the government established a post office, effectively giving the new town a name – Tampa Bay. Three years later the post office, and town, dropped the ‘Bay’ and became known as Tampa. That same year, 1834, Tampa was named the county seat of the newly created Hillsborough County. Despite “Tampa” becoming the official name of the town (and later city), the area retained the name Tampa Bay. Numerous letters and maps from the 1840s through the 1880s referred to Tampa Bay in a general catch-all sort of way, in both a military context with the Second Seminole War and the Civil War and as a potential tourist destination. The explosive growth of Tampa in the mid-1880s coincided with the diminished use of Tampa Bay as a regional identifier. The name Tampa began to supplant other area place names, and the city even annexed two smaller cities in the 20th century (West Tampa in 1925 and Port Tampa City in 1961). The whole region experienced incredible growth following World War II, with most of that growth occurring outside of the official boundaries of the City of Tampa. While the city annexed a large amount of unincorporated territory on the Interbay Peninsula in 1956, expansive growth in eastern and northern Hillsborough County and throughout Pinellas County meant that Tampa was no longer the only important place in the area. The region needed a new identity, and an old name returned. Tampa Bay was reborn. Though Tampa Bay as a descriptor of the whole area came back in vogue in the 1950s, it wasn’t until the arrival of professional sports franchises that the name really began to stick. Interestingly, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers were not the first professional sports franchise in the area. That distinction goes to the Tampa Bay Rowdies, who played their first soccer game at Tampa Stadium in 1975. The Bucs took the field the following year, and the name Tampa Bay spread throughout sports pages across the country. That, more than anything else, has engrained the name Tampa Bay into the national lexicon. An interesting side effect of this area identity is that many people outside of the region think that the Tampa Bay Rays play in Tampa. Efforts to make this misconception a reality notwithstanding, St. Petersburg leaders are understandably irritated by the mistaken identity and have gone to great lengths to establish the Rays as St. Petersburg’s team. So where do we go from here? If you were born in Tampa, be proud to say so. If you moved to Tampa from someplace else, tell people you live in Tampa. However, do not be so quick to correct someone who talks about Tampa Bay as anything other than a body of water. Lots of people from our past would know exactly what and where they are talking about.

                "content": "The Substance is a 2024 body horror film written, directed, co-edited, and co-produced by Coralie Fargeat. It follows a fading celebrity, Elisabeth Sparkle (Demi Moore) who, after being fired by her producer (Dennis Quaid) due to her age, uses a black market drug that creates a much younger version of herself (Margaret Qualley) with unexpected side effects. An international co-production between France, the United Kingdom, and the United States,[5] the film followed the critical success of Fargeat's first feature film, Revenge. Motivated by societal pressures on women's bodies and aging, she wrote the screenplay in two years with detailed descriptions and minimal dialogue. Moore was cast in the leading role after a series of interviews, Qualley was cast second, and Ray Liotta was originally cast in Quaid's role prior to his death. Filmed in France over 108 days, the film made extensive use of prosthetic makeup designed by Pierre-Olivier Persin, insert shots, a variety of sets, and approximately 21,000 liters of fake blood. The film score was written by Raffertie and also features \"Pump It Up!\" covered by DJ Endor. The prosthetic design included a series of grotesque and hyperrealistic suits, puppets, and dummies for Elisabeth's drug-induced transformation. The Substance had its world premiere on May 19, 2024 at the 77th Cannes Film Festival main competition, where Fargeat won Best Screenplay. It was released theatrically in the United Kingdom and the United States by Mubi on September 20, 2024, and in France by Metropolitan Filmexport on November 6, 2024. The film was a critical and commercial success, grossing over $78 million on a $17.5 million production budget. It received five nominations at the 82nd Golden Globe Awards, including Best Motion Picture – Comedy or Musical, going on to win Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy for Moore. On her fiftieth birthday, Elisabeth Sparkle, a once-celebrated but now-faded Hollywood film star, is abruptly dismissed from her long-running aerobics TV show by the producer, Harvey, due to her age. A distraught Elisabeth crashes her car while distracted by a billboard of herself being taken down. At the hospital, a young nurse covertly gives her a flash drive advertising \"The Substance\", a black market serum that promises a \"younger, more beautiful, more perfect\" version of oneself. Elisabeth, intrigued and desperate, orders The Substance and injects the single-use activator serum. She convulses as her body generates a younger version of herself, Sue, who emerges from a slit in her back. The two bodies must switch consciousness every seven days without exception, with the inactive body remaining unconscious and fed intravenously with a weekly food supply. Daily injections of stabilizer fluid, extracted from the original body, are necessary to prevent Sue from deteriorating. Sue quickly becomes an overnight sensation after auditioning to be Elisabeth's replacement on the TV show and is eventually offered the chance by Harvey to host the network's prestigious New Year's Eve Show. While Sue lives a confident and hedonistic life, Elisabeth becomes a self-hating recluse. Nearing the end of one allotted weekly cycle, Sue parties and brings a man home for casual sex, delaying the switch by extracting additional stabilizer fluid, causing Elisabeth's right index finger to suddenly age. Elisabeth contacts the supplier, who warns her that disobeying the switching program leads to irreversible, rapid aging of the original body. Despite their shared consciousness, Elisabeth and Sue begin to view themselves as separate individuals and grow to despise each other; Elisabeth resents Sue for her frequent disregard of the switching schedule, which further exacerbates her aging, while Sue is appalled by Elisabeth's constant self-loathing and binge-eating. Following a particularly destructive episode as Elisabeth, Sue stockpiles stabilizer fluid and refuses to switch back. Three months later, the day before the New Year's Eve telecast, Sue runs out of stabilizer fluid and contacts the supplier, who informs her that she must switch back to replenish the fluid. When they switch, Elisabeth finds herself horrifically transformed into an elderly hunchback. Desperate to stop Sue from aging her further, Elisabeth orders a serum designed to terminate her. But still craving the admiration that Sue's celebrity status provides, she stops before fully injecting the serum and resuscitates Sue, leaving both of them conscious. Realizing Elisabeth's intent, Sue attacks and kills her before leaving to host the New Year's special. Without Elisabeth, Sue's body begins to rapidly deteriorate. In a panic, she attempts to create a new version of herself using the leftover activator serum, despite the single-use warning. This results in the creation of a grotesque mutated body, \"Monstro Elisasue\", with both Sue and Elisabeth's faces. Wearing a mask cut from a poster of Elisabeth, Elisasue returns to the studio and attempts to host the show but the audience erupts into chaos. An audience member decapitates her, only for an even more mutated head to grow back, and one of her arms to snap off and drench both the audience and studio in torrents of blood. Elisasue flees the studio, but collapses and explodes into viscera. Elisabeth's original face detaches from the gore, crawling onto her neglected star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She smiles as she hallucinates being admired before melting into a puddle of blood, which is cleaned up by a floor scrubber the next day. Coralie Fargeat was director and producer alongside Working Title Films co-producers Eric Fellner and Tim Bevan,[6][7][8] and Blacksmith, a Paris-based production company[9] created by Fargeat that same year.[10][11] The Substance began filming on May 9, 2022,[12] and wrapped in October 2022, spanning 108 shooting days.[note 1] After the critical success of Revenge in the United States, Fargeat received offers to direct studio films, including Black Widow. However, the prospect of a studio film did not appeal to her, as she would not receive final cut privilege. Fargeat spent several months in Los Angeles following the release of Revenge, and began writing the first scenes of The Substance at a coffee shop in Silver Lake[16] as a spec script; she became a producer to maintain creative control.[17] Eric Fellner, who also co-produced the film, traveled to Paris several times for lunch with Fargeat after seeing Revenge in 2017, to persuade her to choose Working Title for her next project.[18] The screenplay was developed over two years, loosely inspired by her 2014 short Reality+,[19] with the entire production taking five years from concept to release.[20] Written in both English and French, the script featured descriptions in French,[21] though the film was written with English-speaking audiences in mind to ensure a wider appeal.\"[14] Fargeat aimed to continue the feminist themes developed in Revenge including what it means to be a woman.[22][23] She began writing the film in her 40s, a period when she was confronting negative thoughts about her relevance and appearance. \"I really started to think and [have] these voices in my head like, 'Now your life is over. No one is going to care about you.'\"[24] She described the process of making the film as a way to confront and release this internalized violence[note 2] tied to societal expectations about women's bodies and aging, using the body horror genre as a \"weapon of expression.\"[28][29][21][30] People often ask if my characters are caricatures, and my first instinct is to say 'yes.' Then I think, 'no, no, they're not caricatures.' Unfortunately, they are behaviors that have existed and continue to exist. Here, they're just brought to the forefront and presented openly. In real life, it's not always as obvious—although sometimes it is.[31] Fargeat crafted the 146-page script[32][33] with a scant 29 pages dedicated to dialogue.[34][note 3] She has described her writing style as like writing a novel.[36][note 4] She wrote the script in extensive detail;[37][28] every sensory experience the audience would feel in the final film including sounds (with onomatopoeia like \"SPLOSH\" and \"AAAGH\")[38] and sometimes even specified close-ups were written in the script.[36] Similarly, she chose to omit character backstories, preferring to reveal information through actions, locations, and attire. For example, colors were written into the script to symbolize character traits — Elisabeth Sparkle's yellow jacket representing a \"superhero-like\" quality before her transformation, and Sue's pink leotard signifying her femininity.[28] The character Sue, described as blonde in a 2020 draft of the script,[39] was given her namesake to subconsciously evoke Lolita and Marilyn Monroe, \"baby-doll\"-like iconography, and classic beauty standards that continue to endure.[28] Fargeat chose the name Elisabeth for its \"iconic resonance\" with stars of Old Hollywood, and Sparkle because of its associations with happiness and to \"shine and be under the light.\"[40] The film's pivotal birth scene, which Fargeat conceived while in the shower,[41] was the first that Fargeat wrote,[42] and in her view, \"the most important scene of the film.\" She recalls, \"I didn't even know who my character would be. It's the first one that really came to my mind, and it holds the core DNA of the movie as a true visceral experience with no words, making you feel what the characters are going to feel.\"[37] Fargeat later decided that the main character should be an actress to explore societal perceptions of bodies.[43] She chose to have Elisabeth Sparkle host an aerobics class,[44] inspired by Jane Fonda's transition from a successful actress to her second career starring in exercise tapes.[45] Fargeat listened to a variety of music to influence the screenplay. She cited Mica Levi's score for Under the Skin (2013), and other experimental music and composers that had \"this kind of heartbeat or pulsation...related to the heartbeat of the new human being or the way you can feel with your body.\"[46] Fargeat also listened to hypersexualized music, which helped inspire the in-universe Pump It Up show.[46] Fargeat knew that casting would be challenging, as the film had minimal dialogue and relies heavily on the characters. Elisabeth Sparkle needed to be cast first, as she is the one who generates her other self.[41] Fargeat wanted to cast an actress who had been at the heart of the star system,[47] a real-life icon.[41][48] Demi Moore was not Fargeat's first choice;[17] several actresses were considered but declined the role before Moore.[49] When Moore's name was brought up, Fargeat thought she would be a good fit but believed that she would \"never do the film\" and be willing to \"destroy her image.\"[50] With nothing to lose, Moore was sent the script.[51] At her agent's insistence, Moore read the script before knowing specific details, later speculating that this was due to the film's sensitive subject of aging.[52][53] She was impressed by the script and its subject matter,[52][54][53] though she was unfamiliar with the body horror genre.[17] Moore felt that the film could either \"really work and be part of a cultural shift\" or \"be a fucking disaster.\"[17] She remained unsure of the audience reaction up until the premiere when she knew the film had worked.[55] Surprised by Moore's positive response,[47] Fargeat read her autobiography and was struck by her resilience.[56][47] \"I read her autobiography, and she had some tough years in her personal life. [...] She made herself on her own [...] in a place that was a totally male-dominated industry, being ahead of her time in many regards, like doing this naked picture of her pregnant, taking a lot of risks and having a lot of feminist statements, wanting to be paid as much as her co-stars.\"[21] Fargeat had previously worked as a trainee assistant director[note 5] on the 2000 Moore-led film, Passion of Mind, handling tasks like making copies and bringing her coffee in the mornings.[21] Before being offered the role, Moore discussed the film with Fargeat over six meetings.[57][58][59] Fargeat explained the film in detail:[60] the film's extensive prep work, prosthetics, meager resources, shooting location and the level of nudity, which she felt was foundational to the story.[49] Moore understood the meta-nature[15] of the role but did not feel that she was the character, as Elisabeth had no family. As she further explained, \"she's dedicated her entire life to her career, and when that's taken, what does she have?\" However, Moore sympathized with the character's pain.[61] She recognized that the characters were deeply important to Fargeat, and saw them as stand-ins for the director herself: Elisabeth represents Fargeat, while Qualley's Sue is the girl from the '90s that Fargeat always felt pitted against.[62] Moore would later reflect positively on her role saying, \"What I love is this was a rich, complex, demanding role that gave me an opportunity to really push myself outside of my comfort zone, and in the end to feel like I explored and grew not only as an actor, but as a person.\"[63] While talking to Moore, Fargeat thought about potential pairings; later, when she met with Margaret Qualley, she felt they had a common energy. Fargeat also liked that Qualley had a background as a dancer.[41] Moore had prior indirect ties with Qualley and worked with Qualley's mother, Andie MacDowell, in St. Elmo's Fire, and Qualley knew Moore's daughters.[64] Qualley was in Panama, shooting Claire Denis's Stars at Noon, when she read the script and was drawn to the prospect of playing a character who seemed \"really far from [her]\" and she had a feeling that it was going to be \"special.\"[52] During prep, Fargeat emphasized the physicality of the roles (both actors' bodies would be central to their performances). For Qualley, this meant lifting weights for months to achieve Sue's sex symbol figure.[15][56] Qualley spent a lot of time walking around her apartment practicing her character, \"freaking my husband out\" (referring to her husband, Jack Antonoff).[65] On set, Fargeat read the dialogue for the Substance Voice to provide a temporary track. After a lengthy casting process, she chose American actor Yann Bean, who was living in Paris, to voice it. Fargeat wanted a voice with devil-like, tempting, and powerful qualities.[66] Principal photography took place entirely in France, with an all-French film crew except for cinematographer Benjamin Kračun and composer Raffertie (both from the United Kingdom).[13] Studio scenes were filmed at Epinay Studios in Seine-Saint-Denis, Île-de-France near Paris—the historic studio where Jean Cocteau shot Beauty and the Beast (1946). Exterior scenes doubling for Los Angeles were filmed on the Côte d'Azur,[13] including locations in Antibes such as the Anthéa Theatre, which doubled for a hospital, and the Marineland parking lot.[67] Palm trees were filmed in Cannes[68] with additional scenes shot in Nice,[69] Carros and Saint-Laurent-du-Var.[67] France was selected to accommodate the film's extensive shooting schedule due to practical effects work, with the country's 40% Tax Rebate for International Productions (TRIP) also providing an incentive.[13] Fargeat selected Kračun as cinematographer after being impressed by his work on Promising Young Woman.[70] He shot the film primarily with the Alexa LF, for its accurate capture of skin tones,[35] and used vintage, spherical Canon K35 lenses to accommodate the large number of close-ups in the film.[71] Other lenses included Angénieux Optimo zooms, Leitz Thalia, macros from Cooke Optics and Arri and a Leitz M 0.8 for the body-camera work.[35] Red V-Raptor and Komodo were also used: the Raptor for visual effects, with its high resolution 8K sensor, and the Komodo for the body, requiring a helmet rig.[35] The film was shot in continuity when possible, adopting what the crew called a \"lab shoot\" approach in its final month. The \"lab shoot\" was used to capture insert shots,[72] typically assigned to a second unit[73] with a reduced crew.[37] The most time-consuming prosthetics shots were also filmed during this time period,[74] including close-ups of injections and a back splitting open.[75] Fargeat storyboarded all the prosthetics and birth sections before production began, focusing on the birth scene first during pre-production.[76] This helped estimate financial costs for the prosthetic dummies, how many to build, and the extent of their body details.[77] The birth sequence took 15 days to film.[78] Fargeat even went so far as to perform an actual syringe injection of the activator on her own arm, doubling for Demi Moore in the shot.[75] Crew sizes fluctuated significantly throughout production, ranging from just 6 members for the lab shoot,[75] 8 for exterior scenes, and over 200 for complex practical effects sequences in the studio.[13] Kračun initially considered using a safety wire to drop a camera past a series of lights for the infinity tunnel sequence.[35] Ultimately, he devised a simpler solution: two horizontal bicycle tires surrounded by LED tube lights, spinning together at the same speed around a stationary camera to create an infinity tunnel effect.[35][75] He decided to film the fire in the shape of a dragon on the studio floor practically, capturing it from above. The footage was then blended into the scene where Sue is seen by the window.[79] Ray Liotta was originally cast as Harvey,[80] but died in May 2022. Three months into filming, Liotta was replaced by Dennis Quaid.[81] Quaid's arrival brought an \"energy injection\" to the set. For his lunch scene with Demi Moore, Quaid consumed approximately 2 kilograms of shrimp.[note 6] Margaret Qualley lightheartedly described learning the choreography for The Substance as a \"nightmare\" and was overwhelmed by performing with professional dancers who had already memorized the moves which she was new to. Although trained as a ballet dancer,[84] she explained that \"that specific kind of sexuality doesn't lend itself to [me]\"[85] and that she'd \"never [do it] again.\"[86] Qualley began the rehearsal with Fargeat present but left the set to go to the bathroom and cry. Fargeat decided to leave the rehearsal as well; Qualley instead chose to learn the moves in a private lesson, allowing her to practice in her hotel room and build confidence as she felt deeply ashamed by the whole series of events.[85] Nonetheless, on the day of the shoot, her anxiety led her to get \"wasted first thing in the morning\" by smoking cannabis and drinking tequila.[85] In a live Q&A after the film's release, Qualley expressed happiness in getting to perform the dance, as many previous scenes had been slow-paced and required minimal movement or expression, making the dance sequence a welcome change.[87] Moore found Fargeat to be a \"very visual director\" with a focus on symbolism.[88] While Moore was accustomed to starting scenes with wide shots to establish the scene's space, Fargeat instead began with close-ups. Moore found that \"the actor's part of it is not as...important\" to Fargeat: \"it's not necessarily where she's as focused.\" Moore described this as \"not good or bad, just kind of different.\"[89] Fargeat praised Moore's body language in the film;[56] Moore chose to express Elisabeth through subtleties, such as her eyes and other simple expressions.[90] She also worked with a movement coach over Zoom for her character's later scenes, where she is forced to move quickly while hunched over due to physical disfigurement.[91] During a one-week break while only Qualley was working, Moore contracted shingles and lost 20 pounds during the production.[15] Initially, two days of exterior shooting were planned in Los Angeles. However, after Kračun filmed test shots of palm trees early on during filming, Fargeat realized she could use these shots as tableaux, and eliminate extensive exterior shots. Ultimately, the only part of the film actually shot in Los Angeles was the still backdrop (photographed by Rosco Digital) in the Canyons.[92] The special effects team utilized around 21,000 litres[note 7] of fake blood and a fire hose.[98] The shots of the audience being sprayed with blood in the climax were achieved in one take.[97] Kračun was surprised by the amount of blood remarking, \"Coralie said at one point, 'I want to have fire engines full of blood spraying the audience,' and I thought, 'Oh, maybe that's just a French way of saying there's going to be a lot of blood,' but no, she really wanted a hose full of blood in the audience, in the theater, and it was going to be a lot of blood!\"[35] Filming of the theater scenes took nearly three weeks; it became a significant technical challenge of how to control the spread, pressure, and quantity of blood, how to waterproof the filming equipment,[95][35] and how to keep everyone safe. Showers were set up outside the theater set for the extras.[101] During the shoot, Kračun hid himself in the audience and filmed while Fargeat operated another camera and controlled the hose. Once Fargeat and Kračun were on set covered in blood, they hugged each other and said, \"We did it.\"[79] That's the most important thing for me [...] why the images came the way they came, even if they don't make sense from a realistic point of view. [...] We don't care that it's not possible, because this is not reality. It's The Substance's reality.[102] The Substance required a three-month construction period to build the sets, including Elisabeth's apartment with distinct spaces like the bathroom and secret room as well as the New Year's Eve theater and a TV studio hallway.[35] The central feature of the apartment set was the large panoramic window, symbolizing Elisabeth's past and, later, Sue's rebirth and future. Fargeat envisioned the apartment with a \"timeless, old-fashioned but also futuristic quality\", allowing it to transcend specific eras and enrich the story with symbolism.[28] Initially, Fargeat and Kračun considered LED-screen technology from Darkmatters[103] for the window's scenic Los Angeles cityscape, but Kračun determined it was costly and technically challenging, involving nine technicians to operate. He also felt that LEDs could not achieve Fargeat’s vision of hard sunlight for Los Angeles.[104] Instead, they opted for a Rosco SoftDrop backdrop, evoking a romantic, Hitchcockian quality;[105] Kračun described the overall look of the film as \"pink noir.\"[106] Fargeat expressed great satisfaction seeing the practical set for the first time as she had anticipated shooting it on greenscreen.[79] Fargeat wanted the bathroom set to function as a metaphorical \"cocoon\" and envisioned it as a mental space that felt abstract, stylized, and empty. She pushed back against the production designer who wanted a more realistic look and who asked: \"Are you sure you don't want any furniture in the bathroom at all?\"[28] Kračun wanted sconces to help modify the lighting but Fargeat ultimately rejected this idea, and the lighting was kept harsh.[107] During the birth scene's point-of-view shot, two identical bathroom sets were built to simulate a mirror: Qualley acted in one, while Kračun (wearing a head-mounted camera) and a body double mimicked her movements in the other.[35][75] The hand movements on the mirror were later reshot in post-production in front of a green screen due to difficulties syncing the movements.[108] For some shots, an actual mirror was placed between the two bathrooms to capture Qualley's reflection.[109] The scene with Moore lying on the floor and striking her head, while the camera booms up, was shot fully in camera and achieved by constructing a shower three times taller than standard height.[110] After the production finished shooting on the apartment set, it was destroyed to build the theater in the same space, being \"basically [...] built on the ashes of the apartment\" according to Fargeat.[79] Initially, there were plans to shoot in a real theater that was going to be refurbished completely,[111] but the crew discovered that the venue, while initially welcoming at the idea of shooting a small splattering of blood, became apprehensive upon realizing the extent of the blood effects. As one producer remarked, \"Okay, I don't want to finish in jail. We can't shoot in a real theater, because there is no way we can protect it in a way that it's not going to be destroyed.\"[79] Fargeat described post-production as the most challenging aspect of the film.[112] The editing took a year and a half.[113][19] One of the main challenges was finding the right pacing for the scenes due to a lack of dialogue.[114] Scenes were frequently changed based on the interaction of the music, visual effects and sound design,[115] with post-production finishing just three days before the premiere.[19] Visual effects by NOID Studio took one year to complete.[116] For the sound design, Fargeat placed sound effects and notes in the editing software timeline for sound designers and editors Valérie Deloof and Victor Fleurant.[117] The team was tasked with finding the right textures, effects, and tone for each scene, using exaggerated or realistic sounds to explore deeper meanings.[117] For example, a chainsaw was used for the electric mixer in Elisabeth Sparkle's cooking scene, and pistol handling sounds were used for the triggering of the capsule during injection shots.[117] For the first person view shots in the birth sequence, Fargeat wanted Sue's movements to sound as if immersed in amniotic fluid. To achieve this, the sound team placed microphone capsules in the actors' ears to capture breathing through cranial resonance.[118][117] Simultaneously, a boom mic and a high-frequency mic captured audio to allow for further edits or to switch to an external viewpoint.[117] For scenes with Harvey, the team wanted to emphasize his larger-than-life character.[117] Before entering a scene like the bathroom or restaurant, sounds were mixed realistically.[117] Once on screen, they became heightened; for example, for the restaurant, sounds were layered emphasizing his eating and the juiciness of the shrimp.[117] Ambient sounds and music in the restaurant were also muted at this point.[117] When Harvey enters his office, the sound team emphasized the “blinged-out heaviness” of his boots.[117] The team created soundscapes to enhance the film's visuals and themes.[117] When Elisabeth leaves to retrieve the substance, the sound design shifts from a noisy street to deserted suburbs with dogs, police sirens, and crows used to foreshadow danger.[117] Inside the storage facility, sounds were shaped musically with metallic materials and sustained notes to give a feeling of discomfort, and then drawn back to only a low and clinical neon light.[117] For the low-angle shot of \"Gollum\" banging on the bathroom door, VFX were used to combine Moore's prosthetics with the prosthetics on the thinner body double.[119] When projected for Kračun, the film appeared too sharp, so it was downscaled to 2K and then upscaled to 4K to retain the softness he found on the set. When Sue is on the TV show, the footage was kept at the original pre-processed 4K for a sharper look.[35] The film score was conceived by British producer and composer Raffertie.[120] It was recorded within a span of two months as Raffertie was involved late into the post-production and that he was tasked to complete the score in time for the film's May premiere.[121][113] As per Fargeat's interest, Raffertie produced an electronic score that focused on the duality between Elisabeth and Sue, ranging from organic and nostalgic,[122] to synthetic and contemporary.[122] The soundtrack was released through Waxwork Records digitally on September 13, 2024,[123] and in vinyl LP on September 27.[124] Fargeat used extensive practical effects, prosthetics and makeup, accounting for 70–80% of the final film,[125] resisting the push toward cheaper digital effects.[13] She felt that the use of practical effects was crucial to convey the themes of violence.[126] The effects were created by Pierre-Olivier Persin and his company, Pop FX, based in Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis.[127] Leading a team of 15,[128] Persin oversaw the work both at Pop FX's studio and at a second rented workshop.[127] Persin dedicated 11 months to the project, spanning pre-production and shooting.[38] He was hired at the recommendation of executive producer Nicolas Royer[128][13] (who appears in the film as \"guy in the elevator\" and previously worked with Persin). Initially, Fargeat had chosen another company to create the designs but was disappointed with their work.[38] Persin later described their designs as good from an artistic perspective, but overly masculine[129]—\"a rubber monster for the guys.\"[127] Meanwhile, Fargeat had always envisioned the film ending with a monster that she referred to as a \"Picasso of male expectations.\"[97] Persin read the script, made a bid, and, while working on another project, sculpted a small plasticine[74] maquette of his design for the creature at the climax, \"Monstro Elisasue\"[note 8] over a few nights.[38] In the script, Monstro Elisasue was loosely outlined, only described as having Elisabeth's face located on its back.[128] Persin aimed to give Monstro some \"humility\" \"gracefulness\"[127] and resemble Sue.[130] Fargeat was impressed with his choices, such as the tilted head, backward-facing arm, and the inclusion of breasts, and offered him the position.[38] Fargeat and Persin later spent a month refining Monstro's design.[38][131] Persin would later remark in an interview: \"Coralie wanted her as if the body was put in a shaker.\"[130] Persin and Fargeat conducted a technical read-through over several days, outlining the requirements of each sequence. Persin visualized Fargeat's ideas for each transformation, through photoshop, digital sculpture, and regular sculpture.[127] He created designs based on digital scans of the actors, which Fargeat could select, combine, or modify. From there, he created actual prosthestic devices for screen tests.[127] Elisabeth's transformation process was organized into a series of five stages, following the birth of Sue: a withered finger (\"The Finger\"),[127] a more aged look called \"Requiem\" (inspired by Requiem for a Dream), a hunched-backed design referred to as \"Gollum\", \"Monstro Elisasue\", and \"The Blob.\"[131][130] Fargeat deliberately sought to avoid making the effects look realistic, aiming instead to create a deformed representation of the aging process, shaped by the characters' fear and anger.[132] Fargeat's vision for how quickly Elisabeth's transformations should occur sparked debate with Persin and the lead makeup artist, Stéphanie Guillon. For the pre-substance scenes, Guillon felt that \"[Moore's Elisabeth] had to be beautiful in the beginning… before she has all the prosthetics\", while Fargeat wanted her to appear flawed from the start. Similarly, Persin felt that pacing the changes more gradually would enhance their impact, explaining, \"It'll be wild and insane eventually.\"[127] Prosthetics application ranged between 45 minutes[131] to 7 hours[129][note 9] depending on character complexity, sometimes only leaving an hour or two for filming in a given day.[134][17][135] Early in production, without life casts or scans from the actresses,[38] Persin created and filmed a 30 cm[136] maquette of the back opening to send to Fargeat for her approval.[38] This enabled him to begin work on the scene.[137] Persin initially believed the prosthetic designs in the bathroom would be visually enhanced by moody lighting, akin to The Howling[74] or Dario Argento's films.[128] However, he would learn this was not the case, as he explained: \"At first, I asked Coralie, I said, in the bathroom, because lots of things happen in the bathroom, are we going to have a nice something a bit dark and with shadows and to hide a little bit of the silicone and all that. And she was like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Cut to the [bright] white tiles.\"[137] For the birthing scene, Persin used a combination of prosthetics on body doubles[130] and puppetry,[17] which relied on two faceless,[138] hyper-realistic silicone dummies that took between 1 and 1.5 months to construct.[139] The entire sequence was shot with practical effects, with the exception of the close up of the eye splitting.[75] Shots of the back splitting were achieved with the dummies on a raised set, operated by 5-6 puppeteers below while Fargeat directed from under the set or nearby.[38] For the stitching of the back, Persin alternated between a dummy and a prosthetic applied directly to the actresses' skin.[140] Careful attention was paid to the realism of the skin: the pores and cellulite were meticulously crafted, while layers of various colors: reds, yellows, greens, blues, and ochres — were applied in a pointillist method, as no single paint color can replicate a natural skin tone, according to Persin.[141] One challenge was avoiding giving the skin a \"too rubbery or too elastic\" appearance, so the team designed a prosthetic with soft material, but stiffer wound edges to make the needle weaving through the skin appear more realistic.[140] The spine scar and other prosthetics were applied to Moore, two stunt doubles and two body doubles.\"[140] For her nude scenes, Margaret Qualley was fitted with custom-made breast prostheses to portray an idealized image of beauty, reminiscent of Jessica Rabbit. Qualley humorously explained the process: \"Unfortunately, there is no magic boob potion, so we had to glue those on... [they endowed] me with the rack of a lifetime—just not my lifetime.\"[85] Persin's first project began with the finger prosthetic. However, the first test looked extremely fake, reminiscent of \"Mickey Mouse\".[140] Correcting it took a month[140] and temporarily halted the development of other prosthetics until the finger met Persin's desired standard of a balanced appearance, ensuring it would not look bulkier than the natural ones.[131] Achieving this required creating extremely thin prosthetics, and in total, all the prosthetics were redesigned twice.[131] Fargeat described the dialogue-free scene where Moore removes her makeup in front of a mirror as \"the most challenging\" of the film.[142] Fargeat was stressed on the day of the shoot because she knew she was creating the \"emotional heart of the movie\" where performance, rhythm and lighting had to be perfect.[142] Fargeat felt if Moore and the crew could pull it off, it would be incredibly powerful.[142] After the 11th take, Guillon intervened to stop filming for the day. \"I took the remover pad and I squashed everything, and I said, 'I removed everything, that's over. You have already 11. You cannot have more because tomorrow she will have a red face.' Normally you don't do that! But it was too much because it was very hard on her skin.\"[127] Persin praised Moore's professionalism during the five- to six-hour prosthetic application for the \"Requiem\" stage, likening it to \"going to the dentist for six hours.\"[127] The crew were especially impressed when Moore decided to postpone filming one of her scenes until the next day after noticing that her prosthetics had deteriorated over several hours of earlier shots, as she felt it would be extremely disrespectful to their hard work.[127] Due to Moore being partially blind in one eye, she requested the makeup team avoid working too closely around the eye.[128] Persin assumed the makeup effects would be further altered digitally but later discovered this was not the case.[128] Most of the Requiem sequence relied on applied prosthetics adhered directly to the skin, while a few shots, such as Elisabeth's leg in the shower, were fake body parts.[38] For the scene with Elisabeth’s stuck kneecap, a modified chair was used to conceal Moore's real legs while revealing prosthetic, mechanical ones crafted from silicone.[143] To achieve the look of translucent skin, the team used thin, prosthetic appliances that allowed the veins and bones to show through.[38] Moore's transformation into \"Gollum\" was more extensive, with layers of silicone prosthetics glued directly onto her body. Red and blue wool was embedded in the silicone to mimic the appearance of veins beneath the skin.[38][137] Persin used silicone because it looked more natural and did not easily wrinkle during the filming of action scenes.[137] When Elisabeth runs down the hallway, Moore was switched out for a thinner body double to match the idea of Gollum having a \"spider-like\" physicality.[38][137] A sophisticated fake head, capable of realistic bleeding, was created for the mirror-smashing scene.[140] Qualley smashed the fake head against the mirror and Moore mimed the action later with her real head; the visual effects team seamlessly blended the two shots to depict the head-on-mirror impact and Moore's reaction.[140] The head is a little bit like a female Elephant Man [...] that was what Coralie wanted, the sensibility of The Elephant Man, the David Lynch movie. We spent lots of time designing Monstro with all the breasts and trying to balance everything. Is she fat enough? How many boobs? Maybe we should add a jaw here. Maybe we can [add a spine], because there's lots of spines in the story from the very beginning.[131] Despite disagreements over previous transformations, for \"Monstro\", Persin and Fargeat were in sync.[140] Since there were time constraints (as the design for Monstro had not been finalized until after shooting began[144]), Persin subcontracted the Monstro build to Dave and Lou Elsey of UK-based Igor Studios.[38][137][145] The final design was created using five prosthetic heads (including a special head with a cavity that splits open to birth a breast attached to an umbilical cord), two full bodysuits, two partial bodysuits, and a mold of Moore's head.[97] The suit was entirely practical, with the exception of Moore's screaming face, which was achieved using digital effects,[98] using a photogrammetry scan of Moore's face[128] by Clear Angle Studios.[146] Persin drew inspiration from Niki de Saint Phalle, a French sculptor known for her vibrant and curvaceous figures, especially her depictions of female dancers.[127] Artist Fernando Botero, whose sculptures often feature women with exaggerated proportions, also served as an artistic reference.[97] Persin was also influenced by David Cronenberg's The Fly.[130] During pre-production, Persin expressed concern about the plan to have Qualley wear the full suit, noting that only Qualley's eye would be visible.[131] Fargeat ultimately had Qualley do close-up shots for Monstro, recognizing the importance of her performance. Persin later acknowledged that this decision was essential to making Monstro's scenes visibly impactful in the final film.[127] Qualley would later describe wearing the prosthetics as \"torture\", adding, \"I had this awesome team of prosthetic artists that put it on me and took it off of me and got me through the day, making me laugh a couple of times while I was just on the brink of panic.\"[99] \"My problem was I had to cry while I had the monster costume on. At a certain point, you're just swimming—there's like a layer of tears and snot inside your prosthetics, and they're just trying to reglue it down.\"[147] The prosthetics application for Qualley required six hours[97] and was filmed over the course of eight days.[15] To prevent overheating, the suit also incorporated a cooling vest similar to that which racecar drivers use.[125] Fargeat personally donned the Monstro suit for the shots showing blood spraying from Monstro's point of view. She held the camera herself, without the headpiece, while wearing the suit, as her arm was inside the blood rig.[131] Persin also put on the suit to operate a breast puppet, which required at least 10-15 takes and left his arm numb from holding it above his head for extended periods.[38] The constant spraying of blood caused the latex to turn pink as it became saturated quickly. The suit required repainting, resewing, and drying after each day. For safety purposes, the crew sprayed vodka inside the suit every night to kill bacteria and remove moisture.[130] Near the end of the film, the stunt performer had to be moved on a dolly, due to limited mobility of the suit. When the blood rig was first tested, the performer slipped and went rolling backward down the long blood-soaked hallway featured near the end of the film.[98] Ending the film with \"The Blob\" featuring Moore's face, Fargeat wanted to preserve her facial expressions. Persin and his team constructed and manually maneuevered a puppet blob for the scene, which was overlayed on Moore's face with visual effects.[131] It was also referred to as \"Gremlin\"[127] in the shooting schedule, a nod to Stripe melting at the end of Gremlins.[74] The Substance was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival, where it had its world premiere on May 19, 2024.[148][149] The film received a standing ovation.[150][151][152] Working Title's parent company, Universal Pictures, which originally signed on as the distributor through a deal with Working Title Films,[6] stepped away from the project but remained credited as a copyright holder in the film's credits. Multiple sources told The Hollywood Reporter that the studio was \"worried about the prospect of releasing the film.\"[17][153] According to Fargeat, the film encountered significant challenges during post-production, including a contentious test screening attended by two unnamed male executives and one unnamed female representative from Universal. One male executive vehemently opposed the film and insisted on a recut, a demand deemed unfeasible due to Fargeat's contractual final cut privilege. This led to Universal breaking off their distribution deal with Fargeat. Although the female representative later expressed her support for the film privately to Fargeat, she felt unable to voice her opinion during the screening.[19] Prior to its Cannes debut, Mubi acquired worldwide rights to the film for $12.5 million,[2] planning to distribute it theatrically in North America, United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Austria, Latin America, Benelux as well as holding rights for Turkey and India, with its sales company subsidiary The Match Factory handling worldwide sales.[154] The Substance opened in theaters in the US, UK, Latin America, Germany, Canada and Netherlands on September 20, 2024,[155] as well as in Spain on October 11, 2024.[156] Metropolitan Filmexport acquired French distribution rights from The Match Factory,[157][158] and released the film on November 6, 2024.[159] Advertising and film distribution costs for The Substance were under $20M worldwide and in the single digits in the United States.[160] The marketing used avant-garde imagery such as a chicken bone and shiny hot pink exercise leotard and was overseen by Fargeat. The only vestige of Moore was a one sheet showing her stitched up back. Despite this unconventional approach, the film spread on social media. Demi Moore's posts reached her 15M followers and contributed to a total online reach of 45M across platforms, as estimated by RelishMix (including 7.6M views on TikTok, 10.8M on Instagram, and millions of views for other fan made content).[160] The Substance was released on MUBI's streaming platform and VOD in selected markets on October 31, 2024.[161][162] The film is due to be released on DVD and Blu-ray on July 1, 2025 in the United Kingdom,[163] and on 4K, DVD and Blu-ray on January 21, 2025 in the United States.[164][165] Waxwork Records released the original score in \"Activator Fluorescent Green\" Colored Vinyl.[166][120] The Substance has grossed $16.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $61.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $78 million.[167][168] In the United States and Canada, The Substance was released alongside Transformers One and Never Let Go, and was projected to gross around $3 million from 1,949 theaters in its opening weekend.[169] The film made $1.3 million on its first day, including $512,000 from Wednesday and Thursday night previews.[2] It went on to debut to $3.2 million, finishing sixth at the box office.[170][171] The film dropped only 39% the following weekend, grossing $1.8 million.[172] The film has become Mubi's highest grossing film, surpassing the $10 million gross of Priscilla (2023).[172][173] Additionally, in its first week of PVOD release, it ranked #3 on iTunes and #6 on Fandango at Home.[174] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 90% of 346 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Audaciously gross, wickedly clever, and possibly Demi Moore's finest hour, The Substance is a gasp-inducing feat from writer-director Coralie Fargeat.\"[175] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 78 out of 100, based on 57 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[176] On AlloCiné, the film received an average rating of 3.6 out of 5, based on 39 reviews, from French critics.[177] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale, while those surveyed by PostTrak gave it an 80% overall positive score (including an average of 4 out of 5 stars), with 75% saying they would definitely recommend it.[2] Peter Bradshaw's four-star review in The Guardian called it \"a cheerfully silly and outrageously indulgent piece of gonzo body-horror comedy.\"[178] David Ehrlich of IndieWire graded the film an A, calling it \"an epic, audacious body horror masterpiece ... an instant classic. The most sickly entertaining theatrical experience of the year.\"[179] Nicholas Barber of the BBC awarded the film four stars out of five, while singling out Moore's performance: \"Ripping into her best big-screen role in decades, Demi Moore is fearless in parodying her public image.\"[180] Phil de Semlyen's five star review in Time Out said it is \"Moore who glues it all together, going full Isabelle Adjani-in-Possession in a vanity-free performance full of bruised ego, dawning horror and vulnerability.\"[181] Owen Gleiberman of Variety praised the film's director: \"Coralie Fargeat works with the flair of a grindhouse Kubrick in a weirdly fun, cathartically grotesque fusion of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Showgirls.\"[182] Radhika Seth of Vogue called it an \"audacious piece of filmmaking ... the most exciting release to have debuted on the Croisette so far\" and that it was her \"current pick to win the Palme d'Or.\"[183] Damon Wise of Deadline said it is \"a riotous, dreamlike horror-thriller that ends in a delirious symphony of blood, guts and otherwise undefinable viscera.\"[184] Javier Ocaña of El País wrote that the film \"is not that great\", partly \"because subtlety is not Fargeat's greatest virtue\", but \"mostly because the first 45 minutes seem like a covert remake\" of John Frankenheimer's [superior] Seconds.[185] Many filmmakers, including Ana Lily Amirpour, Edward Berger, Davy Chou, Kelly Fremon Craig, Robert Eggers, Adam Elliot, Hannah Fidell, Michael Gracey, Kitty Green, Laurel Parmet and Juel Taylor cited it as among their favorite films of 2024.[186] Wendy Ide of The Guardian praised The Substance for its feminist perspective of older women, making note of how other female-led horror films like Carrie or Rosemary's Baby centre on themes of menstruation and childbirth. She wrote that The Substance, in contrast, \"not only offers a female perspective on women's bodies, but also argues that things only start to get properly messy once fertility is a dim memory.\"[187] The New York Times critic Alissa Wilkinson noted the satirically exaggerated camera angles and shots, depicting the female characters in a way \"that feels reminiscent mostly of porn\" and noted \"the absurd standards for female beauty and the destructive power of celebrity\".[188] Alison Willmore of Vulture said that the film's strongest theme is about the dangers of addiction, comparing it to Requiem for a Dream.[189] Several critics have noted the film's similarities to Oscar Wilde's 1890 novel The Picture of Dorian Gray.[note 10]",

                "content": "National Football League (1970–present) The Cincinnati Bengals are a professional American football team based in Cincinnati. The Bengals compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) North division. The team plays its home games at Paycor Stadium in downtown Cincinnati.[7] Former Cleveland Browns head coach Paul Brown began planning for the creation of the Bengals franchise in 1965, and Cincinnati's city council approved the construction of Riverfront Stadium in 1966. Finally, in 1967, the Bengals were founded when a group headed by Brown received franchise approval by the American Football League (AFL) on May 23, 1967, and they began play in the 1968 season.[8] Brown was the Bengals' head coach from their inception to 1975. After being dismissed as the Browns' head coach by Art Modell (who had purchased a majority interest in the team in 1961) in January 1963, Brown had shown interest in establishing another NFL franchise in Ohio and looked at both Cincinnati and Columbus. He ultimately chose the former when a deal between the city, Hamilton County, and Major League Baseball's Cincinnati Reds (who were seeking a replacement for the obsolete Crosley Field) was struck that resulted in an agreement to build a multipurpose stadium which could host both baseball and football games. Due to the impending merger of the AFL and the NFL, which was scheduled to take full effect in the 1970 season, Brown agreed to join the AFL as its 10th and final franchise. The Bengals, like the other former AFL teams, were assigned to the AFC following the merger. Cincinnati was also selected because, like their neighbors the Reds, they could draw from several large neighboring cities (Louisville and Lexington, Kentucky; Columbus, Dayton, and Springfield, Ohio) that are all no more than 110 miles (180 km) away from downtown Cincinnati, along with Indianapolis, until the Baltimore Colts relocated there prior to the 1984 NFL season.[9] After Paul Brown's death in 1991, controlling interest in the team was inherited by his son, Mike Brown. In 2011, Brown purchased shares of the team owned by the estate of co-founder Austin Knowlton and is now the majority owner of the Bengals franchise.[7] The Bengals won the AFC championship in 1981, 1988, and in 2021. After each of the 1981 and 1988 conference championships, they went on to lose to the San Francisco 49ers, in Super Bowls XVI and XXIII. The team struggled greatly in the 1990s and the early 2000s, during which time they were sometimes referred to disparagingly as \"The Bungles,\" a term coined by Steelers broadcaster Myron Cope.[10] [11][12][13][14] Following the 1990 season, the team went 14 years without making the NFL playoffs or posting a winning record. The Bengals went through several head coaches in that period, and many of their top draft picks did not pan out. The team's fortunes improved in the mid-2000s and into the mid-2010s, which saw them become more consistent postseason contenders, but they continued to struggle in the playoffs.[15][16][17][18] The turning point for the Bengals was during the 2021 season, when they won their first playoff game in 31 years and advanced to the first of two consecutive AFC Championship games. In 2021, they defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 27–24 in overtime and advanced to Super Bowl LVI, their first appearance in the Super Bowl in 33 years, where they lost to the Los Angeles Rams 23–20.[19] They advanced to the AFC Championship game again in 2022 but lost to the eventual Super Bowl champions, the Chiefs, by a score of 23–20 (the same exact score as in Super Bowl LVI).[20] The team does not have an official general manager. However, Duke Tobin is the Bengals’ “de facto general manager” because he handles most personnel decisions.[21] In a 2011 survey, Brown was rated as among the worst team owners in American professional sports.[22] In a Forbes article on the value of NFL teams as of August 2022, the Cincinnati Bengals were ranked last with a value of $3 billion.[23] In 1967, an ownership group led by Paul Brown was granted a franchise in the American Football League. Brown named the team the Bengals in order \"to give it a link with past professional football in Cincinnati\".[24] Another Cincinnati Bengals team had existed in the city and played in three previous American Football Leagues[25] from 1937 to 1942. The city's world-renowned zoo was also home to a rare white Bengal tiger. In a possible insult to Art Modell – or possibly as a homage to the Massillon Tigers – Brown chose the exact shade of orange used by his former team. He added black as the secondary color. Brown chose a very simple logo: the word \"BENGALS\" in black lettering. One of the potential helmet designs Brown rejected was a striped motif that was similar to the helmets adopted by the team in 1981 still in use today; however, that design featured stripes which were more uniform in width.[26] The Bengals began play in the 1968 season. In 1966, the American Football League agreed to a merger with its older and more established rival, the National Football League.[27] Among the terms of the merger was that the AFL was permitted to add one additional franchise; the NFL wanted an even number of clubs in the merged league, so a team needed to be added to bring the number of clubs in the merged league to 26 teams. For the AFL, a key motive behind their agreement to accept a new team was that the guarantee of an eventual place in the NFL meant the league could charge a steep expansion fee of $10 million – 400 times the $25,000 the original eight owners paid when they founded the league in 1960. The cash from the new team provided the American Football League with the funds needed to pay the indemnities required to be paid by the AFL to the NFL, as stipulated by the merger agreement. Prior to the merger's announcement, Brown had not seriously considered joining the American Football League and was not a supporter of what he openly regarded to be an inferior competition, once famously stating that \"I didn't pay ten million dollars to be in the AFL.\"[28] However, with the announcement of the merger, Brown realized that the AFL expansion franchise would likely be his only realistic path back into the NFL in the short to medium term, and ultimately acquiesced to joining the AFL after learning that the team was guaranteed to become an NFL franchise after the merger was completed in 1970. There was also a major problem: Major League Baseball's Cincinnati Reds were in need of a facility to replace Crosley Field, which they had used since 1912. By this time, the small park was antiquated and rundown, and parking issues had plagued the city since the early 1950s, while the park also lacked modern amenities – issues that were exacerbated by the Mill Creek Expressway (I-75) project that ran alongside the park. While New York City – which had lost both its National League teams in 1957 after the Dodgers relocated to Los Angeles, and the Giants relocated to San Francisco – had actively courted Reds owner Powel Crosley to relocate his team there, Crosley was adamant that the Reds remain in Cincinnati and tolerated the worsening problems with the Crosley Field location. With assistance from Ohio governor Jim Rhodes, Hamilton County and the Cincinnati city council agreed to build a single multi-purpose facility on the dilapidated riverfront section of the city: the new facility had to be ready by the opening of the 1970 NFL season, and was officially named Riverfront Stadium. With the completion of the merger in 1970, the Cleveland Browns were one of three NFL teams that agreed to move to the AFL-based American Football Conference to give both conferences an equal number of teams and were placed in the AFC Central, the same division as the Bengals. An instant rivalry was born, fueled initially by Paul Brown's rivalry with Art Modell.[29][30] For their first two seasons, the Bengals played at Nippert Stadium, the current home of the University of Cincinnati Bearcats.[31] The team held training camp at Wilmington College in Wilmington, through the 1968 preseason. The team finished its first season with a 3–11 record[32] and running back Paul Robinson, who rushed for 1,023 yards, and was named the AFL Rookie of the Year.[33] Founder Paul Brown coached the team for its first eight seasons.[34] One of Brown's college draft strategies was to draft players from non-traditional football schools. Punter/wide receiver Pat McInally attended Harvard University, and linebacker Reggie Williams attended Dartmouth College and served on Cincinnati city council while on the Bengals' roster. Because of this policy, many former players went on to have successful careers in commentary and broadcasting as well as the arts. In addition, Brown had a knack for locating and recognizing pro football talent in unusual places.[35] In 1970, the Bengals moved to play at Riverfront Stadium, a home they shared with the Cincinnati Reds until the team moved to Paul Brown Stadium in 2000. Notable players of the 1970 team included Virgil Carter, Chip Meyers, Jack Meckstroth, Bob Trumpy, and Lemar Parrish. Virgil Carter threw for 1,647 yards. Chip Myers paced all receivers, catching 32 passes for 542 yards. Bob Trumpy contributed to the receiving game, too.[36] The team reached the playoffs three times during that decade, but could not win any of those postseason games. In 1975, the team posted an 11–3 record, giving them what remains the highest winning percentage (.786) in franchise history. But it only earned them a wild card spot in the playoffs, behind the 12–2 Pittsburgh Steelers, who went on to win the Super Bowl; the Bengals lost to the Oakland Raiders 31–28 in the divisional playoffs.[37] The Bengals reached the Super Bowl twice during the 1980s – in Super Bowl XVI and Super Bowl XXIII – and lost against the San Francisco 49ers both times.[38][39] The team appeared in the playoffs in 1990, making it to the second round before losing to the Los Angeles Raiders.[40] Before the following season got underway, Paul Brown died at age 82.[41] Due to declining health, he had already transferred control to his son, Mike Brown, but was reported to still influence the daily operations of the team.[42] The Bengals' fortunes changed for the worse as the team posted 14 consecutive non-winning seasons and were saddled with numerous draft busts. The Bengals began to emerge from that dismal period into a new era of increased consistency, however, after the team finished with its worst record in team history, 2–14, which led to the hiring of Marvin Lewis as head coach in 2003.[43] Carson Palmer, the future star quarterback, was drafted in 2003, but did not play a snap that whole season, as Jon Kitna had a comeback year (voted NFL Comeback Player of the Year).[44][45] Despite Kitna's success, Palmer was promoted to starting quarterback the following season.[46] The team finished with an 8–8 record and missed the postseason in 2004.[47] Under Palmer, the team advanced to the playoffs for the first time since 1990 losing in the Wild Card Roundto the Pittsburgh Steelers 31–17 in the 2005 season, which also was the first time the team had a winning percentage above .500 since 1990.[48][49][50] The Bengals returned to the playoffs again in 2009 in a season that included the franchise's first-ever division sweep. This was especially impressive since two of the teams swept by the Bengals – the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens – had made it to the AFC Championship Game the previous season. Marvin Lewis was rewarded for the accomplishment with the NFL Coach of the Year Award.[51] In the 2010 season, the Bengals posted a 4–12 record.[52] Following the disappointing 2010 season, quarterback Carson Palmer demanded to be traded. When the Bengals refused to do so, Palmer announced his retirement from the NFL.[53] He later was moved at the NFL trade deadline to the Oakland Raiders.[54] In the 2011 NFL draft, the Bengals selected wide receiver A. J. Green in the first round and quarterback Andy Dalton in the second round.[55] The Bengals improved to 9–7 in the 2011 season, and clinched a playoff spot.[56] Dalton and Green became the most prolific rookie WR-QB duo in history, connecting 65 times for 1,057 yards. However, they lost to the Houston Texans, 31–10, in the Wild Card round.[57] In the 2012 season, the Bengals clinched a playoff spot once more with a win over the Pittsburgh Steelers, going to the playoffs in back-to-back years for the first time since 1982.[58] However, the Bengals faced the Texans in the first round yet again and took another early exit, losing 19–13.[59] In the 2013 season, for the third straight year, the Bengals clinched a playoff berth and also won the AFC North, finishing with an 11–5 record.[60] But once again, the Bengals were defeated in the wild card round, this time by the San Diego Chargers, 27–10.[61] Most of the blame was put on Andy Dalton, who threw two interceptions and fumbled on a forward dive. This made the Bengals 0–5 in playoff games since Mike Brown took over as owner. The 2014 season started well, with the Bengals winning their first three contests against the Baltimore Ravens, Atlanta Falcons, and Tennessee Titans. However, they lost their Week 5 road matchup with the New England Patriots, 43–17. An overtime tie with the Carolina Panthers and a shutout loss to the Indianapolis Colts followed the primetime loss to the Patriots. Finishing the season 10–5–1 as the fifth seed, they lost to the Colts, 26–10, in the first round of the playoffs.[62][63] This was the first time the franchise made the playoffs four straight seasons. In 2015, the Bengals got out to a franchise-best 8–0 start with a 31–10 win over the Cleveland Browns.[64] Unfortunately, in Week 14 they would lose starting quarterback Andy Dalton to injury. He would not return that season, leaving A. J. McCarron to start under center. The Bengals finished with a franchise record-tying 12–4 mark.[65] Additionally, they lost to the division rival Pittsburgh Steelers, 18–16, in the Wild Card round in the final minute, making them the first franchise in NFL history to lose five straight opening-round playoff games.[66] This frustration continued in 2016 for the Bengals: they finished the 2016 campaign with a 6–9–1 record, losing several key players to injury, including A. J. Green, Giovani Bernard, and Jeremy Hill.[67][68] They missed the playoffs for the first time since 2010, marking the first time Andy Dalton missed the playoffs as the Bengals' starting quarterback. One notable game was a 27–27 tie against the Washington Redskins which was played in London in 2016.[69] Following a rough 2016 season, the Bengals looked forward into 2017. However, after starting 0–3, the Bengals never found their footing. At one point in the season, the Bengals were 5–9. There were rumors that Marvin Lewis would not return for the next season as the Bengals' head coach. However, after two come-from-behind victories over the Lions and Ravens that eliminated both teams from the playoffs, the Bengals finished 7–9.[70] The final two games were convincing enough for owner Mike Brown to give Lewis a new two-year contract.[71] The 2018 campaign began with promise for the Bengals under Lewis. Cincinnati began the season with a 4–1 record with impressive wins over the Colts, Ravens, Falcons, and Dolphins. However, the Bengals suffered many setbacks after the hot start: defensive coordinator Teryl Austin was fired mid-season because of defensive woes,[72] A. J. Green was injured and officially out for the last four games, and Andy Dalton injured his thumb in the Bengals' first game against the Browns and replaced by Jeff Driskel for the rest of the season.[73][74] The Bengals ended 2018 with a final record of 6–10 and finished last place in the AFC North.[75] On December 31, 2018, with one year to go on his contract, Lewis and the Bengals mutually parted ways after three straight losing seasons under his watch.[76] In 2019, they hired head coach Zac Taylor.[77] The 2019 campaign started off with reasonable success, with the Bengals barely losing to Seattle 21–20 at CenturyLink Field; but what started with promise ended in disaster.[78] The Bengals then lost 10 more games and were 0–11 heading into December 2019. To open the month of December, they got their first win of the season against the Jets, 22–6, in Cincinnati.[79] They eventually lost to the Patriots and then to the Dolphins, 38–35, in overtime after Dalton led the team back from 23 points down in the fourth quarter. With the loss to the Dolphins, the Bengals officially clinched the No. 1 overall pick in the 2020 NFL draft.[80] They capped off the season with a win against the Cleveland Browns, finishing 2–14, equaling the 2002 season as the team's worst record in history.[81][82] In 2020, the Bengals improved under rookies Joe Burrow and Tee Higgins.[83] Starting the season with a 2–5–1 record going into the bye week, including an overtime tie to the Philadelphia Eagles. Going into Week 11 facing the Washington Football Team, they lost Joe Burrow to a season-ending knee injury that all but ended their season, only winning two more contests against the Pittsburgh Steelers and Houston Texans.[84] Finishing the season 4–11–1.[85] In 2021, the Bengals won the AFC North with a 10–7 record, which included dominant sweeps of the rival Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Ravens.[86] Led by Joe Burrow, who was playing in his first full season after recovering from his devastating knee injury in Week 11 of his rookie season and rookie receiver, and Burrow's college teammate at LSU, Ja'Marr Chase, Cincinnati would win the AFC North for the first time since 2015. They beat the Kansas City Chiefs, 34–31, in a Week 17 thriller to clinch the division. They then won their first playoff game since the 1990 season, beating the Las Vegas Raiders, 26–19, in the Wild Card round.[87] After that, they upset the top-seeded Tennessee Titans, 19–16, when Evan McPherson kicked a game-winning 52-yard field goal. A week later, they advanced to their first Super Bowl since 1989 when McPherson kicked a 33-yard field goal in overtime to cap off a comeback from being down 21–3 and shock the No. 2 seed Chiefs, 27–24. They lost a close Super Bowl to the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LVI, 23–20.[88] In Week 1 of the 2022 NFL season, the Bengals lost, 23–20, to the Pittsburgh Steelers in overtime, breaking a three-game winning streak the Bengals had against Pittsburgh. After falling to a 4–4 record in Week 8, the Bengals proceeded to win 8 straight games to tie a franchise-record for single-season wins and earn a 3 seed in the AFC playoffs.[89][90] They defeated divisional rival Baltimore in the first round 24–17, behind a 98-yard fumble recovery returned for a touchdown by Sam Hubbard.[91][92] Despite missing three starting offensive linemen, the Bengals followed that up with a decisive 27–10 road win over the favored Buffalo Bills to reach a second straight AFC Championship appearance for the first time in franchise history.[93] Once again, they faced the Kansas City Chiefs in the Championship Game, but this time they lost 23–20, in another thrilling game.[94] In the 2023 season, during their Week 11 matchup against the Baltimore Ravens, Joe Burrow would suffer a wrist injury that would rule him out the rest of the season.[95] The consistent play of backup quarterback Jake Browning kept the Bengals alive in the postseason hunt after Burrow's injury.[96] The Bengals finished the season 9–8 and missed the playoffs.[97] When the team debuted in 1968, the Bengals' uniforms were modeled after the Cleveland Browns. When Paul Brown was fired by Art Modell, Brown still owned the equipment used by Cleveland, so after the firing, Paul Brown packed up all his equipment, which he then used for his new team in Cincinnati. The Cleveland Browns' team colors were brown, orange, and white, and their helmets were solid orange with a white dorsal stripe over the crest. The Bengals' team colors were orange, black, and white, and their helmets were a similar shade of orange, with the only variations being the word \"Bengals\" in black block letters (with a white outline) on either side of the helmet and no stripe on the helmet. The Cincinnati Bengals were unique in the NFL, as they did not have secondary uniform numbers on the jerseys (called \"TV numbers\") until they appeared on the sleeves in the 1980 season; they were the only NFL team that didn't have them prior to that point. That same year, the team changed their helmet face mask color from gray to black. The team did not discard their Cleveland-like uniforms until 1981. During that year, a then-unique uniform design was introduced: Although the team kept black jerseys, white jerseys, and white pants, they were now trimmed with orange and black tiger stripes. The team also introduced the orange helmets with black tiger stripes that are still in use today. Sports Illustrated likened the Bengals' new helmets to \"varicose pumpkins.\"[98] In 1997, the Bengals designed a logo consisting of a leaping tiger, and it was added to the uniform sleeves (with this, the TV numbers moved to the shoulder). Another alternate logo consisted of a Bengal's head facing to the left. However, the orange helmet with black tiger stripes continued to be the trademark. In 2004, a new tiger stripe pattern and more accents were added to the uniforms. The black jerseys now featured orange tiger-striped sleeves and white side panels, while the white jerseys began to use black tiger-striped sleeves and orange shoulders.[99] A new logo consisting of an orange \"B\" covered with black tiger stripes was introduced.[100] The team also started rotating black pants and debuted an alternate orange jersey, with white side panels and black tiger-striped sleeves. The Bengals have worn their black uniforms at home throughout their history, with some exceptions, such as the 1970 season, when the Bengals wore white at home for the entire season as well as most of the 1971 season (the Bengals were the first AFL team to wear white at home, as its rules required the home team to wear their dark jerseys, unlike the NFL, which allowed the home team choice of jersey color starting in 1964). Since 2005, the Bengals have worn white for September home games where the heat could become a factor. In 2016, the Bengals unveiled their all-white Color Rush alternate uniform, featuring black tiger stripes along the sleeves and pants. Orange was only used on the Nike mark, on the team logo, and as an outline color on the player's name.[101] The club announced a new uniform design on January 21, 2021. The new uniform design would be worn beginning with the 2021 NFL season.[102] The set retains the signature striped helmet, while simplifying the look by removing the side and shoulder panels, creating a new stripe pattern for the sleeves, getting rid of the number block shadow, and removing the stroke on the player's name. This set also puts the team's wordmark on the chest and lacks TV numbers on the sleeves. The shade of orange was changed, as well. The Bengals wore three different pants with this set: black pants with orange stripes, white pants with black stripes, and white pants with orange stripes. The white pants with black stripes were worn with the white jersey in 2021 playoff games at Tennessee and Kansas City. The white pants with orange stripes were worn with the black jersey in Super Bowl LVI against the Rams.[103] In 2022, after the NFL rescinded the \"one-helmet rule,\" the Bengals unveiled an alternate black-striped white helmet. In addition, the team brought back the all-white Color Rush uniform to be paired with the white helmets.[104][105] This would last one season, however, as the team decided to pair the white helmet with the primary white uniform for two games in 2023, effectively retiring the Color Rush uniform for the time being.[106] In 2024, the Bengals added orange pants to the uniform rotation after Madden NFL 25 leaked the option to the public.[107] The Bengals then unveiled a new all-orange uniform combination to be worn September 8 against the Patriots.[108] The team's official mascot is a Bengal tiger named Who Dey.[109] Its jersey number is 1.[110] Aside from Who Dey, the team also has the Ben-Gals, the team's cheerleading squad,[111] which included Laura Vikmanis, the oldest cheerleader in league history.[112] Carol Motsinger in 2015 said, \"In 2012, Cincinnati welcomed another tiger named Who Dey. This time, one that walks on four legs. More than 1,000 Bengals season ticket holders named a Malayan tiger Who Dey at Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden. He was recently traded to a zoo in Kansas.\"[113] The Ohio History Central notes: \"In 1940, a third American Football League formed, and the Cincinnati Bengals joined it. Unfortunately, World War II began the following year, causing manpower shortages as men joined the armed forces. This prompted this newer AFL to cease playing after the 1941 season. Paul Brown, former coach of the Cleveland Browns, received authorization from a modern American Football League to create a team in Cincinnati. Brown chose the name Bengals to memorialize the teams of the same name that had represented Cincinnati in the past.\"[114] The Bengals' historic rivalry with the Cleveland Browns is often referred to as the \"Battle of Ohio\", started as the result of former Browns head coach and team founder Paul Brown starting the Bengals franchise after leaving the Browns.[115] The colors of each team are similar since Paul Brown chose the exact shade of orange used by the Browns for the Bengals, and the Bengals' original uniforms were identical to the Browns' uniforms, excluding the word \"Bengals\" on the helmet. The rivalry reached its peak during the 1980s when both teams were vying viciously for a spot in the playoffs. During the 1990s the rivalry also butted heads when Brown's sons were in charge of the day-to-day operations of the Bengals.[116] The Bengals lead the series 53–48 as of the end of the 2023 season.[117] The Bengals and Pittsburgh Steelers have played each other twice a year since becoming division rivals in 1970. This rivalry has gained intensity since the 2000s, as the teams have met twice in the playoffs, with both games being marked by hard hits and injuries with the most infamous example occurring in the 2005 playoffs.[118][119][120] The Steelers lead the overall series 70–39 and the postseason series 2–0.[121] However, the Steelers have been more dominant recently, posting a record of 28–7 since 2004, when they drafted Roethlisberger. There were two times that the rivalry has met during the playoffs: the Wild Card rounds of 2005 and 2015, with the Steelers winning both meetings at Cincinnati. The 2005 game is marked as a special time in the rivalry because this is when Steelers defensive tackle Kimo Von Oelhoffen injured Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer,[122] while the 2015 game is also special because Bengals running back Jeremy Hill fumbled the ball in the waning minutes when the Bengals had a 16–15 lead over the Steelers to give the latter one last chance. They used that chance wisely as they drove down the field (with the help of two costly personal fouls by the Bengals) and kicked a game-winning field goal.[123] The Bengals' rivalry with the Baltimore Ravens began when the original Browns franchise relocated to Baltimore to become the Ravens. Since then, the rivalry heated up when longtime Ravens defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis was hired as the head coach of the Bengals. The Ravens lead the all-time series 30–27 as of the 2023 season.[124] The Bengals won the only playoff meeting in the 2022 AFC Wild Card round.[125] The Joe Burrow-led Bengals have developed a recent rivalry with the Kansas City Chiefs, with Burrow being the only AFC quarterback to date to hold a winning record against Mahomes.[126] As of the 2023 season, the Bengals lead the all-time series 18–16.[127] The Bengals have played the Titans more than any non-divisional opponent by a significant margin. The Titans lead the all-time series 41–37–1.[128] A no-huddle offense was commonly used by all teams when time in the game was running low. However, Sam Wyche, the head coach of the Bengals in 1988, along with offensive coordinator Bruce Coslet, made the high-paced offense the standard modality for the ball club regardless of time remaining. By quickly substituting and setting up for the next play—often within 5–10 seconds after the last play despite being afforded 45 seconds—the Bengals hindered the other team's defense from substituting situational players, regrouping for tactics, and resting. In response, the NFL instituted rules allowing the defense ample time for substitutions when offensive substitutions were made. The hurry-up tactic was used by the franchise during the late 1980s while Sam Wyche was the coach. A rival for AFC supremacy during this time was the Buffalo Bills, coached by Marv Levy, who also used a version of the no-huddle offense starting with the 1989 season. The Bengals had beaten the Bills three times in 1988 (pre-season, regular season, and the AFC Championship Game). Marv Levy threatened to fake injuries if the Bengals used the \"no-huddle\" in the AFC Championship. Wyche was notified that the commissioner had ordered the \"no-huddle\" illegal for the game. The official notified Wyche and the Bengals' team just two hours before the game kickoff.[129] Wyche asked to talk directly to the commissioner and word immediately came back that the \"no-huddle\" would not be penalized. Levy did not have his players' fake injuries in the game but installed his version the next year, 1989. The Bengals first used the \"no-huddle\" in 1984.[130] Most of the high-profile games (the various games for AFC titles and regular-season games) between the two led to these changes in NFL rules. Wyche also first used the timeout periods as an opportunity to bring his entire team to the sideline to talk to all eleven players, plus substitutes, at one time. This allowed trainers time to treat a cut or bruise and equipment managers time to repair an equipment defect. The West Coast offense is the popular name for the high-percentage passing scheme designed by former Bengals assistant Bill Walsh.[131] Walsh formulated what has become popularly known as the West Coast offense during his tenure as assistant coach for the Cincinnati Bengals from 1968 to 1975, while working under the tutelage of Brown (and before embarking on his legendary coaching tenure with the San Francisco 49ers in the 1980s). Bengals quarterback Virgil Carter was the first player to successfully implement Walsh's system, leading the NFL in pass completion percentage in 1971.[132] Ken Anderson replaced Carter as Cincinnati's starting quarterback in 1972 and was even more successful. In 1975 he would bring widespread recognition to the West Coast offense as well as to the Cincinnati team and its quarterback in a nationally televised Monday night contest between the Bengals and a Buffalo Bills team built around the running game of star player O. J. Simpson. Anderson's 447 passing yards were enough to overcome Simpson's 197 yards on the ground in a game that proved a milestone, providing a striking contrast between the \"old\" game of defense-minded football and the new game of higher scores and more action through a sophisticated aerial attack.[133] The game, in effect, offered its viewers a glimpse of the future of professional football. Anderson, who was drafted by Paul Brown in 1971 and installed as starting quarterback in 1972, made four trips to the Pro Bowl, won four passing titles, was named NFL MVP in 1981, and set the record for completion percentage in a single season in 1982 with 70.66%. Defeated frequently during the 1970s by the Pittsburgh Steelers, a team that won four Super Bowls with 9 future Hall of Fame players, the Bengals under Anderson and head coach Forrest Gregg would finally break through the Steel Curtain, defeating the Steelers during both of their meetings in 1980 and again in 1981. Anderson, who had been named the \"team franchise\" by Bengal tight end Bob Trumpy, would ultimately prove his worth with a career record of 91 wins and 81 losses.[134] The defense created to combat the West Coast offense also came from Cincinnati. Then-Bengals defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau (who later served as the team's head coach from 2000 to 2002) created the zone blitz in the 1980s in response to the West Coast offense.[135] Running backs (RB) Wide receivers (WR) Tight ends (TE) Defensive linemen (DL) Defensive backs (DB) Special teams Reserve 53 active, 14 reserve, 15 practice squad In addition, Despite not being formally retired, the Bengals have certain numbers that are in limited circulation: There are four members of the Hall of Fame that have spent some portion of their career with the Bengals, but only Anthony Muñoz and Ken Riley spent their entire playing careers with the Bengals. Listed below are only Hall of Famers whose induction includes their tenure with the Bengals. Bengals founder and first coach Paul Brown is in the Hall of Fame, but was inducted before founding the team and is not credited as a Bengals Hall of Famer. Additionally, the Bengals have had two head coaches, Forrest Gregg and Dick LeBeau inducted for their playing career. In 2007, in celebration of their 40th anniversary the Bengals named an all-time team voted on by the fans.[148] Source:[149] The Bengals announced they would begin a Ring of Honor in 2021.[150] The inaugural class included Pro Football Hall of Fame tackle Anthony Muñoz and Paul Brown, who was the franchise's founder and first coach,[151] with Ken Anderson and Ken Riley added after a season ticket holder vote.[152] *Posthumous induction → Coaching staff → Front office → More NFL staffs The Bengals contract with iHeartMedia as their radio partner,[153] with their flagship radio stations being WCKY (1530) and WEBN (102.7 FM), along with WLW (700) if not in conflict with the Reds. Most preseason and regular season games, are telecast on WKRC-TV, channel 12, the CBS affiliate. Mike Watts and Anthony Muñoz are the TV announcers for preseason games, with Mike Valpredo as the sideline reporter.[154] Games that feature an NFC opponent playing at Paycor Stadium will be televised on WXIX, channel 19, the local Fox affiliate. WLWT-TV airs games when the Bengals are featured on Sunday Night Football. The radio broadcasting crew consists of Dan Hoard (play-by-play), and Dave Lapham (analyst).[155] \"The Bengal Growl\" is the Bengals fight song. It was written by Bengals entertainment director George \"Red\" Bird upon the team's founding in 1968. Bird had been friends with Paul Brown for over 30 years. The two had met at Massillon Washington High School when Brown was head football coach and Bird was director of the famed Massillon Tiger Swing Band. Bird had served as the Browns' music and entertainment director in 1946, and kept that role until Brown convinced him to come to Cincinnati in 1968. His first task was to pen a fight song along the lines of the Browns' fight song, \"Hi! O-Hi-O for Cleveland!\" The song remains very popular among Bengals fans, who are known to belt out the song at \"Bengals backer\" bars all over the country. In 2021, Elizabeth Blackburn, now the team's head of strategy and fan engagement, told The Athletic recalled stopping at one such bar in San Francisco during the 2015 playoffs, and was surprised to hear the viewers break out into the song. As a measure of how popular the song remains among the Bengals fan base, when Blackburn wrote an editorial on her efforts to overhaul the team's image for the Bengals Web site, Blackburn specifically mentioned that the song was not going anywhere.[156] \"Welcome to the Jungle\" is also a fight song for the Bengals.[157][158] The song is mainly played before kick-offs to intimidate visiting teams. \"Who Dey?!\" is the name of a chant of support by fans of the Cincinnati Bengals, in use since the 1980s. The entire chant is: \"Who dey, who dey, who dey think gonna beat dem Bengals?\"[159] The answer screamed in unison, \"Nobody.\" Sometimes fans will instead shout \"Who Dey?\" to represent the entire cheer. \"Who Dey\" is also the name of the team's mascot, a Bengal tiger.[110] Saying \"Who Dey\" at Bengals games is steeped in local beer lore. Hudy, a leading product of Hudepohl Brewing Company 1978 through the late 1980s, bears a phonetic similarity to the \"Who Dey\" chant. Beer vendors who carried full cases of bottled local beer up and down the steep upper stairs of what was then Riverfront Stadium would call out \"If Hudy\", \"Burger\" and other local beer names. Raucous fans would often chant back and forth with them as the vendors called out. During the 1980 season, the banter with the Hudepohl vendors grew organically into the now famous (Hu-Dey) -Who They?- chant.[160] The full Who Dey chant was first known to be used by fans of the 1980 Cincinnati Bengals.[161] While the origin of the chant is disputed, one possible source for the chant is a 1980 commercial for (the now-defunct) Red Frazier Ford of Cincinnati, which used this tagline: \"Who's going to give you a better deal than Red Frazier?...Nobody!\" Cincinnati fans who had seen the commercial many times may have just copied it when cheering.[162] The chant bears some similarities to the phrase \"Who Dat?\", which was officially adopted by the New Orleans Saints in 1983 but had been used by Louisiana's high school team fans for some time. The saying \"Who Dat?\" originated in minstrel shows and vaudeville acts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, then it was taken up by New Orleans Jazz and various Big band folks in the 1920s and 1930s. In the late 1960s, local Louisiana High Schools, St. Augustine High School and Patterson High School reportedly have been using the cheer and Gulf Coast fans of Alcorn State University and Louisiana State University picked up the cheer in the 1970s. Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana claims to have originated the cheer in the late 1960s in their version: \"Who dat talking 'bout beating dem Jags?\"[163]",

                "title": "Texan English - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Texan English is the array of American English dialects spoken in Texas, primarily falling under Southern U.S. English. As one nationwide study states, the typical Texan accent is a \"Southern accent with a twist\".[1] The \"twist\" refers to inland Southern U.S., older coastal Southern U.S., and South Midland U.S. accents mixing together, due to Texas's settlement history, as well as some lexical (vocabulary) influences from Mexican Spanish.[1] In fact, there is no single accent that covers all of Texas and few dialect features are unique to Texas alone. The newest and most innovative Southern U.S. accent features are best reported in Lubbock, Odessa, somewhat Houston and variably Dallas, though general features of this same dialect are found throughout the state, with several exceptions:[2] Abilene and somewhat Austin, Corpus Christi, and El Paso appear to align more with Midland U.S. accents than Southern ones. After Mexico gained independence in 1821, Mexican Texas legally permitted an influx of American settlers mainly from the Southern United States,[3] who within a decade outnumbered Hispanics in Texas,[4] making English as common as Spanish in central and north Texas. After Texas became an independent republic in 1836, English, with its distinct Southern influences, became the predominant language. After the Mexican Revolution of 1910–1920, a great number of Spanish-speaking Mexicans immigrated to Texas,[5][6] slowing down in the mid-20th century only to increase massively since 1990,[4] driving the development of a young Spanish-influenced dialect of Texan English: Tejano English. Some linguists draw dialect boundaries based upon phonological (sound-pattern) differences and others on lexical (word-usage) differences, leading to various views on how to classify dialects in Texas, often by dividing the state into an eastern versus a western dialect region.[7] 20th-century lexical research delimited Texas into two \"layers\": a southern Texas layer along the Mexican border with several Spanish loanwords and a central Texas layer settled by speakers of German and other European languages amidst a dominant Anglo-American settlement.[8][9] 21st-century phonological research reveals accents in Texas grouped in a way not easy to demarcate in terms of simple geographical boundaries,[10] and ongoing research reveals an urban–rural divide within Texas becoming more significant than a region-wide divide. Some linguists propose that urbanization, geographic and social mobility, and the mass media have homogenized the speech of the United States to a national norm.[11] Due to rapid urbanization, increasing dominance of high tech industries, and massive migrations, Texan speech has been reshaped as well, especially since 1990.[4] The general tendency in the phonology of Texas English is that mergers expand at the expense of distinctions, although traditional Southern-style Texan English preserved older phonemic distinctions.[11] Since much of the traditional regional vocabulary concerned farming and rural life, these terms are now disappearing or being replaced by technical terms.[11] As stated above, an internal rural–urban split is emerging within Texan English, meaning that most traditionally Southern (or stereotypically Texan) features remain strong in rural areas but tend to disappear in large urban areas and small cities.[4] The urban-rural linguistic split mainly affects Southern-style phonological phenomena like the pen-pin merger, the loss of the offglide in /aɪ/, and upgliding diphthongs, all of which are now recessive in metropolitan areas.[4] Meanwhile, some traditional grammatical features like y'all and fixin' to are expanding to non-natives in metropolitan areas as well as to the Hispanic population.[4] Essentially all Texas English phonologically falls under the Southeastern super-dialect region of the United States and often specifically the Southern dialect region, though noticeably not the cities of El Paso, Abilene, and Austin, and not particularly Houston and Corpus Christi.[2] Moreover, as of 21st-century research, the accents of Dallas show enormous variability.[10] Texas English may use many grammatical constructions typically associated with Southern U.S. English, including fixin' to,[19] multiple modals like might could and should oughta (reportedly used by every social class and, as of the 1980s Linguistic Atlas of the Gulf States, predominately in Upper and Lower East Texas), and plural verbal -s as in Our father and mother helps used by both Black and (somewhat less commonly) white Texans.[20] Many of these lexical terms are shared with the Midland and Southern dialects generally: Due to Spain's past influence in Texas, the vocabulary of Texas is much more influenced by Spanish than the vocabulary of other states. Some of the Texan terms that originated from Spanish are listed below.[22] Texan English frequently shows up in the media. In the 1950s and 1960s, many Hollywood western movies like Giant, Hud, and The Alamo were set in Texas. In those movies, Hollywood stars like James Dean, Rock Hudson, Dennis Hopper, Paul Newman, and Patricia Neal first had to learn how to speak Texan English and were instructed by native Texans. Also the famous TV series Dallas was often characterized by Texan English. Texas Instruments sometimes uses Texan English in its products. The TIFORM software for its TI-990 minicomputer sometimes displayed \"Shut 'er Down Clancey She's a-Pumping Mud\" as a humorous error message.[28] The Texan accent gained nationwide fame with the presidency of native Texan Lyndon B. Johnson. A lifelong resident of the Texas Hill Country, Johnson's thick accent was a large part of his personality and brought attention and fame to the dialect.[4][29] The Texan dialect gained fame again when George W. Bush started to serve as president. He had moved to West Texas at the age of two and has since retained the Texan dialect. In his speech, words like \"America\" sometimes sound like \"Amur-kah\" or even just like \"Mur-kah\".[4][30] Former U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also speaks with a distinctively Texan accent.[31][32] Due to hundreds of years of Spanish and later Mexican intermingling, around 6 million (ca. 29%) people in Texas speak Spanish as the first language.[33] Recent data shows that Spanish is still increasing.[34] Since there are so many Spanish speakers in Texas, Spanish has a high impact on the English dialect spoken in Texas.[35] Many Mexican Americans in Texas speak their own variety of English which has many Spanish features (terms, phonology, etc.), Tejano English, a Chicano English dialect mostly spoken by working-class Mexican Americans. A very distinctive feature of that dialect is the /-t,d/-deletion in words which contain a /t/ or /d/ in the final position.[36]",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) Aaron Rodgers walked off the field with his buddy Davante Adams by his side, waved his left hand to the New York Jets fans cheering his name in the MetLife Stadium stands and walked through the dark tunnel to the locker room. “Yeah, that was cool,” Rodgers said with a smile. If this was it for the 41-year-old quarterback, he capped a storied career with a victory and some history. Rodgers threw a season-high four touchdown passes, becoming the fifth player to throw 500 career regular-season TD passes, in what could’ve been his final NFL game to lead the Jets to a 32-20 win over the Miami Dolphins on Sunday. “I just need some time away to think about my future in the game, and my future here if they want me to be a part of the next phase or they're ready to move on,\" Rodgers said. \"Either way, I’m thankful for my two years here.” Rodgers is uncertain if he wants to continue playing for a 21st season, and it's unclear if the Jets (5-12) - who'll have a new general manager and coach next season - will want to move forward with him. “Oh, I don't know,” Rodgers said when asked if he believes in his heart he'll be back with the Jets. “I honestly don't know.\" Owner Woody Johnson, vice chairman Christopher Johnson and team president Hymie Elhai are expected to chat with Rodgers at some point during the week as a hectic offseason begins for New York, which is already conducting interviews with GM and coach candidates. “I’m looking forward to those conversations,” Rodgers said. “It feels good to be able to do some of the things these last five or six weeks I know I was capable of doing, even at 40, 41. But either way, I won't be upset or offended with what they decide to do - if they want to move on, if I still want to play. “And if not, I'll let them know, if that's the case.” Rodgers finished 23 of 36 for 274 yards and TD passes to Tyler Conklin, Davante Adams, Allen Lazard and Breece Hall - and was intercepted by Tyrel Dodson on his first throw. He also helped shut the door on the Dolphins (8-9), who needed a victory to keep their playoff hopes alive. But that became moot when Denver routed Kansas City, which rested Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and several other starters, to clinch the final AFC postseason berth for the Broncos. The Dolphins might also be in for some offseason drama. After the game, star wide receiver Tyreek Hill appeared to indicate he wanted out of Miami. “This is the first time I haven’t been in the playoffs,” Hill told reporters. “For me, I have to do what’s best for me and my family, if that’s here or wherever the case may be. ... I’m opening the door. I’m out. It was great playing here.” Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel said he was “informed” Hill was “unavailable” before a drive in the second half - and McDaniel wasn't told Hill had an injury. McDaniel also didn't want to comment on Hill's statements until he spoke to the receiver. “We’ll see how the next couple of days progress with those conversations with him and I,” McDaniel said. With the Jets trailing 6-0 midway through the second quarter, Rodgers dropped back on first-and-goal from the 5, ran forward and then zipped a pass to Conklin in the end zone to join Tom Brady (649), Drew Brees (571), Peyton Manning (539) and Brett Favre (508) as the only players with 500 regular-season TD passes. Conklin handed Rodgers the ball as the entire offense celebrated in the end zone, hugging the quarterback and tapping him on the helmet. A strip-sack by Haason Reddick and Will McDonald and fumble recovery by Quincy Williams gave the Jets the ball back at the Miami 39 late in the second quarter. Rodgers added to his career TDs total on a 13-yard throw to Lazard with 59 seconds left in the first half. Hall ran for the 2-point conversion to put the Jets up 15-6. Greg Joseph, the franchise-record fifth kicker used by the Jets this season, booted a 20-yarder to make it 18-6 in the third quarter. De'Von Achane drew the Dolphins closer with a 15-yard touchdown run early in the fourth quarter. But Rodgers got No. 502 on a 4-yard touchdown pass to Adams, the 83rd time the two have connected for a score - moving them past Miami's Dan Marino and Mark Clayton for the third most by a quarterback-wide receiver combination. It gave New York a 25-13 lead. Miami wasn't finished as Tyler Huntley, who started at quarterback for the Dolphins in place of the injured Tua Tagovailoa, threw a 4-yard TD pass to Jonnu Smith that cut the Dolphins' deficit to 25-20 with 5:21 left. But Rodgers then capped his big day with a 6-yard touchdown toss to Hall with 2:30 remaining. Garrett Wilson had four catches to join Brandon Marshall as the only players in Jets history to have 100 receptions in a season. ... Adams caught six passes for 88 yards for his fifth straight season with 1,000 yards receiving. ... Ashtyn Davis had two interceptions for the Jets, who had four takeaways. ... Huntley was 25 of 41 for 227 yards and a touchdown with the two INTs. ... Achane ran for 121 yards, including a 61-yard scamper in the first quarter, and a score. A banner featuring the Jets' logo was unfurled by several dozen fans on the field - a typical pregame display before the national anthem - and it was upside down. It was quickly rolled back up and taken inside. Jets DL Quinnen Williams left in the second half with a hamstring injury. ... Jets OL Carter Warren injured an ankle in the fourth quarter. --- AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL Copyright 2025 STATS LLC and Associated Press.

                "content": "Filed under: The Miami Dolphins and New York Jets finished their 2024 regular season with an AFC East showdown. The Miami Dolphins visited their AFC East rivals, the New York Jets, in the regular season finale for 2024. The Week 18 meeting gives the Dolphins not just a chance to sweep the Jets this year, but could also lead to a Miami postseason appearance. The Dolphins, who made the playoffs the last two years, need to beat New York and hope the Kansas City Chiefs, who are resting most of their starters, beat the Denver Broncos. This game could be the final game - either as a Jets player or as a player period - for quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who has struggled this season. The Jets traded for Rodgers ahead of the 2023 season, but the quarterback tore his Achilles tendon in the first game of the season, leading to him missing the rest of the year. This season, the offense has been inconsistent at best, and the Jets are expected to look for a new quarterback in the offseason. How did the Dolphins at Jets season finale play out? We kept up with all of the action throughout the game, reacting as it happened. Miami opened the game with the ball, but the drive went nowhere. An incomplete pass from quarterback Tyler Huntley started the drive, with a screen pass to wide receiver Jaylen Waddle losing four yards on second down. After another screeen pass, this time to running back De’Von Achane, picked up six yards, the Dolphins punted on a three-and-out. Not the start you want to a game. Not the start you want to a game against your division rivals. And, not the start to a game that could get you into the playoffs. Not sure what happened their, but the Dolphins have to figure it out quickly and not rely on the defense to try to stop Aaron Rodgers. On the first play, Rodgers looked to wide receiver Davante Adams, but a blitz from cornerback Kader Kohou made him throw the ball early and a perfectly timed hit by safety Jevon Holland popped the ball in the air. Linebacker Tyrel Dodson caught the floating ball for the interception. Okay, maybe the offense can rely on the defense to stop Rodgers. Perfect start for the defense. The drive started with an Achane run for two yards, with Huntley then forced to scramble for six yards. On 3rd-and-2, the Dolphins could not pick up anything on an incomplete pass and they settled for the 26-yard field goal from kicker Jason Sanders. Starting with the ball at the Jets’ 15-yard line, Miami has to do better. This was essentially a three-and-out possession, but they were within field goal range to get points. Not good enough. Dolphins 3-0. Rodgers was able to find tight end Tyler Conklin for 11 yards to start the possession, but cornerback Jalen Ramsey decided not to allow anything else after that. On a double-pass attempt, Ramsey blew up Adams in the backfield forcing the incomplete pass, then again got to Adams for a one-yard loss on a screen attempt. An incomplete pass on 3rd-and-11 led to a Jets punt. Ramsey absolutely destroyed Adams on that hit. Just played through him to make sure he did not complete the catch. The defense came to play. The offense needs to get in on this. Achane burst through the line for a 20-yard gain to begin the drive. Two plays later, wide receiver Tyreek Hill gained seven yards on a pass to the sideline, setting up 3rd-and-3. The pass rush was able to get to Huntley, however, leading to a fumble, with tackle Terron Armstead balling on the ball. Miami was forced to punt. The offense showed a little life, which is great, but they have to do better still. Hill broke to the right on the third-down play, while Huntley looked like he was looking for an in-cut, leading to the sack. The two need to get back on the same page quickly. Meanwhile, the Broncos have scored their second touchdown to that a 14-0 lead. New York again started with an 11-yard gain, this time as running back Breece Hall picked up the yardage on a run. Hall lost three yards on the next to plays before Rodgers threw a pass to him for a five-yard gain. The Jets punted. Again, the defense has come to play. They are swarming to the ball and making stops quickly. If the offense can get into rhythm, the Dolphins can at least do their half of the playoff scenario. Miami began at their 14-yard line, facing a long field if they want to extend the lead. After picking up no yardage on an Achane run on first down, a dump off pass to fullback Alec Ingold turned into an eight-yard gain. Wide receiver Malik Washington converted the first down on a slant for nine yards, and the Dolphins started to look like they were finding their rhythm. After a trade of penalties, the Dolphins faced 1st-and-10 at their 31, with Huntley scrambling for five yards. Achane then broke free for a 61-yard gain, taking the ball to the Jets three-yard line before being tripped up. An Achane run for -4 yards, an incomplete pass, and a screen pass to tight end Jonnu Smith for -3 yards pushed the Dolphins back and they settled for another field goal. No. Just no. Achane broke free for 61 yards and a first and goal from the three, and the Dolphins lose seven yards and cannot get into the endzone. Simply not good enough. There is no excuse for the constant screens, especially when you are at the three-yard line. Just get into the endzone. Dolphins 6-0. After the break between quarters, the Jets started at their 30-yard line. A Rodgers pass to running back Braelon Allen picked up five yards, but two incomplete passes and a false start forced a three-and-out punt. Again, the defense is doing what the need to do. Of course, the Jets are on the same passing scheme as the Dolphins, basic only throwing to or behind the line of scrimmage. The Dolphins opened the possession trying to create confusion on the Jets’ defensive line, only to pitch the ball to running back Jaylen Wright to the right, and see him immediately hit for a nine-yard loss. Wight picked up a yard on second down, then a pass to Smith, caught two yards behind the line of scrimmage, gained 11 yards and led to a Miami punt. The offense just is doing nothing at all. Just nothing. And the Broncos just took a 21-0 lead with a three-tip-drill touchdown catch. New York figured out that the ball can be thrown past the line of scrimmage during the drive. After Hall picked up eight yards on a first down run, Rodgers threw for 16 yards to Adams, 11 yards to wide receiver Garrett Wilson, and 15 yards to wide receiver Allen Lazard. The Jets and Rodgers found their rhythm and three plays later, Rodgers looked to Wilson on a short pass, with the receiver breaking a tackle for a 20-yard gain. On the next play, Rodgers threw to Conklin in the endzone for the touchdown. Embarrassment. That is what is happening right now. The Dolphins just do not look like a team that has a chance at making the playoffs - no matter what is happening in the Broncos game. They are stuck with this short passing game, and now the defense is allowing Rodgers to carve them up. The Dolphins look worse than the 4-12 team they are playing. Someone needs to wake up right now because at this rate, 7-6 feels like took big of a deficit to overcome. Jets 7-6. Miami stared at their 40-yard line after an illegal kick penalty on the Jets, setting them up with great field position. Huntley scrambled away from pressure on the opening snap of the drive, finding Waddle for a 23-yard gain. He looked to Waddle again on the next play, throwing down to the Jets 10, but putting it where the receiver could not make a play and the Jets picked off the pass. Maybe that is why they are settling for the screens. That was just a bad pass and continues the offensive struggles in this game. The Jets gained 47 yards on the first six plays of the drive, moving from their 10-yard line to the Miami 43, in large part thanks for a 30-yard pass and run from Rodgers to Adams. The drive stalled there, however, as Hall was stopped after one yard, An incomplete pass and a four-yard gain on 3rd-and-9 led to a 4th-and-5 attempt. Defensive tackle Zach Sieler and linebacker Emmanuel Ogbah reached Rodgers for the sack and the turnover on downs. Great. The defense made a stop. If the offense continues to look like whatever this has been for the first half, it really does not matter. Miami’s offense has to figure out whatever is causing this, and they have to figure it out now. A 13-yard pass to Hill opened the drive, but then running back Jeff Wilson, Jr., lost two yards. After the two-minute warning, Huntley fumbled but picked up the ball and threw an incomplete pass. On 3rd-and-12, Huntley again fumbled, this time as he was being sacked, and the Jets recovered. The Dolphins simply have not shown up today. It is pretty bad. I wish I had more to say in these reactions, but at this point, it is just an embarrassing performance. Three 13-yard gains made up the entire drive. Hall ran for 13, Rodgers threw to tight end Kenny Yeboah for 13 yards, and Rodgers found Lazard on a slant for 13 yards and the touchdown. The Jets converted on the two-point try. Yep, that seems about right. The Dolphins just are getting smacked around right now. Meanwhile, the Broncos have extended their lead to 24-0 at the half. Jets 15-6. Wide receiver Malik Washington returned the kickoff for 67 yards, giving Miami a chance to get back into this game. Achane picked up three yards on first down, then Washington caught a pass for eight yards. After an incomplete pass on 1st-and-10 from the Jets’ 16-yard line, Huntley threw a deep pass to the endzone looking for Waddle, but it was intercepted by New York. That seems right at this point. A great play rewarded by a miserable offense that just cannot do anything. The Dolphins have to change something at halftime, because this just does not cut it. The Jets ran for two yards and let the clock reach halftime. This is unacceptable and embarrassing. The Dolphins entered today needing a win to have five-straight winning seasons and a chance at their third-straight playoff appearance. They showed up looking like a team not interested in winning. They are lifeless and do not seem interested in doing anything as a team. Even when an individual makes a great play, like Dodson’s interception, Ramsey’s hit and pass break up, the sack by Sieler and Ogbah, or Washington’s great kick return, the team does absolutely nothing. This is an embarrassment, plain and simple. This team is playing like they do not even have pride in what they are doing and just want to get to the offseason. The Jets appeared to open the half with an explosive play, with Hall picking up 27 yards on an end around, but an illegal block penalty negated the play and backed up New York to their 17-yard line. Two plays later, Miami defensive tackle Calais Campbell sacked Rodgers for a nine-yard loss. The Jets would be forced to punt two plays later. The defense stepped up and now the offense better have an answer. Campbell’s sack reached his contract bonus, giving him an additional $300,000. Achane started Miami’s possession with a 12-yard run, then the Jets gifted Miami five yards on a neutral zone infraction. Huntley was then sacked for a four-yard loss, fumbling the ball but recovering it. Huntley threw to Smith on a tight end screen pass, with Smith fumbling the ball and the Jets recovering. That is now four straight turnovers for the Dolphins. Interception, fumble, interception, fumble. This is disgusting. Running back Isaiah Davis picked up 20 yards on the second play of the drive, moving New York down to the Dolphins’ 26-yard line. After Rodgers was sacked by Sieler, he threw a pass to Adams for 10 yards on the sideline. After Miami challenged the play, but the completed pass stood, the Jets faced 3rd-and-1. The Jets attempted a pass to Rodgers, with Lazard taking the pitch and looking downfield to the quarterback, but the ball was thrown away for an incomplete pass. On 4th-and-1, Sieler broke through the line and hit Allen, but the running back was able to fight forward for the first down. A pass toward Adams near the goal line was called for pass interference on cornerback Storm Duck, despite Duck being the only player looking for the ball and trying to make the catch, and the Jets were given a 1st-and-Goal from the Miami three-yard line. An incomplete pass, a run for a yard, and an incomplete pass led to a 4th down. The Jets settled for the field goal. That pass interference call was bad, but at this point, what does it matter. The Broncos now lead 31-0, in a blowout so bad CBS has changed the game they are airing. Jets 18-6 Miami opened the drive with a five-yard run from Achane and a six-yard run from Waddle. After an incomplete pass, Huntley was above to find Smith for a 12-yard gain. After Wright was stopped for a four-yard loss, Huntley returned to Smith for a five-yard gain. A 13-yard pass from Huntley to Washington converted for the first down - even after the Jets challenged the catch, but the play was upheld. Wright picked up three yards, then eight yards on back-to-back runs, but the third straight carry led to a three-yard loss. An illegal shift penalty backed Miami up even more, leading to a 2nd-and-18. Ingold picked up 12 yards on a screen pass as the quarter ended. Huntley threw to wide receiver River Cracraft to open the period, gaining 11 yards. After an incomplete pass, Achane took the ball up the middle for the 15-yard score. A complete drive from the Dolphins. They could still pull off the win, but that is trusting the offense to actually do something on another drive, something they have not proven they can do today. Was this just a one-off drive? Jets 18-13. New York opened with short passes and runs, moving from their 30-yard line out to the 44 over four plays. On the fifth play, on 3rd-and-8, Rodgers found a wide-open Lazard across the middle of the field for a 43-yard gain. Two plays later, Rodgers scrambled and, just before crossing the line of scrimmage, connected with Adams in the endzone for the touchdown. Of course. As soon as it looked like Miami might be able to climb back into the game, the defense makes a mistake and the Jets score. Lazard was handed off to a deep safety according to the scheme, but there was no safety there. Jets 25-13 Miami opened with a 15-yard pass to Smith, but then followed it with a three-yard run and two incomplete passes. On 4th-and-7, Huntley was able to scramble and find Washington for 20 yards. He then found Waddle for 17 yards, moving down to the New York 15. After throwing the ball away on first down, Huntley threw a short pass to Smith for a nine-yard gain. A two-yard loss on a Wilson run set up 4th-and-3 on the Jets’ 8-yard line. Huntley was able to find Cracraft for four yards, just passing the sticks for the first down. After an incomplete pass, Huntley found Smith for the touchdown. The Dolphins have a pulse, but it really feels like a consolation at this point. The Broncos won 38-0 to claim the final playoff position. Jets 25-20 On 3rd-and-8 three plays into the possession, Rodgers looked down the sideline to Adams, who caught a 29-yard pass to convert for a first down. After an 11-yard pass to Wilson and a four-yard run from Hall, the Jets took a timeout with 3:35 remaining in the game. After an incomplete pass, Miami declined an ineligible player downfield penalty to set up 3rd-and-6. New York converted on a 17-yard run from Hall. After a one-yard run, Miami called their last timeout. Rodgers avoided the pass rush and threw a short pass to Hall, who turned up field and scored on the six-yard catch and run. Yep, that seems about right. The Dolphins just never bothered to show up for this game. Jets 32-20. An eight-yard pass to Waddle was followed by two incomplete passes, setting up 4th-and-2 as the clock reached the two-minute warning. Huntley was able to scramble for the first down, but the clock continued to run and Miami had to hurry to the line. Huntley threw over the middle to Cracraft for 15 yards, then again for eight yards. After a New York timeout, Huntley threw to Smith for four yards. A holding penalty negated a six-yard gain from Achane, with Huntley then sacked for a six-yard loss. The game, and season, ended there. Just...thank goodness it is over. This game was just an embarrassment. There were some individual flashes throughout the game, but as a whole, the team just did not show up. They had a chance to finish with a winning record. They had a chance - if the Chiefs had not packed it in for Week 18 - to make the playoffs. And they came out unable to do anything. The defense started the game well, but when the offense could not do anything, the defense lost steam. Special teams made plays, but again, the offense could not do anything. When the offense finally found itself late, the defense was done and the Jets answered every score. This game leaves the Dolphins with a ton of questions that have to be answered. After all of the contract extensions this offseason and summer, it seems like the team will run it back for 2025 with much the same core, but there has to be a lot of introspection and self-evaluation to figure out what has happened and how to fix it. This offseason is going to be an important one for Miami. They have built this team to win now, and they did not win. How can they make sure 2025 is not another waste of a year. Gambling Problem?

                "content": "Tyreek Hill (born March 1, 1994) is an American professional football wide receiver for the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Garden City, Oklahoma State, and West Alabama before being drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in the fifth round of the 2016 NFL draft. A former track and field star, Hill played primarily as a return specialist as a rookie, but has transitioned to strictly playing wide receiver. Following his rookie year, he received the nickname \"Cheetah\" in reference to his speed.[1] He has been selected to the Pro Bowl in each of his eight seasons in the league, won Super Bowl LIV with the Chiefs, and was named to the NFL 2010s All-Decade Team as a punt returner. Hill was born on March 1, 1994, and is the son of Anesha Sanchez and Derrick Shaw.[2] A native of Douglas, Georgia, Hill attended Coffee High School, where he won both the 100 meters and 200 meters at the 2012 Georgia 5A state meet.[3][4] On May 26, 2012, at the 36th Golden South Classic in Orlando, Florida, Hill ran a new season-best in the 100 m (10.19 s) and a personal record in the 200 m (20.14 s).[5] His time in the 200 m missed Roy Martin's 1985 national high school record by only one hundredth of a second. Hill's mark was the fastest time by a junior athlete in the 2012 season and the fastest by a junior athlete since Ramil Guliyev's 20.04 s in 2009. His time in the 100 m ties Abraham Hall for second fastest by a junior in the 2012 season, behind only Adam Gemili. He was Track and Field News \"High School Athlete of the Year\" in 2012.[6] Hill ran a wind-assisted (+5.0 m/s) 9.98 s in the 100-meter dash at the 2013 Hutchinson NJCCA Championships.[7][8] Hill was a USA Today All-American track and field selection in 2012.[9] At Garden City Community College in Garden City, Kansas, Hill ran track and played football. As a sophomore in 2013, Hill ran for 659 rushing yards and five touchdowns while catching 67 passes for 532 receiving yards for the Broncbusters football team.[10] Coming out of Garden City Community College, Hill was a highly sought-after junior college recruit and chose to attend Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, Oklahoma.[11] On August 30, 2014, Hill made his debut for the Cowboys and caught a season-high six passes for 62 receiving yards in a loss to the Florida State Seminoles.[12] On September 25, 2014, he caught his first career touchdown against the Texas Tech Red Raiders and finished the victory with three receptions for 50 yards, six rushing attempts for 39-yards, and three kick returns for a total of 62 yards.[13] In the following game against the Iowa State Cyclones, Hill finished with a season-high 148 kick return yards on five attempts and returned his first kick return for a touchdown of the season.[14] On November 1, 2014, he gained a season-high 102 rushing yards on 18 attempts and scored his first rushing touchdown of the season against the Kansas State Wildcats.[15] On December 6, 2014, he appeared in his last game as a part of Oklahoma State's football team and helped them win a comeback victory over their rival Oklahoma Sooners after he returned a punt for a 92-yard touchdown.[16][17] On December 11, 2014, Oklahoma State dismissed Hill from their football and track teams following his arrest and guilty plea for domestic violence.[16] In his only season at Oklahoma State, Hill had a total of 102 rushing attempts for 534 rushing yards and a touchdown, 31 receptions for 381 receiving yards and a touchdown, 30 kick returns for 740 return yards and two touchdowns, and 27 punt returns for 256 punt return yards and a touchdown. As a running back, wide receiver, and returner, he accounted for 1,911 all-purpose yards and five touchdowns. His 996 combined return yards ranked second in the nation. He was ranked 11th nationally in all-purpose yards.[18][19] On September 1, 2015, the University of West Alabama in Livingston, Alabama, announced that Hill enrolled and would play football for the Tigers.[20] West Alabama head coach Brett Gilliland said he initially turned down Hill after he read the police report, alleging that Hill choked and hit his girlfriend. But after getting to know Hill personally, he spoke to people at Oklahoma State, Hill's former coaches at Garden City Community College, and a high school mentor, and was swayed to accept him after reading his plea agreement, which required that Hill either attend school full-time or be employed.[21] On the field, Hill was utilized widely as a running back (25 carries for 237 yards and one touchdown), wide receiver (27 receptions for 444 yards and a touchdown), punt returner (20 returns averaging 10.7 yards with two touchdowns), and kick returner (also 20 returns averaging 23.0 yards with two touchdowns). In his 11 games for the team, he never exceeded 100 yards rushing or receiving and averaged 135 all-purpose yards until a 307-all-purpose-yard game against Delta State in Game 8. After this, his production tapered off quickly to a season-ending −3 all-purpose-yards against the North Alabama Lions.[22] Hill was projected to go undrafted during the 2016 NFL draft, predominantly due to his domestic violence arrest. He was not invited to the NFL Combine, but was able to showcase his abilities at West Alabama's Pro Day. Scouts were impressed with his speed and his Pro Day workout.[23] His head coach at West Alabama said that at least 20 NFL teams were interested in Hill.[24] In the 2016 NFL Draft, Hill was selected by the Kansas City Chiefs in the fifth round (165th overall).[25] He was the first player from West Alabama to be drafted since 1974, when Ken Hutcherson was drafted 97th overall by the Dallas Cowboys.[21] The Chiefs were criticized by fans[26] for the selection due to his past issues with domestic violence and the Chiefs' history with former linebacker Jovan Belcher. General manager John Dorsey had to receive consent from Chiefs' owner Clark Hunt to make the selection and says they thoroughly vetted Hill, which included speaking to the prosecutor that charged him. After drafting him, the Chiefs held a press conference and addressed the issue to the media during the first day of rookie minicamp.[27] On May 17, 2016, the Chiefs signed Hill to a four-year, $2.58 million contract that included $100,000 guaranteed and a signing bonus of $70,000.[28] Hill began the 2016 season as the Chiefs' starting punt returner, kick returner, and fourth wide receiver on the depth chart behind veterans Jeremy Maclin, Chris Conley, and Albert Wilson.[29] In the Chiefs' season opener, he made his first NFL catch for a nine-yard touchdown pass from Alex Smith as the Chiefs came back from down 21–3 to defeat the San Diego Chargers 33–27 in overtime.[30] During Week 8, Hill caught five passes for a season-high 98 yards and a touchdown during a 30–14 road victory over the Indianapolis Colts.[31] Two weeks later, he had a season-high ten catches for 89 yards, helping the Chiefs come back from a 17–0 deficit and defeat the Carolina Panthers by a score of 20–17.[32] During a Week 12 30–27 overtime road victory against the Denver Broncos, Hill returned a kickoff for an 86-yard touchdown, ran for a three-yard touchdown, and caught a three-yard touchdown pass with less than five seconds left in the fourth quarter. He was the first player with a kick return for a touchdown, rushing touchdown, and receiving touchdown in a single game since Gale Sayers did so for the Chicago Bears in 1965.[33][34] During his return, he reached a speed of 22.77 miles per hour (36.64 km/h), the fastest speed any NFL player had reached that season.[35] His performance earned him American Football Conference (AFC) Offensive Player of the Week.[36] In Week 14, Hill returned a punt against the Oakland Raiders for a 78-yard touchdown and caught six receptions for 66 yards and scored on a 36-yard touchdown reception, helping the Chiefs win 21–13 on Thursday Night Football and move to first place in the AFC West.[37] He was named AFC Special Teams Player of the Week for his performance in Week 14.[38] Two weeks later against the Broncos, Hill had a season-high six carries for 95 rushing yards and scored a 70-yard rushing touchdown in a 33–10 victory. In the regular-season finale, he caught five passes for 46 receiving yards, had three carries for 15 rushing yards, and a 95-yard punt return for a touchdown in a 37–27 win over the Chargers. His performance against the Chargers earned him his second AFC Special Teams Player of the Week honor.[39][40] Hill finished his rookie season with 61 receptions for 593 receiving yards and six touchdowns, 24 carries for 267 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns, 14 kick returns for a total of 384 yards and a touchdown, and 39 punt returns for 592 yards and two touchdowns.[41] His punt return yards, touchdowns, and 15.2 yards per return average all ranked first in the NFL. He also appeared in all 16 games, had one start, and made seven combined tackles.[32] He was named to the 2017 Pro Bowl as a return specialist.[42] On January 6, 2017, Hill was named First-team All-Pro as a punt returner.[43] He was named to the NFL All-Rookie Team for the 2016 season.[44] Hill was ranked 36th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017.[45] On September 7, 2017, in the season opening game against the defending Super Bowl champion, the New England Patriots, Hill finished with a career-high 133 receiving yards on seven receptions, which included a 75-yard reception for a touchdown, as the Chiefs won on the road by a score of 42–27.[46] In Week 5, against the Houston Texans, he recorded an 82-yard punt return touchdown in the fourth quarter.[47] During Week 8 against the Broncos on Monday Night Football, Hill threw the first interception of the Chiefs' season on a failed trick play.[48] In the next game against the Cowboys, he scored a 56-yard touchdown pass from Alex Smith on an unconventional end-of-half play. The Chiefs lined up like they were going to try a Hail Mary and Smith threw an underneath check-down pass to Hill who had a convoy of blockers clear enough space for him to maneuvere to the end zone for the touchdown.[49][50] During Week 13 against the New York Jets, Hill had 185 receiving yards on six receptions and two touchdowns, which included a 79-yard touchdown, but the Chiefs lost on the road by a score of 31–38.[51] On December 19, 2017, Hill was named to his second Pro Bowl as a return specialist.[52] Hill finished his second professional season with 75 receptions for 1,183 yards and seven touchdowns. In addition, he had 25 punt returns for 204 net yards and a return touchdown.[53] The Chiefs finished the 2017 season atop the AFC West with a 10–6 record and made the playoffs.[54] In the narrow 22–21 loss to the Tennessee Titans in the Wild Card Round, Hill finished with seven receptions for 87 yards and a 14-yard rush.[55] He was selected to his second straight Pro Bowl as a return specialist for the AFC.[56] Hill was ranked 40th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2018.[57] During Week 1 against the Los Angeles Chargers, Hill returned his first touch, a punt return, 91 yards for a touchdown. He also had 7 receptions for 169 yards and two touchdowns as the Chiefs won 38–28. In the game, he hauled in a 58-yard touchdown pass, his 13th-career touchdown of over 50 yards and Patrick Mahomes's first career touchdown pass. For the second time in his NFL career, he recorded three touchdowns in a single game.[58][59] In the next game, he caught five passes for 90 yards and another touchdown against the Pittsburgh Steelers.[60] After three less-impressive games, Hill again recorded three receiving touchdowns on seven receptions for 142 yards against the Patriots during a Week 6 43–40 road loss.[61] Four weeks later, Hill had his third 100-yard receiving game, with seven receptions for 117 yards and two touchdowns, along with a 20-yard rush, in a Week 10 victory over the Arizona Cardinals.[62] In the next game on Monday Night Football, Hill recorded 10 catches for a career-high 215 yards (and the most by any NFL receiver at that point in the season) and two touchdowns in a 54–51 road loss to the Los Angeles Rams.[63] Hill finished the season with a career-high 87 receptions for 1,479 yards and 12 touchdowns.[64] He finished second on the team in receptions behind Travis Kelce and led the team in receiving yards and touchdowns.[65] He also finished fourth in the league in receiving yards and touchdowns, and led the league in 20+ and 40+ yard receptions. He was named to his third straight Pro Bowl and was named first-team All-Pro in the \"flex\" position and second-team All-Pro as a wide receiver.[66] In the Divisional Round against the Colts, he had eight receptions for 72 receiving yards to go along with a 36-yard rushing touchdown in the 31–13 victory.[67] In the AFC Championship, he had a single reception for 42 yards in the 37–31 overtime loss to the Patriots.[68] He was ranked 19th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2019.[69] On April 26, 2019, Chiefs general manager Brett Veach announced that Hill was suspended from team activities as a result of the ongoing child abuse investigation.[70] The NFL announced on July 19 that he will not be disciplined for the investigation because the league felt he did not violate the personal conduct policy.[71] On September 6, 2019, Hill signed a three-year, $54 million extension.[72] In the season opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Hill injured his shoulder. He was taken to the hospital as a precaution.

This would be the couple's first child together.[156] In March 2023, Hill's son with Camille Valmon was born.[157] On January 3, 2024, Hill's residence in Southwest Ranches, Florida caught fire. Firefighters took approximately 45 minutes to extinguish the blaze.[158] An investigation revealed that a child inside the estate was playing with a cigarette lighter, which triggered the blaze.[159] On December 12, 2014, Hill was arrested in Stillwater, Oklahoma on complaints of assault of his 20-year-old pregnant girlfriend, Crystal Espinal. The police report states that the two got into an argument and he threw her around \"like a ragdoll\", punched her in the face, sat on her and repeatedly punched her in the stomach, and choked her.[160] Oklahoma State dismissed him from the football team after the charges.[161] Hill eventually pleaded guilty to domestic assault and battery by strangulation and was sentenced to three years of probation, an anger-management course, a year-long batterer's program, and was required to undergo a domestic-abuse evaluation, a sentence that Espinal was consulted about and said she was comfortable with.[27][162] Espinal eventually gave birth to a boy.[24][163] In March 2019, Hill was investigated for alleged battery after an incident in which his 3-year-old son sustained a broken arm.[164] The following month, his son was placed into care of child services temporarily as a result of an emergency hearing conducted by the Kansas Department of Children and Families.[165] On April 24, Johnson County District Attorney Steve Howe released a statement, saying that his office believed a crime had been committed but the evidence did not allow them to determine the perpetrator, and that the Kansas Department of Children and Families continued to investigate.[165] The following day, an audio recording of Hill and Espinal discussing the injury to their son and the subsequent investigation was released.[165] In the recording that surfaced, Hill and his fiancée discuss their son's broken arm; she says that their son is scared of him, to which Hill responds, \"You should be afraid of me too, bitch.\"[166] As a result, the criminal investigation into Hill was re-opened.[167] On June 7, prosecutors announced the case against Hill was inactive.[168] On June 10, reports surfaced that medical investigations showed his son's arm was broken by accident and in a way that indicated it was broken bracing for a fall.[169] On July 9, 2019, the full unedited audio from the recording was released. In the full audio, Hill accuses Espinal of lying about the domestic violence accusations in 2014 and about Hill breaking their son's arm.[170] The NFL stated they have always had the full audio of the recording.[171] On July 19, 2019, the NFL released a statement saying that Hill will not be suspended and that they found no evidence that Hill violated the personal conduct policy, but the incident will be re-examined if new evidence emerges.[172] On June 18, 2023, the Miami-Dade Police Department announced they were investigating Hill for allegedly assaulting a male employee of the Haulover Marine Center following the two having a verbal disagreement.[173] Later that same month, representatives for both Hill and the Haulover Marine Center employee announced a settlement had been reached.[174] In August 2023, the NFL announced that they would not be punishing Hill for the assault incident.[175] In December 2023, it was announced that two separate paternity lawsuits for child support were filed against Hill by Brittany Lackner and Kimberly Kaylee Baker, both gave birth to Hill's alleged children in 2023.[176] In February 2024, Hill reached a confidential settlement with Lackner and confirmed he was the father of her son.[177] In July 2024, a Broward County judge ruled that Hill was in fact the father of Baker's daughter Trae Love Hill. It has been reported that Hill could possibly be the father of at least ten children with four different women.[178] On February 23, 2024, model and influencer Sophie Hall filed a civil lawsuit against Hill, alleging that he had broken her leg during a football lesson at his house the previous June when he invited her to run offensive line drills against him. The suit said she held her own on a couple of plays, frustrating him, before one hard play caused the fracture.[179][180] Hill's lawyer disputed her account and said her injury resulted from her falling over a dog that interrupted one of the plays.[181] On September 8, 2024, hours before the Miami Dolphins were set to begin their season opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Hill was pulled over by officers outside of the Dolphins stadium while he was on his way to the game. Video, which was filmed by fans, was uploaded to social media and instantly made national news. The video showed Hill being detained in handcuffs and forced to the ground by three officers who were on top of him holding him down. Following the game Hill said that he was accused of speeding and reckless driving and had no idea why the situation escalated like it did. \"I wasn't disrespectful because my mom didn't raise me that way. Didn't cuss. Didn't do none of that. So like I said, I'm still trying to figure it out, man.\" Steadman Stahl, president of the South Florida Police Benevolent Association, said Hill wasn't being cooperative and that he was \"redirected\" to the ground after refusing to sit when he was briefly detained. Julius B. Collins, Hill's attorney, said that the traffic stop escalated when Hill gave officers his license and rolled his window back up. \"One of the officers then knocked on Mr. Hill's driver side window and advised Mr. Hill to keep his window rolled down otherwise he was going to get him out of the car\" and that officers followed policy in handcuffing Hill. \"Mr. Hill was not immediately cooperative with the officers on the scene who, pursuant to policy and for their immediate safety, placed Mr. Hill in handcuffs. Mr. Hill, still uncooperative, refused to sit on the ground and was therefore redirected to the ground. Once the situation was sorted out within a few minutes, Mr. Hill was issued two traffic citations and was free to leave” Stahl said. Hill's teammate, Calais Campbell, who was also on his way to the game, stopped and got involved in an attempt to de-escalate the situation. Campbell got out of his car with his hands up above his head and approached the scene, informing officers that he was a friend of Hill's. He remained at the scene to \"support\" Hill after he said officers asked him to leave. Police later placed him in handcuffs for \"disobeying a direct order\" by being too close. \"They were trying to yank him down to the ground. I saw them kick him and pull him down ... I feel like one officer was pushing on his head\" Campbell said to ESPN. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis discussed the incident saying \"I was pleased to see he did well in the game and it was good for the team, what happened on the field. I have confidence in agencies throughout this state that they want to uphold the highest standards of professionalism and if for some reason that wasn't followed here I know they will make that clear. But I'll let that investigation take place.\" One of the officers involved was placed on administrative leave following the incident and pending an internal investigation. Miami-Dade Police director Stephanie Daniels told the Miami Herald that the decision to place the officer on leave came after a review of the body camera footage from the roadside incident. Despite the incident, Hill played in that afternoon's game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, where he finished with seven catches for 130 yards and one touchdown in a 20–17 win.[182] In the weeks following the incident, Hill announced an effort to combat police misconduct, hiring several attorneys including civil rights attorney Devon M. Jacob, to bring the issue to public attention. Jacob told the media that “Tyreek intends to continue the national movement for necessary police reform that George Floyd’s death started. Tyreek is demanding that Congress finally pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.\"[183][184]",

Following the game, the Dolphins’ wide receiver sent a strong message about his future heading into the 2024 NFL season. According to Tyreek Hill’s statements, he doesn’t want to continue playing for the Miami Dolphins and is definitely looking to move on from the franchise, saying, “I’m opening the door. I’m out, bro. It was great playing here, but at the end of the day, I gotta do what’s best for my career.” Hill joined the team in 2022 and put up impressive numbers, earning multiple award nominations. One key phrase from Hill’s statement was, “I’m too much of a competitor to be just out there.” This could be an indirect message about the difficult season the Dolphins have faced, plagued by injuries and strategic issues.

                "content": "Editions: En/nfl/miami-dolphins The Pro Bowl wide receiver expresses doubts about his future with Miami following a season-ending defeat to the Jets The Miami Dolphins'season came to a frustrating end on Sunday with a 32-20 loss to the New York Jets, officially eliminating them from playoff contention. The defeat not only capped off a disappointing season but also raised eyebrows after star wide receiver Tyreek Hill hinted at a potential departure from the team. Hill, who did not play during the Dolphins' final two possessions, expressed his frustration in the locker room postgame. \"This is my first time not making the playoffs,\"Hill said.\"I have to do what's best for me and my family-if that's here or somewhere else. I'm about to open that door for myself... I'm out, bruh. It was great playing here, but at the end of the day, I have to do what's best for my career.\" The Pro Bowl wide receiver, known for his electric playmaking abilities, finished the 2024 season with just 959 receiving yards and six touchdowns-his lowest production since joining the Dolphins in 2022. Sunday's game against the Jets exemplified his struggles, with Hill managing only two catches for 20 yards. While head coach Mike McDaniel confirmed that Hill's absence in the fourth quarter was not due to an injury, he declined to comment on Hill's postgame remarks. \"It's not the time to make rash judgments,\"McDaniel said.\"We'll have conversations this week and find clarity.\" Related: Adding fuel to the fire, Hill posted a cryptic message on social media that seemed to bid farewell to Dolphins fans. \"Love fin nation blessing yall opened doors for the Hill family forever,\" he wrote on X. The Dolphins' loss was compounded by scoreboard updates from other games. A Denver Broncos blowout win over the Kansas City Chiefs dashed Miami's playoff hopes, leaving players, like veteran Calais Campbell, playing \"for the love of the game.\" Hill's frustrations punctuated a season that saw Miami post a losing record for the first time under McDaniel, despite a roster filled with talent. Hill, who restructured his contract earlier this year, has two years remaining on his deal, which includes $106.5 million in guaranteed money. Whether he pushes for a trade or reconciles with the Dolphins remains to be seen. For now, Miami's leadership, including McDaniel and general manager Chris Grier, will return for 2025, according to a statement from owner Stephen Ross. Stability at the top could help the team navigate what could be an offseason of significant change. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved. Follow us",

Quarterback Jordan Love, who left the win early due to an elbow injury, told reporters after Sunday's game he was still experiencing numbness in his throwing hand, though he expects to suit up for next week's wild-card playoff matchup with the Philadelphia Eagles. Love initially lost feeling in his right hand after falling on his arm and didn't feel 100% even after sitting out the entire second half of Sunday's 24-22 win. NBC Sports reported earlier that Love hit his funny bone, suffering an injury similar to what Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen overcame this winter, while coach Matt LaFleur said after the game Love was held out as a precaution. Asked specifically if he likes his chances of playing in Philadelphia, Love was blunt: \"Yes.\" In the event Love cannot go against the Eagles, Malik Willis would be in line to start. The former Tennessee Titans prospect saw extensive action Sunday, completing 76.9% of his pass attempts against the Bears. Willis also went 2-0 replacing an injured Love earlier this season. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.
